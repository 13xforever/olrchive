1
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:16,687
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was any doubt that we're in the era of subscription services, now comes Chuck E. Cheese to capitalize on the keep paying us money and forget to unsubscribe gravy train.

2
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:20,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And to add insult to injury, keep paying us money and you're not allowed to stop for the first year.

3
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:24,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Munch's make-believe ban has been successful because legal fees are going to take a chunk out of that recurring revenue.

4
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Such is the originality of private equity in a renowned franchise.

5
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,590
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Late Stage Capitalism intro.

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, James Somers, and Loki to tell me more about this and other news about games and not just child gambling.

7
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:46,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:48,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:56,433
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live once again with episode number 1014 of our show for tonight, August 18th of 2024.

11
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:59,835
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by my co-hosts.

12
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,898
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:03,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.

14
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:04,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, how are you?

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Worn the fuck out.

16
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:08,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Busy day?

17
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday.

18
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:14,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a 12-hour... That's right.

19
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:23,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I was out most of the day, but I saw you... I popped in and out for like two minutes because I saw that you were streaming, but unfortunately I was gone most of the day yesterday.

20
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,927
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, oh, okay.

21
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:28,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my last-minute half-assed pseudo-sub-a-thon.

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it fun?

23
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:41,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I had fun, but man, I didn't feel all that great because I'm on, today's my last day for my antibiotics for a bacterial sinus infection.

24
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, yeah, it was feeling pretty rough.

25
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Midna, no, you can't have my quesadilla.

26
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:50,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

27
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:55,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Her highness is down there trying to get to my quesadilla.

28
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:00,095
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too hot for you, baby!

29
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was... I did make it the 12 hours out of Pure Spite.

30
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:19,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And Starlock, Sia Tabiri, Star Taco were my... I have to thank all three of you for helping me pay for food at TwitchCon now.

31
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So... But I...

32
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of fun.

33
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:31,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hang out with Ryan and Shay and Smokey and a bunch of my friends and regulars.

34
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you playing the, I remember now when I dropped in, you were playing the Cult of the Lamb expansion, it looked like.

35
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:37,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I was.

36
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so hopefully that was fun.

37
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:39,997
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so good.

38
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:40,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good.

39
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:41,677
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty fun.

40
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:42,317
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

41
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:45,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

42
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:46,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

43
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:47,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Loki.

44
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:47,899
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

45
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:49,177
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

46
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:55,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So before the show started tonight, our little intro we do live for the live listeners only.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,963
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's just a cute little bumper inspired by you can't do that on television.

48
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,744
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be like such and such will not be seen tonight.

49
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:14,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And tonight was conquered Cusar because the news came down the line that after 32 years, the Cusar and conquered California is closing, to which my first reaction was it was still open.

50
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't close during COVID.

51
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought QZAR as a brand was like gone, gone.

52
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:25,816
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought of you, Loki, because I was like, I think you said you went there not terribly long ago.

53
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe it was a while ago.

54
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:29,298
[SPEAKER_05]: It was terribly long ago at this point, yeah.

55
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:31,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the Vacaville, there was one in Vacaville.

56
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that, the Vacaville one, I don't think is there either.

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The Vacaville one, yeah, appears to be, they've replaced the system in it.

58
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because the bowling alley changed hands.

59
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:42,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize that until I went there for a work thing.

60
00:03:44,573 --> 00:04:11,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where there's still QZAR if there's one in Runner Park or not I think that might be like the last one in the area but yeah I mean that kind of happens when you're the company that makes the packs goes under several times and you know typically it doesn't people don't normally want to carry those old packs that you can't find parts for anymore and stuff like that so it's which sucks because QZAR is super fun we should make OLRs

61
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:28,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it would be a very cheap venture there was a time that I wanted to get a set of packs but I probably could do it pretty cheap nowadays if you hit it up just right but yeah it's

62
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:56,373
[SPEAKER_06]: is it was it used to be unfortunately yeah I hear you I hear you all right well um yeah in chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific at twitch.tv twitch television VOG Network VOG Network is the channel uh that you want to check out here and yeah I'm reading some comments and people are reminiscing a bit about QZAR from the bumper tonight uh Bobby Blackwolf is saying

63
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:03,977
[SPEAKER_06]: who, of course, we do tape live right after Bobby Blackwolf, says there were literally three in the Atlanta area at one time and one out in Athens, my college town.

64
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Sia says, I never got to go to QZAR.

65
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I did visit Laser Force a couple times, even once during a lock-in where I got to try the Battletech pods.

66
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:15,123
[SPEAKER_06]: S. Joe and Hunter Matt saying, apparently there is a QZAR in Long Island.

67
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:19,366
[SPEAKER_06]: They've also ventured into QAX for axe throwing.

68
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:19,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha!

69
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:31,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's a growing thing that you see at random places downtown, but I did not have my money on QZAR going from laser tag to throwing axes.

70
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:34,413
[SPEAKER_06]: How about laser axes?

71
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:35,173
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be cool.

72
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:37,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what was going through my head right now?

73
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:37,755
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

74
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay.

75
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:42,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I sleep all night and I work all day.

76
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:50,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I did one of those things that like, I feel like they did like an axe throwing at like one of the Final Fantasy fan festivals.

77
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I was terrible at it.

78
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrible at it.

79
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of course I was.

80
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:54,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I was.

81
00:05:55,532 --> 00:06:00,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, we're going to get into, of course, video gaming news, as we do every week here on the show.

82
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:02,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk to you a little bit later in the show.

83
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be at DragonCon in a couple weeks.

84
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:07,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk all about that, but we'll get to our kickoff topic first.

85
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:13,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, and as far as the conventions go, I'm going to be at DragonCon in two weeks, so I have a bit to say about that tonight.

86
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:19,254
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura and Loki will be at TwitchCon in about, what, five weeks or so?

87
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:19,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's...

88
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,557
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DragonCon

89
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:42,877
[SPEAKER_06]: and a reminder to folks, Gamescom is this week.

90
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And why is this a big deal?

91
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:54,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually there isn't as huge of a focus on Gamescom because a lot of gaming companies used to use E3 as their time to make gaming announcements.

92
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:58,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm not quite saying Gamescom is the new E3.

93
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:58,783
[SPEAKER_06]: However...

94
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:12,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel like with the news cycle being a little bit slower, there might be more companies that have been holding on to things for Gamescom that may otherwise have usually been in that June timeframe.

95
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:18,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I think case in point would be something like the Civilization VII unveil, which we talked about a couple weeks ago or last week on the show.

96
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:24,878
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that Civilization VII is going to get unveiled actually in two days on Tuesday just before

97
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:52,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamescom 4 opens up and people will get to either see it or experience the game somehow on the show floor so I'm just kind of like curious like what is you know what is the new rhythm gonna look like in this post E3 world and so it's gonna be interesting to see what Gamescom is all about now of course y'all should be like it was last year because E3 as it was last year was not a thing so

98
00:07:52,967 --> 00:08:02,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of these PR campaigns, they're scheduled a long ways out, and a lot of people were operating under the assumption, whether we knew it was bullshit or not, that E3 was going to come back.

99
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's like there is no –

100
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,350
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:30,978
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

102
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,210
[SPEAKER_06]: What we might get out of it after all.

103
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's off the table to see things like Final Fantasy 16 PC port.

104
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:52,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we know it's coming, but dated like PC port dated or maybe this Xbox thing.

105
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:56,518
[SPEAKER_06]: If rumors pans out, I think there's still some little things that we could.

106
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'd call Final Fantasy 16 a little thing.

107
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you heard this other rumor.

108
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of like PlayStation games going to Xbox, there's the other way around.

109
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:08,324
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this huge rumor about Forza Horizon 5 is going to show up on PlayStation 5.

110
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,026
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's a Gamescom thing.

111
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:14,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, that means literally nothing.

112
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:20,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, Xbox's best game, best game going over to PlayStation.

113
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:29,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they're throwing in the towel now, it says all the conspiracy theorist people or like maybe, I don't know, they just want to sell more copies of the game.

114
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a crazy idea there.

115
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:32,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

116
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:37,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Industry where they want to make as much money as possible that they're going to try to make more money.

117
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.

118
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some way out there ideas.

119
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:50,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Show you this fucking series you've been missing for so long by not having an Xbox by the time Forza Horizon 6 comes out first on Game Pass before anywhere else.

120
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:55,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're going to be a little more likely to check out what it's all about.

121
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:57,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a bigger strategy behind it.

122
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, the doomsdayers need to just

123
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Be quiet.

124
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:01,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit down.

125
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's going to be interesting.

126
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think at the end of the day, the consumer kind of wins a little bit, which I think is really exciting.

127
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, not a lot else to say about that.

128
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: But just, you know, Gamescom is this week.

129
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:16,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're expecting we'll get a nice intake of news in this next week or so.

130
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, if you do want to watch the opening night live, it is Tuesday afternoon.

131
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:24,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, Gamescom is based in Europe.

132
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be 2 o'clock.

133
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:31,717
[SPEAKER_06]: For the East Coast, I think the East Coast is 2 o'clock, and I think for us on the West Coast, it's like 11 a.m.

134
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,898
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way I can watch.

135
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:40,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at a work event that's going to take my attention all day, so there's no way I can watch, but I'll definitely want to catch up on all the news later.

136
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:43,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So, exciting stuff.

137
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move into some other news to kick off our show tonight.

138
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:51,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you talk about some updates going on with Steam?

139
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so Steam is cracking down on a few different things.

140
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:59,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting off with, of course, joke reviews.

141
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: You see a lot of these, you know, popping up with different things.

142
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of it's pretty harmless, but they want to kind of just have...

143
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,038
[SPEAKER_05]: some of that stuff taken out of there.

144
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:12,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ridiculous.

145
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:21,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the examples they show in different screenshots are full of ASCII art and stuff like that, memeing on different things.

146
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:26,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, how they're identifying joke reviews.

147
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:36,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, players may still see humorous but unhelpful reviews, but the goal is that they show up far less often when people are trying to learn about the game.

148
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:44,359
[SPEAKER_05]: and says they will be using some machine learning algorithms to try to identify them.

149
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Good lord.

150
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:45,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yuck.

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,463
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have to at that point because there's so many of it.

152
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:50,604
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a numbers game.

153
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay if the machine flags it for a human to review.

154
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:55,347
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

155
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:59,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think it's necessarily that they're getting rid of those reviews.

156
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:07,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're just deprioritizing them so that they're further on down the review list, I guess, would be my...

157
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what they're doing with that.

158
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:18,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get the ASCII art and some of the shitposting like that, but what if I want to be very tongue-in-cheek and maybe invoke a meme or something into it?

159
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:35,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say, okay, I'm going to write a review for Stardew Valley, and I'm going to say, this is a game that's very chill for me to play, and when I'm playing this game, I feel very demure, very mindful, very, you know, am I going to get penalized for invoking TikTok memes?

160
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:45,961
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because it's about how people respond to your review and whether they check it as a helpful or unhelpful review.

161
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be the ones that essentially are unhelpful.

162
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:50,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, can't I just go in and mark all your reviews unhelpful?

163
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:52,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I troll Loki by doing that?

164
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:55,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

165
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't review things so hot.

166
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: You got me, bitch.

167
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ever review stuff in text.

168
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:03,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll review stuff on YouTube.

169
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll always be unhelpful.

170
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:10,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

171
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:20,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I mean, this also begs the question, like, are Steam reviews... I mean, I always kind of saw Steam reviews as a bit of a cesspool anyway.

172
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:26,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, do you all really let Steam reviews dictate if you're going to buy a game or not?

173
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:27,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

174
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:27,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

175
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,541
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

176
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:37,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I glance over like if it's something I've never heard of to try to get an idea of like what kind of game it is.

177
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,725
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that.

178
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm with you.

179
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I might use it to like gauge the temperature.

180
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:46,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so some comments in chat.

181
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,790
[SPEAKER_06]: DW Wreckage in chat says, nope, never.

182
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,232
[SPEAKER_06]: FifthDream in chat says, I look at them to see if a game is technically broken or not.

183
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:59,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like so I might like kind of look, but I don't make a decision until I watch a YouTube or a Twitch stream.

184
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:10,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I'm on the fence about a game, I always will look for a Twitch stream of a real person playing through it and what it looks like or YouTube that's not heavily edited that shows a little bit of like raw gameplay.

185
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,083
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I really make my decisions, to be honest.

186
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:15,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

187
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:15,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

188
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:21,908
[SPEAKER_06]: DW Records and Chat also adds, if it's mostly negative, I'll look into it more.

189
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:26,092
[SPEAKER_06]: But normally, if there's a game for a good price, I get it regardless.

190
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:37,102
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point as well, is that even if a game is overly negative, if the game is on sale for $1.99, maybe it's a niche thing that you might like.

191
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:40,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we also have heard so many times...

192
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:41,426
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

193
00:14:58,928 --> 00:14:59,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Scanning the reviews.

194
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think of things that have been review bombed recently.

195
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:09,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Scanning the reviews for Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail for people posting anti-trans shit because one of the voice actresses in the game.

196
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit should be de-emphasized, of course.

197
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:17,182
[SPEAKER_06]: But that impacts a score.

198
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:21,265
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I don't pay attention to the score sometimes because games get review bombed, right?

199
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:46,080
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah all right we'll see how this plays out ultimately affects things I don't think it affects it very much but we'll see no no I don't think so um and then as far as other things they're cracking down on it's also going to be they're going to be cracking down on the actual store pages for different games and limiting what types of information can be shared um

200
00:15:46,440 --> 00:16:15,377
[SPEAKER_05]: mainly just three specific things so no linking to other websites they don't want you to link to like your social media pages or other things like that externally because they do have dedicated links for that type of stuff no embedding imagery that mimics Steam store UI and buttons I mean that's pretty self-explanatory and then no images links or widgets pointing to other games on Steam so you can't link to other products

201
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:32,846
[SPEAKER_05]: but, um, cool I don't think it seems to, I don't think it's really going to affect much of how Steam operates other than maybe cracking down on some of this scamming stuff, especially linking out to other sites, I don't know

202
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

203
00:16:53,152 --> 00:17:00,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, you know, I mean, well, what if you were to say from the creators of such and such game, but you're not linking to the games in that case, I guess.

204
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're not linking to them.

205
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:09,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be like kind of having a store page and then linking out to, you know, go buy my other game.

206
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

207
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know what you can.

208
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Or this game runs best when you also own this and this.

209
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,270
Yeah.

210
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah.

211
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:23,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see maybe being able to do a bundle between multiple games.

212
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see that with different developers.

213
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:28,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have a collection of games of all their stuff that they put out.

214
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:33,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a way you can point to different things, but that's technically a different store

215
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat People ruin things

216
00:17:58,757 --> 00:17:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's true.

217
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwell says, go buy my other game on itch.io.

218
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:05,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that would be really bad because then you're calling out another store.

219
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:06,739
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes a lot of sense.

220
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:07,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

221
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, don't each of the manufacturers get to make their own page and link their information there or something?

222
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it's so... I mean, and the Steam...

223
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:18,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say, I mean...

224
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:54,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I like the combination of having the machine sift through the database and then have it inspected.

225
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: But think about how much data that is.

226
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

227
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:16,478
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gonna you know I think probably one of the things is like it'll scan for links it'll scan for you know just different things on there but I don't know I feel I feel like it's a mixed bag

228
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:23,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I also can see that there's a lot of just garbage on Steam that they want to sift through.

229
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:27,666
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of the comments that people leave on Steam is that it's impossible to find shit on Steam.

230
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:33,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you don't already know what you're looking for, if it's not on the front page of the store, it's impossible to find the stuff you want to play on Steam.

231
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:38,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I can understand that they're trying to do some work to sort of combat that a little bit.

232
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,271
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's short of reinventing the store from the ground up, but when your store is that big...

233
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:48,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to be honest, I'm not sure what I would do to change Steam to make discoverability better.

234
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:49,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really not.

235
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,741
[SPEAKER_03]: They really can't do a whole bunch.

236
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:53,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

237
00:19:54,402 --> 00:20:01,690
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it really kind of puts the onus on the publisher, or if you're self-publishing, you, to get the word of your game out there.

238
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:02,391
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

239
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:03,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

240
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:11,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess all Steam can do is try to make sure the algorithm is also pushing indie games and small games as much as it's pushing AAA games.

241
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:18,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like through things they do like your discoverability queue, there are things they do in Steam where they kind of try to do that a little bit.

242
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:25,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't sit here and just shit on what they're doing because I do think they do try in some ways, but it's just so big.

243
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,242
[SPEAKER_06]: The volume of stuff on Steam is unreal.

244
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a statistic out there like how many games are on Steam?

245
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:35,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there is somewhere.

246
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:46,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know where you can find it because I know the tools that we used to have to be able to check sales and stuff like that have been kind of kneecapped a bit.

247
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:52,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if it'll show the full list of titles that are on Steam available right now.

248
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:58,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'm looking at a website called SteamDB, like Steam Database, and it does show me that in 2023...

249
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:28,773
[SPEAKER_06]: 14,452 games were released and so far in 2024 11,319 games have been released so far in 2024 with the year not over yet so I mean that may not give you a total but it still gives you a sense of the volume they're putting out over 10,000 games a year since 2021 and 2020 was damn close 2020 was 9,700 games so they've been putting out 10,000 games a year on Steam that is a lot to wrap your head around right

250
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

251
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And still no decent puzzlers.

252
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:37,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

253
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:40,596
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura needs some puzzle game recommendations, it sounds like.

254
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

255
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:48,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week, puzzle game or otherwise, in How Was Your Gaming Week?

256
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,522
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, let's go to you.

257
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:50,662
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

258
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:51,703
[SPEAKER_06]: What types of games have you been playing?

259
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's been kind of busy.

260
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:57,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Polya last night.

261
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably going to play some of that tonight because I'm tired.

262
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:07,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing the new Cult of the Lamb DLC, as you mentioned earlier.

263
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:10,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight.

264
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a decent time there.

265
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing the Suika game, the watermelon puzzle game.

266
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:21,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of addicted to that.

267
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Moonlight Mahjong, which isn't real mahjong, it's just like a solitaire matching game, really.

268
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:36,677
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been just the usual stuff, a little pinball here and there.

269
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:42,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and DW Wreckage, absolutely excited for the Castlevania DLC.

270
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

271
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:55,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't played DBD a lot in a hot minute, but I think that one might get me back, because Dracula as a killer looks badass, and I've wanted a vampire killer in that game forever, so I'm jazzed.

272
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just weird having a Belmont with no whip, you know?

273
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

274
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:04,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know quite how I feel about that.

275
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:09,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, I think it's going to be something pretty awesome.

276
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:22,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been trying to think, because I finished Castlevania, well, I'll say Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, because I was playing the Japanese version of Symphony of the Night.

277
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:28,026
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've finished that and I'm not sure what retro game I'm going to switch on to.

278
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:36,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of thinking of actually looking through a list of Japanese only games and seeing what I'm going to play through.

279
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:37,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

280
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:42,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I played X-Men, the six player X-Men at work.

281
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,386
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

282
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little award thing and they brought out the arcade one-ups.

283
00:23:54,433 --> 00:24:02,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew and I actually played through and beat the game together with him on Colossus and me on Nightcrawler, of course.

284
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:11,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I played Super Pac-Man and man, they need to fix the joystick on that machine.

285
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear it was not

286
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:16,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Pac-Man's on my little baby machine back here, and it's great.

287
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs just fine.

288
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:19,230
[SPEAKER_03]: You need control.

289
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the game may run fine, but Joystick's broken.

290
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,451
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to run fine.

291
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:25,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, that's probably heavy usage.

292
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:26,851
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a maintenance issue.

293
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:28,432
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a completely different machine.

294
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:29,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

295
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:34,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was that going on.

296
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

297
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:37,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

298
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:49,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and a little touch of Avatar thrown in here, just offline stuff, you know, looking around, but mostly it's just been what I named.

299
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

300
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,480
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

301
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't break the soundboard, SSJ100, Matt.

302
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:57,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

303
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play a whole ton of stuff other than Minecraft, really.

304
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:08,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So I worked on publishing an episode, which I did do that about a week ago.

305
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm already working on the next one.

306
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:17,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So I built a dropper ride in my theme park.

307
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:18,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.

308
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:19,114
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.

309
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:31,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, and then I've got a wild mouse that's being built in this episode, so that'll be coming soon.

310
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:34,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I could mention it because it's not really...

311
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:37,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Word of our show rolling, I think.

312
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:47,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had like a Nest Maker Direct yesterday talking about like some of the updates with the software and stuff, which, you know, I use that to make Pixel Poops number two.

313
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some exciting stuff coming down the road.

314
00:25:52,541 --> 00:26:01,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not available right now, but they're going to... They have been talking about publishing through their site that they have called the Retroverse that...

315
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:24,831
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll be doing physical versions of the games at some point where you can publish through them and they basically give you a cut anytime it sells but they handle all the other stuff with that so that's certainly an option that I want to go down when that's available because that would make it a lot easier than having to constantly make my own

316
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:42,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Cartridges and stuff like that but the other thing that's cool too they have this publishing arm that they're working with called Bitmax Games that's publishing Nesmaker games on the Switch, Xbox Steam, iOS, Android uh

317
00:26:44,145 --> 00:27:10,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was like PC, Mac, and Linux and stuff like that but anyways I'm interested in that as well so like when that comes around same type of thing they'll essentially publish your game and then give you a cut like a small cut of the sales when it gets sold so hopefully that happens sooner than later right now they also announced though too that they're kind of spinning off Nest Maker into this new thing called Retro Game Forge which is

318
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:11,426
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

319
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that'll be fun.

320
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:41,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that comes down the line and we can get that out on the Switch just so more people can play it.

321
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:42,816
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

322
00:27:42,856 --> 00:27:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

323
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:44,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's great.

324
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:52,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, I think having your game stand on its own on these storefronts instead of being hidden behind DLC of a free game will help with discoverability.

325
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, don't forget HIO, Bobby.

326
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's the case on HIO.

327
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I mean, the more the merrier, right?

328
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when, like, at this point, you've kind of written off the game.

329
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,802
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, okay, it was a labor of love.

330
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:02,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned a lot.

331
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:04,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to retire to a mansion with it.

332
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:08,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, throwing it at additional storefronts and seeing what happens, why not, right?

333
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

334
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:19,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever, Loki, have you ever thought, like I know a lot of your spare time is the Minecraft content creation and everything you do in that community.

335
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever thought about getting back on the horse and doing another NES game?

336
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't have time to do it with the Minecraft stuff.

337
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to do something maybe that isn't a toilet joke.

338
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:38,282
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as we all enjoyed that, maybe if you did something that was different, you might... Oh, you never know.

339
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:43,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe I have to see what the Super Nintendo stuff looks like.

340
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:44,664
[SPEAKER_05]: At one time, I...

341
00:28:46,758 --> 00:29:12,686
[SPEAKER_05]: something with the Playdate and the GB Studio stuff that they have that piece of software is pretty good so you could do like Game Boy games out of that pretty easy so I might look into that as well I don't know but it takes a lot of time it's not going to be something that I'm probably going to be doing within the next couple years though unfortunately because it's just don't have the time to split like that

342
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:30,150
[SPEAKER_06]: uh DJ Ranma S with a throwback in chat says we need another Loki remix okay so I'm sure I know newer listeners of OLR would not know this this goes way back but before Loki was doing the Minecraft before he was doing he was doing like I don't know if you call them mashups remixes yeah mashups

343
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:56,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, you know what I think of when I go to TikTok and I hear the cupcake remix of a certain song where, you know, it's all these nasty words, you know, to, you know, like, you know, instead of H-O-T-T-O to go, it's like, wash my ass and tits to go, you know, like, it's like, Loki would do that with like, well, not that foul, but like would take songs and kind of mash them together and do these, like, and you had some really good stuff.

344
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, honestly, to be honest, I still remember like,

345
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:22,820
[SPEAKER_06]: you did a song from In The Groove and mashed it up with Verbalicious Don't Play Nice and it sounded so good you took a song from The Matrix and mashed it up with god damn I can't remember it was the Highway song from The Matrix and you just and it was so good like yeah Loki did some really sweet remixes back in the day I wonder do you have an mp3 do you have a library of all those somewhere

346
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have them all still.

347
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:27,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to send them over.

348
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:37,599
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to put them somewhere on a Dropbox or something so we can, yeah, have those preserved, even though, sure, they're questionable, you know, legalities.

349
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,199
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff on TikTok's worse.

350
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,460
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff on TikTok's way worse.

351
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, for sure.

352
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, some of that stuff, like, I listen back to it and I'm like, oh, that was just lame.

353
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:47,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put Gravity on top of that song.

354
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,682
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

355
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really make anything, you know.

356
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:52,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

357
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:57,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's some, yeah, the, the, the, oh God, what was the verbalicious one?

358
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:05,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was Don't Play Nice and, um... It was, was the song called Zodiac or was the artist Zodiac?

359
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,912
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Zodiac was the song.

360
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:07,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

361
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:07,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

362
00:31:08,154 --> 00:31:33,303
[SPEAKER_06]: that's it it was a really good remix all right we'll have to we're gonna dig them up someday and we'll play them on the air all right uh well i i say that but then i'm like oh but then twitch has all these excuse me twitch has all these weird rules around the dj stuff now so now they're gonna be so maybe we have to play it private on discord or something because it might get weird if we try to do it here on twitch yeah i have them all here in the folder really um can you drop boxes on me

363
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:53,284
[SPEAKER_06]: uh yeah probably yes all right cool okay um all right my gaming week uh a lot of Final Fantasy 14 of course y'all know me at this point of course playing a lot of the mobile games I've actually been playing a lot more Monster Hunter now lately randomly uh trying to get my steps in in Pikmin I planted an impressive amount of flowers this week

364
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:54,964
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:27,663
[SPEAKER_06]: and then there's one other game I've been playing and I kind of am like should I talk about this or not because technically here's the thing you're not supposed to talk about this game

366
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:53,244
[SPEAKER_06]: but what's happening with this game is it's becoming like okay like you know the first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club okay 33,000 people are concurrently playing Fight Club it has hit the gaming news everybody knows about this fucking game it's just that they're trying to create this scarcity thing going on right now which was always very successful for Google products like Gmail

367
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Google Wave.

368
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:55,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, get me an invite to Google Wave.

369
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get on Google Wave.

370
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:58,229
[SPEAKER_06]: The fuck is Google Wave?

371
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but I want to be in it because it's invite only.

372
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're creating that whole scarcity thing with...

373
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:09,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve's worst kept secret of all time, Deadlock is the other game I played this week.

374
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:19,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And technically, as somebody pointed out, you can hit escape and never agree to the thing where it says don't talk about this game or whatever it is.

375
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:23,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And look, I'm not going to go in depth.

376
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:24,822
[SPEAKER_06]: There's way worse shit on YouTube.

377
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say, yeah, I've played it.

378
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:29,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very easy to invite people to it.

379
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:32,784
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know anybody on Steam that has it, they can invite you to it.

380
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would assume...

381
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:39,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamescom is when Valve is finally going to announce that this is legit and like what's going on with this.

382
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:40,286
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

383
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:40,646
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

384
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:42,907
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is.

385
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:44,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is Deadlock?

386
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,808
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Overwatch, basically.

387
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:50,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So like the heroes and that concept meets a MOBA.

388
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:51,745
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

389
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:52,546
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

390
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:54,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that sounds incredibly uninteresting.

391
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's opinion.

392
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:01,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually was really into it, what I've played of it.

393
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:09,703
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, if you don't like first-person shooters, or even it's technically not first-person because it's over the shoulder, but if you don't like those types of shooters, no, you're not going to like this.

394
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:14,468
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't like MOBAs, eh, you might not, though.

395
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:15,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

396
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:16,190
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

397
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:34,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Dota 2

398
00:34:50,507 --> 00:35:15,538
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of the characters are pretty fun I like the and I don't know their names sorry but there's a guy with a bunch of electricity shit and that's the guy like he throws these electricity grenades and can like tie two to two people together with electricity so they keep shocking each other like I I like that guy I also think it was very smart it's a very subtle but cool aesthetic to build in that to get quickly down the lanes you have zip lines and

399
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:21,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you do is if you're at the base and you want to go down a lane, you hook to a zip line and you go, woo, flying down a lane.

400
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:26,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very simple thing, but creates a really cool aesthetic and an over-the-shoulder first-person shooter.

401
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:30,219
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, was it straight out of Bioshock Infinite?

402
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, kind of.

403
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:31,561
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's...

404
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:33,407
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

405
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:49,545
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

406
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:20,546
[SPEAKER_06]: is it an Overwatch killer?

407
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:44,161
[SPEAKER_06]: no, because it's a different game it's still a MOBA at heart a traditional MOBA at heart and some people are going to be into that, some people aren't and that's really that but yeah, I'm enjoying Deadlock so far and I look forward to when more of my friends are finally on it because I sent some invites out but it can take up to a day for those people to get their invitation and a lot of people don't realize you have to check your email

408
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:53,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you think somebody invited you to Deadlock, check your email because you have to acknowledge it in the email before you can actually launch it in the store.

409
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:56,172
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's all I have to say about that.

410
00:36:56,472 --> 00:37:02,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully Valve officially announces the game this week because it's ludicrous.

411
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:06,581
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole test they're doing is silly at this point.

412
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:06,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

413
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,194
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonCon is coming up in less than two weeks!

414
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:36,974
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonCon starts on a Thursday because yes, DragonCon is so fucking stacked over Labor Day weekend on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and most of Monday.

415
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:43,922
[SPEAKER_06]: People are usually leaving and heading out of town, but they do have content on Monday that now DragonCon backs up into Thursday.

416
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: and like this is, I've seen more content this year on Thursday night than any other year prior.

417
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:51,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday night was usually like Dragon Con wrestling.

418
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they have a whole little wrestling thing they do.

419
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,269
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was usually it.

420
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, that's all they have is wrestling on Thursday night.

421
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, they've got panels, content, the works.

422
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:05,114
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing is like the Hall of Fame and the vendor halls are not open on Thursday.

423
00:38:05,154 --> 00:38:06,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, a lot of the experiences there.

424
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, oh my gosh.

425
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:09,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild, wild.

426
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I will be going to Dragon Con for the...

427
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:15,448
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

428
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:46,233
[SPEAKER_06]: until now because the app came out this week and if you actually go into the DragonCon app you can actually find me

429
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:47,627
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonCon.com

430
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:13,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday night, I will be doing a digital media kickoff.

431
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:16,778
[SPEAKER_06]: The VOG Network presents a digital media connection event.

432
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:26,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a big networking event and it's kind of like the, there's a formal panel to kick off the digital media track because Bobby's going to be on that.

433
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:34,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But then right after is more of a informal meet and greet, come hang out, meet other content creators, exchange information, ideas.

434
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to rely on a little bit of what I do with my day job to

435
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:41,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll be a fun panel.

436
00:39:56,488 --> 00:40:03,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I have a panel that's not on my schedule on Friday, but I'm going to be doing a panel.

437
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:07,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, because since I don't have it officially on my schedule, I forget the time.

438
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:08,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's at 2.30.

439
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:18,361
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have a panel on streaming retro games that I'm going to be just a panelist on unofficially because they added me at the last minute.

440
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:19,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm excited.

441
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:20,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I love retro games.

442
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:21,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited to talk about that.

443
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:26,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about my first main track panel, which is going to be on Saturday, August 31st.

444
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:31,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be moderating a panel with the voice actors from Baldur's Gate 3.

445
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:43,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And that includes, from Baldur's Gate 3, we're going to have Alena Baranova, Jennifer English, Neil Newborn, Theo Solomon, and Devorah Wilde.

446
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:45,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm incredibly angry right now.

447
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:47,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you angry?

448
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,571
[SPEAKER_06]: because you can't be happy for your friend.

449
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:54,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy for you and angry for me.

450
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:55,393
[SPEAKER_06]: You're angry for you because you're not going.

451
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Money exists.

452
00:40:58,855 --> 00:40:59,376
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

453
00:40:59,436 --> 00:40:59,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

454
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:00,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

455
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very excited about that.

456
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:10,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've played a little bit of Baldur's Gate 3, but I think you all know I did not have the best Twitch experience with that game.

457
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:16,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm doing some cramming behind the scenes to make sure I'm ready for that.

458
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,103
[SPEAKER_06]: That is still going to be a fan Q&A.

459
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:22,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So to be honest, you don't have to know a lot about a property to do a fan Q&A.

460
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is...

461
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that is going to be a thing.

462
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,451
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really excited to do it.

463
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:29,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be huge.

464
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:30,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

465
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:31,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

466
00:41:31,512 --> 00:41:35,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I also asked for Baldur's Gate 3, but Rob got it.

467
00:41:35,514 --> 00:41:37,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, yeah, it is what it is.

468
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:42,258
[SPEAKER_06]: But the funny and ironic thing is, do you know what video game panel Bobby got instead?

469
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect.

470
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,920
[SPEAKER_06]: He got the voice actors from Mass Effect.

471
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So that did kind of make me laugh.

472
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:49,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

473
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:49,963
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

474
00:41:50,243 --> 00:41:50,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

475
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:51,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I am again angry.

476
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:52,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with Quest Buster.

477
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The voice actor work throughout the game is amazing.

478
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Easily one of its strongest points.

479
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:56,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

480
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

481
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me mention some non-video game, but still really cool things I'm doing.

482
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:07,671
[SPEAKER_06]: On Saturday at 5.30 PM, I have the pleasure of doing a panel with guests from the Star Wars universe.

483
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:15,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are mostly Disney Plus shows, but Natasha Lou Bordizzo from Ahsoka is going to be there.

484
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:20,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Giancarlo Esposito, who is also in The Boys, and Mandalorian.

485
00:42:20,903 --> 00:42:22,866
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my favorite bad guy ever.

486
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, is going to be there.

487
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And Danny Trejo.

488
00:42:27,694 --> 00:42:28,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

489
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:28,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

490
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:32,545
[SPEAKER_06]: about Lost My Damn Mind when I saw that one.

491
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:34,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is going to be a very fun panel.

492
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:48,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the panel that I requested and I actually got, I'm very excited about this on Sunday, Star Trek Lower Decks, Tawny Newsome and Eugene Cordero, two of the voice actors from Star Trek's Lower Decks are going to be there.

493
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:51,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got to work with them a little bit.

494
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:51,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not work with them.

495
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:56,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to meet them and talk to them on the Star Trek cruise and they were an absolute delight.

496
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:58,502
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really excited about that one.

497
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:29,200
[SPEAKER_06]: some more games or excuse me some more panels on the digital media track streaming beyond video games that's going to be pretty interesting because we're going to talk about things that you can stream on Twitch that aren't just video games such as a podcast or hot tub stream sure I don't know if we have any hot tub streamers on the portal on the portal the panel but yes and then turning digital media skills into IRL skills that's going to be really cool because we're talking about how

498
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,921
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

499
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Zach Aguilar, Jason Librecht, and Abby Trott

500
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:19,736
[SPEAKER_06]: and Fire Emblem Three Houses and also as the characters in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

501
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:31,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is really cool because I didn't know this person went to conventions, but Abby Trott is also the singer of the English version of the theme for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

502
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:56,449
[SPEAKER_06]: that's kind of fun and she's Annette in Fire Emblem she has Ivy and Carmen Sandiego on Netflix and Windblade in the Transformers Prime Wars trilogy so yeah lots of lots of awesome resumes there so yeah that'll be a fun panel you got my attention there because that's like one of my favorites of the newer Transformers characters yeah yeah so um yeah so DragonCon this year

503
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:01,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of been hinting at this for a while is that I expect this is going to be a big year and a fun year.

504
00:45:01,996 --> 00:45:06,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And wow, I'm very humbled and grateful for this opportunity to do this.

505
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:13,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to have a good time and make sure these panels are a good time and host them for folks.

506
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I hope to see you all at DragonCon.

507
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, again, the best time to meet me

508
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:22,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf Introduce Catherine Tate

509
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,162
[SPEAKER_06]: who's of course Donna Noble, one of the companions.

510
00:45:49,562 --> 00:45:52,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's... I'm sorry, even better than that, she's Lauren.

511
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:56,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she actually, she has a very impressive, she was in the office and all that, yeah.

512
00:45:56,906 --> 00:45:59,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So she has an impressive resume, but yes.

513
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, yeah.

514
00:46:01,148 --> 00:46:02,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, SSJ100 Matt does bring up a good point.

515
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:05,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the SAG-AFTRA stuff gets resolved soon.

516
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:12,494
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point because I don't know to what extent I'll be able to, I probably won't be able to talk about Fire Emblem, which is fine because it's an anime panel anyway.

517
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:13,955
[SPEAKER_06]: The Baldur's Gate 3...

518
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:20,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think Larian is not on a struck list, but I don't know that for sure.

519
00:46:21,037 --> 00:46:23,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So I probably will not know until I get there.

520
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:23,839
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

521
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:36,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if we had to talk about other things, I am sure there are plenty of you out there that would listen to Neil Newborn and all of those voice actors I mentioned read the fucking phone book.

522
00:46:36,784 --> 00:46:37,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

523
00:46:37,584 --> 00:47:03,213
[SPEAKER_05]: so we will find plenty to talk about don't worry Baldur's Gate 3 or otherwise yeah he's fun to watch stream too yeah yeah like he will just bust out into a starry end at a drop of a hat yeah so yeah there was the uh Giancarlo uh Esposito uh the one thing I think of about you know that would be definitely not struck work is when he cameoed on Dropout as part of um

524
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:06,152
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

525
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.

526
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:31,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally would want to know a bit more about mocap work because that's actually a big thing that Neil Newbon does.

527
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:39,795
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got mocap education, resources for voice actors, ways to help professionals in the field.

528
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:46,717
[SPEAKER_03]: He really has done a lot of good work for other actors who happen to be in a virtual field.

529
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:54,490
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you bring up a really good point because a lot of things we call voice actors in gaming today actually has a lot of mocap stuff going on.

530
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And the best example of that I can think of is actually a panel I was lucky enough to do a couple years ago at DragonCon.

531
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:03,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a panel with actors from Red Dead Redemption and the sequel.

532
00:48:03,812 --> 00:48:07,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was funny because in the book, it was called voice actor panel.

533
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:09,214
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we got there and got up on stage, they were like,

534
00:48:09,794 --> 00:48:16,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we're like acting in like a small theater in these mocap things, basically in a room that's like a theater.

535
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:21,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And so actually, I learned a lot about that process from the Red Dead folks.

536
00:48:21,602 --> 00:48:23,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really enlightening to me.

537
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:31,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to say one of them did like a Let's Play of the series with somebody else on YouTube and talks a lot about that.

538
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:32,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh, thank you.

539
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwell says performance actors is what they prefer to be called in that case.

540
00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:48,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I really appreciate, because he also, I mean, he did, great, I can't remember the character, it's in one of the Resident Evils I didn't play, Resident Evil 4.

541
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was in Detroit Become Human.

542
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:54,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

543
00:48:55,596 --> 00:49:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: as Gavin and then as the CEO guy, which honestly, I always thought there was something a little bit off about the accent.

544
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:05,964
[SPEAKER_03]: He does a really decent American accent.

545
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:15,691
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I've followed his career, you know, in voice acting and mocap for a hot minute.

546
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:16,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And

547
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:25,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I have to say is one of my inspirations for getting into some of the projects that I'm doing.

548
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:26,360
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

549
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,761
[SPEAKER_03]: That I can't talk about yet.

550
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:29,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

551
00:49:29,823 --> 00:49:32,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I still am in the planning stages.

552
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:33,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to DragonCon!

553
00:50:01,357 --> 00:50:03,599
[SPEAKER_06]: No show on September the 1st for that reason.

554
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Another chance for me to take over.

555
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:08,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

556
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:10,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my wild way.

557
00:50:11,026 --> 00:50:15,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwell points out we do the annual masquerade party in the VOG Network suite.

558
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:18,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will give a shout out to this.

559
00:50:19,134 --> 00:50:23,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically, I don't know what is and isn't broadcast, but...

560
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,661
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonCon TV is a really cool thing.

561
00:50:27,781 --> 00:50:32,102
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't go to DragonCon, you can still get like a $10 membership for DragonCon TV.

562
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see a selection of a lot of these different types of panels.

563
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:39,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And DragonCon TV is something they actually beam into the hotels.

564
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:42,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So they use the in-house hotel channels.

565
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:46,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're at a host hotel, one of the five host hotels, you can actually watch DragonCon TV.

566
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:52,668
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are too tired and you want to lie in bed, but you want to see one of the big panels, you can actually watch DragonCon TV.

567
00:50:52,828 --> 00:51:15,013
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them are streamed on DragonConTV I don't know if any of mine are I imagine the Baldur's Gate Well, I think they're doing the Baldur's Gate one three times But I imagine one of these might be on DragonConTV So you can actually see that If you can get me the time for that, I'll actually I'll take off work if I have to Oh, I love that, thank you so much And I hope that no one from work is listening to me say that

568
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:17,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try to find out about that.

569
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:22,867
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, DragonCon TV memberships are a way that you could do that and participate virtually, which will be cool.

570
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:42,392
[SPEAKER_06]: But something that Bobby and I do every year is that Sunday night, we will get a group of friends together from DragonCon and have a masquerade party where we watch the masquerade from the comfort of our hotel room eating pizza and just being able to talk relatively as loud as we want amongst friends and watching the masquerade.

571
00:51:42,452 --> 00:51:44,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are certain traditions where

572
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:45,792
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

573
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:19,025
[SPEAKER_06]: The year they did it virtually, they didn't get the streaming rights to be able to stream that cartoon for obvious reasons.

574
00:52:19,605 --> 00:52:26,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So they remade the cartoon with all these people that are at DragonCon all the time.

575
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confident Mark Muir's got to be in there.

576
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:35,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confident Mark Muir and Garrett Wong are almost certainly in this, where they actually just reenacted Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century.

577
00:52:36,777 --> 00:52:38,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fucking great.

578
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:39,278
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't animated.

579
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:41,300
[SPEAKER_06]: It was people wearing costumes.

580
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:43,321
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great.

581
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:47,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the virtual year was really sweet.

582
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:55,170
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole situation was shit, but DragonCon did an amazing job for 2020 because the parade was awesome too.

583
00:52:55,190 --> 00:53:06,638
[SPEAKER_06]: The way they did the parade, they still had people, they recorded people, and they had them walk left to right across the street so that the parade looked like it was always people going by.

584
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:07,119
[SPEAKER_06]: It was...

585
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:10,724
[SPEAKER_06]: They did the best they could with that whole thing.

586
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:13,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Bobby Blackwolf actually links it in chat.

587
00:53:13,285 --> 00:53:20,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to play it now, but check that out if you're in the chat room or you can search it later for the Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century.

588
00:53:20,348 --> 00:53:22,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's get into video game news, though.

589
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not here for Daffy Duck, unfortunately.

590
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,791
[SPEAKER_06]: You're here for video game news.

591
00:53:25,971 --> 00:53:27,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get to it, Loki.

592
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, some more rumors on when that Switch 2 is expected.

593
00:53:34,989 --> 00:53:39,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of figured probably the end of this quarter, or financial year I should say.

594
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:42,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So, March 2025.

595
00:53:43,355 --> 00:53:50,661
[SPEAKER_05]: However, apparently some developers are expressing that they expect it to be launching next financial year.

596
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:57,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometime between, you know, after March 2025.

597
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe early April, maybe May.

598
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

599
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo plays by their own set of rules.

600
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:08,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, apparently this has been confirmed as well by UniruGamer.

601
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:16,430
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they can corroborate this as well with April 2025 being the very earliest the console could arrive now.

602
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:21,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll just wait and see until they announce it officially.

603
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:25,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just keep fucking waiting for that Nintendo successor because I...

604
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:36,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I'm on the fence here because I'm like, if they are delaying it to make sure they have enough parts to make enough of them to meet the demand, it's hard for me to be upset.

605
00:54:36,453 --> 00:54:43,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure it is not a pain in the fucking ass to get one of these when they come out, like most Nintendo hardware usually is when it comes out.

606
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:50,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not have to want to sit there humping the Target app, refreshing inventory at my local stores to get a fucking Switch 2.

607
00:54:50,823 --> 00:54:51,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be able to just...

608
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:52,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Get one.

609
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:55,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, order it on Amazon, have it show up at my house.

610
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:58,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Or pre-order it at Best Buy, go walk to the store and get it.

611
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:02,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it should be that easy, I hope.

612
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:04,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that's the reason for the delay, fine.

613
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:13,135
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, it's like, the Switch is not getting any younger, and it is getting harder and harder to tolerate games on it, let me tell you.

614
00:55:14,155 --> 00:55:15,556
[SPEAKER_06]: It's falling behind big time.

615
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:17,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.

616
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:25,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just wondering what we'll see as far as announcements for more games because it's kind of not really anything else coming out.

617
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:33,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised if they just try to push it into that maybe for whatever reason they're going to hit their target numbers in this financial year.

618
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:37,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're like, okay, we'll just pad out the next one or something like that.

619
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:41,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the reasoning for it would be, but...

620
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:45,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it doesn't matter.

621
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:52,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's delayed to 2026 or something like that, which I don't think it would be.

622
00:55:52,805 --> 00:55:53,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't matter.

623
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:00,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's either coming end of May or in June.

624
00:56:00,605 --> 00:56:07,369
[SPEAKER_06]: July seems late, but then again, I'm all for Nintendo waiting as long as possible and making sure enough units are made so the scalpers can't get them.

625
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:18,875
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, considering all this information we have about when it is coming and when it isn't coming, I think that Memorial Day weekend, which you're kind of highlighting there, May or June, I think that Memorial Day weekend sort of period is a good bet.

626
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:19,655
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

627
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:20,416
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

628
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:52,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Quest Buster in chat says, Tears of the Kingdom really laid bare how far it pushed the Switch.

629
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:53,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.

630
00:56:54,534 --> 00:57:00,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing Pokemon Scarlet recently and I know tons of you have played it as well and you know, it's rough.

631
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:07,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really feels like you're playing the low-end specs version of a Switch that never was, but we'll see.

632
00:57:07,947 --> 00:57:12,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just hope that the new one, though, has the specs to keep up with this stuff because if it's just like...

633
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:35,112
[SPEAKER_06]: well it doesn't run as bad you know then that could be I would think that the dev kits would match that and so hopefully a lot of that will get worked out I mean you know the Pokemon company doesn't always make the best optimized games but like I have got to have a new switch for Pokemon Legends ZA I've got to have a new switch for Pokemon Legends ZA by the way

634
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:36,901
[SPEAKER_06]: The PokeMedia

635
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,803
[SPEAKER_06]: While we await... Oh, closing ceremonies are in an hour or so.

636
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,625
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we might still be live when that all happens, so we'll see.

637
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:02,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, it'll be right after we go off air tonight.

638
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:07,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's follow back on something we were talking about last week.

639
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:18,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had some late-breaking news during the show last week that Tango Gameworks was being absorbed by a new publisher, Krafton, who, of course, made...

640
00:58:18,959 --> 00:58:20,520
[SPEAKER_06]: PUBG, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

641
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was happy news because we didn't want to see Tango go away.

642
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:27,343
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't want to see Hi-Fi Rush go away.

643
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:29,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is very happy news.

644
00:58:29,084 --> 00:58:31,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also begged the question, well, wait a minute.

645
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:34,116
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

646
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching.

647
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:51,556
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next time.

648
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:32,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So folks are thinking this is probably the half that didn't yet find new employment or just pieced out of the industry or for whatever reason otherwise decided they were not going to continue the journey.

649
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:34,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like we have some clarity now.

650
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:38,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about half of who was working at Tango before is going to carry on with this.

651
00:59:38,925 --> 01:00:06,064
[SPEAKER_06]: but that could still be an interesting kind of mix of like the people that made the game before and knew what made it great and maybe some new folks that come in from Krafton's side that helped to innovate with some new ideas that could be very interesting I mean obviously it would have been better if we didn't have the layoffs in the first place but I'm trying to find the silver lining in this you know maybe kind of mixing together a little bit there will cause some cool new ideas for Hi-Fi Rush 2 which seems at this point inevitable we will get that game it's just a matter of when

652
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:08,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was an interesting follow-up.

653
01:00:08,445 --> 01:00:10,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a little question answered that we had last week.

654
01:00:11,628 --> 01:00:14,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, DarkSakura has some news on the flip side of the coin, right?

655
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:20,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was also just reading back to Krafton that they got this big funding deal too.

656
01:00:21,776 --> 01:00:25,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're actually looking to be in really good shape.

657
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:27,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it's good for them.

658
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:34,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, obviously very, very happy with this ending, even if it would have been nicer to be a little sooner before Microsoft did what they did, but.

659
01:00:35,037 --> 01:00:38,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But in that not-so-good news, this is about Ubisoft.

660
01:00:38,899 --> 01:00:50,426
[SPEAKER_03]: They are doing another round of layoffs in San Francisco and Cary Studios that was also better known as Red Storm Entertainment.

661
01:00:51,187 --> 01:00:53,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the second round of layoffs.

662
01:00:54,268 --> 01:01:01,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing off 45 people between those two groups.

663
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,633
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually happened on the 16th.

664
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,855
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a big breakdown out as far as I can tell.

665
01:01:07,655 --> 01:01:16,619
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, they were dealing with canceled games with Red Storm, like Division Heartland.

666
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:20,900
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd also worked on Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.

667
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what happens.

668
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:31,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's 45 more people who have to look for jobs in an already diminishing...

669
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Field.

670
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:37,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, Yves Guimond, CEO of Ubisoft, still has a job.

671
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:41,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of us are sitting here and hearing this news wondering why.

672
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:49,543
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have to say as well.

673
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:50,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually kind of curious.

674
01:01:50,763 --> 01:01:52,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, hmm, let's see.

675
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:58,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at a story from, let's see, what is this here we're looking at?

676
01:01:58,887 --> 01:02:04,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this was published last month in an article on Gamefile.

677
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:07,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this might be a, is this the actual site?

678
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

679
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:14,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at a site called Gamefile.news, but I think it might be one of those third-party things that's pushing another article.

680
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:16,990
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was from a Google search, so I just took what came up.

681
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:28,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But it actually mentions that the pay for the past year ended up being $2 million in cash and stock for Yves Guimond.

682
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:29,459
[SPEAKER_06]: $2 million.

683
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:36,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually not as much as I thought it would be, but that's still way too much money for somebody who's hemorrhaging employees like that.

684
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:46,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, first of all, no one needs that kind of income, maybe unless they live in a very expensive city, maybe.

685
01:02:47,754 --> 01:02:49,516
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a whole other, you know,

686
01:02:53,342 --> 01:03:14,298
[SPEAKER_03]: the big thing is that if your company is failing the primary responsibility is going to fall on the person that runs the company being the CEO and if the CEO is unwilling to make sacrifices then the board needs to step in and do something

687
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:27,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I will point out before it's pointed out to me in chat or email that Ysgaon did take a 30% pay cut a couple of years ago, but I think we can all agree, Satoru Iwata, you are not, sir.

688
01:03:29,236 --> 01:03:29,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

689
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no one is Iwata.

690
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:31,819
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

691
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:32,860
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

692
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:34,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

693
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:34,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

694
01:03:35,475 --> 01:04:02,770
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so I guess this is not super surprising but there was a highly anticipated Modern Warfare 2 remaster multiplayer mod because when that game was released they didn't include the multiplayer portion of it and this would have modified Modern Warfare 1 to basically have some of the maps from Modern Warfare 2 or like remaster those

695
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:23,380
[SPEAKER_05]: and as you would expect cease and desist of course someone did their job for them one day before it was supposed to be released so what happens well that's too bad hope it doesn't leak on the internet that would be tragic if it did

696
01:04:25,603 --> 01:04:51,133
[SPEAKER_05]: and then in somewhat better news Call of Duty is Activision is changing how Call of Duty is going to be available to download because one of the things that kind of is associated with Call of Duty recently over the last few years is it's enormously stupidly large download size right now the current size of the game is 175 gigabytes which is

697
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge.

698
01:04:55,162 --> 01:05:01,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're going to allow you to essentially split up that download to the parts that you would play.

699
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:12,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, the single player campaign, if you're just going to be playing the online Warzone stuff, multiplayer, whatever the case may be.

700
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:22,124
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have a launcher that will allow you to access the different modes and then delete the rest later on if you need to.

701
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:28,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the bare minimum they could have done, at least.

702
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:30,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, thanks.

703
01:05:31,572 --> 01:05:39,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's that scene from Sailor Moon where Tuxedo Common says, my job is done, and she's like, but you didn't do anything.

704
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:39,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

705
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:43,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't he, Lisa?

706
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:43,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't he?

707
01:05:44,755 --> 01:05:49,840
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100Matt says, Oh, so you can only use up to half your data cap and not all of it downloading the whole game.

708
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

709
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:51,102
[SPEAKER_06]: That part.

710
01:05:51,742 --> 01:05:55,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dumb.

711
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:57,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

712
01:05:57,628 --> 01:06:03,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I haven't been engaged in Modern Warfare or that type of stuff in a while, so...

713
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:07,059
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's Undivided Attention Dragon Age Yeah

714
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:33,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say it worked.

715
01:06:34,025 --> 01:06:34,326
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

716
01:06:34,806 --> 01:06:45,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about specifically Dragon Age Veilguard, which is, of course, the latest entry in Dragon Age that we have been waiting a long, long, long time for.

717
01:06:45,518 --> 01:06:48,722
[SPEAKER_03]: A Steam pre-order is already published, by the way.

718
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, well now we know exactly when the wait will end.

719
01:06:52,456 --> 01:06:53,857
[SPEAKER_06]: We finally have a release date.

720
01:06:54,137 --> 01:07:01,160
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an official release date trailer that showed up this week, if you're into the super cuts of cutscenes and a little bit of gameplay in there and that stuff.

721
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But we know the day for Dragon Age The Veil Guard is October 31st.

722
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:07,823
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, happy Halloween from Bioware.

723
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: The Veil Guard will be out on October 31st.

724
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:15,487
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first game in the Dragon Age series in, get this, 10 years.

725
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

726
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:21,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Inquisition can almost be a classic game of the week.

727
01:07:21,411 --> 01:07:25,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to get to the fall, but we are almost at the point where Dragon Age Inquisition could be a classic game of the week.

728
01:07:25,915 --> 01:07:26,676
[SPEAKER_00]: You are correct.

729
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:28,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked.

730
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:33,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So this game has been 10 years in the making, but I will say I've

731
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:34,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a fan of everything.

732
01:07:34,743 --> 01:07:37,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not even the Dragon Age fan that DarkSakura is.

733
01:07:37,824 --> 01:07:40,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it, but I'm not super into it.

734
01:07:41,787 --> 01:07:44,128
[SPEAKER_06]: But even I was looking at the gameplay trailers and stuff.

735
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:45,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay, that looks pretty rad.

736
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:47,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to check this game out for sure.

737
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

738
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:52,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know that the Inquisitor is going to end up back in it.

739
01:07:52,352 --> 01:07:56,394
[SPEAKER_03]: They've pretty much spoiled it for everybody already because they've had a bunch of...

740
01:07:57,655 --> 01:07:58,375
[SPEAKER_03]: articles go out.

741
01:07:58,395 --> 01:08:09,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing also like a video a day kind of thing for a little bit with information and I'm honestly looking forward to a lot of these new characters.

742
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the designs are absolutely amazing.

743
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:15,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus it's set in Tevinter which I expect there to be a lot of fabulousness.

744
01:08:17,787 --> 01:08:45,452
[SPEAKER_06]: also to point out just something that we've learned about the game there will be a diverse array of accessibility options including standard difficulty modes so I'm not sure if we can tone it all the way down to a Bobby Blackwolf mode so he can play the game but I don't know exactly how much we can tweak the game but it sounds like we'll be able to make the game easier or harder if that's something you're into and then custom settings to make different aspects of the game more forgiving

745
01:08:46,112 --> 01:09:12,903
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting so i wonder if you i wonder if you could just like turn off death or something and sometimes there's that sometimes it goes that far so uh we'll see we'll know more soon i'm expecting different things like switch control one arm controls you know that type of thing of course of course um colorblind modes um i mean there's all sorts of things and um i would even say descriptive modes yeah yeah i was thinking that too like last of us had yeah

746
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:34,725
[SPEAKER_03]: and honestly more games need descriptive modes like that too it's like I mean it's something I've been doing if anyone is in like a stream of mine and expresses that they've got visual difficulties I try to be really descriptive it's not that hard to do you hire someone to narrate the scenery plus like

747
01:09:35,436 --> 01:09:49,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was talking about, I thought you were talking about streaming because in streaming, it kind of gives you something to talk about if you're not like the type that is very good at keeping, or you don't have a busy, busy chat or you're just, you know, you're, you don't, you're still working on your interaction and doing that.

748
01:09:49,803 --> 01:09:53,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Like being descriptive is a really good way to kind of fill space and be helpful.

749
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:54,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.

750
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:54,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

751
01:09:54,426 --> 01:10:04,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me though, the being descriptive has been a really good exercise for me working on my, my novel.

752
01:10:04,751 --> 01:10:31,697
[SPEAKER_03]: hmm um that I'm finally starting to get underway is this what what do they fucking call that when they do November write a book in November the national writing yes yeah but I'm not doing it for that okay okay um I've I've been putting a lot of work into this I guess I'll talk a little bit about it um I'm doing them as serials hmm

753
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, sort of episodic.

754
01:10:35,282 --> 01:10:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So the stories will be affordable and, you know, you have something to look forward to and then to be released as a full novel later on.

755
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:48,330
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my plan.

756
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:52,352
[SPEAKER_03]: With game sort of content to follow.

757
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:58,816
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a really ambitious project and it is on the back burner, but underway.

758
01:10:58,836 --> 01:10:59,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it that way.

759
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:01,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it here first.

760
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:04,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

761
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:06,465
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you actually have our next story.

762
01:11:07,525 --> 01:11:08,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I do indeed.

763
01:11:09,126 --> 01:11:12,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Silent Hill Ascension.

764
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:17,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, what a weird thing that was.

765
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:24,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It won the Creative Arts Emmy Award.

766
01:11:25,626 --> 01:11:28,347
[SPEAKER_03]: for its existence.

767
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Genvid CEO, Jacob Novak, said that just needed to put out thank yous for the team.

768
01:11:38,092 --> 01:11:42,774
[SPEAKER_03]: 300 writers, artists, developers, QA testers, mocap performers, voice actors, and localization editors.

769
01:11:43,294 --> 01:11:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for Konami, Bad Robot.

770
01:11:46,576 --> 01:11:51,158
[SPEAKER_03]: They listed Behavior, Sinscape, Streamline, Google, and Eclipse Games.

771
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:52,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

772
01:11:54,238 --> 01:12:03,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's cool we're definitely seeing more gaming and gaming franchises getting really big acclaim

773
01:12:04,758 --> 01:12:06,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this is interesting to me.

774
01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:13,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, it's cool that it got an Emmy and probably like what they were trying to do is very unlike, you know, something we've seen.

775
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,741
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the most part, it did not get received well.

776
01:12:16,881 --> 01:12:17,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the thing.

777
01:12:18,562 --> 01:12:21,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this very interesting sort of duality here.

778
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:23,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Creativity, though.

779
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:23,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

780
01:12:24,243 --> 01:12:24,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

781
01:12:24,643 --> 01:12:29,065
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like the way of which it was delivered to the medium and the media.

782
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of Silent Hill fans didn't care for it.

783
01:12:32,966 --> 01:12:33,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

784
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:40,891
[SPEAKER_06]: If that could get an Emmy, then... Maybe you think the Borderlands motion picture could win an Oscar?

785
01:12:42,372 --> 01:12:42,572
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

786
01:12:43,573 --> 01:12:55,422
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, when you think about it, you can have a movie that has really... Well, you can practically have anything that has really great concepts, really good...

787
01:12:58,697 --> 01:13:00,439
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the word I'm thinking of?

788
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:04,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing innovations in how it's produced and how it's created.

789
01:13:05,086 --> 01:13:08,311
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can still come out as a piece of crap.

790
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:09,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just like...

791
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:13,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of examples.

792
01:13:13,913 --> 01:13:14,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an example.

793
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:17,817
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the Wachowski sisters when they did the Speed Racer movie?

794
01:13:17,857 --> 01:13:20,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some people love that movie, but some people think it's... I love that movie.

795
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are not fans.

796
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:29,049
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it didn't win, it was nominated for an Oscar for costumes and visual effects.

797
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, no.

798
01:13:31,772 --> 01:13:33,554
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of just...

799
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:42,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it this way, because you know me, I like myself some not great movies if it's got an interesting concept.

800
01:13:45,575 --> 01:13:56,105
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I think, more of the thing that you can recognize when a product does not come out as expected, but still displays a great deal of innovation.

801
01:13:57,006 --> 01:13:59,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the Betamax.

802
01:14:00,919 --> 01:14:01,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Great idea!

803
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:05,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it was far superior to VHS, but what went out in the end?

804
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:06,524
[SPEAKER_03]: VHS.

805
01:14:06,865 --> 01:14:07,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

806
01:14:07,705 --> 01:14:09,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Because VHS had the adult film industry.

807
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:12,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Blu-ray versus HD, you know, DVD.

808
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:13,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

809
01:14:14,612 --> 01:14:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: You know... Because Blu-ray was built into the PlayStation 3.

810
01:14:18,095 --> 01:14:18,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

811
01:14:20,638 --> 01:14:22,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know... Oh, here's an example.

812
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,360
[SPEAKER_01]: The Virtual Boy.

813
01:14:24,802 --> 01:14:24,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

814
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

815
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:30,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It really did do a lot of innovation for what it was.

816
01:14:30,893 --> 01:14:31,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It was new.

817
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:32,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It was novel.

818
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:37,978
[SPEAKER_03]: People were excited about it, even if, again, it wasn't the best thing in the world.

819
01:14:38,338 --> 01:14:40,019
[SPEAKER_03]: As I call it, the great red migraine machine.

820
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:55,600
[SPEAKER_03]: but it definitely was innovation for what it did it was something new and really you know created this new range of possibility for for entertainment okay that's a good that's a good analogy

821
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, this is a very random question.

822
01:14:58,581 --> 01:14:59,581
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I have to ask it.

823
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, I talked about the Speed Racer movie.

824
01:15:01,482 --> 01:15:04,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, Loki's like, I like that movie.

825
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:04,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that movie.

826
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:07,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf said Speed Racer is amazing.

827
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:12,486
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always my answer to my favorite movie that everyone else hates.

828
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:19,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'm going to ask you, and I know DarkSakura, I know DarkSakura is beyond a shadow of a doubt, but I'm gonna see if I'm right.

829
01:15:19,688 --> 01:15:21,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like write it on a piece of paper or something if I had it.

830
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is your favorite movie that everyone else hates?

831
01:15:26,877 --> 01:15:29,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say Xanadu, but now a lot of people love it.

832
01:15:29,818 --> 01:15:31,218
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been my answer was Xanadu.

833
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:34,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say Cube 2 Hypercube.

834
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that tracks.

835
01:15:38,141 --> 01:15:38,581
[SPEAKER_06]: That tracks.

836
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, because great concept, you know, but poor execution.

837
01:15:46,063 --> 01:15:47,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still find it enjoyable.

838
01:15:47,603 --> 01:15:51,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would also throw out an honorable mention of Robot Jocks.

839
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:52,485
Yeah.

840
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, and I liked Alien Resurrection.

841
01:16:00,378 --> 01:16:07,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Alien Resurrection as well, which is funny because I don't see a lot of Alien movies, and no, I'm not going to go see the new one, but I did see Alien Resurrection.

842
01:16:07,684 --> 01:16:08,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

843
01:16:08,104 --> 01:16:08,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to go with me?

844
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:10,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki does.

845
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:18,833
[SPEAKER_06]: My answer, I think will be obvious too, my answer to this question, a movie I love that everybody else hates, Showgirls.

846
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:31,564
[SPEAKER_06]: but like DarkSakura, I feel like Showgirls is one of those things where especially in the queer community, it's one of those things that people appreciate its badness now.

847
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:41,150
[SPEAKER_06]: People are convinced that Gina Gershon absolutely knew what the fuck was going on with that movie from the very beginning and was acting exactly right.

848
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:46,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Her performance was actually 4D chess in that game and I would believe it because Gina Gershon's amazing.

849
01:16:47,915 --> 01:16:49,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Showgirls is my favorite movie there.

850
01:16:49,816 --> 01:16:51,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyone who doesn't like it, well, they don't know shit.

851
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:52,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't know shit.

852
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go eat some puppy chow.

853
01:16:57,398 --> 01:17:00,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think if I can even think of another one.

854
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:01,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a movie I love that everybody else hates.

855
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I love the movie Sister Act.

856
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:07,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I could watch that every day for the rest of my life.

857
01:17:07,362 --> 01:17:09,022
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people love that movie, right?

858
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:11,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though maybe it wasn't like a critical darling.

859
01:17:12,643 --> 01:17:12,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

860
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:15,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it would be Goldberg.

861
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:16,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I thought of Star Trek.

862
01:17:17,995 --> 01:17:19,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Generations.

863
01:17:19,516 --> 01:17:20,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that movie.

864
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:22,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck if people say it's one of the bad ones.

865
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:31,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I have concepts in it that I like, but I also... You know what we were watching before the show, before Dan left the house?

866
01:17:31,584 --> 01:17:32,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We were watching Wrath of Khan.

867
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:35,386
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.

868
01:17:35,406 --> 01:17:38,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do, for the record, like The Search for Spock.

869
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:44,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also going to throw that out there, that I did enjoy that movie, even with it being fucking bizarre.

870
01:17:45,653 --> 01:17:45,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

871
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to say that right now.

872
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get to Loki's answer in a minute.

873
01:17:51,575 --> 01:17:52,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like Silent Hill.

874
01:17:53,656 --> 01:17:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's true.

875
01:17:54,897 --> 01:17:56,097
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people didn't care for that movie.

876
01:17:56,157 --> 01:17:56,558
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

877
01:17:56,618 --> 01:17:56,858
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

878
01:17:56,878 --> 01:17:57,218
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.

879
01:17:57,238 --> 01:17:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are wrong.

880
01:17:59,499 --> 01:18:02,621
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S is cheering me on in chat saying, hell yeah, Sister Act.

881
01:18:02,681 --> 01:18:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that movie too.

882
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:05,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I got your six.

883
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:06,123
[SPEAKER_06]: True story.

884
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:07,063
[SPEAKER_06]: True story.

885
01:18:07,924 --> 01:18:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my friends, and y'all might know my friend VG Realness or Delvin was on a show called Video Game Realness.

886
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:14,047
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a lot of fun.

887
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:14,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

888
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:14,848
[SPEAKER_06]: He's great.

889
01:18:14,888 --> 01:18:19,110
[SPEAKER_06]: He came out here to Sacramento to visit for, it was a few years ago.

890
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It was before the Panini.

891
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pictures from that.

892
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:22,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a few years ago.

893
01:18:22,412 --> 01:18:26,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we got to meet and hang out with different people, but he wanted to go to Reno.

894
01:18:26,837 --> 01:18:29,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, Delvin, nobody wants to go to Reno.

895
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:32,324
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think it's Vegas, it's not.

896
01:18:32,384 --> 01:18:35,547
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, no, I want to see the places from Sister Act.

897
01:18:36,488 --> 01:18:38,789
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was like, oh, okay.

898
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:39,749
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going.

899
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:43,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a picture with the arch and I was like, that used to be the Fitzgerald.

900
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:50,411
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where they filmed a lot of it, but it's now a rock climbing slash condominium thing because Fitzgerald's closed years ago.

901
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:55,672
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's taken me to see all the sites of where they shot the movie Sister Act in Reno.

902
01:18:55,912 --> 01:18:56,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

903
01:18:58,613 --> 01:18:58,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Ugh.

904
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ranma, if you ever come out here, I'll take you to Reno as well Reno!

905
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:22,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gamora Alright You know what, okay, so Dan's job took him to Reno quite a bit I mean, it's not going to do it so much anymore But there, we used to stay at the Peppermill And they have a pretty freaking decent set of pinball tables there

906
01:19:23,453 --> 01:19:24,114
[SPEAKER_06]: The Peppermill.

907
01:19:24,214 --> 01:19:24,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:27,997
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to have a badass retro arcade there, actually.

909
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:29,618
[SPEAKER_03]: They still have a pretty decent arcade.

910
01:19:29,658 --> 01:19:35,322
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, like, redemption crap there, but for the most part, it's still pretty good.

911
01:19:35,382 --> 01:19:37,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I played, like, Star Wars pods there, too.

912
01:19:37,284 --> 01:19:38,165
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

913
01:19:38,325 --> 01:19:42,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, yeah, just, it's a nice little arcade.

914
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:43,669
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

915
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf totally derailed our show tonight.

916
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:47,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

917
01:19:47,592 --> 01:19:47,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

918
01:19:48,112 --> 01:19:48,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Of all people.

919
01:19:48,933 --> 01:19:49,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Of all people.

920
01:19:49,553 --> 01:19:50,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

921
01:19:50,354 --> 01:19:51,255
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even food.

922
01:19:51,475 --> 01:19:52,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Et tu, Brute?

923
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:52,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

924
01:19:54,811 --> 01:19:55,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Derailed the show.

925
01:19:56,712 --> 01:20:01,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what is your favorite movie that everybody else hates?

926
01:20:01,816 --> 01:20:03,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

927
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:04,799
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

928
01:20:04,839 --> 01:20:06,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's Kung Pao Enter the Fist.

929
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:07,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

930
01:20:08,302 --> 01:20:09,363
[SPEAKER_06]: The skateboarding movie.

931
01:20:10,922 --> 01:20:11,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Gleaming the Cube?

932
01:20:12,464 --> 01:20:25,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, Gleaming the Cube's alright I would say I'm not a huge fan of Gleaming the Cube I've watched that, but like Rad, obviously is one Rad is awesome That's it, Rad was what I was thinking of Didn't you take your kids...

933
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,170
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Prayer of the Rollerboys.

934
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:31,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I normally think of Airborne.

935
01:20:31,871 --> 01:20:35,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Airborne is a bad movie that I used to love watching.

936
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:37,054
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also rollerblading.

937
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:42,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But then more recently, Turbo Kid, for sure.

938
01:20:42,457 --> 01:20:47,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And then kind of a throwback one that I watched once, but I would watch again.

939
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:48,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Wanted.

940
01:20:49,941 --> 01:20:51,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta curb those bullets.

941
01:20:51,642 --> 01:20:51,882
Yeah.

942
01:20:53,457 --> 01:20:55,098
[SPEAKER_06]: That movie was so stupid.

943
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I have ever seen that.

944
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, it's a Marvel comic.

945
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:00,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that.

946
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I do like the old Punisher movie.

947
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:05,628
[SPEAKER_03]: The one with Dolph Lundgren.

948
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:08,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And Masters of the Universe.

949
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:24,794
[SPEAKER_06]: was one of the one where the guy took the keyboard and smacked the other guy and then all the keys pop off and say fuck you was that that movie yes that's wanted okay that was that movie was ridiculous I would say like yeah well it's not a bad movie but like you know Commando I mean

950
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love Commando.

951
01:21:27,228 --> 01:21:27,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Stopping.

952
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:28,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

953
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:29,749
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

954
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:42,453
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get back into gaming news, but I have one more answer that nobody said that I know applies to all of us and all of you in chat, unless you've never seen it, which is certainly possible.

955
01:21:42,513 --> 01:21:49,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think y'all should go check it out if you haven't and see what you think of the movie from the 1980s, The Wizard with Fred Savage.

956
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:50,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah!

957
01:21:51,158 --> 01:21:51,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the wizard.

958
01:21:52,178 --> 01:21:53,399
[SPEAKER_01]: The wizard is so cute.

959
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:55,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Critics hated that fucking movie.

960
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

961
01:21:57,201 --> 01:21:58,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Critics are full of shit.

962
01:21:58,682 --> 01:22:00,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf points out the Super Mario Bros.

963
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:02,004
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 Nintendo Direct.

964
01:22:02,324 --> 01:22:05,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, and I think the chat is saying, alright, I bitch, you got me.

965
01:22:05,906 --> 01:22:06,366
[SPEAKER_06]: You got me.

966
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:08,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Roberts wins.

967
01:22:08,687 --> 01:22:09,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Roberts won.

968
01:22:10,288 --> 01:22:10,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Scores 1.

969
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

970
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: There were so many good movies though in the 80s and 90s and stuff like that.

971
01:22:16,475 --> 01:22:17,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

972
01:22:17,155 --> 01:22:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what other movie I saw like 40 times on VHS?

973
01:22:20,179 --> 01:22:21,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3.

974
01:22:22,721 --> 01:22:24,163
[SPEAKER_06]: The one where they time travel.

975
01:22:24,784 --> 01:22:25,344
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

976
01:22:25,544 --> 01:22:25,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

977
01:22:26,065 --> 01:22:27,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that in the theater four times.

978
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that

979
01:22:30,636 --> 01:22:37,145
[SPEAKER_03]: True story, the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles started my thing of seeing movies that I super love in the theater in multiples of twos and fours.

980
01:22:37,946 --> 01:22:39,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started on it.

981
01:22:39,528 --> 01:22:40,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be an autism thing, I don't know.

982
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:46,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But I saw all three of them in the theater four times each.

983
01:22:46,929 --> 01:23:16,134
[SPEAKER_05]: and yes the only reason I thought of Ninja Turtles is because Tiger Claw's name popped up in chat and I was like oh the Ninja Turtles movie if you haven't watched it yet if you haven't watched it yet the new animated one that came out last summer I think fantastic like it's such a good movie I haven't seen it but you're not the first person I've heard say that it like it just it just feels right like I don't know what to say but like they are I think supposed to be doing another one so hopefully we'll see that it had like some

984
01:23:17,941 --> 01:23:32,578
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome association added to it like unhinged or something it's like something Mutant Mayhem that was it, that was really good that was really good

985
01:23:33,857 --> 01:23:34,277
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

986
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:35,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Back into gaming news.

987
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:40,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw won and got his Ninja Turtles tangent.

988
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:43,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's... And somehow Bobby Blackwolf enabled it.

989
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a wild night here at VOG Network.

990
01:23:46,946 --> 01:23:47,287
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

991
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:50,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to... Honestly, it's a night of honesty.

992
01:23:50,729 --> 01:23:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

993
01:23:51,269 --> 01:23:52,070
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a night of honesty.

994
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:52,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a night of honesty.

995
01:23:53,151 --> 01:23:53,631
All right.

996
01:23:54,772 --> 01:23:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to this.

997
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:59,415
[SPEAKER_06]: This is honestly what the fuck.

998
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:03,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, this next story is honestly what the fuck.

999
01:24:04,195 --> 01:24:14,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this, I think we can categorize it as franchises that are circling the drain that are just trying anything to, like, stay relevant.

1000
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Like, where did that shark come from?

1001
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:24,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Charles E. Cheese, um, is... Oh, we're using the legal name!

1002
01:24:25,484 --> 01:24:27,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Esquire, the, uh...

1003
01:24:29,706 --> 01:24:32,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Charles Cheese.

1004
01:24:32,507 --> 01:24:36,927
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like when your mom says your full fucking name because you know you were busted.

1005
01:24:37,307 --> 01:24:49,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't forget about his French cousin, you know, Charles de Fromage.

1006
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:52,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Charles Esquire Cheese, you get your ass down here right now!

1007
01:24:54,771 --> 01:24:56,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he the new member of Wild Stallions?

1008
01:25:01,286 --> 01:25:07,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So what obviously could possibly not be, there's no way it could be a scam with the name Fun Pass.

1009
01:25:08,913 --> 01:25:14,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a Fun Pass because it's fun to pay monthly fees to go to an arcade.

1010
01:25:15,139 --> 01:25:17,661
[SPEAKER_05]: They have three tiers because of course they do.

1011
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:18,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't they?

1012
01:25:18,642 --> 01:25:19,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're causing tiers.

1013
01:25:20,693 --> 01:25:25,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the bronze tier, which no one cares about because it's bronze.

1014
01:25:25,896 --> 01:25:27,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's like third place.

1015
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:28,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants that?

1016
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $8 a month, gets you 40 free arcade games.

1017
01:25:33,139 --> 01:25:35,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Free, even though you paid for them, but yeah, sure, whatever.

1018
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Discounts off of pizza, 20% off pizza.

1019
01:25:39,442 --> 01:25:43,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki, I'm losing... For pizza that's only 20% good?

1020
01:25:43,643 --> 01:25:46,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm losing my fucking mind at this comment in chat.

1021
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:50,409
[SPEAKER_06]: The SGM100 Matt said, Buka to Chucky.

1022
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:52,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Buka to Chucky.

1023
01:25:57,287 --> 01:25:58,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have that.

1024
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:00,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you get like 40 arcade games and discounts or whatever.

1025
01:26:01,129 --> 01:26:05,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, they also have other passes.

1026
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:15,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So the top end is the gold pass for $30 a month for 250 free games, 50% off other purchases as well.

1027
01:26:17,378 --> 01:26:21,900
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be really going to Chuck E. Cheese a lot, I would think, to do this.

1028
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:26,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once again, the whole point of doing this in the first place would be to just...

1029
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:32,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Get you kind of hooked in in the sense that, well, I'm paying for this, I gotta go, and then you spend more money.

1030
01:26:33,132 --> 01:26:34,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Chuck E. Cheese doesn't even have DDR.

1031
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:42,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if Round 1 did this, like, fuck it, I know people would sign up for that, but Charles doesn't even have DDR.

1032
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:47,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

1033
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:48,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1034
01:26:49,756 --> 01:26:50,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

1035
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want it.

1036
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:53,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Better games.

1037
01:26:54,177 --> 01:26:55,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Get some DDR in there.

1038
01:26:57,145 --> 01:27:21,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you know what, more power to those that want to go, but yeah Oh, oh, oh, hold on, and then the best part about it Chuck E. Cheese monthly memberships may be cancelled any time after the first 12 months They lock you in for 12 months, like it's some sort of cable Like a fucking cable Like it's a gym membership, it's the worst type Gym membership or something like that

1039
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the unhealthiest gym membership ever.

1040
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:26,161
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1041
01:27:49,352 --> 01:27:51,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know what he's talking about, the lawsuit.

1042
01:27:51,633 --> 01:28:05,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody is suing a Disney park for a wrongful death lawsuit, but Disney is saying that it has to be arbitrated because by signing up for Disney+, they willed all of their arbitration rights to Disney.

1043
01:28:06,758 --> 01:28:07,098
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1044
01:28:07,498 --> 01:28:07,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1045
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:08,839
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I shit you not.

1046
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:09,799
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a thing.

1047
01:28:09,879 --> 01:28:10,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a wrongful death.

1048
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:14,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Like somebody... Was it that he died at a theme park or on a cruise or something?

1049
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was a theme park.

1050
01:28:15,181 --> 01:28:23,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was in Walt Disney World and they went to a place that advertised itself as... Oh, that's right.

1051
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:23,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a restaurant.

1052
01:28:23,643 --> 01:28:24,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a food allergy.

1053
01:28:24,704 --> 01:28:25,164
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1054
01:28:25,184 --> 01:28:26,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a food allergy.

1055
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:30,285
[SPEAKER_05]: They were basically advertised that they could cater to people with food allergies.

1056
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:30,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1057
01:28:30,726 --> 01:28:34,747
[SPEAKER_05]: They asked many times while ordering and while receiving the food...

1058
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:38,930
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you did take care of this so there's no food allergy stuff.

1059
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to have a problem.

1060
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:45,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And for legal reasons, I'm going to say this is all allegedly because I'm not fucking with Disney.

1061
01:28:45,354 --> 01:28:46,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not fucking with Disney.

1062
01:28:47,075 --> 01:28:50,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so allegedly that all happened and then she died.

1063
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:58,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so now they're saying, oh, well, because the husband purchased a trial to or... No, it was a trial.

1064
01:28:58,223 --> 01:29:00,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in chat is saying it was even a trial.

1065
01:29:00,325 --> 01:29:01,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't even a thing.

1066
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:01,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1067
01:29:01,966 --> 01:29:04,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's just it's ridiculous.

1068
01:29:04,468 --> 01:29:11,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Bobby Blackwell says this is reported by this is like a CNN story and like, you know, news outlets that this is not like a fucking TMZ thing.

1069
01:29:11,974 --> 01:29:13,755
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like legitimately being reported.

1070
01:29:14,295 --> 01:29:17,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you like how I say it's not TMZ?

1071
01:29:17,177 --> 01:29:18,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually legitimate.

1072
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:20,400
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1073
01:29:21,584 --> 01:29:22,325
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1074
01:29:43,272 --> 01:29:44,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I stopped.

1075
01:29:44,313 --> 01:29:46,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I do know why I stopped Anstream.

1076
01:29:46,175 --> 01:29:47,236
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why I stopped Anstream?

1077
01:29:47,577 --> 01:29:54,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it worked on the Xbox One, but for the longest time it didn't work on the Series X. And I thought that was the silliest thing.

1078
01:29:54,705 --> 01:29:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to play Anstream on my console and it wouldn't work on my current console, so I got rid of it.

1079
01:29:59,290 --> 01:29:59,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1080
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:03,935
[SPEAKER_06]: and Stream has announced they're going to be coming out on PlayStation consoles now.

1081
01:30:04,076 --> 01:30:04,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally.

1082
01:30:04,676 --> 01:30:05,998
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really overdue, y'all.

1083
01:30:06,378 --> 01:30:07,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm glad it's happening.

1084
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And Stream is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1085
01:30:10,663 --> 01:30:16,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And PlayStation games are going to be coming to the service, which is pretty cool.

1086
01:30:16,209 --> 01:30:16,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Except...

1087
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:25,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I think these are like these are deep cut PlayStation games like ODT Escape or Die Trying, Tiger Shark, Motor Mash.

1088
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:30,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are going to be things like We Got the Rights Real Cheap, which OK, whatever, whatever works.

1089
01:30:31,946 --> 01:30:37,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, which I thought was really interesting, Pico 8 is going to be added to AntStream and some games that they get on that.

1090
01:30:37,412 --> 01:30:38,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1091
01:30:38,813 --> 01:31:07,568
[SPEAKER_06]: if you didn't know Anstream it is like a legal emulator but it's not actually an emulator because it's a cloud service it's a cloud gaming service so you're actually running classic arcade games and console games and all that shit off the cloud so that's pretty cool and a lot of fun so yeah so if that is of interest to you you can check that out it's on Xbox it's on Playstation it's on PC it's not on the Switch yet but if it would I bet they would get more subs on that as well even though of course you're

1092
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:08,909
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not on the Mac, it doesn't count.

1093
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:12,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't looked into that to be honest.

1094
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:16,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll do some research and get back to you.

1095
01:31:16,832 --> 01:31:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, since I brought up classic gaming in some form, I think we might as well do this segment.

1096
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:40,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1097
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:44,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1098
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:47,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1099
01:31:48,555 --> 01:31:49,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you hate me?

1100
01:31:50,222 --> 01:31:50,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hate you.

1101
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:56,827
[SPEAKER_01]: You do because you're going to go to do that panel and not even bring me back a souvenir.

1102
01:31:57,067 --> 01:31:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an attack, and I want to explain why.

1103
01:32:00,169 --> 01:32:01,030
[SPEAKER_06]: This is revenge.

1104
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:09,876
[SPEAKER_06]: A classic game has to be at least 10 years old to be in this segment, and this is an attack picking this game and reminding me that this is 10 years old.

1105
01:32:10,236 --> 01:32:11,257
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a personal attack.

1106
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:12,338
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think I feel?

1107
01:32:13,863 --> 01:32:14,903
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think I feel?

1108
01:32:15,023 --> 01:32:20,105
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the classic aging, old, like we all are, classic game of the week?

1109
01:32:21,105 --> 01:32:22,286
Stop it.

1110
01:32:23,806 --> 01:32:28,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic game of the week is Shovel Knight.

1111
01:32:30,097 --> 01:32:36,624
[SPEAKER_03]: So Shovel Knight was developed and published by Yacht Club Games.

1112
01:32:37,544 --> 01:32:45,632
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crowdfunded and the game released on Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and Windows in June 2014.

1113
01:32:46,373 --> 01:32:48,535
[SPEAKER_03]: It's had many, many ports.

1114
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:49,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Other versions came out.

1115
01:32:50,017 --> 01:32:51,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be discussing them soonish.

1116
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:53,720
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1117
01:32:54,501 --> 01:33:00,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the very, you know, considered one of the greatest games ever made by a lot of people.

1118
01:33:00,944 --> 01:33:07,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it even had additional versions of it.

1119
01:33:07,246 --> 01:33:12,548
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a story with the retronym Shovel of Hope.

1120
01:33:14,649 --> 01:33:17,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the full game Shovel Knight Treasure Trove.

1121
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll move forward.

1122
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and there's also spin-offs.

1123
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:23,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into that in a minute.

1124
01:33:24,068 --> 01:33:27,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it is a 2D side-scrolling platform game.

1125
01:33:28,011 --> 01:33:33,415
[SPEAKER_03]: 2D with caveats, because I think part of it is in 3D as well.

1126
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a 3D base for 2D stuff.

1127
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:45,384
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, the base campaign, retroactively titled Shovel of Hope, you play as the Shovel Knight.

1128
01:33:46,285 --> 01:33:53,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to go rescue his partner, Shield Knight, while fighting the Enchantress and Order of No Quarter.

1129
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:15,187
[SPEAKER_03]: and he can dig because it's a shovel he can shovel and bounce with his shovel like pogo stick kind of like Scrooge McDuck and his cane I keep thinking of the shoveler from Mystery Men I shovel I'm damn good at shoveling yes you are um

1130
01:34:17,103 --> 01:34:31,062
[SPEAKER_03]: and so you have to fight the different knights from the Order of No Quarter you have checkpoints, you have boss battles stuff like that to go through treasures and then you can also find a salesman named Chester

1131
01:34:32,003 --> 01:34:56,109
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can purchase relics using your treasure and they will give you different magical abilities like invulnerability or one that shoots fireballs upgrades, things like that and you can also find sheet music that you can give to a bard and that gives you the play test the sound test for the game's music

1132
01:34:57,236 --> 01:35:14,623
[SPEAKER_03]: and then if you die in Shovel Knight you lose a portion of your treasure at the location of death and you can return to that area to get your lost treasure but if you die before you claim the treasure it's gone and you also have an option for challenge of destroying the checkpoints

1133
01:35:17,452 --> 01:35:39,824
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah there's all that you have a new game plus mode and so now we have the other things to come so we have downloadable content for features including challenge mode where you can do like speedrun or repeat battles a local co-op multiplayer DLC for you to do the main campaign in tandem

1134
01:35:40,704 --> 01:35:45,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-op on Nintendo platforms using the Shovel Knight Amiibo figures.

1135
01:35:47,346 --> 01:35:54,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Body swap mode where you can alter your gender or pronouns of certain characters in the Shovel of Hope campaign.

1136
01:35:54,828 --> 01:35:59,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were the other campaigns like Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment, and King of Cards.

1137
01:35:59,969 --> 01:36:23,092
[SPEAKER_03]: that have different playable characters who are boss characters in the Shovel of Hope campaign like you play as Plague Knight who freaking love Plague Knight you can play as Specter Knight and then you have King Knight who has like a shoulder bash attack and he also has a card mini card game called Justice

1138
01:36:25,192 --> 01:36:48,043
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Treasure Trove has a fighting game add-on called Shovel Knight Showdown that is not released on 3DS, Vita, or Fire TV and so you have a four-player fighting mode you also unlock other fighters in the story mode

1139
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:58,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these unique boss battles, like even fighting Kratos from God of War on PlayStation, or the Battletoads as enemies on Xbox One and Windows.

1140
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:04,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo 3DS has stereoscopic 3D and StreetPass Arena modes.

1141
01:37:04,373 --> 01:37:10,076
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fight players' ghosts on StreetPass.

1142
01:37:11,037 --> 01:37:17,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, basically, the designer, Nick Wozniak, he said that the game sort of started out as a joke.

1143
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:19,521
[SPEAKER_03]: and got serious.

1144
01:37:21,342 --> 01:37:34,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So they took the sword thrust move from Zelda 2 Adventure of Link and other attacks like ideas from Castlevania 3, DuckTales, Super Mario Bros.

1145
01:37:35,167 --> 01:37:43,551
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, Mega Man series, UN Squadron, also known as Area 88, Dark Souls and pretty much

1146
01:37:44,591 --> 01:37:45,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Put things together.

1147
01:37:45,672 --> 01:37:50,616
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew it was going to be Shovel Knight, but Plum at Night also showed up in the suggestions.

1148
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,438
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the Kickstarter on March 17, 2013.

1149
01:37:53,499 --> 01:38:00,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually hit all of its goals and exceeded and got like $311,502.

1150
01:38:00,285 --> 01:38:00,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1151
01:38:07,592 --> 01:38:19,001
[SPEAKER_03]: They also distributed some copies of the demo to people on YouTube and Game Grumps and a few other online ones.

1152
01:38:19,522 --> 01:38:22,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shovel Knight was originally supposed to be a princess.

1153
01:38:24,706 --> 01:38:28,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was referred to as Princess MacGuffin by the development team.

1154
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:31,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they...

1155
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:54,611
[SPEAKER_03]: and instead though for later on they did like the body swap mode and had the enchanter instead of the enchantress and you know different kinds of things they were looking at like different styles of characters and different things that they wanted to do but you know we ended up with what we got and then um there of course there's a chiptune soundtrack uh done by an NES era composer Jake Kaufman who um

1156
01:38:55,531 --> 01:39:01,535
[SPEAKER_03]: We also had contributions from the Mega Man composer Matsumai Manami.

1157
01:39:02,475 --> 01:39:04,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And the soundtrack is on Bandcamp.

1158
01:39:05,497 --> 01:39:07,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was supposed to just mimic the NES.

1159
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

1160
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, as far as the releases, it was originally supposed to come out September 2013, but came out in 2014 instead.

1161
01:39:21,525 --> 01:39:25,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had all those extras I mentioned earlier.

1162
01:39:26,007 --> 01:39:32,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And then before 2017, the game was released with the name Shovel Knight, just Shovel Knight, and then DLC after that.

1163
01:39:33,510 --> 01:40:01,068
[SPEAKER_03]: and then after that update they gave it the retroactive title subtitle Shovel of Hope and then of course the Treasure Trove so an enhanced edition of Shovel of Hope DX was announced in June this year to be released on Steam with 20 different playable characters, online multiplayer, rewind and save states in-game cheats and additional content and

1164
01:40:04,173 --> 01:40:09,215
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ghost Battle Arena is coming back, formerly the StreetPass Arena.

1165
01:40:10,155 --> 01:40:16,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as far as awards, oh my god, the game won a bunch.

1166
01:40:16,618 --> 01:40:29,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It won Best Independent Game at the Game Awards 2014, Nintendo Life's Reader Awards, Nintendo Life Staff Awards, it won eShop of the Year games in multiple categories.

1167

1168
01:40:40,751 --> 01:40:43,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it really, really did.

1169
01:40:43,653 --> 01:40:49,017
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the Amiibo figure, as I mentioned earlier, and it was the first Amiibo that was produced by a third party.

1170
01:40:49,577 --> 01:41:07,106
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there was an Amiibo 3 pack with Plague Knight, Specter Knight and King Knight came out in 2019 and with a gold variant of the other Shovel Knight figure there was Arby's toys I didn't know there were Arby's toys I don't really eat fast food though I had no idea there were Arby's toys, wow

[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's Shovel Knight Dig.

1181
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:06,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um...

1182
01:42:17,345 --> 01:42:22,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It was initially released on Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and Windows.

1183
01:42:22,749 --> 01:42:25,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was ported to Mac OS and Linux.

[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

1187
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:40,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Shovel Knight.

1188
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:43,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I wasn't going to eventually do this anyway.

1189
01:42:44,002 --> 01:42:44,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but...

1190
01:42:46,101 --> 01:42:46,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1191
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:48,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember I backed this Kickstarter.

1192
01:42:51,185 --> 01:42:51,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.

1193
01:42:51,985 --> 01:42:52,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1194
01:42:53,086 --> 01:42:53,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally did.

1195
01:42:54,227 --> 01:42:54,527
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1196
01:42:55,008 --> 01:42:57,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Shovel Knight is your classic game of the week.

1197
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:00,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it or not, because of the age.

1198
01:43:00,752 --> 01:43:06,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of you will like it, but maybe not because you realize that you are also 10 years older since this game came out.

1199
01:43:07,857 --> 01:43:08,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1200
01:43:08,718 --> 01:43:08,898
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1201
01:43:09,787 --> 01:43:34,758
[SPEAKER_06]: we got to experience a lot of cool shit we have we have I mean we also got to experience some shit shit but you know still yeah the planet earth is four billion years old but you exist at the same time that Dolly Parton exists never forget that it's important Dolly Parton is a fucking treasure all right um Bobby Blago says it's amazing that you backed a kickstarter so early that it was able to come out in time to be a classic game in 2024 I know right

1202
01:43:36,616 --> 01:43:39,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also like, Kickstarter's that old at this point?

1203
01:43:39,059 --> 01:43:40,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I guess it is.

1204
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:40,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.

1205
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:46,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's check out some other headlines real quick in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1206
01:43:47,007 --> 01:43:47,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1207
01:43:48,618 --> 01:43:57,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we have the TimeSplitters PlayStation 2 trilogy coming to PlayStation Plus this next week.

1208
01:43:58,264 --> 01:44:02,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'd be TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2, and TimeSplitters Future Perfect.

1209
01:44:03,066 --> 01:44:13,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And then along with that, also The Witcher 3 and Ride 5 are going to be available on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.

1210
01:44:14,933 --> 01:44:15,974
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, they have tiers.

1211
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:19,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I don't have to worry about that anymore.

1212
01:44:20,131 --> 01:44:21,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I have tears paying for stuff.

1213
01:44:24,853 --> 01:44:26,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, other things.

1214
01:44:26,634 --> 01:44:32,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got also these Retro Realms arcade games.

1215
01:44:32,777 --> 01:44:36,139
[SPEAKER_05]: They're being put together by Boss Team Games and WayForward.

1216
01:44:36,799 --> 01:44:45,724
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working on two horror kind of 16-bit games, one based off of Halloween and the other one based off of Evil Dead, which kind of...

1217
01:44:46,684 --> 01:44:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1218
01:45:13,277 --> 01:45:24,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know if I should facepalm at this, but it does sound like this article is saying they scraped the bottom of the barrel for movie adaptations.

1219
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:26,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But Eternal Champions!

1220
01:45:27,962 --> 01:45:28,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Eternal Champions!

1221
01:45:29,303 --> 01:45:29,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember?

1222
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:31,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely.

1223
01:45:32,264 --> 01:45:33,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting a movie treatment.

1224
01:45:33,264 --> 01:45:33,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1226
01:46:04,565 --> 01:46:07,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what they were called.

1227
01:46:07,446 --> 01:46:12,248
[SPEAKER_06]: That era of the mid-90s fighting game, or late 90s, you always had to have some type of finish thing.

1228
01:46:13,749 --> 01:46:17,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, Tigerclaw says it's being written by the screenwriter of the Jurassic World movies.

1229
01:46:19,551 --> 01:46:22,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well those aren't that good either, so, you know.

1230
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Overkills.

1231
01:46:23,592 --> 01:46:24,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Overkills and sudden deaths.

1232
01:46:26,148 --> 01:46:29,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm with DarkTetsuya who says, I'm about the same place I usually am for these.

1233
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:31,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me a trailer and I'll decide where I am with it.

1234
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:32,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1235
01:46:33,131 --> 01:46:35,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to know how I got my last copy of Eternal Champions?

1236
01:46:35,852 --> 01:46:36,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I've got a few.

1237
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:37,833
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

1238
01:46:38,013 --> 01:46:40,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Buying an activator at Virgin.

1239
01:46:40,754 --> 01:46:41,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

1240
01:46:41,994 --> 01:46:43,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too long after I moved out here.

1241
01:46:43,915 --> 01:46:44,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1242
01:46:44,955 --> 01:46:45,956
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that?

1243
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And that Virgin megastore became Urban Outfitters is now a party city.

1244
01:46:50,758 --> 01:46:52,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was the Barnes and Noble now.

1245
01:46:52,899 --> 01:46:53,779
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's the place next door.

1246
01:46:55,319 --> 01:46:55,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1247
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:55,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1248
01:46:56,501 --> 01:46:57,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's the same area.

1249
01:46:57,623 --> 01:46:57,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1250
01:46:58,284 --> 01:46:58,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1251
01:46:59,226 --> 01:47:01,029
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is the, yeah.

1252
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:01,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1253
01:47:03,093 --> 01:47:07,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember being new out here and going, oh my gosh, this place actually exists.

1254
01:47:07,781 --> 01:47:08,182
Yeah.

1255
01:47:09,392 --> 01:47:10,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Virgin Megastore.

1256
01:47:11,114 --> 01:47:15,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the one in San Francisco we would go to to get like import albums and shit.

1257
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:18,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's the only place you get like Kylie Minogue import B-sides.

1258
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:19,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, amazing.

1259
01:47:19,721 --> 01:47:25,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought Dan's first Christmas present at that Virgin.

1260
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:25,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1261
01:47:25,346 --> 01:47:26,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what I bought him?

1262
01:47:26,787 --> 01:47:27,207
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

1263
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:30,731
[SPEAKER_03]: The Last Action Hero on Laserdisc.

1264
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:32,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, nice.

1265
01:47:32,677 --> 01:47:39,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, hey, while we're talking about a trip down memory lane, maybe some of you are going to be into the Sunsoft Retro Game Collection.

1266
01:47:40,342 --> 01:47:43,244
[SPEAKER_06]: It is getting a local release on the Switch.

1267
01:47:44,164 --> 01:47:54,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It was originally going to only be for the PlayStation 5, but now it's going to be a digital version on the Switch as well, coming out on the 6th of September.

1268
01:47:55,652 --> 01:48:01,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to have three games in it, which is Firework Thrower, Kantaros, 53 Stations of the Toad,

1269
01:48:02,376 --> 01:48:04,217
[SPEAKER_06]: to Kaido is one of them.

1270
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:07,500
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wing of Mandula is another one.

1271
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ripple Island is the third game.

1272
01:48:10,762 --> 01:48:13,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't know if any of these were really released in the US.

1273
01:48:13,764 --> 01:48:25,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of these are Japanese games, but they are also, you know, for example, the director of The Wing of Mandula was also the director of Blaster Master, which was another big Sunsoft release at some point.

1274
01:48:25,212 --> 01:48:25,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1275
01:48:26,012 --> 01:48:36,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some of you that are into your more obscure and lesser known 8-bit era titles will be very excited about this or it's a chance to discover something brand new.

1276
01:48:37,994 --> 01:48:45,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out a little sooner than that this week in World Release Dates.

1277
01:48:45,095 --> 01:48:45,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1278
01:48:46,175 --> 01:48:47,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot, but we got some big things.

01:48:48,096 --> 01:48:53,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting off with Black Myth Wukong on PC and PlayStation 5.

1280
01:48:54,077 --> 01:48:54,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a big one.

1281
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is a pretty big one.

1282
01:48:57,422 --> 01:49:03,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Dustborn on PC and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1283
01:49:04,408 --> 01:49:06,650
[SPEAKER_05]: StumbleGuys on Nintendo Switch.

1284
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:09,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a ripoff of Fall Guys?

1285
01:49:09,953 --> 01:49:10,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like it.

1286
01:49:12,157 --> 01:49:25,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Mika and Witches Mountain on PC and Nintendo Switch Concord on PC and Playstation 5 and then Harvest Moon Home Sweet Home on iOS and Android That's it

1287
01:49:26,664 --> 01:49:27,305
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1288
01:49:27,805 --> 01:49:30,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, going to Japan, you know, last week we had no releases.

1289
01:49:30,787 --> 01:49:34,469
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, folks, this week is not exactly picking up very well.

1290
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:37,851
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have at least one release on the Nintendo Switch.

1291
01:49:38,212 --> 01:49:41,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the NT Creates Gold Archive Collection.

1292

1293
01:49:46,377 --> 01:49:51,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, DarkSakura, you can get a puzzle game called Puzz Mix, where you mix it up with songs and puzzles.

1294
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:52,361

1295
01:49:52,381 --> 01:49:52,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1296
01:50:02,492 --> 01:50:31,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Dustborn is getting a deluxe edition that's out in Japan this week as well I don't know why the regular edition maybe it's a digital only type of thing but yeah Dustborn is also getting a collector's edition in Japan this week otherwise kind of slow so we'll go to DarkSakura in the UK well and also looking at my calendar checking all this out it made me remember that I was supposed to do my marathon next weekend and not this weekend

1297
01:50:34,175 --> 01:50:37,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let me plan anything when I'm sick, okay?

1298
01:50:38,498 --> 01:50:47,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, on the 20th, that is for PlayStation and Xbox, we have Dustborn Deluxe Edition.

1299
01:50:48,683 --> 01:50:53,506
[SPEAKER_03]: 22nd for the same two, Tiebreak, official game of the ATP and WTA.

1300
01:50:53,626 --> 01:50:54,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is tennis.

1301
01:50:56,488 --> 01:51:01,091
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 23rd for Switch, Disney Magical World 2 Enchanted Edition.

1302
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:07,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Also for the Switch on the same day is Turbo Boost Racing Kit.

1303
01:51:08,475 --> 01:51:08,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1304
01:51:09,436 --> 01:51:10,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a peripheral thing.

1305
01:51:12,097 --> 01:51:14,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Trek Winter Wonderland.

1306
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:19,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And also on the 23rd, we have Concord for PlayStation.

1307
01:51:22,962 --> 01:51:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1308
01:51:23,322 --> 01:51:35,330
[SPEAKER_06]: We have just a couple more stories for you, and then we will get to the listener roundtable where we will take any calls over on our Discord server, which I encourage you to join to talk to us throughout the week over at vognetwork.com.

1309
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:37,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1310
01:51:38,052 --> 01:51:39,373
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll also get to any emails.

1311
01:51:39,493 --> 01:51:41,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at orangezonsradio.com.

1312
01:51:41,494 --> 01:51:44,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Although when I last looked, I think it's just a lot of pet pictures.

1313
01:51:44,576 --> 01:51:47,097
[SPEAKER_06]: People are actually responding to your call for pet pictures, which is nice.

1314
01:51:47,157 --> 01:51:47,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an email.

1315
01:51:48,279 --> 01:51:49,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so at least we have one of those to read.

1316
01:51:49,682 --> 01:51:52,227
[SPEAKER_06]: But until we get there, we got a couple stories.

1317
01:51:52,488 --> 01:51:54,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I can always still use more pet pictures, though.

1318
01:51:55,053 --> 01:51:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1319
01:51:55,454 --> 01:51:56,717
[SPEAKER_06]: You can never have enough pet pictures.

1320
01:51:57,078 --> 01:51:57,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1321
01:51:58,191 --> 01:52:17,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I know when we heard about the announcement of this game a while back, I was mildly interested in it being that it is a VR version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which arguably is very old at this point.

1322
01:52:18,075 --> 01:52:21,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really feel like a good candidate for VR, but...

1323
01:52:22,403 --> 01:52:32,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't have to worry about that because now Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the MetaQuest VR is on hold indefinitely while they focus on other projects.

1324
01:52:32,968 --> 01:52:37,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say they look forward to working with their friends at Rockstar Games in the future.

1325
01:52:40,871 --> 01:52:42,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.

1326
01:52:43,772 --> 01:52:45,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not be surprised if this is cancelled.

1327
01:52:46,654 --> 01:52:49,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that video game news for Not Gonna Fucking Happen?

1328
01:52:50,390 --> 01:53:19,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like they're probably, if you think about it, they're they're like, okay, well the development time that we would need to convert this over to VR and put it onto the MetaQuest which, you know what are the real sales gonna be there versus eh, let's just put those devs on Grand Theft Auto 6, which is gonna make us billions of dollars I think the answer's pretty easy yep, yep

1329
01:53:21,415 --> 01:53:48,771
[SPEAKER_05]: go make GTA 6 happen as fast as possible which will still be a process like honestly even if it did come out on the MetaQuest I can't imagine it would be good and I can't imagine that that would be like a system seller game for that platform like if it was Grand Theft Auto 5 VR okay we're talking there now and that's a thing that like people modded on the PC but like

1330
01:53:50,356 --> 01:53:52,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Quest VR can't handle that.

1331
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:53,959
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're doing San Andreas.

1332
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1333
01:53:56,741 --> 01:54:06,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockstar Games can't handle updating San Andreas either because they outsource it to cheap companies that do a terrible job of it and then they have to catch all the stuff in the future.

1334
01:54:06,547 --> 01:54:08,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm good.

1335
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:10,150
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need a VR port of it.

1336
01:54:12,478 --> 01:54:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, one more story for y'all tonight that has to do with Gamescom, and this is admittedly very much a non-story story, but of course with Opening Night Live on the way, which as you know is one of the semi-annual events,

1337
01:54:29,926 --> 01:54:35,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Entries in the Keelyverse, along with what we have, the Video Game Awards, right?

1338
01:54:36,288 --> 01:54:40,488
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Summer Game Fest would be the other two entries.

1339
01:54:41,188 --> 01:54:44,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So he has a winter one, he has a late summer one, he has an early summer one.

1340
01:54:44,369 --> 01:54:48,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say if he gets a spring one, then he'd have a very, very full year there.

1341
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:51,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, opening night live is happening.

1342
01:54:51,511 --> 01:54:53,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, just in case you were unaware...

1343
01:54:54,520 --> 01:55:01,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It is confirmed from Jeff Keighley himself, the Doritos Pope, yes, there will be new game announcements.

1344
01:55:03,463 --> 01:55:05,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

1345
01:55:05,164 --> 01:55:14,030
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an addition to existing announcements that we know are coming like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civ 7, Call of Duty Black Ops 6.

1346
01:55:14,271 --> 01:55:18,293
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be some new games announced as well.

1347
01:55:19,094 --> 01:55:20,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So something to consider.

1348
01:55:20,995 --> 01:55:30,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega has said they will be showing off Sonic X Shadow Generations, but there's also an unannounced project they will be showing as well.

1349
01:55:30,482 --> 01:55:30,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1350
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:34,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantasy Star Online 3

1351
01:55:49,076 --> 01:55:52,179
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1352
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:08,774
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

1353
01:56:37,813 --> 01:56:38,773
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1354
01:56:53,959 --> 01:56:59,868
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, the email is one and it... Why are you doing this to me?

1355
01:57:00,489 --> 01:57:01,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

1356
01:57:01,691 --> 01:57:07,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, it's only one very quick email and it comes from Brad, PodCulture.

1357
01:57:07,519 --> 01:57:07,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Brad.

1358
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a new Bioshock game.

1359
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:15,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because you asked when, okay, remember when I spilled coffee everywhere and you were filling time?

1360
01:57:16,253 --> 01:57:20,476
[SPEAKER_06]: You said email us what game you want to see, a sequel to it.

1361
01:57:20,496 --> 01:57:22,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know I forget what I do.

1362
01:57:22,577 --> 01:57:26,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad gets a gold star for actually answering and saying he wants a new Bioshock game.

1363
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:30,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, you actually followed the instructions and got the assignment done.

1364
01:57:30,623 --> 01:57:31,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

1365
01:57:31,363 --> 01:57:31,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Mazel tov.

1366
01:57:33,024 --> 01:57:33,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1367
01:57:34,212 --> 01:57:36,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, the coffee did not leave that bad of a stain.

1368
01:57:36,674 --> 01:57:37,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very happy with that.

1369
01:57:37,854 --> 01:57:38,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1370
01:57:39,696 --> 01:57:41,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Adventures in Homeownership!

1371
01:57:43,278 --> 01:57:46,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you will get your Bioshock game if the rumors are to be believed.

1372
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

1373
01:57:47,481 --> 01:57:49,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Could it be something we see at Gamescom?

1374
01:57:50,022 --> 01:57:51,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'd head my bets on it.

1375
01:57:51,303 --> 01:57:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the type of thing you'd see in a PlayStation or Microsoft Direct.

1376
01:57:55,065 --> 01:57:56,807
[SPEAKER_06]: But never say ever.

1377
01:57:56,847 --> 01:57:58,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But if rumors are to be believed...

1378
01:57:58,988 --> 01:57:59,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1379
01:58:26,192 --> 01:58:28,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Judas was the name of that.

1380
01:58:28,973 --> 01:58:32,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I should know that because it's a Lady Gaga single, but yes, it's Judas.

1381
01:58:35,315 --> 01:58:35,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1382
01:58:35,856 --> 01:58:36,076
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1383
01:58:38,256 --> 01:58:41,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a holy fool, but baby, it's a Judas.

1384
01:58:41,518 --> 01:58:43,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think Shies is a better song.

1385
01:58:44,799 --> 01:58:45,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a single, though.

1386
01:58:45,699 --> 01:58:47,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't have a video.

1387
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:47,400
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1388
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do we have any last minute stories coming in?

1389
01:58:51,857 --> 01:58:52,318
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.

1390
01:58:52,478 --> 01:58:54,020
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some fun stuff.

1391
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:55,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start off with...

1392
01:58:56,855 --> 01:58:59,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So tomorrow, we're going to be getting a Nintendo Direct.

1393
01:58:59,577 --> 01:59:01,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Nintendo Museum Direct.

1394
01:59:01,458 --> 01:59:04,500
[SPEAKER_05]: No game announcements, nothing about the new Switch stuff.

1395
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:11,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about the Nintendo Museum that is opening in Kyoto, Japan this fall.

1396
01:59:11,605 --> 01:59:15,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, I don't think people should be too quick to write this off.

1397
01:59:15,267 --> 01:59:17,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, understand the expectation.

1398
01:59:17,829 --> 01:59:18,870
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no game announcements.

1399
01:59:18,890 --> 01:59:20,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about that.

1400
01:59:20,451 --> 01:59:24,474
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm talking about is, what are we critical about with Nintendo all the time?

1401
01:59:25,054 --> 01:59:26,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Game preservation.

1402
01:59:27,295 --> 01:59:29,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is now opening a fucking museum.

1403
01:59:29,878 --> 01:59:33,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am curious from that standpoint to see what are they doing?

1404
01:59:33,521 --> 01:59:35,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to have some games playable here?

1405
01:59:35,762 --> 01:59:38,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a Nintendo game for them that they can put in.

1406
01:59:39,165 --> 01:59:40,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It belongs in the museum.

1407
01:59:41,967 --> 01:59:43,429
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll put it in the bathroom.

1408
01:59:43,669 --> 01:59:45,891
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll put it in the bathroom where it belongs.

1409
01:59:47,981 --> 01:59:49,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is in a museum already.

1410
01:59:50,082 --> 01:59:53,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it will be in, I can put it in multiple museums.

1411
01:59:53,503 --> 01:59:58,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so anyway, as far as like, what is Nintendo doing as far as game preservation goes?

1412
01:59:58,665 --> 02:00:01,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's your chance to find out.

1413
02:00:01,486 --> 02:00:06,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all I'm saying is that, yeah, again, you're not going to see, and again, that doesn't mean more game releases.

1414
02:00:06,847 --> 02:00:08,508
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not what this direct is about.

1415
02:00:09,716 --> 02:00:10,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay in the right lane for this.

1416
02:00:11,077 --> 02:00:11,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm curious.

1417
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it sounds like it's going to be the type of place where we want to go.

1418
02:00:17,583 --> 02:00:18,424
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's that.

1419
02:00:18,544 --> 02:00:22,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget, we had that news a few months ago that Nintendo's coming to Union Square.

1420
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:25,250
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo's going to be on both coasts.

1421
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:32,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And I find, obviously, as somebody who lives a lot closer to San Francisco than New York City, I'm very, very curious what that's going to look like.

1422
02:00:32,797 --> 02:00:33,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited about that.

1423
02:00:33,578 --> 02:00:36,060
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are more than two coasts.

1424
02:00:37,947 --> 02:00:50,552
[SPEAKER_06]: There are, but I don't see them opening a Nintendo store in New Orleans anytime soon or Tallahassee or something along the Gulf Coast or I guess there really isn't a North Coast.

1425
02:00:50,572 --> 02:00:52,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess the Great Lakes maybe.

1426
02:00:52,492 --> 02:00:53,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicago could get a store.

1427
02:00:53,653 --> 02:00:55,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Chicago could get a store.

1428
02:00:55,353 --> 02:00:57,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Chicago gets the store before Tallahassee.

1429
02:00:59,055 --> 02:01:01,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no one goes to Tallahassee anyway unless they're like NASCAR.

1430
02:01:03,863 --> 02:01:13,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then the next bit of news I have is not shocking after its immediate failure in the box office.

1431
02:01:14,090 --> 02:01:17,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands is coming to digital platforms August 30th.

1432
02:01:20,174 --> 02:01:21,415
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fast!

1433
02:01:22,535 --> 02:01:31,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep in mind, not necessarily the purchase, but, you know, I'm assuming another couple weeks after that and they'll be free, right?

1434
02:01:32,082 --> 02:01:32,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1435
02:01:34,005 --> 02:01:37,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's still not going to make any money if you have to pay $30 to rent it.

1436
02:01:37,708 --> 02:01:46,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I would say it's probably a very brief amount of time before it's on Max or Paramount Plus or one of those whatever.

1437
02:01:47,114 --> 02:01:49,856
[SPEAKER_06]: What studio made, I don't even know, what studio made that movie?

1438
02:01:52,078 --> 02:01:54,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that'll tell you what streaming service is coming to, that's all.

1439
02:01:56,781 --> 02:01:57,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1440
02:01:57,802 --> 02:01:58,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1441
02:01:58,822 --> 02:01:59,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It is...

1442
02:02:02,549 --> 02:02:03,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Legendary Pictures.

1443
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:06,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of their stuff goes to Max, but I could be wrong.

1444
02:02:06,673 --> 02:02:07,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's Warner Brothers.

1445
02:02:08,015 --> 02:02:08,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1446
02:02:09,036 --> 02:02:09,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1447
02:02:09,416 --> 02:02:09,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1448
02:02:11,338 --> 02:02:11,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeesh.

1449
02:02:11,859 --> 02:02:12,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeesh.

1450
02:02:14,221 --> 02:02:14,521
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1451
02:02:14,581 --> 02:02:15,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to flop.

1452
02:02:17,344 --> 02:02:18,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other stories for us, Loki?

1453
02:02:21,072 --> 02:02:28,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Bully's been rated for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC in Taiwan.

1454
02:02:28,435 --> 02:02:29,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1455
02:02:29,635 --> 02:02:31,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's coming back.

1456
02:02:32,156 --> 02:02:33,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, maybe that's a Gamescom thing.

1457
02:02:34,396 --> 02:02:34,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1458
02:02:34,877 --> 02:02:41,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Rockstar is like, we need something to keep the lights on until Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out.

1459
02:02:41,178 --> 02:02:44,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as if Grand Theft Auto Online wasn't making them enough.

1460
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:47,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We need something to keep, it's a Bully, a redo of that.

1461
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe they're going to do a new game.

1462
02:02:51,525 --> 02:03:07,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't give this one no, because this one is the Canis Canem edition which came out a while back, so it's not a new one I could see them doing a remaster or port or something like that maybe

1463
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1464
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:14,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with that, it's time to wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night.

1465
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:16,021
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will be back next week.

1466
02:03:16,341 --> 02:03:18,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about whatever happens at Gamescom this week.

1467
02:03:19,002 --> 02:03:20,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be very interesting.

1468
02:03:20,182 --> 02:03:20,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So stay tuned.

1469
02:03:20,942 --> 02:03:25,563
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back in seven days to talk all about that before we are off for the Labor Day holiday.

1470
02:03:25,683 --> 02:03:27,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll have a fun show next week.

1471
02:03:27,084 --> 02:03:29,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're here in seven days to do it all over again.

1472
02:03:30,084 --> 02:03:33,225
[SPEAKER_06]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

1473
02:03:33,525 --> 02:03:38,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1474
02:03:38,766 --> 02:03:45,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell a friend or two or five a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show.

1475
02:03:46,328 --> 02:03:49,669
[SPEAKER_06]: That goes an awful long way as well, so we really appreciate all of that.

1476
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:51,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get final thoughts.

1477
02:03:51,389 --> 02:03:56,870
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with DarkSakura, who I am assuming is going to be off into the Dead by Delight adventures.

1478
02:03:57,611 --> 02:03:58,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not this time.

1479
02:03:58,991 --> 02:03:59,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play Palia.

1480
02:04:00,191 --> 02:04:00,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

1481
02:04:01,612 --> 02:04:02,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because...

1482
02:04:03,965 --> 02:04:06,528
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wore myself out yesterday, and I can't believe I'm so stupid.

1483
02:04:06,568 --> 02:04:11,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it on my calendar that it was supposed to be on the 24th, and instead I did it yesterday.

1484
02:04:12,995 --> 02:04:14,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what that means?

1485
02:04:14,317 --> 02:04:15,178
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do it all over again.

1486
02:04:16,308 --> 02:04:16,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace!

1487
02:04:16,448 --> 02:04:16,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye!

1488
02:04:46,207 --> 02:04:48,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, that brings me over to you.

1489
02:04:48,168 --> 02:04:49,389
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your final thought for us tonight?

1490
02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:55,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I'll have another episode out on this week at some point.

1491
02:04:55,475 --> 02:04:58,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll work on editing that down.

1492
02:04:58,357 --> 02:05:02,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already got it filmed and built and I just have to edit it.

1493
02:05:04,376 --> 02:05:08,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought is I don't really have much of one tonight.

1494
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everybody has a great week.

1495
02:05:11,162 --> 02:05:13,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited for DragonCon on the horizon.

1496
02:05:13,944 --> 02:05:17,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And just very thankful it's going to be an awesome, awesome year.

1497
02:05:17,546 --> 02:05:20,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's always an awesome year, but it's going to be an extra awesome year.

1498
02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:23,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, we'll see you in seven days, everybody.

1499
02:05:23,691 --> 02:05:23,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

1500
02:05:26,373 --> 02:05:28,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1501
02:05:30,799 --> 02:05:31,299
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.
