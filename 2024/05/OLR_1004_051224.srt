1
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:10,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time.

2
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:11,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming.

3
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:11,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really happening.

4
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:16,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be announced sometime in the next 10 months.

5
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:26,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite Nintendo's communication being immensely streamlined with its E3 Treehouse presentations and directs made entirely on its own schedule, its flagship console is obviously unique enough to be the exception to these practices.

6
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Redundancy Department of Redundancy headline.

7
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:34,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now in the show, every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:47,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:59,893
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1004 of our show for tonight, May the 12th of 2024.

12
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Mother's Day to all our gamer mommies out there.

13
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:06,995
[SPEAKER_06]: If that label applies to you, then apply it.

14
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:08,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And also a special

15
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:23,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday to Bobby Blackwolf, who we share the stage with at the Voice of Geeks Network each and every Sunday night, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after Birthday Boy Bobby Blackwolf, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

16
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:26,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 29th birthday to Bobby.

17
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I am joined by, of course, I'm Rob Roberts, in case you forgot, and I am joined every week by the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:35,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

19
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:36,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how's it going?

20
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:38,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going.

21
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, weekends always too short, but it is what it is.

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Truth.

23
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,791
[SPEAKER_06]: The weekends have been way too short lately.

24
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just flies by.

25
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:47,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate.

26
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:50,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't help that I spent half of yesterday sleeping.

27
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:53,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I had such a long busy week.

28
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:53,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

29
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:55,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I crashed hard yesterday.

30
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it was something else.

31
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:57,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I walked 10,000 steps.

32
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:57,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

33
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:06,452
[SPEAKER_06]: But because Pikmin had a challenge weekend thing in Pikmin Bloom.

34
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:09,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you get 10,000 steps, you get a badge.

35
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:12,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what that badge means?

36
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:13,915
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a badge.

37
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:14,416
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

38
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,236
[SPEAKER_06]: It means nothing.

39
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:22,740
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have a little electronic pixel thing in my profile that says I, I was a special kid today.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

41
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,301
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did it.

42
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went out with friends to do it.

43
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:29,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess there's that whole like, yay, doing things together.

44
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:29,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

45
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:30,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

46
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:36,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you accomplish anything big in video games this week, DarkSakura?

47
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a bunch of them.

48
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,808
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we'll get in.

49
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:43,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I did beat a game.

50
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, we'll get into that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.

51
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me mention though, you mentioned next week, you may or may not be here because you got a big thing you're going to, right?

52
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:58,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, next weekend is Golden State Pinball Festival in Lodi, California.

53
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:02,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anyone is going to go, please find me.

54
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually may be doing some commentary on TheSpinnerIsLit, or at least the one for the local pinball group in Lodi, I think.

55
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to find the channel name again because it's been a minute.

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:33,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be hanging around and doing stuff and playing some games and reporting and there will be little TikToks posted hither and yon so yeah I kind of want to go I've never been

57
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,750
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

58
00:03:51,566 --> 00:04:05,604
[SPEAKER_03]: On Friday night there is like a dinner thing for people involved in the group that I'll be attending, but I have work that day mostly.

59
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:08,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Same, I mean, I can always go at night.

60
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Lodi, right?

61
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that far.

62
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's at the Grape Festival.

63
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not that far.

64
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll probably go inside.

65
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:24,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was thinking, so at the end of Bobby's show tonight, you know, because we're listening to it usually while we're sitting here waiting to go, he was talking about the new John Wick table that got announced.

66
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you were mentioning, so I was thinking about how I'm kind of sad.

67
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:29,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look

68
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:30,168
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonCon 2021

69
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:00,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Atlanta's full.

70
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And driving in Atlanta is worse than Los Angeles.

71
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:27,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Atlanta's full.

72
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:28,720
[SPEAKER_06]: No more.

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,883
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but so what was I really?

74
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:33,305
[SPEAKER_03]: No vacancy.

75
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no vacancy.

76
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,650
[SPEAKER_03]: The big no vacancy sign outside of Atlanta is flashing.

77
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:49,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Southern Fright always has like the cool stern presence and you get to play a lot of pinball machines, including usually new pinball tables like last year, Venom was, you know, everywhere, which I think was their new table.

78
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:52,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But you were saying you get a little bit of that at the Golden State Pinball Expo too.

79
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe you get to peek at this new John Wick table.

80
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, nothing's confirmed, but

81
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping so.

82
00:05:57,494 --> 00:06:13,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave Stern has had a presence there with demos, although I think if there were going to be a convention that would be most likely to have an appearance at, it would be California Extreme, which is next month, is it?

83
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:13,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,601
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a room for California Extreme, so we'll be there for the whole thing.

85
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:22,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been to California extreme in years, years.

86
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's great.

87
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:24,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

88
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:24,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

89
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,170
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it's just always that conflict with my very busy personal life.

90
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I'd love to I'd love to see that.

91
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:37,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say the Stern presence here is at the Sacramento coin op downtown.

92
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,316
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a big star and I keep meaning to get down there to play games, but they were being remodeled for a while.

93
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,797
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they finally reopened recently.

94
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:45,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't seen it since the remodel.

95
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:45,938
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know,

96
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to ask Dan who's in charge of the tables there.

97
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:54,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only do they have pinball, they just got a Stepmania X machine, which is a pretty big deal.

98
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:58,785
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the kind of the spiritual successor to DDR of sorts.

99
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess DDR is still going though.

100
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's kind of both things going on.

101
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,749
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, we have a story on that later, but I'll, I'll wait for later.

102
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:10,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, for now, though, I can't let him just sit there any longer.

103
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

104
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:17,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I haven't been feeling myself lately.

105
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Joking aside, I'm actually sick.

106
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,306
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, what in the Bobby Blackwolf voice changer on your fucking microphone?

107
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you running tonight?

108
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have the demon voice he does too?

109
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:31,810
[SPEAKER_06]: We might need it tonight.

110
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes, I do, actually.

111
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:36,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

112
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

113
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:38,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

114
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:45,175
[SPEAKER_06]: or as Travis Donovan used to call it DJ Satan was that voice.

115
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

116
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:54,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, uh, I was gonna ask what I really wanted to ask about was the, you know, because I see a game with a cat playing in the background.

117
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I'm always going to be interested in a game with a cat.

118
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I feel like I've seen that one.

119
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,604
[SPEAKER_06]: That one just came out like this last couple weeks, right?

120
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

121
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Cat.

122
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:05,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the name.

123
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:06,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Little Kitty Big City.

124
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:06,407
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

125
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Little Kitty Big City.

126
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, have you played it or just watching it on?

127
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:14,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I have I finished it because it's a very short game.

128
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:15,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

129
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:16,428
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

130
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:17,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

131
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little kitty in a big city.

132
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

133
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:22,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a Japanese city.

134
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a it's a Japanese kitty in a Japanese city.

135
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's great.

136
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:30,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's yeah, we're checking out but it's a cute little game.

137
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you look in the camera and say that again?

138
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:36,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little kitty in a big city.

139
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:37,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little kitty in a big city.

140
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

141
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,024
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

142
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look right at the camera.

143
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:43,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it?

144
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:44,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

145
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

146
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:49,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little kitty in a big city.

147
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:50,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Clip it!

148
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:53,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

149
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's see.

150
00:08:55,371 --> 00:09:00,273
[SPEAKER_06]: In chat, Bobby Blackwolf is asking, isn't this like Untitled Goose Game but with a cat?

151
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Johnny Wufei calls it Actual Titled Cat Game.

152
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

153
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:10,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It has that same like kind of visual style to it.

154
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is some things you're doing.

155
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:15,354
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not necessarily terrorizing people so much.

156
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:23,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You do a little bit of terrorizing, but it's mostly helping animals around the town and stuff doing different things.

157
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,903
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is there is some minor terrorizing of the pedestrians.

158
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:32,207
[SPEAKER_05]: You do end up stealing a cell phone at one time and you can knock people over.

159
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:32,607
[SPEAKER_05]: As a cat.

160
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:38,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, as a cat, it's it's like, yeah, it's like an exploration game.

161
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's probably.

162
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it for about four hours.

163
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't 100% of it, but I did most of the things I'd say, like 90% of the game.

164
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably like a six hour game at most.

165
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,949
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, there's nothing wrong with a short and sweet game.

166
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, no, not not at all.

167
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's it's it's like you collect hats.

168
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's lots of hats that you can wear.

169
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:03,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

170
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:26,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat.

171
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:32,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear there's more people chatting tonight, but Bobby's just hitting a lot of zingers, or I want to make him feel good because it's his birthday.

172
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:33,237
[SPEAKER_06]: You pick.

173
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:38,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, short and sweet games are great, like Little Kitty, Big City, and Hi-Fi Rush.

174
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:40,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hold that thought.

175
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the news here.

176
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure y'all are thinking about it.

177
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:44,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, we will.

178
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,099
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be talking about that.

179
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,840
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, let's do a follow up here.

180
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't usually get to do a follow up as a kickoff topic.

181
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:59,866
[SPEAKER_06]: But how about this, and the joys of doing a live show that then pushes to the podcast feed later that night.

182
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:00,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've, I've

183
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:04,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been very good over the last probably 500 episodes.

184
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:13,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't always good in the history of this show, but I would say probably ever since the All Games move, which was a long time ago, quite frankly, if not the VOG move, certainly.

185
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:21,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty good about getting the show all packaged and put on the podcast feed by probably midnight Pacific time.

186
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:29,677
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time I go to bed Pacific time, it's up on the podcast feed right around the time those overseas across the Atlantic are waking up, they can download it and do all that.

187
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:46,190
[SPEAKER_06]: once in a great while maybe because of a technical mess up or I have to do some deeper editing or just a personal engagement right after the show once in a great while maybe it's delayed by a day but for the most part it hits the feed by midnight pacific by the time this show hit the feed

188
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,493
[SPEAKER_06]: There was already a huge update to what we spent the entire opening of the show last week talking about.

189
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:54,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was, of course, Helldivers 2.

190
00:11:54,894 --> 00:12:03,377
[SPEAKER_06]: We got into it with the debate last week, but it was good spirited debate talking about the industry and everything, talking about all the perspectives and what we could do about it.

191
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it turns out

192
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:06,739
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't need to do anything further about it.

193
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:11,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony was already preparing the press release to change course.

194
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:15,843
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation wrote in a tweet that went out at nine o'clock Pacific.

195
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:19,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was timed nine o'clock Pacific on May 5th.

196
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:22,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So literally less than 45 minutes after our show ended, probably less than 30.

197
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:29,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Helldivers fans, we've heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update.

198
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:39,460
[SPEAKER_06]: The May 6th update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30th, will not be moving forward.

199
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,042
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable.

200
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:49,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again for your continued support of Helldivers 2 and we'll keep you updated on future plans.

201
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:56,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that talk we were talking about how to get to Sony and how to get get our way and all that.

202
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:56,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

203
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:06,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, I say that, but I think some of us also kind of see that well, this has worked for now.

204
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But for example, we have Ghosts of Tsushima, the director's cut is coming.

205
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that is still going to require

206
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,401
[SPEAKER_06]: a Steam and PlayStation-linked account to play online.

207
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:27,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, there is a single-player mode you may not need, and they yanked Ghost of Tsushima's sales in many, many countries, pretty much all the countries where there isn't PlayStation Network.

208
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:37,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see already that Sony is laying the groundwork to do this in the future, and that groundwork is they will not sell in the non-PlayStation Network countries in the future.

209
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the solution.

210
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Deft is confirming Ghost of Tsushima only needs a PSN account for multiplayer, but still pretty crappy.

211
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention that now a lot of countries don't have access to those games now.

212
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.

213
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So this issue isn't going away necessarily.

214
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:27,734
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, for Helldivers, and for that game and that experience, the review bombing and the vocalize on Twitter and all the other things have had their effect.

215
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,295
[SPEAKER_06]: They reverse course.

216
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:29,715
[SPEAKER_06]: For now.

217
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Tada.

218
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So all right.

219
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:42,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, um, let's move on and talk about the other big story going on because that was in the news for like a day.

220
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:47,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some other big news dropped and just stole the whole damn show.

221
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:50,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's talking about this Loki.

222
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:52,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you recap what's going on at Microsoft?

223
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So Microsoft decided, hey, you know, we have a lot of goodwill.

224
00:14:57,098 --> 00:15:01,360
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you say we just burn all of it right about now?

225
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they did.

226
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:07,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, well, essentially, you simply you made this news so simple and easy to digest.

227
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:08,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just easy.

228
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,926
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to break it down for a bit.

229
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It just works.

230
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:12,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It just works.

231
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:24,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So Microsoft announced that they're going to be shutting down four studios that they had acquired under the Bethesda Xenimax umbrella.

232
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:36,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Those studios being Arcane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and well Roundhouse Games is actually being absorbed into Xenimax Online.

233
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:43,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcane Austin worked on Redfall as well as, you know, they previously did like the Dishonored series and that type of stuff.

234
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:56,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Tango Gameworks did the extremely popular and, you know, hitting all the possible accolades that Microsoft ever would possibly want this game to hit, Hi-Fi Rush.

235
00:15:56,119 --> 00:16:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And then AlphaDog Games did Mobile Doom.

236
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:04,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that,

237
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:07,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

238
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:24,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, according to Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios, these changes are grounded in prioritizing high impact titles and further investing in Bethesda's portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds, which you've nurtured over many decades.

239
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:26,597
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, they're going to keep making Fallout.

240
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:33,461
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to keep making Elder Scrolls and they're not going to take risks on anything else.

241
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:52,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with that, you know, they're saying that they're hoping to consolidate their Bethesda studio team so they can invest more deeply in their portfolio games with new IP and smaller number of roles across selected publishing corporate teams will be eliminated.

242
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:53,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like...

243
00:16:55,457 --> 00:17:03,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcane Austin makes some sense a little bit with, you know, how bad Redfall did.

244
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:08,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's to say I would still cut them some slack because of all of the Dishonored stuff.

245
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Prey was pretty well received too.

246
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Prey, exactly.

247
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering that this is like a game that sounds like it was more of like

248
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:35,656
[SPEAKER_05]: by committee by sea level suite executives saying oh hey we want we want you to make a live service game and you have to like force it in there and it has to be out on xyz date period exactly so i think there's a lot of that that needs to be accounted for there

249
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:40,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't love this whole studio makes one flop game and they're shut down.

250
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But I get it.

251
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:48,371
[SPEAKER_06]: The optics of when they announced that this studio was shutting down, there definitely was that moment of, well, yeah, Redfall wasn't great.

252
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,892
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was like, I hate that.

253
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:51,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of hate that.

254
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:55,239
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're conditioned to accept that.

255
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what were you saying?

256
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was going to say, well, that makes some sense or like you can kind of paint that picture.

257
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:14,357
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Tango Gameworks with Hi-Fi Rush, which sold great, won tons of awards and was generally one of the best games that came out last year for the Xbox platform.

258
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:15,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes no sense.

259
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And Evil Within, which many people were hoping for a sequel to as well.

260
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:27,643
[SPEAKER_06]: A second sequel, before I get corrected in chat.

261
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:31,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, yeah, oh, well, bad game, studio gets closed.

262
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Good game, studio gets closed.

263
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,061
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

264
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:38,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That logic doesn't make any sense.

265
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:49,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely am not going to defend the logic, but I do want to point out that Tango Gameworks was already having some transitions behind the scenes before this news.

266
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Most notably, Shinji Mikami had already left Tango Gameworks quite some time, and apparently he even

267
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if he tweeted.

268
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he tweeted.

269
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:05,545
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, tango closed sad.

270
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,248
[SPEAKER_06]: That was his reaction, which I mean, is really all that needs to be said.

271
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,951
[SPEAKER_06]: But he he left some time ago and has founded a new company.

272
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again, I certainly am not defending the decision.

273
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:22,479
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is one of those things where you kind of go, Hmm, someone maybe saw the writing on the wall and got out.

274
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, possibly.

275
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

276
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:31,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And even still, though, like having a Japanese studio, you're trying to work your way into the Japanese market.

277
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why?

278
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Why just throw that all away?

279
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:45,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't understand, especially after they had a profitable game and by their own admission, like it hit every metric that they could possibly have for that game.

280
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some exceeded those metrics.

281
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:51,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Microsoft's phrasing on that, like,

282
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's, this is, this is what it is.

283
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:56,995
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what it is.

284
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:02,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so obvious, you know, and Phil Spencer's taken a lot of heat for this, what's going on this week.

285
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not, I'm not here to defend him.

286
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:14,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize I've talked very up on Phil Spencer, because I do think especially on the personality side of things, he's brought a lot of good things to the game industry.

287
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not here to defend him.

288
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,048
[SPEAKER_06]: However,

289
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:21,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel like this whole thing reeks of something that wasn't his decision.

290
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,873
[SPEAKER_06]: This came from above him.

291
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:30,940
[SPEAKER_06]: This reeks of something that came from the highest of highest levels, at the Microsoft level, not even considering the gaming's division.

292
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why I say that is because we have all these stories coming out left and right

293
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah Bond

294
00:20:56,205 --> 00:21:09,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I kinda, like, if I was in her shoes, which I'm really glad I'm not, I don't know what else there is to say because it just reeked of, it was not her decision, but she had to defend this decision that was coming up from even above her.

295
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:13,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Microsoft is scrutinizing Xbox.

296
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

297
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,339
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

298
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:18,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft is scrutinizing Xbox at the highest level.

299
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:22,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that sucks about this is that this was very much a spreadsheet.

300
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,125
[SPEAKER_06]: What's coming in?

301
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,146
[SPEAKER_06]: What's coming out?

302
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,167
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the plan?

303
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this?

304
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:34,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you think that spreadsheet said, oh, this was up for so many Game of the Year awards or oh, this has so much goodwill in the community?

305
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:38,259
[SPEAKER_06]: No, these cuts were made based on red ink only.

306
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:43,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where these cuts were made by people who don't know anything about video games.

307
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:50,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the funniest part about it too is because like right after they closed those studios, they're like, hey, you know what we really need?

308
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We need smaller games that are winning awards and stuff like that.

309
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you already had one.

310
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,441
[SPEAKER_05]: You just you closed the studio.

311
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:58,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

312
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:14,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and it goes to show the disconnect again between I think the people that are actually running Xbox and the people in the even higher suite at Microsoft and God, probably wanting to put even more people on Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Copilot because that's where they see the future and all that stuff.

313
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:24,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's you know, and I've kind of thought about the real like ugly response this whole thing has had on social media and rightfully so I get why people are pissed.

314
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi-Fi Rush was a great game.

315
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:41,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also great to see Microsoft investing in some pretty cool things and kind of carving out this own identity for themselves that they have had a very hard time navigating in this war with Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Switch or whatever you want to call it.

316
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,646
[SPEAKER_06]: They've had a very hard time carving out their own identity beyond Halo.

317
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:47,250
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

318
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:17,993
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been sitting here for years and I don't mean just us here at Orange Lounge Radio but we're part of it and I think a lot of you that are really passionate about video games and a lot of people out on the internet have been sitting here for a very long time defending this idea and supporting this idea and uplifting this idea that video games are art.

319
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:20,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games are art.

320
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:25,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people saw Hi-Fi Rush as a pretty cool piece of art that like that's a neat video game.

321
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:28,219
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we want to see video games go.

322
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:38,304
[SPEAKER_06]: This week was a kick in the face reminder that video games are in fact, a business.

323
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:38,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And that sucks.

324
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:53,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's not to say that there can't be an overlap, that art and business can kind of go hand in hand a little bit, because just look at the movie industry, specifically the big budget movie industry.

325
00:23:53,224 --> 00:24:04,413
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're seeing a lot of extremely similar painful points happening over in that industry, because the business is making the decisions, not the art.

326
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:25,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, it's all the corporate, the over corporatization of the world basically that is kind of causing all this because if you look at it's not just like in the video game space, it's everywhere that you have corporate decisions, executives ruining all sorts of things by

327
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:29,353
[SPEAKER_05]: just mismanaging everything.

328
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:40,436
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no accountability for these upper management because they make these decisions to close these studios and then they get like millions and millions of dollar bonuses from doing all of this.

329
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:43,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it doesn't matter how badly they mismanage it.

330
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:45,218
[SPEAKER_05]: They get so much money from it.

331
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:46,238
[SPEAKER_05]: You look at Bobby Kotick.

332
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:47,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, perfect example.

333
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:51,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

334
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things too, Matt Booty also explained that, you know, basically Xbox and Bethesda studios have been spread too thin.

335
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:00,797
[SPEAKER_05]: He called it like peanut butter on bread.

336
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:07,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think peanut butter spread on bread is very thin, but whatever.

337
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:11,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That the team leaders felt understaffed.

338
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:19,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to support nine studios across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do.

339
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're about to topple over.

340
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop buying studios then.

341
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that...

342
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,203
[SPEAKER_06]: That is purely a commentary.

343
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:34,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a shooting yourself in the foot comment because that's purely a commentary on the management and the executive level decisions that are going into that.

344
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:35,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that.

345
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:37,015
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that happen?

346
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:39,338
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's a fault of management.

347
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:39,959
[SPEAKER_06]: The only

348
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:53,528
[SPEAKER_06]: In that whole thing you were explaining, the only thing that makes sense is the move of the studio that got absorbed into doing Elder Scrolls Online type of work, because that's reallocating the resources, right?

349
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:55,490
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why that one doesn't feel as painful.

350
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:01,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure it's and I'm sorry to folks that work at that studio that may be listening.

351
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:08,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, you sort of feel a little more like, okay, well, at least those folks are still working and the resources are being allocated where it makes sense.

352
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:13,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it kind of sucks that that isn't happening at a higher level at Microsoft.

353
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:24,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really sucks that the board and the CEO above above make these decisions and none of them are ever liable.

354
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:27,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is why I wouldn't be sad to see Phil Spencer leave after this.

355
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:30,750
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I don't think that's going to happen.

356
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, I, I, I'm not sure he's completely to blame.

357
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,274
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a little bit to blame.

358
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:41,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of this mismanagement is certainly on him, but I don't think he's as much to blame as those above him.

359
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So who signed off on the ABK acquisition in the first place?

360
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:52,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It, it just shows you like, here's the thing is like, I think to take it even more basic than that, it's like,

361
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

362
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:11,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I want to play the Sarah Bond quote from it because SSA 100 Matt actually found it.

363
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize my co host because the way things are wired, you guys can't hear this.

364
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:17,853
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to play this here just so those that haven't heard it can hear it.

365
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Because she really does.

366
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:23,818
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really word salad here and but but kind of listen to it.

367
00:27:23,818 --> 00:27:26,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to it out now that we've talked about this.

368
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,362
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't taken a second to digest this.

369
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:33,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Now listen to this and listen to her comments in the context of

370
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:39,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having to speak for a decision that I had no say in.

371
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:46,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I'm the president of Xbox, I am now going to speak for a decision I had no hand in.

372
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:47,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm going to play this clip.

373
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

374
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:52,698
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from a Bloomberg interview that's been circling around Twitter and it's on YouTube as well.

375
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:57,531
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I really love about the games industry is it's a creative art form.

376
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:25,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And it means that the situation and what success is for each game and studio is also really unique.

377
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:30,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's no one size fits all to it for us.

378
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:43,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with sort of making decisions and trade-offs like that.

379
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:56,717
[SPEAKER_01]: But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the services, and ensuring that we're setting ourselves up to be able to deliver on those promises.

380
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:01,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, you can see it in her face.

381
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:04,039
[SPEAKER_06]: This is painful for her.

382
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:08,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying not to read into it too much, but I can see it on her face.

383
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:09,605
[SPEAKER_06]: This is painful.

384
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:12,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something she really wanted to talk about, but too bad.

385
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:14,990
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you're getting paid to do, right?

386
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,251
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the whole thing.

387
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:19,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And this answer that she gives about the whole, well,

388
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:25,457
[SPEAKER_06]: each studio kind of has its different measures that it's held to.

389
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:29,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of it is to ensure the long term success.

390
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:41,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, when you kind of listen to it at that highest level, it like it even just comes through more that it's like, yeah, each studio was really measured at its own sort of level.

391
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:45,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it was, well, it's going to take us four years or five years to make a hi fi rush to

392
00:29:46,426 --> 00:30:01,211
[SPEAKER_06]: or an Evil Within 3 or whatever it is we're working on, then you know what, sorry, it's not worth the investment because the second half of what she says, we have to invest in the long-term projects and the long-term future and all of that as well.

393
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:10,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, many folks in chat are calling out how then the producers over at Bloomberg then frame it with this shot in the background.

394
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:15,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those in the podcast, there's a shot of Microsoft's Xbox

395
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:22,639
[SPEAKER_06]: year over year growth and you see a lot of painful years and then you see it just take off.

396
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:24,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to read the labels.

397
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to assume that's 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, or maybe, you know, some type of financial year.

398
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:27,822
[SPEAKER_06]: But

399
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:39,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I will also say this in fairness of the graph, as much as it's easy to point and go, this is awkward.

400
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:51,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, keep in mind, the Xbox one and that entire era was a pain point for Microsoft that they've corrected with game pass and all this other stuff.

401
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:51,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

402
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And E3VL says it's declining at the end.

403
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:53,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

404
00:30:53,618 --> 00:31:01,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everything took off during COVID and all of that time, you know, and this is, this is the industry kind of, you know, this is a problem in the industry as a whole.

405
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:01,745
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact,

406
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:05,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing I was kind of thinking about with all of this

407
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:14,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel like, you know, we're coming up on about 41 years since one of the biggest things that has ever happened in the video game industry.

408
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:25,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the video game crash of, I usually say 1984, but many people would say it actually started around 83 and didn't really end until the NES came out in America in 85.

409
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:29,108
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was this whole video game crash of 83, 84.

410
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:32,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some ways, I really feel like what we're going through now,

411
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,773
[SPEAKER_06]: is another video game crash.

412
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different kind.

413
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:40,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's not the exact you know, I like a lot of people are gonna be quick to correct me.

414
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the original video game crash was about you know, the the influx of cartridges or retail spaces that well,

415
00:31:47,785 --> 00:32:14,842
[SPEAKER_06]: hold on there's there's some common themes actually going on here and that is that whole retail space and what that all looks like is changing as we see that Target and all these stores are starting to get rid of the shelf space for video games which is weird because it's like what the industry kind of wants in a way but you know that's all leading to this whole thing and just you know again the the industry having these huge expectations and

416
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought of it.

417
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:27,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of everybody wants their own Atari cartridge, everybody wants their own cartridge, everybody wants to make their own thing, everybody wants to make their own live service game.

418
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:30,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

419
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:33,252
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the video game crash of 2024.

420
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:36,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody thinks they can make their own instead of an Atari cartridge.

421
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:45,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It's they're making their startup to do their own battle pass, to do their own live service game, to do their own free to play mobile title, to do their own way on how this is going to work.

422
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:52,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is all coming to this head that a lot of that is very expensive to make, and it's all falling apart.

423
00:32:53,925 --> 00:33:06,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And so yeah, again, it's not a one for one, but there are so many similarities that I really think what we're looking at right now is that video game crash that many people have been saying has been coming for a long time now.

424
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:07,375
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happening.

425
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, is it going to affect the consumer in the same way?

426
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:19,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know, again, indies, self publishing, that's always still going to kind of be a thing that is always there in the back of the industry.

427
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,821
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like video games are going to go away or anything like that.

428
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:32,890
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really think you know, when it comes to what we're looking at right here, the closure of these big studios and the removal of these big titles.

429
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there is some commonality there.

430
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:36,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

431
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:45,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Just something I was thinking about with all this and just the layoffs on layoffs on layoffs.

432
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:51,606
[SPEAKER_06]: This industry is changing, and it's hard to feel like it's for the better.

433
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:59,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to mention some additional things regarding Arcane.

434
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:03,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they were obviously still working on Redfall during this whole time.

435
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:10,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So along with that, you know, there was the Battle Pass and all that stuff.

436
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:16,580
[SPEAKER_05]: DLC that was promised to the players of Redfall that is not coming out anymore.

437
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:19,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're they're not going to continue development on it.

438
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:26,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So now, of course, Xbox is going, well, the servers are going to remain online for players to enjoy.

439
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:34,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we will make we'll provide make good offers to players who purchase the Hero DLC.

440
00:34:34,318 --> 00:34:38,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they were working on offline mode because the game was online only.

441
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,744
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not going to happen anymore.

442
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:45,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And that mode was almost done.

443
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:45,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

444
00:34:46,303 --> 00:35:14,734
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course we have HiFiRush was supposed to come out on the switch at some point it's been kind of teased for a long time well don't expect that one because there's no one left to make it and and hit the publish button or whatever you want to call it so it's it's it also kind of feels like dang like when they turn it off they turn it off when they make a move they make them like almost like you know inconsequential of anything else

445
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Comments in chat?

446
00:35:31,602 --> 00:35:35,005
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100 Matt says entertainment sector in general is leaning towards this.

447
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:42,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel Studios even said that they're going to cut down on MCU movies and shows to maybe two a year rather than several.

448
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:52,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, talk about an area that feels like spread thin peanut butter or whatever the hell that analogy was like that I would absolutely applies in the Marvel Universe as well.

449
00:35:54,171 --> 00:36:01,196
[SPEAKER_06]: SheHulk10 in chat says, I really enjoyed Redfall and I predict it will be considered a must play classic game and one of the best games ever made someday.

450
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:02,496
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite a statement.

451
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,158
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know that Redfall has its fans.

452
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:14,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say this, that single player thing, probably the only... I don't see a negative coming out of the single player thing.

453
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:17,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have served to bring in new fans, if nothing else.

454
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:21,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that that isn't going to happen, it sucks.

455
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:51,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if modders don't figure this out or so I wonder if something doesn't happen where there's I mean it might be a little I know with server and you'd really be talking about the games code I realize it's it's maybe maybe maybe someday well here's the thing here's the thing okay so this this is something that sometimes happens game studios close assets are sold off dev code that's unfinished magically gets out there somehow

456
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:58,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the codes found later on and all sorts of things come out.

457
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:04,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not to say there'll never be a HiFiRush 2, because Microsoft now owns the IP.

458
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:07,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe maybe Blizzard makes a HiFiRush 2.

459
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:07,532
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't.

460
00:37:07,532 --> 00:37:09,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, maybe another studio makes a HiFiRush 2.

461
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:12,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I wouldn't get my hopes up.

462
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:17,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And it may not look the same or, you know, really be what you're hoping for.

463
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:17,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But

464
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:23,607
[SPEAKER_06]: They do own the name at this point, and that's about all they own.

465
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:30,715
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just this has just been a hard thing to watch for the industry as a whole.

466
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those when it when is this going to end?

467
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:34,535
[SPEAKER_06]: When when when?

468
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:37,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say though, you know, what's interesting in this whole thing?

469
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:40,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'm going to bring I brought this up before, but I have to bring it up again.

470
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:42,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know, what's interesting in this whole thing.

471
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:46,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We have watched these studios, layoffs, all this stuff.

472
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:53,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, who seems to be in their own fucking bubble, doing their own thing and immune to all this once again, Nintendo.

473
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of those weird things.

474
00:37:56,124 --> 00:38:02,852
[SPEAKER_06]: where I feel like Nintendo purposefully being behind the curve on tech has actually really paid off for them.

475
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:03,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

476
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:05,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo games don't have battle passes.

477
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo games don't do any of that stuff.

478
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:09,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And here they are sitting fine.

479
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:12,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

480
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Just interesting.

481
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:14,249
[SPEAKER_06]: For now.

482
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I didn't season passes.

483
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I didn't just damn them with that comment.

484
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Kinda.

485
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:19,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have.

486
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just DLC.

487
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:26,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nintendo has a pretty good reputation of having pretty decent DLC.

488
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:29,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the exception of Splatoon three.

489
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:31,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's where you're starting to see it slip a little bit.

490
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:36,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But they also happen to have more responsible management.

491
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I Yes, yes.

492
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:55,632
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a precedent set already, rest in peace Iwata, but that was the example I think that others in the company sort of strive to follow, at least that's the feeling that I have.

493
00:38:56,973 --> 00:39:06,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I think it may be just a very Japanese thing to put the interest of the company above your own interests.

494
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:08,206
[SPEAKER_03]: What's best for longevity?

495
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: What's best for everybody there instead of what's going to line my pocket?

496
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:23,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I hope this is the last we have to report on studio closures this year, but I fear it won't be.

497
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:25,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have no choice but to move on.

498
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:32,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just very hard to be a video game enthusiast when all the enthusiasm is getting sucked out of the room.

499
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I play old shit.

500
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't blame you.

501
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:40,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And DJ Ranma S also brings up an interesting perspective that really plays into this whole situation.

502
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:42,940
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S says, Rob, that's the answer.

503
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is a gaming company.

504
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:47,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft is a tech company.

505
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:49,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony is a multimedia company.

506
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,027
[SPEAKER_06]: There's your difference.

507
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also Nintendo makes cards.

508
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:58,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, they have a pretty big arm on the retail front, too.

509
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:02,806
[SPEAKER_06]: But just, you know, yes, that goes back to the gaming.

510
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:04,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

511
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:11,690
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're seeing happen to Microsoft this week was the tech arm of the company making changes in the gaming arm.

512
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,911
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happened.

513
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I think succinctly, yes.

514
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:15,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is this happen to Microsoft?

515
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:17,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Why doesn't it happen at Nintendo?

516
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:19,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a very succinct way of putting it.

517
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:19,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

518
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:26,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway, let's talk about the games that do bring us joy and do make us enthusiastic as we talk about our gaming weeks.

519
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,885
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

520
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I know you had mentioned some big things in your week.

521
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:31,310
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

522
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:33,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Busier than usual.

523
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of time trying to figure out different games to play.

524
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I did beat Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight last night.

525
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:49,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I will continue to call it by its Japanese name since I was playing the Japanese version.

526
00:40:49,765 --> 00:40:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the Sega Saturn one, but translated to English with the PSP dialogue and most of the dialogue voices, although all the background voices were still the same.

527
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that game.

528
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a fun game.

529
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:14,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, once I had the walk armor and my Yata Tuna, which took forever to get, I beat the game.

530
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:15,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was happy with it.

531
00:41:16,132 --> 00:41:20,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my happy ending with Maria chasing after Alucard.

532
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:23,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoilers for a bajillion years old game.

533
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:27,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Also played Dead by Daylight, because of course I did.

534
00:41:27,877 --> 00:41:30,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Also played Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

535
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:37,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I am waiting for whatever the season pass stuff to kick in.

536
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,803
[SPEAKER_03]: They said summer, so maybe.

537
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:43,665
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm finishing up all of the quests I have left to do.

538
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:48,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I busted out more of the classics.

539
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:59,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played Vulfied for PC Engine, aka TurboGrafx-16, which is the successor to Kix.

540
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:04,430
[SPEAKER_03]: and I screamed at it a lot last night.

541
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:10,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Played a little Knuckles Chaotix, just enough to remember why I don't play Knuckles Chaotix.

542
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:15,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I played X-Men Children of the Atom for Saturn, you know, the fighting game.

543
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:18,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of have lost my ability to play that game.

544
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:21,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I played another fighting game called Rabbit for the Saturn.

545
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:24,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really pretty.

546
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:26,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a bunch of Luminesce today for PSP.

547
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:30,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game.

548
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:32,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the music in it.

549
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:38,719
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I might move on to Luminesce 2, just because I like the music in that better.

550
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Galactic Pinball for Virtual Boy, and that's enough to realize why I do not play anything on the Virtual Boy.

551
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:53,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Summer Carnival 92, Elzotic, for the PC Engine.

552
00:42:53,787 --> 00:43:01,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another one of those, like Wrecka was, the summer carnival games, the little shooting game that was timed, and I had fun with it.

553
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:07,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And I play a bunch of Star Parodia, also for PC Engine CD.

554
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Super CD-ROM!

555
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:26,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I played as the PC Engine, and I love the power-ups in that game, because, like, when you get a shield, it's little PC Engine controllers, and one of your secondary weapons is shooting out a bunch of CDs, and you collect two cards for your power-ups.

556
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:33,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I also started playing something that I immediately now regret starting to play.

557
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:39,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I started playing that RuPaul game on my iPhone.

558
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:40,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Help.

559
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know there was a RuPaul game.

560
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:46,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That game wants you to watch a bajillion ads and spend all of your money.

561
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:50,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of sick at it, but it's also a good waste of time.

562
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:57,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing wordscapes because, you know, I like making my brain do things.

563
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

564
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:58,782
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

565
00:43:59,434 --> 00:44:00,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a bunch.

566
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:03,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you had a very busy week, busier than mine.

567
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:03,736
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Loki.

568
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:05,657
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

569
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:08,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this week, I actually played different things.

570
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my goodness.

571
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:10,299
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

572
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's nuts.

573
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you and what have you done with Loki?

574
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:16,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I've been trying to like play other things.

575
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:20,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you know, funny enough, my my son wanted me to set up Steam family sharing.

576
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:23,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So now he has access to like 900 games.

577
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:25,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know,

578
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, yeah, I played, of course, Little Kitty, Big City.

579
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So I almost 100% of that played that for like a few hours the other day.

580
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:35,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been like extremely tired.

581
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:49,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of this, whatever this virus is I have now, it's like kind of like a bronchitis, pneumonia thing, but thankfully don't have pneumonia, but still annoying.

582
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just like really like

583
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,041
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

584
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:16,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what it is, but it's some sort of virus that causes like a bacterial infection and stuff and it's not fun.

585
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:21,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, so I was playing, yeah, Loki, Big City.

586
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up, I haven't played it yet, but I picked up that new...

587
00:45:27,088 --> 00:45:29,469
[SPEAKER_05]: and gosh, I don't remember what it's called now.

588
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:30,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

589
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:36,213
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the new Big Mode game, their first publishing game, Animal Well or something like that.

590
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's maybe what it's called.

591
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:45,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, going back to my recent favorite game so far this year is, of course, Turbo Kid.

592
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Been playing more of that.

593
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:56,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Really great Metroidvania game and just working more on the Minecraft stuff, doing a lot of aimless things in game just to try to

594
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,984
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

595
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:23,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the mod to downgrade Fallout and I was like, ah, that looks like a lot of work.

596
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:25,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go play the cat games.

597
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:27,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't play Fallout 4, unfortunately.

598
00:46:29,773 --> 00:46:46,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well my gaming week, I had a pretty busy week with work, was doing some traveling and stuff, so not a lot of gaming time, but I did play Diablo 4, as I have been, but big breaking news, I finished the Battle Pass.

599
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:51,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I was working so hard on, because there is a big patch coming on Tuesday.

600
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: BATTLE PASS REWORK

601
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:20,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I finished the battle pass that felt good.

602
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:35,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And then otherwise I've been playing mostly and DarkSakura I wonder if you know that this is a thing because I remember this was a when you love this game the most but World of Warcraft classic got its cataclysm pre patch this last week.

603
00:47:36,070 --> 00:48:05,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have been playing I started a worgen to experience that whole storyline again and I've been playing what's essentially cataclysm I think the only thing like I think it's still walled off you can't go from 80 to 85 yet but you know you can do the whole like all the you know how like the world changed all that all of that is in place and all the quality of life stuff more importantly is there and it's interesting to see some of the quality of life things they kept from modern wow just a few but like the transmogrifier and all that stuff and the

604
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:12,034
[SPEAKER_06]: the way that you have just a library of all the gear you've accumulated through time that you can transport.

605
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:15,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all in the game, which I don't think was there at least during the first.

606
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:18,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I think transmogrifier became a thing that came out.

607
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't work later.

608
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:21,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it came out later, but it didn't work the same way.

609
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it come out around Pandaria?

610
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:25,323
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be right.

611
00:48:25,323 --> 00:48:26,224
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be right.

612
00:48:26,224 --> 00:48:32,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the book was even during I think that was during like the like Warlords of Draenor, the expansion after, honestly.

613
00:48:32,748 --> 00:48:35,430
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I didn't play Warlords or

614
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I went right on to Legion after that.

615
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I keep playing it for weeks and weeks, probably not.

616
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:57,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start the new Diablo 4 season for sure.

617
00:48:57,738 --> 00:48:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, let's do it all over again.

618
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:03,140
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, Final Fantasy XIV is getting a huge patch.

619
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:13,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not a huge patch, but an event, the Moogletome event, which is what I will finish leveling everything to 90, because we're like six weeks away from the Final Fantasy XIV expansion.

620
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:15,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm all about that when that comes out.

621
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:20,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf says, are you going to pay for the battle pass?

622
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:28,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to really try to hold off this time and make sure I get far enough through it and I enjoy the season enough that it's worth it.

623
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:33,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when all said and done, season three was the weakest season.

624
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:35,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Season one and two were better.

625
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,567
[SPEAKER_06]: But to Blizzard's credit,

626
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:45,031
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do listen to player feedback because the dumbest thing about season 3 was the whole trap dungeons and all of that.

627
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:53,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And they made a patch pretty quickly into the season that really nerfed how many hits you could take in a trap dungeon and still get the reward.

628
00:49:53,535 --> 00:50:00,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they made it like 10 times as many hits and they just made it so much better through what they were doing.

629
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:02,480
[SPEAKER_06]: It became a little more bearable.

630
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,143
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the only reason I really liked season three was it was my first time playing a barbarian.

631
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:10,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, barbarians probably my favorite class in Diablo four so far.

632
00:50:10,726 --> 00:50:15,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And that even surprised me, but they are so much fun and really satisfying with the moveset.

633
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:21,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So next season, I'm going to play a mage, because it's the one so in

634
00:50:22,074 --> 00:50:25,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular Diablo 4 before there were Battle Passes, I played a Druid.

635
00:50:25,437 --> 00:50:27,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Season 1, I did a Necromancer.

636
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Season 2, I did a Hunter.

637
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Season 3, I did a Barbarian.

638
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only class I have left is Mage, Wizard, whatever you want to call it.

639
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:36,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I'm going to play this next season.

640
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:37,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

641
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:40,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave you a little incentive, Rob.

642
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:41,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring back Sassy Pants.

643
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:47,814
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my World of Warcraft character, my OG, the original World of Warcraft character was Sassy Pants.

644
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:52,501
[SPEAKER_06]: No, my current World of Warcraft character, you know, all the good names are taken.

645
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:53,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard.

646
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:59,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started to name, you know, I like to name after cute things, sugary things, which is ironic, I know.

647
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:01,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakfast cereals, things like that.

648
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:05,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So the name of my character is Donets, my hostess.

649
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,828
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob, if I started playing it,

650
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:15,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have because remember when we were going around with like our like complementary characters?

651
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:16,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

652
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: For a while.

653
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:20,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make Trixie and Katya.

654
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:21,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure those names are taken.

655
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:23,439
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd have to misspell them, but that would be.

656
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:24,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, screw that.

657
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,161
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the best.

658
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:28,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

659
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:31,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I still have Rebecca Black, though.

660
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:32,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that character.

661
00:51:32,663 --> 00:51:33,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That was that was fun.

662
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:35,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the best memory.

663
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,594
[SPEAKER_06]: doing things with friends and having vacation time.

664
00:52:00,594 --> 00:52:03,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll bring me back to my lord.

665
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:06,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I just it'll be in my belly.

666
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,103
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll bring I like my lord.

667
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:09,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm that weirdo.

668
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:12,547
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like this isn't as bad as you want to make it out to be.

669
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:12,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

670
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:16,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try it and and and those amazing chocolates.

671
00:52:16,188 --> 00:52:21,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll actually say I don't know how much I but I am going out for an Ingress event as well.

672
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:26,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's kind of a combo thing, because I can see my friends, Ingress is like a big thing.

673
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:32,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Ingress after party, we were able to pre buy shots of Malort.

674
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:34,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can actually get them out of a toilet bowl.

675
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,046
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

676
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:41,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ordered a shot of Malort in a toilet bowl that I will be doing.

677
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:42,970
[SPEAKER_06]: The little miniature ones.

678
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I see you making faces.

679
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:49,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go look up a toilet bowl of shot glasses.

680
00:52:49,393 --> 00:52:54,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Black Woman Chat says, Then again, you like Beverly, so I can see why you like Malort.

681
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: All I have to say is I exist.

682
00:52:55,937 --> 00:52:59,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not bothered by Jägermeister either, which most people are like.

683
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,287
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, no, Jägermeister is disgusting.

684
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:06,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's licorice.

685
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:10,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dirt.

686
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: God, even your Vtuber made a face.

687
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:16,112
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

688
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to screen cap that because that should be your new little icon.

689
00:53:23,852 --> 00:53:25,213
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

690
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:26,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on.

691
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:30,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about what else is going on in games, because there's a little bit this way.

692
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it for you.

693
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:31,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

694
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:32,238
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

695
00:53:32,238 --> 00:53:34,519
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Loki.

696
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:39,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a story about EA, so that's got to be a good story, right?

697
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:39,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Positive.

698
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:42,705
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we just came off of all these different.

699
00:53:42,705 --> 00:53:45,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they releasing a new pinball construction set?

700
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no.

701
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,710
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're they're adding ads to games.

702
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:57,515
[SPEAKER_05]: because, you know, that's what we want, you know, more money for EA.

703
00:53:57,515 --> 00:54:13,126
[SPEAKER_05]: So EA CEO Andrew Wilson said on a May 7th earnings call that he where he was asked about the dynamic ad insertion within AAA games and if he thought it was possible or a possible source of cash flow for the company.

704
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:23,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Wilson said EA sees advertising as a possible meaningful driver of growth, but wants it to be thoughtful about how ads could be implemented into its games.

705
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:52,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think he really wants, he's probably not thinking too much about how thoughtful ads could be inserted in the games and I assert, considering how many ads we already have in EA titles as it is when we're talking about sports because it's realistic to the sports broadcast, I honestly could see them just inserting this wherever they can to make as much money as they can considering that they're selling these games for $70

706
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:59,043
[SPEAKER_05]: on top of all the other things that they're selling with these games.

707
00:54:59,043 --> 00:54:59,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

708
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I don't buy EA games because it's sports or Star Wars at this point.

709
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:08,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there hasn't been a battlefield in a while.

710
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:15,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And yep, I don't really care to play those right now.

711
00:55:15,808 --> 00:55:16,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

712
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:19,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not surprising.

713
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:31,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and the whole thing that just feels like a kick in the crotch with all of this is that, you know, again, it's not like these games aren't going to continue to be $70 and now they're shoving ads into it as well.

714
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, it's like when your Amazon Prime plan that you are watching TV shows and movies ad free on suddenly gets ads into them, but the cost didn't go down at all.

715
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,521
[SPEAKER_05]: They are treating

716
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Triple A games like mobile get titles.

717
00:55:47,883 --> 00:55:50,786
[SPEAKER_05]: They are they're basically going.

718
00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:55,290
[SPEAKER_05]: See, because the way it is, is we had 2020 with the pandemic.

719
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,912
[SPEAKER_05]: All of all these companies profits went up.

720
00:55:57,912 --> 00:56:01,736
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem with these companies is they're always trying to have infinite growth.

721
00:56:02,336 --> 00:56:03,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just cannot do that.

722
00:56:03,878 --> 00:56:09,343
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not satisfied with, hey, we're a company that makes $20 billion in revenue or something like that.

723
00:56:09,343 --> 00:56:10,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's good enough.

724
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:13,306
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we can sustain ourselves.

725
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,949
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always going to make that 20 billion each year.

726
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:16,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

727
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:19,592
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they need to make more and more each year.

728
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:20,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is

729
00:56:21,348 --> 00:56:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: there are a finite number of, well, hours in the day, finite numbers of players, and those players have finite amount of money.

730
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:36,435
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can't just keep, you can't keep making more profit.

731
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're already super profitable as is, and they're doing lots of things to just, basically, it's just all for the shareholders.

732
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:48,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and I, yeah, I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but

733
00:56:50,066 --> 00:57:18,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to sound like a broken record but the thing is the only company again that I've ever heard the phrase cash on hand used with is Nintendo that they were able to absorb the floppage of the Wii U because they banked some of that money they made with the Wii and they set it aside in case they ever had a flop someday again I just the only company in gaming I ever seem to hear that phrase cash on hand with

734
00:57:19,551 --> 00:57:20,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Just interesting, that's all.

735
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:35,291
[SPEAKER_05]: well received because they were very intrusive.

736
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you may remember Capcom had some advertising in Street Fighter five, I believe five.

737
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:44,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

738
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:50,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter five, where they inserted all sorts of like logos on the players in the arena.

739
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was ridiculous.

740
00:57:52,496 --> 00:57:56,397
[SPEAKER_06]: This match sponsored by Bud Light or whatever it is.

741
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:58,918
[SPEAKER_05]: There were ads for the boys in UFC four.

742
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:05,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But once again, you know, there was, you know, backlash to that.

743
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:10,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you have a lot of these companies trying to sell advertising.

744
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:14,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark to Sia in chat says, Yeah, Street Fighter V was a mess from what I understand.

745
00:58:14,717 --> 00:58:17,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was an odd number Street Fighter game.

746
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:20,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Cue DarkSakura defending three.

747
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no.

748
00:58:22,173 --> 00:58:23,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

749
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:27,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you'd have something nice to say about three.

750
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:34,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, it didn't have Sakura, so why would I say something nice about it?

751
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,640
[SPEAKER_03]: They had very fluid movements.

752
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very nice.

753
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:43,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Even like, was it even, you know, Death Stranding had a Mountain Dew in it.

754
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:45,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just it.

755
00:58:46,687 --> 00:58:50,448
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of like product placement and stuff in these.

756
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Cup Noodle and Final Fantasy XV.

757
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:53,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the best.

758
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

759
00:58:54,169 --> 00:58:54,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

760
00:58:54,689 --> 00:58:57,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean.

761
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's just it.

762
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,171
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to vote with your wallet.

763
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:07,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, with EA, there's a lot of diehard sports fans that will literally buy anything that they put out.

764
00:59:07,573 --> 00:59:12,814
[SPEAKER_05]: They are kind of in like that cult likes, you know, cycle with them where

765
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:20,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there will be a breaking point at some point, but a lot of people... There are gamers that only game for Madden.

766
00:59:20,597 --> 00:59:23,101
[SPEAKER_06]: There are gamers that only game for Madden.

767
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, we have to accept that and that they are gamers too.

768
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:38,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and that's what that's what monopolies get you, because if you had multiple sports games out there, not to say that 2K would do any better, because they certainly aren't.

769
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:44,404
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had other sports games out there that were competing with each other, like multiple NFL games,

770
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:51,084
[SPEAKER_05]: If a company decides not to do that, that game could be possibly more popular.

771
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:52,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck the NFL.

772
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: No, fuck the NFL.

773
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:54,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote me.

774
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:55,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck the NFL.

775
00:59:55,227 --> 00:59:57,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Have Nintendo put out another super high impact.

776
00:59:57,569 --> 00:59:58,890
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need the NFL.

777
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:03,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put out something really fucking clever that goes around it.

778
01:00:03,614 --> 01:00:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario football.

779
01:00:05,676 --> 01:00:07,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Mario football?

780
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:07,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

781
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:11,739
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

782
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:16,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of Nintendo, how would you all like to get an announcement of an announcement?

783
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:18,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what we got this week.

784
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:22,603
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what Nintendo said about the Nintendo Switch 2.

785
01:00:22,603 --> 01:00:31,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, responding sort of to some of the many rumors out there, Nintendo President Shintaro Furukawa has officially confirmed via

786
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:41,498
[SPEAKER_06]: The world's favorite press release website, Twitter, saying that the Nintendo Switch successor will be announced within this fiscal year.

787
01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:44,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So that runs until March 2025.

788
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:50,548
[SPEAKER_06]: In a tweet from Nintendo Co Ltd, which is not a parody account, it is the official Nintendo company Twitter,

789
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,752
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo.

790
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:59,816
[SPEAKER_06]: We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year.

791
01:00:59,816 --> 01:01:04,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015.

792
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:04,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Nine years.

793
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:04,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

794
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:24,494
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.

795
01:01:24,494 --> 01:01:28,879
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I like that he's doing is setting the fucking expectations reasonably.

796
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:33,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's basically saying, we're gonna do an E3 Memorial Direct.

797
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so like Microsoft, who is also doing an E3 Memorial Direct, we're gonna do an E3 Memorial Direct in June, because that's what y'all are used to.

798
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:44,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So why rock the boat?

799
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:53,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But he says, do not, do not, don't expect that there's going to be a lick of information about the Nintendo Switch 2.

800
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We will announce it later.

801
01:01:56,192 --> 01:02:01,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're saying is I should expect a Switch 2 announcement.

802
01:02:01,314 --> 01:02:02,974
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want to keep me on my toes.

803
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:04,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Cue the podcasts.

804
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:06,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Cue the three hour YouTubes.

805
01:02:06,475 --> 01:02:07,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Cue it all.

806
01:02:07,175 --> 01:02:07,595
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Nintendo.

807
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:09,636
[SPEAKER_06]: They do what they want.

808
01:02:09,636 --> 01:02:16,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading into what Furukawa is saying about the Nintendo Switch 2 and what we might see in June.

809
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:18,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Switch 2 is coming out in June.

810
01:02:18,118 --> 01:02:18,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

811
01:02:18,999 --> 01:02:19,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I heard.

812
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:34,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so for the rest of you that are reasonable out there, now you know that in June they will be announcing basically what the ramp down for the Switch looks like.

813
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:38,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, is there going to be a big holiday title?

814
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:41,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Metroid Prime 4 make it for this holiday?

815
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is there another thing Nintendo's cooking?

816
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:47,834
[SPEAKER_06]: What other Wii U ports might they make?

817
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:49,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we get Xenoblade Chronicles X?

818
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we finally just finish it off and get that one too?

819
01:02:52,056 --> 01:02:53,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what else is coming?

820
01:02:54,878 --> 01:03:00,214
[SPEAKER_06]: We will find all that out in June, what the ramp down looks like, and then we'll get the new console.

821
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:05,477
[SPEAKER_06]: SSU 100 Matt says Nintendo is trying to control the narrative.

822
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:12,820
[SPEAKER_06]: They're tired of their stock taking hints and trending negatively after every direct because the switch to wasn't announced.

823
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so he's he's gonna let the stock take a hit now.

824
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:18,642
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not bringing up the switch to it will spoiler alert.

825
01:03:18,642 --> 01:03:24,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll take a hit anyway, because investors are dumb.

826
01:03:24,784 --> 01:03:26,344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's gonna.

827
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's it's gonna take a hit anyway.

828
01:03:28,325 --> 01:03:28,465
[SPEAKER_06]: But

829
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:37,469
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also an interesting kind of Q&A about, aren't you worried about cutting into the sales of the Switch by announcing the Switch 2?

830
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:41,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And you already know the answer is, nah.

831
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:46,073
[SPEAKER_06]: The Switch is strong enough that we're going to be, and we have cash on hand.

832
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: He just said that it's nine years old.

833
01:03:47,753 --> 01:03:50,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, they'll just discount it.

834
01:03:50,795 --> 01:03:52,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or possibly come out with another.

835
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, Nintendo and discount in the same sentence?

836
01:03:55,777 --> 01:03:56,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.

837
01:03:57,216 --> 01:04:24,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be a hell of a way to go with the switch a closeout sale stock up on that because Oh, the other thing that is interesting about Nintendo switch to that they did confirm is that Nintendo switch to will have physical media which we kind of knew but it is nice to sort of have that confirmed that portability still means you can have a cartridge for it.

838
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:24,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So

839
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:26,805
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

840
01:04:26,805 --> 01:04:31,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on and talk about some other headlines.

841
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:35,107
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, a gaming arena near and dear to your heart.

842
01:04:35,107 --> 01:04:36,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of them, actually.

843
01:04:36,788 --> 01:04:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

844
01:04:37,368 --> 01:04:37,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

845
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:38,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.

846
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to add it on myself, and I'm glad that you did.

847
01:04:42,109 --> 01:04:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I sort of thought of you.

848
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:49,111
[SPEAKER_03]: These are two things that I love is Dead by Daylight and Dungeons and Dragons.

849
01:04:49,111 --> 01:04:51,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I am second edition for life.

850
01:04:52,591 --> 01:04:54,071
[SPEAKER_03]: do not step to me.

851
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:57,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Your lack of THAC0 is wacko.

852
01:04:57,452 --> 01:04:59,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

853
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:00,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

854
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:00,913
[SPEAKER_03]: What Rob said.

855
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:03,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to, I'm going to make that on a shirt, Rob.

856
01:05:03,114 --> 01:05:03,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

857
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:06,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you're talking about opening up the OLR shop again.

858
01:05:06,315 --> 01:05:06,755
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

859
01:05:06,755 --> 01:05:09,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Your lack of THAC0 is wacko.

860
01:05:09,016 --> 01:05:10,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Copyright Rob Roberts.

861
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the next chapter for Dead by Daylight is going to be a D&D-themed chapter.

862
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:24,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe this one is going to have definitely a new killer.

863
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:25,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about a new survivor.

864
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:27,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to double-check the roadmap again.

865
01:05:27,754 --> 01:05:31,276
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is going to be on Tuesday.

866
01:05:31,276 --> 01:05:32,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on Tuesday?

867
01:05:32,217 --> 01:05:33,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is on Tuesday.

868
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:37,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a live conversation.

869
01:05:37,415 --> 01:05:42,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And this happens every year because we're coming up on the 8th anniversary.

870
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:46,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they go over the state of the game and gonna be talking about that.

871
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And the PTB goes live that day, the public test build.

872
01:05:51,724 --> 01:05:57,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll find out more about it, although a lot of people are already speculating that it's going to be legit Vecna.

873
01:05:58,669 --> 01:05:59,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Trailer?

874
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:02,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that look like a beholder?

875
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:09,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looked like a Beholder to me.

876
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:20,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it didn't seem like as bodily spherical as I expect a Beholder to be, but I also don't know how a Beholder would work as an enemy in Dead by Daylight.

877
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:27,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe like Sadako with telekinetically lifting people.

878
01:06:27,097 --> 01:06:28,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have Chucky.

879
01:06:29,188 --> 01:06:39,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was solved by having, you know, the ghost do all the activity for Chucky when it came to picking up and hooking people.

880
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

881
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:42,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty happy.

882
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:50,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, it was released in full behavior fashion where they put it there and then you don't get anything.

883
01:06:50,983 --> 01:06:53,245
[SPEAKER_03]: They just say when you're going to learn more.

884
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:01,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really hoping that it's as good as I hope it's going to be.

885
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I think would be funny?

886
01:07:03,455 --> 01:07:10,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that if, um, because you know, they totally want like people to buy cosmetics and shit.

887
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:18,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love it if they release cosmetics for existing survivors based off of certain D&D classes.

888
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cute.

889
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in fact, something I'm gonna do is I wanna- Paladin Dwight, please.

890
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:28,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, do you think Dwight would really be a paladin, Rob?

891
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:31,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Precious little paladin Dwight, please.

892
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:33,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Dwight would not be a fucking paladin.

893
01:07:33,433 --> 01:07:37,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Dwight would be a jester.

894
01:07:37,457 --> 01:07:39,539
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the bard would be Kate.

895
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:40,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, fair.

896
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Meg would be a flop.

897
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:45,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

898
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,478
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Meg is awesome.

899
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:48,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You shush.

900
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

901
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I was just I just want to say real quick about the the Vecna speculation.

902
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:56,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes a lot of sense.

903
01:07:56,485 --> 01:08:03,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's completely in line with and we have seen DBD do this multiple times to get the license they really want.

904
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,751
[SPEAKER_06]: They license it in creative ways.

905
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:07,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Ghostface is the best example of that.

906
01:08:07,894 --> 01:08:13,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Nowhere in DVD is the word scream in the context of the film ever mentioned.

907
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,223
[SPEAKER_06]: DB Ghostface.

908
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: They even changed the name, his original perk names because of it.

909
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:18,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

910
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:18,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.

911
01:08:18,925 --> 01:08:29,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, um, the, uh, name that you read the background of the character, it's not any of the killers from scream because what they did, they licensed the same costume that the movie did.

912
01:08:29,512 --> 01:08:34,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then Sadako you mentioned that's a license of the book series, not the movie.

913
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:34,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

914
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:35,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

915
01:08:35,456 --> 01:08:35,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Incorrect.

916
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:37,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was the book, the ring of books.

917
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:38,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

918
01:08:38,297 --> 01:08:38,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

919
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:40,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a license of the Japanese movie.

920
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:40,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,

921
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:42,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, still.

922
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:46,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the books, that's still quite a bit different.

923
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:46,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

924
01:08:46,767 --> 01:08:57,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big thing they can't get away with with trying to do licensing for the US one is the fact that the main antagonist in the American version was a young girl.

925
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Where Sadako canonically was a 19 year old intersex woman who had worked as an actress, killed everybody.

926
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:11,473
[SPEAKER_03]: She inherited her mother's psychic abilities and her father locked her in the well and killed her.

927
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:14,468
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

928
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:17,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I know my Ring fandom very well.

929
01:09:30,612 --> 01:09:34,436
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know the Legion kids were, you know, freaking in high school.

930
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The comic even has them as high school kids.

931
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:41,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, which the Legion comic is fucking great.

932
01:09:41,282 --> 01:09:42,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But we knew we all knew.

933
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:47,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what actually makes I think the characters a little bit more sinister than they are.

934
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:52,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the comic really made me feel a lot, a lot sadder for Susie.

935
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:53,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll still going back.

936
01:09:53,753 --> 01:09:54,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go ahead.

937
01:09:56,068 --> 01:10:04,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll still be interesting to see what the door opening with Dungeons & Dragons and really Hasbro in general could lead to in the future for Dead by Daylight.

938
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:05,754
[SPEAKER_05]: The Monopoly Man.

939
01:10:05,754 --> 01:10:08,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the Monopoly Man.

940
01:10:08,515 --> 01:10:14,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking Magic the Gathering.

941
01:10:14,179 --> 01:10:14,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

942
01:10:14,879 --> 01:10:20,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, keep in mind, whenever I think of D&D, I look at its current logo and go, that's not right.

943
01:10:21,232 --> 01:10:24,594
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm my my D&D brain is back in the TSR days.

944
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:25,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to leave it at that.

945
01:10:25,714 --> 01:10:26,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

946
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But but I see a lot.

947
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:35,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would be really funny if they went with cartoon, but I know that that wouldn't play into this.

948
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:40,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would love to see just the Dungeons and Dragons movie.

949
01:10:40,521 --> 01:10:43,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get a what's his name?

950
01:10:43,363 --> 01:10:47,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's really more what I'm thinking it's going to go with.

951
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:47,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

952
01:10:49,337 --> 01:11:01,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and there are some, like, sort of fantasy cosmetics that are already in the game, like Claudette's and Feng's, like, ranger and botanist outfits and whatnot.

953
01:11:01,603 --> 01:11:05,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have the knight as the killer, so, you know, there's... We do.

954
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:08,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that Claudette would be a druid.

955
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:09,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna say that now.

956
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:10,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Claudette would be a druid.

957
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:11,528
[SPEAKER_06]: That does make sense.

958
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:13,949
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have another theory.

959
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:34,165
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is going back to an announcement they were doing about improvements to the invocation perk where it came with Sable, where she goes in the basement and chants and the more people who join her little magic circle, the faster it goes, which is a rad concept for a perk like summoning demons together.

960
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's a fucking rad concept for a perk.

961
01:11:37,216 --> 01:11:42,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was taking two minutes and they reduced it to one minute then with all the other improvements.

962
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:48,408
[SPEAKER_03]: What if we get like a mage as a survivor?

963
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:51,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a flat-out fucking mage.

964
01:11:51,351 --> 01:11:52,252
[SPEAKER_06]: As a survivor.

965
01:11:52,252 --> 01:11:54,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love the ability to summon a bot.

966
01:11:56,728 --> 01:11:58,490
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an invocation.

967
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:03,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not even saying like summon, you know, a creature or something like that.

968
01:12:03,313 --> 01:12:07,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, summoning a bot would be great, but I had another conversation with a friend.

969
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:23,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was in Nick's chat not long ago about having the killer be a mimic and have them fulfill the original idea of Legion that you couldn't tell that it was a survivor.

970
01:12:25,283 --> 01:12:29,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and that was that was the twist in VHS as well, wasn't it?

971
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:29,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

972
01:12:29,706 --> 01:12:30,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

973
01:12:30,147 --> 01:12:30,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

974
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:36,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if you have a mimic and, you know, they flat out look like one of the other survivors?

975
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:39,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't.

976
01:12:39,597 --> 01:12:48,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would have to be someone who was in the lobby with you and you're screwed if you, you know, came with a shroud or something.

977
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:53,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know that they have no terror radius until they start chasing.

978
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:55,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like their power is just no terror radius.

979
01:12:55,895 --> 01:12:58,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And they turn into a mimic.

980
01:12:58,238 --> 01:12:58,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you imagine?

981
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:13,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd have to be, like, play along the same lines of, like, you know, Ghostface or Myers, you know, with just that stalky pretend thing.

982
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,764
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thought.

983
01:13:14,764 --> 01:13:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'd like to see.

984
01:13:15,704 --> 01:13:16,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Copyright, Jamie.

985
01:13:16,905 --> 01:13:17,246
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

986
01:13:17,246 --> 01:13:25,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll get more information on Tuesday, and I'm sure DarkSakura will be probably... No, you can't do PTB still, huh?

987
01:13:25,253 --> 01:13:26,514
[SPEAKER_06]: But you'll be talking about it if not.

988
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:34,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to watch people... I mean, unless I magically get teleported to PC to do PTB, then no.

989
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried so hard to get it to work through GeForce, but because you have to switch... Like, I've switched stuff to PTB, and tried to get it to reload, and still nothing.

990
01:13:44,701 --> 01:13:45,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

991
01:13:51,286 --> 01:14:03,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually really excited about this, plus I like that they're putting back in those little modes that they teased about in some of the surveys that went out.

992
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:08,512
[SPEAKER_03]: They were really freaking fun, and seeing them in practice just makes me really, really happy about it.

993
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:11,331
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

994
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:15,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, quick sidetrack, Jinx, Monsoon, and Doctor Who.

995
01:14:15,232 --> 01:14:17,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I said that earlier.

996
01:14:17,313 --> 01:14:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

997
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:18,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

998
01:14:18,213 --> 01:14:19,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But I watched the scene.

999
01:14:19,274 --> 01:14:21,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you?

1000
01:14:21,154 --> 01:14:23,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jinx, Monsoon, and Doctor Who.

1001
01:14:23,935 --> 01:14:24,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy.

1002
01:14:24,996 --> 01:14:26,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1003
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:30,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of new Doctor Who fans all of a sudden with everything they're doing this season.

1004
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:32,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So good times.

1005
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:33,458
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1006
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:38,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, I guess, back on Nintendo for a little bit.

1007
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:38,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1008
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:56,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so there was a comment by Nigel Laurie of Devolver Digital talking about how they feel that indie games do much better on the Switch than other consoles because Nintendo has cultivated a player base that's more open to interesting concepts and smaller games.

1009
01:14:57,032 --> 01:15:05,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has created an ecosystem and therefore a user base that is really open to interesting concepts and gameplay ideas.

1010
01:15:05,237 --> 01:15:20,345
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation and Xbox users, for as long as I've been doing this, there's been a lot of people that still like indie games, don't get me wrong, Cole Lamb has done very well on those platforms, but I think the large majority of those people buy those platforms to show off what they can really do.

1011
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I think platforms themselves are really strong believers in indie games.

1012
01:15:25,848 --> 01:15:27,129
[SPEAKER_05]: They really do push them.

1013
01:15:27,129 --> 01:15:41,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I think on our end, or on the other end, the consumers, as big as they might be, there's still a smaller portion that we would like on Xbox and PlayStation that are open to looking at a pixel art platform or going, I'll give this a shot.

1014
01:15:42,586 --> 01:15:54,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that may be somewhat true, but I also think, too, that cost is a little bit of that, because if you look at like a lot of games that are on Switch, they don't ever get reduced in price.

1015
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, at least first party titles don't.

1016
01:15:57,258 --> 01:16:02,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have a lot of this like, hey, my kid wants a new game to play.

1017
01:16:02,442 --> 01:16:02,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

1018
01:16:03,595 --> 01:16:06,018
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1019
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:23,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Smaller games or shorter games might be also more popular because you can take it with you and play it as you go.

1020
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:29,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that's a huge part of it, is that for those games that are multi-platform, I know a lot of people personally that make this decision.

1021
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:42,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't always make the decision this way, but I know others that do that go, oh, well, OK, if I want to get Little Kitty, Big City and it's on PlayStation 5, Xbox and Switch, you know, I'm going to get the Switch version because that way I'll have it on the go.

1022
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I can have it portable because Sony and Microsoft don't have portable systems, at least not today.

1023
01:16:47,905 --> 01:16:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We see Microsoft.

1024
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:51,806
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of rumors about Microsoft want to get in that space.

1025
01:16:51,806 --> 01:17:02,769
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, certainly, you know, things like the Nvidia shield and things like that, you know, kind of get in Steam Deck, I guess, kind of getting in that space, but nothing, nothing with the volume of the switch.

1026
01:17:02,769 --> 01:17:09,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that honestly, I think a big part of it is as simple as that, is that you feel like there's an extra perk to buying on the switch.

1027
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:12,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is, oh, I can play this on the go as well as on the TV.

1028
01:17:13,871 --> 01:17:15,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1029
01:17:15,853 --> 01:17:17,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1030
01:17:17,534 --> 01:17:18,214
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1031
01:17:18,214 --> 01:17:24,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, moving on, let's talk to this is another follow up in the Nintendo series.

1032
01:17:24,459 --> 01:17:26,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And we talked about this last week.

1033
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:32,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was confirmed that Nintendo World Championships is a game that is coming.

1034
01:17:32,846 --> 01:17:34,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming in July.

1035
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:37,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Nintendo World Championships NES edition.

1036
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is

1037
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:54,883
[SPEAKER_06]: This is pretty, oops, sorry, I'm gonna, sorry for the little volume that came through there, but sometimes I don't have my YouTubes completely prepared in advance, but I wanna show this on the second screen, because for those that haven't seen it, there's a whole little trailer that goes along, I'd like to welcome you all, be quiet.

1038
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:58,706
[SPEAKER_06]: A little second, a little trailer that goes along with this.

1039
01:17:58,706 --> 01:18:03,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first half of it is just like interviewing a bunch of people that did the Nintendo World Championships before.

1040
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:07,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, like halfway through the trailer, we actually get into,

1041
01:18:08,174 --> 01:18:21,282
[SPEAKER_06]: the actual gameplay itself, which will hopefully load for those of you that are watching live at some point, but I'm going to move on and talk about what is actually in this, because there's a bunch of games that are in it.

1042
01:18:21,282 --> 01:18:26,845
[SPEAKER_06]: 13 classic NES games that are in this, including Balloon Fight.

1043
01:18:26,845 --> 01:18:28,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why it keeps buffering, guys.

1044
01:18:28,146 --> 01:18:30,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1045
01:18:30,787 --> 01:18:33,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, now Loki standing up when I went cut to the screen.

1046
01:18:36,452 --> 01:18:39,013
[SPEAKER_06]: The video keeps buffering over here and I don't know why.

1047
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:42,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I need to take down the quality or something and maybe it'll play better.

1048
01:18:42,795 --> 01:18:43,795
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1049
01:18:43,795 --> 01:18:46,877
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, 13 games that are going to be in this.

1050
01:18:46,877 --> 01:18:58,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Excitebike, Ice Climber, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure, Metroid, Mario 1, 2, and 3, Mario Lost Levels, The Legend of Zelda, and Zelda 2, The Adventure of Link.

1051
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:01,703
[SPEAKER_06]: 150 speedrun challenges.

1052
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,425
[SPEAKER_06]: You can warm up by doing, I guess,

1053
01:19:05,645 --> 01:19:19,209
[SPEAKER_06]: You set and beat your own times in the single-player speedrun mode, and then you unlock new challenges and unique in-game pins along the way, and then up to eight players can actually compete locally in party mode.

1054
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:31,192
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a Nintendo Switch Online member, you can do the World Championship mode to submit your best times in five challenges that rotate each week!

1055
01:19:31,192 --> 01:19:32,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, assholes!

1056
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:34,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I called it last week!

1057
01:19:35,506 --> 01:19:40,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I not say this would be, wouldn't this be the stretch goal for Nintendo?

1058
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:53,290
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have different versions of the little cartridge and they could actually rotate every week and you'd have a little leaderboard that you could actually compete against your friends.

1059
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking nailed it last week.

1060
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my tiara?

1061
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:59,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my crown?

1062
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:00,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my cult?

1063
01:20:00,852 --> 01:20:02,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm predicting the future over here, people.

1064
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:05,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Rob Stradamus.

1065
01:20:05,526 --> 01:20:09,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1066
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:09,727
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1067
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1068
01:20:10,068 --> 01:20:11,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take my flowers.

1069
01:20:11,048 --> 01:20:12,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

1070
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:16,589
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, I've been wanting them to revisit the idea of NES Remix.

1071
01:20:16,589 --> 01:20:18,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's about what this is sounding like.

1072
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.

1073
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:26,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, DarkTetsuya says, I'm kind of excited for this, especially now that we know what it is.

1074
01:20:26,452 --> 01:20:29,653
[SPEAKER_06]: PodCulture said, would Rob knock Bobby off the leaderboard?

1075
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:33,556
[SPEAKER_06]: hopefully, but we'll see.

1076
01:20:33,556 --> 01:20:33,896
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1077
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:37,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends what the games are actually is would be my real answer to that.

1078
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, those those sons of bitches did it.

1079
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:42,382
[SPEAKER_06]: They really got an online version of this.

1080
01:20:42,382 --> 01:20:46,946
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna be able to compete against your friends and the challenges rotate like they ought to.

1081
01:20:46,946 --> 01:20:49,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it says there's 13 games in it.

1082
01:20:49,087 --> 01:20:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: But but but what if they added more?

1083
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:55,551
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have?

1084
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:56,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um, it's a

1085
01:21:18,483 --> 01:21:26,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this dead thing that no one plays anymore that just serves to make us feel- I'm just kidding, it's DDR!

1086
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:37,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami announced that there is going to be a new DDR series, Dance Dance Revolution World, so a new version of the game.

1087
01:21:37,113 --> 01:21:42,796
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't any, like, date announced or any of the features, but

1088
01:21:45,177 --> 01:21:46,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the style.

1089
01:21:46,098 --> 01:21:50,981
[SPEAKER_03]: The style of it is very on the lines of like the 2DX styling, I think.

1090
01:21:50,981 --> 01:21:52,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has Emi and Rage on it.

1091
01:21:52,702 --> 01:21:58,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hey, welcome back from the abyss, you two.

1092
01:21:58,306 --> 01:22:06,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think it's funny that like on this little ad, Rage on one of his little pouches has the old feet.

1093
01:22:06,611 --> 01:22:12,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that right off the bat, too, that he has the little maniac, maniac sticker for the old difficulty.

1094
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:13,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

1095
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:17,409
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently Emmy's underwear says Emmy.

1096
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you know, she needs a belt anyway.

1097
01:22:22,033 --> 01:22:29,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be replacing the Revolution A3 cabinets with world once they have it released.

1098
01:22:29,638 --> 01:22:37,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're leaving the A-verse behind because I think they just did a twenty

1099
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: A20 Plus and A3 were the last two, right?

1100
01:22:44,174 --> 01:22:47,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we'll see what happens.

1101
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:51,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't forget, there's also that DDR Classic Mini.

1102
01:22:51,235 --> 01:22:51,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1103
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:53,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one fifth the size.

1104
01:22:53,476 --> 01:22:54,616
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

1105
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:59,297
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, well, when we know more, y'all will know more.

1106
01:22:59,297 --> 01:23:05,218
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite is that this is called DDR World, but there's sure to be features that will only be available in Japan.

1107
01:23:05,218 --> 01:23:07,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1108
01:23:07,459 --> 01:23:08,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1109
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:08,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1110
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:17,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's not available in most countries, actually, from all the feedback has been seen online from some local players.

1111
01:23:17,486 --> 01:23:26,632
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can have a World Series baseball that only encompasses the United States and Canada, then they can have a World DDR.

1112
01:23:26,632 --> 01:23:28,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1113
01:23:28,273 --> 01:23:28,973
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1114
01:23:28,973 --> 01:23:32,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides that, Japanese baseball players would kick all of our asses.

1115
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: World written in lowercase.

1116
01:23:34,076 --> 01:23:34,377
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1117
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:37,839
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

1118
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:38,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1119
01:23:40,283 --> 01:23:55,947
[SPEAKER_05]: uh yes uh so the nintendo switch is going to be discontinuing support for um x or twitter um no one fucking calls it x i i i know i i know um stupid business ventures

1120
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:13,266
[SPEAKER_05]: As of June 10th, you will no longer be able to post screenshots and videos to Twitter from the Nintendo Switch's album or send friend requests to social media users via friend suggestions.

1121
01:24:13,266 --> 01:24:22,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You can thank Elon Musk for this, for raising the cost of the Enterprise Tier API access, which is $42,000 a month.

1122
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:35,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And if, you know, considering that there's probably not many people using this feature, it doesn't make sense to pay this much to support this feature that not a lot of people are using.

1123
01:24:35,421 --> 01:24:38,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1124
01:24:38,103 --> 01:24:44,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, yeah, you can still download the pictures and upload them to social media that way, but it's certainly not as easy.

1125
01:24:44,588 --> 01:24:45,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's kind of a pain.

1126
01:24:45,929 --> 01:24:53,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So and I believe Facebook will still be an option, too, because I think you can I know you can add friends through Facebook and I think you can share it to Facebook that way as well.

1127
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,934
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1128
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:14,759
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

1129
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:37,787
[SPEAKER_06]: dragged and dropped into the browser window and shared the screenshot that way.

1130
01:25:37,787 --> 01:25:43,090
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's it's pretty easy to download the pictures to your phone because the switch can set up like that now.

1131
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:44,511
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that some time ago.

1132
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:46,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't blame Nintendo.

1133
01:25:46,092 --> 01:25:47,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Why spend that kind of money?

1134
01:25:47,092 --> 01:25:50,214
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I thank them for not spending that money.

1135
01:25:50,214 --> 01:25:50,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1136
01:25:50,714 --> 01:25:54,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I mean, like, yeah, it's just.

1137
01:25:54,376 --> 01:26:00,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just maybe they'll have something new on the next Nintendo Switch console thing, you know?

1138
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:00,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1139
01:26:01,144 --> 01:26:04,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they're smart, they'll have their own social media thing.

1140
01:26:04,048 --> 01:26:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not talking about... Oh, God, what was it called on the Wii U?

1141
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:10,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking... Wii-verse?

1142
01:26:10,175 --> 01:26:10,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Miiverse?

1143
01:26:10,876 --> 01:26:13,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Miiverse.

1144
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,321
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe I am talking about Miiverse a little bit.

1145
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1146
01:26:18,602 --> 01:26:26,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Miiverse, unfortunately, will not be making its way to the Video Game Hall of Fame anytime soon, but we know the five games that will be.

1147
01:26:26,069 --> 01:26:39,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So, selected for the Video Game Hall of Fame, which is hosted at the Strong National Museum of Play, the five candidates that will be inducted will be Ultima,

1148
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:46,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Mist, Asteroids, Resident Evil, and SimCity.

1149
01:26:46,310 --> 01:27:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I seem to recall that we had done like a fantasy league for this at some point on the show, but I could not, for the life of me, find the document that we had done that night to figure out what we had predicted in that category.

1150
01:27:06,377 --> 01:27:09,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we had our own Hall of Fame that we inducted things.

1151
01:27:09,538 --> 01:27:10,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1152
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:11,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly, possibly.

1153
01:27:11,498 --> 01:27:27,063
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say the games that did not make it that were on the shortlist were Elite, Guitar Hero, Metroid, Neopets, Tokimeki Memorial, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and You Don't Know Jack were the games that did not make it.

1154
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:27,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1155
01:27:29,598 --> 01:27:30,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1156
01:27:48,254 --> 01:27:49,435
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1157
01:27:49,435 --> 01:27:51,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I'd love to go visit that museum someday.

1158
01:27:51,596 --> 01:27:53,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's in Rochester, New York.

1159
01:27:53,597 --> 01:27:56,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to go to upstate New York to go visit it.

1160
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So what else is out there?

1161
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I could go to Niagara Falls while I'm out there.

1162
01:28:02,622 --> 01:28:07,865
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why they that's why they put like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland to get you to visit Cleveland.

1163
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So what can you do?

1164
01:28:09,426 --> 01:28:10,367
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1165
01:28:10,367 --> 01:28:12,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, SSJ 100 Matt's up there now.

1166
01:28:12,808 --> 01:28:14,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1167
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess we could take a trip.

1168
01:28:15,571 --> 01:28:18,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We could take a trip together to the video game museum.

1169
01:28:18,695 --> 01:28:19,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1170
01:28:19,095 --> 01:28:21,077
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1171
01:28:21,077 --> 01:28:29,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of classic games, we have a segment here on this show where we induct games into our own Hall of Fame every single week in this segment.

1172
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:47,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1173
01:28:47,909 --> 01:28:52,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1174
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:53,355
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1175
01:28:53,355 --> 01:28:59,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some reason, I don't have the B-roll queued up, but I will get that while DarkSakura tells us what she picked for the classic game this week.

1176
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:04,651
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic game is one that came out in 2008.

1177
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:08,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a puzzle platform game called Tag, The Power of Paint.

1178
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:12,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that sounds familiar, stay tuned and I'll tell you why.

1179
01:29:12,856 --> 01:29:19,741
[SPEAKER_03]: It was developed for Windows by Tag Team, which is a group of students from DigiPen Institute of Technology.

1180
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:21,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, something else that should sound familiar.

1181
01:29:22,302 --> 01:29:32,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you have to go through these grayscale cell shaded areas with paint.

1182
01:29:32,248 --> 01:29:37,312
[SPEAKER_03]: You start off with green paint that lets you bounce off of things, but then you can find the cans for other colors.

1183
01:29:38,192 --> 01:29:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have like a paint eraser.

1184
01:29:40,553 --> 01:29:46,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll get red next, which causes you to quickly gain momentum.

1185
01:29:46,836 --> 01:29:52,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And then blue lets you walk on any surfaces, be it vertical, be it a ceiling, whatever.

1186
01:29:54,039 --> 01:30:01,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have to use the combinations of these different physics to be able to reach the checkpoint.

1187
01:30:01,584 --> 01:30:04,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really is just that simple of a concept.

1188
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:12,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It was developed by seven students for their course at DigiPen Institute of Technology.

1189
01:30:12,892 --> 01:30:16,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took about 18 months to create.

1190
01:30:16,475 --> 01:30:18,636
[SPEAKER_03]: They wrote a game engine from scratch.

1191
01:30:20,338 --> 01:30:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to create the physics, and they started by, you know, going through this version of tag, like playground tag, to paint over, like paint to tag other players, but they dropped that because the different mechanics would have

1192
01:30:42,287 --> 01:30:46,108
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been less enjoyable than the actual tagging.

1193
01:30:46,108 --> 01:30:54,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had some power-ups in there, and then they actually just started going with the paint itself as the power-up.

1194
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, getting the different paints and seeing how they work together.

1195
01:31:00,035 --> 01:31:15,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really listened to feedback as they developed it, and then the game was done, and they were able to submit it to the Independence Game Festival, and then said that once they had more funding, they'd do a more professional version.

1196
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:19,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So the game was actually released on Steam, actually, April 18, 2022.

1197
01:31:22,659 --> 01:31:27,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But the original version was 2008, so it counts.

1198
01:31:27,683 --> 01:31:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It won the student competition at the Independent Games Festival in 2009.

1199
01:31:32,807 --> 01:31:37,951
[SPEAKER_03]: They were completely lauded by industry professionals.

1200
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:43,935
[SPEAKER_03]: The music went over very well, the complexity of the puzzles, the way the graphics integrated with the mechanics.

1201
01:31:47,578 --> 01:31:55,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It was considered to be, and this is a quote, a compelling piece of puzzle design.

1202
01:31:55,241 --> 01:32:09,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, GameSpot actually said that it seemed like the game was a cross between Portal and Mirror's Edge and found it simple yet, you know, well integrated.

1203
01:32:09,547 --> 01:32:12,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So now here's where things get familiar.

1204
01:32:13,672 --> 01:32:23,423
[SPEAKER_03]: The programmers were hired by Valve to incorporate their puzzle elements into a game that they were working on the time, Portal 2.

1205
01:32:24,946 --> 01:32:35,375
[SPEAKER_03]: just the same way that Valve went to the DigiPen students who did Narbacular Drop to help create Portal.

1206
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:39,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sensing a theme.

1207
01:32:39,058 --> 01:32:47,145
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, the group that made this game were brought on to work on Portal 2.

1208
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why

1209
01:32:52,150 --> 01:33:00,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why everyone should find this whole game concept or even the game itself very familiar.

1210
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:02,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1211
01:33:02,584 --> 01:33:03,145
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1212
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:05,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had no idea what this was when I first read the name.

1213
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:08,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I saw the video, I was like, Oh, that's right.

1214
01:33:08,772 --> 01:33:08,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1215
01:33:10,697 --> 01:33:24,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even in this little clip here, you know, with, uh, you know, doing bouncing and everything and, and, you know, sliding around all this is missing as a portal, you know?

1216
01:33:24,742 --> 01:33:25,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.

1217
01:33:25,863 --> 01:33:27,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it's kind of neat.

1218
01:33:27,303 --> 01:33:30,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Wall jumping mechanics, everything.

1219
01:33:30,124 --> 01:33:38,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of neat how Valve finds these very indie college built titles and sort of, you know, puts them into their, you know, essentially AAA games.

1220
01:33:38,828 --> 01:33:39,308
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

1221
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:44,790
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1222
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:49,193
[SPEAKER_08]: There is your classic game of the week tag.

1223
01:33:49,193 --> 01:33:52,115
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the subtitle on that?

1224
01:33:52,115 --> 01:33:53,296
[SPEAKER_08]: The Power of Paint.

1225
01:33:53,296 --> 01:33:54,757
[SPEAKER_08]: The Power of Paint.

1226
01:33:54,757 --> 01:33:54,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1227
01:33:56,739 --> 01:33:58,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's move on.

1228
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some more news for y'all.

1229
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll be taking your calls.

1230
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:03,622
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have any tonight.

1231
01:34:03,622 --> 01:34:04,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Emails and all that good stuff.

1232
01:34:04,942 --> 01:34:09,304
[SPEAKER_06]: VOGnetwork.com slash discord is where you can join us and chat throughout the week.

1233
01:34:09,304 --> 01:34:14,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at Orangelandradio.com is where you can send us emails if you like.

1234
01:34:14,046 --> 01:34:18,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do some rapid fire news and talk about quickly some other headlines going on in the gaming space.

1235
01:34:18,328 --> 01:34:19,188
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Loki first.

1236
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been some rumors that apparently a LEGO and Sony collaboration is in the works and about to be announced very soon.

1237
01:34:29,826 --> 01:34:41,593
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Tom Henderson, who is an industry insider, says, I know something, or I'm not particularly fond of the I know something and you don't vague insider BS, but from what I

1238
01:34:42,514 --> 01:34:55,770
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there is a LEGO Horizon trailer that's ready to go, which makes sense because there was a LEGO Horizon set that I actually have on my computer right now.

1239
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, maybe we'll see that very soon.

1240
01:34:58,857 --> 01:35:14,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you're a fan of classic FPS games, Marathon, a very classic Bungie title, is now available on Steam for free.

1241
01:35:14,347 --> 01:35:18,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can go get that.

1242
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:23,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And play it to your heart's content.

1243
01:35:23,213 --> 01:35:24,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

1244
01:35:24,614 --> 01:35:27,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Until the new one comes out.

1245
01:35:27,796 --> 01:35:28,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever that might be.

1246
01:35:30,799 --> 01:35:33,300
[SPEAKER_08]: late 2025.

1247
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,902
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1248
01:35:35,902 --> 01:35:43,026
[SPEAKER_06]: You think it'll actually make 2025 and not get delayed?

1249
01:35:43,026 --> 01:35:45,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, who's who's publishing it?

1250
01:35:45,468 --> 01:35:46,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Bungie that's doing it?

1251
01:35:46,909 --> 01:35:47,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.

1252
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:56,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I could see them saying that they need to allocate resources to Destiny 3 or live service games or something like that.

1253
01:35:56,886 --> 01:36:00,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And so therefore they can't marathon will be a live service game to that.

1254
01:36:00,669 --> 01:36:04,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I guess we can ruin it further.

1255
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:05,733
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1256
01:36:05,733 --> 01:36:06,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

1257
01:36:06,814 --> 01:36:11,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this this was another one where when I saw this headline, I was like, Oh, DarkSakura wants to talk about this on OLR.

1258
01:36:12,878 --> 01:36:23,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so another series I'm super fond of is Cotton, and Cotton reboot High Tension has been announced for Switch.

1259
01:36:23,186 --> 01:36:31,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be released, they're saying Spring 2025 in Japan, and it's a sequel to the previous Cotton reboot.

1260
01:36:32,633 --> 01:36:35,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some character designs released.

1261
01:36:35,436 --> 01:36:41,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a new playable character called Makaron and a villain named Willow.

1262
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:50,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a voice cast, casting auditions going out right now.

1263
01:36:50,129 --> 01:36:51,050
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1264
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:51,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1265
01:36:52,953 --> 01:36:54,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like it'll be fun.

1266
01:36:54,974 --> 01:36:55,595
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1267
01:36:55,595 --> 01:36:59,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's talk about a game that I think has been brought up on the show before.

1268
01:36:59,857 --> 01:37:07,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a game that Alan actually introduced me to because when he was streaming, he hasn't streamed in a little while, but when he was streaming, he used to do music games on Monday.

1269
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:15,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And almost just in time for his birthday, because this is right around his birthday, Spin Rhythm XD is getting released for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, the

1270
01:37:16,946 --> 01:37:23,310
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation VR 2, that should be interesting, and SteamVR, and that's all coming out on July 9th.

1271
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:26,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is coming out from Super Spin Digital.

1272
01:37:26,672 --> 01:37:41,481
[SPEAKER_06]: A free update that will add virtual reality support to the existing PC or Steam version will also be available on the Steam date, on the same date, and that's going to be very interesting as well because that's the one that a lot of people have hacked, modded, etc.

1273
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:44,783
[SPEAKER_06]: to add their own songs, but we don't, we're not supposed to talk about that openly.

1274
01:37:46,664 --> 01:37:49,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Download Content Pack with 10 new tracks and skins for all available platforms!

1275
01:38:15,023 --> 01:38:17,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, spin rhythm.

1276
01:38:17,245 --> 01:38:22,709
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner than that.

1277
01:38:22,709 --> 01:38:28,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Some games coming out this week in May in world release dates starting with the US, Loki.

1278
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:39,803
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Homeworld 3 on PC, Braid Anniversary Edition on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, iOS, and Android.

1279
01:38:40,789 --> 01:39:06,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Biomutant on Nintendo Switch, Neptunia Game Maker R Evolution on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Beladins on PC, Ghosts of Tsushima Director's Cut on PC, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes on PC and Nintendo Switch, and RoboBeat on PC.

1280
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:16,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, let's travel over to Japan and check out what is coming out there now that we finally have Golden Week behind us.

1281
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:22,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're starting to get some releases again, including on the Nintendo Switch, we have Biomutant comes out on the 14th.

1282
01:39:22,962 --> 01:39:26,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have on the Switch Garden Life, a cozy simulator on the 16th.

1283
01:39:28,326 --> 01:39:29,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloodstained Ritual of the Night

1284
01:39:44,475 --> 01:39:49,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Garden Life, a cozy simulator, is also coming out on the 16th, and that's really the only release.

1285
01:39:49,758 --> 01:39:54,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it still is kind of a slow week, even now being on the other side of Golden Week.

1286
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,281
[SPEAKER_06]: But things ramp up again next week.

1287
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:58,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have Paper Mario next week, so things start to ramp up again.

1288
01:39:58,302 --> 01:40:02,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in the meantime, let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.

1289
01:40:02,565 --> 01:40:04,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It is pretty slow there, too.

1290
01:40:04,026 --> 01:40:07,287
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 14th, for Switch, we have Biomutant.

1291
01:40:07,287 --> 01:40:10,309
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 16th, we have, for Switch and PlayStation, Pool Party.

1292
01:40:11,502 --> 01:40:16,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the 17th for the three consoles, we have My Little Pony, a Zephyr Heights mystery.

1293
01:40:16,747 --> 01:40:21,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, also, Slave Zero X for PlayStation and Switch.

1294
01:40:21,451 --> 01:40:22,572
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1295
01:40:22,572 --> 01:40:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

1296
01:40:23,233 --> 01:40:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: We have just a few more stories for you.

1297
01:40:24,734 --> 01:40:26,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll get to what you guys want to talk about.

1298
01:40:26,897 --> 01:40:29,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had an announcement of an announcement.

1299
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:31,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we have an update to address an update, right, Loki?

1300
01:40:32,296 --> 01:40:47,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, well this is very appropriate coming from Bethesda because their last update that they did to add more performance enhancements to Fallout 4 and better graphics

1301
01:40:49,705 --> 01:40:53,867
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't quite do a lot and broke a lot of things.

1302
01:40:53,867 --> 01:41:03,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now they have a new update coming out on the 13th, which is going to be updating Fallout 4 on all platforms.

1303
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:09,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And this update will include new options for graphics and performance settings, as well as further fixes and improvements.

1304
01:41:09,593 --> 01:41:16,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, breaking the mods I'm going to play on the game.

1305
01:41:16,816 --> 01:41:17,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1306
01:41:17,596 --> 01:41:18,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1307
01:41:18,337 --> 01:41:18,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Please stop.

1308
01:41:23,689 --> 01:41:44,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, one more story for you and it has to do with something else that Sarah Bond talked about in that Bloomberg interview that didn't get as much coverage as that other quote that we played earlier in the show, but she also mentioned that Microsoft is launching a web-based store to download mobile games and get add-ons and in-app purchases and all of that.

1309
01:41:45,527 --> 01:41:53,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've decided to do it as a browser store instead of an app to make it, quote, accessible across all devices, all countries, no matter what.

1310
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:57,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not in a single ecosystem or what have you.

1311
01:41:57,772 --> 01:42:02,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And Microsoft will only have its own games to begin with.

1312
01:42:02,214 --> 01:42:05,995
[SPEAKER_06]: That means probably Activision Blizzard as well, because that's part of Microsoft now.

1313
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:06,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1314
01:42:08,516 --> 01:42:13,160
[SPEAKER_06]: You might also recall that Activision Blizzard included King and what did King make?

1315
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy Crush.

1316
01:42:14,481 --> 01:42:22,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure that's going to be a big part of this store as well, which might also be a big part of why they bought Activision Blizzard King in the first place.

1317
01:42:22,207 --> 01:42:24,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see how that goes.

1318
01:42:24,248 --> 01:42:33,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Minecraft is also suggested as one of the first games you'll be able to get, which does make a lot of sense that they would, you know, have that on mobile phones as well, and have that available in their store.

1319
01:42:34,856 --> 01:43:02,088
[SPEAKER_06]: a spokesperson from Xbox said this is just the first step in the journey to building a trusted app store with its roots in gaming which sounds like the most generic thing I've ever heard or something of this nature but it is doing a thing and we're going to see more of these stores open up as the whole EU digital market acts or DMA's rules went into effect and we know Epic's planning their own thing and so on and so on so we'll see if Microsoft's store is

1320
01:43:04,056 --> 01:43:05,017
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be worth the visit.

1321
01:43:05,017 --> 01:43:08,740
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have to be honest, none of those things sound particularly exciting to me.

1322
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:11,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not a candy crush person.

1323
01:43:11,402 --> 01:43:14,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I think games like Minecraft are better left to devices.

1324
01:43:14,304 --> 01:43:18,747
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess Minecraft always had, you know, Minecraft had a huge audience on iPad.

1325
01:43:18,747 --> 01:43:20,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do I know?

1326
01:43:20,408 --> 01:43:26,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I feel like a lot of those games are just better left to something with a tangible input device and not so much the touchscreen.

1327
01:43:26,753 --> 01:43:32,298
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Microsoft would invent something for touchscreen mobile, then maybe I'd be a little more excited.

1328
01:43:32,918 --> 01:43:37,940
[SPEAKER_06]: But wasn't Minecraft World, what the hell did they call that Minecraft AR game?

1329
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:38,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Minecraft Earth.

1330
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Minecraft Earth.

1331
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:43,741
[SPEAKER_06]: They let that have a good like six months, then they killed that, didn't they?

1332
01:43:43,741 --> 01:43:44,802
[SPEAKER_06]: That was disappointing.

1333
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:48,363
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't very long, which is too bad, because I think there was some potential there.

1334
01:43:48,363 --> 01:43:53,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It was still a little bit janky, but they did have like a lot of unique.

1335
01:43:53,004 --> 01:43:55,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty, it was OK.

1336
01:43:55,965 --> 01:43:58,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was kind of fun to mess around with.

1337
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:04,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a bit early and ambitious.

1338
01:44:04,091 --> 01:44:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing that I am most upset about with that is they have a ton of assets that they created for that game that they're literally just sitting on and not doing anything with them.

1339
01:44:13,133 --> 01:44:16,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, can you please just put them in the vanilla game?

1340
01:44:16,174 --> 01:44:20,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, honestly, like you have all this stuff done.

1341
01:44:20,815 --> 01:44:22,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Just put it in the game.

1342
01:44:22,496 --> 01:44:23,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is this a problem?

1343
01:44:25,305 --> 01:44:28,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, that was our last slotted story for tonight.

1344
01:44:28,189 --> 01:44:30,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to go to the listener roundtable.

1345
01:44:30,092 --> 01:44:36,081
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to invite your calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord, but we also like to invite your emails every week.

1346
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:38,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

1347
01:44:38,424 --> 01:44:40,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I saw anything this week, though.

1348
01:44:40,407 --> 01:44:41,429
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me check with DarkSakura.

1349
01:44:44,094 --> 01:44:45,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Echofilter, insert here.

1350
01:44:45,955 --> 01:44:48,335
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.

1351
01:44:48,335 --> 01:44:49,656
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1352
01:44:49,656 --> 01:44:52,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So no emails this week, but we'll invite for the future weeks.

1353
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at OrangeLongstreet.com.

1354
01:44:54,557 --> 01:45:03,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anybody in our green room yet, but while we wait, also, if you want to just shout out a question in chat, I know some of you are here every week and you never go to the green room and that's fine.

1355
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:06,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And not everybody wants to talk and do all that thing.

1356
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to put questions in chat, we are all about answering those as well.

1357
01:45:10,821 --> 01:45:18,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, or, you know, and technically on a week like this, where we haven't even hit the two hour mark yet talking about games.

1358
01:45:18,163 --> 01:45:22,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we're willing to talk about non game stuff to within reason.

1359
01:45:22,124 --> 01:45:23,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it cute.

1360
01:45:23,124 --> 01:45:23,785
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1361
01:45:23,785 --> 01:45:29,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, this isn't one of those like, ask me anonymously things and all the questions end up being dirty.

1362
01:45:29,986 --> 01:45:33,867
[SPEAKER_06]: It isn't that all right.

1363
01:45:33,867 --> 01:45:34,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Mother's Day.

1364
01:45:34,847 --> 01:45:36,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ask a question you wouldn't ask your mother.

1365
01:45:37,308 --> 01:45:41,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I did spread something at work for the record.

1366
01:45:41,253 --> 01:45:46,340
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic words of Chi-Chi Devane.

1367
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get ready, I stay ready.

1368
01:45:47,882 --> 01:45:49,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get ready, I stay ready.

1369
01:45:49,765 --> 01:45:51,427
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're born ready, you don't have to get ready.

1370
01:45:51,427 --> 01:45:53,590
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1371
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:55,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

1372
01:45:55,871 --> 01:45:56,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

1373
01:45:56,932 --> 01:46:04,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some updates regarding the software called N64 Recomp.

1374
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It is this developer Wiseguy who put it together.

1375
01:46:09,324 --> 01:46:11,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may remember this person, Dave.

1376
01:46:13,087 --> 01:46:24,201
[SPEAKER_05]: actually done a lot of these recompiling reports, essentially decompiling Nintendo 64 games and recompiling them to run natively on PC.

1377
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:31,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And with this, one of the newest games to support that is actually Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask.

1378
01:46:33,091 --> 01:46:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And along with that, though, he has software now that will actually allow you to do this with any Nintendo 64 game to allow you to natively, well, some of the games, Banjo-Kazooie, Rocket Robot and even Superman 64.

1379
01:46:51,795 --> 01:46:58,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that would actually then further work through a game porting kit on a Mac.

1380
01:46:59,534 --> 01:47:03,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that thing is mirrored on webarchive.org or something before Nintendo shuts us down.

1381
01:47:23,012 --> 01:47:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that on.

1382
01:47:24,616 --> 01:47:27,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Sunday is a good day to put that out because the lawyers aren't working on Sunday.

1383
01:47:27,943 --> 01:47:29,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

1384
01:47:29,045 --> 01:47:33,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And Native, you know, Goldeneye or something like that would be interesting.

1385
01:47:34,501 --> 01:47:36,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we do have a call in the green room.

1386
01:47:36,222 --> 01:47:37,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bring in here in a minute.

1387
01:47:37,202 --> 01:47:44,705
[SPEAKER_06]: But SSJ100 Matt does want to point out before Tiger Claw says it again, because this was mentioned in our discord server earlier this week.

1388
01:47:44,705 --> 01:47:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting a John Wick pinball and a Funhaus remake pinball table.

1389
01:47:48,107 --> 01:48:01,572
[SPEAKER_06]: We did mention John Wick briefly at the top of the show when we were talking about DarkSakura going to the Golden State pinball and maybe I'm going to go to actually, but I don't think the Funhaus remake came up and I'm curious what you think about that like the remaking of the pinball.

1390
01:48:01,792 --> 01:48:07,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know it's not the first pinball table to ever be remade, but... Yeah, not your first choice of a pinball table to remake.

1391
01:48:08,425 --> 01:48:17,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I, I have slight chlorophobia and the, like that, just that head, like just drives me.

1392
01:48:17,106 --> 01:48:20,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, we had, we had a fun house and I can't stand it.

1393
01:48:20,647 --> 01:48:24,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm fine with like, no fear, you know, the skull head on there.

1394
01:48:24,668 --> 01:48:30,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And besides that, it's Steve Ritchie doing the voice and Steve's an awesome guy, but, um, but no fun house.

1395
01:48:30,749 --> 01:48:32,369
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't anything with the clown.

1396
01:48:32,369 --> 01:48:37,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I have trouble with, you know, what pinball table do you want to see him remake?

1397
01:48:39,147 --> 01:48:39,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Remade

1398
01:48:53,433 --> 01:49:06,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like Black Knight Sword of Rage or Black Knight 2000, but just a modern... Well, even just take Black Knight and then Black Knight 2000 and have, like, current tech-level versions of those.

1399
01:49:06,664 --> 01:49:20,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like what they did with Bride of Pinbot 2.0, where it has, like, the color DMD and everything, but have something that's more like an LCD screen or something.

1400
01:49:21,188 --> 01:49:25,413
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100 Matt in chat says, Jamie had a fun house, now she just has a house.

1401
01:49:25,413 --> 01:49:30,037
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but... My house is more fun than anybody else's house, okay?

1402
01:49:30,037 --> 01:49:33,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still pretty fun with all those pinball tables.

1403
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:33,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1404
01:49:33,861 --> 01:49:36,964
[SPEAKER_06]: PodCulture says, what would an OLR table be like?

1405
01:49:36,964 --> 01:49:39,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1406
01:49:39,246 --> 01:49:40,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Chaos and food and cats.

1407
01:49:40,788 --> 01:49:42,710
[SPEAKER_06]: It would break.

1408
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:43,771
[SPEAKER_06]: The balls would get stuck.

1409
01:49:46,845 --> 01:50:11,336
[SPEAKER_06]: uh we would have uh actually there would be there would be Loki's never-ending ramp where there would be a ramp that you would shoot the ball and it just stays in the ramp the rest of the game it's just the ball keeps going around and around and around and up and around and the ball just never comes out like the ball just stays in the ramp that would be it no it stays in the ramp until we get to FFS mode for fuck's sake and then we have a Loki multi ball

1410
01:50:13,716 --> 01:50:15,997
[SPEAKER_06]: PogCulture says would Bobby have the high score?

1411
01:50:15,997 --> 01:50:18,618
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but Mrs. Blackwolf would.

1412
01:50:18,618 --> 01:50:21,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf says it would be like the Ava table.

1413
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish.

1414
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:24,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't tease me with that.

1415
01:50:24,501 --> 01:50:25,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish.

1416
01:50:25,662 --> 01:50:26,242
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1417
01:50:26,242 --> 01:50:31,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it'd be like Jamie corner that's got like hodgepodge boyfriend plushies.

1418
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:35,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Right says every time it loops around it says rah rah rah rah rah rah rah.

1419
01:50:35,927 --> 01:50:38,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when the ball finally drops out it goes what?

1420
01:50:39,901 --> 01:50:41,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we do have a caller.

1421
01:50:41,402 --> 01:50:43,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget about the empty mailbag.

1422
01:50:43,963 --> 01:50:46,004
[SPEAKER_06]: A caller has been paid.

1423
01:50:46,004 --> 01:50:54,908
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you shoot the pinball in there, it goes, you know, yeah, you literally have an empty mailbag, but you lock the ball in there and it goes, Hello, LR, YYR here.

1424
01:50:54,908 --> 01:50:57,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that's right.

1425
01:50:57,949 --> 01:51:00,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Ferret only has one tee.

1426
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:03,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Red Retainment would also be in the mailbag.

1427
01:51:03,112 --> 01:51:04,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Mishkins.

1428
01:51:04,712 --> 01:51:07,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have your little sub game of bungee ferret tossing.

1429
01:51:09,242 --> 01:51:13,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But for our UK audience, it would have to be throwing.

1430
01:51:13,325 --> 01:51:21,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking Garth Wolf emails us once in a while, too, but not this weekend because FWA is this weekend, and I feel like that event's only getting bigger and bigger.

1431
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:28,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm seeing all these pictures and so many people I know they're going like FWA is not as big as Dragon Con yet, but damn, it's going to be a big convention out there.

1432
01:51:28,576 --> 01:51:30,397
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's furry week in Atlanta, for those that don't know.

1433
01:51:30,397 --> 01:51:32,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But that that is getting bigger and bigger.

1434
01:51:32,178 --> 01:51:36,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So pod culture just actually made me think of a fun drag queen furry name.

1435
01:51:36,682 --> 01:51:37,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1436
01:51:37,842 --> 01:51:38,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Ferret Fawcett.

1437
01:51:39,588 --> 01:51:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I have to bring up one thing real quick, Rob, while we get our caller in.

1438
01:51:46,273 --> 01:51:53,598
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the drag queens that you can like perform against in that stupid little game is called GG Easy.

1439
01:51:53,598 --> 01:51:55,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cute.

1440
01:51:55,879 --> 01:51:57,240
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cute name.

1441
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, G-I-G-I and then Easy.

1442
01:51:58,801 --> 01:51:59,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

1443
01:51:59,382 --> 01:52:00,202
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1444
01:52:00,202 --> 01:52:02,264
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a caller on the line who's been patiently waiting.

1445
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:03,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, LR, you're on the show.

1446
01:52:03,825 --> 01:52:04,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1447
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the one and only Neighborhood Ranma.

1448
01:52:07,519 --> 01:52:08,863
[SPEAKER_06]: How's everybody doing tonight?

1449
01:52:08,863 --> 01:52:09,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, fantastic.

1450
01:52:09,867 --> 01:52:10,468
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Ranma?

1451
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:13,829
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1452
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:38,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Caught off guard or anything like that.

1453
01:52:38,661 --> 01:52:39,362
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I gotcha.

1454
01:52:39,362 --> 01:52:39,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotcha.

1455
01:52:39,582 --> 01:52:39,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1456
01:52:39,822 --> 01:52:43,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be a tricky waiting game sometimes, but I appreciate you hanging in there.

1457
01:52:43,245 --> 01:52:44,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally get it.

1458
01:52:44,566 --> 01:52:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's on your mind tonight, my friend?

1459
01:52:46,967 --> 01:52:50,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go back to the comment that I made about- I'm sorry, quickly.

1460
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a visual thing.

1461
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, the podcast listeners.

1462
01:52:52,251 --> 01:52:55,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But Ranma's sitting there and he has his camera on, which is always lovely to see you.

1463
01:52:55,554 --> 01:53:00,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I noticed tonight you have a big curtain hanging up, like obscuring whatever.

1464
01:53:00,237 --> 01:53:03,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm always like, pay no attention.

1465
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:05,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

1466
01:53:06,761 --> 01:53:09,323
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever might be hiding back there.

1467
01:53:09,323 --> 01:53:25,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rob Roberts, I know I don't come on this show a lot, but I'm just wondering, you're just now noticing the curtain that divides my main room from the kitchen and where my my coffeemaker and my sexy air fryer is?

1468
01:53:25,678 --> 01:53:26,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I crazy?

1469
01:53:26,518 --> 01:53:28,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Has it been a different angle before?

1470
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God, I have not seen that curtain.

1471
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:43,562
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it might be a slightly different angle because my camera used to be more focused towards me, but I got like a fancy like light that sits on top of my monitor to help stuff like that.

1472
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:43,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1473
01:53:43,882 --> 01:53:44,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well now I understand.

1474
01:53:44,783 --> 01:53:46,024
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a kitchen back there.

1475
01:53:46,024 --> 01:53:46,464
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1476
01:53:46,464 --> 01:53:47,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I know where the coffee comes from.

1477
01:53:47,925 --> 01:53:49,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a jelly kitchen, you know.

1478
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.

1479
01:53:51,661 --> 01:53:52,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so chat is agreeing.

1480
01:53:52,741 --> 01:53:55,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a different angle and the closet was directly behind you.

1481
01:53:55,323 --> 01:53:57,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So you couldn't see the curtain as easily.

1482
01:53:57,205 --> 01:53:59,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's probably what it was.

1483
01:53:59,066 --> 01:53:59,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1484
01:53:59,286 --> 01:54:01,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So long story short, I'm not crazy.

1485
01:54:01,027 --> 01:54:03,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what is it you want to talk about tonight?

1486
01:54:03,509 --> 01:54:06,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the comment about I mentioned about Microsoft.

1487
01:54:06,391 --> 01:54:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to put it out there that I am a former Microsoft employee.

1488
01:54:11,214 --> 01:54:11,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1489
01:54:12,575 --> 01:54:24,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna say first things first, I was out earlier tonight, and I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf, and I'm listening to you guys, and one thing I really appreciate about both shows is that- And how hard did you throw your phone?

1490
01:54:24,172 --> 01:54:26,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I didn't.

1491
01:54:26,475 --> 01:54:28,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't throw my phone at all.

1492
01:54:28,058 --> 01:54:28,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Because

1493
01:54:29,249 --> 01:54:31,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby made a lot of sense.

1494
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:32,633
[SPEAKER_07]: You made a lot of sense.

1495
01:54:32,633 --> 01:54:37,318
[SPEAKER_07]: The issue is a lot of these other podcasts that are talking about what's going on with Microsoft.

1496
01:54:37,318 --> 01:54:39,560
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not telling the whole story.

1497
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:44,846
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just telling enough where they can beat Microsoft with a shovel and bury them.

1498
01:54:44,846 --> 01:54:46,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll tell you this right now.

1499
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:52,735
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what happens with the Xbox gaming division, Microsoft is going to be alright.

1500
01:54:52,735 --> 01:55:00,604
[SPEAKER_07]: What people forget is that about 75-80% of Microsoft profits come from the enterprise.

1501
01:55:00,604 --> 01:55:05,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where all the money is coming from and they funnel it into the gaming division.

1502
01:55:05,409 --> 01:55:07,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's basically the long and short.

1503
01:55:08,456 --> 01:55:31,902
[SPEAKER_07]: now and that would be and that would be windows and office especially in businesses the whole business loop and um media management services uh mdm for microsoft branded phones and products and as i was telling one person who is a such a sony fan boy and looks for any reason to bash microsoft i said look

1504
01:55:33,314 --> 01:55:38,098
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as there's a Game Pass, there will always be an Xbox console.

1505
01:55:38,098 --> 01:55:42,322
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as there is Microsoft Windows, there will always be a Surface.

1506
01:55:42,322 --> 01:55:46,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they need first party hardware to show off what the software can do.

1507
01:55:46,966 --> 01:55:51,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it would be kind of embarrassing to Microsoft if they had...

1508
01:55:52,492 --> 01:55:56,395
[SPEAKER_07]: a Macbook and a Playstation showing off Game Pass.

1509
01:55:56,395 --> 01:56:02,241
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to have their own hardware to show what the software can do and what it's capable of.

1510
01:56:02,241 --> 01:56:03,782
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what people need to understand.

1511
01:56:03,782 --> 01:56:04,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, secondly,

1512
01:56:06,047 --> 01:56:19,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at how the rank and file structure is reminds me of something that they told us in training is that when you work for the Microsoft retail stores, you don't work for a subsidiary of Microsoft.

1513
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:21,391
[SPEAKER_07]: You work directly for Microsoft.

1514
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:24,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Satella is your end boss.

1515
01:56:24,431 --> 01:56:28,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they brought that up because they mentioned Apple for a brief moment.

1516
01:56:28,992 --> 01:56:31,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not know if it's still the same thing.

1517
01:56:31,253 --> 01:56:32,093
[SPEAKER_07]: They had said that

1518
01:56:32,353 --> 01:56:38,278
[SPEAKER_07]: The Apple Store is focused as a subsidiary and basically Tim Cook is not your boss.

1519
01:56:38,278 --> 01:56:39,399
[SPEAKER_07]: That's incorrect.

1520
01:56:39,399 --> 01:56:39,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1521
01:56:39,959 --> 01:56:43,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's been about 10 years since I've worked there.

1522
01:56:43,482 --> 01:56:45,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what they told us in training.

1523
01:56:45,183 --> 01:56:52,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So now the reason why I bring that up, look at DC.

1524
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:55,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at how DC does their movies and so forth.

1525
01:56:55,612 --> 01:56:58,594
[SPEAKER_07]: DC gets things going pretty well.

1526
01:56:58,594 --> 01:57:01,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Warner Brothers comes in and says, no, no.

1527
01:57:02,495 --> 01:57:03,516
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1528
01:57:03,516 --> 01:57:04,737
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1529
01:57:04,737 --> 01:57:05,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Make the movie.

1530
01:57:05,657 --> 01:57:06,718
[SPEAKER_07]: They make the movie.

1531
01:57:06,718 --> 01:57:08,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Good possibility the movie's going to tank out.

1532
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's Wonder Woman.

1533
01:57:10,721 --> 01:57:12,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that too.

1534
01:57:12,082 --> 01:57:15,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, look at Marvel.

1535
01:57:15,145 --> 01:57:19,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And Disney's like, here's a couple million dollars, go handle your business.

1536
01:57:22,573 --> 01:57:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel is like a subsidiary.

1537
01:57:24,775 --> 01:57:28,418
[SPEAKER_07]: They work within themselves to get things done.

1538
01:57:28,418 --> 01:57:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And Disney's like, okay, let's roll with it.

1539
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:36,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas DC tries to do that, but Warner Brothers is like, nah, that's not going to work that way.

1540
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:39,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft gaming is kind of the same way.

1541
01:57:39,234 --> 01:57:51,901
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox gaming division kind of has their shit together for the most part, but then the higher-ups who don't, who have the MBAs like Bobby said, who don't know the gaming, like you said, say, no, this is not going to work.

1542
01:57:53,662 --> 01:58:06,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I am more than inclined to believe that a lot of the issues within Microsoft's gaming division is not the gaming division itself, it's the higher-ups who sit on the board who don't know what video gaming is.

1543
01:58:09,713 --> 01:58:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm pointing in agreement.

1544
01:58:11,174 --> 01:58:11,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1545
01:58:11,934 --> 01:58:12,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Go off.

1546
01:58:12,755 --> 01:58:13,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Go off, my brother.

1547
01:58:13,535 --> 01:58:15,677
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what it is.

1548
01:58:15,677 --> 01:58:23,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I'm not shocked or upset or worried about Microsoft, because that's exactly how it is.

1549
01:58:23,121 --> 01:58:25,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm shocked and upset, but in a different way.

1550
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:27,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1551
01:58:27,721 --> 01:58:28,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Now look at Sony.

1552
01:58:28,861 --> 01:58:35,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony has a gaming division, they have an animation division, movie division, all these other divisions.

1553
01:58:35,163 --> 01:58:36,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Voltron Force!

1554
01:58:36,543 --> 01:58:39,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Has to bring money together in order to make the profits.

1555
01:58:39,923 --> 01:58:44,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And God forbid, one of the appendages of Sony doesn't do what they can.

1556
01:58:44,684 --> 01:58:53,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you haven't noticed, they're trying to become, they're trying to go from the appendages of Voltron to the Infinity Gauntlet as they try to acquire Paramount.

1557
01:58:55,510 --> 01:59:10,428
[SPEAKER_06]: um, I want to I want to bring this comment up because Bobby said this in chat and he said this a few times on his show and on social media and it is it is accurate but it's also that where like perception fucks everything right so Bobby Blackwell in chat says great art takes risks

1558
01:59:10,868 --> 01:59:14,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Great MBAs running businesses minimize risks, right?

1559
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:21,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And that kind of ties into what I said earlier is that the reason why the perception and that is like what Bobby is saying is 100% true.

1560
01:59:21,573 --> 01:59:23,835
[SPEAKER_06]: But we all know perception is king, right?

1561
01:59:23,835 --> 01:59:29,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And most gamers out there with an active social media account do not give two fucks about the business side of it.

1562
01:59:29,517 --> 01:59:32,379
[SPEAKER_06]: But it all plays into that whole thing I said earlier, where

1563
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:43,784
[SPEAKER_06]: For years and years of years, we have been carrying this banner and fighting this fight and trying to legitimize video games under this banner and this rallying cry of video games are art.

1564
01:59:43,784 --> 01:59:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: But this week has been a swift kick in the cooch of nope, video games are a business.

1565
01:59:51,828 --> 01:59:55,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why this whole thing sucks.

1566
01:59:55,050 --> 01:59:55,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right.

1567
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:57,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, let's go back a little bit.

1568
01:59:57,551 --> 01:59:59,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, let's say Microsoft

1569
02:00:00,573 --> 02:00:04,395
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically shut down the studios.

1570
02:00:04,395 --> 02:00:12,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, all the other gaming podcasts or whatever, they can read why Tango Gameworks did what happened.

1571
02:00:12,799 --> 02:00:18,122
[SPEAKER_07]: But somehow, they'll see that it's Microsoft's fault that it all happened.

1572
02:00:18,122 --> 02:00:20,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Ergo, it's Microsoft's fault that the studios are closed.

1573
02:00:20,643 --> 02:00:25,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though there have been these issues going on before, Microsoft's like, hey, what's going on down there, you know?

1574
02:00:28,103 --> 02:00:33,307
[SPEAKER_07]: because Microsoft is the father, and they dropped the money, and they're supposed to be responsible, you know?

1575
02:00:33,307 --> 02:00:38,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things don't always happen that way.

1576
02:00:38,632 --> 02:00:41,734
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another comment, because this has led to a whole thing in our chat.

1577
02:00:41,734 --> 02:00:50,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You were doing your DC versus Marvel thing earlier, Ranma, and PodCulture said, DC has great animated stuff, Marvel not as much.

1578
02:00:50,862 --> 02:00:53,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, whilst everyone is entitled to their own opinion,

1579
02:00:55,066 --> 02:01:03,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna say that is a very hard statement to swallow when X-Men 97 is all the rage right now.

1580
02:01:03,812 --> 02:01:06,434
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very hard statement to swallow.

1581
02:01:06,434 --> 02:01:10,117
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite German blueberry muffin is now on the team.

1582
02:01:10,117 --> 02:01:11,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy.

1583
02:01:11,478 --> 02:01:14,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me say this about X-Men 97 real quick and we'll get back to the matter at hand here.

1584
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:14,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

1585
02:01:15,561 --> 02:01:26,414
[SPEAKER_07]: In my 20 plus years of watching cartoons and anime and all of that, only 5 times I have watched a series where I felt myself crying like a damn baby.

1586
02:01:26,414 --> 02:01:27,435
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Men 97 hit that list!

1587
02:01:34,275 --> 02:01:41,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not bring that up to dunk on what Brad said, because again, everybody's entitled to their opinion, and maybe that particular series is out of sight right now.

1588
02:01:41,858 --> 02:01:48,420
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reason why I did bring it up, again, the business end of things sometimes suck versus the art.

1589
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:56,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't I correct in that the creator and writer and main driver behind that series is already not with Marvel anymore?

1590
02:01:56,063 --> 02:01:56,663
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

1591
02:01:56,663 --> 02:02:01,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're trying to, now fans are demanding that he come, are demanding that Marvel brings him back, you know.

1592
02:02:03,075 --> 02:02:07,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And the show's already got license, already been greenlit for a season two.

1593
02:02:07,037 --> 02:02:09,859
[SPEAKER_06]: But will it land the same without, again, it's hard to say.

1594
02:02:09,859 --> 02:02:14,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we don't know until we see it, but is it going to land the same without the same creative force at the helm?

1595
02:02:14,602 --> 02:02:18,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but we're all superman in Spider-Man 98.

1596
02:02:18,004 --> 02:02:21,946
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to, like, drag Claremont out of retirement.

1597
02:02:21,946 --> 02:02:28,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when he goes, they're going to hook his brain up to a machine and have the Claremont AI with so many plot twists that we won't know what to do.

1598
02:02:29,281 --> 02:02:31,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give them ideas.

1599
02:02:31,383 --> 02:02:35,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And then part of that AI is going to incorporate Rob Liefeld's lack of feet.

1600
02:02:35,426 --> 02:02:40,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone will be ballerinas walking around with 70 different storylines that all somehow have to do with Phoenix.

1601
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:43,431
[SPEAKER_03]: What in the hell?

1602
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:46,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a choose your own adventure book.

1603
02:02:46,273 --> 02:02:49,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like early 80s X-Men.

1604
02:02:49,736 --> 02:02:50,336
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1605
02:02:50,336 --> 02:02:53,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've gone from Microsoft to X-Men, which is fine.

1606
02:02:53,118 --> 02:02:56,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But, Ranma, any other thoughts you wanted to get out before we let you go tonight?

1607
02:02:56,914 --> 02:02:58,335
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1608
02:02:58,335 --> 02:02:59,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to get that out.

1609
02:02:59,735 --> 02:03:07,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I appreciate that both of these shows brought in the insight to everything, because there is a saying.

1610
02:03:07,759 --> 02:03:09,640
[SPEAKER_07]: They say there's two sides to every story.

1611
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:11,881
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there are four sides to every story.

1612
02:03:11,881 --> 02:03:17,044
[SPEAKER_07]: What he said, what she said, what people perceived when it happened, and then there's a truth.

1613
02:03:17,044 --> 02:03:25,468
[SPEAKER_07]: But by the time we get to the truth, which is where we see what's all going on, nobody gives a damn at that point, because people already believe what they perceived is what really had happened.

1614
02:03:26,636 --> 02:03:28,898
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's that's absolutely it.

1615
02:03:28,898 --> 02:03:33,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we try and I'm I'm not being shady with this comment because I want to support all podcasts.

1616
02:03:33,961 --> 02:03:42,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to support most YouTubers, although I got to say there's some sort of culture over there sometimes that it really leans into the sensationalism and I do not like it.

1617
02:03:42,788 --> 02:03:54,396
[SPEAKER_06]: But and I hate to say this on Bobby Blackwolf's birthday, but sometimes we try to be the adults in the room when it's appropriate.

1618
02:03:54,396 --> 02:03:54,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Well,

1619
02:03:55,390 --> 02:04:02,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that means we're going to need to get an adultier adult at this point.

1620
02:04:02,034 --> 02:04:05,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we try to be the grandparents in the room.

1621
02:04:05,496 --> 02:04:08,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1622
02:04:08,638 --> 02:04:11,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I have convention children.

1623
02:04:11,719 --> 02:04:12,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't.

1624
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:14,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't.

1625
02:04:14,061 --> 02:04:15,802
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1626
02:04:15,802 --> 02:04:17,403
[SPEAKER_06]: What convention is up next?

1627
02:04:17,403 --> 02:04:18,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead, Jamie.

1628
02:04:18,904 --> 02:04:22,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to leave just mention one thing that's on my adulting calendar.

1629
02:04:23,937 --> 02:04:30,680
[SPEAKER_03]: The month of May is adulting is automatically spending $50 every time you leave the house.

1630
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:33,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1631
02:04:33,202 --> 02:04:38,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, what conventions up next for you for our talks on anime jam session Tuesday nights?

1632
02:04:38,964 --> 02:04:41,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next convention is shenanigan.

1633
02:04:41,826 --> 02:04:43,126
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in June.

1634
02:04:43,126 --> 02:04:45,748
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a 21 plus two day convention.

1635
02:04:46,688 --> 02:04:48,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Not enough of those in this country.

1636
02:04:48,650 --> 02:04:51,292
[SPEAKER_06]: A 21 plus two day convention.

1637
02:04:51,292 --> 02:04:51,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1638
02:04:51,873 --> 02:04:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a disaster.

1639
02:04:54,435 --> 02:04:56,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wear a Hot Mess Express.

1640
02:04:56,157 --> 02:04:56,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a disaster.

1641
02:04:56,737 --> 02:04:57,898
[SPEAKER_06]: A Hot Mess Express.

1642
02:04:57,898 --> 02:04:59,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do I sign up?

1643
02:04:59,319 --> 02:05:01,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are two very different things.

1644
02:05:01,481 --> 02:05:05,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you should know about the people that are running Shenanigan.

1645
02:05:05,025 --> 02:05:05,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1646
02:05:05,985 --> 02:05:06,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1647
02:05:06,346 --> 02:05:07,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the people that run DerpyCon.

1648
02:05:08,832 --> 02:05:10,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

1649
02:05:10,052 --> 02:05:11,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, really.

1650
02:05:11,313 --> 02:05:12,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Is DerpyCon still?

1651
02:05:12,493 --> 02:05:23,636
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I need to reach out to some of those people because I hadn't heard anything about the guidebook this year, which, y'all know, I have been the DerpyCon guidebook person for like almost a decade now.

1652
02:05:23,636 --> 02:05:29,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm supposed to go fly out to the con and then COVID.

1653
02:05:29,078 --> 02:05:30,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is Shenanigan?

1654
02:05:30,898 --> 02:05:33,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Shenanigan is in Parsippany, New Jersey.

1655
02:05:38,342 --> 02:05:40,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I know Rob.

1656
02:05:40,105 --> 02:05:41,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1657
02:05:41,086 --> 02:05:44,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody goes to Jersey willingly.

1658
02:05:44,151 --> 02:05:44,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1659
02:05:44,973 --> 02:05:46,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand this.

1660
02:05:46,395 --> 02:05:46,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Farmer?

1661
02:05:48,317 --> 02:05:48,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Cows?

1662
02:06:12,267 --> 02:06:17,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, literally, I know there's no such thing as stupid questions.

1663
02:06:17,668 --> 02:06:19,688
[SPEAKER_06]: However... Yeah, there are.

1664
02:06:19,688 --> 02:06:20,188
[SPEAKER_03]: There are.

1665
02:06:20,188 --> 02:06:28,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them would actually be, what kind of shenanigans happen in Parsippany, New Jersey?

1666
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:30,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The kind of shenanigans that lead out of Parsippany.

1667
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:32,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a dumb fucking question.

1668
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:35,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I'm just gonna say this.

1669
02:06:35,171 --> 02:06:40,652
[SPEAKER_07]: When you say there's no such thing as a stupid question, I want you to do my job for two hours.

1670
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:43,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Just two hours!

1671
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:51,732
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think Rob's job probably involves a good number of... I didn't pay attention, so I'm gonna ask a stupid question.

1672
02:06:51,732 --> 02:06:59,693
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually had someone call into the help desk asking how to restart their machine.

1673
02:06:59,693 --> 02:07:00,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1674
02:07:00,693 --> 02:07:02,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's saying something else in chat.

1675
02:07:02,914 --> 02:07:04,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this true?

1676
02:07:04,054 --> 02:07:09,175
[SPEAKER_06]: The big guest is an anime therapist.

1677
02:07:09,175 --> 02:07:09,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

1678
02:07:11,161 --> 02:07:14,626
[SPEAKER_07]: He- Carl is not an anime therapist per se.

1679
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually has his MSW in social work.

1680
02:07:18,472 --> 02:07:25,582
[SPEAKER_07]: He does actual social work, but he's been part of the con scene and anime scene for so long, he knows how to do an even blend of both.

1681
02:07:27,847 --> 02:07:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what exactly is that?

1682
02:07:30,411 --> 02:07:34,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of the guys that do cinema therapy.

1683
02:07:34,576 --> 02:07:40,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise to God I'm not trying to be shady, but I just noticed on the Shenanigan page, he is the only guest coming.

1684
02:07:40,705 --> 02:07:44,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, please look forward to this at the Embassy Suites in Parsippany, New Jersey.

1685
02:07:45,635 --> 02:07:50,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, like I said, Carl does have his actual MSW in social work.

1686
02:07:50,616 --> 02:07:53,157
[SPEAKER_07]: He does an equal blend of both, okay?

1687
02:07:53,157 --> 02:08:01,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the last time someone tried to pull this off, they did not have their degree, and they've currently been banned by the APA to practice anything at all.

1688
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:04,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, their degree in psychology is useless.

1689
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:06,360
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's actually 4D chess.

1690
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It is all 4D chess.

1691
02:08:07,641 --> 02:08:10,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's the only guest we need to bring to the shenanigan con?

1692
02:08:10,822 --> 02:08:11,582
[SPEAKER_06]: A therapist.

1693
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:15,342
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 40 fuckin' chats and I applaud it.

1694
02:08:15,342 --> 02:08:18,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say, Uncle Yo is an amazing person.

1695
02:08:18,405 --> 02:08:21,907
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go on YouTube and look up his- I think I've heard of him before.

1696
02:08:21,907 --> 02:08:26,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, if you look up his- Well, and make it Aurelio Voltaire at DerpyCon.

1697
02:08:26,711 --> 02:08:28,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Voltaire's fuckin' rad.

1698
02:08:28,112 --> 02:08:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I like him.

1699
02:08:28,593 --> 02:08:30,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1700
02:08:30,474 --> 02:08:37,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally- I got to host a thing that he did here in Sacramento, and I kinda said, Hey, I'm Rob Roberts, it's nice to meet you.

1701
02:08:37,079 --> 02:08:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really weird to see you outside of DragonCon.

1702
02:08:42,937 --> 02:08:45,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how he took that, but whatever.

1703
02:08:45,759 --> 02:08:57,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I expect Shanannica to have a few more guests, because this is sort of like an experiment per se, because registration opens tomorrow and is capped at 450 people, just to see how it goes.

1704
02:08:57,665 --> 02:08:58,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1705
02:08:58,165 --> 02:09:01,046
[SPEAKER_03]: They can have me as a guest.

1706
02:09:01,046 --> 02:09:04,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Or basically, I'll just sit around and talk about my cat in Dead by Daylight.

1707
02:09:04,788 --> 02:09:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come and do a Predicting the Future panel.

1708
02:09:08,971 --> 02:09:11,652
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Matt there to be like, why this sucks panel.

1709
02:09:14,681 --> 02:09:15,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, all right, Rama.

1710
02:09:15,702 --> 02:09:16,582
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a delight.

1711
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:19,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't wait for the video footage out of Parsippany, New Jersey.

1712
02:09:19,803 --> 02:09:21,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we will be going.

1713
02:09:21,644 --> 02:09:23,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And before I get out of here, Rob.

1714
02:09:23,865 --> 02:09:24,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1715
02:09:24,445 --> 02:09:28,387
[SPEAKER_07]: You are going to Galloping Ghosts, right?

1716
02:09:28,387 --> 02:09:29,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1717
02:09:29,027 --> 02:09:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the fuck is that?

1718
02:09:30,808 --> 02:09:32,988
[SPEAKER_06]: What's Galloping Ghosts?

1719
02:09:32,988 --> 02:09:36,710
[SPEAKER_07]: In Chicago, Galloping Ghosts Arcade.

1720
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:37,710
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know the details.

1721
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:38,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, is this

1722
02:09:39,725 --> 02:09:40,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Arcade

1723
02:09:58,310 --> 02:10:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had a lot of things there, Galloping Ghosts, but like, didn't they have like the Primal Rage 2 machine?

1724
02:10:04,434 --> 02:10:04,594
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1725
02:10:04,594 --> 02:10:05,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that you guys are talking about this.

1726
02:10:05,794 --> 02:10:08,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they have a Primal Rage 2 machine that I saw it.

1727
02:10:08,216 --> 02:10:08,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1728
02:10:08,916 --> 02:10:10,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And I sent Jamie.

1729
02:10:10,717 --> 02:10:11,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It just clicked for me.

1730
02:10:11,718 --> 02:10:13,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen like the YouTube of this.

1731
02:10:13,118 --> 02:10:14,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize that was in Chicago.

1732
02:10:14,879 --> 02:10:16,981
[SPEAKER_07]: It's outside of Chicago.

1733
02:10:16,981 --> 02:10:20,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes about 20 minutes to get there by car.

1734
02:10:20,122 --> 02:10:20,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Which might be hard.

1735
02:10:20,823 --> 02:10:21,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

1736
02:10:21,363 --> 02:10:21,763
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1737
02:10:21,763 --> 02:10:21,983
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1738
02:10:21,983 --> 02:10:26,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm just saying, it's Ingress weekend and it's IML weekend.

1739
02:10:26,446 --> 02:10:26,706
[SPEAKER_06]: But I

1740
02:10:27,438 --> 02:10:29,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we'll see.

1741
02:10:29,859 --> 02:10:31,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It's huge.

1742
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:37,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I went in, I lost my partner and I lost my friend trying to find him so we can go out and eat.

1743
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:41,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And we ended up over at a building down the way where there's nothing but strictly pinball.

1744
02:10:41,981 --> 02:10:42,961
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'll check it out.

1745
02:10:42,961 --> 02:10:43,421
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1746
02:10:43,421 --> 02:10:43,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1747
02:10:43,761 --> 02:10:48,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I am there for a few days, so never say never.

1748
02:10:48,402 --> 02:10:48,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1749
02:10:48,822 --> 02:10:56,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just saying, if it's the Leather Daddy convention or the arcade, I'm probably going to go to the one that's only one one weekend a year.

1750
02:10:57,395 --> 02:11:01,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Rob, if it was me, I'd probably feel the same way, too.

1751
02:11:01,557 --> 02:11:02,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1752
02:11:02,697 --> 02:11:04,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1753
02:11:04,298 --> 02:11:09,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I mean, when I was there, I did get I did take I did see the Puli Lura machine.

1754
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:11,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent Jamie a picture of it.

1755
02:11:11,761 --> 02:11:12,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.

1756
02:11:12,821 --> 02:11:13,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.

1757
02:11:13,321 --> 02:11:15,482
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Rob, I am letting you go.

1758
02:11:15,482 --> 02:11:17,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1759
02:11:17,883 --> 02:11:18,043
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1760
02:11:19,005 --> 02:11:19,965
[SPEAKER_06]: That was saying cool.

1761
02:11:19,965 --> 02:11:20,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1762
02:11:20,185 --> 02:11:20,485
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1763
02:11:20,485 --> 02:11:21,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1764
02:11:21,586 --> 02:11:22,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1765
02:11:22,626 --> 02:11:23,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, as always.

1766
02:11:23,286 --> 02:11:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1767
02:11:23,706 --> 02:11:25,187
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1768
02:11:25,187 --> 02:11:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a delight to hear from DJ Rama S here on this program.

1769
02:11:28,268 --> 02:11:33,950
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think with that, we are going to let me check in one more time, see if Loki has any other last minute stories to talk about.

1770
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:35,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

1771
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:36,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

1772
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:38,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a fun one.

1773
02:11:38,031 --> 02:11:40,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there was a

1774
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:50,800
[SPEAKER_05]: a streamer that had commissioned this modder Snipsu to recreate Akuma Mode in Resident Evil 2.

1775
02:11:50,800 --> 02:12:00,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Akuma Mode was something that was part of, and this is like a way back thing, a lot of kids may not remember this, EGM used to have like their game,

1776
02:12:02,583 --> 02:12:20,380
[SPEAKER_05]: April Fools edition where they would have fake stories in there and one of the screenshots was you know Akuma mode in Resident Evil 2 you have to do all this like crazy stuff to be able to play as Akuma in the game well now you can and it's on ModDB if you're you want to check it out that's awesome

1777
02:12:21,348 --> 02:12:23,630
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, that is beautiful.

1778
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:33,257
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt piggybacking off the phone call we just had saying, Rob, if you want to know what the top 15 things to do in Parsippany, New Jersey is, there is a list.

1779
02:12:33,257 --> 02:12:38,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And we actually have a list here from TripAdvisor has put together a list of the top things to do in Parsippany.

1780
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:45,685
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them have pictures, but they range from the top couple are a park to number four is the target.

1781
02:12:45,685 --> 02:12:49,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four is going to Target and number six is going to Marshalls.

1782
02:12:52,610 --> 02:12:56,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Mobile has more to do than that.

1783
02:12:56,231 --> 02:12:58,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you want to go to Marshall's over the spa?

1784
02:12:58,852 --> 02:12:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's the thing.

1785
02:12:59,793 --> 02:13:03,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Good fucking deals, Loki.

1786
02:13:03,755 --> 02:13:06,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you go to you go to Marshall's to buy skincare and transformers.

1787
02:13:08,871 --> 02:13:15,142
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I like, drove, or like, flew all the way to, you know, that city just for your marshals?

1788
02:13:15,142 --> 02:13:20,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that your target and marshals are among the to-do things in this town!

1789
02:13:22,830 --> 02:13:26,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I sound like Paul Lint just now?

1790
02:13:26,913 --> 02:13:33,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time I go out to that part of the country, which has been a long time because I'm not at that job anymore that used to send me to Allentown.

1791
02:13:33,437 --> 02:13:46,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I'm ever out in that part of the country ever again, I'm going to make it my goal to go to Parsippany, New Jersey, just to make that social media post that says, Hi, I'm in Parsippany.

1792
02:13:46,885 --> 02:13:49,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in Waynesworld, we're in Delaware.

1793
02:13:49,767 --> 02:13:50,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Delaware.

1794
02:13:54,133 --> 02:13:56,734
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, on that note, we are ending the show.

1795
02:13:56,734 --> 02:13:58,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait for the angry email.

1796
02:13:58,194 --> 02:14:01,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a listener of yours and Parsippany, and I find it very rude.

1797
02:14:01,194 --> 02:14:02,435
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1798
02:14:02,435 --> 02:14:05,915
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's more like we're going to get when they be like, you're correct.

1799
02:14:05,915 --> 02:14:06,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Help.

1800
02:14:06,815 --> 02:14:08,476
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in Sacramento, California.

1801
02:14:08,476 --> 02:14:11,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been the butt of those kind of jokes for years and years and years.

1802
02:14:11,256 --> 02:14:14,957
[SPEAKER_06]: The tagline of Sacramento is, hey, at least we're not Fresno.

1803
02:14:14,957 --> 02:14:15,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on.

1804
02:14:15,397 --> 02:14:18,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Just try being from Alabama.

1805
02:14:18,758 --> 02:14:20,278
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, well, we ain't Mississippi.

1806
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:22,780
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're wrapping up.

1807
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:23,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying.

1808
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:24,660
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1809
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:26,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1810
02:14:26,541 --> 02:14:29,322
[SPEAKER_06]: If you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, tell a friend or two about the show.

1811
02:14:29,322 --> 02:14:34,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1812
02:14:34,864 --> 02:14:39,866
[SPEAKER_06]: A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it was that you found this podcast.

1813
02:14:39,866 --> 02:14:42,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Those all go an awful long way.

1814
02:14:42,828 --> 02:14:46,569
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be back in seven days to do this all over again.

1815
02:14:46,569 --> 02:14:49,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, DarkSakura, let's go to you with your final thought.

1816
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:51,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're going to be streaming tonight.

1817
02:14:52,054 --> 02:15:02,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I took your advice about my thing, and I am now sending you stickers that I have made of my avatar making weird faces.

1818
02:15:02,537 --> 02:15:03,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1819
02:15:03,077 --> 02:15:05,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that, and I reacted.

1820
02:15:05,698 --> 02:15:06,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you three more.

1821
02:15:06,758 --> 02:15:07,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1822
02:15:07,118 --> 02:15:08,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll look when I get a break.

1823
02:15:08,379 --> 02:15:08,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1824
02:15:09,423 --> 02:15:09,843
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1825
02:15:09,843 --> 02:15:10,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And Waffle House.

1826
02:15:10,904 --> 02:15:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we forget?

1827
02:15:11,525 --> 02:15:12,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, everyone.

1828
02:15:12,265 --> 02:15:12,946
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1829
02:15:12,946 --> 02:15:23,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who can get to a Waffle House and buy me two bags of grits from behind the counter, because the only way I can get those fuckers online is to order this big kit of shit.

1830
02:15:23,795 --> 02:15:27,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get one bag of grits.

1831
02:15:27,218 --> 02:15:28,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, remind me.

1832
02:15:28,399 --> 02:15:31,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me next time I go to Atlanta.

1833
02:15:31,621 --> 02:15:32,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I. All right.

1834
02:15:32,862 --> 02:15:34,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night.

1835
02:15:34,444 --> 02:15:34,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1836
02:15:34,724 --> 02:15:36,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1837
02:15:36,005 --> 02:15:38,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that takes us to Loki and your final thought tonight.

1838
02:15:39,327 --> 02:15:41,250
[SPEAKER_05]: LittleKittyBigCity no sprint button, button for zoomies

1839
02:15:50,949 --> 02:16:04,238
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thoughts, speaking of little kitties, I don't mean to end on a downer, but I do want to let everybody know that Mr. Smush had a vet appointment and we found out that he has kidney disease, which is not a pleasant thing for a kitty to be going through.

1840
02:16:04,238 --> 02:16:17,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still at a stage where we're hoping with some treatment through special food and potentially we're going to get evaluated this week to see if he could do IV liquid types of things to help, you know, sustain a quality of life or what have you.

1841
02:16:17,487 --> 02:16:19,749
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do that for Mr. Smush, but

1842
02:16:20,549 --> 02:16:22,390
[SPEAKER_06]: He still has a lot of his personality.

1843
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:23,051
[SPEAKER_06]: He's hanging in there.

1844
02:16:23,051 --> 02:16:24,552
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just been drinking a lot of water.

1845
02:16:24,552 --> 02:16:28,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, there were signs in there that made us want to go to the vet and all of that.

1846
02:16:28,374 --> 02:16:36,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that he has been an icon of sorts for this show ever since we were together doing it at the house really ever since we got him in 2017.

1847
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:43,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's, you know, Alan and I are just kind of processing that and it sucks, but we're doing what we can.

1848
02:16:44,765 --> 02:16:50,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I just want to let all of you know, um, cause you've shown him a lot of love over the years and he's a very famous cat because of all of you.

1849
02:16:50,809 --> 02:16:53,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll keep posting the pictures where I can.

1850
02:16:53,590 --> 02:17:00,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, just, uh, put some positive vibes out there in the universe and lots of virtual kitty treats, uh, for Mr. Smush.

1851
02:17:00,534 --> 02:17:01,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he'd appreciate it.

1852
02:17:01,935 --> 02:17:07,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So otherwise to try to end on a happier note, um, I look forward to seeing everybody again next week.

1853
02:17:07,779 --> 02:17:12,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really look forward to vacation in two weeks cause there's nothing better in the world than vacation.

1854
02:17:13,516 --> 02:17:14,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good week, everybody.

1855
02:17:14,456 --> 02:17:15,197
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.

1856
02:17:15,197 --> 02:17:16,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy gaming.

1857
02:17:16,257 --> 02:17:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.
