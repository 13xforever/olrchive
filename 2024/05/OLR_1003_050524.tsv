9750	17456	As a data maintainer myself, I extend immense empathy to OpenStreetMap's maintainers over their database being ravaged by individuals for the sake of becoming Pokemon masters.
17456	25403	A database that seeks to map and describe the real world is having its data manipulated in order for users to pad their Pokedex without having to leave their homes or other places of frequent existence.
25403	28125	Ash's journey would have been a lot easier if he rewrote the world around him.
28125	29906	This is the end's Justify the Means headline.
29906	34770	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34770	36952	Starting right now on the show, wherever a gamer has a voice,
39793	48161	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48161	50843	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50843	54987	We're live once again with episode number 1003 for tonight, May the 5th of 2024.
54987	57830	Happy Cinco de Mayo to those that are
62614	63514	Revenge of the Fifth
85111	92917	I know the different places will do different ones, but I'll be perfectly honest, I'd rather leave my memory.
92917	106808	I do have DVDs of the theatrical releases of the original trilogy, and I have the THX remasters without having the extra shit added on Laserdisc.
109812	119760	OrangeRite in our chat, because we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.
119760	123703	And OrangeRite in our chat says, eh, it's probably better than episode two.
123703	127406	Episode two did have that pretty bitchin' Yoda lightsaber fight, though.
127406	129448	That was like the whole reason to see episode two.
129448	131289	Otherwise, yeah, you're probably right.
131289	136553	That was the most weird CG.
136553	138275	Yeah, probably it's not aged well at all.
139628	143769	Well, it wasn't even aged well when it was new.
143769	149231	It was like, this looks like I'm watching a Muppet on a green screen.
149231	150651	Which guess what?
150651	153172	It was a digital Muppet on a green screen.
153172	154372	Digital Muppets.
154372	156153	That's gonna be the name of my band.
156153	160954	Bobby Blackwolf in chat pointing out episode one was 25 years ago.
160954	162175	It's a nice round number.
162175	163535	Oh, that thought didn't occur to me.
163535	166976	But now that you bring that up, I'm, I'm a little upset.
168858	171039	I was in college when episode one came out.
171039	175483	I remember I was in Chico State and we went to the big theater downtown, the El Rey.
175483	177605	I don't even know if it's still there.
177605	179466	For all I know, they've bulldozed it at this point.
179466	185111	And we were in the very, very, very last row, way at the fucking top of the theater.
185111	189254	This is one of those like old school auditoriums with like 500 seats.
189254	191376	It was like a single screen theater type of thing.
191376	192296	We were all the way in the back.
192296	193798	I think we were at a midnight showing.
194338	195699	The One and Only Techmaster Loki!
215456	217257	Is he taking care of people?
217257	220157	I don't know.
220157	226939	I think the best meme I saw in the Star Trek community, because, you know, people always want to start a fight between Star Trek and Star Wars.
226939	228560	I'm not interested in starting a fight.
228560	235321	I thought the nicest meme I saw was the the the Klingon meme that said glory to the other franchise today.
235321	236642	I thought that was nice.
236642	237222	Nice.
237222	238102	Nice sentiment.
238102	239363	So.
239363	240083	Oh, there was a
243061	251303	Tim Russ did a video as a Vulcan take on Star Wars.
251303	252423	I didn't see that.
252423	254264	He was Tuvok for those who don't know.
254264	254864	Yep.
254864	261645	And he's also the We Ain't Found Shit guy in Spaceballs, which in some ways was almost a more notable role.
261645	262465	No, no, I love Tuvok.
262465	263085	I love Voyager.
263085	264746	I'm just messing around, but yeah.
265826	266707	R2-D2, Star Trek
285650	297197	Uh, anyway, Tigerclaw in our chat is asking, so Loki, you've got a sort of Sonic game playing in the background, because if you are watching live, you do get to see us, you know, taping over Discord and you see our video and all that good stuff.
297197	305381	So, um, I, we can see like your background, which to hide your kitchen, Loki, you do like a little video game in the background, uh, that plays.
305381	306742	It's my digital green screen.
306742	307463	Your digital green screen.
307463	309644	So what, what is this game that we're looking at tonight?
309960	310521	DrRobotnik's Ring Racers
330799	331779	I have to check that out.
331779	332960	That sounds like a lot of fun.
332960	334880	So let's see.
334880	343363	Bobby Blackwolf is talking about the R2D2 shirt that says, I wear that shirt all the time when I'm out and about, but not at Dragon Con, because everyone has them.
343363	344163	Fact.
344163	345984	Everyone has that shirt at Dragon Con.
345984	348925	I'm definitely wearing that shirt whenever I go to Galaxy's Edge.
348925	350185	Yes.
350185	350706	Perfect.
354286	369624	rest in peace to the Star Trek experience at what used to be the Hilton I don't even think it's the Hilton anymore in Vegas I think it's called something else in Vegas that's I miss that experience and I would have worn the shirt there if it was still a thing so all right
370387	372828	Anyway, we're going to get into our show tonight.
372828	376148	Episode number 1003, if you can believe it.
376148	378269	There's some stuff going on in gaming.
378269	380829	A lot of people talking about this first topic tonight.
380829	385770	Let's jump right into the topic that's got a lot of people, especially depending on where you live.
385770	388251	A lot of people pretty heated this week.
388251	389871	Loki, what's going on?
389871	390111	Yeah.
390111	397893	So essentially, Sony has now their wording removed the grace period with
401196	404818	You had to have a PSN account linked to your
406428	408969	player in Helldivers.
408969	414550	During launch, they had it where you can link either your Steam account or your PlayStation Network account.
414550	418071	But now it has to be a PlayStation Network account.
418071	421472	The problem is with that is one, people don't want to do that.
421472	425274	Maybe they don't necessarily have a PlayStation Network account.
425274	432756	And two, not every single region in the world has PlayStation Network access.
433576	438059	So you could have, say, purchased that in a part of the world that doesn't have that.
438059	441081	And now you're out of luck.
441081	442582	Enjoy your paperweight.
442582	447265	So, of course, folks have been very upset about that.
447265	449126	It's not even a paperweight.
449126	450787	It's an e-paperweight.
450787	452328	E-paperweight.
452328	454169	Well, it's holding down your e-paper.
454169	454469	Okay.
455902	457143	your ebank statement.
472099	477363	you know, games are coming out for $70 and they're coming out unfinished and all this stuff.
477363	484009	Well, now it's overwhelmingly negative on Steam for one.
484009	487292	And then who could have ever guessed that would happen?
487292	489374	Who could have ever guessed that that would happen?
489374	495218	Yeah, it's just, you know, there's a lot of people that are just against it now.
495218	497460	They're review bombing it.
497460	500323	They are uninstalling it.
501474	503216	It's just, it's, it's ridiculous.
503216	505719	And what did Sony think was going to happen?
505719	505959	Really?
505959	507461	What did they think was going to happen?
507461	512566	Uh, that they would be able to, I could announce, enjoy the Sony network as well.
512566	514128	I'm going to buy more games.
514128	523438	No, uh, they, they were expecting that they would be able to announce at their next shareholder meeting that, wow, we suddenly had a spike in people creating PlayStation accounts, you know,
523838	533543	People are saying that sales of the PlayStation 5 are slowing, but look, wow, our presence increasing on PC is driving engagement on PlayStation Network.
533543	537745	Look at all these new accounts and all these new people getting the app and blah, blah, blah.
537745	540387	And is that happening?
540387	541908	Well, we'll find out.
541908	544789	I imagine it will happen to some scale, actually.
544789	547751	Yeah, there's going to be a lot of people
548919	561527	probably the US, Canada, Europe, the places where, you know, Sony does exist that don't follow gaming news as closely that are just gonna, oh, I have to play, do this to make it with my friend, whatever.
561527	564629	This takes me five seconds to create an email, whatever, sign.
564629	567050	I'm not reading the terms of agreement done.
567050	575955	So in a way, I mean, we won't know until the earnings call, but yeah, I think it will work to an extent, but will it be worth the backlash?
575955	578417	That's the real question we're going to find out, I guess.
579147	585148	Yeah, but no one's gonna trust them in the future if they ever do anything, you know, along the same lines started off the same way.
585148	590189	Yeah, it's a big kick in their brand balls.
590189	598671	Especially if you live in one of the countries, most of them seem to be in Africa, where Steam exists, but PlayStation does not.
598671	606033	Yeah, of course, you're gonna question buying any Sony product in the future, even the first party games that don't require PSNs for now.
608962	615646	Yeah, it's just, I don't know, how integral is this to the function of this product in the first place?
615646	619908	Like, is it really necessary that we have this account set up?
619908	623170	Or is this just to like, you know, pad the numbers or whatever?
624003	628107	Oh, they're they're claiming it's security, but I claim.
628107	634793	Oh, yeah, because all the steam games are so unsecure, you know, it's it's not possible to, you know, add any sort of security.
634793	645663	Yeah, I now the benefit the benefit of the doubt I could probably give was maybe some sort of cross play thing behind the scenes, but the game's already functioning.
645663	649746	If I'm not correct, if I'm mistaken, the game is already functioning with cross play, right?
650467	651929	Yeah, it's not like something they're working on it.
651929	655872	So I'm not sure that really because it's like, well, then you're doing it now.
655872	658535	So why do you need this to make that happen?
658535	662178	I would maybe have understood that if crossplay wasn't there yet.
662178	669926	It's always in the name of security, like everything, even patching out hacks or exploits on consoles is in the name of security.
669926	673329	You know, when they talk about that stuff.
673329	675051	Yeah, I mean, I don't know if
677228	677908	It sucks.
677908	685472	I mean, especially especially if you're looking at, you know, we had OK, let me put it this way.
685472	692816	So if you were going to do this, obviously they knew that they were going to do this because they said this was a grace period.
692816	702421	Then I assume that they took the proper precautions not to sell this game in territories that didn't have access to the PlayStation Network.
702421	704983	Because obviously, because they're only turning that around now.
704983	705223	Yeah.
705663	708524	Yeah, because obviously they must not have, you know, done that.
708524	722229	Now, on the other hand, if they did do that and sold essentially was something that they knew that was going to be shut down after a few weeks of service, then then I think those people are do a refund.
723200	728605	If not a class action lawsuit against you, because that's ridiculous to sell a broken product.
728605	734050	Yeah, but how's a class action lawsuit going to work when it sees it's not the US is not being affected?
734050	741157	So it gets complicated because you'd have to live in one of these affected countries and you'd have to sue a US company.
741157	744379	I would be I would wonder if maybe people would go after Steam.
745320	749763	I think that's the smarter strategy if you're a pissed off consumer.
749763	751945	And I realize this is not Steam's fault.
751945	752685	I want to be clear.
752685	756087	This is not Steam's fault.
756087	767615	You can't sue Target for selling a bed that the manufacturer has, I don't know, recalled a piece on.
768979	769940	Yeah, I guess.
769940	777243	But it seems weird that it's like, well, now this game that I bought on Steam has a restriction that didn't exist in the beginning.
777243	777684	I don't know.
777684	778024	I don't know.
778024	782506	But I mean, people- Bobby is saying in chat that Steam's offering a lot of refunds.
782506	782806	They are.
782806	788069	I was about to say, you can ask Steam for a refund and people are getting them eventually.
788069	791971	But as I understand it, people are not always getting them right away either.
791971	798175	Like this also should have been once this was announced and this loophole was discovered, this should be an open and shut thing.
798715	803739	everybody in those affected countries should honestly be automatically refunded.
803739	806301	It shouldn't be something you have to ask for.
806301	808483	But that's not going to happen.
808483	813166	Because if people are willing to hold on to a digital paperweight, then so be it.
813166	817409	Both companies would love to pocket that money.
817409	818610	Oh, yeah.
821397	823880	So I don't know, it's gonna be interesting to see.
823880	826043	Bobby says steam is legally covered.
826043	828827	So steam is legally covered as a follow up to the refund comment.
828827	836837	What it all it would take is one person getting the denial one time though, to then have something to go back.
836837	839120	Because if you ask one time to get told no, you could
839921	842222	you know, escalated if you really wanted to.
842222	847464	But again, I just don't know how practical that is when you consider it's international at this point.
847464	857949	You know, you're talking about companies that exist in the U.S., Japan, and then whatever other country is, you know, involved that may actually escalate it to this.
857949	868574	I just I think because of that reason, it goes nowhere and legally and it does end up, you know, the the court of public opinion, so to speak, as based on the steam reviews.
870154	876199	So it'll just be interesting to see what happens.
876199	886227	I do also agree with something Bobby said that Steam would also say the PSN requirement was visible on the store page.
886227	889290	If people decide not to read it.
889290	889990	True.
889990	896976	I would still say, though, there's a case to say why you sold a product that you knew wouldn't work for me.
896976	897136	No.
899941	901222	I'm not a lawyer.
901222	902943	Nobody on this panel is a lawyer.
902943	908788	I'm just I'm just, I've certainly seen enough of these wild lawsuits that come up over stranger things.
908788	910349	So it just it just wouldn't surprise me.
910349	911450	That's all.
911450	912851	I don't think it's Steam's fault.
912851	917815	But I also don't think these folks in other countries should just be forced to take it.
917815	919256	You know, and it's like you get it.
919256	920737	I think that's the frustrating thing.
920737	922118	What other recourse is there?
923680	927981	I mean, if there is no case legally, well, that fucking sucks.
927981	929621	Because what other recourse is there?
929621	932062	And we're sick of this shit time and time again, right?
932062	945985	Where we see these fat fucking companies making these decisions that affect swaths of fans in other countries, and there's literally nothing they can do about it.
945985	947445	This sucks.
947445	951546	There are recourses if the
953123	956534	countries themselves bring it up in international business court?
957793	959894	Do we have to get France to bail us out of this one too?
959894	966319	Because I seem to remember that was a strategy on a prior thing, was going to France, who has the strictest laws.
966319	967720	Can France bail us all out too?
967720	974344	I mean, I'm not a lawyer either, but I've taken several law courses that were associated with my degree.
974344	983510	Just saying, I got a bit of... I at least know about reading contracts and loopholes in contracts and things like that.
983510	987313	Just, I'm not, again, not an expert, but I do have the credits.
989914	998396	And what I was saying is that if it is there... Oh, and you should have seen me try to read the RuPaul's Drag Race contract.
998396	999737	Hoo, that thing's evil.
999737	1001617	Anyway.
1001617	1015842	But if it's stated there in the contract without anything else there to refute it, whether or not somebody reads it, the liability is still on the part of the signer, not the one who issued the document.
1016662	1029907	Unless there was... They could bring in for misleading verbiage in there, but they have professionals that read over this before they put the thing out.
1029907	1032748	And in the end of the game, I mean, it's...
1034824	1036545	read it before you sign it.
1036545	1040406	I mean, even with mortgages, you know, yeah, you get three day right of rescission.
1040406	1041527	That's one thing.
1041527	1048509	But still, once that right of rescission has passed, you have read the document, no matter what's in it, you are legally bound to it.
1048509	1060734	And so, so assumably, these professionals would have caught this loophole that, oh, you are going to sell a product in these countries that is effectively going to be inoperable.
1062894	1071258	They're on Sony's dollar, of course they're gonna... All they have to do, all their job is, they're not there for the ethics of it.
1071258	1074419	They are there for two reasons.
1074419	1083163	One, to legally make sure that the company is not held accountable for any fallout that comes based on the terms of that legal agreement.
1083163	1090607	And secondly, to make sure that that legal agreement is sound and has no conflicting language in it.
1091329	1097615	and that it can fall within, you know, whatever business law dictates.
1099090	1108839	Well, since I guess there's no other option than the court of public opinion, I would encourage these folks to take their negative reviews and apply them to all of the Sony games on Steam.
1108839	1111081	Why stop with Helldivers?
1111081	1120170	You should, if you really want to get them, get on the next Sony game before it releases or right at day one when it releases and get on those negative reviews.
1120170	1121691	That would be my suggestion.
1121691	1123533	If you have to find Dirty, find Dirty.
1126275	1141321	Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on the PlayStation, PlayStation games, studio games.
1141897	1143038	Okay, whatever.
1143038	1150724	Um, this is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling banning of players that engage in this type of behavior.
1150724	1156468	It also allows those players that have been banned to have the right to repeal or to an appeal.
1156468	1159130	So they already had that though.
1159130	1159670	Exactly.
1159670	1160831	Steam has that though as well.
1160831	1162933	So like, how is this necessarily
1163957	1165958	Improving gameplay.
1165958	1171662	Are they saying that, well, Steam is a hellhole and this is the only semblance of order?
1171662	1177846	I mean, if that's the Helldivers right there... Why spoil it on the platform if they have no confidence in the platform?
1177846	1192476	It's like the universe is just a rabid and awful uncivilized place and we're here to bring democracy by making you... Don't think that I agree with what Sony did.
1192476	1193657	It's just that
1196062	1197783	I follow the logic of it.
1197783	1200023	I mean, that's always going to be the take I'm going to go.
1200023	1204385	And I can empathize with people and say, yeah, it sucks that you're in this situation.
1204385	1209966	But in the long run, you know, how many server closures have we seen?
1209966	1215588	How many, you know, games that come out and then instantly, you know, don't sell.
1215588	1216768	And so they shut it down.
1216768	1221430	I mean, this is a lot of just business.
1221430	1225031	And honestly, I even think that maybe a degree of IP protection.
1226050	1230033	You know, it's Sony wanting to keep the control in-house.
1230033	1231835	Then don't put it on Steam, then.
1231835	1232275	I'm sorry.
1232275	1234377	Then, sorry, you don't get Steam sales, then.
1234377	1236098	You can't have it both ways.
1236098	1238841	You want to sell your game, but you also don't want to play by the rules.
1238841	1242504	That's what I was getting to, what I was saying.
1242504	1249750	You know, if they want to maintain that kind of control, then they need to have it on a platform that only they control.
1249750	1250150	End of story.
1252742	1254763	But yeah, that's exactly what I was getting to.
1254763	1260827	Sony's too lazy to put out their own store on the PC, so I guess, I don't know.
1260827	1270493	It doesn't make financial sense for them if the, you know, and they've had a working relationship with Steam before for, you know, the Final Fantasy games.
1270493	1280020	It very well could just possibly be that this is something that they were trying and it's gonna, you know, five, six days from now, you know, a week,
1280856	1289594	We're going to see them going, oh, we see how, you know, we've listened to our fans and we we love you and what you have to say and then reverse it.
1290769	1297752	I guarantee that it having the PlayStation Network account is not going to fix any hacking that's being done in the game already.
1297752	1306655	Being that they say outright in the actual little blurb that they put out that it's freaking easy to set up a PlayStation Network account.
1306655	1311817	So that's free and easy for me to set up multiple PlayStation Network accounts is essentially what you're telling me.
1311817	1314798	And so like, I don't see how that's going to prevent
1315638	1319740	people from banning or hacking or whatever the case may be with this.
1319740	1323622	And honestly, I think a lot of people are just like, nah, I'm not doing this.
1323622	1326023	I have a library of 800 games I got to be playing.
1326023	1331146	You know, if if I really don't like this and this is bothering me so much that I'm just going to outright not do it.
1331146	1336629	And now you take the reviews in your game, which was doing well.
1336629	1339270	I mean, that is going to financially hurt them at some point.
1339270	1344393	So hopefully they learned their lesson that maybe like be a little agnostic with it.
1346023	1365520	Questbuster with an interesting follow-up of sorts in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, while this is going on, Sucker Punch was spotted a day or two ago with a tweet affirming that the director's cut of Ghost of Tsushima for PCs, which comes out later this month, won't require a PSN account for single-player, but will for multiplayer functions.
1366141	1376488	there, we'll see that whole thing where I was like, you know, if you really want to show you're mad at Sony, go start review bombing other Sony games, like go go scorched earth on Sony period.
1376488	1390277	This tweet is trying to prevent some of that is trying to make it like basically like very clear, like you don't need it for single player, you know, you do like try to get out in front of a lot of that is what they're trying to do with this, which understandably so.
1390277	1395441	But as I understand it, Sony if they wanted to could also change this on a whim if they wanted to.
1396321	1400984	I don't think they will, especially in light of this, but they could.
1400984	1405167	And I would like to go ahead and just say this as for myself.
1405167	1410590	I don't think that it's a good idea to encourage anybody to review BOM for any reason.
1410590	1413072	Review the game based on the game.
1413072	1415774	You know, if it's a good game, it's a good game.
1415774	1419616	You know, you all are fucked and have no recourse whatsoever.
1419616	1421638	You have nothing you can do about it.
1421638	1423219	Sit there and take it.
1423219	1423499	No.
1425197	1428359	There is such a thing as writing letters.
1428359	1434184	And if and companies, they I mean, there usually is a business response policy.
1434184	1446513	But the best way to make your voice, you know, heard on this one is do the legwork, write the letters, you know, send it to the people who are in the power to do something about it for you.
1446513	1450536	You know, folks in the mailroom are just going to love that and they're going to throw it in the trash.
1450536	1451797	That does not happen.
1451797	1454099	It is legally not permissible to happen.
1455049	1457631	They have to be read by somebody and there has to be a response.
1457631	1460932	The impact will be seen.
1460932	1467456	All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it was Helldivers or otherwise.
1467456	1469057	Let's start with DarkSakura.
1469057	1471539	How was your gaming week?
1471539	1477262	I played... My Avatar game finally came back up, so I was really happy about that.
1477262	1478402	I played Dead by Daylight.
1480697	1481018	Dracula X
1490462	1501146	I actually kept playing after my stream was over just so I could get the Yotsutsuna, which people don't really like because of the defense drop, but it's like fast and you shred everything in front of you.
1501146	1504207	You don't need defense when you got a good offense.
1504207	1507107	Just saying.
1507107	1510309	And I also played Just Dance.
1512429	1513570	because Shiley made me.
1513570	1515231	We had Fuck It Friday last night.
1515231	1516332	Not last night, but Friday night.
1516332	1517573	You know what I mean?
1517573	1522676	And so I had to play Just Dance and we played Jackbox 7.
1522676	1525618	So we had some fun.
1525618	1532522	There was, you know, some some adult beverages involved and my friends over and that was really great.
1532522	1536965	I love I love the some of the Jackbox games now, although
1539699	1545826	A lot of people really like to submit the word vibrator as a suggestion.
1545826	1552473	I'll be appropriate for the next Jackbox.
1552473	1553754	That's what I played.
1553754	1554415	All right, Loki.
1554415	1558479	Yeah, I played all Minecraft this week.
1558479	1561982	I put out a video, so I built an arcade with a DDR machine.
1563157	1565919	It's a mind mind revolution game.
1565919	1566860	I saw the video.
1566860	1567341	It's cute.
1567341	1568201	Yeah, very.
1568201	1568842	Yeah.
1568842	1573266	As usual, way more than I would expect way more detailed than it had any right to be.
1574338	1576058	Yeah, pretty much.
1576058	1579959	So yeah, so that's what I've been spending time with this week.
1579959	1584220	And then it's still trying to get back to working on the theme park ride stuff.
1584220	1586621	So I did work on that a bit.
1586621	1595063	And in the middle, I played some of the MCC Island stuff to try to run in.
1595063	1601425	Well, we were playing with some of our listeners and I guess viewers.
1601425	1602045	And we were
1603194	1609935	Also trying to bump into some of the people practicing for the new MCC tournament that was yesterday.
1609935	1613716	I did see Cub, our coach.
1613716	1618997	He popped into the tab screen for a sec and then was off doing practice.
1618997	1621017	But yeah, it was fun.
1621017	1626418	We got to play Rocket Spleef Rush again, which I haven't played that since MCC.
1626418	1628599	And they've changed it now, so it's a little harder.
1629915	1631076	Fun game.
1631076	1635317	So looking forward to hopefully them adding more stuff to the island at some point.
1635317	1636998	Oh, Ace Race.
1636998	1637558	Got it.
1637558	1641080	I hope they get that there someday because that was a lot of fun to play Mario Kart.
1641080	1646202	But, you know, Minecraft, Minecraft, like parkour, I guess.
1646202	1648403	And yeah, so that's pretty much my week.
1648403	1653586	I didn't I don't think I played any of.
1653586	1653746	Rock.
1655407	1655848	TurboKid
1666532	1686119	My gaming week was honestly mostly Diablo 4 of all things and the reason why is because there's you know the season event going on and the season's over in like 10 days because there's a big new patch coming out for season 4 it's gonna really affect itemization in the game which is a huge sticking point for a lot of players right now so
1686559	1688960	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1709599	1721745	I think I will get there though there's 90 tiers of the battle pass and I hit 69 today literally did so I think I'll get there because there's a lot of they do this thing where
1722785	1749613	you get a little bit of credit for like everything you do in the world every monster you kill every you know dungeon you finish but then there's some other like quests that they call like the season journey and as you tick things off on the quest you kind of get a big chunk of uh you know a level or something like that so i'm really close to there's been a few that's been a bit of a grind but i'm really close to ticking the boxes on a few of those so that'll uh that'll really help so
1750413	1763202	Hopefully by this time next week, I'm going to be sitting here going yay, I got I finished my battle pass and I don't feel as clownery for spending the money on the battle pass in advance because I think I got everything in it.
1763202	1770907	But I there's also something I noticed was that they have not been offering tier skips through Amazon Prime this time.
1770907	1777991	And I think that's how I was able to get ahead a little bit was that Prime Gaming gave me at least like 10 tier skips last time around.
1777991	1780093	And I they didn't give the give us that this time.
1780653	1799758	What I did notice, I didn't even know this was a thing until I was just very randomly somehow in the Microsoft points thing, the reward points, you know, applications, seeing ways you could spend them because I think I saw that Diablo 4 was in there and I was like, oh, I was curious if you could like buy a battle pass maybe through your reward points.
1799758	1804879	No, but you can buy tier skips with your Microsoft reward points in Diablo 4.
1806159	1811903	And I don't, that's an interesting sort of Blizzard and Microsoft synergy thing.
1811903	1814885	I don't think existed before Microsoft bought them.
1814885	1816366	I think it's a ridiculous value.
1816366	1820529	They want something like 1700 points for two tier skips, which is not worth it.
1820529	1826193	But I thought I just thought that was interesting that that's something you could spend them on if you wanted to now.
1826193	1832498	I'll keep saving up for the gift card that gives me a month of game pass free, because I think that's the best value for me personally.
1832498	1832638	But
1833058	1834481	thought that was interesting that you can buy.
1834481	1843118	I was like, Oh, this is an interesting sort of Microsoft and Blizzard thing since the purchase that I hadn't heard about otherwise.
1843118	1844380	So this is interesting.
1845134	1846175	But yeah, it was really just that.
1846175	1848016	Final Fantasy XIV a little bit as well.
1848016	1851139	My ninja got to level 90, which is the max level in the game.
1851139	1853640	So I only have three classes left to get to max level.
1853640	1856423	Warrior, Monk, and Dragoon.
1856423	1857563	Dragoon's about halfway there.
1857563	1859024	I've been working on Dragoon lately.
1859024	1862927	So, and dying in a lot of fights because I'm a Dragoon and that's what they do.
1862927	1864489	So, good times.
1865270	1868432	All right, we got some more stories coming for you.
1868432	1873156	Looking in chat, Mike Depp says, a friend does the Microsoft Rewards thing almost religiously.
1873156	1875357	He has gotten a lot of stuff out of it for sure.
1875357	1882943	I used to be a little more on it when I was playing my Series X more because they had, they just shut it down not that long ago, they had that app.
1883423	1884304	Thanks for watching!
1905831	1910775	every other month I was getting Game Pass for free when I was doing it.
1910775	1914297	I think they took away a lot of methods to get points.
1914297	1916259	But there's still a lot out there.
1916259	1922743	And I'm sure it's it feels like some really weird version of extreme couponing.
1922743	1927627	If you find all these different coupons and ways to get points, you can get these free rewards.
1927627	1930229	That's really what people are doing like defs friends.
1930229	1931350	So interesting.
1932622	1937924	All right, anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, a lot of other stuff that's been happening in the industry this week.
1937924	1942446	And this is an interesting development from Loki.
1942446	1946328	Yeah, I don't.
1946328	1948149	What's the world become nowadays?
1948149	1950730	Like, that's the question we really should be asking ourselves.
1951719	1972452	Dave and Buster's, for those who are not aware, is a restaurant chain that's kind of think of like an adult Chuck E. Cheese that's got an arcade with like lots of redemption games plus they serve alcohol and they have a, instead of turning in tickets for things you can get on Xbox or I guess that's kind of all arcades nowadays that have redemption.
1972452	1973913	Or most of the drinkware in my kitchen.
1975054	1978115	Yeah, or like what Jamie said.
1978115	1983516	But now, now, don't worry if you're using that as an escape to get away from gambling.
1983516	1986396	Well, gambling was just following you right there.
1986396	1994598	So Dave and Buster is going to allow you to to place friendly wagers on various games using their app.
1994598	2001159	And they've partnered with Lucra, a gambling software company, to power their wager system.
2001159	2003160	And apparently it's going to allow you to
2005899	2018802	bet on skill based games and Lucrez said, of course, just to clarify that, hey, we're not running afoul of the law because you have to do that in great ideas like this.
2018802	2024023	They said skill based games are not subject to the same rules and regulations as slot machines or other types of gambling.
2024023	2030605	The company is careful not to use specific terms like bet or wager when talking about its software.
2030605	2034026	Instead, they use real money contests or challenges.
2037165	2041731	There's yeah, it's gambling hurt in the line, aren't they?
2041731	2052706	Well, like, when I originally heard about this, I thought, oh, maybe they're gambling tickets, you know, because you have a ticket balance on your card, and maybe you can make sure that would make sense.
2052706	2053968	But no, this is legit money.
2057554	2063317	But also, like, first off, number one, where is the the need for this?
2063317	2071421	Like, I know, like, I have never gone to an arcade and like bet someone money to do something like that has never crossed my mind at all.
2071421	2072482	Number one.
2072482	2080406	Number two, let's say a work going to do that in a conventional sense, you would have cash on hand to do that.
2080406	2082707	Why would I use your stupid app to do that?
2082707	2084568	Like, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
2084568	2085608	So it's
2086989	2088929	Solving a problem that's not there.
2088929	2094091	And it's also in introducing something that is a bit of irritating, if you ask me.
2094091	2101292	It's like preying on people's egos, because there's a lot of people that would go, Oh, I can win money from making the basket shot.
2101292	2103012	Heck yeah, I'm a basketball pro.
2103012	2103873	I can do this.
2103873	2104333	Easy.
2104333	2104753	Yeah.
2104753	2105593	Heck yeah.
2105593	2111354	Not realizing that, you know, the basket rims are usually different as well as the ball sizes and those types of, you know, things.
2111354	2114055	And there's all and sometimes they're even tilted a little bit.
2114055	2115995	There's all sorts of little... They're mid
2116015	2116535	Codeway Games
2137353	2139075	and DJ Ranma S
2153508	2156211	You know, whoever wins gets $5.
2156211	2159974	When you cash it out, they have to take cut, I'm sure, or something.
2159974	2166500	Or does the money then turn into credits or gift card money or something that- Or that maybe you pay a flat rate?
2166500	2169522	Maybe they show you how to cash it out?
2169522	2169903	I don't know.
2169903	2170503	It doesn't really say.
2170503	2173226	It says- Let's see here.
2174229	2175889	So there's real money wagers.
2175889	2183171	There's definitely a lot of questions that still need answering that I don't think we're really going to know until we actually see one of these go live in a Dave and Buster's.
2183171	2189592	But I personally, I haven't set foot in a Dave and Buster's and it was at least before the pandemic was the last time.
2189592	2194853	So, yeah, I don't see myself rushing to check it out.
2194853	2197274	Did that one that new one in Folsom finally open?
2197274	2197894	Yeah, it's open.
2197894	2199174	Oh, interesting.
2199174	2202115	Yeah, we drove by it going to Lucille's.
2202708	2202988	Dave's Closet
2223075	2225698	Yeah, there's there's this aquarium called SeaQuest.
2225698	2226539	It's awful.
2226539	2227660	Don't go there.
2227660	2232185	It's but it is there in the Palladio.
2232185	2234047	And I had no idea this was a thing.
2234047	2235488	Yeah, it's awful.
2235488	2237270	Like it was like, ooh, aquarium.
2237270	2238531	And then you go to it and you're like,
2239372	2245354	It's all manta rays and it's just the fish and there's farm animals in each other.
2245354	2253757	And apparently like if you like actually research sea quests and like there's a ton of like bad things about them.
2253757	2256518	And so it's just really not worth going to.
2256518	2260160	But I had no I was excited to see Dave and Buster's.
2260160	2266122	It's just like, you know, they have no card now and it's just the
2268081	2268761	It's just the app.
2268761	2270341	Everything's done through the app now.
2270341	2271802	Huh?
2271802	2278483	Yeah, I'll stick to round one, honestly, which I mean, SSJ100 Matt says in chat, just go to round one and play the claw games.
2278483	2278883	Interesting.
2278883	2292606	I mean, the claw games are interesting because in a way it's but see, it's, it's not betting the same way but it is it's like, you know, you only get rewarded if you have skill, you know, which, you know,
2293854	2298560	Well, if you know how to work a claw game, you might have a better chance or whatever.
2298560	2303405	Still RNG and skill kind of together, but at least that makes sense.
2303405	2306830	It's just, this is just predatory.
2306830	2310935	Well, we've been calling these ticket spitter things gambling for kids for years.
2310935	2311715	Now it's just gambling.
2312478	2312898	It is.
2312898	2314459	Well, now it's Gambler for Adults.
2314459	2315439	That's right.
2315439	2317460	Why should those aren't skill based?
2317460	2319861	They're talking about.
2319861	2328265	The like, like I just said, the skeeballs and the basketballs and maybe some whack-a-mole and some Cosmo gang, I don't know.
2328265	2334048	They will keep pushing the line more and more and more until some regulatory agency comes in and smacks it.
2334788	2344933	And I'm sure California, New York, one of these states, when this goes hot, is going to be right up this thing's ass.
2344933	2347394	Or possibly even legislating around it.
2347394	2355838	We've seen states legislate business practices out of existence, such as what California has been trying to do to clear at the airports, right?
2355838	2360740	Well, so this company Lucra also is partnered with, I mean, they've also
2361440	2362940	Duper, Pickleball Rating System, Tennis One
2379298	2381519	for a long time, it's never required an app.
2381519	2383140	It doesn't need to require an app now.
2383140	2385281	Like, I don't understand what the point is with this.
2385281	2387922	If you don't have cash on you to bet people, guess what?
2387922	2388943	The app is the shark.
2388943	2389583	Don't do it.
2389583	2392165	The app is the shark that makes sure you pay up.
2392165	2395066	The app is the invisible money you don't know you're spending.
2395066	2400709	Yeah, that that is a absolutely 100% that is a huge part of it.
2400709	2404831	If you don't actually hand physical money over, it doesn't feel the same.
2404831	2405311	Yeah.
2405311	2406512	Yeah.
2406512	2406812	All right.
2407503	2422776	Well, look, physical exchanges are very important to some people, which is why some people like to buy games from Limited Run Games and get to experience classic games, sometimes newer games, indie games, a lot of classic games that are getting a second print or Limited Run.
2422776	2433305	But Limited Run is in some hot water this week because, uh-oh, apparently some 3DO games were shipping on CDRs.
2433945	2438086	Yeah, like they were just burned in a computer and then went to somebody's house.
2438086	2441007	Yeah, not great.
2441007	2452931	So they've actually responded already with a statement saying, we've been made aware that some of our customers have experienced issues and trying to play our release of D the collector's edition on original 3DO hardware.
2452931	2456972	We'd like to apologize unreservedly to all who have purchased the game and experienced an issue.
2457512	2460856	At Limited Run, the quality of our products is paramount to us.
2460856	2466841	We care deeply about our loyal community, and it is clear on this occasion that we have fallen short of the high standards we set for ourselves.
2466841	2471546	Manufacturing games for hardware that's 30 years old presents a variety of challenges.
2471546	2479134	We partner with one of the biggest disc replication providers in North America to press our physical discs, and despite researching hardware and software extensively,
2479494	2484436	We found quality and reliability issues when attempting to press 3DO discs in the traditional manner.
2484436	2497343	In an attempt to offer full compatibility with original hardware, our disc replication partner was able to successfully manufacture the discs using a CD-R format, which we believed would work across all commercially available 3DO systems.
2497343	2503406	This process was professionally done and was used to ensure maximum compatibility rather than serve as a cost-cutting exercise.
2503406	2505327	This is very interesting how they're explaining themselves here.
2506280	2512945	We tested the discs on the 3DO consoles in our office and all 5 discs from the game worked as expected.
2512945	2518708	It was only upon shipping to our customers that we came to realize that some users were experiencing difficulty.
2518708	2525033	We will not be selling or shipping further copies of this game or any future 3DO titles until the situation has been resolved.
2525033	2526554	We are working with new partners.
2527074	2531197	Please be assured that D, The Collector's Edition, is the only game affected by this issue.
2531197	2534579	Further titles will not go into production until this is resolved.
2534579	2543645	So this is interesting that, you know, a lot of folks are reporting on the original story about how, you know, the things, you know, the production, the incident happened.
2543645	2547048	But that statement is interesting in putting things to perspective where they're claiming
2547588	2556670	you know, whether it is or isn't true, they're claiming that they had to go with CDRs because that was the only way they could get it to work on a mass scale on 3DOs.
2556670	2559250	But surprise, surprise, it didn't work.
2559250	2567711	I think it was less that and more of like, they, our manufacturer assured us that this would work, that they tested it, it did work.
2567711	2570632	And it wasn't as expensive as pressing the disc.
2570632	2574773	And so they're like, well, okay, well, we can do that then and it'll be fine.
2574773	2576773	And then it turned out it wasn't fine.
2576773	2576913	So
2578266	2587954	And they were upfront about it, so... Yeah, I mean, go figure that 3DO has probably anti-piracy built into its console like every other CD console, so...
2589271	2595292	Some interesting comments from around the internets, people not convinced about this explanation here.
2595292	2610756	Here's some comments that are coming around from Twitter at Oporpup says, The nature of CDR, which uses a layer of dye higher up in the disc's substrate than a writer etches away to approximate the pits and lands of a compact disc, is something that the 3DO's very primitive and delicate laser
2611156	2612456	really will not tolerate.
2612456	2614357	I know this from serving them.
2614357	2623199	Another user, IamHanyolo says, so you chose CDRs to ensure compatibility on a device notorious for not playing well with CDRs.
2623199	2626020	Can't make this stuff up.
2626020	2635262	So, you know, just a bunch of people kind of calling bullshit with this that, you know, they, despite the fact they tested it and it worked, you know, whatever.
2635262	2636322	So.
2636322	2636742	Hmm.
2636742	2639683	Also, it's kind of lame to have it on a CDR anyways, because
2641713	2644635	You could just burn your own copy if that's the case.
2644635	2654241	Like you're buying a game from Limited Run because you want it to be a physical copy that is equivalent to the release that it was originally.
2654241	2658104	Not like, oh, hey, I burned this on a disc before you made a fancy label for it.
2658104	2661606	Like, no, please don't do that.
2662769	2667492	But they are making good on their promise to stop 3DO games until they get this figured out.
2667492	2675458	sg100mat illustrating this in chat saying, Plumbers Don't Wear Ties, which that was a real 3DO game that's pretty wild.
2675458	2680381	Plumbers Don't Wear Ties was going to be a limited run release, but that has been delayed because it was a 3DO release.
2680381	2684023	So that is not happening, at least not right away.
2684023	2685705	So, until they figure this out.
2686385	2692529	Back to the drawing board and maybe back to testing with a pool of more than five 3DO machines or whatever.
2692529	2694851	I mean, I get they're hard to find.
2694851	2699754	If he's a plumber that doesn't wear ties, then why in the box art is he wearing a tie?
2699754	2701075	I'm confused.
2701075	2703116	This doesn't make sense.
2703116	2704137	Is he not a plumber?
2704137	2708820	You'll find out eventually, but it's going to be delayed a little bit.
2709520	2714463	It's like, wait, I thought you were supposed to be here to plumb my pipes and now you have a tie on.
2714463	2718405	Well, clearly you're not meant for this job.
2718405	2724568	3DO is one of those systems that just kind of came and went, and I don't think I ever touched one, except maybe at a Sears kiosk.
2724568	2727489	They sell 3DO at Sears, Montgomery Ward, one of those.
2727489	2730951	I think maybe a kiosk at one of those stores is the only time I ever played a 3DO.
2730951	2732112	Otherwise, no.
2733103	2736065	Bobby, the game is about why he shouldn't wear a tie.
2736065	2738287	Oh, so it's one of those instructional safety videos.
2738287	2742871	Like if you wear a tie, you'll get sucked into the paper shredder or something like that.
2742871	2743772	All right.
2743772	2744032	Wow.
2744032	2745153	Dr. Seuss says we had one.
2745153	2747114	There were a few great titles at least once.
2747114	2747775	That's cool.
2747775	2749596	Yeah, I guess.
2749596	2750777	Interesting.
2750777	2752599	Might be fun to get one and mess around.
2752599	2754500	But you know, you can't make your own CDR games.
2754500	2756062	That's for sure.
2756062	2757022	All right.
2757022	2757763	Anyhow, let's move on.
2757763	2759665	DarkSakura.
2759665	2759945	Well,
2762758	2771230	Hasbro has had licensing deals to put out some pretty amazing games.
2771230	2775076	I mean, well-performing games, I should say, like Monopoly Go and Baldur's Gate 3.
2776974	2782598	But now they are looking into building their own internal development.
2782598	2797288	The head of product development at Wizards of the Coast, which it's still hard to think of Hasbro owning that, but is really wanting to make the video games now.
2797288	2799830	They have four AAA studios.
2799830	2805754	There's Atomic Arcade that's doing a Snake Eyes game that's, I guess, it's supposed to be a little bit more adult themed.
2807074	2820939	There's Invoke Studios doing a Dungeons and Dragons, there's Skeleton Key that's doing quote something spooky, and then another one out of Austin called Archetype that has a BioWare
2823866	2833895	Star, I guess, from Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, whose lead designer, James Olin, is working on a new franchise, Exodus.
2833895	2836096	And to quote
2838308	2842432	Dan Ayub, who is that, again, head of digital product development.
2842432	2843813	I cannot speak words tonight.
2843813	2845234	Excuse me.
2845234	2846175	I'll read the quote.
2846175	2849999	Hasbro is a hundred year old company and it's built on play.
2849999	2853522	It's always been about play and it's always been about entertaining people.
2853522	2856624	And gaming is the predominant form of entertainment for a lot of people.
2856624	2859267	And it's something that just continues to grow.
2859267	2861989	So in a lot of ways, it makes sense for Hasbro to be in this space.
2863310	2874956	and they're really wanting to just make some very strong games and they really are pushing that Snake Eyes game, so who knows.
2874956	2876577	Yeah, it'd be interesting to see, you know.
2876577	2877558	I mean, they bought Atari.
2878143	2884547	Yeah, it'd be interesting to see how Hasbro kind of pushes this forward because obviously Baldur's Gate 3 was, you know, great for them.
2884547	2888369	But let's be we all know that's to Larian's credit, really.
2888369	2888769	Yeah.
2888769	2893812	And they're not going to be able to duplicate that with Baldur's Gate 4, to which Larian has already said, we're not doing it.
2893812	2896953	We're not interested, you know, that like they're they're doing the thing now.
2896953	2900815	So, you know, Hasbro wants to certainly cut out another type of hit here.
2900815	2903317	But these, you know, there's some interesting sounding things in here.
2903317	2904698	So I'd be curious.
2904698	2905198	For sure.
2905198	2905398	Yeah.
2907685	2920096	Apparently, some of the folks from Atomic Arcade worked on Batman Arkham Asylum, and they're trying to go that route with the Snake Eyes game.
2920096	2920737	That's a good game.
2920737	2924700	That should be pretty good.
2924700	2925060	All right.
2925060	2926822	Very complicated character in the G.I.
2926822	2929304	Joe universe.
2929304	2934849	Well, while Hasbro expands their plans, Loki has some unfortunate news on the other side of the spectrum.
2935592	2942834	Yeah, it's more updates regarding Take-Two and how we talked about it was rationalizing its pipeline and cutting hundreds of jobs.
2942834	2943914	Remember that?
2943914	2946575	$140 million worth of in-development projects?
2946575	2946815	Yeah.
2946815	2952737	Well, I think one of the things we forgot about was the indie studios that they own.
2952737	2964720	So part of that, of course, Take-Two has announced that they are planning to lay off 70 people in Seattle with Intercept Games, the makers of Kerbal Space Program 2.
2965900	2972046	And also Roll7 in London also said that they were getting laid off as well.
2972046	2980234	They were behind the recent, oh what was that, Olly Olly World and Rollerdrome.
2982392	2996828	So, unfortunately, Take-Two has actually said that they plan on making updates to Kerbal Space Program 2, and plans to release Weta Workshops Game Studios Tales of the Shrire, a Lord of the Rings game, the second half.
2996828	3000492	I think actually that was Private Division.
3000492	3001453	And then, of course,
3003436	3007859	Yeah, they're just not too happy about being laid off like that.
3007859	3012643	Roll7's co-director Simon Bennett told Edge that Olly Olly World was the sequel.
3012643	3015906	It was the best game we ever made, but it wasn't a totally new IP.
3015906	3019568	And it's been a long time since they've been in a headspace.
3019568	3028675	But it is, you know, they said, we're kind of tired of, you know, essentially playing publisher Tinder.
3030117	3035802	you know, trying to find new publishers to work with and just being bought up and laid off and stuff like that.
3035802	3036963	So that sucks.
3036963	3039785	Hopefully they're on to make the next big thing.
3039785	3044208	Yeah, one would hope because God's unfortunate to hear.
3044208	3052675	It's like, I guess take two is really putting everything into a Grand Theft Auto six being successful, you know, to save putting all your eggs in one basket.
3052675	3055578	So let's hope that that's a really good basket that those eggs are in.
3055578	3057900	I realize there's other stuff too, but it's just I don't know, it's hard.
3057900	3059441	It's hard not to kind of be like, Oh,
3059841	3062083	Rockstar Table Tennis is going to pull it out.
3062083	3063785	That sequel is going to be amazing.
3063785	3065046	It's going to revolutionize.
3065046	3065786	You know what they need to do?
3065786	3068028	Rockstar Games presents Pickleball.
3068028	3069189	That's the new thing right there.
3069189	3069970	There you go.
3069970	3070691	Oh, my God.
3070691	3075155	So I was at Target yesterday and Target has a whole fucking pickleball thing up front.
3075155	3076175	I know, I saw that.
3076175	3076556	Why?
3076556	3078337	I saw that.
3078337	3079418	I don't understand.
3079418	3085784	It's in, like, it's, we, every time I go for a walk, you know, the neighborhood park here has pickleball courts and it's just,
3086761	3088402	It's packed all the time.
3088402	3089742	It's the thing that the olds do.
3089742	3096145	When I when I go walking at parks playing Pikmin or Monster Hunter or Pokemon Go or any of that.
3096145	3098446	There's always people playing pickleball.
3098446	3100227	A lot of people are playing volleyball.
3100227	3101248	I noticed these days too.
3101248	3102889	It's kind of the time of year for that.
3102889	3107991	And always one person within those groups looking at me funny because I'm on my phone at the park.
3109482	3109682	Ma'am
3133843	3136085	Activities, people up out moving around.
3136085	3136825	Cool.
3136825	3139027	You know, I'm not and I'm sure some of you in chat play it.
3139027	3139928	That's cool.
3139928	3144432	But it's just it's weird to me how it's just everywhere all of a sudden.
3144432	3148595	Like, why is this like the hot new thing?
3148595	3148975	I don't know.
3148975	3150176	It's I don't know.
3150176	3156201	But then I get and then I get annoyed when people are judging me for being at the park playing the game I want to play.
3156201	3157922	That's that's the part that annoys me.
3157922	3162806	Like, I don't necessarily judge those people and they shouldn't judge, you know, other people.
3162806	3163487	But yeah, yeah.
3164641	3167584	Don't judge people for having fun in their own way.
3167584	3169386	How dare you have fun?
3169386	3174390	All right, let's talk about some indie ways to have fun.
3174390	3184420	ID at Xbox happened this last week, and it was a lot of different things that they showed at this event, which happened on Monday.
3184420	3188744	And let's go over some of the big announcements that they gave.
3189344	3194046	So Astor, Blade of the Monolith will be coming out on May 30th.
3194046	3204371	This was originally a game known as Monolith Requiem of the Ancients, but now this hack and slash ARPG has a new name and will come out on May 30th.
3204371	3209534	33 Immortals will have a closed beta that is starting May 24th.
3209534	3215176	If you're looking for a roguelike co-op game that you play with 32 other people, that's why it's called 33 Immortals.
3215176	3215757	Could be interesting.
3216757	3227344	Palworld, a game that I'm still shocked exists, quite frankly, is out there and is getting a new update with new pals this summer.
3227344	3234628	And I'm sure they will all look legally distinct from other companies' small monsters in their series.
3234628	3239051	But yeah, there will also be four new pals in this and apparently a flamethrower weapon
3239491	3239992	Commando's Origin
3259187	3265469	An 8.8 bit point and click adventure game called Centum is coming out this summer.
3265469	3272931	So if you like the old school sort of loom looking point and click games, this might be something up your alley.
3272931	3273871	Loom is so good.
3273871	3279713	I know it's kind of that eight bit like it gives me that those LucasArts vibes from the style here.
3279713	3283354	The game will shift between medieval and modern settings and it's out this summer.

3369845	3372846	This is the first Jackbox Naughty Pack.
3372846	3384168	We don't know what games are in it, but perhaps a- apparently the announcement trailer gives vibes of like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, one of those types of things.
3384168	3392230	So yeah, Jackbox Games making their own Naughty Pack, where now you are encouraged to have vibrator as every answer or whatever it is you want to do, so.

3538567	3539287	That's next week.
3539287	3541509	That's pretty exciting.
3541509	3546833	One other game, one last game, Dungeons of Hinterberg, a new trailer that has gameplay in it.
3546833	3551876	It is a social sim and action RPG with cell shaded graphics.
3551876	3552037	Neat.
3553092	3558053	So lots of stuff going on on the indie scene for Xbox and focusing on that this week.
3558053	3559653	But yeah, that was all the way back on Monday.
3559653	3561934	So a lot of those titles kind of hit socials.
3561934	3568115	I know that Jackbox Naughty Pack was everywhere, but a few of those other games in there definitely sound like they're worth checking out as well.
3568115	3571156	And again, Game Pass gets a lot of those indie stuff.
3571156	3578577	You know, if you happen to have Game Pass, take a peek in there once in a while, because they're always adding some new things that may be worth your time to check out.
3578577	3581658	All right, let's move on to the PlayStation side of the house.
3581658	3582078	DarkSakura.
3583995	3591180	So, have you ever wanted to just tell someone to play a game with you just by texting them?
3591180	3595622	Well, now Sony says you can do that with the PS5.
3595622	3601746	So if you want to invite someone into a game, even when they are not at their, you know,
3603066	3603346	Oh boy.
3617874	3619695	Mm hmm.
3619695	3627878	Like you want to like is that person you meet on social media and you just message them and go, Hey, come play with me.
3627878	3633300	But actually, it's going to come out later this year only for PS5 games.
3633300	3638641	And of course, those subscriptions, they went up in price.
3638641	3641382	So good luck.
3641382	3642403	They already fucked it up.
3644606	3651768	Um, I think it's interesting to have the more sort of, um, more ways of quickly jumping into someone's game.
3651768	3656889	I think especially, you know, via text message and, you know, sliding into someone's DMs.
3656889	3665490	Um, although I don't use Twitter, I know that when I use Twitter, yeah, there'd probably be people on there that I'd be like, Hey, yeah, like a game just came out today.
3665490	3666431	Let's party up together.
3666431	3666651	Yeah.
3666651	3667451	You seem pretty cool.
3667451	3669211	Like we've been mutuals on Twitter for a while here.
3669211	3670151	Here's the link, jump in.
3670151	3673072	And then that way you don't have to go, what's your game or tag or your,
3673632	3678737	PSN name, whatever it is, I'll add you or you kind of skip a few steps with that.
3678737	3679919	So I get it.
3679919	3686486	It's just, you know, I don't use Twitter, but I can you think how many people would be inundated though?
3686486	3688888	How much use for abuse this could be?
3688888	3689569	Oh, for sure.
3689569	3689889	For sure.
3689889	3691491	I think, you know, you'd want to
3692392	3695354	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
3711064	3714067	BlueSky is supposed to get DMs at some point.
3714067	3714868	And of course, Instagram.
3714868	3717230	I do use Instagram and Instagram has DMs on it.
3717230	3724558	You know, and yeah, there's probably a couple people in there that if they DM me a link to join a PlayStation game, I'd be like, Sure, you know, you're you seem cool enough.
3724558	3725339	Why not?
3725339	3730204	So my like the PlayStation games going to be Hey, do you want to buy some art?
3730204	3731765	Do you want to commission some art for me?
3732927	3735928	and it's every day, like almost every day.
3735928	3741250	I get so many anonymous, like on Discord especially, I get so many anonymous friend requests.
3741250	3743090	Pussy in bio?
3743090	3744051	No, it's not that.
3744051	3749832	It's it's it's they see that I'm a content creator and they try to they try to sell me artwork.
3749832	3755774	The problem is all of the artwork that they're trying to sell is not actually artwork that they've made.
3755774	3758655	It's artwork made through generators online.
3758655	3760456	And so it all looks the same.
3760456	3760676	It's like,
3761733	3761953	Discord
3785663	3787264	Hey, what's up?
3787264	3793650	And it's you know, I just shut off the fucking DMS on Twitter from people that I don't follow when I was on it.
3793650	3799214	But I checked to see if somebody is on the server with me on discord.
3799214	3803578	And one thing I've started doing is just being really passive aggressive about it.
3803578	3810784	I was like, Well, I'm so glad that you're like a real person and not just someone who only wants to be my friend to get me to commission work from them.
3812679	3813939	And it's one response.
3813939	3816600	Oh, good.
3816600	3817800	I got a response as well.
3817800	3818420	That was rude.
3818420	3827562	I was like, yeah, now imagine how I feel when I have a degree in this shit and you're offering to do your AI generated work.
3827562	3836624	It's it's it's only going to get worse with, you know, machine learning, these algorithms where they learn how to talk to people in DMs and stuff.
3836624	3837484	It's only going to get worse.
3838174	3843821	Yeah, it's, I mean, it wouldn't be so bad if like, they just said, Hey, this is what I want to do.
3843821	3847645	I've had one where they asked like, Oh, hey, I would like to draw some fan art.
3847645	3848686	I'm like, Okay, that's cool.
3848686	3850748	And they're like, Yeah, but it's gonna cost you $50.
3850748	3853171	I'm like, that's not fan art.
3853171	3854032	That's not how that works.
3854032	3855073	That's a commission.
3855073	3856675	Like, you don't understand.
3856675	3858117	Like, Oh, no, no, I'm good.
3859315	3861296	Fan art done by a fan.
3880425	3892090	And I'm always like doing like whenever I go live, I do like one everyone when I go live and leave it at that.
3892090	3897732	But I mean, I also go really try to promote a lot as much as I can.
3899986	3900826	Interesting.
3900826	3901167	All right.
3901167	3903928	Well, I guess I should be thankful I'm not getting these.
3903928	3909790	So I don't really I used to get I do get bullshit on Instagram all the time collab, collab.
3909790	3910510	You want to collab?
3910510	3914032	Hey, we're interested in featuring you and have a collab sell product free product.
3915754	3916354	All of it.
3916354	3920017	I'll do it if the free product is cool enough, but it's going to be an honest review.
3920017	3925201	It's it's and it's never or it's it's it's free product, but it's oh, pay us for it.
3925201	3927962	And then once you get I don't know what the scam because I don't respond to them.
3927962	3933766	So I don't know what specifically scam is, but I've read it's they say it's free, but you really pay them up front for it.
3933766	3936008	So.
3936008	3937249	I'm all like.
3938888	3947661	I'm going to say this as a blanket statement to anyone who wants to have us pay you to do stuff.
3947661	3950304	I do all that shit myself.
3950304	3952087	And I do it for us for free.
3953735	3956657	So no, the answer is no.
3956657	3960980	If you want to give us free artwork, though, because you love us, I'll take it.
3960980	3961940	Sure.
3961940	3963241	And we'll feature you.
3963241	3965003	We'll give you all kinds of props.
3965003	3967044	As long as it's not AI art.
3967044	3969746	There's been some rad stuff from listeners over the years.
3969746	3970967	There really has been.
3970967	3975169	But it's usually like it's what I would call, quote unquote, verified listeners.
3975169	3979092	And that's probably what Discord needs is some sort of verification system.
3979092	3982334	That's that's a beast that's probably too big for me to tackle, but.
3982334	3983355	Certified fan.
3983795	3996554	But you know, like, oh, a name I've seen in chat for 15 weeks is now sending something that's like, yeah, okay, you're like a verified, like, I know you're not just coming out of the blue, like you're actually somebody that's participated with the show.
3996554	3997355	That's different, right?
3998220	4022291	yeah remember the guy that made a text based adventure game like way back in the early that was that was there's been also well then I think of like I think of YYR Bungie ferret tossing kind of as a fan game and sorts I mean obviously he made it his own but uh you know it's very flattering so yeah all right anyhow let's move on just a couple more stories and then we'll get to the classic game of the week but first Loki
4023868	4043002	Alright, so as referenced in our intro, people have been exploiting the OpenStreetMaps to place beaches where beaches aren't because, you know, they want Pokemon that appear on beaches to be those fake beaches.
4043002	4050448	This brings me back to Ingress and early Pokemon Go days where people would have like, you know, significant
4051192	4056094	you know, your your mailbox as a significant point, you know, of interest and stuff like that.
4056094	4062337	It's still it's still those fucking little free free libraries, which as a concept I do like.
4062337	4068820	Like, I think little free libraries are cute things for neighborhoods and stuff, but they they do not all need to be pokey stops.
4068820	4076503	They are only appropriate as a pokey stop in a public park or public setting of some sort that's not a school like.
4076503	4077204	Yeah, that that.
4077944	4081668	Yeah, it's it's still there's still too many of those damn libraries.
4081668	4082629	It's for Wiglet.
4082629	4084291	Like, just let Wiglet go.
4084291	4084811	It's fine.
4084811	4090957	You know, but anyways, yeah, so they're manipulating any real world data to add more beaches.
4090957	4095942	And because they figured out that these Pokemon spawn at beaches.
4095942	4100127	So, yeah, it's essentially what they've been doing before with like, you know, saying, Oh, hey, this is a park.
4100127	4102029	But now it's, you know, this is a beach.
4103163	4105805	Oh, my kids are being extremely loud behind me.
4105805	4107687	Like all I hear is like a table moving or something.
4107687	4108328	It's fine.
4108328	4112451	It they're just it's it's and I don't think I said it on air yet.
4112451	4114353	But you do have a new microphone tonight.
4114353	4118036	So if Loki's voice sounds a little different than it used to, it's because he has a new mic.
4118036	4122339	But but I have an XLR mic now and a mixer and it's it's fancy.
4122339	4123581	It's also to me.
4123581	4123701	Yeah.
4124221	4125883	Probably pick some more stuff in the background.
4125883	4128085	Yeah, it is very sensitive.
4128085	4128466	Yes.
4128466	4128746	All right.
4128746	4130288	Well, back to editing the map.
4130288	4145304	Yeah, this was people were exploiting the OpenStreetMap once they found out, you know, the correlation got figured out that that that Niantic was using OpenStreetMaps to basically feed all the data, people would create parks because nests, nests
4146606	4149868	Pokemon nests at parks used to be a much bigger deal.
4149868	4160297	It's still technically a game mechanic, but I feel like people really care way less about it because most of the Pokemon that tend to be in this nest are not really special Pokemon.
4160297	4161779	They're kind of commonplace.
4161779	4164421	So I feel like people kind of care less about that.
4164421	4169025	But I remember in the earlier days of Pokemon Go, it was a big fucking deal to be able to have a nest nearby at your park.
4169685	4170666	Dratini, Dratini, Dratini
4189229	4193051	Yeah, they were like having security like try to throw people out and stuff like that.
4193051	4195812	Because you know them HOA Karens got furious.
4195812	4198274	Those HOA Karens got furious.
4198274	4208559	And I'm sure they were chatting on Facebook and their HOA Karen groups to talk about how these people would drive by in their car slowly by my house because they're thinking about robbing me.
4208559	4210660	And no, they're just playing Pokemon Go.
4210660	4212541	But you know, you shouldn't drive and play Pokemon Go.
4212541	4212761	But
4213281	4214943	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4229261	4232706	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4246365	4255533	But yes, the beach thing is interesting because of this particular new Pokemon wiglet that will only spawn at beaches.
4255533	4263020	And so people are creating beaches in their backyard by their pool, and these other sorts of silly things.
4263020	4264801	But here's the gag.
4264801	4267183	Pokemon Go only imports that
4268061	4273423	OpenStreetMap data like once every six months, it's very rare they actually update the data.
4273423	4276605	And then when they update the data, they're usually using old data.
4276605	4280406	So you're trying to add these beaches, it's not going to it's going to take like nine months.
4280406	4285748	And by then there will have been like a wiglet spotlight hour or something, there'll probably be another way to get these things.
4285748	4293852	Or there'll be a special event that cause oh, it's come on down to the summer event and Pokemon Go where Pokemon normally found at beaches will spawn everywhere.
4295367	4299470	It was sort of like when you had your country specific ones.
4299470	4301251	Oh, they still got that.
4301251	4301912	Yeah.
4301912	4313880	But well, but yeah, like Heracross, as an example, used to be one that you could only get within, I think, between the two, like Tropic of Capricorn and Tropic of Cancer.
4313880	4317542	I think I think Heracross only spawned in between those two.
4317542	4324507	Something like that was, you know, I don't want to say the equator because it was a much bigger line than that, but basically, you know, a big thick line around the center of the earth.
4325548	4326568	is where Heracross was won.
4326568	4335835	But they've had these events now, where like, because Mega Evolution Heracross was in raids, you could just go raid a Heracross down the street and get them now.
4335835	4339578	So like, eventually, even the regionals seem to show up.
4339578	4339758	But
4340609	4342130	People like to have them first.
4342130	4344711	People like to show off their little digital trophies.
4344711	4345852	I get it.
4345852	4347553	I have found one.
4347553	4349054	So I actually went in because I was curious.
4349054	4350715	I was like, well, what are the beach spots around here?
4350715	4357738	Because I was also like, that probably drives the Pikmin beach data too, because I could use some more of those.
4357738	4362041	And there's like one spot here in Sacramento.
4362041	4363862	Well, there's one in somebody's backyard.
4363862	4365903	What about spots at Folsom Lake?
4366539	4369920	I didn't see, I didn't look that far east.
4369920	4371861	I didn't look that far east to look at Folsom Lake.
4371861	4375842	I was trying to look like what I was assuming maybe the rivers would have stuff.
4375842	4377522	I mean, Lake Dantoma has a beach.
4377522	4380083	I would be wouldn't be surprised if there was a beach there.
4380083	4388685	The only one I found near downtown was Discovery Park, which technically does have a beach Discovery Park where they do aftershock and all that.
4388685	4394707	If you go to the west side, there's like a beach there a little little beach, but it's there and that is actually in Pokemon Go.
4394707	4394847	So
4395879	4399321	Yeah, a beach isn't a kiddie pool with a sandbox next to it.
4399321	4399601	Sorry.
4399601	4403023	No, no, this is, yeah, this is legit, like, river, river beach.
4403023	4405924	So, uh, yeah, that, that, that'll be the place.
4405924	4411407	And you know, the other way I figured out that it's legit, because Niantic's Campfire.
4411407	4412567	Remember that that's a thing?
4412567	4418831	Niantic put out their own social media app that they're grossly underutilizing, but whatever, because it's, it's kind of,
4419793	4427922	Like it tries to be Discord but it's like Discord but clunky and with no features.
4427922	4439595	So they have Campfire and you can post pictures of things you found on Campfire which are GPS stamped and so people are really silly and posting things they catch at their house all the time which is a terrible idea but
4440336	4445799	I also looked at that beach in Campfire and somebody posted the wiglet they found there.
4445799	4454243	So it is an interesting way to sort of confirm, oh, this is where people are finding things because people post random shit to Campfire with the Pokemon creatures.
4454243	4457185	So it is working then if it's not updated every six months.
4457185	4459026	Apparently it is updating a little bit faster.
4460026	4464108	I'm assuming because Discovery Park is legitimately a beach over there.
4464108	4466529	It's small as hell, but it's legitimately beach.
4466529	4470391	It probably was just in the data years ago because it is it should be a beach.
4470391	4471152	It's legitimate.
4471152	4471912	Yeah.
4471912	4479096	But yeah, that seems to be the one place now the person's backyard in the middle of Rancho Cordova or wherever I saw that.
4479096	4482138	I don't know if that's actually a spawning beach, but, you know, I think
4483358	4498011	it's it's like having the pokestop in front of your house at first it sounds like a good idea but then when that becomes a gym you're gonna have random trucks running their engine at 3am out front of your house to take the gym back like it's don't do it anyway
4499861	4506884	Let's move on because I find this one very interesting and people are reading a lot into this off of very little, but let's talk about what it is.
4506884	4508425	This is actually shared in our Discord.
4508425	4512067	I think it might have been in Bobby's channel, but too bad I stole it because we do that.
4512067	4513007	He does it to us too.
4513007	4514608	So we steal from each other.
4514608	4516529	Stories posted over on our Discord server.
4516529	4520291	You should visit our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4520291	4521972	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4521972	4526614	And apparently there has been a very interesting rating by the ESRB for Nintendo Switch.
4527014	4534418	It's a game called Nintendo World Championships NES Edition, and it's been given an E rating by the ESRB.
4534418	4541921	And in the description it says, this is a collection of 2D challenges and platformer games in which players traverse through various modes.
4541921	4544303	For example, speedrun, survival.
4544303	4550606	Several challenges involve reaching specific points, while others prompt players to defeat small enemies or survive brief battles.
4551306	4557550	Some games depict pixelated characters using small swords or arrows to strike at enemies.
4557550	4560072	Enemies typically get stunned or disappear in a flash.
4581806	4590332	I don't see how you get to that conclusion when part of this says, pixelated characters using small swords or arrows.
4590332	4592773	Okay, Rad Racer, no arrows.
4592773	4595455	Mario Brothers, or Super Mario Brothers, no arrows.
4595455	4597076	Tetris, no arrows.
4597076	4600658	Yeah, I don't think it's the 1990 cart.
4600658	4602539	Here's what I think is happening here.
4605166	4608247	If we get a Switch 2 this year, then cool.
4608247	4609687	This could still be a thing this year.
4609687	4620131	But remember when I was talking about how if Switch 2 isn't happening until next year, they're going to need to come up with these cutesy little ideas to try to hold us over.
4620131	4622651	Keep selling the Nintendo Online subs.
4622651	4628193	Do these things that could be low effort, high reward, sort of Nintendo leaning on their IPs.
4628593	4632657	to kind of create these things that would, you know, cause interest in the Switch.
4632657	4647890	Now, imagine a game using the branding and the IP of Nintendo World Championships that gets announced in June at a Direct, but maybe it's a Nintendo World Championships with new games from Switch Online.
4647890	4652854	I mean, I'm giving Nintendo a lot of credit here, but imagine
4654212	4661717	Maybe there's several different challenges that, dare I say, rotate weekly or monthly that you could do.
4661717	4670442	Like, you know, people are making the comparison to NES Remix, which is great, but I don't even necessarily know they have to go so far as to, like, remix and do things to the game.
4670442	4676066	I think maybe if they just take that same idea of having the little portions of the game.
4676066	4680649	And yeah, yeah, RecordWN in chat says, this is the lowest, lowest effort possible.
4681269	4686603	Yes, and we would still be applauding Nintendo for taking it because it's like, congrats, you tried.
4686603	4688769	But I think there would be a lot of people that would be into this.
4689740	4694401	Just do the, was it WarioWare, but like, you know, Nintendo game clips.
4694401	4696241	I don't even necessarily think it has to be that.
4696241	4701983	Like, just take the concept of Nintendo World Championships, but apply it to new games.
4701983	4705784	Beat stage one, and I'm literally going to pull games out of my ass.
4705784	4709784	Beat stage one of RC Pro-Am.
4709784	4713185	Beat the first level of Wario's Woods.
4713185	4716986	And then collect as many rupees in Zelda as you can before time runs out.
4717932	4721341	There, I just made what could be the challenge for the first week.
4721341	4724209	And then, and I know this requires Nintendo to be online,
4725922	4731864	So we're going to just, we're going to form our prayer circles and we're going to light our candles and make our wishes and summon the devil.
4731864	4736025	Let's look at our sundials and see if, you know, it's been like 20 years since online has happened.
4736025	4742627	Maybe Nintendo will have online leaderboards for this, where you can compete against your friends.
4742627	4751990	And it might be a fun thing for streamers to play, you know, going for the challenge, you know, especially if they rotated it every week or something like that.
4751990	4754331	I think that could be how you'd have- You'll tie into your prodigy accounts?
4754611	4758216	Nintendo World Championships, but like modern.
4758216	4765246	I would love it for me to go a step further and like actually do the NES remix thing and like the cartridges are doing different things.
4765246	4770414	But like Wrecker WN said earlier, I'm giving you the lowest effort possible idea that could still be pretty cool.
4772132	4774213	Thank you, you're all very kind in chat.
4774213	4776934	SGO100Math says Rob Stradamus is going to strike on this.
4776934	4779235	DarkJosiah says, now I really hope Rob is right on this one.
4779235	4779736	Hire Rob.
4779736	4784498	Well, you all are very sweet, and my ego is very large, and my feed in Nintendo would be very cheap.
4784498	4786699	And RecordWN simply states, it won't be this cool.
4788450	4811100	I you're right but I wish I wish you weren't like again like we just said this this doesn't seem like it would be a huge effort right like use the ROMs you already have to do anyway that would be a good Nintendo World Championship or you know Congrats you put in the minimum effort Nintendo World Championship
4812639	4821086	But I wonder if it isn't something that they're sitting on for a June Nintendo Direct reveal that will be a, it's out today type of thing.
4821086	4824489	I think that would be the thing to do.
4824489	4826411	I saw that DarkSakura, thank you.
4826411	4829474	DarkTosia says, I'm sure Rob's in the ballpark at least.
4829474	4830174	Well, I hope so.
4830174	4830855	I'd like to be there.
4830855	4836580	Or even worse, it's just something that they have at their event and it's not actually a game you get to play.
4836580	4837521	Oh, fuck off.
4838735	4855807	but you're you might be right like you really might but like honestly fuck off but it's the swords and arrows what there there were no games in the 90s cartridge that had arrows I'm not even trying to think I'm even trying to think of this because wasn't there another one did they do another championship cart after that
4856923	4859245	Was there a Super Nintendo one, or am I making that up?
4859245	4860666	There was, I think, a second one.
4860666	4862228	I think it's a hallucination.
4862228	4863088	Maybe.
4863088	4866431	Am I doing that whole, like, making up the movie with Shaquille O'Neal?
4866431	4867032	Or who was it?
4867032	4867953	No, it was Sinbad.
4867953	4871496	Making up the movie with Sinbad that doesn't exist, but, like, I swear to God I saw a trailer for it.
4871496	4874539	I'm like, I'm doing that with the Nintendo World Championships.
4874539	4876180	What's in that tea you're drinking?
4876180	4877761	Does it look like bits of mushroom?
4877761	4878482	Just saying.
4878482	4879083	No.
4879083	4879803	Maybe.
4879803	4881545	Yeah, like the Sinbad Genie movie?
4881545	4882325	Exactly, that.
4882325	4882746	It's that.
4884426	4891650	And it was, and I have like a mental image of having seen something that it was likely a mock-up.
4891650	4892331	Yeah.
4892331	4893291	It's funny.
4893291	4893612	Anyway.
4893612	4894372	All right.
4894372	4898635	Well, let's take a time and travel back to something that isn't a hallucination.
4898635	4905439	Or maybe it was because it never actually happened because once a month, DarkSakura turns this segment on its head and says, you know what?
4905439	4911663	Instead of doing a classic game in a month, I'm going to do a classic game you never got to play because it was canceled.
4911663	4912563	Yeah.
4912563	4913023	Let's get to this.
4913023	4913784	Sucks to be us.
4924577	4932347	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4932347	4936893	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4936893	4938635	Alright, this one.
4939798	4944220	DarkSakura, this one is going to piss a lot of people off this week.
4944220	4945821	It's a stab in the feels.
4945821	4946102	It is.
4946102	4952825	This is going to make a lot of people very angry remembering that this game was canceled, but it is absolutely... But you know what it was canceled for.
4952825	4957068	Yeah, it is absolutely a worthy addition to this segment.
4957068	4959109	What is the game, DarkSakura?
4959109	4961630	The game is Scalebound.
4961630	4962871	Ow.
4962871	4963151	Yeah.
4964102	4974951	An action role-playing game developed by Platinum Games in work from 2013 until it was cancelled in 2017.
4974951	4983558	It was supposed to be released in 2017 for Windows and Xbox One, but it was announced as cancelled in January 2017 by Microsoft.
4985900	4996945	So, the game would be in a third-person perspective where you play the main character, Drew, going through the world of Draconis.
4996945	5009210	You have a dragon named Fubon, who would be your bestie, and you're bonded, and so if one of you died, the other would die as well.
5011291	5018396	Your dragon was controlled by AI, but you could give commands to the dragon during attacks.
5018396	5024961	You could also enter dragon link mode that let you directly control the dragon from the dragon's perspective.
5024961	5030505	And so it would shift to first person and it makes Drew vulnerable to attacks.
5031326	5037008	So you have three kinds of dragons with different abilities.
5037008	5041590	And they can be blended together with customization.
5041590	5049974	And you can basically just make your custom dragon from any combination of these different elements.
5049974	5054596	Then you can eventually ride the dragon, though not at the start.
5055396	5059817	And then there's special elemental attacks they have in their berserker mode.
5059817	5064298	And you could upgrade the abilities with gems that you pick up from enemies.
5064298	5070239	And then there's also different melee weapons.
5070239	5081602	And sometimes it's saying that the weapons will become degraded and lose their durability, very like what was going on in the more recent Zelda games.
5084713	5092296	And then of course you have large enemies that you can climb onto and smack around, and the main character has a dragon arm.
5093286	5113836	that can get information or do pulse energy or heal the dragon and then you can also shapeshift into a half dragon and you have skill points to level up and all kinds of just stuff and a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode and just all kinds of fun.
5115357	5131244	So, like I said, it was in development by Platinum Games, and the concept was actually created when Platinum was established in 2006, but then they went with Bayonetta instead of Scalebound.
5131244	5134385	And so they tried again after Bayonetta,
5135197	5140181	and they had a prototype, but everyone was like, eh, so they did the wonderful 101.
5140181	5148347	Then after that, they revised the idea and got the okay to start development in 2013.
5148347	5157995	So, Kamiya Hideki, he was really excited about this, but it was something that they had never worked on before.
5157995	5163079	They wanted to create a game that would be like no other game that Platinum did,
5163669	5167873	something that ended up being a real big challenge for the studio.
5167873	5173118	He also called it a collaboration between Platinum and Microsoft.
5173118	5183048	They wanted to have action in the game, but not as the core of the game, but that the combat will be at high quality.
5184037	5202902	and that they were putting more of an emphasis on graphics and visual quality to make it as photorealistic as possible and to be more accessible to new players that, you know, they could reach more people with this fantasy, you know, environment.
5202902	5210624	And then, of course, they also worked with Microsoft's user research labs to be sure that it would be to a lot of people's taste.
5212565	5219049	It would be the first action roleplay game developed by Platinum and a dream come true for Kamiya.
5219049	5224073	I always wanted to have a dragon companion.
5224073	5227775	Of course, this is me saying, what about Panzer Dragoon?
5227775	5229276	Hello?
5229276	5230377	Panzer Dragoon?
5230377	5231618	Anybody?
5231618	5240084	But anyway, the idea, though, for the bond between the protagonist and the dragon was not originally planned.
5241198	5258902	But they wanted to increase the player participation in the game, and so they had the story be Drew's and the gameplay on Thuban, but the two together were the main story.
5258902	5261083	And also it was going to be a dinosaur game at some point.
5262814	5265275	And Nihoo.
5265275	5275858	Some of the inspirations for this was Sorcerian, which was off the Dragon Slayer.
5275858	5287622	There was also a game on the PC, 8801MA, Hydlide 3, which we got some of those other games in the series here in the US.
5287622	5290483	And then some of the dragons out of Dragon Quest.
5292163	5303047	Also, there was this pulse energy in the game, and that was directly inspired by the Force from Star Wars, hence why I picked this game.
5303047	5305027	And it would be non-linear.
5308707	5313350	They had really put a lot of work into the world.
5313350	5316472	80% of it was based off of Earth's landscape.
5316472	5322056	And there's 20% that were environments that the pulse energy had shaped.
5322056	5326359	So there was just so much work into this.
5331548	5335152	The game, however, it missed E3 2015.
5335152	5342999	They did show gameplay at Gamescom 2015 with Crackdown 3 and Quantum Break.
5342999	5351327	They announced the cooperative four-player multiplayer mode, and they had the release set for 2016.
5351327	5354690	It was delayed to 2017, and then it was canceled January 2017.
5358044	5375095	The head of Platinum, Inaba Atsushi, said that it wasn't easy to see Microsoft getting criticisms because he felt both sides failed and that the game, quote, didn't do all the things we needed to do as a developer.
5375095	5384741	So they still, Microsoft still owns Scalebound, but Platinum would love to return to keep working on it if Microsoft would let them.
5385641	5401169	And then the last thing is that in an interview with Cutscenes, Kamiya apologized for the game's cancellation and that the development team wasn't experienced enough in creating an online featured game.
5401169	5407593	So there are some concepts, though, from Scalebound that showed up in Bayonetta 3.
5407593	5409194	Oh, interesting.
5409194	5409474	Yeah.
5411243	5415886	Yeah, because this game, you know, looking at the alpha footage that you know, is playing while we're talking about the game.
5415886	5417006	It looks neat.
5417006	5421149	Like I just like, yeah, but I get maybe it just really ran poorly online.
5421149	5425311	Or, you know, there's probably parts of the game that weren't optimized well, because they didn't have the experience with it.
5425311	5426412	But that's a bummer.
5426412	5428073	They couldn't make it come together.
5428073	5430194	But yeah, it looked fun.
5430194	5432855	But I yeah, don't don't release a game if it sucks.
5432855	5433476	Yeah.
5433476	5435697	So they came to that conclusion.
5435697	5436818	It wasn't as fun as it looked.
5436818	5437038	And yeah.
5437881	5449508	But, I mean, I can see where it draws influence from some of those, some other games, but I honestly think, though, that this concept might have influenced games that came after it was cancelled.
5449508	5461835	You know, not just, like, the bits that showed up in Bayonetta, but, I mean, I see some elements that could go with the later Panzer Dragoon games.
5461835	5463096	I see, uh,
5464773	5475643	Oh gosh, there's another game I can't think of off the top of my head, but where you, you know, you have, uh, other assistant, you know, characters work with you.
5475643	5477745	So it looks like it's really neat.
5477745	5480348	I get big Xenoblade vibes for some reason, but yeah.
5480348	5484211	Uh, yeah, some, but I want a dragon.
5484211	5485573	Who doesn't?
5485573	5485933	I know.
5485933	5489256	It's like Fantasy Star and the dragon is his mag.
5489256	5489557	Ooh.
5491550	5497852	All right, well, there it is, a game you're never going to play, Scalebound, your classic canceled game of the month.
5497852	5499952	Sorry, not sorry, because it's not my fault.
5499952	5500572	No, it's not your fault.
5500572	5501693	I'm just telling y'all about it.
5501693	5504594	You should know about this and then write Microsoft.
5504594	5506974	How terrible it was that this is gone.
5506974	5507814	Open letter.
5507814	5509015	We won this game.
5509015	5512476	There's always these random rumors that pop up that the game's getting revived.
5512476	5520738	I think a lot of it's wishful thinking, but wouldn't that be a gag if somebody took this concept, like just a different studio, took this concept and made a new game?
5521877	5522778	I got it.
5522778	5523838	I got it.
5523838	5526120	New Orange Lounge campaign.
5526120	5527521	Scalebound.
5527521	5530183	Make it so.
5530183	5531443	I don't think we'd be alone on that one.
5531443	5532244	I think a lot of you.
5532244	5541510	I mean, obviously I want the game to be good, but, you know, I'm kind of reminded of, in a way, I'm reminded of Final Fantasy XV.
5543152	5550378	And the reason why I say that is because, of course, XV started as Final Fantasy XIII Versus and had a completely different director in the beginning.
5550378	5559906	This game was in development for ten years, but we all know, no, the real game was in development for like three years because they pulled the plug on whatever they were developing before.
5559906	5566311	And because the product that ended up coming out, if you go back and look at that very first announcement trailer for Final Fantasy Versus XIII,
5567572	5591256	like there's like the characters are the same and there's parts of it that look familiar in the settings but like the actual gameplay is like what the fuck is this you know it's different so it'd be interesting if you know the concept of Scalebound came back as like a new type of title but I think I have I have an idea for a new name for it what hey bitches I got a dragon fuck off I'd play that wouldn't you
5592455	5600758	Well, I keep thinking of the movie How to Train Your Dragon, but maybe it's like how to train your dragon dot dot dot to kill your enemies or something.
5600758	5601818	I don't know.
5601818	5602459	Excuse me.
5602459	5603319	Excuse me, TikTok.
5603319	5604059	Unalive.
5604059	5606720	Unalive your enemies.
5606720	5609621	You know what, people?
5609621	5612262	I'm not mincing any words.
5612262	5613543	So.
5613543	5614123	All right.
5614123	5615444	I'm just not going to say it right now.
5615444	5616524	I don't know why I'm not blinking.
5617372	5625820	Alright, let's move on and travel around the news sphere quickly with some rapid fire news.
5625820	5627181	Some other quick headlines for us.
5627181	5627422	Loki.
5628803	5633906	Yeah, so we have news that the Xbox Gaming Showcase is going to be on June 9th at 10 a.m.
5633906	5635406	Pacific Time.
5635406	5648113	And they're going to show off a bunch of different games that are coming for Xbox, including New Gears of War and, you know, Microsoft Flight Simulator Avowed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
5648113	5656617	And then there's supposed to be also a Call of Duty director showcase or whatever they want to call it right afterwards.
5656617	5656777	So.
5657688	5660089	Yay!
5660089	5671754	And then, I don't know why this is a thing, but apparently 7-Eleven and Tetris are collabing right now.
5671754	5673855	Why should they, really?
5673855	5677217	You can get t-shirts and merch.
5677217	5680098	They did 7-Eleven exclusive Funko Deadpool pops.
5681573	5686596	Well, you can now get a Slurpee cup that you can play Tetris on.
5686596	5690918	Now, to be fair, it's not really a Slurpee cup because you can't put Slurpee in it.
5690918	5695921	It is just a fake Slurpee cup that lights up, but it has Tetris on the side of it.
5695921	5697662	It's 30 bucks and it's available.
5697662	5701104	I kind of don't need that.
5701104	5704146	I would be more curious than like what you can hack this thing to do, but.
5704146	5707508	That's right, you can put Doom on it.
5707508	5708288	Probably could.
5708288	5709569	Linux!
5709569	5710290	Probably could.
5710290	5710790	Probably could.
5711502	5715383	Funny enough, on my way home from ballet, I do pass a 7-Eleven.
5715383	5716903	I should look.
5716903	5719524	Well, this is available through their website, just to be clear.
5719524	5722545	I don't think they actually sell this in store.
5722545	5725005	Although, if I do see this in store, I will be picking this up.
5725005	5725866	I'm laughing.
5725866	5730607	FifthDream's tinfoil hat theory here in chat over at Twitch.tv, social VOG Network.
5730607	5733908	FifthDream says, 11 minus 7 equals 4.
5733908	5734908	4 equals Tetris.
5734908	5735448	I solved it.
5737389	5742371	Maybe we'll get an exclusive version of Tetris called Slurptris.
5742371	5744771	Will it have the kill screen?
5744771	5754534	It'll have all the different Slurpees and maybe different 7-Eleven gas station items that you can line up.
5754534	5754794	I don't know.
5754794	5757055	If we can have Hatchris, we can have anything.
5757055	5759296	RecordWN in chat calls it a boomer shooter cup.
5761095	5763656	If we put Doom on it, it'll be a Boomer Shooter Cup.
5763656	5765517	All right.
5765517	5766157	Let's move on.
5766157	5766997	You know what?
5766997	5768177	What?
5768177	5768838	Stuff.
5768838	5769358	There we go.
5769358	5770058	That's all.
5770058	5771599	Well, what do you have then for us, DarkSakura?
5771599	5772699	You can change the topic.
5772699	5775760	Something cooler, you know?
5775760	5778381	How about Rest and Saga?
5779702	5781363	Reston Saga is coming to Switch on May 2nd.
5796409	5804175	Um, and you can get it, uh, for the Arcade Archives by Hamster.
5804175	5817865	And the original game was released by Taito in 1987, where you play Raston the Thief, who looks a lot more like Conan the Barbarian and who has to beat up a dragon.
5817865	5820467	Legally distinct Conan the Barbarian.
5820467	5821928	Yeah.
5821928	5822869	Uh, Conan the Pal.
5825773	5830855	Yeah, Rastan the Berserker, there we go.
5830855	5832216	Oh no, he's a thief.
5832216	5845961	But there you go, and it also has high score leaderboards and different difficulties, and you can reproduce the arcade settings and all kinds of stuff.
5845961	5847462	So, there you go.
5849605	5853530	Well, let's talk about some games coming to PlayStation Plus.
5853530	5858216	So if you are a PlayStation Plus person, then you know you get some free monthly games.
5858216	5861360	And the monthly games that will be going up on May 7 have been announced.
5861360	5864985	This is also your reminder to grab the current library of games from April.
5865485	5868187	Destiny 2 Lightfall PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 EA Sports FC 24 Standard Edition
5893680	5897722	PlayStation Plus, Ghostrunner 2 on the PlayStation 5.
5897722	5905485	And then the Mike Deft endorsed game Tunic also will be given away for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
5905485	5911087	So you are literally like now I think that game has been given away on Xbox or at least with Game Pass.
5911087	5913508	Now it's been given away as part of this.
5913508	5915768	I don't think they've given it away on Nintendo's platform.
5915768	5921951	But Mike Deft would like to let you know you literally have no reason at this point to not try Tunic.
5923156	5924177	And I did, I did play Tunic.
5924177	5925918	I should finish Tunic, really, but I played it.
5925918	5926459	It was cute.
5926459	5927900	I liked it.
5927900	5930802	It was a neat little spin on a familiar formula.
5930802	5932663	So I liked it.
5932663	5933964	All right.
5933964	5942590	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you can buy this week because they're probably not going to be free this week, but you can buy them because they're coming out.
5942590	5944912	Loki, what do you have for the US?
5944912	5948915	We have Indica on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5949591	5965817	The Rising on PC, Animal Well on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5, Gift on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Crow Country on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5965817	5968579	We can't stop here.
5968579	5970019	This is Crow Country.
5970019	5971780	Exactly.
5971780	5976842	Little Kitty, Big City on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5978527	5988073	Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle Chomp Champs on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5988073	5992215	I feel like Namco could have shortened that name a lot.
5992215	6000920	And then, last but not least, a familiar one, Rainbow Cotton on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One.
6002323	6005964	Rob, you came over and played that game with me.
6005964	6008125	I thought you did when I had it on Dreamcast.
6008125	6010066	I think it was a long time ago, but yeah.
6010066	6015888	I mean, I had had my DDR second around that time.
6015888	6020170	I'm almost positive when we did the show at your house some time ago, that definitely happened.
6021789	6023530	Alright, that game is trippy.
6052049	6052970	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
6078735	6079776	There's some stuff.
6079776	6080236	No one cares.
6080236	6081437	I'm kidding.
6081437	6088741	We have on the 10th for Switch, we have Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin.
6088741	6093624	Also PlayStation and Xbox Construction Simulator Gold Edition.
6093624	6097967	For computers, we have Homeworld 3 Collector's Edition.
6097967	6100549	For PlayStation, Jack Holmes Master of Puppets.
6101630	6105595	I would prefer Metallica's Master of Puppets, just saying.
6105595	6107898	Because that's freaking creepy looking.
6107898	6111303	On Switch and PlayStation, Withering Rooms.
6111303	6115208	And on the three major consoles, Sea of Stars.
6115208	6117050	And that is it, all on the 10th.
6118564	6123086	All right, just a few more stories, then we'll be inviting your comments, calls, emails and all that good stuff.
6123086	6127708	If you want to email us participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send us an email.
6127708	6132009	And if you want to give us a call that is all done through our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6132009	6134470	If you join the green room, we'll be taking calls in a little bit.
6134470	6140593	But we still have a few more stories for you, including kind of an I hate to bury the lead because this is another pretty big headline.
6140593	6143954	But we've considering it's a random week in May of sorts.
6143954	6145615	We've had a lot of big news this week.
6145615	6148096	And this is a very interesting follow up, huh, Loki?
6149417	6153940	Yeah, so apparently Nintendo is not done with litigious stuff.
6153940	6157942	It's just another week and more lawsuits and takedowns.
6157942	6165647	So now they've initiated a mass takedown of backups and clones of Yuzu, of course, on GitHub.
6165647	6172912	So over 8,000 repositories removed and they're trying to stop them from forking it.
6172912	6177735	And then, of course, there's been some
6179008	6188375	They've removed reference mirrors and files of various Yuzu versions, as well as Pineapple and other Switch emulator based off the Yuzu code.
6188375	6195660	The, apparently, repositories they say offer provided access to Yuzu emulator or code based on Yuzu emulator.
6195660	6199903	The Yuzu emulator is primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games.
6199903	6207348	Specifically, Yuzu illegally circumvents Nintendo's technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games.
6208390	6212959	GitHub has processed takedowns of the entire network of 8,535 repositories.
6220816	6223917	Well, if it's the internet that way, that is not going to stop it.
6223917	6227237	That emulator really got forked by Nintendo's legal team this week, didn't it?
6227237	6231678	I mean, yeah, but it just means they'll just push it underground.
6231678	6232478	Ding, ding, ding.
6232478	6233659	That's all this is going to do.
6233659	6236199	It's just going to... So what have we learned this week?
6236199	6241240	You're not going to be able to have it on GitHub because Nintendo has their very litigious eye on GitHub.
6241240	6242981	They do not like this emulator.
6242981	6248742	They do not like the fact that it plays current, you know, a current system that, you know, they're still selling in stores and all of this.
6249082	6250843	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6264290	6264390	Steve
6287429	6290613	where people are at work and it's a lot less visible.
6290613	6300265	Now I'm sure if Nintendo, I'm sure Nintendo is not above doing a cease and desist to different discords and you know, but they'd have to find- I would say it's even, not even discords, it's gonna be forums.
6300265	6303890	There's gonna be forums that this is, you know, rampant in.
6304190	6325114	or fucking people are still on IRC and shit like it's yeah, there's IRC channels, you know, probably where people type of the more old school stuff that's a little it's not quite as out there and easy to find with a search because you know, I get hub they probably well, you know, it's public what's forked from what and then you know, searching for emulators that they probably found a bunch of them.
6325114	6332896	So yeah, it's just it's gonna it's gonna make this harder for people to do but it's not gonna stop it.
6332896	6333096	So
6334502	6335623	Yeah.
6335623	6346551	But, you know, if you are doing emulators for the Nintendo Switch, it really should be for, you know, homebrew stuff and not to not to steal games, you know, not to play games for free.
6346551	6359762	But it is I do think there's something particularly fascinating about how having the Switch emulator on your computer can run some games better than they look on a Switch is interesting.
6361055	6365376	Yeah, you know, I wouldn't play anything I don't already own, but it's interesting.
6365376	6367076	That's all.
6367076	6368316	All right.
6368316	6369516	Moving on.
6369516	6373497	Let's talk about for the switch to some more rumors.
6373497	6376258	But this this one we're going to file under duh.
6376258	6379798	And of course, but we'll we'll talk about it anyway.
6379798	6385939	Apparently a leaker that has been correct before and will probably be correct again.
6385939	6389860	Midori has leaked things out of Sega and Atlas before.
6390340	6392421	Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi
6415652	6443665	but we haven't heard anything about platforms but it does appear according to Midori every Atlas and Sega remake is releasing on Switch 2 now it doesn't to me it doesn't mean it's limited to Switch 2 and I just don't see Sega doing that but I bet you know if Nintendo is let's say they do plan on announcing the Switch 2 in June I'm still skeptical that that's happening but I see I see a possibility where they're not gonna do it
6444566	6446267	I don't think I don't think they do either.
6446267	6448629	But I see a pathway.
6448629	6452333	I was really bent on that fucking console isn't coming out this year.
6452333	6459780	But now with some of the recent leaks and things I'm like, I maybe like I but it's Yeah, I still would bet on next year.
6459780	6459880	Oh,
6461247	6466435	If they were to announce, well whenever they announce the Switch 2, fine, they do it January, February next year.
6466435	6472184	Whenever they announce it, these Sega partnerships would be some great things to put in there.
6472184	6475649	Imagine the sizzle reel they could have coming to Nintendo Switch 2.
6476550	6479153	CrazyTaxi, GoldenAxe, Jetset Radio
6496912	6502533	you know, Sega seems to work a lot with Nintendo these which is so weird, obviously, right?
6502533	6510395	All of us that existed in the 80s and early 90s gaming scene sit here and go Sega, Nintendo being pals is so weird, but it's a different world now.
6510395	6511736	Lots changed, right?
6511736	6516897	So I get I feel like Sega gets a lot of announcements and Nintendo stuff.
6516897	6518137	I could see that happening.
6518137	6520398	So it's just a matter of time.
6522130	6527082	Alright, well for our last scheduled story tonight, unfortunately, a little bit of sad news here at the end.
6527082	6527563	DarkSakura.
6528800	6533742	Yeah, I was pretty floored when I saw this.
6533742	6542385	But and and DBD fans are definitely, you know, going to be on this.
6542385	6553268	Zoe Alexandria, who is the voice actor for The Unknown, was dealing with a pretty awful
6555149	6563255	autoimmune illness and actually died on April 30th.
6563255	6575243	And there were some posts that were made, one from the fourth that said that she had permanently decided to stop treatment for her illness, that the
6576244	6588628	There was no quality of life on the medication and that, you know, she was having seizures and stiff person attacks and was ready just to live as it is.
6588628	6601252	She was dealing with, I'm going to mispronounce this, non-paraneoplastic limbic autoimmune encephalitis and stiff person syndrome.
6602692	6611876	And it's pretty, any form of encephalitis has to do with swelling on the brain and this was caused by an immune response.
6611876	6617079	So it's pretty vicious.
6617079	6624062	And so the last three posts, one on the
6625928	6633216	The 23rd was, sometimes things don't go as planned, and no matter how hard you try to make things work, sometimes God has something else in store.
6633216	6638341	Sometimes surrendering is the best course of action.
6638341	6643347	And then she finally passed on April 30th, so...
6646654	6648715	And she was only 29, right?
6648715	6649875	Yeah, she was born in 94.
6649875	6650935	Horrible.
6650935	6652975	That's so sad.
6652975	6657296	And she had been receiving such bullshit from people just because she's trans.
6657296	6671419	Well, and I was going to say, like, you might remember, like, even if you don't play DBD, she was in the news just like two months ago when this first came out, because she kind of had some things to say about it, but then was like, people are taking me out of context, never mind, type of thing.
6671419	6674380	Like, I remember there was kind of like that that letter that she had posted.
6674380	6675020	Then she was like,
6675700	6679246	people are are reading into this the way I don't want them to read into it.
6679246	6680428	Nevermind type of thing.
6680428	6683312	And she would kind of wanted to work with behavior behind the scenes on her issues.
6683312	6686578	And it had to do with some of the costumes and things I think that they were selling.
6686578	6689683	But yeah, and then of course, she was, unfortunately,
6691567	6694508	Trans people get a lot of bullshit online and it sucks.
6694508	6699970	And, you know, Twitter, unfortunately, is a platform that empowers this stuff.
6699970	6708553	When you have the owner of, although, didn't the owner of Twitter respond to JK Rowling saying, maybe you should post about something else.
6708553	6716256	I saw, I saw a screenshot of that make its way over to the other site that like, like, like, no, he was like, I agree with you, which sucks.
6716256	6717516	Her opinion sucks.
6717516	6718797	But even, even he's like,
6720027	6724049	you need a new thing to talk about her anti trans rhetoric.
6724049	6738454	But the reason why I bring that up is that like, you know, unfortunately, trans individuals are facing this bullshit every day on social media, because certain people with a platform, like that woman that wrote the wizard book, empower it.
6738454	6740435	It sucks.
6740435	6748378	And when that happens, people feel empowered to echo it and you know, say it to the faces of people impacted by it anyway.
6750958	6755340	No, it's terrible.
6755340	6763105	But I'm such a short life and dealing with such bullshit, but doing it with grace.
6763105	6771550	I, I hope, well, she seemed to me pretty, pretty hardcore Christian.
6771550	6774772	And well, I hope her faith saw her through her end.
6776291	6776651	Skullmom
6797402	6797462	I'm
6812876	6818979	She's, you know, has has this art that she'll forever be memorialized in, which is is nice.
6818979	6821380	But yeah, just just terrible.
6821380	6824262	I hope maybe I almost said Blizzard.
6824262	6824482	Sorry.
6824482	6835688	I hope Behavior will consider maybe doing a fundraiser to raise awareness of this syndrome and, you know, possibly like maybe a charity skin for the unknown to maybe raise money for.
6835688	6840590	There's there's a call out right now to do a charm like they did for Puppers.
6840590	6841971	Oh, yeah, that would be nice, too.
6841971	6842211	Yeah.
6843171	6847313	Thank you for watching!
6855575	6856635	All right.
6856635	6861678	Well, if you have some things you'd like to talk about, we'd like to invite you to participate with the listener roundtable.
6861678	6874704	Every week we invite your phone calls, your emails and other comments and questions and chat if maybe we didn't get around to something you wanted to talk about tonight over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we tape live on Sunday nights.
6874704	6877465	I think I saw one email sneak in there.
6877465	6878005	This one.
6878005	6878565	There's one.
6878565	6879866	DarkSakura, let's get to the email tonight.
6881109	6884190	Alright, as soon as it opens.
6884190	6886691	Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi here.
6886691	6889812	I just wanted to say I appreciate listening to the show so much.
6889812	6891653	I wanted to give a shoutout to DarkSakura.
6891653	6892393	To me?
6892393	6894194	Why?
6894194	6896595	I recently picked up a game... Yeah, why?
6896595	6897095	Just kidding.
6897095	6897395	I'm kidding.
6897395	6899556	Just talked about called Demon's Tilt.
6899556	6900396	I'm ignoring Rob.
6903554	6906555	And I never really understood why y'all like pinball so much.
6906555	6911177	So in my quest to try something new, I thought I'd pick up the game on Switch and see what I thought of it.
6911177	6916279	Well, I can safely say DS knows what she's talking about with the classic Game of the Week segment.
6916279	6918440	Thanks so much for all that you guys do.
6918440	6919920	I'm really enjoying the game.
6919920	6920420	Love y'all.
6920420	6921221	Stay awesome.
6921221	6922941	Sincerely, Mishi.
6922941	6925142	Aww, thank you.
6925142	6926563	Look at that, DarkSakura.
6926563	6929784	Proof that you're educating the children out there.
6929784	6930264	So.
6930264	6931385	I am.
6931385	6931785	I mean, and
6934167	6942609	Like the Demon's Tilt is like such a love letter to like Devil's Crush and Alien Crush and Jackie Crush.
6942609	6946890	So it's it's perfect.
6946890	6948850	I love it.
6948850	6949310	All right.
6949310	6950571	Those are the best emails.
6950571	6953411	The one the one to just tell us how great we are.
6953411	6954491	We love those emails.
6954491	6957792	It's always a feel good feeling going into a Monday.
6957792	6960153	I still have no regrets getting Mishi into Avatar.
6962614	6965738	All right, again, participate at Orange Lounge Radio.
6965738	6970925	If you'd like to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email.
6970925	6972748	It's dot com.
6972748	6974410	It's dot com.
6974410	6975692	Let's see.
6975692	6977334	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
6977594	6981576	HellDivers 2 is no longer supported by the Playstation Network, but the dev team is encouraging
7000615	7009805	to write those negative reviews because it's helping them get extra ammo for fighting against Sony about this.
7009805	7016232	Because this is Sony's decision, not Team Arrowhead or whatever the Arrowhead Studios was that put that together.
7018416	7023660	Yeah, so they said essentially players making their displeasures known through reviews, refunds, etc.
7023660	7026062	gives us more pull in the discussions with Sony.
7026062	7027603	They don't read our Discord.
7027603	7028343	Oh, does it?
7028343	7036109	To see the game's popularity suffer in ratings, but discussions are ongoing and our team is on the side of the players in this fight.
7036109	7042634	It's unrealistic to expect players to make PSN accounts in different regions to get past the account linking requirement.
7042634	7043494	We are aware of that.
7043494	7045416	Discussions are ongoing.
7045416	7046357	So in this case,
7047447	7048148	Rated Down.
7063956	7066237	going against the publisher.
7066237	7069078	How often does that happen in games?
7069078	7070659	That's kind of wild to me.
7070659	7073481	And I think we all kind of know like Arrowhead.
7073481	7075201	That might be in their Discord, though.
7075201	7078503	I think it might be in the Discord because this looks like a Discord screenshot.
7078503	7081705	But still, you know, you know, when you say something there, it's going.
7081705	7084286	And if you don't know that, you fucking better learn.
7084286	7088088	If you're a developer, that is really wild.
7089428	7100510	SSJ100 Matt says, I just saw a video that someone cut up, Yakko's Nations of the World, but it's just countries that can't play Helldiver 2.
7100510	7105471	It's not funny, but leave it to the internet to fucking... It's gallows humor.
7105471	7107412	Yeah, yes, gallows humor.
7107412	7110973	Yeah, just to fucking meme it up.
7110973	7112153	All right, hold on, hold on.
7113391	7116634	SSJ100 Matt dropped the link and I'm sorry.
7116634	7118516	You know, I've got you know, I've got to do this.
7118516	7119257	I've got I'm sorry.
7119257	7129247	I'm sorry to Jamaica, Republic, Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Guyana, Belize, Bermuda, Bahamas, Tobago, Suriname, French Guiana, Barbados and Guam.
7131926	7137751	Delbania, Iraq and Iran, there's Syria, Jordan, Bogdanoz, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan, Bangladesh, Mongolia.
7156175	7162677	But yeah, and I agree record WN put it quite succinctly in chat saying GG Arrowhead.
7162677	7165058	Yeah, I big agree on that.
7165058	7168880	This is this is going to be fascinating to see develop.
7168880	7172921	I'm very curious what this whole situation is going to look like in seven more days.
7172921	7180184	Yeah, if if Sony ends up having to succumb to this pressure by the developer.
7180184	7181244	Very, very interesting.
7181244	7183145	So we'll see how it develops in the next seven days.
7186566	7188807	They also had, what was it?
7188807	7194631	The CEO of Arrowhead, though, made a comment today saying that, I do have my part to play.
7194631	7196052	I'm not blameless in all of this.
7196052	7200654	It was my decision to disable account linking at launch so players could play the game.
7200654	7206478	I did not ensure players were aware of the requirements and we didn't talk about it enough.
7206478	7208359	We knew this was about six months before launch.
7208359	7212241	It would be mandatory for online PS titles.
7214025	7217748	So, yeah.
7217748	7226233	Um, comment from chat, DarkTutsuya, following up on, did I convince myself that this was a thing?
7226233	7233518	DarkTutsuya says, there was a Super Nintendo version of sorts of Nintendo World Championship called PowerFest.
7233518	7234439	It had a different name.
7234439	7235580	That's what it was.
7235580	7236861	Super Mario Bros.
7236861	7238282	2 Lost Levels.
7238282	7239543	Ken Griffey Jr.
7239503	7241124	's Home Run Derby Mode.
7241124	7241144	I
7242256	7245638	I totally forgot that Ken Griffey Jr.
7245638	7246479	was a thing.
7246479	7252862	Well, I mean, I remember that he was a person, but I forgot that that was a game until you said that just now.
7252862	7254463	Now I remember the game.
7254463	7257485	And a lap in Super Mario Kart was the PowerFS cartridge.
7258886	7267273	And Bobby Blackwolf again with the very macabre humor in chat saying, incoming closure of Arrowhead Studios.
7267273	7276880	Quote, due to the issues from their latest title and the losses therein, we have made the difficult decision to close Arrowhead Studios in order to compensate.
7276880	7282485	That's that's some very dark humor.
7282485	7282785	All right.
7285506	7286767	I guess that's it.
7286767	7288267	We got no more emails.
7288267	7290128	We got no calls.
7290128	7290888	No.
7290888	7292229	No, you want to do something?
7292229	7292969	What?
7292969	7294110	No, we have nothing.
7294110	7295651	No, we ain't found shit.
7295651	7296491	All right.
7296491	7299212	Well, then on that note, we're gonna wrap it up for tonight.
7299212	7301673	But we'll be back in seven days.
7301673	7304235	And this news could be developing quickly on the Helldivers front.
7304235	7305095	And of course, other things.
7305095	7308337	This ended up being a pretty busy Newsweek, all things considered.
7308337	7310738	So yeah, we'll be back in seven days.
7310738	7311318	In the meantime,
7312078	7315421	As always, if you enjoyed listening to Orange Sans Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
7315421	7319825	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7319825	7327412	So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show, goes an awful long way.
7327412	7329693	So we appreciate all of that.
7329693	7331755	Let's get around to final thoughts.
7331755	7335819	And DarkSakura, I know you're going to be streaming some tonight after the show.
7335819	7337240	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
7340140	7347365	Sometimes you need to slow down and just appreciate what's around you.
7347365	7348706	Just slow down.
7348706	7350968	Just for once, just slow down.
7350968	7351608	That's all.
7351608	7353670	You can't tell Sonic to slow down.
7353670	7355051	I'm not telling Sonic to slow down.
7355051	7356792	Sonic is irrelevant.
7356792	7357773	OK, that's fine.
7357773	7358753	Irrelevant!
7358753	7359874	All right.
7359874	7361015	All right, DarkSakura, have a good stream.
7361015	7362276	We'll see you later.
7362276	7362836	Thank you.
7362836	7364458	Bye.
7364458	7365598	Then Loki, that means we go to you.
7365598	7366359	Your final thought tonight.
7369642	7372365	Loki?
7372365	7374487	I think Loki is frozen.
7374487	7376048	Well, this is awkward.
7376048	7377990	Loki's frozen.
7377990	7379772	So apparently I'm sitting here by myself.
7379772	7381153	That's all right.
7381153	7383275	So if Loki can hear me just know I can't hear you.
7383275	7385818	Okay, I think it's rebooting.
7385818	7388660	I think his camera may have kicked on and off.
7388660	7391023	Oh, now I see an angry looking Loki has come back.
7393939	7403121	Yeah, yeah, it freeze framed at just the appropriate moment where Loki looked really deep in thought, but Loki is back and looks like he's stewing at the controls there.
7403121	7405361	Loki, can you hear me?
7405361	7407082	I think my audio cut out.
7407082	7408262	My mixer is something.
7408262	7408742	I can't hear you.
7408742	7409302	It sure did.
7409302	7411843	You, you, you went to hell.
7411843	7414223	Can you hear me now?
7414223	7417064	Do you hear the words that are coming out of my mouth?
7417064	7419044	Okay.
7419044	7421985	Final, can somebody, can we sign to Loki?
7421985	7423025	Give your final thought.
7424261	7426602	Final thoughts.
7426602	7427303	Read my lips.
7427303	7431525	Final thought, Loki.
7431525	7436187	Loki's final thought is tech problems are unavoidable.
7436187	7443251	Uh, all right.
7443251	7445012	My final thought is this.
7445012	7446893	Oh, it's got to work again.
7446893	7447794	It glitched out there.
7447794	7448894	It was weird.
7448894	7449255	Yeah.
7449255	7450015	Strong finish.
7450015	7450315	Thanks.
7450315	7450976	Yeah.
7450976	7451616	All right, Loki.
7451616	7453237	Now that we've got you back, your final thought, please.
7454195	7455336	Yeah, I don't know what was up with that.
7455336	7464242	Like everything like my USB hub just shut off and turn back on again, which is great for brand new USB hub I just purchased to have that happen.
7464242	7466503	Love to see it.
7466503	7467584	That's your final thought?
7467584	7469045	Okay, love to see it.
7469045	7470226	All right.
7470226	7477030	My final thought is, if it ain't broken, is it really Orange Lounge Radio?
7477030	7480052	On that thought, have a wonderful week, everybody.
7480052	7481153	We'll see you in seven days.
7481153	7482634	Happy gaming and all that stuff.
7482634	7482934	Bye.
7485273	7489834	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
