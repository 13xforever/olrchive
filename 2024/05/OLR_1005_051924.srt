1
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:18,970
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not often that a game is substantially broken twice, first with its initial release and ongoing slate of bug fixing updates, as well as any additional content created for it, then a significant overhaul that comes nine years later.

2
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,514
[SPEAKER_03]: After a product is released, modders take action into their own hands and tweak details for memes, playability, opinions, trolling, and more.

3
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:28,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not common that a later release comes that creates massive swaths of fallout in this community.

4
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,239
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Nuclear Blast Headline.

5
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

6
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:37,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:42,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

8
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:46,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1005 of our program for tonight.

10
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:58,437
[SPEAKER_05]: May 19, 2024.

11
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:08,044
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts here with you week after week after week after week after week with my co-hosts, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:20,694
[SPEAKER_05]: She may actually join us a little later in the show, but you may have heard her mentioning last week on the show or last couple weeks, really, that she had a big pinball expo down in Lodi, the Golden State Pinball Expo that she was going to be doing.

13
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:24,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know on her social, she's been talking about contributing on some of the pinball

14
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:28,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Podcasts and broadcasts and productions coming out of that.

15
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think her presence tonight will just depend on when that all wraps up.

16
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:36,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And when she gets home, if she can join us towards the end, she will give us a report from the show.

17
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:42,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But if not, actually, I just literally as I'm talking, I don't know if she's listening, but I just got a text.

18
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still at camp so likely won't be home.

19
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:44,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

20
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:45,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's that.

21
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we're not going to get joined by DarkSakura tonight.

22
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:49,109
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will talk to her

23
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:49,709
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

24
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing pretty good.

25
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:20,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

26
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Any pinball in your weekend?

27
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,015
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

28
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:24,435
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

29
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,475
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

30
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:29,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we'll see if there was Minecraft or maybe something outside Minecraft.

31
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:30,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that with your gaming week.

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,518
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be both of those things.

33
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, maybe a little bit.

34
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:37,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, I think we'll get right into our kickoff topic for tonight.

35
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get into it.

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's going on in the gaming world this week?

37
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get dangerous.

38
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: That's PlayStation five sales.

39
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:50,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So the of course, articles been out saying, hey, you know what?

40
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:54,209
[SPEAKER_04]: They've fallen short of the PlayStation four records.

41
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:00,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Even apparently only half as many PlayStation four owners have a PlayStation five.

42
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:05,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I'm one of those people that doesn't have a PlayStation five.

43
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:13,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now they've reached almost 60 million lifetime sales.

44
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:19,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know, six or I'm sorry, 60 million is in what the PlayStation 4 achieved.

45
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,714
[SPEAKER_04]: They've was a 59.2 million, essentially the same, you know.

46
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:36,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, they said that as we enter the second half of the console cycle, we expect the number of new PlayStation five units to gradually decline, which, yeah, makes sense because people already have them.

47
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:41,114
[SPEAKER_04]: They will probably wait for the next console if that's the case.

48
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:47,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in my case, just play things as they come out on PC because everything's here.

49
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So why not?

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for Final Fantasy, you know, 16.

51
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,023
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's not here yet.

52
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:56,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet, but we know it's coming.

53
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it will be coming at some point.

54
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:03,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We always kind of knew it was gonna hit PC even though they were being a little bit coy about it in the beginning.

55
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of knew it was coming.

56
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,030
[SPEAKER_05]: So

57
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:19,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so along with that, of course, funny that we're even hearing about this now, but apparently there's now new ways to jailbreak your PlayStation 4 using a TV because that's fun.

58
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be web pages.

59
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's TVs.

60
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:25,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty sweet.

61
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new LG TVs if you run those.

62
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:35,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny enough, I just got an LG TV, so I don't think I'll be jailbreaking my PlayStation 4 because I don't play my PlayStation 4.

63
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Jailbreak your PS4 to do what?

64
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Like play, uh, backups.

65
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can do what you can do, what you can play backups.

66
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So the legal things you could do with it.

67
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, isn't it already region free?

68
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:46,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

69
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

70
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,088
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S

71
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:12,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Or loading custom homebrew software, like emulators and that type of thing.

72
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:16,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your emulator device with your PlayStation 4.

73
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:23,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the kind of legal-ish stuff that you would do with it, aside from stealing things.

74
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's it's hard.

75
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do that.

76
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is very interesting, though.

77
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:38,150
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole fact about the PlayStation five sales slowing way down is is a little bit shocking in a way.

78
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not shocking, I don't think, actually.

79
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:45,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And you kind of yeah, you put the needle on it when you said you yourself have not.

80
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:48,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've been doing a game podcast for 20 years.

81
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:51,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't feel the obligation to get a PS5 because you're going to get those games somewhere else.

82
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:59,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not even that like it's like I bought a an Xbox Series X in like in previous console generations.

83
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:02,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's usually been that I pick one or the other.

84
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:10,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 actually had both had all all of the systems in the following generation.

85
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:16,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a PlayStation 4 because I kind of looked at it like, OK, the games I want to play are going to be on PlayStation.

86
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:18,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I was looking forward to that.

87
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like PlayStation VR, obviously,

88
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,952
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

89
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the games that are coming out on it.

90
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was looking forward to like those Microsoft Purchase Studios, so like the Bethesda exclusive games and stuff like that.

91
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:50,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanted to play on a Series X. That said, I have like hardly gamed on that Series X. It is in a box below my desk right now.

92
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,755
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

93
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I play everything on a PC now for the most part.

94
00:06:55,797 --> 00:07:02,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's kind of now that more games are coming out from Sony on PC.

95
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, why would I spend $500 on a console that plays a handful of games that I can't get right now on PC?

96
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's not really a use case for it.

97
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:20,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could say, oh, PlayStation VR 2, but then you have to drop another $500 for that too.

98
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, I don't want to do that.

99
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,104
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's

100
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:34,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Just not something I see myself doing and even like next console generation, aside from Nintendo, Nintendo gets purchased every time like that is just its own thing.

101
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:38,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Next generation, I might not even get a console, it may be just

102
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,734
[SPEAKER_04]: play what's on PC, you know, depending on what's coming out.

103
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:48,360
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to really like sell me on why I need a console.

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think a lot of like, especially when it comes to Microsoft, I don't think they really care if I have a console.

105
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:56,150
[SPEAKER_04]: They just like, yeah, it's player games.

106
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,971
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we'll put them on PC.

107
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:06,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna go to our chat, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

108
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate all those follows over on our Twitch channel, where we broadcast right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

109
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:13,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby is in chat saying,

110
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So many games still release on PlayStation 4.

111
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:23,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, DJ Ranma S kind of following up that comment saying, I mean about half of the PlayStation 5 games are PS4 ports.

112
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more than that.

113
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:29,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, there was no reason to buy one until Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth dropped.

114
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bought Final Fantasy 16, but I was just waiting.

115
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:42,450
[SPEAKER_05]: S2100Mad has an excellent point too, saying, I will say the PS5 not being readily available for 2 years after launch really kept me away from gaming.

116
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I wholeheartedly agree with that.

117
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:50,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that whole thing where a movie makes its best box office opening weekend, a game sells

118
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:59,522
[SPEAKER_05]: usually, and I should say usually because there are strange cases like, you know, when Titanic came out, I don't think it actually made its most money the first weekend.

119
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:00,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's always exceptions.

120
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:08,387
[SPEAKER_05]: But most blockbuster movies, most video games even make most of their money that first weekend, right?

121
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:12,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So PlayStation and limited hardware issues really botched that.

122
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously that continued for a very long time.

123
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think that sucked the air out of the room a little bit.

124
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:30,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's that domino effect into what Bobby and Rama just said, is that the reason why so many games were releasing on PlayStation 4, games take more than a year or two to develop.

125
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:34,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So PS4 was being targeted because for the longest time, people couldn't get PS5s.

126
00:09:35,513 --> 00:10:02,444
[SPEAKER_05]: and now it's it turned into this vicious vicious cycle kind of thing because now Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sales are down compared to Final Fantasy VII Remake well because it was limited to PlayStation 5 and just even to this day even though we're years into PlayStation 5 and we're past that point where you could walk into Target and get one uh it just hasn't sold as many units so I I kind of think yeah it was it was kind of doomed from the beginning because the way this hardware rolled out

127
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:09,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think that's in addition to something else that I think is worth talking about as well, because to me, it plays in a little bit too.

128
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:14,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember last week on the show, I was talking a little bit about all these layoffs and things that are going on in the industry.

129
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:18,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about, I really think we're looking at a video game crash.

130
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,502
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

131
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a good term for it.

132
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:39,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's definitely a cold crash, especially in like that AAA realm, right?

133
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:40,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe not the indie realm.

134
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:46,121
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always going to get carried by indies because that was something that didn't exist in the Atari 2600 era.

135
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:49,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, you can make Halo 2600 now, but you couldn't do that in 1983, 1984.

136
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:58,905
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it wasn't until the Commodore 64 and home computing let you make those games that ironically, that's also kind of when the industry was picking up again, that and the Nintendo and all that stuff.

137
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:26,068
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S calls it a video game recession, kinda, but it's weird because I think we had such, I think, I think Ranma what's happening is that because we had such an uptick because of COVID and lockdowns and all that, and then such a drop after that, that kind of went past the starting point in a way, I, that's why I kind of lean more towards the term crash, because it's almost like the roller coaster, it went up that hill, and now it's

138
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming way down.

139
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:34,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think some of that ties into this PlayStation 5 sales as well.

140
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:42,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a big part of that is that, again, Loki just illustrated a real incentive why people don't necessarily want to get PlayStation 5s.

141
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,304
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a computer that can play those games.

142
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, not everybody can afford a high-end computer.

143
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:51,890
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why consoles exist in the first place and why a console like Xbox Series S

144
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: has notably done pretty good because it's that happy medium of like affordability, but plays the current games, right?

145
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:00,995
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I digress.

146
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:12,481
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about PlayStation, why did PlayStation 2 really, why did PlayStation 2 really sell oodles and oodles of units?

147
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Final Fantasy 10?

148
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did PS3 sell oodles and oodles of units?

149
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:19,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a little bit, but once a winner was declared in a certain war

150
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,763
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 was one of the most affordable Blu-ray players at the time.

151
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:51,454
[SPEAKER_05]: but did it really have any features?

152
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:57,579
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would argue that the PlayStation 4 was still, in a way, a must-have media device.

153
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:08,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Ironic, because their main competitor in the same generation, the Xbox One, was hinging their entire platform on, do you remember?

154
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,988
[SPEAKER_05]: TV sports, TV sports, TV, TV sports.

155
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:11,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that?

156
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a passthrough.

157
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a passthrough HDMI that did picture-in-picture or something.

158
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:22,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas, essentially, PlayStation 4 was kind of doing the same thing.

159
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:24,215
[SPEAKER_05]: They just kept the focus on the games.

160
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:32,741
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, realistically, a lot of people were still buying PlayStation 4s because they served as media homes, right?

161
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And I even look at, like, my Xbox Series S or, excuse me, my Series X right now.

162
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:37,344
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it serving?

163
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much our media hub.

164
00:13:39,125 --> 00:14:05,468
[SPEAKER_05]: uh it's our it's on our downstairs hgtv and is our twitch machine our blu-ray machine all that stuff but i think a lot of people that's what playstation 4 is is that and and bobby points out ps4 launched with the camera and allowed for ar gaming on day one and ps4 was the first console you could natively stream from very easy i would say those are nice but i don't think they were as much as playstation 4 really selling itself as

165
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:10,538
[SPEAKER_05]: In part, the name brand recognition because everybody bought twos and threes.

166
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:15,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Lest we forget, the Xbox one also launched with a camera.

167
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,661
[SPEAKER_04]: and Connect.

168
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:18,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember it was bundled in.

169
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:19,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't get it.

170
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,002
[SPEAKER_05]: of the hardware change from PlayStation 3.

171
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:50,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Controversial, right?

172
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:53,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, there were so many games released on PlayStation 4 you couldn't get on PlayStation 3.

173
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony committed to that platform at that point.

174
00:14:55,787 --> 00:15:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, and here it is, SSJ100 Matt jumped to the punchline, but he's absolutely right.

175
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem with PlayStation 5.

176
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:05,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all your smart TVs already do.

177
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,936
[SPEAKER_05]: TV sports, TV, TV, TV sports, TV sports.

178
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:11,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So why should I get a PlayStation 5?

179
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,720
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that must-have thing

180
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:20,604
[SPEAKER_05]: on a PlayStation 5 that I can't get anywhere else.

181
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation games.

182
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:27,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm holding up a copy of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth because yes, I still have it sitting here.

183
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,869
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it.

184
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:36,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some other miscellaneous games that didn't release on PS4, but that's it's there's it's not as compelling.

185
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:39,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not nearly as compelling as the other systems that we went through.

186
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And considering that like, you know, PlayStation Now, I could see them eventually having that on smart TVs as well to stream, because that's certainly where xCloud wants to go if it's not already on some devices.

187
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be just smart for them to do that.

188
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,469
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is the PlayStation Now and xCloud are

189
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:07,514
[SPEAKER_04]: not the same at all, like equivalent wise for what you're getting for what you pay for.

190
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:11,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even close to being the same value, I feel.

191
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:12,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Garth the Wolf in chat.

192
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, good to see you, by the way, says the controller is neat.

193
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:16,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree.

194
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:18,284
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation five controller is pretty rad.

195
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:21,206
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is you could buy that controller separately.

196
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:25,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if that's really a problem, but it's a fact you could buy it separately.

197
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't even need the whole PlayStation.

198
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:31,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And that controller works really well on a PC or on your phone.

199
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:36,983
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have the the Delta emulator that just changed its logo because of an Adobe lawsuit.

200
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:44,011
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have that emulator, you can hook that up with a PS5 controller and you've got a pretty cool little classic gaming thing in your fucking pocket right now.

201
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the PlayStation 5 controller is neat, but technically it's not going to sell the system.

202
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I also like the Xbox Series controller, to be honest.

203
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:57,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think they have a good controller.

204
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's really just a matter of which one do you like more.

205
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:04,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of, it's kind of interesting.

206
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:11,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, it's interesting that PlayStation 5 has not created a compelling argument for why you need one necessarily.

207
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:22,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are some games, and I think for gamers, but again, I think for the mass audience that bought PlayStation 3s and 4s because they were cheap media devices and Blu-ray players, I don't think PlayStation 5 brought anything new to the table there.

208
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:30,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think Sony is going to need to leverage what it does with movies and entertainment when it comes to the PlayStation 6.

209
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:39,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So ironically, as much as we all made fun of TV sports, TV sports, TV, TV sports, I really think that's how they're going to sell PlayStation 6 when it comes to that.

210
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:39,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Although.

211
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:46,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting aside, interesting aside, Loki, you kind of glossed it over.

212
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:48,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's really important in what you said.

213
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:50,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You were kind of like, I don't buy consoles anymore.

214
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, but Nintendo, I mean, Nintendo doesn't really count.

215
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:55,065
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, Nintendo does their own thing.

216
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:00,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo counts.

217
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know Nintendo.

218
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:04,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is good at Nintendo, right?

219
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,934
[SPEAKER_05]: They very much are against the PC thing and all of that.

220
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:09,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Very much.

221
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,097
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're putting their games on PC, then maybe I'll stop buying the console.

222
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:16,761
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the portability is huge for them right now too.

223
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:21,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, you know, there's no question the Switch 2 is still a Switch.

224
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:29,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's no question, you know, especially in the fact that Nintendo has changed their hardware pretty significantly over the years.

225
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:30,673
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the jump from

226
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo to GameCube.

227
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,397
[SPEAKER_05]: GameCube to Wii.

228
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:41,721
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as we joke, as two GameCubes stuck together, we all know that the hardware cell in the controller was much bigger than that.

229
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:45,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Wii U was a hardware jump, for better or for worse.

230
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the Wii U to Switch.

231
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:50,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are really major pivots from system to system for Nintendo.

232
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:55,330
[SPEAKER_05]: much different than what we're talking about PlayStation in my opinion.

233
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think switch to switch to no fucking question.

234
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:07,404
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to keep the portability and the playing it on a TV because it's working really, really well for them.

235
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:08,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I just you're right.

236
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:15,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat just pointed out I completely skipped Nintendo 64.

237
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,460
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

238
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,280
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

239
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,481
[SPEAKER_05]: But okay, add it in.

240
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,602
[SPEAKER_05]: What else really changed?

241
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:28,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would say yeah, with the cartridge base, maybe and all that, but I would say those are still pretty heavy pivots even between, you know, adding that in there.

242
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:37,591
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the record, I didn't buy a Nintendo 64 until way late when I got a Pikachu N64 for 20 bucks.

243
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So that probably explains part of the Nintendo 64 erasure.

244
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one and then I threw it away.

245
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:43,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

246
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:46,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm an idiot.

247
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

248
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:51,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, for some reason, I was like, Oh, I'm never going to use this.

249
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, to be fair, I didn't.

250
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:55,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I can just play it on other things.

251
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:57,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.

252
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:57,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

253
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:05,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw in chat says yeah, I think Nintendo has that market down a portable system that dubs as a console they found their niche.

254
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:15,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, Nintendo has been dominating the handheld market ever since the fucking Game Boy really does any has anybody come close to Nintendo?

255
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:21,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the PSP maybe but I would say even then it was pretty far apart.

256
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the PSP did good but I guess not good enough for Sony to continue it.

257
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:27,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is why

258
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:30,004
[SPEAKER_05]: the Steam Deck.

259
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:30,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair.

260
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you that.

261
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:34,526
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's a little bit that's kind of a portable PC.

262
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

263
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll give you that.

264
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:37,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you that.

265
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:44,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what was I gonna say with the Oh, this is why you're hearing the rumors about Xbox and their next.

266
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They may be working on a portable thing because the next Xbox might be a portable console.

267
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Steam Decks, we'll see.

268
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:00,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange right in chat says iOS Android shouldn't count but it kind of does.

269
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:01,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem.

270
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:03,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's why it doesn't count.

271
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:09,658
[SPEAKER_05]: That that the in there's no official gaming controller for Apple or Android.

272
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:10,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can hook one up.

273
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they support.

274
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,320
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no official one.

275
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Many have

276
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no official one.

277
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:23,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And for that reason, all of the games still rely on the touch controls, which are horrible for most of your typical types of video games.

278
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:28,373
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, though, like PC doesn't have any official gaming controllers either.

279
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:32,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like Steam, which is nice, is pretty flexible with what it supports.

280
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:35,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like Android.

281
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:38,696
[SPEAKER_05]: In that sense, Windows 11 would disagree with you.

282
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, technically, I don't have to know about that.

283
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft makes a controller.

284
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I got I get what you're saying.

285
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:43,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

286
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:45,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm talking about Steam.

287
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:46,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Windows 11.

288
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:53,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I like my Xbox Series controller that I have right now.

289
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:56,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it works just fine.

290
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:57,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.

291
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:58,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, don't change it.

292
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have those fancy triggers, I guess, but.

293
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

294
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Next generation, they're all going to copy each other anyways.

295
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:10,347
[SPEAKER_05]: E3VL says no AAA exclusives on mobile.

296
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:13,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwell says what do you consider AAA exclusives because there are plenty of mobile-only games made by AAA studios.

297
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:50,490
[SPEAKER_05]: is like abandoning ship when it comes to like and isn't that interesting they tried to dip their water of putting i mean granted they wouldn't put their actual games but to give them some credit they were trying to make games that catered to the limited control i actually appreciate that nintendo did not try to put super mario brothers on a phone and that they did the run thing because it wouldn't have worked

298
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,011
[SPEAKER_05]: as well, you know, with the touchscreen and all that stuff.

299
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously those games did not take off.

300
00:22:56,832 --> 00:23:03,373
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have, you know, when I think of AAA mobile phone games, I don't think of things made by your traditional publishers.

301
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:09,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, Pokemon Go, but even that's the Pokemon companies in an agreement with Niantic for that.

302
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:16,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is really not involved in Pokemon Go, except for, you know, investment, I guess, if nothing else.

303
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:17,717
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know,

304
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:22,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But what, yes, but I would also say like, I actually wouldn't call pigment a triple A title.

305
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:38,635
[SPEAKER_05]: It's doing well, but it's not triple A. But I think you look at those games like Candy Crush, Clash of Kings, you know, the stuff that tends to top the charts that just, you know, and that they get what's, what's the one with Kathy Bates and all the ads murder mansion or whatever the over the top on those.

306
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:44,542
[SPEAKER_04]: None of those games are like, you know, accurate to their advertisements.

307
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:48,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But like Animal Crossing, like Pocket Camp, I mean, that's probably done well, I think.

308
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:53,413
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, I don't aren't they like sunsetting support or something for that?

309
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:55,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's doing as well as they thought.

310
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:59,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bobby is pointing out that Japan tends to do better.

311
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Kingdom Hearts spinoff stood all right on mobile.

312
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:05,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And Japan seems like a more hardcore mobile gaming culture in the US.

313
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:07,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And that that's, you know, there's been a lot of talk about that.

314
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And just with Japan being more transit culture and all of that.

315
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:17,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, yeah, Fortnite's a good well, obviously, there's been some issues with Apple versus Fortnite.

316
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:20,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's resolving at this point.

317
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So Fortnite will be a mobile title again, or a lot of people still have been playing it on mobile one way or another.

318
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:25,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

319
00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:26,357
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway,

320
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:37,104
[SPEAKER_05]: We're digressing a little bit from why aren't PlayStation fives selling but I do think ironically it's going to be you have to be able to cater them to more than just the gamer.

321
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:44,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be that family device something that convinces the non gamer in the household to want to want one too.

322
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:47,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that was true of the prior PlayStations.

323
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:52,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't different enough on PlayStation five because the PlayStation four still did everything.

324
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:53,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know that's just

325
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:54,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just cause...

326
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:24,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because they are operating under the assumption that they can have infinite growth and that just doesn't exist.

327
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Or that Battle Passes print money.

328
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:43,701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just... Or that they can argue for a $70 price point when they sell Battle Passes and cosmetics and all this other stuff that they tag on to it like we're idiots and go, Oh, well, no, games haven't gone up in price forever.

329
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:50,046
[SPEAKER_05]: because what happens in the boardroom is that people do, we did some market research.

330
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:59,012
[SPEAKER_05]: We did market research and here's what people are buying in Fortnite and the hottest games on the market is they're going to buy skins and they like to buy dances and games.

331
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:00,413
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to buy all this stuff.

332
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:12,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to put all these things because our market research has shown this is how Fortnite's making their money and gamers are going to buy it in our game too because they buy it in Fortnite and nobody along the way stops to ask the question,

333
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:20,653
[SPEAKER_05]: is this game good enough for people to want to spend that kind of extra money to invest in it and buy that extra crap?

334
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Nowhere along the way do people ask that question.

335
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:26,876
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to sell $70 game and monetize it like a mobile game that's free to play.

336
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:32,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which you can try to do that and sometimes be successful with it.

337
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But also you're gonna have part of your audience

338
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:37,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all

339
00:26:53,906 --> 00:27:11,294
[SPEAKER_04]: how many dozens of times have we seen games launch in such a broken state that it like it's just it can you imagine i mean we can't imagine because tesla but like can you imagine like a car being like released in this type of state where it's just

340
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:14,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, randomly it just swerves to the left.

341
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're cool with that.

342
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:24,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, sometimes it comes with three wheels and you're missing one, but you know, we'll eventually get you one so you can drive your car like it.

343
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like stupid stuff like that.

344
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Like.

345
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:28,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

346
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:33,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, clearly they know the state that the game is launching in, but they're just like, yeah, we're cool with that.

347
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put it out and we'll fix it later.

348
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:43,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's the problem is they want you to buy into these games that are quickly like they're rushing through them.

349
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:49,904
[SPEAKER_04]: They're forcing these studios to make these, you know, games that fleece the users to a ridiculous.

350
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:51,705
[SPEAKER_04]: They put all these mechanics in that just

351
00:27:52,245 --> 00:28:09,188
[SPEAKER_04]: are counterintuitive to good gameplay and a good gameplay design and loop and all that stuff and it's just it's just to in this to get more money and I mean like how many of these studios are talking about live service games like nobody on the like sure live service games make money but

352
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

353
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:29,016
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, less people are having kids these days.

354
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:32,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's because the live service games whole thing.

355
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:42,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, anyway, I want to point this out, though, because Quest Buster in chat says all of these massive triple A budgets are pushing aside everything else in their pipelines to focus on sure bets.

356
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I would argue there is no sure bet in gaming right now.

357
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because some things you would think are sure bets.

358
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:51,588
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not sure bets.

359
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:54,629
[SPEAKER_05]: The Avengers is on the line and would like to have a word.

360
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:58,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Suicide Squad is requesting a shout out right now.

361
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's it, Loki.

362
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:02,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamers fucking talk.

363
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:04,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're on fucking social media.

364
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:09,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is harder and harder to sell that stuff because people know this shit in advance.

365
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's happening with movies too.

366
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Madame Web is at the door and would like to say hello.

367
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:35,656
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's it I think because people are able to communicate a lot faster for better for worst word gets out quick that some of these games and some of these movies are fucking stingers and especially when Suicide Squad does this transparent battle pass shit for a game that is mediocre

368
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:49,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it's it's like even if an indie studio did that, like it would be called out the same way as far as like recycling content within your own game to pad it out.

369
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:58,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Like like Ubisoft just said that with their triple A or quadruple A game or whatever, Sea of Thieves or not Sea of Thieves.

370
00:29:58,554 --> 00:29:59,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember what it's called now.

371
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:00,335
[SPEAKER_04]: See, look at that.

372
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:02,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disappeared from my brain.

373
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember anymore.

374
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:06,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Sea of Thieves because Sea of Thieves is pretty good.

375
00:30:06,777 --> 00:30:09,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Sea of Thieves was not a quadruple A game either.

376
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:10,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not a quadruple A game.

377
00:30:10,618 --> 00:30:16,059
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, you know, their game is literally it made such an impression on me.

378
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember it now.

379
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:19,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally a couple of months after it came out.

380
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

381
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's it's I don't know what's going to end up happening.

382
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, you're going to have a lot.

383
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Record WN for the win.

384
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:31,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Skull and bones.

385
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Skull and bones.

386
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:32,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

387
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

388
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to forget it tomorrow anyways.

389
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:41,474
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 70 bones with an optional battle pass.

390
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:48,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like I don't we're going to see a lot of these studios, unfortunately, closed down because of this.

391
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:54,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping we'll get a lot more indie studios out of it that hopefully make some quality games.

392
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:58,524
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's like that's the thing with like indie game indie titles I played like this year.

393
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more excited about those than a lot of the AAA games that are coming out.

394
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:06,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I just want to say this before we get corrected.

395
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:15,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when people kind of go down this route, there are people very quick to shout, you can't just stop everything you're doing and start an indie studio be doing an indie studio doesn't pay your bills.

396
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,591
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a long term.

397
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:18,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I get that.

398
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:19,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

399
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:19,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sucks.

400
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:23,633
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that are falling out of the industry that aren't going to go back.

401
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That has to be acknowledged.

402
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:26,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sucks.

403
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:26,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

404
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:34,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But what, you know, people, people are going to move on to jobs that have the guaranteed income and that that sort of thing.

405
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:36,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And not everybody's going to be able to start in indie studio.

406
00:31:36,951 --> 00:31:38,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are going to have lost art.

407
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:39,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sucks.

408
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:47,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I love the happy ending when a group can get a new studio together and get that backing and financing and make a great product.

409
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:50,499
[SPEAKER_05]: But that unfortunately does tend to be the fairy tale ending.

410
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:53,650
[SPEAKER_04]: or make make smaller budget games.

411
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect example.

412
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a game playing behind me right now.

413
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it real quick.

414
00:31:58,053 --> 00:31:59,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

415
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:05,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I want more investors to invest in smaller indie studios.

416
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,557
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my wish.

417
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,078
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

418
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:09,879
[SPEAKER_04]: But not purchase them.

419
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:10,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

420
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So

421
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:16,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a game behind me right now called Animal Well that came out recently.

422
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:20,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the game size itself is very small.

423
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:26,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, pretty simple, like kind of 16 bit sprite graphics.

424
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:33,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like a really critically acclaimed game because you don't have to spend and I think it was made by like one dude.

425
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,035
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to spend

426
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:48,229
[SPEAKER_04]: a huge budget to make a game anymore like you don't have to do that that's the thing is like a lot of these students are spending like hundreds of millions like the Suicide Squad game they spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make this thing

427
00:32:49,503 --> 00:33:08,847
[SPEAKER_04]: where like where did they spend that money because i can't see anywhere that it went i mean i engine development maybe i don't know but like it's just it's certainly not in the assets that are this is probably a big big part of that which is why using ai to skip that step which is what's going to happen is very controversial

428
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:16,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so, you know, I think smaller scale games are OK.

429
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:17,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think it should do that.

430
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:24,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Helldivers, another good example of a game that smaller studio really popped off because it was a fun game.

431
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:26,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to build a good game.

432
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,594
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't build a game based off.

433
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:31,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to build a game based off of gameplay in the concept there.

434
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:37,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't build a game off of the monetization that you're going to put in it and then make a game around that.

435
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you just can't do that.

436
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:44,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course SSJ100 Matt says super multitasking and pixel poops number two also find examples.

437
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:44,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

438
00:33:45,754 --> 00:33:46,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

439
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:47,815
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

440
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: This is I mean, this this this is the industry in a nutshell right now.

441
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:52,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be very interesting.

442
00:33:52,878 --> 00:34:01,202
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we are a couple of weeks away from E3 Memorial Press Announcement Week, you know, in early because we know Microsoft's going to give us announcements.

443
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: We know Nintendo is going to give us announcements.

444
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a couple others that have confirmed as well for the E3 Memorial Week.

445
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:08,947
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no E3 this year.

446
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:09,287
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no E3.

447
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Sony didn't do the same week last year.

448
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:16,269
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't done the same week since the pandemic, and since they kind of dropped out of E3 either.

449
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:17,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So they may wait till August.

450
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:22,631
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, the E3 Memorial announcements are coming, Summer Game Fest, if you will.

451
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:28,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be it'll be interesting to see what is in gaming's future over the next few months.

452
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll continue to talk about it here on this show.

453
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, let's move on to some other topics.

454
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:33,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we got a lot to cover tonight.

455
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:36,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to also make sure we talk about our gaming weeks.

456
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So Loki, how was your gaming week?

457
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:43,274
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was playing Minecraft.

458
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:49,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft's 15th anniversary was on Friday, so it's 15 years old.

459
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:55,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was unrelated as just playing Minecraft.

460
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:59,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Working on actually forcing myself to work on the actual theme park.

461
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:04,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was designing the front gates for the theme park.

462
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:05,704
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming along pretty well.

463
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:16,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the meantime, I was recording a bit for this guy, BirdBoy, who is doing like a collab with them, sort of.

464
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It's making content for them, kind of.

465
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just working on that.

466
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:24,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, my mic settings are all messed up and I hate that.

467
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:32,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But then aside from that, I did play a ton of Turbo Kid.

468
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So still playing through that.

469
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty much at the end of the game.

470
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:53,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at the last boss battle, but I'm going through and trying to not 100% everything, because I don't know if you can easily, but I'm trying to like find all of the hidden things, the collectibles in the game right now, just going through some of that stuff.

471
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:56,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And then probably I'll just beat it and then move on to something else.

472
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:57,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Animal World.

473
00:35:57,065 --> 00:36:00,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played Animal World yet, but I want to.

474
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't want to start a second Metroidvania and, you know,

475
00:36:04,386 --> 00:36:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: during another Metroidvania, still want to play Fallout 4, which we'll get into that a little bit later.

476
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:14,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But but they keep updating it and it keeps breaking everything.

477
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucks.

478
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:20,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll eventually get around to that again.

479
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:27,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's working on trying to get an episode out probably this week because it's been two weeks already and get that ball rolling.

480
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:28,219
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

481
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,213
[SPEAKER_05]: My Game of the Week.

482
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:33,835
[SPEAKER_05]: God, y'all are gonna hate what a broken record I sound like because it's a lot of the same games.

483
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:39,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the wild thing is that there's a lot of new things going on in a lot of the games that I typically play.

484
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:50,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So Diablo 4, I've been playing this week, but a big new patch and a new season came out for Diablo 4, which is called the Season of Loot, I think, or Loot Unveiled or Loot Reborn or something like that.

485
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So Diablo 4 started its new season.

486
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:54,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a

487
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:55,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Deablo

488
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:18,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will absolutely back up what many people are saying and that is this is the best Diablo's been since it's launched.

489
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,471
[SPEAKER_05]: This is this is a great thing for the game to get a kick in the butt.

490
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you still haven't visited the game, I would I would encourage you to check it out because a lot of quality of life things, especially for leveling once you beat the story.

491
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:34,741
[SPEAKER_05]: You can now do what's called the Helltide from the very beginning of the game.

492
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:39,765
[SPEAKER_05]: You used to have to wait till you got to level 50 and get to world tier 3 before you could do what's called the Helltide.

493
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:41,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can do it from the beginning and they amped it up.

494
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:44,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the Helltides have way more monsters.

495
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,990
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a boss you can summon in there.

496
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,894
[SPEAKER_05]: They made it so that doing these things is kind of one of the best ways to level.

497
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And because you're doing that instead of going into instant dungeons,

498
00:37:54,957 --> 00:38:02,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you actually can feel like there are other people actually playing Diablo 4 because they're all out there also doing the Helltides with you.

499
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of feel like you're pretty often running into other players out there.

500
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:10,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So what they did with Diablo 4, absolutely great thing for the game.

501
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:11,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really into it.

502
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:16,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, and Questbuster in chat says it took nearly a year of waiting, but Necromancer is fun again.

503
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:19,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear Necromancer is really good and a great place.

504
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:21,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I am playing Sorcerer or Wizard.

505
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:26,511
[SPEAKER_05]: only because it's the one class in the game I don't have leveled up from a season yet.

506
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

507
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:28,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little slow to start.

508
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that I'm getting a lot of my abilities, it feels a lot better.

509
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:36,576
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Diablo 4 is a great place and I'd really encourage you to visit it if you haven't in a little bit.

510
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:36,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

511
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Other games I've been playing this week.

512
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,526
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've been doing Pokemon Go.

513
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:42,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I did Community Day today.

514
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:47,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I caught 18 shinies, 18 shiny bounce sweets today during Community Day.

515
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:49,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked like five and a quarter miles too.

516
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:52,232
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, I had to make, I had kind of a lazy week.

517
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:56,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to make up and get a big, big walk in today.

518
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did that.

519
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:02,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one other game I've been spending quite a bit of time with is an old favorite.

520
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:06,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Blast from the Past, World of Warcraft.

521
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, this is not World of Warcraft Classic Cataclysm, which I talked about last week.

522
00:39:11,303 --> 00:39:14,365
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a new thing that launched to World of Warcraft this last week.

523
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:19,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria Remix.

524
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:25,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not just World of Warcraft Classic Mists of Pandaria.

525
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:26,352
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not that.

526
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:31,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that's kind of what it was going to be, was a limited time like Pandaria Classic.

527
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:31,576
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

528
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:47,775
[SPEAKER_05]: It is full on modern wow, so it has every race class combo including the evokers and the dragon people and like the iron dwarves and all the stuff they've unleashed over the last few, the little fox people on horde.

529
00:39:48,376 --> 00:40:08,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Vulpera I think they're called all that stuff that they have unleashed or last few expansions you can play all of that the level cap is 70 like it is in regular WoW because they did a level smoosh some time ago if you weren't already aware so level cap is 70 dragon flight is a thing that you can do if you have the dragon you can use that embedded but you are limited to just Pandaria

530
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's no trade professions, there's no selling thing for gold, there's no auction house, so they've kind of stripped it down so it is just questing, dungeon running, raiding, and you can do these things very early on and you don't have to have the best type of gear to be able to do it.

531
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:35,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole thing kind of runs on with every quest that you turn in, you get a box of random loot.

532
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:40,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get random gems that do a fixes to things, which ironically feels a lot like Diablo.

533
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:46,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But for folks that did the plunder storm a couple months ago, it's a lot of stuff you saw in that you get random effects.

534
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:49,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have this cape that you're wearing.

535
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just randomly get stats added to your cape.

536
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:57,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So you suddenly become like super strong and you're just like rolling through things.

537
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

538
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:00,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really satisfying.

539
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:12,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a really smart thing that Blizzard did here because they found a really happy medium between nostalgic wow, for people that haven't played in a long time, like me,

540
00:41:13,443 --> 00:41:20,746
[SPEAKER_05]: and here's all the new modern WoW mechanics like Dragonflight, Talent Trees, Classes.

541
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:26,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's all the new modern WoW mechanics so you can get used to them before the next expansion.

542
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:33,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, when you finish Mists of Pandaria Remix and this whole thing closes down because only limited time is only like 90 days.

543
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:38,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Once it's done in 90 days, these characters will transfer to the regular realm.

544
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:41,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll have a character already ready to go for the next expansion.

545
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:50,397
[SPEAKER_05]: But you leveled it and did everything in more familiar content to those of you that haven't played WoW in a while.

546
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:54,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Very smart on Blizzard's part, as far as I'm concerned, and the Warcraft team.

547
00:41:54,779 --> 00:42:00,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a lot of fun and very satisfying to play, and it's helping me get used to what modern WoW really feels like.

548
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:04,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing a tanking monk because I really, I really like brewmaster monks.

549
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:11,024
[SPEAKER_05]: They are so much fun doing the beer splashing and then spitting fire on everybody is extremely satisfying.

550
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:31,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing this a little bit with my pal Shane, who sometimes comes on this show, and he brought up a really great point, is that not only do the characters transfer to the Forever Realm in the regular game, but all of the cosmetics you're earning, all of the transmog you're getting, all of that also will carry over into the main game.

551
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:39,394
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's almost like this is a way that you can get everything you missed in Pandaria and never have to play it again.

552
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:46,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if they're not going to do this for some of the other expansions later on to help people get caught up.

553
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:51,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's very, very, very interesting, but it's a it's a lot of fun.

554
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:55,536
[SPEAKER_05]: PodCulture in chat says Rob playing WoW, Return of Horde House confirmed.

555
00:42:55,536 --> 00:43:00,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if only the other guys were also playing WoW, which I think Grandpa might be.

556
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:03,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Grandpa's an Overwatch player now, believe it or not.

557
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:05,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Ekstafir also an Overwatch player.

558
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he plays a lot of WoW.

559
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane is playing WoW.

560
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:09,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

561
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,404
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very, very interesting.

562
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:16,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's it's been a little bit of a time sink for me, but a lot of fun.

563
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:19,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And Oh, what one other familiar game dead by daylight.

564
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:24,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we talked a lot about it on the show, but yet another limited time mode going on in that game.

565
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:32,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only did they have triple blood points this weekend, which is a nice reward, but they have what's called the chaos shuffle, which all of your perks are randomized.

566
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:38,622
[SPEAKER_05]: which sounds silly, but it's actually really fun because if you're playing survivor, then guess what?

567
00:43:38,622 --> 00:43:41,065
[SPEAKER_05]: The killer's perks are randomized too.

568
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:50,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't get people that are able to go in there with super sweaty builds that are, you know, tailored a certain way to like, you know, like people are kind of forced to play the game.

569
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:52,852
[SPEAKER_05]: as the game.

570
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:55,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's um, I know it sounds really weird, but it's true.

571
00:43:55,813 --> 00:44:02,234
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense if you play this game a lot, trust me, and you you run into some very interesting builds that are meant to troll a little bit.

572
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:04,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It forces people to play the game the way it's meant to be played.

573
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:08,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of people are actually really enjoying it.

574
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:09,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, one of them.

575
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:11,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my gaming week.

576
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:15,597
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of familiar stuff, but you know, good stuff, important stuff.

577
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:18,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to move on.

578
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:21,534
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to get into this next topic here.

579
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:28,258
[SPEAKER_05]: This is usually the part of the show where we kind of talk about housekeeping before we get into the actual news of the week.

580
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:36,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about things going on with the show and all of that good stuff, including I should mention here, again, we are not going to be here next week.

581
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:38,084
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be here in two weeks.

582
00:44:38,544 --> 00:44:44,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going out to Chicago to see friends, maybe play video games too, but I'll be back in two weeks.

583
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:50,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura will be here putting content out, and of course Bobby, I believe, is still live next week too.

584
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:52,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're doing a stream day on Saturday.

585
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:55,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, nice.

586
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bonds006, on that note with DVD, wait.

587
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,792
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to the other DVD announcements a little later on in the show, I promise.

588
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:10,073
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, on a serious note, though, I wanted to mention something else that's a little bit close to the show family and our hearts here.

589
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:11,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you want to kind of talk about this a little bit?

590
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:13,474
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

591
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:15,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I can talk about it.

592
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so Eddie from Starboard Power Coupling.

593
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been dealing with quite a bit of stuff recently dealing with cancer and trying to

594
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:39,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only battling stage 4 colon cancer, but taking care of his mom as well.

595
00:45:39,747 --> 00:45:51,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course he's run into a bit of a rough patch right now being out of work for so long, just trying to basically support himself to, you know,

596
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:57,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep a house, you know, a roof over his head and that type of stuff, you know, treatments and all that.

597
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So my wife and Irene have set up a co-fi or coffee.

598
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:10,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you old school OLR listeners will recognize a lot of these names.

599
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,961
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll recognize Princess Irene from back in the day.

600
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:14,403
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to host a show together.

601
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,525
[SPEAKER_05]: when this was on live 365.

602
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:20,749
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody remembers Outside the Box, that show is probably like 18 years old at this point.

603
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:22,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene and I host that show together.

604
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:27,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And Eddie was a guest on multiple of these shows.

605
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:30,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, most recently will be known to all of you from Starboard Power Coupling.

606
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:30,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

607
00:46:31,974 --> 00:46:42,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there's a coffee, I guess it's coffee is how you pronounce that, set up for, you know, the fundraising of that.

608
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you go to ko-fi.com, that's ko-fi.com slash we love Eddie, E-D-D-Y, you can go there and donate if you can to just help them out because, you know,

609
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:04,006
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really in a rough spot right now, so anything we can do to help him would be great.

610
00:47:15,198 --> 00:47:17,680
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

611
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:37,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, many of you every week are very good about, you know, giving bits, giving subs, and we really appreciate that.

612
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:45,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have those kind of pockets tonight, and you want to say thank you in a special way, this is a great way that you can do it.

613
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really appreciate it, you know, helping our friend Eddie through just

614
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,450
[SPEAKER_05]: a horrible, you know, fuck cancer.

615
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,251
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.

616
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:54,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.

617
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:58,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just a horrible thing that people shouldn't have to deal with.

618
00:47:58,033 --> 00:48:00,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially at his age.

619
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I appreciate Thank you, pop culture wasn't much but was thank you.

620
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:05,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

621
00:48:05,718 --> 00:48:08,259
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I anything is huge.

622
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:17,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you you know, again, I know you you get hit with like, multiple of these a week on the internet, even just helping to spread the word and all that.

623
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:18,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Super appreciated.

624
00:48:18,385 --> 00:48:20,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all so much and really appreciate it.

625
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:24,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to say on that Loki?

626
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:25,629
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's it.

627
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:26,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

628
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on and talk about what else is going on in the gaming industry.

629
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:36,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So Loki, I will turn it over to you for our first story tonight.

630
00:48:36,909 --> 00:48:38,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is good and bad news.

631
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:59,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we kind of figured this was what was going to happen with Grand Theft Auto 6, but it has been confirmed, though, thanks to Take-Two's latest earnings report that the Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to come out fall of 2025 and it's supposed to hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.

632
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:11,252
[SPEAKER_04]: They said our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games previously established window of calendar 2025 to fall of calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto 6.

633
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:17,874
[SPEAKER_04]: We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience and full of monetization.

634
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:21,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I added that last part because that is exactly what they're going to do.

635
00:49:21,556 --> 00:49:24,797
[SPEAKER_05]: They they got to make up for those years development.

636
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: They love them some Grand Theft Auto Online shark cards, and you better believe that they are going to be monetizing the hell out of this.

637
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:52,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with that, though, of course, there was an IGN interview with Strauss Zelnick, and they impressed him on what made them decide to, you know, that Roll7 and Intercept Games to use

638
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,872
[SPEAKER_04]: What made them shut them down?

639
00:49:56,872 --> 00:50:06,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zelnick said, we didn't shutter those studios, we've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.

640
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they pushed, you know, for more definitive answer.

641
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:17,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's when a PR rep stepped in and say, oh, you know, referred back to their company's cost of reduction plan.

642
00:50:17,665 --> 00:50:26,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not, weirdly enough, they are not saying whether they closed those studios or not, despite the fact that studios is like, yeah, they closed.

643
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:29,302
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's evidence that we've been shut down.

644
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:31,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Like.

645
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:31,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

646
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:32,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't understand.

647
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:47,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with that, apparently in the Rockstar PC launcher code, it was spotted that a PC version of Red Dead Redemption, the first one was inside of there.

648
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So there had some descriptions for the game.

649
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:52,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they had product promotion.

650
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:56,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It's talking about like, you know, zombie.

651
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:59,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the zombie uprising DLC?

652
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:01,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also talking about Red Dead Redemption.

653
00:51:01,278 --> 00:51:01,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So

654
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:06,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that means that we're getting Red Dead Redemption on PC as well.

655
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:12,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because we haven't we haven't gotten to the second one's been on PC forever, but up the first one.

656
00:51:12,618 --> 00:51:13,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

657
00:51:15,814 --> 00:51:16,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be interesting.

658
00:51:16,555 --> 00:51:17,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for the mods.

659
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:20,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like with the second one, there's been some hilarious stuff out there.

660
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:38,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So exactly, you know, this, this does, you know, going back to the Grand Theft Auto six, um, part of this story, it's interesting because in a way, I kind of feel like this ties into what we talked about at the top of the show tonight, because I, I do truly believe Grand Theft Auto six is a system seller of, because this game will not be on PS4, correct?

661
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:41,293
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a PS5 and Series X and PC game.

662
00:51:41,293 --> 00:51:43,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and not PC out the gate either, right?

663
00:51:43,735 --> 00:51:44,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're not PC.

664
00:51:44,876 --> 00:51:45,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for PC.

665
00:51:45,976 --> 00:51:53,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So Grand Theft Auto 6 will be a system seller.

666
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's very interesting that this is on the horizon.

667
00:51:58,162 --> 00:52:00,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Sony's been waiting and waiting for this and Microsoft too.

668
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:17,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I hate, I don't want to sound like a fanboy or bias, but I really do feel like PlayStation will benefit more than Xbox, just because I feel like this series has always existed mainly in people know it associated with PlayStation and people just kind of tie the name to it.

669
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:18,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a lot of that name recognition.

670
00:52:18,914 --> 00:52:29,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really do think Sony will probably benefit from this a little more than Microsoft, unless Microsoft plays their cards right with the marketing, puts it on Game Pass, LOL, JK, that would never happen.

671
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, you know, does not a right way.

672
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think PlayStation would benefit more

673
00:52:38,464 --> 00:52:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be interesting if they do the cross buy with that.

674
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:44,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think a lot of third, I don't know how many third party games do that.

675
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:48,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But like if they, you know, you buy it on Xbox, you get it on Xbox.

676
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:52,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto has to do none of those nice things to be able to sell oodles and oodles.

677
00:52:52,293 --> 00:52:52,714
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

678
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they won't.

679
00:52:54,575 --> 00:53:04,422
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think this is the system seller that ironically, to loop back to the top of the show, I think there are going to be people that are like, Okay, I'm going to get a PlayStation 5 now just to play this game.

680
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe this is why we have these rumors of the PlayStation 5 Pro.

681
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:13,087
[SPEAKER_05]: and the refresh, which in turn will bring down the prices of the original PlayStation fives.

682
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,768
[SPEAKER_05]: If they make them both concurrently, they may not.

683
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:18,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be very interesting to see what happens with all this.

684
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:24,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So next year, I mean, it's a long time to wait if you're Sony, but.

685
00:53:24,252 --> 00:53:27,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to move a lot of consoles next year.

686
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:37,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I would just say if you're looking to pick up PlayStation five, maybe just wait a little bit longer to see what see what shakes out towards the end of the year, too, because, you know, there's probably going to be refreshes coming

687
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty soon, I would imagine.

688
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We may even hear some announcements of those pretty soon.

689
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

690
00:53:43,892 --> 00:53:44,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait until the end of summer.

691
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:50,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in chat says there is no need for a PS5 Pro or an Xbox Series X Pro.

692
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:55,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if rumors would be believed, a PlayStation 5 Pro is coming.

693
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:56,815
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

694
00:53:56,815 --> 00:54:07,443
[SPEAKER_05]: If this game in particular has technical advancements on a PS5 Pro, that will absolutely be a selling point for a PS5 Pro.

695
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:10,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

696
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:11,586
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be that big of a game.

697
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:20,053
[SPEAKER_05]: unless word gets out that it's Garbaggio and has microtransactions out the wazoo.

698
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:21,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of I kind of think it won't matter.

699
00:54:21,994 --> 00:54:23,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I think tons of people are still going to buy.

700
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:25,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it will be garbage.

701
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:26,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to be.

702
00:54:26,136 --> 00:54:29,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's probably saying it'll be like Grand Theft Auto 5.

703
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:33,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine single player, no microtransactions online.

704
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,081
[SPEAKER_05]: All the microtransactions.

705
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:39,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Prepare your wallet because it's going to be a transaction fest.

706
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:39,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

707
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:45,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, if that is a game that is not up your alley, perhaps this game would be.

708
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:53,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I should stress this is still in a rumor status, but it's one of those, you know, apparently where there's smoke, there's fire.

709
00:54:53,403 --> 00:55:00,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And it appears that hundreds of players may be already participating in a closed alpha of Valve's next game.

710
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:04,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is called Deadlock.

711
00:55:04,393 --> 00:55:07,895
[SPEAKER_05]: This has apparently been in the works since 2018.

712
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:13,618
[SPEAKER_05]: IceFrog is apparently the developer behind the game who made an original Dota mod.

713
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:17,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I'm sorry, that's the individual, or I don't know if that's an individual or a company that's in charge.

714
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:22,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not uncommon for Valve to take mod makers and have them make full games.

715
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:24,484
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually happens a lot over at Valve.

716
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:31,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Neon Prime was the original name of this project, and now it's known as Deadlock.

717
00:55:31,988 --> 00:55:41,712
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been reported by both Tyler McVicker, who is a veteran Valve reporter, and a content creator named Gabe Follower, which, you know, would know a thing or two about Valve, I assume.

718
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:46,835
[SPEAKER_05]: They have both, through independent means, confirmed this is happening and it's in an advanced state of development.

719
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Valorant, Overwatch, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2

720
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:10,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think even though a lot of people are reporting that this is very similar to Overwatch, it sounds like there is a lane battle mechanic in this game that's very similar to Dota.

721
00:56:10,892 --> 00:56:19,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So it actually kind of brings Smite to mind, which is a third person lane game, but a shooter, which Smite is not.

722
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:23,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be a very interesting sort of medium.

723
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:24,925
[SPEAKER_05]: E3VL says so Marvel rivals.

724
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:29,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is interesting that all of these Overwatch competitors are coming up at once.

725
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:34,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like Overwatch has exposed its weak point.

726
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:35,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Overwatch 2

727
00:56:56,477 --> 00:56:59,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is Valve really stealing or are they buying them off themselves?

728
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:00,740
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do Team Fortress 3.

729
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to make a new IP so we can do Team Fortress 3.

730
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:03,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

731
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:04,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

732
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:06,105
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't Team Fortress 3.

733
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:08,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely, yeah, SSJ1 had that.

734
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that clear.

735
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:12,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Deadlock, parentheses, totally not Team Fortress 3.

736
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally not.

737
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:15,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Team Fortress 2

738
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but goes on sale a lot.

739
00:57:41,151 --> 00:57:44,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know, we'll see how much this actually costs.

740
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:51,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a good feeling it may be in the free to play or super cheap sort of realm, like $20 type of realm.

741
00:57:51,754 --> 00:57:55,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Comparisons as well the Bioshock Infinite and the Skyhook system.

742
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:58,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we say like fantasy steampunk, think that sort of thing.

743
00:57:58,336 --> 00:58:00,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that could be very interesting.

744
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:05,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, around the corner is our E3 Memorial Announcement Week.

745
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,682
[SPEAKER_05]: What a good time that would be to announce something like this, wouldn't it?

746
00:58:08,682 --> 00:58:11,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you're in a closed alpha right now.

747
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The plot thickens.

748
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:15,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So all right, we'll see.

749
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:16,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, Loki.

750
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yes.

751
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:24,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So something I've been dealing with is Fallout 4 constantly updating thanks to Bethesda.

752
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:27,066
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is they're not really fixing things.

753
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:46,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bethesda, of course, launched their next gen update on April 25th that was supposed to bring, you know, you know, 60 FPS gameplay and, you know, better visuals on console and then on PC also kind of similar type of stuff, adding more

754
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:51,119
[SPEAKER_04]: visual flair to the game.

755
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,842
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is there's mods that did that way better.

756
00:58:54,842 --> 00:59:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they patched it, it broke all those mods as well.

757
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:05,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, the patch itself still was bugged as well.

758
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:16,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It also didn't fix any or fix some of the issues that they've been having from the get go and added even more issues that needed to be fixed.

759
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:22,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Now follow that up with on May 13th, the next gen update 2.

760
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:25,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their patch for their patch to fix some issues.

761
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:27,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

762
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:30,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still not fixing all these issues.

763
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:33,114
[SPEAKER_04]: However, on console, though, it has.

764
00:59:33,855 --> 00:59:42,099
[SPEAKER_04]: apparently caused some more crashes on PlayStation 5, including a annoying red texture bug that has been fixed.

765
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,220
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

766
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, I'm sorry, fewer crashes on PlayStation 5.

767
00:59:46,001 --> 00:59:48,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least it's fixing stuff on console.

768
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:52,865
[SPEAKER_04]: But on PC, though, it is actually breaking.

769
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:57,107
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's still quests are broken.

770
00:59:57,107 --> 01:00:01,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's lacking ultra wide screen options on PC.

771
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:12,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like they're using a really old engine and they can't figure out how to program a good game because Starfield, perfect example.

772
01:00:12,212 --> 01:00:18,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So funny enough, players on PC have been kind of begging Bethesda.

773
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:20,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please stop patching the game?

774
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Just leave it alone.

775
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:23,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Just leave it be.

776
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:26,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us be able to play the game like we want to.

777
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not making it better.

778
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:27,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making it worse.

779
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,905
[SPEAKER_05]: How often in gaming's history do you hear a fanbase go, please stop patching your game?

780
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:36,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Please stop making improvements.

781
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:37,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not improving.

782
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:45,176
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, if you don't improve your game, if you make it worse by patching it, then yeah, maybe maybe don't.

783
01:00:46,638 --> 01:00:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: do that?

784
01:00:47,298 --> 01:00:55,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe you know, here's an idea since these, you know, patches in like, quality of life improvements have been out there in mod form already.

785
01:00:55,681 --> 01:01:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why didn't they take some of that and incorporate that into the game to optimize those people?

786
01:01:02,344 --> 01:01:05,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna guess I don't know.

787
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:07,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they paid someone to develop this stuff.

788
01:01:07,586 --> 01:01:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So

789
01:01:09,857 --> 01:01:15,705
[SPEAKER_05]: SheHulk10 does point out, still in its current state, Fallout 4 is a great game to play.

790
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:41,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, as a bit of a surprise, Epic Games has announced with a teaser image on their social media that Fortnite Battle Royale is getting Fallout content.

791
01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:43,071
[SPEAKER_04]: What that is?

792
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:47,334
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea, but it is something that, you know, probably cosmetics

793
01:01:48,086 --> 01:01:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a teaser image of it, so we're going to have to wait and see.

794
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be maybe TV show related, like specific characters in the TV show?

795
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:57,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

796
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:00,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like TV show content, at least to the screenshot.

797
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:04,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, maybe.

798
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:06,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Because apparently TV shows doing great.

799
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, tie in that way, too.

800
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:10,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

801
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:11,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

802
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:19,054
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's talk about something pretty cool for accessibility that's happening over at Microsoft.

803
01:02:19,054 --> 01:02:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a brand new controller that is going to be on the way out called the Proteus controller.

804
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:26,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I hope I hope I'm saying that right.

805
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:27,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this controller

806
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:41,042
[SPEAKER_05]: is gonna ship in the fall for $299, and I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but this is pretty cool what this controller can do, because it's actually something that is made to improve accessibility a little bit.

807
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:51,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you actually look at some of the screenshots of this thing, and for those of you that are watching live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, I'll show you some pictures from this article I'm looking at that actually show you how this controller, it kind of looks like

808
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:55,149
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

809
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:30,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really good news if you're a one-handed gamer or potentially a player with disabilities or limited a Disability or limited mobility you could actually use this in a different configuration So for example, you see a screenshot there for those that are watching live where all the cubes are kind of in a line but you could also arrange it in this sort of way where it's a little bit more like a cube and so it's like the

810
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:41,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the little controller analog stick is on the side and like your trigger buttons are on top, you know, you could do this a little bit of a different way.

811
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:43,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything on this is remappable.

812
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have to use a companion app to do it, but it will work.

813
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:53,552
[SPEAKER_05]: At launch, it will only work with the Series X and S systems as well as Xbox One and Windows 10 and 11.

814
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:56,674
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to pre-order this, you can get a discount, $255.

815
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:15,528
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually comes with a charging cable, unlike a lot of things right now in this day and age, if you want to pick that up.

816
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:17,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty cool.

817
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:31,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this is in addition to you may remember that Microsoft is already kind of at the forefront of a lot of these sort of accessibility things because there is that $99 adaptive controller and that was released in 2018.

818
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:34,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That controller is soon going to support more accessories.

819
01:04:34,874 --> 01:04:39,295
[SPEAKER_05]: USB ports will support up to 12 buttons, a second stick and a hat switch.

820
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:43,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, firmware switch is coming out in the next couple of weeks, it's said.

821
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:52,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, always nice to hear about things that are happening on that sort of development front to help more people be able to play games because gaming is for everyone.

822
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:55,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I, I just kind of, I mean, I don't know if I would pay

823
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:57,593
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

824
01:05:21,172 --> 01:05:31,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like the little, I don't know what they are on there, but they're kind of like the the covers for the other like for the parts that you're not using.

825
01:05:31,459 --> 01:05:35,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how it has like little logos or graphics on there.

826
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:37,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cool to like customize that stuff as well.

827
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like it's an accessibility controller, but at least that you can make it look cool, too.

828
01:05:43,136 --> 01:05:49,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Martello4 in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, it could be something that changes the way you game with a controller.

829
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:58,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it kind of makes me think about like those, those trackball people out there, which DarkSakura is one of them, by the way, you know, she's talked about her love of the trackball here.

830
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people use it for ergonomic reasons as well.

831
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:03,882
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes me think of that, that like so often we talk about mouse and keyboard, mouse and keyboard.

832
01:06:04,242 --> 01:06:09,583
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a trackball person, that like changes a lot, like the inverted mouse sort of thing, right?

833
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:14,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of makes me think of that, that yeah, this could actually change the way you think about controllers.

834
01:06:14,824 --> 01:06:22,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, whether that's an accessibility thing for you, or it's just kind of a neat way to reconfigure something.

835
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:27,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, or as pod culture wants me to say, a rad way to configure something there.

836
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

837
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:29,841
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

838
01:06:29,841 --> 01:06:32,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, all for those new controllers.

839
01:06:32,202 --> 01:06:37,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that would be Microsoft's second venture into this realm for this particular cycle of consoles.

840
01:06:37,725 --> 01:06:38,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's cool.

841
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:48,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is, to be fair, it is this other company making it kind of like for Microsoft, which is a little different, but still very cool.

842
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:53,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, this is a very interesting follow up to something we were talking about quite a bit last week.

843
01:06:54,102 --> 01:06:56,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcane Austin shut down due to bug fixes for Redfall

844
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:15,366
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Arkane Austin has actually said, Thank you for your support of messages.

845
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:24,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We are working to release our final update, the game update for that will bring revamped neighborhood, nest system, single player pausing, offline mode and more.

846
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:27,677
[SPEAKER_04]: More will provide additional details soon.

847
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:28,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.

848
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently we are going to be getting that final patch, which is nice because then it might make the game playable.

849
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:35,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my question.

850
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:37,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you play it?

851
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:37,346
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

852
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:45,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm kind of curious without the studio being out there to really market this game, it's going to be interesting to see how this is promoted.

853
01:07:45,005 --> 01:07:52,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine they're going to try to really get people through Game Pass and try to point this out as a perk of Game Pass, you know, especially with, you know, some of the games.

854
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:55,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Play games for studios we've closed down.

855
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:57,850
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's these hot, hot rumors out there.

856
01:07:59,131 --> 01:07:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty

857
01:08:16,753 --> 01:08:21,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be a guy that used to play Call of Duty's campaigns and Call of Duty is fun.

858
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:28,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it used to be fun when we can kind of do like LAN stuff with it and like just play in a small group of friends.

859
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:31,433
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to play with randos on the Internet.

860
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:31,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's.

861
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:39,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That time is long gone, unfortunately, because I haven't played Call of Duty in forever.

862
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:42,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just isn't the game that it used to be.

863
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I don't play a single player campaign anymore.

864
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:48,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not interested in Call of Duty anymore.

865
01:08:48,009 --> 01:08:51,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, can I not pay the upcharge for Call of Duty?

866
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:52,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Can that be its own tier, please?

867
01:08:52,613 --> 01:08:59,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, quite honestly, if they up the price of Game Pass, I'm going to really consider cutting back from Ultimate, which is what I have now, to just PC.

868
01:09:00,945 --> 01:09:05,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the thing is like I'm not using it at all and every month, you know?

869
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:05,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

870
01:09:07,014 --> 01:09:08,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but, but I mean, I don't know.

871
01:09:08,675 --> 01:09:12,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I might, I just feel like my gaming backlog is so fucking big right now.

872
01:09:12,037 --> 01:09:13,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I have so many games to catch up on.

873
01:09:13,658 --> 01:09:22,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be curious about Redfall offline mode, but I just, realistically, am I going to get to it when I can't stop playing the same fucking games for the past, like five years?

874
01:09:22,923 --> 01:09:23,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

875
01:09:23,543 --> 01:09:23,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

876
01:09:23,904 --> 01:09:25,544
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's neat that it's happening.

877
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:26,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I don't know.

878
01:09:26,945 --> 01:09:31,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's weird that it's, it's like, it kind of sucks the studio closed.

879
01:09:31,388 --> 01:09:33,469
[SPEAKER_05]: You like want to be happy that this is coming.

880
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:56,493
[SPEAKER_04]: but at the same time it's like oh but the people that made it aren't there anymore so like yeah I mean perfect example like Volition like it sucks that they closed because their last few games were kind of terrible but like there was somebody there at one time that was working on a patch for Saints Row 2 that would have been awesome if it ever did release for PC this was a fix like

881
01:09:57,205 --> 01:10:02,209
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these things that were broken with it and then we're never going to get that.

882
01:10:02,209 --> 01:10:03,350
[SPEAKER_04]: That's never coming.

883
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:09,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Rama in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says just use discount codes for game pass four months for 30 bucks.

884
01:10:09,575 --> 01:10:11,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, I sort of did.

885
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:17,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought I bought Xbox cards at Costco, which you can get $90 worth of cards for 100 bucks.

886
01:10:18,743 --> 01:10:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: or no, that would that would not be a good deal other way.

887
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I should not play deal or no deal because I would not be good at it.

888
01:10:25,827 --> 01:10:29,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Other way around you get $100 worth of cards for 90 bucks at Costco.

889
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:31,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I did something with that.

890
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:37,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just paid for like a year, which you know, the more the more you buy up front, the less a hit it is to your wallet.

891
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:37,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So

892
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:53,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also like to use the redeem the rewards but it's it's so much harder to do the rewards now I am not as actively checking the rewards because I don't use my Series X as much as I used to ever since I got a better computer.

893
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:57,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I got a computer that was just as good as the modern consoles.

894
01:10:57,363 --> 01:11:01,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I've really not been playing my consoles a lot unless it's an exclusive.

895
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I been playing my PlayStation 5 since Final Fantasy 16?

896
01:11:04,987 --> 01:11:06,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, not really.

897
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:08,068
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, but not really.

898
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:17,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we are going to take a trip back to a time before offline when all games were offline.

899
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:22,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, actually, maybe this particular one, you might have had a modem mode.

900
01:11:22,497 --> 01:11:24,640
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of this was offline.

901
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get to the segment.

902
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:43,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vaults and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

903
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:46,447
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

904
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:55,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but since DarkSakura isn't here tonight, she's away at the Pinball Expo, I am gonna step in and do the Classic Game of the Week.

905
01:11:55,069 --> 01:12:13,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And I picked a real old one from the archives, but I think this is one... I don't know how many of you are gonna know this one, and I really hope you do, because I think this led to an entire series of games that probably still sits on the shelf at Target that I don't know how much y'all pay attention to.

906
01:12:13,101 --> 01:12:14,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So you ready for this?

907
01:12:14,222 --> 01:12:16,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, the Classic Game of the Week is...

908
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:21,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Hoyle's Book of Games Volume 1

909
01:12:36,946 --> 01:12:39,367
[SPEAKER_05]: but there have been tons and tons of games in this series.

910
01:12:39,367 --> 01:12:42,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It started, I actually played this one that we're taking a look at tonight.

911
01:12:42,808 --> 01:12:47,970
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the very first game that came out in 1996, but there've been a ton of games in this series.

912
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:51,611
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a volume two, there was a volume three, which was also very good.

913
01:12:51,611 --> 01:12:53,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there was a volume four.

914
01:12:53,032 --> 01:13:01,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at that point, once Sierra put out four games, a new company called Encore Inc came in and took over the license and started putting out

915
01:13:01,775 --> 01:13:02,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons.

916
01:13:02,155 --> 01:13:04,678
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like at least 20 of these types of games.

917
01:13:04,678 --> 01:13:08,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And you probably have seen these games like sitting on the shelf of Target.

918
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:16,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, Hoyle Puzzle Board Games and Hoyle Mahjong and Hoyle Card Puzzle and Board Games from 2013.

919
01:13:16,488 --> 01:13:21,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a Hoyle Card Game on the Game Boy Color and all of that.

920
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um,

921
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably have picked up some type of Hoil game at some point in the past.

922
01:13:27,262 --> 01:13:28,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I played this game.

923
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:31,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks familiar, but I don't remember.

924
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:33,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a blast from the past.

925
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:37,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I knew Bobby Blackwolf would know this one because I know he knows his Sierra.

926
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:38,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was this.

927
01:13:38,808 --> 01:13:42,490
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had a Roland MT-32, like I know he did.

928
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,671
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, you know, it had the soundtrack to go with it.

929
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:53,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And those of you that are watching the game live on Twitch right now we're playing the gameplay, you'll notice some of the characters in the game are Sierra characters.

930
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:56,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So you actually have Graham from King's Quest.

931
01:13:56,035 --> 01:14:03,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that is Rosalina and that might be Larry Laffler from Leisure Suit Larry.

932
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:06,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were some game there were some characters from Sierra Games.

933
01:14:06,919 --> 01:14:10,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there were some characters in there that were actually based off Sierra staff.

934
01:14:11,081 --> 01:14:18,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never knew that until I did the research for tonight, is that some of that was actually Sierra staff.

935
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:20,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby in chat says, this is the only Hoyle game I played.

936
01:14:20,966 --> 01:14:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't need any of the others.

937
01:14:22,286 --> 01:14:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you're missing out like two and three and four.

938
01:14:25,448 --> 01:14:28,749
[SPEAKER_05]: The other Sierra ones, especially two and three.

939
01:14:28,749 --> 01:14:32,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Three was great because three had all the board games in it.

940
01:14:32,611 --> 01:14:50,736
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'll talk again I want to focus on one tonight but we'll get into two and three just because I don't know when we'll ever get a chance to feature this series again and it is like a I think these are games that are like I shouldn't be telling you that these are games that you could play for free online at the archive.org online thing but

941
01:14:51,736 --> 01:14:53,037
[SPEAKER_05]: WinkNudge, okay?

942
01:14:53,037 --> 01:14:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So... And honestly, you should check it out.

943
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Because again, look at what this series led to.

944
01:14:59,902 --> 01:15:03,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's all these types of card and board games that are out there.

945
01:15:03,085 --> 01:15:08,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I played the shit out of this game because this actually had a game in it.

946
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:12,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were six games in the original Volume 1.

947
01:15:12,672 --> 01:15:16,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy Eights, which you're seeing on the screen now, Old Maid,

948
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:31,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearts, JinRummy, Klondike, which is what most people just know as Solitaire, and then Kribbage was the key game for me because, and I think I've talked about this on the show before, Kribbage was a game that my grandpa taught me how to play.

949
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:33,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a little bit of a niche game.

950
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little bit of a retirement home type of game.

951
01:15:35,892 --> 01:15:41,617
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've actually, I kind of remember how to play Kribbage.

952
01:15:42,398 --> 01:15:44,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think I remember completely.

953
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:49,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if I were to go play a game like this online, it would remind me very easy how to play it.

954
01:15:49,925 --> 01:15:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, even watching the YouTube of the people playing tonight kind of reminded me, oh, that's right.

955
01:15:55,349 --> 01:16:00,554
[SPEAKER_05]: You deal six cards, then you pick two cards to go in the dealer's crib so that they have like the secret hand.

956
01:16:00,874 --> 01:16:14,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you do the playing and you play to 31 and then there's like the 15.2, 15.4, you know, you count your points and all the points are tabulated on those infamous cribbage boards that look like the, you know, like swirlies and they had different modifiers for cribbage boards over the years.

957
01:16:14,145 --> 01:16:14,506
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

958
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I got really into cribbage because that's something that my grandpa taught me how to play.

959
01:16:19,991 --> 01:16:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that I could play this on my PC was really cool.

960
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:26,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby Blackwell said, this is how I learned cribbage.

961
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

962
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:30,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And RecordWN says, oh, like the playing card company.

963
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's where it comes from.

964
01:16:32,702 --> 01:16:38,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So the series is named after Edmund Hoyle, who was a playing card expert.

965
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:42,511
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also trademarks and designs from the Hoyle brand of playing cards,

966
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:49,474
[SPEAKER_05]: which were licensed under Brown and Bigelow, which is the company that I guess held them when this game first came out.

967
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:53,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the opponents kind of had their own personas.

968
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:56,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could play these different types of games in there.

969
01:16:56,358 --> 01:17:00,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And the characters that you're playing against would actually comment along the way.

970
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:06,663
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Larry Lafler would comment about women because you know, it was this is a game of a different time.

971
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:08,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So he would make you know, those types of comments.

972
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:13,206
[SPEAKER_05]: and other characters and some of you have been pointing out in chat Roger Wilco is in the game.

973
01:17:13,206 --> 01:17:14,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

974
01:17:14,506 --> 01:17:15,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Characters from Police Quest.

975
01:17:15,846 --> 01:17:16,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

976
01:17:16,046 --> 01:17:16,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

977
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:19,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So Roger Wilco would say he wants to go out and save the universe again.

978
01:17:19,808 --> 01:17:21,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all of that.

979
01:17:21,768 --> 01:17:33,332
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was originally developed by Warren Schwader, who actually took the concept to Ken Williams, who I believe ended up being a producer on this game of the infamous duo of Ken and Roberta Williams.

980
01:17:33,332 --> 01:17:36,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Warren ended up being the lead programmer and the game designer.

981
01:17:36,913 --> 01:17:44,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it looks like other Sierra online games, that's because this game was made with SCI, Sierra Creative Interpreter.

982
01:17:44,236 --> 01:17:54,541
[SPEAKER_05]: SCI was supposed to be made to do adventure games like King's Quest and, you know, that's why they all felt a little bit familiar as they were all done in SCI, but this game was done in SCI as well.

983
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a little bit of a challenge because you had to do AI for the different characters and all that.

984
01:17:59,144 --> 01:18:15,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Warren actually continued as the lead programmer and game designer for the next two games in the series, and Rob Atislap, I hope I said that right, was the composer and sound designer for those same games, which is why I think this series kind of changed when you started to get into the fourth game.

985
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:19,746
[SPEAKER_05]: because the creative minds behind it changed.

986
01:18:19,746 --> 01:18:25,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying they were bad, but it just kind of like they don't, the games beyond three were not as memorable to me.

987
01:18:25,931 --> 01:18:27,452
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just what it is.

988
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,694
[SPEAKER_05]: This game sold a quarter of a million copies by 1990.

989
01:18:29,694 --> 01:18:34,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I will mention briefly some of the other games that came later, but I will mention those in chat too.

990
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:40,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks in chat are saying like, oh yeah, this looks like Vegas Steaks.

991
01:18:40,121 --> 01:18:41,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Who said that it was Vegas Steaks?

992
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:42,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was a very

993
01:18:43,984 --> 01:18:46,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Martell04, RemindsMeOfVegasSteaks

994
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:08,949
[SPEAKER_05]: that also I think probably drew inspiration from that, because I think that was a HAL Laboratories game, which Vegas Stakes ended up being as well.

995
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:12,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if somebody in chat will remember, what was the original NES game?

996
01:19:12,011 --> 01:19:14,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It had like, you walked around a casino and played Blackjack or something.

997
01:19:14,813 --> 01:19:17,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Vegas Stakes was also heavily inspired by that.

998
01:19:17,394 --> 01:19:21,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But like all great video games, they all end up inspiring each other.

999
01:19:21,797 --> 01:19:23,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Vegas Dream?

1000
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:24,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, OrangeRite, that does sound right.

1001
01:19:24,379 --> 01:19:26,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Vegas Dream, I think that is right.

1002
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:27,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll highlight that game another week.

1003
01:19:29,662 --> 01:19:32,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't know how much else there is to say about this game.

1004
01:19:32,223 --> 01:19:36,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I could talk about a couple of the other games in the Hoyle series real quick.

1005
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:41,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Hoyle Book of Games Volume 2 went up to 28 games.

1006
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:54,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't name them all because they get a little obscure, kind of like some of the Nintendo Clubhouse Games collections, but Pyramid, Poker Square, Strategy, Flower Garden, Golf, so it gets a little, you know, in the weeds there.

1007
01:19:55,071 --> 01:20:00,014
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when you get into Volume 3, it started to get into board games.

1008
01:20:00,014 --> 01:20:13,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Volume 3 had Backgammon, Checkers, Dominoes, Yacht, which was the original Yahtzee, because Yahtzee is a trademark, Pachizi, and Snakes and Ladders, as opposed to Chutes and Ladders, because again, trademarks.

1009
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:15,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was all board games, which was fun.

1010
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:24,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, because it was from 91, and I think it was made in a different engine, you started to get more of the CD-ROM looking characters, but you still had Larry, you still had Graham, you still had Rosella.

1011
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:25,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You still had a lot of that.

1012
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:28,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually split into good guys and bad guys, which I thought was interesting.

1013
01:20:28,713 --> 01:20:38,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So then when they got into volume four, volume four was a remake of volume one, but with better graphics, basically.

1014
01:20:38,859 --> 01:20:41,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where the series started to go from there.

1015
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the the Hoyle games ended up everywhere.

1016
01:20:44,802 --> 01:20:47,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I loved this game.

1017
01:20:47,664 --> 01:20:50,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a lot of this game and two and three.

1018
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,006
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, I play.

1019
01:20:51,006 --> 01:20:52,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember buying all of these.

1020
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:52,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

1021
01:20:53,769 --> 01:20:54,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be real.

1022
01:20:54,590 --> 01:21:00,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked mommy and daddy very nicely if I got good grades to buy me these games, the first three in the series.

1023
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:01,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did.

1024
01:21:01,474 --> 01:21:03,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have them all and I really loved them.

1025
01:21:03,195 --> 01:21:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I've picked it for you all tonight.

1026
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:07,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So go forth.

1027
01:21:07,678 --> 01:21:10,220
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandpa is, of course, no longer with us.

1028
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,801
[SPEAKER_05]: You can probably guess I'm in my 40s.

1029
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:14,483
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandpa's no longer with us.

1030
01:21:14,483 --> 01:21:18,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky you, if you are in your 40s, your grandpa still with you.

1031
01:21:18,285 --> 01:21:20,507
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's moved on.

1032
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:23,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But the love of cribbage is something I will remember him by.

1033
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:32,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, if I if I can air a bit of a personal grievance, which I probably shouldn't do here on the show, but I'm going to anyway.

1034
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:37,034
[SPEAKER_05]: When my grandpa passed away, there was one thing that I wanted.

1035
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:39,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted his old cribbage board.

1036
01:21:39,415 --> 01:21:47,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you know that they let other friends of his come into the house first and take the things they wanted before they let some of the other family members come in the house take things they wanted?

1037
01:21:47,598 --> 01:21:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: My my understanding was they actually wanted to give me their car.

1038
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:54,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't even get that.

1039
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:57,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And I let me I want to stress this.

1040
01:21:57,582 --> 01:21:59,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't care about the fucking car.

1041
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:01,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted the cribbage board.

1042
01:22:01,144 --> 01:22:05,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And to this day, I'm still really salty that I didn't get that.

1043
01:22:06,641 --> 01:22:13,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not to bring up too much personal drama, but some of these types of connections with games are really fucking important.

1044
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:14,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just putting it out there.

1045
01:22:14,824 --> 01:22:21,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, all that aside, I can still enjoy Cribbage through Hoyle and other modern interpretations of it.

1046
01:22:21,287 --> 01:22:24,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, honestly, I don't see Cribbage in a lot of modern games.

1047
01:22:24,248 --> 01:22:28,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think it was in Nintendo's thing, if I remember right.

1048
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, was it not in, um...

1049
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,749
[SPEAKER_04]: the 3DS one I had or it might have been I don't think it was in the Switch one.

1050
01:22:35,749 --> 01:22:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it's called now.

1051
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:38,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The Switch one, Clubhouse.

1052
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:39,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Clubhouse Games.

1053
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:39,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1054
01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:44,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was the original Clubhouse Games and there was they called it something else for the Switch.

1055
01:22:44,013 --> 01:22:44,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

1056
01:22:44,494 --> 01:22:46,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Worldwide Classics or something like that.

1057
01:22:46,254 --> 01:22:46,755
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1058
01:22:46,755 --> 01:22:47,035
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1059
01:22:47,035 --> 01:22:48,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was games around the world.

1060
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:48,916
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it was.

1061
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:49,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're right.

1062
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:52,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Worldwide Classics.

1063
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:53,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it list the games?

1064
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not.

1065
01:22:53,818 --> 01:22:55,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Because why would we do that?

1066
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,780
[SPEAKER_05]: PodCulture in chat says, I don't even know what the fuck Cribbage is.

1067
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's your chance to go learn.

1068
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:05,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the game's archive, or if you can find a legit copy of this game, hey, go for it.

1069
01:23:05,822 --> 01:23:09,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's be real, you're probably going to find this on an abandonware site somewhere.

1070
01:23:09,763 --> 01:23:15,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Go forth and learn how to play because I think I skipped by it when I did the video, but let me go.

1071
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:16,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still playing on the other screen here.

1072
01:23:16,564 --> 01:23:23,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe actually in the very beginning, I think the person recording this YouTube also did not know how to play Cribbage.

1073
01:23:23,786 --> 01:23:26,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So it actually does walk you through the rules.

1074
01:23:26,307 --> 01:23:30,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Although at some point in the rules, it says there's more.

1075
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:37,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last screen here says there's more information in the book because I and I get it.

1076
01:23:37,209 --> 01:23:39,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't explain all of the different county.

1077
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:39,790
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1078
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:44,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Please see Hoyle's Rules of Games for complete instructions.

1079
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the copy protection.

1080
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:50,693
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual how to how to play the game fully was in the manual.

1081
01:23:52,515 --> 01:23:57,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you, Matt, for that convenient link that I won't point out in chat, but it is there.

1082
01:23:57,498 --> 01:23:58,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1083
01:23:58,178 --> 01:23:59,419
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1084
01:23:59,419 --> 01:24:00,640
[SPEAKER_05]: That was your classic game of the week.

1085
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Hoyle's official book of games.

1086
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:03,561
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to say volume one.

1087
01:24:03,561 --> 01:24:09,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I touched on a little bit of the entire series tonight, because again, I don't know if I'll get a chance to do volume two and three later on.

1088
01:24:09,205 --> 01:24:11,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there you go.

1089
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:13,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does not have cribbage.

1090
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Involute.

1091
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:16,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, not Clubhouse Games.

1092
01:24:16,701 --> 01:24:17,302
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it doesn't.

1093
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,743
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, it does not.

1094
01:24:18,743 --> 01:24:21,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also not in alphabetical order.

1095
01:24:21,584 --> 01:24:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Nintendo.

1096
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:24,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1097
01:24:24,466 --> 01:24:25,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do this?

1098
01:24:25,586 --> 01:24:27,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they might.

1099
01:24:27,488 --> 01:24:31,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it called Crib in another?

1100
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:32,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's always been Cribbage.

1101
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's a trademark name.

1102
01:24:33,751 --> 01:24:38,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I think because like I think there's different companies that sell Cribbage boards.

1103
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:38,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1104
01:24:39,065 --> 01:24:50,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, where my cribbage fans at email the show participate at orange launch radio.com maybe maybe one of these days we'll do a tournament for charity.

1105
01:24:50,235 --> 01:24:51,677
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1106
01:24:51,677 --> 01:24:57,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to some other headlines in the segment we call rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on in the industry Loki.

1107
01:24:59,044 --> 01:25:03,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the timing of this couldn't be any more perfect.

1108
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:13,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we were joking about video game product placement and stuff, and we mentioned Final Fantasy with Cup Noodles and stuff, and sure enough,

1109
01:25:14,366 --> 01:25:21,610
[SPEAKER_04]: A few days later, Final Fantasy 14 players can unlock Mountain Zoo.

1110
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,151
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1111
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:30,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a special mount that you can get in Final Fantasy and Zoo being, you know, a flying bird creature in the game.

1112
01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:34,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's Mountain Zoo that you can get by drinking Mountain Dew.

1113
01:25:34,798 --> 01:25:43,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And along with that, yes, it's redeeming codes on the drink until up to July 14th is when they'll be available.

1114
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cool.

1115
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:56,657
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not, this is not the first time Final Fantasy has done this, by the way, there was a promotion with Butterfinger a few years ago, you may or may not recall, and you could get a mount that way too.

1116
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:57,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is not new.

1117
01:25:57,697 --> 01:26:01,820
[SPEAKER_05]: But by the way, this all ties into the Xbox promotion stuff.

1118
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:06,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's and trust me, I care because I play this game, there is no other way to get the mount and zoom out.

1119
01:26:06,483 --> 01:26:11,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it is a recoloring of a mount that exists in the game already, as most of these tend to be, but I still want it.

1120
01:26:11,547 --> 01:26:12,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Sparkling Citrus Refreshment Minion

1121
01:26:27,302 --> 01:26:33,148
[SPEAKER_05]: As somebody who's diabetic, and I've been very open about that on the show, I have type 2, and my blood sugar numbers are great.

1122
01:26:33,148 --> 01:26:37,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost weight, and no, I did not take the shot, but no shame if you had to.

1123
01:26:37,173 --> 01:26:40,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody does their weight loss journeys in different ways.

1124
01:26:40,717 --> 01:26:46,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was lucky enough that with a lot, a lot of walking and changing my diet, I was able to get things under control.

1125
01:26:46,963 --> 01:26:48,785
[SPEAKER_05]: For now, and that might change as I get older.

1126
01:26:49,406 --> 01:26:55,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But my point is, Mountain Dew is like literally the worst fucking drink.

1127
01:26:55,271 --> 01:26:59,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know how much sugar is in Mountain Dew, especially Mountain Dew Code Red.

1128
01:26:59,355 --> 01:27:02,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not good for you at all.

1129
01:27:02,578 --> 01:27:08,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I understand there's a lot of people out there that are drinking it, what have you, but it is not good.

1130
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,945
[SPEAKER_05]: If you drink it in moderation, then whatever.

1131
01:27:10,945 --> 01:27:13,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you can find these

1132
01:27:14,248 --> 01:27:20,630
[SPEAKER_05]: in bottles of Diet Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Zero, which are actually the zero drink.

1133
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:25,872
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, you don't want to drink too much of that, but I'm okay with drinking one of those every other day or so or whatever.

1134
01:27:25,872 --> 01:27:29,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But we were at Walmart yesterday.

1135
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but sometimes we're bored and we went to Walmart, like we're living in another town in the middle of nowhere.

1136
01:27:35,215 --> 01:27:37,076
[SPEAKER_05]: We were bored and we went to Walmart.

1137
01:27:37,076 --> 01:27:37,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And the

1138
01:27:38,616 --> 01:27:39,497
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, it was on Friday.

1139
01:27:39,497 --> 01:27:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't yesterday.

1140
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:40,898
[SPEAKER_05]: On Friday, we were bored.

1141
01:27:40,898 --> 01:27:45,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to Walmart, and I looked, and they had the Mountain Dew with all the codes.

1142
01:27:45,923 --> 01:27:49,146
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the code reds, the code purples, the code greens.

1143
01:27:49,146 --> 01:27:51,668
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have other names, but I don't know what they are.

1144
01:27:51,668 --> 01:27:53,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just call them code purple and code orange.

1145
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:56,139
[SPEAKER_05]: They had all that.

1146
01:27:56,139 --> 01:27:58,360
[SPEAKER_05]: They had zero Mountain Dew diets.

1147
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: They had zero Mountain Dew, zero calories.

1148
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm worried that those drinks are like the hardest ones to find, which sucks.

1149
01:28:05,441 --> 01:28:06,741
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all.

1150
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:08,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just feel a personal sense.

1151
01:28:08,522 --> 01:28:10,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shane was like, well, just buy him anyway.

1152
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:11,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him to Alan.

1153
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:12,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Alan's not going to drink him either.

1154
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:14,723
[SPEAKER_05]: He's he's trying to watch his intakes and all that.

1155
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:15,923
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't he doesn't want him.

1156
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,264
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, well, pour him down the sink.

1157
01:28:17,264 --> 01:28:22,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, honestly, for this mount, I might have to do it unless Loki wants.

1158
01:28:22,945 --> 01:28:24,205
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't even drink Mountain Dew either.

1159
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,737
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't like mom, do you?

1160
01:28:26,737 --> 01:28:27,597
[SPEAKER_05]: You.

1161
01:28:27,597 --> 01:28:30,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, DarkSakura, how are you?

1162
01:28:30,058 --> 01:28:31,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exhausted.

1163
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:34,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought you weren't going to make it tonight.

1164
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:39,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I rushed home and there is pizza at home and I have a pizza and my muscles have hatred.

1165
01:28:39,822 --> 01:28:40,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.

1166
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:40,683
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1167
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:42,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I played so much pinball.

1168
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:43,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's catch up with you in a minute.

1169
01:28:43,244 --> 01:28:48,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's finish Rapid Fire News and we'll come back and catch up on your pinball journey here real quick.

1170
01:28:48,586 --> 01:28:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: SG100 Matt in chat says, I remember Crystal Pepsi having 69 grams of sugar.

1171
01:28:52,608 --> 01:28:52,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1172
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, while that is nice, not really nice for your body.

1173
01:28:55,909 --> 01:28:57,069
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

1174
01:28:57,069 --> 01:29:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I don't want to say, I don't want to be the first person to sit up here and go, you shouldn't drink Mountain Dew.

1175
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:01,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad for you.

1176
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:05,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is, but you can do everything in moderation, right?

1177
01:29:05,952 --> 01:29:09,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Ice cream's bad for you too, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you not to eat it.

1178
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:10,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat it in moderation.

1179
01:29:10,373 --> 01:29:11,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

1180
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:15,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Mountain Dew is one of those things where even the Mountain Dew zero, I wouldn't drink all that in a day.

1181
01:29:15,974 --> 01:29:21,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have like one bottle every few days, but I could still get the mountain a week if I could find them.

1182
01:29:22,532 --> 01:29:24,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's do gelato.

1183
01:29:24,954 --> 01:29:26,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty yummy.

1184
01:29:26,356 --> 01:29:29,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Mountain Dew flavored things is pretty good.

1185
01:29:29,799 --> 01:29:33,682
[SPEAKER_05]: SSU 100 Matt says even Cookie Monster says he has cookies in moderation now.

1186
01:29:33,682 --> 01:29:36,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1187
01:29:36,224 --> 01:29:37,706
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1188
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1189
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:39,427
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

1190
01:29:39,427 --> 01:29:39,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1191
01:29:40,339 --> 01:29:52,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in fact, if you have too much Mountain Dew, you might end up fat and flatulent like this character, Wario, who, of course, folks are saying, you know, expecting the next Mario movie, obviously.

1192
01:29:52,362 --> 01:29:56,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been a campaign online to try to get Danny DeVito to play Wario.

1193
01:29:56,943 --> 01:29:59,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, yeah, I would do it.

1194
01:29:59,243 --> 01:30:00,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me a call.

1195
01:30:00,663 --> 01:30:02,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yes.

1196
01:30:02,244 --> 01:30:03,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And exactly.

1197
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, that does my response.

1198
01:30:05,485 --> 01:30:06,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Call him.

1199
01:30:06,565 --> 01:30:07,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Call him now.

1200
01:30:09,758 --> 01:30:10,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it happen, please.

1201
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, if he couldn't be Detective Pikachu, at least give us this.

1202
01:30:14,121 --> 01:30:17,423
[SPEAKER_05]: At least give us this, Nintendo.

1203
01:30:17,423 --> 01:30:21,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to personally speak to Miyamoto and tell him this needs to happen.

1204
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,727
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a brilliant idea.

1205
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:23,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Please make this happen.

1206
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:33,995
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, speaking of Miyamoto and Nintendo, some classic Game Boy games have made their way onto the Nintendo Switch Online service this week, including games I really can't believe weren't already there.

1207
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So what better time to release them than fucking randomly in the middle of May to finally release Super Mario Land is available finally on yeah, right.

1208
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw you make that face, Loki.

1209
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:46,439
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the face.

1210
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:48,099
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't already there.

1211
01:30:48,099 --> 01:30:48,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1212
01:30:48,959 --> 01:30:49,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1213
01:30:49,259 --> 01:30:49,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

1214
01:30:51,800 --> 01:31:12,419
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Alleyway, which was also kind of a, it was a launch title, I remember I owned that game out the gate too, it's basically Breakout or Arkanoid without the, you know, graphics and the Moai statue, but it was basically that, is also available now, and Baseball is also there, which was an early Game Boy release, so those are all available as well.

1215
01:31:12,419 --> 01:31:15,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan actually got an extra release, they got

1216
01:31:16,223 --> 01:31:18,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Kairu no tame ni kane wa naru

1217
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:25,577
[SPEAKER_05]: boy or something like that.

1218
01:31:25,577 --> 01:31:25,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang it.

1219
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:27,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I got to look it up because I forgot the name in a minute.

1220
01:31:27,818 --> 01:31:29,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The frog for whom the bell tolls.

1221
01:31:29,858 --> 01:31:31,018
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1222
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:37,159
[SPEAKER_05]: The frog for whom the bell tolls is that game that is additional in Japan, which I actually had never heard of.

1223
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,800
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looked kind of neat.

1224
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,600
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like it is heavy on the Japanese text.

1225
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's probably why you're not going to see a release that over here in the US.

1226
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:50,662
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, you can get those Japanese games if you create a Japanese online account.

1227
01:31:50,662 --> 01:31:52,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So something to think about.

1228
01:31:54,288 --> 01:31:55,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think I have one more.

1229
01:31:55,729 --> 01:31:56,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1230
01:31:56,290 --> 01:32:01,295
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play other classics, you can also check out the Taito Milestones collection.

1231
01:32:01,295 --> 01:32:04,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Taito Milestones 3 is on its way out.

1232
01:32:04,438 --> 01:32:08,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It is coming out on the Nintendo Switch in Winter 2024.

1233
01:32:08,562 --> 01:32:17,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, for a Taito collection, I can't believe some of these games weren't already released, such as Bubble Bobble.

1234
01:32:19,148 --> 01:32:28,835
[SPEAKER_05]: and Rainbow Islands, which are only two of the biggest IPs in their archive, but will finally make their way out with Taito Milestones 3.

1235
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:33,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other games too, Rastan Saga, which you probably have heard of that one too, is also be there.

1236
01:32:33,518 --> 01:32:36,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Then some other ones, maybe a little less known, but maybe you know them.

1237
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:42,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Kodash is in the collection too, Champion Wrestler, RuneArc, and ThunderFox.

1238
01:32:43,345 --> 01:32:46,508
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I think now's a good time to talk to you about what happened over the weekend.

1239
01:33:05,438 --> 01:33:15,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of feel inspired now because I have a translation of Kairi no Tame ni Kane wa Naru.

1240
01:33:15,786 --> 01:33:20,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the, I don't know how it'll come across, but I could give it a try.

1241
01:33:20,289 --> 01:33:22,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I like every part of it's translated.

1242
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:22,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

1243
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:26,614
[SPEAKER_01]: If it, if my copy still works, then I'll play it.

1244
01:33:26,614 --> 01:33:28,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, pinball, so much pinball.

1245
01:33:28,356 --> 01:33:31,058
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the, they showcased the Princess Bride.

1246
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:34,319
[SPEAKER_01]: with its incomplete code.

1247
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:38,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mean to me, but Dan had a really good play on it.

1248
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:41,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the Cliffs of Insanity and everything.

1249
01:33:41,861 --> 01:33:55,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people might have heard my voice doing commentary on the semifinal and the finals tournaments going on in pinball.

1250
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:58,046
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple of matches were pretty intense.

1251
01:34:00,747 --> 01:34:02,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got to play John Wick

1252
01:34:13,434 --> 01:34:22,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what I played of it was really fun, honestly, but people are complaining that there is no mention of gun violence in it.

1253
01:34:22,862 --> 01:34:26,505
[SPEAKER_01]: When like, hello, do you even know what this movie is?

1254
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:29,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a table, it's really fun to play.

1255
01:34:29,427 --> 01:34:30,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I quite enjoyed it.

1256
01:34:30,628 --> 01:34:35,592
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably still want to make sure that like family pizza places are willing to pick up the game and stuff like that.

1257
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:39,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think it's they sanitized it to make it more marketable is what they did.

1258
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:45,934
[SPEAKER_01]: then I wonder why then you know Jersey Jack didn't do that for Godfather or Guns N' Roses.

1259
01:34:47,441 --> 01:34:47,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1260
01:34:47,761 --> 01:34:52,846
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I mean, we even brought a couple of ours like we brought Shadow.

1261
01:34:52,846 --> 01:35:00,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it was ours when I played it because, you know, we cycle things out sometimes, but it has like a full on gun as the ball launch.

1262
01:35:00,993 --> 01:35:05,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, so did the original Guns N' Roses table that I'm thinking of because I love that table.

1263
01:35:05,737 --> 01:35:07,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You had that at some point, too.

1264
01:35:07,598 --> 01:35:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.

1265
01:35:07,939 --> 01:35:09,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have the new one.

1266
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:09,920
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jersey Jack.

1267
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:10,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right.

1268
01:35:10,321 --> 01:35:11,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Jersey Jack did one.

1269
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:11,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1270
01:35:11,842 --> 01:35:12,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Elton John.

1271
01:35:13,806 --> 01:35:14,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the Super Mario Mushroom Kingdom

1272
01:35:35,925 --> 01:35:38,847
[SPEAKER_01]: The little child-sized Gotleb one.

1273
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:40,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still want one.

1274
01:35:40,608 --> 01:35:43,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I told Dan I want one because it's like my height.

1275
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:44,791
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the height of a hobbit.

1276
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:50,294
[SPEAKER_05]: You sent me promo for the ABBA table, too, which apparently is a huge ABBA banner.

1277
01:35:50,294 --> 01:35:51,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they didn't have the table.

1278
01:35:51,235 --> 01:35:51,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not done yet.

1279
01:35:51,975 --> 01:35:54,697
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it's for sale, that huge ass banner.

1280
01:35:54,697 --> 01:35:57,239
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would take like an entire wall.

1281
01:35:57,239 --> 01:36:00,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have some pretty I'll send you a picture of it.

1282
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:00,861
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um.

1283
01:36:01,587 --> 01:36:12,074
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they they actually had the remastered Funhaus, which I will never own another one of those in my life because of that stupid head.

1284
01:36:12,074 --> 01:36:16,137
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a giant like symbol monkey.

1285
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,058
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm talking about?

1286
01:36:17,058 --> 01:36:17,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1287
01:36:17,818 --> 01:36:18,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1288
01:36:18,459 --> 01:36:19,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Glowing red eyes.

1289
01:36:19,699 --> 01:36:22,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And he nearly I was going around the corner and I'd forgotten about it.

1290
01:36:22,601 --> 01:36:26,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And I nearly get bapped in the head by a symbol by an evil giant monkey.

1291
01:36:26,104 --> 01:36:26,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Um.

1292
01:36:30,245 --> 01:36:35,827
[SPEAKER_01]: EnoBobby, I might suggest that Dan should consider getting Abba and storing Abba's dining room.

1293
01:36:35,827 --> 01:36:37,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an expensive storage.

1294
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the thought, but we do stuff like that, though.

1295
01:36:40,409 --> 01:36:41,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big, big thing.

1296
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:43,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, hey, I got to move some stuff.

1297
01:36:43,451 --> 01:36:48,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I keep a couple of pins at your place?

1298
01:36:48,293 --> 01:36:50,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I really I played a lot of stuff like.

1299
01:36:52,358 --> 01:36:56,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got to take a little time to have a few rounds on Tommy.

1300
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:03,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the last few times I've tried to play one, it's been out of order, or there's been lines, or something.

1301
01:37:03,464 --> 01:37:08,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, really like how Tommy plays.

1302
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:09,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'll play the Black Rose.

1303
01:37:09,728 --> 01:37:18,332
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as things, the big draw-in was the Funhouse... Oh, they had Queen?

1304
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:18,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play Queen.

1305
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:25,669
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did play Alien, which has been out for a little bit, but that table is so well done, it's so good.

1306
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:32,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big draw-ins were, of course, the tournament.

1307
01:37:32,831 --> 01:37:36,572
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the semi-finals, and then the finals were today.

1308
01:37:36,572 --> 01:37:40,693
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was the women's tournament last night, which I didn't go to.

1309
01:37:40,693 --> 01:37:49,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting outside in the camping area talking about pinball and who knows what else with some of the other regulars.

1310
01:37:49,255 --> 01:37:51,256
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a free tiki bar.

1311
01:37:53,526 --> 01:38:02,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I, however, I brought my own Guinness because apparently everybody just drinks IPAs and I don't know what's wrong with them.

1312
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:06,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it was just like a really a really good time.

1313
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:07,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.

1314
01:38:07,652 --> 01:38:12,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one this this year, I spent more time socializing, which is not normally my thing.

1315
01:38:12,755 --> 01:38:13,635
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's good, though.

1316
01:38:14,434 --> 01:38:28,772
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to play what I wanted to play and I made some friends and I got to, you know, I sort of cross-promoted a little bit to get more folks onto the Elk Grove Pinball Twitch.

1317
01:38:28,772 --> 01:38:30,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.

1318
01:38:30,694 --> 01:38:31,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will...

1319
01:38:33,127 --> 01:38:40,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Give a shout out if no one minds, but Elgrove Pinball has really been working with a lot of the other pinball groups in the area, too.

1320
01:38:40,271 --> 01:38:42,312
[SPEAKER_01]: They broadcast the League Nights.

1321
01:38:42,312 --> 01:38:45,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be at League Night on Thursday this week.

1322
01:38:45,233 --> 01:38:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.

1323
01:38:46,794 --> 01:38:49,015
[SPEAKER_01]: But just a bunch of really, really good folks.

1324
01:38:49,015 --> 01:39:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and they put a lot of effort into putting on the Golden State Pinball Festival every year and also work with a pentagogo that happens in Dixon that I don't go to because of corn pollen.

1325
01:39:03,487 --> 01:39:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just a really, really great group of people, really.

1326
01:39:06,969 --> 01:39:18,756
[SPEAKER_01]: You get people all over the gamut of, you know, politics and religion and this, that, and the other, but the one thing they all come together over is pinball.

1327
01:39:18,756 --> 01:39:27,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that something like that is great, that we need to remember what we have in common with people and not so much what makes us different.

1328
01:39:27,321 --> 01:39:31,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what makes us different makes us diverse, but, you know,

1329
01:39:32,082 --> 01:39:45,604
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking at, like, a lot of people do us versus them and generalize about all the sides, much like they're doing with current events overseas.

1330
01:39:45,604 --> 01:39:50,745
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to take a moment and stop and think these are people.

1331
01:39:50,745 --> 01:39:53,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember that you're dealing with people.

1332
01:39:53,766 --> 01:40:01,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And find... If you're gonna reach somebody, the best way to do it is with an open, respectful discourse.

1333
01:40:03,054 --> 01:40:10,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very much reminded of the humanity of people during all of this.

1334
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:11,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was kind.

1335
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:17,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone had, you know, would offer a seat around, you know, the little propane fire.

1336
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:21,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was that that really struck me about just how strong the community here is.

1337
01:40:21,954 --> 01:40:22,494
[SPEAKER_05]: DragonCon 2019

1338
01:40:55,938 --> 01:40:58,059
[SPEAKER_05]: DragonCon is the city of DragonCon.

1339
01:40:58,059 --> 01:41:01,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not anything else playing into that.

1340
01:41:01,442 --> 01:41:07,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Conventions are their own little subculture.

1341
01:41:07,488 --> 01:41:11,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Ranma would have a lot to say on this topic, with as many as he goes to.

1342
01:41:11,371 --> 01:41:13,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in Parsippany, New Jersey.

1343
01:41:17,472 --> 01:41:23,075
[SPEAKER_01]: has its own little community around it, the regulars, the new folks, and how people fit into it.

1344
01:41:23,075 --> 01:41:27,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, TwitchCon certainly feels a lot different than going to Anime Expo back in the day.

1345
01:41:27,857 --> 01:41:31,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Fanime felt different than Anime Expo.

1346
01:41:31,578 --> 01:41:36,901
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like its own little microcosm of a community.

1347
01:41:36,901 --> 01:41:37,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1348
01:41:37,701 --> 01:41:44,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And with its own social rules and its own language sometimes, and it's really beautiful to watch, but

1349
01:41:44,887 --> 01:41:48,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Ranma, I would love to make that a VOG roundtable.

1350
01:41:48,449 --> 01:41:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the idea of that series coming back.

1351
01:41:51,211 --> 01:41:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just it's just the thought of.

1352
01:41:55,133 --> 01:42:04,978
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no matter like where on the spectrum people are, they've come together for this one thing just to have joy.

1353
01:42:04,978 --> 01:42:12,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be full of joy and bring each other joy and to enjoy each other's company, enjoying the thing that brings them joy.

1354
01:42:12,843 --> 01:42:14,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have enough of that, you know?

1355
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:30,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the internet used to make me really happy until, you know, the echo chamber got so loud and so, you know, lots of, you know, data breaches and you name it and AI and bullshit.

1356
01:42:33,093 --> 01:42:35,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to follow up to- I miss those communities.

1357
01:42:35,374 --> 01:42:38,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to follow up to DJ Ranma's comment saying possible VOG roundtable.

1358
01:42:38,215 --> 01:42:45,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I wonder if they're still looking for DragonCon roundtables because they've been doing stuff every week leading up to DragonCon.

1359
01:42:45,178 --> 01:42:48,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be a fun way to get you kids involved with that a little bit to some extent.

1360
01:42:48,699 --> 01:42:49,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So- If they find me out.

1361
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:54,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, it's virtual virtual roundtables leading up to the actual event.

1362
01:42:54,045 --> 01:42:55,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to find me out.

1363
01:42:55,286 --> 01:42:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm famous.

1364
01:42:56,387 --> 01:42:58,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

1365
01:42:58,450 --> 01:42:59,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1422
01:47:33,503 --> 01:47:44,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before we do that, I do also want to mention that for anyone who was following it, um, the group that was doing, uh, drag her, the drag queen fighting game.

1423
01:47:44,169 --> 01:47:46,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they don't have the funding.

1424
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:49,512
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the ability to finish the game.

1425
01:47:49,512 --> 01:47:56,795

01:48:01,248 --> 01:48:02,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them some love and support.

1430
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:03,752
[SPEAKER_01]: They put a lot of heart into this game.

1431
01:48:03,752 --> 01:48:07,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so coming out though in the UK.

1432
01:48:09,054 --> 01:48:13,577
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 21st, for PlayStation and Xbox, we have System Shock.

1433
01:48:13,577 --> 01:48:18,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And for PlayStation and Switch, we have, uh, Iodine Chronicles, Hundred Heroes.

1434
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:25,063
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 23rd, we have, uh, for Switch, we have Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door.

1435
01:48:25,063 --> 01:48:32,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for, on the 24th for PlayStation and Xbox, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which I was playing like, what, six years ago?

1436
01:48:32,848 --> 01:48:35,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anyway.

1437
01:48:35,209 --> 01:48:38,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also on PlayStation, we have Madison VR.

1438
01:48:41,371 --> 01:48:42,452
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1439
01:48:42,452 --> 01:48:43,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we will move on.

1440
01:48:43,473 --> 01:48:45,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We have just a couple more stories for you.

1441
01:48:45,115 --> 01:48:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll get to our listener roundtable emails and all that good stuff.

1442
01:48:48,278 --> 01:48:50,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a call or two maybe, maybe.

1443
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:50,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1444
01:48:50,981 --> 01:48:54,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to these first last stories.

1445
01:48:54,604 --> 01:48:54,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1446
01:48:56,378 --> 01:49:01,242
[SPEAKER_04]: The petition in the UK has reached 10,000 signatures, which requires a government response.

1447
01:49:13,442 --> 01:49:24,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, they received a response from the government saying, you know, essentially the case was that those games selling must comply with UK consumer law.

1448
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: They must provide clear information and continue or allow continued access to the games that are sold on the understanding it will remain playable indefinitely.

1449
01:49:31,614 --> 01:49:32,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That's of course,

1450
01:49:32,635 --> 01:49:34,956
[SPEAKER_04]: what they were asserting with the campaign.

1451
01:49:34,956 --> 01:49:47,601
[SPEAKER_04]: The government response is consumers should be aware that there is no requirement in UK law compelling software companies to provide and providers to support older versions of their operating system software or connected products.

1452
01:49:47,601 --> 01:49:57,085
[SPEAKER_04]: There may be occasions where companies make a commercial decision based on high running costs of maintaining older servers for video games that have declining user bases.

1453
01:49:57,085 --> 01:50:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, not necessarily the response that they were waiting to see,

1454
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:02,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's kind of that makes sense.

1455
01:50:02,748 --> 01:50:03,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1456
01:50:03,049 --> 01:50:05,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Existing laws don't really cover that.

1457
01:50:05,911 --> 01:50:09,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they're trying to do is get laws passed to cover that.

1458
01:50:09,173 --> 01:50:21,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now the next step is if the petition can hit 100,000 signatures, then that'll be enough for it to be subject to a parliamentary debate.

1459
01:50:21,582 --> 01:50:25,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be brought to the floor to be debated, I guess.

1460
01:50:25,525 --> 01:50:27,847
[SPEAKER_05]: They would actually have to debate it on the floor.

1461
01:50:27,847 --> 01:50:28,848
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

1462
01:50:28,848 --> 01:50:29,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1463
01:50:30,462 --> 01:50:37,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, but as of right now, not surprised that there are no laws that protect consumers in that way.

1464
01:50:37,505 --> 01:50:38,886
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1465
01:50:38,886 --> 01:50:41,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe there should be.

1466
01:50:41,547 --> 01:50:43,268
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're trying to do.

1467
01:50:43,268 --> 01:50:52,232
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole situation is just, you know, it's just this peril of living in this online and connected world and all this other stuff.

1468
01:50:52,232 --> 01:50:55,214
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, we've talked about this to death.

1469
01:50:55,214 --> 01:50:55,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So

1470
01:50:56,007 --> 01:50:59,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I mean, we talked to all these different companies looking to make live service games.

1471
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:01,892
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is going to happen to all those games?

1472
01:51:01,892 --> 01:51:11,061
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get shut down like it's going to be horrible for video game conservation and stuff.

1473
01:51:11,061 --> 01:51:16,186
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says it tickles me that they still wear wigs in the UK Supreme Court.

1474
01:51:16,186 --> 01:51:17,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1475
01:51:17,006 --> 01:51:21,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see a bunch of men in wigs argue about this.

1476
01:51:21,711 --> 01:51:21,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1477
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what, a lot of our congressmen are also wearing wigs, they just call them toupees.

1478
01:51:27,411 --> 01:51:37,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on though, we have talked about the battle pass and all that issue to death, so let's talk about death and other means.

1479
01:51:37,695 --> 01:51:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about dead by daylight, which I saved this for last on purpose, thinking that DarkSakura might make it in time.

1480
01:51:45,078 --> 01:51:53,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And you already mentioned last week on the show, you talked about that Dungeons and Dragons was being teased for a collaboration with Dead by Daylight.

1481
01:51:53,985 --> 01:52:02,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did find out this week that yes, Dungeons and Dragons is coming to Dead by Daylight and we'll be getting the new killer Vecna will be coming to the game.

1482
01:52:04,822 --> 01:52:06,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Memories Around Vecna

1483
01:52:22,921 --> 01:52:26,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's little and bitch combined into one word, the lich.

1484
01:52:26,185 --> 01:52:33,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I will say from watching the Oh, and there is a new survivor as well, who is a literal elf.

1485
01:52:33,132 --> 01:52:33,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Two survivors.

1486
01:52:33,773 --> 01:52:35,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, it's one.

1487
01:52:35,054 --> 01:52:36,156
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a human.

1488
01:52:36,156 --> 01:52:38,358
[SPEAKER_01]: No, one's a human bard and the other is an elven bard.

1489
01:52:38,358 --> 01:52:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's it's a legendary reskin, right?

1490
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one survivor slot.

1491
01:52:42,318 --> 01:52:43,039
[SPEAKER_05]: right?

1492
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:44,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's no separate perks.

1493
01:52:44,381 --> 01:52:47,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's one survivor slot with legendary reskin.

1494
01:52:47,945 --> 01:52:51,910
[SPEAKER_05]: The female elf is the default and the male is a switch.

1495
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:53,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's adorable.

1496
01:52:53,652 --> 01:52:57,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And whose name I cannot recall and is not here in front of me.

1497
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:01,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the name of that survivor.

1498
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:17,105
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I was watching the public test round, what was cracking me up is that Vecna has this whole mechanism with like you have chests that are all throughout the field and you actually roll a d20 and a little d20 comes up on the screen.

1499
01:53:17,105 --> 01:53:26,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get a 20, you might get like a really fucking awesome item, which the one I saw was the whole like if you run into a locker, it will literally teleport you to another locker on the map.

1500
01:53:26,969 --> 01:53:29,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the get out of a killer chase free card.

1501
01:53:29,311 --> 01:53:31,473
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really overpowered in my opinion.

1502
01:53:31,473 --> 01:53:34,396
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, that's great for tunnelers.

1503
01:53:34,396 --> 01:53:37,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's a street as our that's it.

1504
01:53:37,018 --> 01:53:37,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1505
01:53:37,659 --> 01:53:41,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And the male is a bear Mara's.

1506
01:53:41,603 --> 01:53:51,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but if you roll a one, then the chest becomes a mimic and it will actually start eating you and make you scream, which is only going to make the list find you easier.

1507
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:52,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I

1508
01:54:13,428 --> 01:54:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Skullmommy

1509
01:54:37,774 --> 01:54:43,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when I saw in the trailer, she's sneaking in and opening the box with the hand.

1510
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:50,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, shit, I did this this in in a real D&D game before.

1511
01:54:50,748 --> 01:54:55,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you turn around and he's like, uh, sup, bitch?

1512
01:54:55,654 --> 01:54:56,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1513
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:57,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Vecna is not.

1514
01:54:58,655 --> 01:55:00,896
[SPEAKER_01]: a bad guy to be trifle with.

1515
01:55:10,675 --> 01:55:16,297
[SPEAKER_05]: a whole little talent where they play a guitar.

1516
01:55:16,297 --> 01:55:22,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And they actually like, yeah, I think it's a, it's a, another D20 mechanic if I remember right.

1517
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're playing for you on Twitch.

1518
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:27,081
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a random YouTube of somebody actually playing as Vekna.

1519
01:55:27,081 --> 01:55:29,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see what it looks like in game and like the different abilities and stuff.

1520
01:55:31,363 --> 01:55:52,437
[SPEAKER_05]: so uh but the um and you can actually see how rad this map is too it's it's and you see the beholder that was the one from the trailer and this there's one of the portals yep and this really is probably the best map i've seen behavior make for the game and this is coming off the it's the borgo yeah the um the alien map the nostromo was really good too so they're on a roll lately with this stuff

1521
01:55:53,238 --> 01:56:01,107
[SPEAKER_01]: They took the Knights map and completely retooled it for this character.

1522
01:56:01,107 --> 01:56:01,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

1523
01:56:01,908 --> 01:56:06,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do like the bright yellow and red map, I'll be honest.

1524
01:56:06,914 --> 01:56:08,236
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is cool.

1525
01:56:08,236 --> 01:56:09,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the YouTube buffering.

1526
01:56:09,777 --> 01:56:12,619
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see if I can skip ahead to a different part.

1527
01:56:12,619 --> 01:56:18,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a blender rip of the new character and her instrument.

1528
01:56:18,804 --> 01:56:20,505
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it just looks really cool.

1529
01:56:20,505 --> 01:56:25,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to check that out when it actually hits the live game.

1530
01:56:25,388 --> 01:56:34,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But because they were doing the 8th anniversary announcements, they decided they weren't going to stop there and they would announce a little further in advance too, which to be fair, they did last year.

1531
01:56:34,935 --> 01:56:35,956
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember, I didn't

1532
01:56:36,576 --> 01:56:44,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil didn't come out for the anniversary that came out later right and they teased that or that was Resident Evil part two specifically with Ada Wong and all that.

1533
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:50,843
[SPEAKER_05]: This time around, they have announced the next collaboration will be Castlevania, which

1534
01:56:52,116 --> 01:57:21,253
[SPEAKER_05]: has been rumored there's some leaks out there some pretty some DVD leakers that are getting a lot of clout right now because they called this one but Castlevania is going to be the next collaboration not the first time behavior has worked with Konami because of course Silent Hill is in the game and Cheryl probably has more reskins than anybody else because you can be Cheryl you can be Nurse Lisa you can be James which doesn't make any sense but anyway you can be Alyssa you can be the cop what's her name

1535
01:57:21,838 --> 01:57:21,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

1536
01:57:22,847 --> 01:57:26,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can be Cheryl's like 20 different characters.

1537
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:27,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Cybill Bennett.

1538
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:28,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Cybill, that's it.

1539
01:57:28,572 --> 01:57:31,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can be Pyramid Head.

1540
01:57:31,334 --> 01:57:33,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be Robby if you play Legion.

1541
01:57:33,635 --> 01:57:34,256
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1542
01:57:34,256 --> 01:57:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And Robby, not the robot.

1543
01:57:36,378 --> 01:57:37,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say Robby the robot.

1544
01:57:37,579 --> 01:57:38,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Robby the rabbit.

1545
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:39,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, is a legionary skin.

1546
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:41,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's lots of Silent Hills.

1547
01:57:41,001 --> 01:57:42,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it got its own map, too.

1548
01:57:42,302 --> 01:57:43,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Midwich map is pretty rad.

1549
01:57:43,984 --> 01:57:51,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very it's a very like definitive map because it's very it's like probably the easiest map to understand.

1550
01:57:52,310 --> 01:58:01,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So true story, on that map, if you've got survivors who don't know what the crap they're doing, you get a really quick 4K on it.

1551
01:58:01,092 --> 01:58:03,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my Clown Adept on it in five minutes.

1552
01:58:03,572 --> 01:58:04,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

1553
01:58:04,653 --> 01:58:05,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally.

1554
01:58:05,273 --> 01:58:07,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Midwich is a square donut map.

1555
01:58:07,393 --> 01:58:07,993
[SPEAKER_05]: That is all it is.

1556
01:58:07,993 --> 01:58:08,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

1557
01:58:08,253 --> 01:58:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a square donut map with staircases on both sides.

1558
01:58:12,414 --> 01:58:13,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And an Easter egg.

1559
01:58:13,475 --> 01:58:14,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1560
01:58:14,775 --> 01:58:14,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1561
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:22,847
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an easter egg too, the whole summoning circle thing, if you do the gens in a certain order, right?

1562
01:58:22,847 --> 01:58:33,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, so you have to do, and you don't always get both of these generators, so you have to do, you can do the bottom ones, that's fine, but upstairs you have to do the chem lab first.

1563
01:58:34,352 --> 01:58:36,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to do the music room.

1564
01:58:36,373 --> 01:58:39,815
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do the chem lab, you'll hear the bell tower go off.

1565
01:58:39,815 --> 01:58:43,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you do the same for the music room.

1566
01:58:43,777 --> 01:58:50,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do both of that, and you hear both of the chimes, then at the end game collapse, so when the gates are open,

1567
01:58:52,282 --> 01:59:01,967
[SPEAKER_01]: The clock tower opens and usually there's an item of rare quality, although I've gotten flashlights every last time I've gotten it done.

1568
01:59:01,967 --> 01:59:06,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the last few times I've gotten it done, my game's been glitched and I don't see the doors open.

1569
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:10,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see my friends walking through the door, going into the clock tower and getting whatever they want.

1570
01:59:11,294 --> 01:59:12,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really cool.

1571
01:59:12,034 --> 01:59:13,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a neat effect.

1572
01:59:13,435 --> 01:59:17,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it has the sign of Metatron in it, too.

1573
01:59:17,177 --> 01:59:21,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously, behaviors done a great job with Konami previously.

1574
01:59:21,478 --> 01:59:23,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So Castlevania in that regard does make sense.

1575
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:26,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, I'm sure a lot of people are going to house Castlevania to work in Dead by Daylight.

1576
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:29,842
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's about fucking time we had a vampire character in the game.

1577
01:59:29,842 --> 01:59:32,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's obvious Dracula's got to be the killer.

1578
01:59:32,823 --> 01:59:34,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be specifically the the

1579
01:59:35,003 --> 01:59:38,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't see a Belmont being a survivor like that.

1580
01:59:38,125 --> 01:59:39,346
[SPEAKER_05]: What if we get Maria?

1581
01:59:45,911 --> 01:59:47,412
[SPEAKER_05]: or is it just a licensed killer?

1582
01:59:47,412 --> 01:59:52,616
[SPEAKER_01]: According to some of the people I follow, the rumor is that it's going to be with the December release.

1583
01:59:52,616 --> 01:59:53,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1584
01:59:53,557 --> 01:59:59,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're guessing that that's the next big licensed one with both killer and survivor.

1585
01:59:59,241 --> 02:00:01,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the thought is going for right now.

1586
02:00:01,603 --> 02:00:09,368
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the other reason why we have Vecna for D&D is they were going to get a vampire.

1587
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:10,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard about that.

1588
02:00:10,529 --> 02:00:13,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were doing Count something was supposed to be the D&D character.

1589
02:00:13,852 --> 02:00:14,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1590
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:16,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my brain no work.

1591
02:00:16,462 --> 02:00:21,365
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, that they because Castlevania, they got the deal for it.

1592
02:00:21,365 --> 02:00:22,767
[SPEAKER_01]: They went with Vecna instead.

1593
02:00:22,767 --> 02:00:23,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1594
02:00:23,527 --> 02:00:28,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that all of those people who were saying that Stranger Things Vecna was coming in were kind of like minuscule.

1595
02:00:28,911 --> 02:00:30,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

1596
02:00:30,092 --> 02:00:31,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there is an interview.

1597
02:00:31,994 --> 02:00:41,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a hoax, but yeah, I believe there's an interview out there with somebody from Behavior that said this doesn't rule out Stranger Things Vecna, but they just have nothing else to announce at this time.

1598
02:00:41,561 --> 02:00:42,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are.

1599
02:00:42,002 --> 02:00:43,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Would they do like a reskin?

1600
02:00:44,787 --> 02:00:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see how they could with the deal between Hasbro and the deal with Netflix.

1601
02:00:53,591 --> 02:00:55,532
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have to call the killer something else.

1602
02:00:55,532 --> 02:01:03,796
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have to have the lich and they would have to have the whatever would make sense, the imagination or I don't know what they would call it.

1603
02:01:03,796 --> 02:01:07,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like experiment, whatever.

1604
02:01:07,178 --> 02:01:09,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the experiment or something that might be.

1605
02:01:09,739 --> 02:01:11,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So they would have to like have it.

1606
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Chucky is the good guy.

1607
02:01:13,581 --> 02:01:13,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1608
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:18,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but anyway, I think Dead by Daylight's in a pretty good place right now.

1609
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:23,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, since you're here, DarkSakura, before we get to the listener roundtable, I kind of want to ask you, what do you think of the Chaos Shuffle event going on right now?

1610
02:01:23,028 --> 02:01:23,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think it's great.

1611
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:24,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to play anything.

1612
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:25,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not long enough.

1613
02:01:25,611 --> 02:01:27,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right, because it's only been this weekend.

1614
02:01:27,032 --> 02:01:28,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not long enough.

1615
02:01:28,493 --> 02:01:29,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

1616
02:01:29,294 --> 02:01:30,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know why I think it's great?

1617
02:01:30,495 --> 02:01:32,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Six days.

1618
02:01:32,356 --> 02:01:33,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1619
02:01:33,677 --> 02:01:36,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Because killers and survivors cannot bring sweaty builds.

1620
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:38,742
[SPEAKER_05]: VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1621
02:01:46,175 --> 02:01:46,916
[SPEAKER_05]: VOG Network, DJ Ranma

1622
02:02:11,212 --> 02:02:13,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna log in tonight, but I'm not streaming.

1623
02:02:13,232 --> 02:02:15,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just logging in to get my blood points.

1624
02:02:15,613 --> 02:02:23,475
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm gonna spend a little bit of... I mean, if it's still going on Tuesday, then I'll be dedicating my survivor time to that.

1625
02:02:23,475 --> 02:02:33,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So... But it's... It's... I think that they're really trying to keep people playing the game who have gotten burnt out.

1626
02:02:33,877 --> 02:02:34,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1627
02:02:34,417 --> 02:02:34,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

1628
02:02:34,997 --> 02:02:36,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.

1629
02:02:36,197 --> 02:02:40,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And just when I think I might take a step back from it, I get pulled right back in.

1630
02:02:40,836 --> 02:02:42,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and now this D&D thing is huge.

1631
02:02:42,858 --> 02:02:44,780
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a real... The D&D thing is really big for me.

1632
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:48,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be as good as the Resident Evil stuff was for the game, I think.

1633
02:02:48,424 --> 02:02:49,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1634
02:02:49,265 --> 02:02:56,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And... But I was still a little bit on the fence until I saw the trailer and saw her going for the hand.

1635
02:02:56,132 --> 02:02:56,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1636
02:02:56,933 --> 02:03:02,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was exactly the same feeling I had playing that campaign for the first time.

1637
02:03:02,559 --> 02:03:03,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Good times.

1638
02:03:04,386 --> 02:03:04,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1639
02:03:04,867 --> 02:03:05,748
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1640
02:03:05,748 --> 02:03:07,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's get to the listener roundtable.

1641
02:03:07,991 --> 02:03:13,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week we invite your phone calls over on our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1642
02:03:13,918 --> 02:03:16,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a green room channel available if you want to give us a call.

1643
02:03:16,301 --> 02:03:22,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that's vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room, but I would encourage you to just join our discord channel and talk to us throughout the week.

1644
02:03:23,489 --> 02:03:30,172
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of stories that we end up doing on the show are suggested by you all in our chat room over at Orange Lounge Radio, which is always a delight to see.

1645
02:03:30,172 --> 02:03:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, join us in our Discord server and talk to us throughout the week.

1646
02:03:33,153 --> 02:03:34,294
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a mailbag.

1647
02:03:34,294 --> 02:03:36,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1648
02:03:36,955 --> 02:03:38,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have at least one.

1649
02:03:38,015 --> 02:03:40,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there might be two, but at least one.

1650
02:03:40,636 --> 02:03:41,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm checking.

1651
02:03:41,537 --> 02:03:43,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to get to those here in just a moment.

1652
02:03:43,678 --> 02:03:48,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I will jump quickly to Loki for a last minute story if we happen to have one before we do eels.

1653
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:49,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any.

1654
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, unfortunately, well, guess what?

1655
02:03:51,201 --> 02:03:53,502
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a call in the green room so we can get to that first.

1656
02:03:53,502 --> 02:03:54,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's do it.

1657
02:03:54,082 --> 02:03:55,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get right into it.

1658
02:03:55,203 --> 02:03:55,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1659
02:03:55,683 --> 02:03:56,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You are on Orange Launch Radio.

1660
02:03:56,803 --> 02:03:58,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1661
02:03:58,424 --> 02:04:00,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi, everybody.

1662
02:04:00,525 --> 02:04:01,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one and only Ranma.

1663
02:04:01,826 --> 02:04:02,826
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing tonight?

1664
02:04:02,826 --> 02:04:03,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I am doing fabulous.

1665
02:04:03,926 --> 02:04:07,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the shirt you're wearing because I happen to have the same one.

1666
02:04:07,588 --> 02:04:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1667
02:04:08,449 --> 02:04:09,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had to.

1668
02:04:09,349 --> 02:04:10,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had to.

1669
02:04:10,409 --> 02:04:10,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1670
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

1671
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Not not currently, but sometimes.

1672
02:04:14,651 --> 02:04:15,612
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1673
02:04:15,612 --> 02:04:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

1674
02:04:17,196 --> 02:04:24,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you just have to mention con culture, and- Oh, I thought this might be it.

1675
02:04:24,198 --> 02:04:34,180
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 plus years of drunken and sober camaraderie, over 250 conventions- How many cons do you go to in a year?

1676
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,620
[SPEAKER_02]: At least 15.

1677
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:36,340
[SPEAKER_02]: At least 15.

1678
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:37,340
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1679
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,121
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1680
02:04:38,121 --> 02:04:38,721
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1681
02:04:38,721 --> 02:04:44,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say at least four or five, because more than half of them are local.

1682
02:04:46,176 --> 02:05:09,235
[SPEAKER_02]: uh okay okay yeah if you go back to like late 90s early 2000s 2010s cons were scattered all over con chairs would actually work with each other on dates so that they wouldn't overlap each other now it's like oh i'm having my con this weekend well screw you i'm having my con this weekend and the other person's like well we're like

1683
02:05:09,995 --> 02:05:12,499
[SPEAKER_02]: 5-6 hours away from y'all so we're doing it this weekend.

1684
02:05:12,499 --> 02:05:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So many.

1685
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:19,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because of the pandemic, the convention bubble legitimately burst.

1686
02:05:19,248 --> 02:05:21,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1687
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:24,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the great idea was, let's do virtual conventions.

1688
02:05:24,935 --> 02:05:26,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was all about that.

1689
02:05:26,949 --> 02:05:42,521
[SPEAKER_02]: but that one 4th of July weekend where I had Twitch up on the Xbox for a convention, Twitch up on one laptop for another convention, and then Twitch up on this desk for another convention, trying to pay attention to all of it, and I went and said,

1690
02:05:44,019 --> 02:05:50,266
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bullshit and I just cut it all off and just decided to play video games only tuned in for certain panels and that was it.

1691
02:06:01,778 --> 02:06:04,380
[SPEAKER_05]: me personally, I hated the I hated it.

1692
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:09,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I I'm fine with it with things that are related to my day job and the professional stuff, because I don't know.

1693
02:06:09,623 --> 02:06:11,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very different vibe.

1694
02:06:11,945 --> 02:06:15,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like I can do virtual conventions, my day job, and I've done stuff like that.

1695
02:06:15,227 --> 02:06:25,634
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's very different from like the personal hanging out that, you know, there's a certain culture of randomness that I don't need for my work conventions that I do need for my personal personal conventions.

1696
02:06:25,634 --> 02:06:27,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's for me.

1697
02:06:27,255 --> 02:06:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't getting that from the virtual thing.

1698
02:06:28,776 --> 02:06:30,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why it happened.

1699
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:31,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an era of our lives.

1700
02:06:32,499 --> 02:06:32,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Nugget

1701
02:06:53,359 --> 02:07:05,185
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I don't really mind it per se because there are still some conventions that still do the whole virtual effect, but it's more like, oh, we'll stream certain panels and events.

1702
02:07:05,185 --> 02:07:10,047
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay 10 bucks and you have access to it for this year and prior years.

1703
02:07:10,047 --> 02:07:10,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with that.

1704
02:07:10,947 --> 02:07:11,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You have that option.

1705
02:07:12,428 --> 02:07:13,049
[SPEAKER_05]: DragonCon DC TV

1706
02:07:33,288 --> 02:07:35,769
[SPEAKER_01]: This let them be a part of the fandoms they love.

1707
02:07:52,139 --> 02:07:53,739
[SPEAKER_02]: is the cosplay aspect.

1708
02:07:53,739 --> 02:08:04,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I record a lot of cosplay masquerades, so basically you're on stage with your props, you have a little minute, about a time to do what you gotta do.

1709
02:08:04,122 --> 02:08:09,664
[SPEAKER_02]: In the virtual sense, they're basically told, well, here's your time.

1710
02:08:11,138 --> 02:08:12,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Have at it.

1711
02:08:12,219 --> 02:08:27,087
[SPEAKER_02]: You have cosplayers doing their skits in backyards, parks, in front of museums, all over just to get it like as close to the anime that they're doing as possible and throwing in all these special effects.

1712
02:08:27,087 --> 02:08:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one of the best things I've seen come out of it.

1713
02:08:30,008 --> 02:08:33,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Fully animated backgrounds on a green screen that they've done from scratch.

1714
02:08:33,971 --> 02:08:34,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1715
02:08:35,339 --> 02:08:48,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, there are some conventions now where you can still do your skit on the stage, you have the video playing in the background, some cons, the background's a giant backdrop, others not so much, but you can make it work, you know?

1716
02:08:48,988 --> 02:08:55,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we might've got a little off track to what you were originally called, which is fine, but OLR, Tangents, what?

1717
02:08:55,092 --> 02:08:59,415
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you really want to talk about tonight, DarkSakura?

1718
02:08:59,415 --> 02:09:03,918
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the culture, the convention culture is like, you will go to a con,

1719
02:09:04,716 --> 02:09:21,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Not knowing anybody after three days, you're gonna walk out with probably a couple of hundred of photos, half of them are selfies, new social media contacts, and then you're chatting with them the next week over random and awesome stuff.

1720
02:09:21,349 --> 02:09:28,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the fact that one of my favorite things about the con culture is late Friday nights and late Saturday nights.

1721
02:09:28,935 --> 02:09:32,018
[SPEAKER_02]: What we used to do was hang out in front of

1722
02:09:32,418 --> 02:10:00,387
[SPEAKER_02]: the hotel not the lobby but in the hotel you find con goers there's all different types of conversations next thing you know someone's like you here have a drink it's this and this and you're just having a good time yes i understand you know you shouldn't take a drink from somebody that you don't know but in that con culture they're not gonna start doing with the uh with the religious protesters though at anime expo i miss that in full costume

1723
02:10:01,392 --> 02:10:03,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jamie, you'd like this.

1724
02:10:03,934 --> 02:10:11,240
[SPEAKER_02]: If it can be found, every year at ZankiCon, there's always that one person that has the religious guy.

1725
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:18,006
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a picture of me cosplaying Gardebel, standing right next to him, giving the seal of approval or something like that.

1726
02:10:18,006 --> 02:10:19,087
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture.

1727
02:10:19,087 --> 02:10:21,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And he thinks I'm actually on his side.

1728
02:10:21,569 --> 02:10:21,709
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1729
02:10:24,537 --> 02:10:25,318
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

1730
02:10:25,318 --> 02:10:39,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I you know, it's when DarkSakura was talking about that, you know, what she was talking about the being a little more extroverted, I guess this year in the connections she was making, you know, it might surprise you all, but the first couple Dragon Cons I went to, I was also very insulated because I didn't hardly know anybody.

1731
02:10:39,988 --> 02:10:47,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I have very vivid memories of going to my first LGBT kind of party at Dragon Con, really hoping to meet people.

1732
02:10:47,213 --> 02:10:48,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had I had one.

1733
02:10:50,495 --> 02:10:58,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless this drag queen who came up and talked to me because she saw that I was kind of like lonely and she actually came up and talked to me, asked who I was and what I was about.

1734
02:10:58,058 --> 02:11:03,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, she doesn't know like, yeah, I have this like long running podcast about video games, all this stuff.

1735
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:05,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was a and I wish I remembered her name.

1736
02:11:05,221 --> 02:11:05,701
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

1737
02:11:06,041 --> 02:11:09,244
[SPEAKER_05]: But she was a Star Trek themed drag queen, classic Star Trek.

1738
02:11:09,244 --> 02:11:11,646
[SPEAKER_05]: She only did dress ups from classic Star Trek.

1739
02:11:11,646 --> 02:11:12,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And I won't forget that.

1740
02:11:12,466 --> 02:11:14,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I forgot her name, which I guess isn't great.

1741
02:11:14,108 --> 02:11:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But I won't forget that gesture, which I thought was like really awesome.

1742
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:20,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Because yeah, it took it took me a little while to find my footing socially, as well.

1743
02:11:20,873 --> 02:11:21,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know,

1744
02:11:23,974 --> 02:11:25,936
[SPEAKER_05]: But now and now I've got my own crowd.

1745
02:11:25,936 --> 02:11:31,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know even even Bobby's like, wow, Rob's just like got his own group, the Dragon Con.

1746
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:36,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, sometimes we intermix, you know, and I've borrowed I've borrowed one of his friends over the years, too.

1747
02:11:36,764 --> 02:11:41,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, you know, it's just like her and her and I were hanging out a lot with because it was Alan's first year.

1748
02:11:41,768 --> 02:11:44,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bobby has another friend.

1749
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:47,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And last year, especially, we just like we pretty much kidnapped her for the entire weekend.

1750
02:11:47,553 --> 02:11:48,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Heather Wood?

1751
02:11:48,694 --> 02:11:49,735
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1752
02:11:49,735 --> 02:11:50,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Heather Wood?

1753
02:11:50,756 --> 02:11:52,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Was she out of New York?

1754
02:11:52,177 --> 02:11:52,357
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1755
02:11:53,658 --> 02:11:55,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Rob, to go back to the LGBT meetup, I have a little story.

1756
02:11:55,539 --> 02:11:57,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a con kid that

1757
02:12:18,707 --> 02:12:22,248
[SPEAKER_02]: My real kid but someone I adopted along the way, you know.

1758
02:12:22,248 --> 02:12:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So she comes with us to conventions and so forth and she's shy and quiet but she loves anime and cosplay and through deducting and reasoning I discovered she's queer.

1759
02:12:35,392 --> 02:12:36,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, you know what?

1760
02:12:37,108 --> 02:12:39,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't introduce you to all of my queer friends.

1761
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:48,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's a question that you're going to ask me that I don't have an answer to, here's a list of your gay aunts and uncles that's going to answer them for you.

1762
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:49,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Behold, gays.

1763
02:12:51,824 --> 02:12:53,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

1764
02:12:53,225 --> 02:12:59,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And I introduce her to all, and she just gets excited going to concerts.

1765
02:12:59,227 --> 02:13:05,529
[SPEAKER_02]: She knows this person, she has somebody that also she can hang out with and so forth.

1766
02:13:05,529 --> 02:13:12,352
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not around, if Mako, if Alice is not around, there's places that she can go and hang out with and so forth.

1767
02:13:12,352 --> 02:13:15,473
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing that I really enjoy about this culture.

1768
02:13:15,473 --> 02:13:19,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, for the most part, nobody gives a damn about

1769
02:13:20,686 --> 02:13:28,089
[SPEAKER_02]: In my case, you wake up still in your live-action vampire outfit under somebody's bed.

1770
02:13:28,089 --> 02:13:30,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first Mobicon.

1771
02:13:50,459 --> 02:13:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell another Dragon Con story that to kind of wrap this up, but it's it's a good one.

1772
02:13:54,744 --> 02:14:03,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how I how I met one of my closest probably Dragon Con pals, Jordan, that I see every year and hang out with for at least a little bit and him and his group and you know, I met a lot of them.

1773
02:14:03,955 --> 02:14:06,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So the funny story about Jordan is that I met Jordan, we were hanging out.

1774
02:14:06,818 --> 02:14:10,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So Exetior came to Dragon Con one year, it was the year before the

1775
02:14:10,682 --> 02:14:11,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Panini.

1776
02:14:11,783 --> 02:14:18,428
[SPEAKER_05]: He came to DragonCon before he had a kid too, which is also a reason why he hasn't been back since then, as he's being a full-time dad.

1777
02:14:18,428 --> 02:14:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: But Extro was there, and Extro knew, I think he met a group of people through Twitter, because at the time Twitter was cool.

1778
02:14:25,674 --> 02:14:37,964
[SPEAKER_05]: He met a group of people through that, and I went with him to go to these DragonCon events, and then we kind of met like a little group of like his Twitter friends and their friends, and then I, you know, we were just talking and like all hanging out, and then like

1779
02:14:38,504 --> 02:14:43,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordan was on Facebook doing so he's like, Oh, sorry, I'm doing this like online survivor thing.

1780
02:14:43,327 --> 02:14:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to check.

1781
02:14:43,927 --> 02:14:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Hold up, hold up.

1782
02:14:45,668 --> 02:14:48,209
[SPEAKER_05]: You do online like fake survivor games.

1783
02:14:48,209 --> 02:14:51,091
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, Yeah, I'm like, I play orgs too.

1784
02:14:51,091 --> 02:14:55,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And we realized, we knew each other's games that we were and like, it was one of those things.

1785
02:14:55,293 --> 02:15:00,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, wait a minute, because obviously, that's a very, like nuanced, like small circle, right?

1786
02:15:00,316 --> 02:15:03,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once it only takes that connection, right?

1787
02:15:03,278 --> 02:15:05,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we had that connection, we were like,

1788
02:15:06,019 --> 02:15:09,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's like, okay, DragonCon bestie, like, let's go, let's hang out.

1789
02:15:09,521 --> 02:15:13,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like, you and I have an understanding, we have a connection.

1790
02:15:13,303 --> 02:15:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like a thing we can talk about, like literally all night, there is so much drama in those games, which I haven't played in a long time.

1791
02:15:20,027 --> 02:15:23,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably won't again, just because they're a big time sink.

1792
02:15:23,409 --> 02:15:28,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's like so much drama and things you can talk about with all that.

1793
02:15:28,192 --> 02:15:28,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just it's

1794
02:15:28,872 --> 02:15:29,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was cool.

1795
02:15:29,353 --> 02:15:34,863
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like DragonCon kind of brought that together, even though we were in this other nerd circle.

1796
02:15:34,863 --> 02:15:42,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, oh, when we're at the capital of nerddom once a year, like you're these nerd circles are going to come together.

1797
02:15:42,295 --> 02:15:42,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1798
02:15:45,146 --> 02:15:49,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say this real quick, then I'll go about my merry little way and let other people call in.

1799
02:15:49,867 --> 02:16:03,553
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to DragonCon, and also in regards to the wedding that I went to a couple of weekends ago that was Downton Abbey themed, my friend Shannon now met his current wife, DragonCon.

1800
02:16:03,553 --> 02:16:10,136
[SPEAKER_02]: They were longtime friends and they finally met and it just frickin' clicked for them.

1801
02:16:10,136 --> 02:16:10,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't be any happier.

1802
02:16:11,445 --> 02:16:13,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Podculture in chat says Ranma should come to DragonCon.

1803
02:16:13,849 --> 02:16:17,055
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not the first to say that.

1804
02:16:17,055 --> 02:16:17,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Again!

1805
02:16:18,419 --> 02:16:21,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Large crowds do me no good.

1806
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:25,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a miracle that I make it through Anime NYC.

1807
02:16:25,742 --> 02:16:29,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crowded, but it's so spread out with stuff.

1808
02:16:29,604 --> 02:16:31,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind it as much.

1809
02:16:31,965 --> 02:16:34,407
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what was good about TwitchCon.

1810
02:16:34,407 --> 02:16:35,407
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spread out.

1811
02:16:35,407 --> 02:16:36,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1812
02:16:36,067 --> 02:16:41,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would I would say, you know, Alan is also very he was very nervous about that.

1813
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:43,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And he still is like, this place is really fucking crowded.

1814
02:16:43,571 --> 02:16:45,452
[SPEAKER_05]: But you find your little cubbies.

1815
02:16:46,112 --> 02:16:47,593
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I don't mean people.

1816
02:16:47,593 --> 02:16:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like you find your little like, like, like ballroom.

1817
02:16:50,455 --> 02:16:52,196
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what they're calling new bears now.

1818
02:16:52,196 --> 02:16:53,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, little cubbies.

1819
02:16:53,777 --> 02:16:57,599
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you find your track room.

1820
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:00,121
[SPEAKER_05]: You find your people playing werewolf ballroom.

1821
02:17:00,121 --> 02:17:02,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You find your gaming place.

1822
02:17:02,042 --> 02:17:10,167
[SPEAKER_05]: You find that fucking three story America Mart that randomly had the DMD campaigns last year that was extremely fucking spread out and empty, but it worked.

1823
02:17:10,487 --> 02:17:24,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kind of find, because like, yeah, when you see the videos online of the Super Bowl of Cosplay, yes, you're going to see the wall-to-wall people, Marriott, because that's the fucking capital of cosplay and people want to be seen there.

1824
02:17:24,076 --> 02:17:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of DragonCon you're not seeing in those videos.

1825
02:17:27,198 --> 02:17:35,143
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little more, you know, but I, again, I'm not trying to diminish your concerns because, yeah, it's a valid concern, especially the elevator games are going to be no fun.

1826
02:17:35,703 --> 02:17:42,709
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, those of us that don't like the big crowds that survive DragonCon sort of figure out how to balance it.

1827
02:17:42,709 --> 02:17:44,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You sort of find your getaway spots, so.

1828
02:17:46,226 --> 02:17:50,749
[SPEAKER_02]: think about it, but again, I would be going in the mindset as press and coverage.

1829
02:17:50,749 --> 02:17:57,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for DragonCon, I would have to be more of an attendee to kick back, relax, and enjoy it more.

1830
02:17:57,573 --> 02:18:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've done that for a couple of conventions, and yet I still brought old Bertha with me to take pictures because I'm like, people got to check out what I saw, you know?

1831
02:18:06,619 --> 02:18:09,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Or go as an attendee or a panelist one year.

1832
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:11,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet we could get you on a panel, but

1833
02:18:12,935 --> 02:18:14,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, okay with that.

1834
02:18:14,296 --> 02:18:15,777
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another topic for another time.

1835
02:18:15,777 --> 02:18:29,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I will get your final comment here and then we'll let you go and get to the emails.

1836
02:18:29,204 --> 02:18:32,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Finding an apartment in New York City blows.

1837
02:18:32,185 --> 02:18:32,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1838
02:18:32,926 --> 02:18:42,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I know that and I'm on the fucking other coast of the country outside of San Francisco and I would say the actual process of finding an apartment in New York is worse.

1839
02:18:43,516 --> 02:18:50,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I've had people say, you should go to Jersey, and I turn and look, nobody goes to Jersey willingly.

1840
02:18:50,341 --> 02:18:51,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That person is not your friend anymore.

1841
02:18:51,862 --> 02:18:58,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are people in Jersey that say, yeah, we're not there willingly.

1842
02:18:58,026 --> 02:18:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1843
02:18:58,987 --> 02:19:00,308
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, my friend, we'll let you go.

1844
02:19:00,308 --> 02:19:00,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

1845
02:19:00,628 --> 02:19:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always good to hear from you, Rama.

1846
02:19:01,629 --> 02:19:02,690
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bye, guys.

1847
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all take care.

1848
02:19:04,191 --> 02:19:06,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Memorial Day, all that good stuff.

1849
02:19:06,652 --> 02:19:07,733
[SPEAKER_02]: My birthday's coming up.

1850
02:19:07,733 --> 02:19:10,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get lit, so I'll see you last year.

1851
02:19:10,215 --> 02:19:12,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me be the first to say, happy fucking birthday.

1852
02:19:13,442 --> 02:19:14,424
[SPEAKER_05]: E-Mail Singular

1853
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:29,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'll read it.

1854
02:19:29,271 --> 02:19:29,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

1855
02:19:29,812 --> 02:19:30,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

1856
02:19:30,292 --> 02:19:31,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let's do it.

1857
02:19:31,733 --> 02:19:33,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR.

1858
02:19:33,014 --> 02:19:37,858
[SPEAKER_01]: On the show last week, Rob mentioned that I was at Furry Weekend Atlanta, or FWA.

1859
02:19:37,858 --> 02:19:40,039
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Garth Wolfe.

1860
02:19:40,039 --> 02:19:45,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to chime in on some gaming-related activities that happened at the con, namely the game room.

1861
02:19:45,403 --> 02:19:55,311
[SPEAKER_01]: The space they had for the arcade was even larger than last year, having arcade cabinets provided by SafePoint for plenty of rhythm fighting and even train simulation game action.

1862
02:19:57,653 --> 02:20:00,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Savepoint does DragonCon too, so yeah, they're great.

1863
02:20:01,596 --> 02:20:10,061
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing of note is that all of the arcade cabinets, the one that had the largest group of people surrounding it at all times, was none other than Dance Rush Stardom.

1864
02:20:10,061 --> 02:20:19,887
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the case last year, so it seems that interest in the game has grown, despite no new versions of the game being announced, if I am recalling correctly.

1865
02:20:19,887 --> 02:20:26,511
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bet your ass I was bouncing my tail on that platform, but someone recorded me playing Pump It Up in DDR Max 2 in fursuit.

1866
02:20:26,511 --> 02:20:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Freakin' Max 2!

1867
02:20:27,531 --> 02:20:29,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so excited to play that mix once again.

1868
02:20:30,573 --> 02:20:38,395
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the arcade area, they had a dedicated space for speedrunning a game called Fastest Furs.

1869
02:20:38,395 --> 02:20:54,619
[SPEAKER_01]: From Sonic Adventure DX to Super Mario RPG, they ran through games over the course of two days to raise $12,275 for their charity, Lost and Found Youth, who have the goal of finding safety and shelter for Atlanta's LGBT homeless youth.

1870
02:20:55,379 --> 02:21:03,289
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a small part of what happens at FWA in addition to the crazy dances, guest performances, mystery skulls, mystery skulls!

1871
02:21:03,289 --> 02:21:03,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.

1872
02:21:05,171 --> 02:21:06,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Mystery Skulls.

1873
02:21:06,892 --> 02:21:11,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Fursuiting and cosplay, beer and mead tastings, room parties, and general confuckery.

1874
02:21:11,916 --> 02:21:14,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be back in 2025 for sure.

1875
02:21:14,217 --> 02:21:14,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Love y'all.

1876
02:21:14,637 --> 02:21:15,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Garth Wolfe.

1877
02:21:35,671 --> 02:21:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to Atlanta enough as it I know everybody always jokes.

1878
02:21:37,973 --> 02:21:38,994
[SPEAKER_05]: She's just moved to Atlanta.

1879
02:21:38,994 --> 02:21:39,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it clear.

1880
02:21:39,574 --> 02:21:40,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not moving to Atlanta.

1881
02:21:40,635 --> 02:21:45,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do that because of the if you knew what I did for a living, you'd be like, Oh, you have to be in California.

1882
02:21:45,378 --> 02:21:47,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is not going to happen.

1883
02:21:47,740 --> 02:21:49,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And same thing with my husband.

1884
02:21:49,121 --> 02:21:57,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So but I love to visit but it's like I would love to go to FWA if it wasn't like another reason to go to Atlanta when I have two other cons.

1885
02:21:58,147 --> 02:22:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Like DragonCon, and hopefully again, not this year, but maybe another year, Southern Pride Gaming Expo.

1886
02:22:03,028 --> 02:22:08,829
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would love to go to, I'd love to, I'm not, I don't consider myself part of the furry community, but I know they're chill as fuck.

1887
02:22:08,829 --> 02:22:12,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I am all about just a chill as fuck weekend with chill as fuck people.

1888
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:15,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what it sounds like FWA is really turning into.

1889
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:16,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sounds great.

1890
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:17,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby mentioned he went there.

1891
02:22:17,431 --> 02:22:22,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Bobby's not in that community, but Bobby's like, but there's speedrunning people that intersect there.

1892
02:22:22,251 --> 02:22:23,772
[SPEAKER_05]: So he went down to meet the speedrunning people.

1893
02:22:23,772 --> 02:22:25,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds like he had a great time.

1894
02:22:26,152 --> 02:22:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And he translated to DragonCon speak your email for me by saying that the game room was the Hilton Galleria rooms, but with the partitions down, the way it used to be before all the tracks were down there, including... So that same game room, Garth, or anybody that was at FWA,

1895
02:22:43,747 --> 02:23:08,103
[SPEAKER_05]: is where the podcasting room at DragonCon is but it's partitioned so they actually make like eight rooms down there where the anime track is and the Star Trek track is but that used to be back in the day where tabletop gaming was and the big pods that used to be the mech thing that was at Dave and Buster's all those years ago that have been turned into something else that was all down there too

1896
02:23:08,883 --> 02:23:10,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's all at Americamart.

1897
02:23:10,324 --> 02:23:14,846
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's something that the basement of the Hilton was famously known for.

1898
02:23:14,846 --> 02:23:15,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1899
02:23:15,546 --> 02:23:18,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby translated it to Hilton's or to DragonCon speak to it.

1900
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know exactly what room you're talking about.

1901
02:23:20,329 --> 02:23:22,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a great it's with the partitions are down.

1902
02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:23,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.

1903
02:23:23,851 --> 02:23:26,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that space when it was tabletop.

1904
02:23:26,092 --> 02:23:31,655
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, most people would argue it was better when tabletop was there.

1905
02:23:33,017 --> 02:23:36,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like America Mart for being spacious.

1906
02:23:36,119 --> 02:23:41,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, going back to to Ranma's concerns, America Mart is spacious.

1907
02:23:41,442 --> 02:23:47,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't really like you're not up people's asses like maybe you were in the Hilton Galleria like really close together.

1908
02:23:47,106 --> 02:23:52,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was it's I think a lot of people like tabletop better when it was down there.

1909
02:23:52,008 --> 02:23:54,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, all right.

1910
02:23:54,510 --> 02:23:55,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Love the email party on Garth.

[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1920
02:24:24,774 --> 02:24:27,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, did you I guess do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

1921
02:24:28,666 --> 02:24:29,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Or no, we ran out, didn't we?

1922
02:24:29,667 --> 02:24:30,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1923
02:24:30,047 --> 02:24:30,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1924
02:24:30,247 --> 02:24:30,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1925
02:24:30,527 --> 02:24:31,568
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done.

1926
02:24:31,568 --> 02:24:31,988
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1927
02:24:31,988 --> 02:24:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then that's it.

1928
02:24:32,868 --> 02:24:35,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a we've had a pretty good show tonight.

1929
02:24:35,350 --> 02:24:38,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to wrap up and say we will see you in two weeks.

1930
02:24:38,972 --> 02:24:45,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not going to be here Memorial Day weekend, so we will not have a show, but I believe DarkSakura will still be streaming.

1931
02:24:45,176 --> 02:24:47,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's doing some other stuff as well, right?

1932
02:24:47,197 --> 02:24:48,878
[SPEAKER_05]: With your Minecraft buddies, right?

1933
02:24:48,878 --> 02:24:50,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, on Saturday.

1934
02:24:50,979 --> 02:24:54,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I'm going to be streaming a little bit earlier than before.

1935
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:54,980
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1936
02:24:54,980 --> 02:24:55,440
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1937
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you, if you need some, and Bobby will be here at the Voice Geeks Network, holding down the fort alone.

1938
02:24:59,582 --> 02:25:09,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you need the, and maybe what's going on Sunday, maybe if it works out, I might still be able to call into Bobby's show if he wants, but no promises on that.

1939
02:25:09,665 --> 02:25:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that's, that's it.

1940
02:25:12,185 --> 02:25:14,286
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you in two weeks until then.

1941
02:25:14,286 --> 02:25:18,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, as I always say at the end of show, thank you so much for listening to Orange Tons Radio and supporting the show.

1942
02:25:18,347 --> 02:25:20,428
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.

1943
02:25:20,808 --> 02:25:26,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.

1944
02:25:26,152 --> 02:25:33,037
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way.

1945
02:25:33,037 --> 02:25:35,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we are on YouTube now, but it is just the podcast.

1946
02:25:35,619 --> 02:25:37,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the audio with the static video.

1947
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:44,746
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to see the actual video, you do have to be a subscriber of our Twitch channel over at VOG Network.

1948
02:25:44,746 --> 02:25:45,987
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1949
02:25:45,987 --> 02:25:46,848
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I've got.

1950
02:25:46,848 --> 02:25:47,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get final thoughts.

1951
02:25:47,829 --> 02:25:50,431
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, oh, you were not streaming tonight, but we'll still start with you.

1952
02:25:51,328 --> 02:25:56,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm really, really tired.

1953
02:25:56,150 --> 02:26:03,212
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a great time playing pinball and all of y'all should play more pinball.

1954
02:26:03,212 --> 02:26:05,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I will get on that immediately.

1955
02:26:05,733 --> 02:26:09,134
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, your final thought?

1956
02:26:09,134 --> 02:26:15,677
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is hopefully I will get some more work done on the theme park this week.

1957
02:26:15,677 --> 02:26:16,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming along.

1958
02:26:17,588 --> 02:26:19,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1959
02:26:19,069 --> 02:26:22,371
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought I am looking forward to vacation.

1960
02:26:22,371 --> 02:26:26,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of can't believe it's in like three days, but I'm very much looking forward to it.

1961
02:26:26,814 --> 02:26:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to seeing friends having fun.

1962
02:26:28,515 --> 02:26:30,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a good time.

1963
02:26:30,717 --> 02:26:31,517
[SPEAKER_05]: What up Chicago?

1964
02:26:31,517 --> 02:26:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: See you in three days.

1965
02:26:32,238 --> 02:26:32,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited.

1966
02:26:32,598 --> 02:26:35,060
[SPEAKER_05]: My first visit since the Panini so excited.

1967
02:26:36,101 --> 02:26:37,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy gaming.

1968
02:26:37,083 --> 02:26:38,665
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff coming out this week.

1969
02:26:38,665 --> 02:26:43,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, as we were talking about earlier in the show, probably all the old shit you've been playing probably got remixed at some point.

1970
02:26:43,995 --> 02:26:45,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy gaming.

1971
02:26:45,457 --> 02:26:46,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy gaming.

1972
02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:47,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy catching up on your backlog.

1973
02:26:49,838 --> 02:26:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy your couple weeks.

1974
02:26:51,119 --> 02:26:52,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

1975
02:26:52,339 --> 02:26:56,462
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right into the thick of E3 Memorial time.

1976
02:26:56,462 --> 02:27:01,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we will have hit any press conferences yet by the next show or will we?

1977
02:27:01,404 --> 02:27:02,725
[SPEAKER_05]: What date would the next show be?

1978
02:27:02,725 --> 02:27:04,266
[SPEAKER_05]: The next show will be June 2nd.

1979
02:27:04,266 --> 02:27:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think we hit any pressers yet, but we'll be right before it.

1980
02:27:08,048 --> 02:27:11,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll kind of have a view of what everything's going to look like that week.

1981
02:27:11,209 --> 02:27:12,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be fun.

1982
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:13,891
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1983
02:27:13,891 --> 02:27:14,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1984
02:27:14,711 --> 02:27:15,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.

1985
02:27:15,451 --> 02:27:17,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1986
02:27:17,332 --> 02:27:18,113
