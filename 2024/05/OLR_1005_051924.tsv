9662	18970	It's not often that a game is substantially broken twice, first with its initial release and ongoing slate of bug fixing updates, as well as any additional content created for it, then a significant overhaul that comes nine years later.
18970	24514	After a product is released, modders take action into their own hands and tweak details for memes, playability, opinions, trolling, and more.
24514	28777	It's not common that a later release comes that creates massive swaths of fallout in this community.
28777	30239	This is the Nuclear Blast Headline.
30239	35162	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35162	37284	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39653	42517	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
42517	46863	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46863	54173	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1005 of our program for tonight.
56175	58437	May 19, 2024.
58437	68044	My name is Rob Roberts here with you week after week after week after week after week with my co-hosts, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68044	80694	She may actually join us a little later in the show, but you may have heard her mentioning last week on the show or last couple weeks, really, that she had a big pinball expo down in Lodi, the Golden State Pinball Expo that she was going to be doing.
80694	84317	And I know on her social, she's been talking about contributing on some of the pinball
84797	88359	Podcasts and broadcasts and productions coming out of that.
88359	92181	So I think her presence tonight will just depend on when that all wraps up.
92181	96163	And when she gets home, if she can join us towards the end, she will give us a report from the show.
96163	102386	But if not, actually, I just literally as I'm talking, I don't know if she's listening, but I just got a text.
102386	104307	I'm still at camp so likely won't be home.
104307	104747	Sorry.
104747	105887	So that's that's that.
105887	108048	So I guess we're not going to get joined by DarkSakura tonight.
108048	109109	But we will talk to her
109409	109709	DarkSakura
139673	140533	I'm doing pretty good.
140533	140973	Yeah.
140973	143214	Any pinball in your weekend?
143214	144015	No, no.
144015	144435	All right.
144435	145475	All right.
145475	149497	Well, maybe we'll see if there was Minecraft or maybe something outside Minecraft.
149497	150817	We'll get into that with your gaming week.
150817	152518	There might be both of those things.
152518	154418	Maybe, maybe a little bit.
154418	157539	But first, I think we'll get right into our kickoff topic for tonight.
157539	159720	So let's get into it.
159720	161481	Loki, what's going on in the gaming world this week?
161801	163422	Let's get dangerous.
163422	167044	That's PlayStation five sales.
167044	170927	So the of course, articles been out saying, hey, you know what?
170927	174209	They've fallen short of the PlayStation four records.
174209	180612	Even apparently only half as many PlayStation four owners have a PlayStation five.
180612	185095	And yeah, I'm one of those people that doesn't have a PlayStation five.
187082	193006	So right now they've reached almost 60 million lifetime sales.
193006	199230	And of course, you know, six or I'm sorry, 60 million is in what the PlayStation 4 achieved.
199230	205714	They've was a 59.2 million, essentially the same, you know.
205714	216341	Of course, you know, they said that as we enter the second half of the console cycle, we expect the number of new PlayStation five units to gradually decline, which, yeah, makes sense because people already have them.
217572	221114	They will probably wait for the next console if that's the case.
221114	227759	Or in my case, just play things as they come out on PC because everything's here.
227759	230360	So why not?
230360	233222	Except for Final Fantasy, you know, 16.
233222	235023	That's that's not here yet.
235023	236905	Not yet, but we know it's coming.
236905	238466	Yeah, it will be coming at some point.
238466	243449	We always kind of knew it was gonna hit PC even though they were being a little bit coy about it in the beginning.
243449	244890	We kind of knew it was coming.
244890	245030	So
245990	259820	Yeah, so along with that, of course, funny that we're even hearing about this now, but apparently there's now new ways to jailbreak your PlayStation 4 using a TV because that's fun.
259820	261101	It used to be web pages.
261101	262582	Now it's TVs.
262582	265584	So pretty sweet.
265584	267505	Brand new LG TVs if you run those.
268308	275015	Funny enough, I just got an LG TV, so I don't think I'll be jailbreaking my PlayStation 4 because I don't play my PlayStation 4.
275015	276376	Jailbreak your PS4 to do what?
276376	279259	Like play, uh, backups.
279259	282583	Oh, you can do what you can do, what you can play backups.
282583	284385	So the legal things you could do with it.
284385	285986	I was like, isn't it already region free?
285986	286267	Okay.
286267	286507	Okay.
286647	288088	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S
302625	312732	Or loading custom homebrew software, like emulators and that type of thing.
312732	316534	Get your emulator device with your PlayStation 4.
316534	323218	So that's the kind of legal-ish stuff that you would do with it, aside from stealing things.
324542	327424	Yeah, it's it's hard.
327424	329725	I don't want to do that.
329725	331926	So this is very interesting, though.
331926	338150	This whole fact about the PlayStation five sales slowing way down is is a little bit shocking in a way.
338150	339991	Well, it's not shocking, I don't think, actually.
339991	345974	And you kind of yeah, you put the needle on it when you said you yourself have not.
345974	348096	And you've been doing a game podcast for 20 years.
348096	351838	You don't feel the obligation to get a PS5 because you're going to get those games somewhere else.
352538	359201	Well, it's not even that like it's like I bought a an Xbox Series X in like in previous console generations.
359201	362082	Actually, it's usually been that I pick one or the other.
362082	370365	So Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 actually had both had all all of the systems in the following generation.
370365	376447	I had a PlayStation 4 because I kind of looked at it like, OK, the games I want to play are going to be on PlayStation.
376447	378348	So, you know, I was looking forward to that.
378348	380149	I think like PlayStation VR, obviously,
380669	383952	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
393363	395825	I like the games that are coming out on it.
395825	402849	You know, I was looking forward to like those Microsoft Purchase Studios, so like the Bethesda exclusive games and stuff like that.
402849	410594	I really wanted to play on a Series X. That said, I have like hardly gamed on that Series X. It is in a box below my desk right now.
410594	411755	That is it.
411755	414777	I play everything on a PC now for the most part.
415797	422359	And I mean, that's kind of now that more games are coming out from Sony on PC.
422359	431961	It's like, why would I spend $500 on a console that plays a handful of games that I can't get right now on PC?
431961	435122	Like there's not really a use case for it.
435122	440543	Like you could say, oh, PlayStation VR 2, but then you have to drop another $500 for that too.
440543	442624	Like, no, I don't want to do that.
442624	443104	You know, it's
443704	454948	Just not something I see myself doing and even like next console generation, aside from Nintendo, Nintendo gets purchased every time like that is just its own thing.
454948	458830	Next generation, I might not even get a console, it may be just
460029	463734	play what's on PC, you know, depending on what's coming out.
463734	468360	They have to really like sell me on why I need a console.
468360	473747	And I don't think a lot of like, especially when it comes to Microsoft, I don't think they really care if I have a console.
473747	476150	They just like, yeah, it's player games.
476150	476971	You know, we'll put them on PC.
478377	486680	I wanna go to our chat, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
486680	492341	We appreciate all those follows over on our Twitch channel, where we broadcast right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.
492341	493662	And Bobby is in chat saying,
494142	496885	So many games still release on PlayStation 4.
496885	503352	Yeah, DJ Ranma S kind of following up that comment saying, I mean about half of the PlayStation 5 games are PS4 ports.
503352	504433	I think it's more than that.
504433	509018	So for me, there was no reason to buy one until Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth dropped.
509018	511700	Yeah, I bought Final Fantasy 16, but I was just waiting.
512721	522450	S2100Mad has an excellent point too, saying, I will say the PS5 not being readily available for 2 years after launch really kept me away from gaming.
522450	525332	I wholeheartedly agree with that.
525332	530877	It's that whole thing where a movie makes its best box office opening weekend, a game sells
531637	539522	usually, and I should say usually because there are strange cases like, you know, when Titanic came out, I don't think it actually made its most money the first weekend.
539522	540582	So there's always exceptions.
540582	548387	But most blockbuster movies, most video games even make most of their money that first weekend, right?
548387	552389	So PlayStation and limited hardware issues really botched that.
552389	555290	And obviously that continued for a very long time.
555290	557792	And I do think that sucked the air out of the room a little bit.
558272	570167	And I think it's that domino effect into what Bobby and Rama just said, is that the reason why so many games were releasing on PlayStation 4, games take more than a year or two to develop.
570167	574312	So PS4 was being targeted because for the longest time, people couldn't get PS5s.
575513	602444	and now it's it turned into this vicious vicious cycle kind of thing because now Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sales are down compared to Final Fantasy VII Remake well because it was limited to PlayStation 5 and just even to this day even though we're years into PlayStation 5 and we're past that point where you could walk into Target and get one uh it just hasn't sold as many units so I I kind of think yeah it was it was kind of doomed from the beginning because the way this hardware rolled out
602964	609391	Now, I think that's in addition to something else that I think is worth talking about as well, because to me, it plays in a little bit too.
609391	614596	Do you remember last week on the show, I was talking a little bit about all these layoffs and things that are going on in the industry.
614596	618280	I was talking about, I really think we're looking at a video game crash.
618780	620502	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
633977	635598	And I think that's a good term for it.
635598	639899	I think there's definitely a cold crash, especially in like that AAA realm, right?
639899	640939	And maybe not the indie realm.
640939	646121	We're always going to get carried by indies because that was something that didn't exist in the Atari 2600 era.
646121	649482	Sure, you can make Halo 2600 now, but you couldn't do that in 1983, 1984.
649482	658905	You know, it wasn't until the Commodore 64 and home computing let you make those games that ironically, that's also kind of when the industry was picking up again, that and the Nintendo and all that stuff.
660385	686068	DJ Ranma S calls it a video game recession, kinda, but it's weird because I think we had such, I think, I think Ranma what's happening is that because we had such an uptick because of COVID and lockdowns and all that, and then such a drop after that, that kind of went past the starting point in a way, I, that's why I kind of lean more towards the term crash, because it's almost like the roller coaster, it went up that hill, and now it's
686889	688831	It's coming way down.
688831	694255	And I think some of that ties into this PlayStation 5 sales as well.
694255	702282	And I think a big part of that is that, again, Loki just illustrated a real incentive why people don't necessarily want to get PlayStation 5s.
702282	704304	They have a computer that can play those games.
704304	706606	Now, not everybody can afford a high-end computer.
706606	711890	That's why consoles exist in the first place and why a console like Xbox Series S
712631	719655	has notably done pretty good because it's that happy medium of like affordability, but plays the current games, right?
719655	720995	But anyway, I digress.
720995	732481	The thing about PlayStation, why did PlayStation 2 really, why did PlayStation 2 really sell oodles and oodles of units?
732481	733382	Was it Final Fantasy 10?
735333	736894	Why did PS3 sell oodles and oodles of units?
736894	739655	It took a little bit, but once a winner was declared in a certain war
750560	752763	PlayStation 3 was one of the most affordable Blu-ray players at the time.
768752	771454	but did it really have any features?
771454	777579	But I would argue that the PlayStation 4 was still, in a way, a must-have media device.
777579	788527	Ironic, because their main competitor in the same generation, the Xbox One, was hinging their entire platform on, do you remember?
788527	790988	TV sports, TV sports, TV, TV sports.
790988	791509	Do you remember that?
792267	793208	It has a passthrough.
793208	797551	It has a passthrough HDMI that did picture-in-picture or something.
797551	802154	Whereas, essentially, PlayStation 4 was kind of doing the same thing.
802154	804215	They just kept the focus on the games.
804215	812741	But I think, realistically, a lot of people were still buying PlayStation 4s because they served as media homes, right?
812741	816684	And I even look at, like, my Xbox Series S or, excuse me, my Series X right now.
816684	817344	What is it serving?
817344	818405	It's pretty much our media hub.
819125	845468	uh it's our it's on our downstairs hgtv and is our twitch machine our blu-ray machine all that stuff but i think a lot of people that's what playstation 4 is is that and and bobby points out ps4 launched with the camera and allowed for ar gaming on day one and ps4 was the first console you could natively stream from very easy i would say those are nice but i don't think they were as much as playstation 4 really selling itself as
846169	850538	In part, the name brand recognition because everybody bought twos and threes.
850538	855949	Lest we forget, the Xbox one also launched with a camera.
856900	857661	and Connect.
857661	858801	Remember it was bundled in.
858801	859522	Couldn't get it.
887240	889002	of the hardware change from PlayStation 3.
889002	890203	Controversial, right?
890203	893705	But, you know, there were so many games released on PlayStation 4 you couldn't get on PlayStation 3.
893705	895787	Sony committed to that platform at that point.
895787	900410	Now, and here it is, SSJ100 Matt jumped to the punchline, but he's absolutely right.
900410	902572	Here's the problem with PlayStation 5.
902572	905114	Now all your smart TVs already do.
905114	907936	TV sports, TV, TV, TV sports, TV sports.
907936	911519	So why should I get a PlayStation 5?
911519	913720	What is that must-have thing
914841	920604	on a PlayStation 5 that I can't get anywhere else.
920604	922365	PlayStation games.
922365	927168	I'm holding up a copy of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth because yes, I still have it sitting here.
927168	928869	That's about it.
928869	936013	Maybe some other miscellaneous games that didn't release on PS4, but that's it's there's it's not as compelling.
936013	939015	It's not nearly as compelling as the other systems that we went through.
939778	956106	And considering that like, you know, PlayStation Now, I could see them eventually having that on smart TVs as well to stream, because that's certainly where xCloud wants to go if it's not already on some devices.
956106	957707	And it would be just smart for them to do that.
957707	960469	The problem is the PlayStation Now and xCloud are
961628	967514	not the same at all, like equivalent wise for what you're getting for what you pay for.
967514	971778	Not even close to being the same value, I feel.
971778	972939	Garth the Wolf in chat.
972939	975661	Hey, good to see you, by the way, says the controller is neat.
975661	976162	I would agree.
976162	978284	The PlayStation five controller is pretty rad.
978284	981206	But the problem is you could buy that controller separately.
981206	985330	Well, I don't know if that's really a problem, but it's a fact you could buy it separately.
985330	986792	So you don't even need the whole PlayStation.
987392	991397	And that controller works really well on a PC or on your phone.
991397	996983	If you have the the Delta emulator that just changed its logo because of an Adobe lawsuit.
996983	1004011	If you have that emulator, you can hook that up with a PS5 controller and you've got a pretty cool little classic gaming thing in your fucking pocket right now.
1004011	1007695	Yeah, the PlayStation 5 controller is neat, but technically it's not going to sell the system.
1009450	1014235	I also like the Xbox Series controller, to be honest.
1014235	1017519	I also think they have a good controller.
1017519	1020483	So I think it's really just a matter of which one do you like more.
1022941	1024562	So it's kind of, it's kind of interesting.
1024562	1031168	It's, it's, it's interesting that PlayStation 5 has not created a compelling argument for why you need one necessarily.
1031168	1042817	I mean, there are some games, and I think for gamers, but again, I think for the mass audience that bought PlayStation 3s and 4s because they were cheap media devices and Blu-ray players, I don't think PlayStation 5 brought anything new to the table there.
1043217	1050280	So I think Sony is going to need to leverage what it does with movies and entertainment when it comes to the PlayStation 6.
1050280	1059543	So ironically, as much as we all made fun of TV sports, TV sports, TV, TV sports, I really think that's how they're going to sell PlayStation 6 when it comes to that.
1059543	1059844	Although.
1061104	1066072	Interesting aside, interesting aside, Loki, you kind of glossed it over.
1066072	1068515	But I think it's really important in what you said.
1068515	1070939	You were kind of like, I don't buy consoles anymore.
1070939	1073983	You're like, but Nintendo, I mean, Nintendo doesn't really count.
1073983	1075065	But you know, Nintendo does their own thing.
1076803	1080626	Nintendo counts.
1080626	1082928	And we all know Nintendo.
1082928	1084850	Nintendo is good at Nintendo, right?
1084850	1088934	They very much are against the PC thing and all of that.
1088934	1089254	Very much.
1089254	1092097	If they're putting their games on PC, then maybe I'll stop buying the console.
1092677	1096761	But I think the portability is huge for them right now too.
1096761	1101765	And that's why, you know, there's no question the Switch 2 is still a Switch.
1101765	1109252	Like there's no question, you know, especially in the fact that Nintendo has changed their hardware pretty significantly over the years.
1109252	1110673	If you look at the jump from
1111394	1113856	Super Nintendo to GameCube.
1113856	1115397	GameCube to Wii.
1115397	1121721	As much as we joke, as two GameCubes stuck together, we all know that the hardware cell in the controller was much bigger than that.
1121721	1125243	And then the Wii U was a hardware jump, for better or for worse.
1125243	1127364	Then the Wii U to Switch.
1127364	1130907	Those are really major pivots from system to system for Nintendo.
1132066	1135330	much different than what we're talking about PlayStation in my opinion.
1135330	1138974	But I think switch to switch to no fucking question.
1138974	1147404	They're going to keep the portability and the playing it on a TV because it's working really, really well for them.
1147404	1148646	Oh, yeah, I just you're right.
1151378	1155040	Chat just pointed out I completely skipped Nintendo 64.
1155040	1155460	You're right.
1155460	1156280	You're right.
1156280	1158481	But okay, add it in.
1158481	1159602	What else really changed?
1159602	1168126	I mean, I would say yeah, with the cartridge base, maybe and all that, but I would say those are still pretty heavy pivots even between, you know, adding that in there.
1168126	1177591	So for the record, I didn't buy a Nintendo 64 until way late when I got a Pikachu N64 for 20 bucks.
1177591	1179832	So that probably explains part of the Nintendo 64 erasure.
1180740	1183102	I had one and then I threw it away.
1183102	1183302	Whoa.
1183302	1186025	Because I'm an idiot.
1186025	1187206	I don't know why.
1187206	1191109	I just, for some reason, I was like, Oh, I'm never going to use this.
1191109	1193632	And I mean, to be fair, I didn't.
1193632	1195453	And now I can just play it on other things.
1195453	1197195	So, you know.
1197195	1197335	Yeah.
1198949	1205872	Tigerclaw in chat says yeah, I think Nintendo has that market down a portable system that dubs as a console they found their niche.
1205872	1215336	Well, yeah, I mean, Nintendo has been dominating the handheld market ever since the fucking Game Boy really does any has anybody come close to Nintendo?
1215336	1221379	Maybe the PSP maybe but I would say even then it was pretty far apart.
1221379	1226601	So I think the PSP did good but I guess not good enough for Sony to continue it.
1226601	1227702	I think this is why
1228683	1230004	the Steam Deck.
1230004	1230764	Okay, fair.
1230764	1231604	I'll give you that.
1231604	1234526	That's, that's a little bit that's kind of a portable PC.
1234526	1235426	It's not.
1235426	1236287	But I'll give you that.
1236287	1237387	I'll give you that.
1237387	1244331	Um, what was I gonna say with the Oh, this is why you're hearing the rumors about Xbox and their next.
1244331	1250454	They may be working on a portable thing because the next Xbox might be a portable console.
1250454	1252535	Speaking of Steam Decks, we'll see.
1255587	1260691	Orange right in chat says iOS Android shouldn't count but it kind of does.
1260691	1261452	Here's the problem.
1261452	1263953	Here's why it doesn't count.
1263953	1269658	That that the in there's no official gaming controller for Apple or Android.
1269658	1270959	Yes, you can hook one up.
1270959	1272099	Yes, they support.
1272099	1273320	There's no official one.
1273320	1273681	Many have
1274329	1275929	There's no official one.
1275929	1283592	And for that reason, all of the games still rely on the touch controls, which are horrible for most of your typical types of video games.
1283592	1288373	To be fair, though, like PC doesn't have any official gaming controllers either.
1288373	1292635	I mean, like Steam, which is nice, is pretty flexible with what it supports.
1292635	1295135	So it's kind of like Android.
1295135	1298696	In that sense, Windows 11 would disagree with you.
1298696	1301117	I mean, technically, I don't have to know about that.
1301117	1302337	Microsoft makes a controller.
1302337	1303838	But yes, I got I get what you're saying.
1303838	1303978	Yes.
1304926	1305967	Well, I'm talking about Steam.
1305967	1306467	Yeah, Windows 11.
1306467	1313954	I mean, I like my Xbox Series controller that I have right now.
1313954	1316677	I mean, it works just fine.
1316677	1317477	Like, I don't know.
1317477	1318719	Like, don't change it.
1318719	1321141	You can have those fancy triggers, I guess, but.
1321141	1323543	I don't know.
1323543	1325605	Next generation, they're all going to copy each other anyways.
1327386	1330347	E3VL says no AAA exclusives on mobile.
1330347	1333369	Bobby Blackwell says what do you consider AAA exclusives because there are plenty of mobile-only games made by AAA studios.
1348696	1370490	is like abandoning ship when it comes to like and isn't that interesting they tried to dip their water of putting i mean granted they wouldn't put their actual games but to give them some credit they were trying to make games that catered to the limited control i actually appreciate that nintendo did not try to put super mario brothers on a phone and that they did the run thing because it wouldn't have worked
1371110	1374011	as well, you know, with the touchscreen and all that stuff.
1374011	1376832	But obviously those games did not take off.
1376832	1383373	But you have, you know, when I think of AAA mobile phone games, I don't think of things made by your traditional publishers.
1383373	1389295	Granted, Pokemon Go, but even that's the Pokemon companies in an agreement with Niantic for that.
1389295	1396777	Nintendo is really not involved in Pokemon Go, except for, you know, investment, I guess, if nothing else.
1396777	1397717	But, you know,
1398377	1402581	But what, yes, but I would also say like, I actually wouldn't call pigment a triple A title.
1402581	1418635	It's doing well, but it's not triple A. But I think you look at those games like Candy Crush, Clash of Kings, you know, the stuff that tends to top the charts that just, you know, and that they get what's, what's the one with Kathy Bates and all the ads murder mansion or whatever the over the top on those.
1420396	1424542	None of those games are like, you know, accurate to their advertisements.
1424542	1428628	But like Animal Crossing, like Pocket Camp, I mean, that's probably done well, I think.
1429491	1433413	uh, I don't aren't they like sunsetting support or something for that?
1433413	1435894	I don't think it's doing as well as they thought.
1435894	1439176	So Bobby is pointing out that Japan tends to do better.
1439176	1441937	Like Kingdom Hearts spinoff stood all right on mobile.
1441937	1445558	And Japan seems like a more hardcore mobile gaming culture in the US.
1445558	1447759	And that that's, you know, there's been a lot of talk about that.
1447759	1450941	And just with Japan being more transit culture and all of that.
1451681	1457447	Yeah, well, yeah, Fortnite's a good well, obviously, there's been some issues with Apple versus Fortnite.
1457447	1460350	But I think that's resolving at this point.
1460350	1464795	So Fortnite will be a mobile title again, or a lot of people still have been playing it on mobile one way or another.
1464795	1465976	So I don't know.
1465976	1466357	But anyway,
1466877	1477104	We're digressing a little bit from why aren't PlayStation fives selling but I do think ironically it's going to be you have to be able to cater them to more than just the gamer.
1477104	1484009	It's got to be that family device something that convinces the non gamer in the household to want to want one too.
1484009	1487291	And I think that was true of the prior PlayStations.
1487291	1492315	And it wasn't different enough on PlayStation five because the PlayStation four still did everything.
1492315	1493436	So I don't know that's just
1494036	1494396	I mean, just cause...
1517543	1524788	It's because they are operating under the assumption that they can have infinite growth and that just doesn't exist.
1524788	1527390	Or that Battle Passes print money.
1527390	1543701	There's just... Or that they can argue for a $70 price point when they sell Battle Passes and cosmetics and all this other stuff that they tag on to it like we're idiots and go, Oh, well, no, games haven't gone up in price forever.
1544281	1550046	because what happens in the boardroom is that people do, we did some market research.
1550046	1559012	We did market research and here's what people are buying in Fortnite and the hottest games on the market is they're going to buy skins and they like to buy dances and games.
1559012	1560413	They like to buy all this stuff.
1560413	1572623	So we're going to put all these things because our market research has shown this is how Fortnite's making their money and gamers are going to buy it in our game too because they buy it in Fortnite and nobody along the way stops to ask the question,
1573709	1580653	is this game good enough for people to want to spend that kind of extra money to invest in it and buy that extra crap?
1580653	1583274	Nowhere along the way do people ask that question.
1583274	1586876	They want to sell $70 game and monetize it like a mobile game that's free to play.
1586876	1592419	Yeah, which you can try to do that and sometimes be successful with it.
1592419	1595421	But also you're gonna have part of your audience
1596488	1597309	Thank you all
1613906	1631294	how many dozens of times have we seen games launch in such a broken state that it like it's just it can you imagine i mean we can't imagine because tesla but like can you imagine like a car being like released in this type of state where it's just
1631994	1634915	Oh yeah, randomly it just swerves to the left.
1634915	1635996	Hope you're cool with that.
1635996	1644720	Like, you know, sometimes it comes with three wheels and you're missing one, but you know, we'll eventually get you one so you can drive your car like it.
1644720	1646521	It's like stupid stuff like that.
1646521	1646681	Like.
1648092	1648732	I don't understand.
1648732	1653955	I mean, clearly they know the state that the game is launching in, but they're just like, yeah, we're cool with that.
1653955	1655856	Just put it out and we'll fix it later.
1655856	1663761	Like, that's the problem is they want you to buy into these games that are quickly like they're rushing through them.
1663761	1669904	They're forcing these studios to make these, you know, games that fleece the users to a ridiculous.
1669904	1671705	They put all these mechanics in that just
1672245	1689188	are counterintuitive to good gameplay and a good gameplay design and loop and all that stuff and it's just it's just to in this to get more money and I mean like how many of these studios are talking about live service games like nobody on the like sure live service games make money but
1690097	1692139	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1705613	1709016	By the way, less people are having kids these days.
1709016	1712318	But that's because the live service games whole thing.
1712318	1722586	Um, anyway, I want to point this out, though, because Quest Buster in chat says all of these massive triple A budgets are pushing aside everything else in their pipelines to focus on sure bets.
1722586	1725308	I would argue there is no sure bet in gaming right now.
1725308	1728491	I mean, because some things you would think are sure bets.
1729807	1731588	We're not sure bets.
1731588	1734629	The Avengers is on the line and would like to have a word.
1734629	1738611	Suicide Squad is requesting a shout out right now.
1738611	1740251	But that's it, Loki.
1740251	1742652	Gamers fucking talk.
1742652	1744893	And they're on fucking social media.
1744893	1749495	And it is harder and harder to sell that stuff because people know this shit in advance.
1749495	1751616	And it's happening with movies too.
1751616	1754057	Madame Web is at the door and would like to say hello.
1755137	1775656	like it's it I think because people are able to communicate a lot faster for better for worst word gets out quick that some of these games and some of these movies are fucking stingers and especially when Suicide Squad does this transparent battle pass shit for a game that is mediocre
1777307	1789111	It's just it's it's like even if an indie studio did that, like it would be called out the same way as far as like recycling content within your own game to pad it out.
1789111	1798554	Like like Ubisoft just said that with their triple A or quadruple A game or whatever, Sea of Thieves or not Sea of Thieves.
1798554	1799515	I remember what it's called now.
1799515	1800335	See, look at that.
1800335	1802076	It's disappeared from my brain.
1802076	1803176	I don't even remember anymore.
1804056	1806777	It's not Sea of Thieves because Sea of Thieves is pretty good.
1806777	1809497	Sea of Thieves was not a quadruple A game either.
1809497	1810618	It was not a quadruple A game.
1810618	1816059	But once again, you know, their game is literally it made such an impression on me.
1816059	1817479	I don't remember it now.
1817479	1819240	Literally a couple of months after it came out.
1819240	1821080	So.
1821080	1827742	I mean, that's it's I don't know what's going to end up happening.
1827742	1829862	Unfortunately, you're going to have a lot.
1829862	1831022	Record WN for the win.
1831022	1831623	Skull and bones.
1831623	1832683	Skull and bones.
1832683	1832943	Yeah.
1834130	1834830	I don't care.
1834830	1837512	I'm going to forget it tomorrow anyways.
1837512	1841474	That's 70 bones with an optional battle pass.
1841474	1848859	It's just like I don't we're going to see a lot of these studios, unfortunately, closed down because of this.
1848859	1854282	I'm hoping we'll get a lot more indie studios out of it that hopefully make some quality games.
1854282	1858524	You know, there's like that's the thing with like indie game indie titles I played like this year.
1858524	1861486	I'm more excited about those than a lot of the AAA games that are coming out.
1861866	1866347	And honestly, I just want to say this before we get corrected.
1866347	1875730	Because when people kind of go down this route, there are people very quick to shout, you can't just stop everything you're doing and start an indie studio be doing an indie studio doesn't pay your bills.
1875730	1876591	It's a long term.
1876591	1878611	Yeah, I get that.
1878611	1879031	I get it.
1879031	1879652	And it sucks.
1879652	1883633	There's a lot of people that are falling out of the industry that aren't going to go back.
1883633	1885153	That has to be acknowledged.
1885153	1886594	And it sucks.
1886594	1886674	Um,
1888666	1894489	But what, you know, people, people are going to move on to jobs that have the guaranteed income and that that sort of thing.
1894489	1896951	And not everybody's going to be able to start in indie studio.
1896951	1898832	And we are going to have lost art.
1898832	1899873	And that sucks.
1899873	1907957	That's why I love the happy ending when a group can get a new studio together and get that backing and financing and make a great product.
1907957	1910499	But that unfortunately does tend to be the fairy tale ending.
1911469	1913650	or make make smaller budget games.
1913650	1914931	Perfect example.
1914931	1916832	I have a game playing behind me right now.
1916832	1918053	Let me put it real quick.
1918053	1919554	Let me put it this way.
1919554	1925417	I want more investors to invest in smaller indie studios.
1925417	1926557	That's my wish.
1926557	1928078	How about that?
1928078	1929879	But not purchase them.
1929879	1930440	Yes.
1930440	1930600	So
1931764	1936826	I have a game behind me right now called Animal Well that came out recently.
1936826	1940288	It's like the game size itself is very small.
1940288	1946451	It's, you know, pretty simple, like kind of 16 bit sprite graphics.
1946451	1953534	But it's like a really critically acclaimed game because you don't have to spend and I think it was made by like one dude.
1953534	1955035	You don't have to spend
1955999	1968229	a huge budget to make a game anymore like you don't have to do that that's the thing is like a lot of these students are spending like hundreds of millions like the Suicide Squad game they spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make this thing
1969503	1988847	where like where did they spend that money because i can't see anywhere that it went i mean i engine development maybe i don't know but like it's just it's certainly not in the assets that are this is probably a big big part of that which is why using ai to skip that step which is what's going to happen is very controversial
1990441	1996445	Yeah, and so, you know, I think smaller scale games are OK.
1996445	1997786	Like, I think it should do that.
1997786	2004611	Helldivers, another good example of a game that smaller studio really popped off because it was a fun game.
2004611	2006573	You have to build a good game.
2006573	2008594	You can't build a game based off.
2008594	2011677	You have to build a game based off of gameplay in the concept there.
2011677	2017221	You can't build a game off of the monetization that you're going to put in it and then make a game around that.
2017221	2018642	Like, you just can't do that.
2019144	2024214	And of course SSJ100 Matt says super multitasking and pixel poops number two also find examples.
2024214	2024374	Yes.
2025754	2026635	Yes.
2026635	2027815	All right.
2027815	2031817	This is I mean, this this this is the industry in a nutshell right now.
2031817	2032878	And it's going to be very interesting.
2032878	2041202	You know, we are a couple of weeks away from E3 Memorial Press Announcement Week, you know, in early because we know Microsoft's going to give us announcements.
2041202	2044084	We know Nintendo is going to give us announcements.
2044084	2047406	I think there's a couple others that have confirmed as well for the E3 Memorial Week.
2047406	2048947	There is no E3 this year.
2048947	2049287	There is no E3.
2049847	2052408	Well, Sony didn't do the same week last year.
2052408	2056269	They haven't done the same week since the pandemic, and since they kind of dropped out of E3 either.
2056269	2057629	So they may wait till August.
2057629	2062631	But anyway, the E3 Memorial announcements are coming, Summer Game Fest, if you will.
2062631	2068112	So it'll be it'll be interesting to see what is in gaming's future over the next few months.
2068112	2069913	But we'll continue to talk about it here on this show.
2069913	2072633	But for now, let's move on to some other topics.
2072633	2073854	Because we got a lot to cover tonight.
2073854	2076515	And I want to also make sure we talk about our gaming weeks.
2076515	2077815	So Loki, how was your gaming week?
2078992	2083274	My gaming week was playing Minecraft.
2083274	2089037	Minecraft's 15th anniversary was on Friday, so it's 15 years old.
2089037	2095459	And so I was unrelated as just playing Minecraft.
2095459	2099981	Working on actually forcing myself to work on the actual theme park.
2099981	2104463	So I was designing the front gates for the theme park.
2104463	2105704	So that's coming along pretty well.
2106384	2116647	And then in the meantime, I was recording a bit for this guy, BirdBoy, who is doing like a collab with them, sort of.
2116647	2120148	It's making content for them, kind of.
2120148	2122248	So I was just working on that.
2122248	2124869	Of course, my mic settings are all messed up and I hate that.
2124869	2132291	But then aside from that, I did play a ton of Turbo Kid.
2132291	2134672	So still playing through that.
2135675	2137876	I'm pretty much at the end of the game.
2137876	2153423	I'm at the last boss battle, but I'm going through and trying to not 100% everything, because I don't know if you can easily, but I'm trying to like find all of the hidden things, the collectibles in the game right now, just going through some of that stuff.
2153423	2156265	And then probably I'll just beat it and then move on to something else.
2156265	2157065	Maybe Animal World.
2157065	2160727	I haven't played Animal World yet, but I want to.
2160727	2163048	I just didn't want to start a second Metroidvania and, you know,
2164386	2170629	during another Metroidvania, still want to play Fallout 4, which we'll get into that a little bit later.
2170629	2174612	But but they keep updating it and it keeps breaking everything.
2174612	2176953	So that sucks.
2176953	2180135	But I'll eventually get around to that again.
2180135	2187939	Yeah, it's working on trying to get an episode out probably this week because it's been two weeks already and get that ball rolling.
2187939	2188219	All right.
2189532	2190213	My Game of the Week.
2190213	2193835	God, y'all are gonna hate what a broken record I sound like because it's a lot of the same games.
2193835	2199519	But here's the wild thing is that there's a lot of new things going on in a lot of the games that I typically play.
2199519	2210966	So Diablo 4, I've been playing this week, but a big new patch and a new season came out for Diablo 4, which is called the Season of Loot, I think, or Loot Unveiled or Loot Reborn or something like that.
2210966	2213588	So Diablo 4 started its new season.
2213588	2214629	And this is a
2215189	2215469	Deablo
2232185	2238069	But I will absolutely back up what many people are saying and that is this is the best Diablo's been since it's launched.
2238069	2241471	This is this is a great thing for the game to get a kick in the butt.
2241471	2250718	And if you still haven't visited the game, I would I would encourage you to check it out because a lot of quality of life things, especially for leveling once you beat the story.
2251158	2254741	You can now do what's called the Helltide from the very beginning of the game.
2254741	2259765	You used to have to wait till you got to level 50 and get to world tier 3 before you could do what's called the Helltide.
2259765	2261947	Now you can do it from the beginning and they amped it up.
2261947	2264109	Now the Helltides have way more monsters.
2264109	2265990	There's a boss you can summon in there.
2265990	2270894	They made it so that doing these things is kind of one of the best ways to level.
2270894	2274297	And because you're doing that instead of going into instant dungeons,
2274957	2282020	Now you actually can feel like there are other people actually playing Diablo 4 because they're all out there also doing the Helltides with you.
2282020	2285802	So you kind of feel like you're pretty often running into other players out there.
2285802	2290004	So what they did with Diablo 4, absolutely great thing for the game.
2290004	2291604	I'm really into it.
2291604	2296187	So yeah, and Questbuster in chat says it took nearly a year of waiting, but Necromancer is fun again.
2296187	2299128	I hear Necromancer is really good and a great place.
2299128	2301409	I am playing Sorcerer or Wizard.
2302009	2306511	only because it's the one class in the game I don't have leveled up from a season yet.
2306511	2307492	It's okay.
2307492	2308892	It's a little slow to start.
2308892	2311974	But now that I'm getting a lot of my abilities, it feels a lot better.
2311974	2316576	But yeah, Diablo 4 is a great place and I'd really encourage you to visit it if you haven't in a little bit.
2316576	2316636	Um,
2318004	2319865	Other games I've been playing this week.
2319865	2321526	You know, I've been doing Pokemon Go.
2321526	2322767	I did Community Day today.
2322767	2327009	I caught 18 shinies, 18 shiny bounce sweets today during Community Day.
2327009	2329110	I walked like five and a quarter miles too.
2329110	2332232	But you know, I had to make, I had kind of a lazy week.
2332232	2336034	So I had to make up and get a big, big walk in today.
2336034	2337375	So I did that.
2337375	2342178	And then one other game I've been spending quite a bit of time with is an old favorite.
2342958	2346120	Blast from the Past, World of Warcraft.
2346120	2351303	And no, this is not World of Warcraft Classic Cataclysm, which I talked about last week.
2351303	2354365	This is a new thing that launched to World of Warcraft this last week.
2354365	2359969	It's called World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria Remix.
2359969	2365412	It is not just World of Warcraft Classic Mists of Pandaria.
2365412	2366352	It is not that.
2366352	2371095	And I thought that's kind of what it was going to be, was a limited time like Pandaria Classic.
2371095	2371576	No, no, no, no.
2372600	2387775	It is full on modern wow, so it has every race class combo including the evokers and the dragon people and like the iron dwarves and all the stuff they've unleashed over the last few, the little fox people on horde.
2388376	2408074	Vulpera I think they're called all that stuff that they have unleashed or last few expansions you can play all of that the level cap is 70 like it is in regular WoW because they did a level smoosh some time ago if you weren't already aware so level cap is 70 dragon flight is a thing that you can do if you have the dragon you can use that embedded but you are limited to just Pandaria
2408794	2428212	and there's no trade professions, there's no selling thing for gold, there's no auction house, so they've kind of stripped it down so it is just questing, dungeon running, raiding, and you can do these things very early on and you don't have to have the best type of gear to be able to do it.
2428812	2435296	And the whole thing kind of runs on with every quest that you turn in, you get a box of random loot.
2435296	2440959	And you get random gems that do a fixes to things, which ironically feels a lot like Diablo.
2440959	2446943	But for folks that did the plunder storm a couple months ago, it's a lot of stuff you saw in that you get random effects.
2446943	2449524	And you have this cape that you're wearing.
2449524	2452806	And you just randomly get stats added to your cape.
2452806	2457349	So you suddenly become like super strong and you're just like rolling through things.
2457349	2457469	It's
2458569	2460932	It's really, really satisfying.
2460932	2472482	And I think a really smart thing that Blizzard did here because they found a really happy medium between nostalgic wow, for people that haven't played in a long time, like me,
2473443	2480746	and here's all the new modern WoW mechanics like Dragonflight, Talent Trees, Classes.
2480746	2486709	Here's all the new modern WoW mechanics so you can get used to them before the next expansion.
2486709	2493231	And by the way, when you finish Mists of Pandaria Remix and this whole thing closes down because only limited time is only like 90 days.
2493231	2498033	Once it's done in 90 days, these characters will transfer to the regular realm.
2498033	2501715	So you'll have a character already ready to go for the next expansion.
2502535	2510397	But you leveled it and did everything in more familiar content to those of you that haven't played WoW in a while.
2510397	2514779	Very smart on Blizzard's part, as far as I'm concerned, and the Warcraft team.
2514779	2520701	I think it's a lot of fun and very satisfying to play, and it's helping me get used to what modern WoW really feels like.
2520701	2524962	I'm playing a tanking monk because I really, I really like brewmaster monks.
2524962	2531024	They are so much fun doing the beer splashing and then spitting fire on everybody is extremely satisfying.
2531644	2551291	I've been playing this a little bit with my pal Shane, who sometimes comes on this show, and he brought up a really great point, is that not only do the characters transfer to the Forever Realm in the regular game, but all of the cosmetics you're earning, all of the transmog you're getting, all of that also will carry over into the main game.
2551291	2559394	So it's almost like this is a way that you can get everything you missed in Pandaria and never have to play it again.
2560430	2566412	And I wonder if they're not going to do this for some of the other expansions later on to help people get caught up.
2566412	2571474	I mean, it's very, very, very interesting, but it's a it's a lot of fun.
2571474	2575536	PodCulture in chat says Rob playing WoW, Return of Horde House confirmed.
2575536	2580257	Hey, if only the other guys were also playing WoW, which I think Grandpa might be.
2580257	2583899	Grandpa's an Overwatch player now, believe it or not.
2583899	2585940	Ekstafir also an Overwatch player.
2585940	2587200	I don't know if he plays a lot of WoW.
2587200	2589041	Shane is playing WoW.
2589041	2589321	But yeah.
2590583	2592404	very, very, very interesting.
2592404	2596266	And yeah, it's it's been a little bit of a time sink for me, but a lot of fun.
2596266	2599208	And Oh, what one other familiar game dead by daylight.
2599208	2604811	I know we talked a lot about it on the show, but yet another limited time mode going on in that game.
2604811	2612916	Not only did they have triple blood points this weekend, which is a nice reward, but they have what's called the chaos shuffle, which all of your perks are randomized.
2613516	2618622	which sounds silly, but it's actually really fun because if you're playing survivor, then guess what?
2618622	2621065	The killer's perks are randomized too.
2621065	2630636	So you don't get people that are able to go in there with super sweaty builds that are, you know, tailored a certain way to like, you know, like people are kind of forced to play the game.
2631892	2632852	as the game.
2632852	2635813	And it's um, I know it sounds really weird, but it's true.
2635813	2642234	It makes sense if you play this game a lot, trust me, and you you run into some very interesting builds that are meant to troll a little bit.
2642234	2644395	It forces people to play the game the way it's meant to be played.
2644395	2648035	And I think a lot of people are actually really enjoying it.
2648035	2649296	Myself, one of them.
2649296	2651236	So that's my gaming week.
2651236	2655597	A lot of familiar stuff, but you know, good stuff, important stuff.
2656411	2658272	Alright, we're going to move on.
2658272	2661534	We are going to get into this next topic here.
2661534	2668258	This is usually the part of the show where we kind of talk about housekeeping before we get into the actual news of the week.
2668258	2676903	And we talk about things going on with the show and all of that good stuff, including I should mention here, again, we are not going to be here next week.
2676903	2678084	We will be here in two weeks.
2678544	2684406	I am going out to Chicago to see friends, maybe play video games too, but I'll be back in two weeks.
2684406	2690228	I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura will be here putting content out, and of course Bobby, I believe, is still live next week too.
2690228	2692749	I think we're doing a stream day on Saturday.
2692749	2695210	Nice, nice.
2695210	2699071	And Bonds006, on that note with DVD, wait.
2699071	2701792	We'll get to the other DVD announcements a little later on in the show, I promise.
2702412	2710073	But anyway, on a serious note, though, I wanted to mention something else that's a little bit close to the show family and our hearts here.
2710073	2711854	Loki, do you want to kind of talk about this a little bit?
2711854	2713474	What's going on?
2713474	2715194	Yeah, so I can talk about it.
2715194	2720875	It's so Eddie from Starboard Power Coupling.
2720875	2730477	He's been dealing with quite a bit of stuff recently dealing with cancer and trying to
2731998	2739747	Not only battling stage 4 colon cancer, but taking care of his mom as well.
2739747	2751160	And of course he's run into a bit of a rough patch right now being out of work for so long, just trying to basically support himself to, you know,
2752165	2757449	Keep a house, you know, a roof over his head and that type of stuff, you know, treatments and all that.
2757449	2766977	So my wife and Irene have set up a co-fi or coffee.
2766977	2770840	Some of you old school OLR listeners will recognize a lot of these names.
2770840	2772961	You'll recognize Princess Irene from back in the day.
2772961	2774403	We used to host a show together.
2775023	2776525	when this was on live 365.
2776525	2780749	If anybody remembers Outside the Box, that show is probably like 18 years old at this point.
2780749	2782531	Irene and I host that show together.
2782531	2787276	And Eddie was a guest on multiple of these shows.
2787276	2790380	But yeah, most recently will be known to all of you from Starboard Power Coupling.
2790380	2790520	Yeah.
2791974	2802837	Yeah, so there's a coffee, I guess it's coffee is how you pronounce that, set up for, you know, the fundraising of that.
2802837	2819301	And so if you go to ko-fi.com, that's ko-fi.com slash we love Eddie, E-D-D-Y, you can go there and donate if you can to just help them out because, you know,
2820001	2824006	He's really in a rough spot right now, so anything we can do to help him would be great.
2835198	2837680	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2850709	2857534	You know, many of you every week are very good about, you know, giving bits, giving subs, and we really appreciate that.
2857534	2865340	And if you have those kind of pockets tonight, and you want to say thank you in a special way, this is a great way that you can do it.
2865340	2869783	And we really appreciate it, you know, helping our friend Eddie through just
2871829	2873450	a horrible, you know, fuck cancer.
2873450	2874251	That's all I have to say.
2874251	2874751	Fuck it.
2874751	2878033	Like just a horrible thing that people shouldn't have to deal with.
2878033	2880214	Especially at his age.
2880214	2885017	But yeah, so I appreciate Thank you, pop culture wasn't much but was thank you.
2885017	2885718	Thank you for that.
2885718	2888259	No, I anything is huge.
2888259	2897425	Even if you you know, again, I know you you get hit with like, multiple of these a week on the internet, even just helping to spread the word and all that.
2897425	2898385	Super appreciated.
2898385	2900767	So thank you all so much and really appreciate it.
2902685	2904567	Anything else you want to say on that Loki?
2904567	2905629	No, that's it.
2905629	2906810	Right.
2906810	2911537	Well, let's move on and talk about what else is going on in the gaming industry.
2911537	2916143	So Loki, I will turn it over to you for our first story tonight.
2916909	2918390	Well, this is good and bad news.
2918390	2939548	I mean, we kind of figured this was what was going to happen with Grand Theft Auto 6, but it has been confirmed, though, thanks to Take-Two's latest earnings report that the Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to come out fall of 2025 and it's supposed to hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.
2940168	2951252	They said our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games previously established window of calendar 2025 to fall of calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto 6.
2951252	2957874	We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience and full of monetization.
2957874	2961556	I added that last part because that is exactly what they're going to do.
2961556	2964797	They they got to make up for those years development.
2966424	2976850	They love them some Grand Theft Auto Online shark cards, and you better believe that they are going to be monetizing the hell out of this.
2976850	2992337	Along with that, though, of course, there was an IGN interview with Strauss Zelnick, and they impressed him on what made them decide to, you know, that Roll7 and Intercept Games to use
2994730	2996872	What made them shut them down?
2996872	3006220	And Zelnick said, we didn't shutter those studios, we've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.
3006220	3009563	And then they pushed, you know, for more definitive answer.
3009563	3017010	And then that's when a PR rep stepped in and say, oh, you know, referred back to their company's cost of reduction plan.
3017665	3026077	So they're not, weirdly enough, they are not saying whether they closed those studios or not, despite the fact that studios is like, yeah, they closed.
3026077	3029302	You know, there's evidence that we've been shut down.
3029302	3031105	Like.
3031105	3031906	Why?
3031906	3032727	Like, I don't understand.
3034781	3047169	And then with that, apparently in the Rockstar PC launcher code, it was spotted that a PC version of Red Dead Redemption, the first one was inside of there.
3047169	3051191	So there had some descriptions for the game.
3051191	3052832	Yeah, they had product promotion.
3052832	3056275	It's talking about like, you know, zombie.
3056275	3059417	Was it the zombie uprising DLC?
3059417	3061278	And then also talking about Red Dead Redemption.
3061278	3061398	So
3062273	3066235	I guess that means that we're getting Red Dead Redemption on PC as well.
3066235	3072618	Maybe because we haven't we haven't gotten to the second one's been on PC forever, but up the first one.
3072618	3073719	So let's see.
3075814	3076555	Could be interesting.
3076555	3077836	I can't wait for the mods.
3077836	3080658	Just like with the second one, there's been some hilarious stuff out there.
3080658	3098151	So exactly, you know, this, this does, you know, going back to the Grand Theft Auto six, um, part of this story, it's interesting because in a way, I kind of feel like this ties into what we talked about at the top of the show tonight, because I, I do truly believe Grand Theft Auto six is a system seller of, because this game will not be on PS4, correct?
3098151	3101293	It is a PS5 and Series X and PC game.
3101293	3103535	Well, and not PC out the gate either, right?
3103735	3104876	Yeah, they're not PC.
3104876	3105976	I'm waiting for PC.
3105976	3113340	So Grand Theft Auto 6 will be a system seller.
3113340	3118162	And so it's very interesting that this is on the horizon.
3118162	3120644	Maybe Sony's been waiting and waiting for this and Microsoft too.
3122023	3137413	I, I hate, I don't want to sound like a fanboy or bias, but I really do feel like PlayStation will benefit more than Xbox, just because I feel like this series has always existed mainly in people know it associated with PlayStation and people just kind of tie the name to it.
3137413	3138914	And it has a lot of that name recognition.
3138914	3149461	And I really do think Sony will probably benefit from this a little more than Microsoft, unless Microsoft plays their cards right with the marketing, puts it on Game Pass, LOL, JK, that would never happen.
3149461	3151323	But, um, you know, does not a right way.
3152525	3154109	I really think PlayStation would benefit more
3158464	3161166	It'd be interesting if they do the cross buy with that.
3161166	3164708	I don't think a lot of third, I don't know how many third party games do that.
3164708	3168151	But like if they, you know, you buy it on Xbox, you get it on Xbox.
3168151	3172293	Grand Theft Auto has to do none of those nice things to be able to sell oodles and oodles.
3172293	3172714	No.
3172714	3174575	So yeah, they won't.
3174575	3184422	But I do think this is the system seller that ironically, to loop back to the top of the show, I think there are going to be people that are like, Okay, I'm going to get a PlayStation 5 now just to play this game.
3184422	3187043	And maybe this is why we have these rumors of the PlayStation 5 Pro.
3188024	3193087	and the refresh, which in turn will bring down the prices of the original PlayStation fives.
3193087	3196768	If they make them both concurrently, they may not.
3196768	3198890	It'll be very interesting to see what happens with all this.
3198890	3204252	So next year, I mean, it's a long time to wait if you're Sony, but.
3204252	3207074	I think they're going to move a lot of consoles next year.
3207074	3217519	So, yeah, I would just say if you're looking to pick up PlayStation five, maybe just wait a little bit longer to see what see what shakes out towards the end of the year, too, because, you know, there's probably going to be refreshes coming
3218322	3220466	Pretty soon, I would imagine.
3220466	3222750	We may even hear some announcements of those pretty soon.
3222750	3223892	So, I don't know.
3223892	3224693	Wait until the end of summer.
3225406	3230230	Ranma in chat says there is no need for a PS5 Pro or an Xbox Series X Pro.
3230230	3235734	Well, if rumors would be believed, a PlayStation 5 Pro is coming.
3235734	3236815	You know what, though?
3236815	3247443	If this game in particular has technical advancements on a PS5 Pro, that will absolutely be a selling point for a PS5 Pro.
3247443	3250165	Absolutely.
3250165	3251586	This is going to be that big of a game.
3254170	3260053	unless word gets out that it's Garbaggio and has microtransactions out the wazoo.
3260053	3261994	I kind of I kind of think it won't matter.
3261994	3263795	I think tons of people are still going to buy.
3263795	3265016	I don't think it will be garbage.
3265016	3266136	I think to be.
3266136	3269338	Yeah, I think it's probably saying it'll be like Grand Theft Auto 5.
3269338	3273760	I imagine single player, no microtransactions online.
3273760	3275081	All the microtransactions.
3275081	3279063	Prepare your wallet because it's going to be a transaction fest.
3279063	3279203	Yeah.
3280489	3285354	Alright, well, if that is a game that is not up your alley, perhaps this game would be.
3285354	3293403	Now, I should stress this is still in a rumor status, but it's one of those, you know, apparently where there's smoke, there's fire.
3293403	3300690	And it appears that hundreds of players may be already participating in a closed alpha of Valve's next game.
3301311	3304393	And it is called Deadlock.
3304393	3307895	This has apparently been in the works since 2018.
3307895	3313618	IceFrog is apparently the developer behind the game who made an original Dota mod.
3313618	3317740	Or I'm sorry, that's the individual, or I don't know if that's an individual or a company that's in charge.
3317740	3322743	But it's not uncommon for Valve to take mod makers and have them make full games.
3322743	3324484	That actually happens a lot over at Valve.
3325825	3331988	Apparently, Neon Prime was the original name of this project, and now it's known as Deadlock.
3331988	3341712	It's been reported by both Tyler McVicker, who is a veteran Valve reporter, and a content creator named Gabe Follower, which, you know, would know a thing or two about Valve, I assume.
3341712	3346835	They have both, through independent means, confirmed this is happening and it's in an advanced state of development.
3347455	3349116	Valorant, Overwatch, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2
3362845	3370892	So I think even though a lot of people are reporting that this is very similar to Overwatch, it sounds like there is a lane battle mechanic in this game that's very similar to Dota.
3370892	3379180	So it actually kind of brings Smite to mind, which is a third person lane game, but a shooter, which Smite is not.
3379180	3383223	So it could be a very interesting sort of medium.
3383223	3384925	E3VL says so Marvel rivals.
3385305	3389796	Yeah, it is interesting that all of these Overwatch competitors are coming up at once.
3389796	3394005	It's almost like Overwatch has exposed its weak point.
3395084	3395624	Overwatch 2
3416477	3419299	I mean, is Valve really stealing or are they buying them off themselves?
3419299	3420740	You can't do Team Fortress 3.
3420740	3422642	You got to make a new IP so we can do Team Fortress 3.
3422642	3423342	I know, right?
3423342	3424103	I know, right?
3424103	3426105	This isn't Team Fortress 3.
3426105	3428967	It's definitely, yeah, SSJ1 had that.
3428967	3430108	Get that clear.
3430108	3432630	Deadlock, parentheses, totally not Team Fortress 3.
3432630	3434211	Totally not.
3435199	3435539	Team Fortress 2
3458450	3461151	Yeah, but goes on sale a lot.
3461151	3464552	So I don't know, we'll see how much this actually costs.
3464552	3471754	But I have a good feeling it may be in the free to play or super cheap sort of realm, like $20 type of realm.
3471754	3475295	Comparisons as well the Bioshock Infinite and the Skyhook system.
3475295	3478336	So when we say like fantasy steampunk, think that sort of thing.
3478336	3480077	So that's something that could be very interesting.
3480976	3485620	Of course, around the corner is our E3 Memorial Announcement Week.
3485620	3488682	What a good time that would be to announce something like this, wouldn't it?
3488682	3491865	Especially if you're in a closed alpha right now.
3491865	3493366	The plot thickens.
3493366	3495527	So all right, we'll see.
3495527	3496068	Moving on, Loki.
3497680	3499061	Uh, yes.
3499061	3504485	So something I've been dealing with is Fallout 4 constantly updating thanks to Bethesda.
3504485	3507066	The problem is they're not really fixing things.
3507066	3526379	So Bethesda, of course, launched their next gen update on April 25th that was supposed to bring, you know, you know, 60 FPS gameplay and, you know, better visuals on console and then on PC also kind of similar type of stuff, adding more
3528237	3531119	visual flair to the game.
3531119	3534842	The problem is there's mods that did that way better.
3534842	3541167	And because they patched it, it broke all those mods as well.
3541167	3545951	And on top of that, the patch itself still was bugged as well.
3545951	3556560	It also didn't fix any or fix some of the issues that they've been having from the get go and added even more issues that needed to be fixed.
3557100	3562185	Now follow that up with on May 13th, the next gen update 2.
3562185	3565968	It's their patch for their patch to fix some issues.
3565968	3567049	And guess what?
3567049	3570032	It's still not fixing all these issues.
3570032	3573114	However, on console, though, it has.
3573855	3582099	apparently caused some more crashes on PlayStation 5, including a annoying red texture bug that has been fixed.
3582099	3583220	So that's good.
3583220	3586001	And oh, I'm sorry, fewer crashes on PlayStation 5.
3586001	3588263	So at least it's fixing stuff on console.
3588263	3592865	But on PC, though, it is actually breaking.
3592865	3597107	You know, it's still quests are broken.
3597107	3601450	You know, it's lacking ultra wide screen options on PC.
3602904	3612212	It's almost like they're using a really old engine and they can't figure out how to program a good game because Starfield, perfect example.
3612212	3618138	So funny enough, players on PC have been kind of begging Bethesda.
3618138	3620160	Can you please stop patching the game?
3620160	3622402	Just leave it alone.
3622402	3623923	Just leave it be.
3623923	3626185	Let us be able to play the game like we want to.
3626185	3627206	You're not making it better.
3627206	3627967	You're making it worse.
3629020	3633905	How often in gaming's history do you hear a fanbase go, please stop patching your game?
3633905	3636127	Please stop making improvements.
3636127	3637849	You're not improving.
3637849	3645176	If you don't, if you don't improve your game, if you make it worse by patching it, then yeah, maybe maybe don't.
3646638	3647298	do that?
3647298	3655681	Or maybe you know, here's an idea since these, you know, patches in like, quality of life improvements have been out there in mod form already.
3655681	3662344	Like, why didn't they take some of that and incorporate that into the game to optimize those people?
3662344	3665545	I'm gonna guess I don't know.
3665545	3667586	I mean, they paid someone to develop this stuff.
3667586	3667846	So
3669857	3675705	SheHulk10 does point out, still in its current state, Fallout 4 is a great game to play.
3686599	3701089	And then, of course, as a bit of a surprise, Epic Games has announced with a teaser image on their social media that Fortnite Battle Royale is getting Fallout content.
3701089	3703071	What that is?
3703071	3707334	No idea, but it is something that, you know, probably cosmetics
3708086	3711289	But there is a teaser image of it, so we're going to have to wait and see.
3711289	3716554	Would that be maybe TV show related, like specific characters in the TV show?
3716554	3717255	I don't know.
3717255	3720718	It doesn't look like TV show content, at least to the screenshot.
3720718	3724622	But I mean, maybe.
3724622	3726423	Because apparently TV shows doing great.
3726423	3729646	So, you know, tie in that way, too.
3729646	3730707	Who knows?
3730707	3731108	Possibly.
3732110	3739054	All right, well, let's talk about something pretty cool for accessibility that's happening over at Microsoft.
3739054	3743737	It's a brand new controller that is going to be on the way out called the Proteus controller.
3743737	3746078	I think I hope I hope I'm saying that right.
3746078	3747499	Yeah, but this controller
3748239	3761042	is gonna ship in the fall for $299, and I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but this is pretty cool what this controller can do, because it's actually something that is made to improve accessibility a little bit.
3761042	3771865	And if you actually look at some of the screenshots of this thing, and for those of you that are watching live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, I'll show you some pictures from this article I'm looking at that actually show you how this controller, it kind of looks like
3772225	3775149	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3790189	3810786	And that's really good news if you're a one-handed gamer or potentially a player with disabilities or limited a Disability or limited mobility you could actually use this in a different configuration So for example, you see a screenshot there for those that are watching live where all the cubes are kind of in a line but you could also arrange it in this sort of way where it's a little bit more like a cube and so it's like the
3811847	3821289	Like the little controller analog stick is on the side and like your trigger buttons are on top, you know, you could do this a little bit of a different way.
3821289	3823310	Everything on this is remappable.
3823310	3827110	You do have to use a companion app to do it, but it will work.
3827110	3833552	At launch, it will only work with the Series X and S systems as well as Xbox One and Windows 10 and 11.
3834452	3836674	If you want to pre-order this, you can get a discount, $255.
3850026	3855528	It actually comes with a charging cable, unlike a lot of things right now in this day and age, if you want to pick that up.
3855528	3857088	And that's pretty cool.
3857088	3871633	Also, this is in addition to you may remember that Microsoft is already kind of at the forefront of a lot of these sort of accessibility things because there is that $99 adaptive controller and that was released in 2018.
3871633	3874874	That controller is soon going to support more accessories.
3874874	3879295	USB ports will support up to 12 buttons, a second stick and a hat switch.
3879935	3883480	So, uh, firmware switch is coming out in the next couple of weeks, it's said.
3883480	3892352	So, you know, always nice to hear about things that are happening on that sort of development front to help more people be able to play games because gaming is for everyone.
3892352	3895656	Even I, I just kind of, I mean, I don't know if I would pay
3896752	3897593	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
3921172	3931459	So I like the little, I don't know what they are on there, but they're kind of like the the covers for the other like for the parts that you're not using.
3931459	3935481	I like how it has like little logos or graphics on there.
3935481	3937563	It's kind of cool to like customize that stuff as well.
3937563	3941766	So it's like it's an accessibility controller, but at least that you can make it look cool, too.
3943136	3949958	Martello4 in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, it could be something that changes the way you game with a controller.
3949958	3958180	Yeah, it kind of makes me think about like those, those trackball people out there, which DarkSakura is one of them, by the way, you know, she's talked about her love of the trackball here.
3958180	3960501	And some people use it for ergonomic reasons as well.
3960501	3963882	It kind of makes me think of that, that like so often we talk about mouse and keyboard, mouse and keyboard.
3964242	3969583	If you're a trackball person, that like changes a lot, like the inverted mouse sort of thing, right?
3969583	3974824	So it kind of makes me think of that, that yeah, this could actually change the way you think about controllers.
3974824	3982246	Again, whether that's an accessibility thing for you, or it's just kind of a neat way to reconfigure something.
3982246	3987567	So yeah, or as pod culture wants me to say, a rad way to configure something there.
3987567	3987707	So.
3989281	3989841	All right.
3989841	3992202	Anyway, all for those new controllers.
3992202	3997725	And yeah, that would be Microsoft's second venture into this realm for this particular cycle of consoles.
3997725	3998666	So I think that's cool.
3998666	4008270	And it is, to be fair, it is this other company making it kind of like for Microsoft, which is a little different, but still very cool.
4008270	4013213	Loki, this is a very interesting follow up to something we were talking about quite a bit last week.
4014102	4016645	Arcane Austin shut down due to bug fixes for Redfall
4030922	4035366	However, Arkane Austin has actually said, Thank you for your support of messages.
4035366	4044955	We are working to release our final update, the game update for that will bring revamped neighborhood, nest system, single player pausing, offline mode and more.
4044955	4047677	More will provide additional details soon.
4047677	4048458	Thank you all.
4048458	4054724	So apparently we are going to be getting that final patch, which is nice because then it might make the game playable.
4054724	4055444	Here's my question.
4055444	4057266	Will you play it?
4057266	4057346	No.
4058283	4065005	So I'm kind of curious without the studio being out there to really market this game, it's going to be interesting to see how this is promoted.
4065005	4072748	I would imagine they're going to try to really get people through Game Pass and try to point this out as a perk of Game Pass, you know, especially with, you know, some of the games.
4072748	4075549	Play games for studios we've closed down.
4075549	4077850	You know, there's these hot, hot rumors out there.
4079131	4079692	Call of Duty
4096753	4101900	I used to be a guy that used to play Call of Duty's campaigns and Call of Duty is fun.
4101900	4108629	Like it used to be fun when we can kind of do like LAN stuff with it and like just play in a small group of friends.
4108629	4111433	But I don't want to play with randos on the Internet.
4111433	4111714	Like it's.
4113876	4119982	That time is long gone, unfortunately, because I haven't played Call of Duty in forever.
4119982	4122865	And it just isn't the game that it used to be.
4122865	4125367	And also, I don't play a single player campaign anymore.
4125367	4128009	I'm just not interested in Call of Duty anymore.
4128009	4131212	But yeah, can I not pay the upcharge for Call of Duty?
4131212	4132613	Can that be its own tier, please?
4132613	4139540	Well, quite honestly, if they up the price of Game Pass, I'm going to really consider cutting back from Ultimate, which is what I have now, to just PC.
4140945	4145540	Yeah, that's the thing is like I'm not using it at all and every month, you know?
4145540	4145740	Yeah.
4147014	4148675	So, but, but I mean, I don't know.
4148675	4152037	I, I might, I just feel like my gaming backlog is so fucking big right now.
4152037	4153658	I have so many games to catch up on.
4153658	4162923	I would be curious about Redfall offline mode, but I just, realistically, am I going to get to it when I can't stop playing the same fucking games for the past, like five years?
4162923	4163543	I don't know.
4163543	4163904	I don't know.
4163904	4165544	But I think it's neat that it's happening.
4165544	4166945	It's just, I don't know.
4166945	4171388	It's, it's weird that it's, it's like, it kind of sucks the studio closed.
4171388	4173469	You like want to be happy that this is coming.
4173829	4196493	but at the same time it's like oh but the people that made it aren't there anymore so like yeah I mean perfect example like Volition like it sucks that they closed because their last few games were kind of terrible but like there was somebody there at one time that was working on a patch for Saints Row 2 that would have been awesome if it ever did release for PC this was a fix like
4197205	4202209	All of these things that were broken with it and then we're never going to get that.
4202209	4203350	That's never coming.
4203350	4209575	Rama in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says just use discount codes for game pass four months for 30 bucks.
4209575	4211957	Hell yeah, I sort of did.
4211957	4217082	I bought I bought Xbox cards at Costco, which you can get $90 worth of cards for 100 bucks.
4218743	4222365	or no, that would that would not be a good deal other way.
4222365	4225827	I should not play deal or no deal because I would not be good at it.
4225827	4229389	Other way around you get $100 worth of cards for 90 bucks at Costco.
4229389	4231271	And I think I did something with that.
4231271	4237834	I think I just paid for like a year, which you know, the more the more you buy up front, the less a hit it is to your wallet.
4237834	4237975	So
4238775	4253361	But I also like to use the redeem the rewards but it's it's so much harder to do the rewards now I am not as actively checking the rewards because I don't use my Series X as much as I used to ever since I got a better computer.
4253361	4257363	Once I got a computer that was just as good as the modern consoles.
4257363	4261625	I've really not been playing my consoles a lot unless it's an exclusive.
4261625	4264987	Have I been playing my PlayStation 5 since Final Fantasy 16?
4264987	4266807	Honestly, not really.
4266807	4268068	A little bit, but not really.
4270080	4277010	Alright, we are going to take a trip back to a time before offline when all games were offline.
4277010	4282497	Okay, actually, maybe this particular one, you might have had a modem mode.
4282497	4284640	But most of this was offline.
4284640	4285582	So let's get to the segment.
4296181	4303945	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vaults and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4303945	4306447	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4307284	4315069	Alright, but since DarkSakura isn't here tonight, she's away at the Pinball Expo, I am gonna step in and do the Classic Game of the Week.
4315069	4333101	And I picked a real old one from the archives, but I think this is one... I don't know how many of you are gonna know this one, and I really hope you do, because I think this led to an entire series of games that probably still sits on the shelf at Target that I don't know how much y'all pay attention to.
4333101	4334222	So you ready for this?
4334222	4336704	Here it is, the Classic Game of the Week is...
4337484	4341048	Hoyle's Book of Games Volume 1
4356946	4359367	but there have been tons and tons of games in this series.
4359367	4362808	It started, I actually played this one that we're taking a look at tonight.
4362808	4367970	That was the very first game that came out in 1996, but there've been a ton of games in this series.
4367970	4371611	There was a volume two, there was a volume three, which was also very good.
4371611	4373032	Then there was a volume four.
4373032	4381215	And then at that point, once Sierra put out four games, a new company called Encore Inc came in and took over the license and started putting out
4381775	4382155	Tons.
4382155	4384678	There's like at least 20 of these types of games.
4384678	4388521	And you probably have seen these games like sitting on the shelf of Target.
4388521	4396488	Like, you know, Hoyle Puzzle Board Games and Hoyle Mahjong and Hoyle Card Puzzle and Board Games from 2013.
4396488	4401072	And there was a Hoyle Card Game on the Game Boy Color and all of that.
4401072	4401793	So, um,
4403120	4407262	You probably have picked up some type of Hoil game at some point in the past.
4407262	4408563	I think I played this game.
4408563	4411124	It looks familiar, but I don't remember.
4411124	4413445	It is a blast from the past.
4413445	4417347	And yeah, I knew Bobby Blackwolf would know this one because I know he knows his Sierra.
4417347	4418808	And this was this.
4418808	4422490	If you had a Roland MT-32, like I know he did.
4422490	4424671	This is, you know, it had the soundtrack to go with it.
4425131	4433434	And those of you that are watching the game live on Twitch right now we're playing the gameplay, you'll notice some of the characters in the game are Sierra characters.
4433434	4436035	So you actually have Graham from King's Quest.
4436035	4443078	And I believe that is Rosalina and that might be Larry Laffler from Leisure Suit Larry.
4443078	4446919	So there were some game there were some characters from Sierra Games.
4446919	4450561	Apparently there were some characters in there that were actually based off Sierra staff.
4451081	4458024	And I never knew that until I did the research for tonight, is that some of that was actually Sierra staff.
4458024	4460966	Bobby in chat says, this is the only Hoyle game I played.
4460966	4462286	I didn't need any of the others.
4462286	4465448	Dude, you're missing out like two and three and four.
4465448	4468749	The other Sierra ones, especially two and three.
4468749	4472111	Three was great because three had all the board games in it.
4472611	4490736	which I'll talk again I want to focus on one tonight but we'll get into two and three just because I don't know when we'll ever get a chance to feature this series again and it is like a I think these are games that are like I shouldn't be telling you that these are games that you could play for free online at the archive.org online thing but
4491736	4493037	WinkNudge, okay?
4493037	4496440	So... And honestly, you should check it out.
4496440	4499902	Because again, look at what this series led to.
4499902	4503085	Now there's all these types of card and board games that are out there.
4503085	4508609	But yes, I played the shit out of this game because this actually had a game in it.
4508609	4512672	So there were six games in the original Volume 1.
4512672	4516055	Crazy Eights, which you're seeing on the screen now, Old Maid,
4516795	4531508	Hearts, JinRummy, Klondike, which is what most people just know as Solitaire, and then Kribbage was the key game for me because, and I think I've talked about this on the show before, Kribbage was a game that my grandpa taught me how to play.
4531508	4533210	And it's a little bit of a niche game.
4533210	4535892	It is a little bit of a retirement home type of game.
4535892	4541617	But I've actually, I kind of remember how to play Kribbage.
4542398	4544380	But I don't think I remember completely.
4544380	4549925	And I think if I were to go play a game like this online, it would remind me very easy how to play it.
4549925	4555349	In fact, even watching the YouTube of the people playing tonight kind of reminded me, oh, that's right.
4555349	4560554	You deal six cards, then you pick two cards to go in the dealer's crib so that they have like the secret hand.
4560874	4574145	And then you do the playing and you play to 31 and then there's like the 15.2, 15.4, you know, you count your points and all the points are tabulated on those infamous cribbage boards that look like the, you know, like swirlies and they had different modifiers for cribbage boards over the years.
4574145	4574506	But anyway.
4576447	4579991	I got really into cribbage because that's something that my grandpa taught me how to play.
4579991	4584855	So the fact that I could play this on my PC was really cool.
4584855	4586957	And Bobby Blackwell said, this is how I learned cribbage.
4586957	4587337	Yes.
4587337	4590440	And RecordWN says, oh, like the playing card company.
4590440	4592702	Yes, that's where it comes from.
4592702	4598627	So the series is named after Edmund Hoyle, who was a playing card expert.
4598627	4602511	There are also trademarks and designs from the Hoyle brand of playing cards,
4602791	4609474	which were licensed under Brown and Bigelow, which is the company that I guess held them when this game first came out.
4609474	4613276	So yeah, the opponents kind of had their own personas.
4613276	4616358	And you could play these different types of games in there.
4616358	4620440	And the characters that you're playing against would actually comment along the way.
4620440	4626663	For example, Larry Lafler would comment about women because you know, it was this is a game of a different time.
4626663	4628324	So he would make you know, those types of comments.
4628784	4633206	and other characters and some of you have been pointing out in chat Roger Wilco is in the game.
4633206	4634506	Yep.
4634506	4635846	Characters from Police Quest.
4635846	4636046	Yep.
4636046	4636907	Yep.
4636907	4639808	So Roger Wilco would say he wants to go out and save the universe again.
4639808	4641768	Yeah, all of that.
4641768	4653332	The game was originally developed by Warren Schwader, who actually took the concept to Ken Williams, who I believe ended up being a producer on this game of the infamous duo of Ken and Roberta Williams.
4653332	4656393	Warren ended up being the lead programmer and the game designer.
4656913	4664236	And if it looks like other Sierra online games, that's because this game was made with SCI, Sierra Creative Interpreter.
4664236	4674541	SCI was supposed to be made to do adventure games like King's Quest and, you know, that's why they all felt a little bit familiar as they were all done in SCI, but this game was done in SCI as well.
4674541	4678223	And it was a little bit of a challenge because you had to do AI for the different characters and all that.
4679144	4695861	Warren actually continued as the lead programmer and game designer for the next two games in the series, and Rob Atislap, I hope I said that right, was the composer and sound designer for those same games, which is why I think this series kind of changed when you started to get into the fourth game.
4697765	4699746	because the creative minds behind it changed.
4699746	4705931	I'm not saying they were bad, but it just kind of like they don't, the games beyond three were not as memorable to me.
4705931	4707452	That's just what it is.
4707452	4709694	This game sold a quarter of a million copies by 1990.
4709694	4714977	I will mention briefly some of the other games that came later, but I will mention those in chat too.
4714977	4720121	Some folks in chat are saying like, oh yeah, this looks like Vegas Steaks.
4720121	4721542	Who said that it was Vegas Steaks?
4721542	4722322	Because that was a very
4723984	4726907	Martell04, RemindsMeOfVegasSteaks
4741004	4748949	that also I think probably drew inspiration from that, because I think that was a HAL Laboratories game, which Vegas Stakes ended up being as well.
4748949	4752011	I wonder if somebody in chat will remember, what was the original NES game?
4752011	4754813	It had like, you walked around a casino and played Blackjack or something.
4754813	4757394	I think Vegas Stakes was also heavily inspired by that.
4757394	4761797	But like all great video games, they all end up inspiring each other.
4761797	4763038	Was it Vegas Dream?
4763038	4764379	Thank you, OrangeRite, that does sound right.
4764379	4766020	Vegas Dream, I think that is right.
4766020	4767841	So we'll highlight that game another week.
4769662	4772223	But yeah, I don't know how much else there is to say about this game.
4772223	4776304	I guess I could talk about a couple of the other games in the Hoyle series real quick.
4776304	4781226	Hoyle Book of Games Volume 2 went up to 28 games.
4781226	4794531	I won't name them all because they get a little obscure, kind of like some of the Nintendo Clubhouse Games collections, but Pyramid, Poker Square, Strategy, Flower Garden, Golf, so it gets a little, you know, in the weeds there.
4795071	4800014	But then when you get into Volume 3, it started to get into board games.
4800014	4813183	Volume 3 had Backgammon, Checkers, Dominoes, Yacht, which was the original Yahtzee, because Yahtzee is a trademark, Pachizi, and Snakes and Ladders, as opposed to Chutes and Ladders, because again, trademarks.
4813183	4815945	So that was all board games, which was fun.
4815945	4824311	And again, because it was from 91, and I think it was made in a different engine, you started to get more of the CD-ROM looking characters, but you still had Larry, you still had Graham, you still had Rosella.
4824651	4825592	You still had a lot of that.
4825592	4828713	It was actually split into good guys and bad guys, which I thought was interesting.
4828713	4838859	So then when they got into volume four, volume four was a remake of volume one, but with better graphics, basically.
4838859	4841120	So that's where the series started to go from there.
4841120	4844802	And then the the Hoyle games ended up everywhere.
4844802	4847664	So anyway, I loved this game.
4847664	4850145	I played a lot of this game and two and three.
4850145	4851006	To be fair, I play.
4851006	4852547	I remember buying all of these.
4852547	4852647	Well,
4853769	4854590	Let's be real.
4854590	4860814	I asked mommy and daddy very nicely if I got good grades to buy me these games, the first three in the series.
4860814	4861474	And I did.
4861474	4863195	I did have them all and I really loved them.
4863195	4865617	So that's why I've picked it for you all tonight.
4865617	4867678	So go forth.
4867678	4870220	My grandpa is, of course, no longer with us.
4870220	4871801	You can probably guess I'm in my 40s.
4871801	4874483	My grandpa's no longer with us.
4874483	4878285	Lucky you, if you are in your 40s, your grandpa still with you.
4878285	4880507	But he's moved on.
4880507	4883409	But the love of cribbage is something I will remember him by.
4884129	4892472	And yeah, if I if I can air a bit of a personal grievance, which I probably shouldn't do here on the show, but I'm going to anyway.
4892472	4897034	When my grandpa passed away, there was one thing that I wanted.
4897034	4899415	I wanted his old cribbage board.
4899415	4907598	And do you know that they let other friends of his come into the house first and take the things they wanted before they let some of the other family members come in the house take things they wanted?
4907598	4911119	My my understanding was they actually wanted to give me their car.
4912458	4914439	And I didn't even get that.
4914439	4917582	And I let me I want to stress this.
4917582	4919503	I didn't care about the fucking car.
4919503	4921144	I wanted the cribbage board.
4921144	4925768	And to this day, I'm still really salty that I didn't get that.
4926641	4933444	So, not to bring up too much personal drama, but some of these types of connections with games are really fucking important.
4933444	4934824	So, just putting it out there.
4934824	4941287	But anyway, all that aside, I can still enjoy Cribbage through Hoyle and other modern interpretations of it.
4941287	4944248	Although, honestly, I don't see Cribbage in a lot of modern games.
4944248	4948550	I don't even think it was in Nintendo's thing, if I remember right.
4948550	4950431	Um, was it not in, um...
4952247	4955749	the 3DS one I had or it might have been I don't think it was in the Switch one.
4955749	4956630	I don't know what it's called now.
4956630	4958731	The Switch one, Clubhouse.
4958731	4959391	Clubhouse Games.
4959391	4959911	Yeah.
4959911	4964013	Well, there was the original Clubhouse Games and there was they called it something else for the Switch.
4964013	4964494	But yeah.
4964494	4966254	Worldwide Classics or something like that.
4966254	4966755	That's it.
4966755	4967035	That's right.
4967035	4968195	Because it was games around the world.
4968195	4968916	That's what it was.
4968916	4969416	Yeah, you're right.
4969416	4972017	It was Worldwide Classics.
4972017	4973218	Does it list the games?
4973218	4973818	It does not.
4973818	4975059	Because why would we do that?
4975199	4978780	PodCulture in chat says, I don't even know what the fuck Cribbage is.
4978780	4981601	Well, here's your chance to go learn.
4981601	4985822	Go to the game's archive, or if you can find a legit copy of this game, hey, go for it.
4985822	4989763	But let's be real, you're probably going to find this on an abandonware site somewhere.
4989763	4995304	Go forth and learn how to play because I think I skipped by it when I did the video, but let me go.
4995304	4996564	It's still playing on the other screen here.
4996564	5003386	And I believe actually in the very beginning, I think the person recording this YouTube also did not know how to play Cribbage.
5003786	5006307	So it actually does walk you through the rules.
5006307	5010708	Although at some point in the rules, it says there's more.
5010708	5017209	I think the last screen here says there's more information in the book because I and I get it.
5017209	5019190	It can't explain all of the different county.
5019190	5019790	There it is.
5019790	5024811	Please see Hoyle's Rules of Games for complete instructions.
5024811	5027252	So that was the copy protection.
5027252	5030693	The actual how to how to play the game fully was in the manual.
5032515	5037498	Oh, thank you, Matt, for that convenient link that I won't point out in chat, but it is there.
5037498	5038178	So.
5038178	5039419	All right.
5039419	5040640	That was your classic game of the week.
5040640	5042101	Hoyle's official book of games.
5042101	5043561	We're going to say volume one.
5043561	5049205	I know I touched on a little bit of the entire series tonight, because again, I don't know if I'll get a chance to do volume two and three later on.
5049205	5051806	But yeah, there you go.
5051806	5053227	Yeah, it does not have cribbage.
5054440	5055501	Involute.
5055501	5056701	Oh, no, not Clubhouse Games.
5056701	5057302	No, it doesn't.
5057302	5058743	No, no, no, it does not.
5058743	5061584	And it's also not in alphabetical order.
5061584	5063685	Thank you, Nintendo.
5063685	5064466	Why?
5064466	5065586	Why would you do this?
5065586	5067488	Yeah, they might.
5067488	5071030	Was it called Crib in another?
5071030	5072110	I think it's always been Cribbage.
5072110	5073751	I don't think that's a trademark name.
5073751	5078134	I think because like I think there's different companies that sell Cribbage boards.
5078134	5078254	So.
5079065	5090235	Anyway, where my cribbage fans at email the show participate at orange launch radio.com maybe maybe one of these days we'll do a tournament for charity.
5090235	5091677	All right.
5091677	5097362	Let's get to some other headlines in the segment we call rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on in the industry Loki.
5099044	5103971	Yeah, so the timing of this couldn't be any more perfect.
5103971	5113906	I think we were joking about video game product placement and stuff, and we mentioned Final Fantasy with Cup Noodles and stuff, and sure enough,
5114366	5121610	A few days later, Final Fantasy 14 players can unlock Mountain Zoo.
5121610	5122151	That's right.
5122151	5130195	It's a special mount that you can get in Final Fantasy and Zoo being, you know, a flying bird creature in the game.
5130195	5134798	Now there's Mountain Zoo that you can get by drinking Mountain Dew.
5134798	5143603	And along with that, yes, it's redeeming codes on the drink until up to July 14th is when they'll be available.
5144848	5147650	Um, cool.
5147650	5156657	This is not, this is not the first time Final Fantasy has done this, by the way, there was a promotion with Butterfinger a few years ago, you may or may not recall, and you could get a mount that way too.
5156657	5157697	So this is not new.
5157697	5161820	But by the way, this all ties into the Xbox promotion stuff.
5161820	5166483	And it's and trust me, I care because I play this game, there is no other way to get the mount and zoom out.
5166483	5171287	Now it is a recoloring of a mount that exists in the game already, as most of these tend to be, but I still want it.
5171547	5172367	Sparkling Citrus Refreshment Minion
5187302	5193148	As somebody who's diabetic, and I've been very open about that on the show, I have type 2, and my blood sugar numbers are great.
5193148	5197173	I lost weight, and no, I did not take the shot, but no shame if you had to.
5197173	5200717	Everybody does their weight loss journeys in different ways.
5200717	5206963	So I was lucky enough that with a lot, a lot of walking and changing my diet, I was able to get things under control.
5206963	5208785	For now, and that might change as I get older.
5209406	5215271	But my point is, Mountain Dew is like literally the worst fucking drink.
5215271	5219355	I do know how much sugar is in Mountain Dew, especially Mountain Dew Code Red.
5219355	5222578	Yeah, not good for you at all.
5222578	5228923	And you know, I understand there's a lot of people out there that are drinking it, what have you, but it is not good.
5228923	5230945	If you drink it in moderation, then whatever.
5230945	5233347	Now, you can find these
5234248	5240630	in bottles of Diet Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Zero, which are actually the zero drink.
5240630	5245872	But again, you don't want to drink too much of that, but I'm okay with drinking one of those every other day or so or whatever.
5245872	5249293	But we were at Walmart yesterday.
5249293	5255215	I don't know why, but sometimes we're bored and we went to Walmart, like we're living in another town in the middle of nowhere.
5255215	5257076	We were bored and we went to Walmart.
5257076	5257296	And the
5258616	5259497	No, actually, it was on Friday.
5259497	5260158	It wasn't yesterday.
5260158	5260898	On Friday, we were bored.
5260898	5265923	We went to Walmart, and I looked, and they had the Mountain Dew with all the codes.
5265923	5269146	They had the code reds, the code purples, the code greens.
5269146	5271668	They all have other names, but I don't know what they are.
5271668	5273550	So I just call them code purple and code orange.
5275359	5276139	They had all that.
5276139	5278360	They had zero Mountain Dew diets.
5278360	5281200	They had zero Mountain Dew, zero calories.
5281200	5285441	And I'm worried that those drinks are like the hardest ones to find, which sucks.
5285441	5286741	So that's all.
5286741	5288522	So I just feel a personal sense.
5288522	5290562	And Shane was like, well, just buy him anyway.
5290562	5291242	Give him to Alan.
5291242	5292763	I'm like, Alan's not going to drink him either.
5292763	5294723	He's he's trying to watch his intakes and all that.
5294723	5295923	He doesn't he doesn't want him.
5295923	5297264	He's like, well, pour him down the sink.
5297264	5302945	And I'm like, honestly, for this mount, I might have to do it unless Loki wants.
5302945	5304205	No, you don't even drink Mountain Dew either.
5304716	5306737	No, I don't like mom, do you?
5306737	5307597	You.
5307597	5310058	Oh, hey, DarkSakura, how are you?
5310058	5311279	I'm exhausted.
5311279	5314400	Yeah, I thought you weren't going to make it tonight.
5314400	5319822	I rushed home and there is pizza at home and I have a pizza and my muscles have hatred.
5319822	5320483	Oh, my gosh.
5320483	5320683	All right.
5320683	5322223	Well, I played so much pinball.
5322223	5323244	Let's catch up with you in a minute.
5323244	5328586	Let's finish Rapid Fire News and we'll come back and catch up on your pinball journey here real quick.
5328586	5332608	SG100 Matt in chat says, I remember Crystal Pepsi having 69 grams of sugar.
5332608	5332828	Nice.
5333568	5335909	uh, while that is nice, not really nice for your body.
5335909	5337069	No, no.
5337069	5341070	And again, I don't want to say, I don't want to be the first person to sit up here and go, you shouldn't drink Mountain Dew.
5341070	5341630	It's bad for you.
5341630	5345952	I mean, it is, but you can do everything in moderation, right?
5345952	5349553	Ice cream's bad for you too, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you not to eat it.
5349553	5350373	Eat it in moderation.
5350373	5351113	That's all.
5351113	5355974	But yeah, Mountain Dew is one of those things where even the Mountain Dew zero, I wouldn't drink all that in a day.
5355974	5361156	I would have like one bottle every few days, but I could still get the mountain a week if I could find them.
5362532	5364954	Anyway, let's do gelato.
5364954	5366356	And that was pretty yummy.
5366356	5369799	Oh, Mountain Dew flavored things is pretty good.
5369799	5373682	SSU 100 Matt says even Cookie Monster says he has cookies in moderation now.
5373682	5376224	Yes.
5376224	5377706	All right.
5377706	5379047	Loki.
5379047	5379427	What else?
5379427	5379628	Yes.
5380339	5392362	Yeah, in fact, if you have too much Mountain Dew, you might end up fat and flatulent like this character, Wario, who, of course, folks are saying, you know, expecting the next Mario movie, obviously.
5392362	5396943	And there's been a campaign online to try to get Danny DeVito to play Wario.
5396943	5399243	And he said, yeah, I would do it.
5399243	5400663	Just give me a call.
5400663	5402244	Hell yes.
5402244	5403464	And exactly.
5403464	5405485	Well, yes, that does my response.
5405485	5406565	Call him.
5406565	5407285	Call him now.
5409758	5410639	Make it happen, please.
5410639	5414121	Oh my god, if he couldn't be Detective Pikachu, at least give us this.
5414121	5417423	At least give us this, Nintendo.
5417423	5421166	I want to personally speak to Miyamoto and tell him this needs to happen.
5421166	5422727	This is a brilliant idea.
5422727	5423708	Please make this happen.
5423708	5433995	All right, speaking of Miyamoto and Nintendo, some classic Game Boy games have made their way onto the Nintendo Switch Online service this week, including games I really can't believe weren't already there.
5434395	5443938	So what better time to release them than fucking randomly in the middle of May to finally release Super Mario Land is available finally on yeah, right.
5443938	5445318	I saw you make that face, Loki.
5445318	5446439	That was the face.
5446439	5448099	That wasn't already there.
5448099	5448959	Yeah, I know.
5448959	5449259	Right.
5449259	5449860	So there it is.
5451800	5472419	and then Alleyway, which was also kind of a, it was a launch title, I remember I owned that game out the gate too, it's basically Breakout or Arkanoid without the, you know, graphics and the Moai statue, but it was basically that, is also available now, and Baseball is also there, which was an early Game Boy release, so those are all available as well.
5472419	5475482	Japan actually got an extra release, they got
5476223	5478606	Kairu no tame ni kane wa naru
5484417	5485577	boy or something like that.
5485577	5485937	Dang it.
5485937	5487818	Now I got to look it up because I forgot the name in a minute.
5487818	5489858	The frog for whom the bell tolls.
5489858	5491018	That's it.
5491018	5497159	The frog for whom the bell tolls is that game that is additional in Japan, which I actually had never heard of.
5497159	5498800	But it looked kind of neat.
5498800	5501600	But it looks like it is heavy on the Japanese text.
5501600	5505841	So that's probably why you're not going to see a release that over here in the US.
5505841	5510662	But again, you can get those Japanese games if you create a Japanese online account.
5510662	5512302	So something to think about.
5514288	5515729	Also, I think I have one more.
5515729	5516290	That's right.
5516290	5521295	If you want to play other classics, you can also check out the Taito Milestones collection.
5521295	5524438	Taito Milestones 3 is on its way out.
5524438	5528562	It is coming out on the Nintendo Switch in Winter 2024.
5528562	5537671	And again, for a Taito collection, I can't believe some of these games weren't already released, such as Bubble Bobble.
5539148	5548835	and Rainbow Islands, which are only two of the biggest IPs in their archive, but will finally make their way out with Taito Milestones 3.
5548835	5553518	Some other games too, Rastan Saga, which you probably have heard of that one too, is also be there.
5553518	5556700	Then some other ones, maybe a little less known, but maybe you know them.
5556700	5562805	Kodash is in the collection too, Champion Wrestler, RuneArc, and ThunderFox.
5563345	5566508	DarkSakura, I think now's a good time to talk to you about what happened over the weekend.
5585438	5595786	So I'm kind of feel inspired now because I have a translation of Kairi no Tame ni Kane wa Naru.
5595786	5600289	I have the, I don't know how it'll come across, but I could give it a try.
5600289	5602071	I like every part of it's translated.
5602071	5602771	Oh, that's pretty cool.
5602771	5606614	If it, if my copy still works, then I'll play it.
5606614	5608356	But yeah, pinball, so much pinball.
5608356	5611058	They had the, they showcased the Princess Bride.
5612258	5614319	with its incomplete code.
5614319	5618060	It was mean to me, but Dan had a really good play on it.
5618060	5621861	And like the Cliffs of Insanity and everything.
5621861	5635965	And some people might have heard my voice doing commentary on the semifinal and the finals tournaments going on in pinball.
5635965	5638046	The last couple of matches were pretty intense.
5640747	5642669	I also got to play John Wick
5653434	5662862	Um, what I played of it was really fun, honestly, but people are complaining that there is no mention of gun violence in it.
5662862	5666505	When like, hello, do you even know what this movie is?
5666505	5669427	But as a table, it's really fun to play.
5669427	5670628	I quite enjoyed it.
5670628	5675592	They probably still want to make sure that like family pizza places are willing to pick up the game and stuff like that.
5675592	5679035	I think I think it's they sanitized it to make it more marketable is what they did.
5680160	5685934	then I wonder why then you know Jersey Jack didn't do that for Godfather or Guns N' Roses.
5687441	5687761	Oh, yeah.
5687761	5692846	But anyway, I mean, we even brought a couple of ours like we brought Shadow.
5692846	5700993	I didn't realize it was ours when I played it because, you know, we cycle things out sometimes, but it has like a full on gun as the ball launch.
5700993	5705737	So, I mean, so did the original Guns N' Roses table that I'm thinking of because I love that table.
5705737	5707598	You had that at some point, too.
5707598	5707939	We did.
5707939	5709140	Now we have the new one.
5709140	5709920	The Jersey Jack.
5709920	5710321	Oh, right.
5710321	5711041	Jersey Jack did one.
5711041	5711842	Yeah.
5711842	5712663	I played Elton John.
5713806	5714787	I played the Super Mario Mushroom Kingdom
5735925	5738847	The little child-sized Gotleb one.
5738847	5740608	And I still want one.
5740608	5743410	I told Dan I want one because it's like my height.
5743410	5744791	You said the height of a hobbit.
5744791	5750294	You sent me promo for the ABBA table, too, which apparently is a huge ABBA banner.
5750294	5751235	Yeah, they didn't have the table.
5751235	5751975	It's not done yet.
5751975	5754697	But yeah, I think it's for sale, that huge ass banner.
5754697	5757239	But it would take like an entire wall.
5757239	5760461	I mean, I have some pretty I'll send you a picture of it.
5760461	5760861	But, um.
5761587	5772074	But yeah, they they actually had the remastered Funhaus, which I will never own another one of those in my life because of that stupid head.
5772074	5776137	They had a giant like symbol monkey.
5776137	5777058	You know what I'm talking about?
5777058	5777818	Oh, yeah.
5777818	5778459	Oh, yeah.
5778459	5779699	Glowing red eyes.
5779699	5782601	And he nearly I was going around the corner and I'd forgotten about it.
5782601	5786104	And I nearly get bapped in the head by a symbol by an evil giant monkey.
5786104	5786144	Um.
5790245	5795827	EnoBobby, I might suggest that Dan should consider getting Abba and storing Abba's dining room.
5795827	5797888	That's an expensive storage.
5797888	5800409	I appreciate the thought, but we do stuff like that, though.
5800409	5801770	It's a big, big thing.
5801770	5803451	It's like, hey, I got to move some stuff.
5803451	5808293	Can I keep a couple of pins at your place?
5808293	5810454	I really I played a lot of stuff like.
5812358	5816760	I actually got to take a little time to have a few rounds on Tommy.
5816760	5823464	Because the last few times I've tried to play one, it's been out of order, or there's been lines, or something.
5823464	5828287	So I really, really like how Tommy plays.
5828287	5829728	Of course, I'll play the Black Rose.
5829728	5838332	But as far as things, the big draw-in was the Funhouse... Oh, they had Queen?
5838332	5838973	I didn't play Queen.
5840215	5845669	But I did play Alien, which has been out for a little bit, but that table is so well done, it's so good.
5849891	5852831	So the big draw-ins were, of course, the tournament.
5852831	5856572	They had the semi-finals, and then the finals were today.
5856572	5860693	And then there was the women's tournament last night, which I didn't go to.
5860693	5869255	I was sitting outside in the camping area talking about pinball and who knows what else with some of the other regulars.
5869255	5871256	They had a free tiki bar.
5873526	5882970	I, however, I brought my own Guinness because apparently everybody just drinks IPAs and I don't know what's wrong with them.
5882970	5886672	And I mean, it was just like a really a really good time.
5886672	5887652	It was.
5887652	5892755	And this one this this year, I spent more time socializing, which is not normally my thing.
5892755	5893635	You know, it's good, though.
5894434	5908772	But I got to play what I wanted to play and I made some friends and I got to, you know, I sort of cross-promoted a little bit to get more folks onto the Elk Grove Pinball Twitch.
5908772	5910694	Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.
5910694	5911175	And I will...
5913127	5920271	Give a shout out if no one minds, but Elgrove Pinball has really been working with a lot of the other pinball groups in the area, too.
5920271	5922312	They broadcast the League Nights.
5922312	5925233	I may be at League Night on Thursday this week.
5925233	5926794	Oh, nice.
5926794	5929015	But just a bunch of really, really good folks.
5929015	5940781	And, you know, and they put a lot of effort into putting on the Golden State Pinball Festival every year and also work with a pentagogo that happens in Dixon that I don't go to because of corn pollen.
5943487	5946969	But it's just a really, really great group of people, really.
5946969	5958756	You get people all over the gamut of, you know, politics and religion and this, that, and the other, but the one thing they all come together over is pinball.
5958756	5967321	And I think that something like that is great, that we need to remember what we have in common with people and not so much what makes us different.
5967321	5971324	I mean, what makes us different makes us diverse, but, you know,
5972082	5985604	When you're looking at, like, a lot of people do us versus them and generalize about all the sides, much like they're doing with current events overseas.
5985604	5990745	But you have to take a moment and stop and think these are people.
5990745	5993766	And remember that you're dealing with people.
5993766	6001267	And find... If you're gonna reach somebody, the best way to do it is with an open, respectful discourse.
6003054	6010137	And I was very much reminded of the humanity of people during all of this.
6010137	6011237	Everyone was kind.
6011237	6017579	Everyone had, you know, would offer a seat around, you know, the little propane fire.
6017579	6021381	And it was that that really struck me about just how strong the community here is.
6021954	6022494	DragonCon 2019
6055938	6058059	DragonCon is the city of DragonCon.
6058059	6061442	It is not anything else playing into that.
6061442	6067488	Conventions are their own little subculture.
6067488	6071371	I'm sure Ranma would have a lot to say on this topic, with as many as he goes to.
6071371	6073513	Even in Parsippany, New Jersey.
6077472	6083075	has its own little community around it, the regulars, the new folks, and how people fit into it.
6083075	6087857	I mean, TwitchCon certainly feels a lot different than going to Anime Expo back in the day.
6087857	6091578	Fanime felt different than Anime Expo.
6091578	6096901	But it's like its own little microcosm of a community.
6096901	6097701	Yeah.
6097701	6104084	And with its own social rules and its own language sometimes, and it's really beautiful to watch, but
6104887	6108449	But yeah, Ranma, I would love to make that a VOG roundtable.
6108449	6111211	I love the idea of that series coming back.
6111211	6115133	But it's just it's just the thought of.
6115133	6124978	You know, no matter like where on the spectrum people are, they've come together for this one thing just to have joy.
6124978	6132843	Just to be full of joy and bring each other joy and to enjoy each other's company, enjoying the thing that brings them joy.
6132843	6134524	And we don't have enough of that, you know?
6135600	6150392	I mean, the internet used to make me really happy until, you know, the echo chamber got so loud and so, you know, lots of, you know, data breaches and you name it and AI and bullshit.
6153093	6155374	I just want to follow up to- I miss those communities.
6155374	6158215	I just want to follow up to DJ Ranma's comment saying possible VOG roundtable.
6158215	6165178	Honestly, I wonder if they're still looking for DragonCon roundtables because they've been doing stuff every week leading up to DragonCon.
6165178	6168699	That might be a fun way to get you kids involved with that a little bit to some extent.
6168699	6169820	So- If they find me out.
6170040	6174045	No, no, no, no, it's virtual virtual roundtables leading up to the actual event.
6174045	6175286	It's just to find me out.
6175286	6176387	I'm famous.
6176387	6178450	Good luck.
6178450	6179631	Okay.
6179631	6183916	Well, look, I can't wait for you to make that case.
6183916	6189262	But anyway, I could just fake being an heiress in New York, you know.
6190542	6191423	GoldenState Pinball Expo
6213700	6217947	Alright, let's travel to some release dates around the world.
6217947	6220010	So Loki, we'll start with you.
6220010	6222935	And I don't know if Jamie wants to do UK dates or what?
6222935	6223496	I'll do mine.
6223496	6224157	Alright, cool.
6224157	6225960	So we'll start with Loki in the US.
6226837	6233759	World of Warcraft Cataclysm update on PC and Mac Neptunia Sisters vs. Sisters on Xbox One and Xbox Series
6249071	6255377	Senua's Saga Hellblade 2 on PC and Xbox Series.
6255377	6257379	That game finally is coming out.
6257379	6259621	Finally coming out this week.
6259621	6265386	Okay, with all the hype upon hype upon hype that Microsoft put into that game.
6265386	6266867	I had no idea it was coming out this week.
6266867	6267208	Finally.
6267208	6270451	Yeah, they have done no advertising.
6270451	6270611	So
6272941	6273722	I don't know why.
6273722	6274522	I'm literally speaking.
6274522	6275403	OK, anyway.
6275403	6276204	OK, move on.
6276204	6278506	It's fine.
6278506	6285992	System Shock is getting its console release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

6450402	6453503	So let's go to UK.
6453503	6464169	Well, before we do that, I do also want to mention that for anyone who was following it, um, the group that was doing, uh, drag her, the drag queen fighting game.
6464169	6466990	Um, they don't have the funding.
6466990	6469512	They don't have the ability to finish the game.
6469512	6476795	So they are, they've released it for free on steam with everything that they have, uh, for the game in the game.
6476795	6477676	So it's free.
6478885	6480507	Give it a go.
6480507	6481248	Give it a try.
6481248	6482450	Send them some love and support.
6482450	6483752	They put a lot of heart into this game.
6483752	6487397	Alright, so coming out though in the UK.
6489054	6493577	On the 21st, for PlayStation and Xbox, we have System Shock.
6493577	6498480	And for PlayStation and Switch, we have, uh, Iodine Chronicles, Hundred Heroes.
6498480	6505063	On the 23rd, we have, uh, for Switch, we have Paper Mario, The Thousand Year Door.
6505063	6512848	And then for, on the 24th for PlayStation and Xbox, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which I was playing like, what, six years ago?
6512848	6515209	I mean, anyway.
6515209	6518051	And then also on PlayStation, we have Madison VR.
6521371	6522452	All right.
6522452	6523473	Well, we will move on.
6523473	6525115	We have just a couple more stories for you.
6525115	6528278	And then we'll get to our listener roundtable emails and all that good stuff.
6528278	6530520	Maybe a call or two maybe, maybe.
6530520	6530981	We'll see.
6530981	6534604	Let's get to these first last stories.
6534604	6534845	Loki.
6536378	6541242	The petition in the UK has reached 10,000 signatures, which requires a government response.
6553442	6564450	And well, they received a response from the government saying, you know, essentially the case was that those games selling must comply with UK consumer law.
6564450	6571614	They must provide clear information and continue or allow continued access to the games that are sold on the understanding it will remain playable indefinitely.
6571614	6572215	That's of course,
6572635	6574956	what they were asserting with the campaign.
6574956	6587601	The government response is consumers should be aware that there is no requirement in UK law compelling software companies to provide and providers to support older versions of their operating system software or connected products.
6587601	6597085	There may be occasions where companies make a commercial decision based on high running costs of maintaining older servers for video games that have declining user bases.
6597085	6600607	So essentially, not necessarily the response that they were waiting to see,
6601027	6602748	But I think that's kind of that makes sense.
6602748	6603049	Yes.
6603049	6605911	Existing laws don't really cover that.
6605911	6609173	But what they're trying to do is get laws passed to cover that.
6609173	6621582	And so now the next step is if the petition can hit 100,000 signatures, then that'll be enough for it to be subject to a parliamentary debate.
6621582	6625525	So it'll be brought to the floor to be debated, I guess.
6625525	6627847	They would actually have to debate it on the floor.
6627847	6628848	That's great.
6628848	6629088	Yes.
6630462	6637505	So yes, but as of right now, not surprised that there are no laws that protect consumers in that way.
6637505	6638886	All right.
6638886	6641547	Well, maybe there should be.
6641547	6643268	That's what they're trying to do.
6643268	6652232	The whole situation is just, you know, it's just this peril of living in this online and connected world and all this other stuff.
6652232	6655214	But anyway, we've talked about this to death.
6655214	6655374	So
6656007	6659831	I mean, yeah, I mean, we talked to all these different companies looking to make live service games.
6659831	6661892	What do you think is going to happen to all those games?
6661892	6671061	They're going to get shut down like it's going to be horrible for video game conservation and stuff.
6671061	6676186	SSJ100 Matt says it tickles me that they still wear wigs in the UK Supreme Court.
6676186	6677006	Yes.
6677006	6681711	I want to see a bunch of men in wigs argue about this.
6681711	6681891	Right.
6683530	6687411	Guess what, a lot of our congressmen are also wearing wigs, they just call them toupees.
6687411	6697695	Alright, moving on though, we have talked about the battle pass and all that issue to death, so let's talk about death and other means.
6697695	6704238	I want to talk about dead by daylight, which I saved this for last on purpose, thinking that DarkSakura might make it in time.
6705078	6713985	And you already mentioned last week on the show, you talked about that Dungeons and Dragons was being teased for a collaboration with Dead by Daylight.
6713985	6722672	And we did find out this week that yes, Dungeons and Dragons is coming to Dead by Daylight and we'll be getting the new killer Vecna will be coming to the game.
6724822	6726765	Memories Around Vecna
6742921	6746185	It's little and bitch combined into one word, the lich.
6746185	6753132	Um, I will say from watching the Oh, and there is a new survivor as well, who is a literal elf.
6753132	6753773	Two survivors.
6753773	6755054	Well, no, it's one.
6755054	6756156	One is a human.
6756156	6758358	No, one's a human bard and the other is an elven bard.
6758358	6760420	But it's it's a legendary reskin, right?
6760420	6761481	So it's one survivor slot.
6762318	6763039	right?
6763039	6764381	Because there's no separate perks.
6764381	6767945	Yeah, it's one survivor slot with legendary reskin.
6767945	6771910	The female elf is the default and the male is a switch.
6771910	6773652	And she's adorable.
6773652	6777297	And whose name I cannot recall and is not here in front of me.
6778198	6781079	Oh, the name of that survivor.
6781079	6797105	But when I was watching the public test round, what was cracking me up is that Vecna has this whole mechanism with like you have chests that are all throughout the field and you actually roll a d20 and a little d20 comes up on the screen.
6797105	6806509	And if you get a 20, you might get like a really fucking awesome item, which the one I saw was the whole like if you run into a locker, it will literally teleport you to another locker on the map.
6806969	6809311	It is the get out of a killer chase free card.
6809311	6811473	That's really overpowered in my opinion.
6811473	6814396	But you know, that's great for tunnelers.
6814396	6817018	Also, it's a street as our that's it.
6817018	6817659	Okay, thank you.
6817659	6821603	And the male is a bear Mara's.
6821603	6831552	So, but if you roll a one, then the chest becomes a mimic and it will actually start eating you and make you scream, which is only going to make the list find you easier.
6832040	6832060	I
6853428	6853828	Skullmommy
6877774	6883821	And that's why when I saw in the trailer, she's sneaking in and opening the box with the hand.
6883821	6890748	I'm like, oh, shit, I did this this in in a real D&D game before.
6890748	6895654	And then, you know, you turn around and he's like, uh, sup, bitch?
6895654	6896014	Yeah.
6896014	6897115	Oh, Vecna is not.
6898655	6900896	a bad guy to be trifle with.
6910675	6916297	a whole little talent where they play a guitar.
6916297	6922400	And they actually like, yeah, I think it's a, it's a, another D20 mechanic if I remember right.
6922400	6923800	And we're playing for you on Twitch.
6923800	6927081	This is just a random YouTube of somebody actually playing as Vekna.
6927081	6929963	You can see what it looks like in game and like the different abilities and stuff.
6931363	6952437	so uh but the um and you can actually see how rad this map is too it's it's and you see the beholder that was the one from the trailer and this there's one of the portals yep and this really is probably the best map i've seen behavior make for the game and this is coming off the it's the borgo yeah the um the alien map the nostromo was really good too so they're on a roll lately with this stuff
6953238	6961107	They took the Knights map and completely retooled it for this character.
6961107	6961908	It's pretty awesome.
6961908	6966914	I mean, I do like the bright yellow and red map, I'll be honest.
6966914	6968236	But this is cool.
6968236	6969157	Not the YouTube buffering.
6969777	6972619	All right, let's see if I can skip ahead to a different part.
6972619	6978804	I have a blender rip of the new character and her instrument.
6978804	6980505	But yeah, it just looks really cool.
6980505	6985388	So I'm excited to check that out when it actually hits the live game.
6985388	6994935	But because they were doing the 8th anniversary announcements, they decided they weren't going to stop there and they would announce a little further in advance too, which to be fair, they did last year.
6994935	6995956	If I remember, I didn't
6996576	7004580	Resident Evil didn't come out for the anniversary that came out later right and they teased that or that was Resident Evil part two specifically with Ada Wong and all that.
7004580	7010843	This time around, they have announced the next collaboration will be Castlevania, which
7012116	7041253	has been rumored there's some leaks out there some pretty some DVD leakers that are getting a lot of clout right now because they called this one but Castlevania is going to be the next collaboration not the first time behavior has worked with Konami because of course Silent Hill is in the game and Cheryl probably has more reskins than anybody else because you can be Cheryl you can be Nurse Lisa you can be James which doesn't make any sense but anyway you can be Alyssa you can be the cop what's her name
7041838	7041940	Uh...
7042847	7046430	So you can be Cheryl's like 20 different characters.
7046430	7047270	Cybill Bennett.
7047270	7048572	Cybill, that's it.
7048572	7051334	And then you can be Pyramid Head.
7051334	7053635	And you can be Robby if you play Legion.
7053635	7054256	That's right.
7054256	7056378	And Robby, not the robot.
7056378	7057579	I was going to say Robby the robot.
7057579	7058860	Robby the rabbit.
7058860	7059900	Yes, is a legionary skin.
7059900	7061001	So there's lots of Silent Hills.
7061001	7062302	And then it got its own map, too.
7062302	7063984	And the Midwich map is pretty rad.
7063984	7071650	And it's a very it's a very like definitive map because it's very it's like probably the easiest map to understand.
7072310	7081092	So true story, on that map, if you've got survivors who don't know what the crap they're doing, you get a really quick 4K on it.
7081092	7083572	I got my Clown Adept on it in five minutes.
7083572	7084653	Oh, wow.
7084653	7085273	Literally.
7085273	7087393	Midwich is a square donut map.
7087393	7087993	That is all it is.
7087993	7088253	It is.
7088253	7092414	It's a square donut map with staircases on both sides.
7092414	7093475	And an Easter egg.
7093475	7094775	Yeah.
7094775	7094975	So.
7096561	7102847	There's an easter egg too, the whole summoning circle thing, if you do the gens in a certain order, right?
7102847	7113415	Oh yeah, so you have to do, and you don't always get both of these generators, so you have to do, you can do the bottom ones, that's fine, but upstairs you have to do the chem lab first.
7114352	7116373	And then you have to do the music room.
7116373	7119815	When you do the chem lab, you'll hear the bell tower go off.
7119815	7123777	And then you do the same for the music room.
7123777	7130281	And if you do both of that, and you hear both of the chimes, then at the end game collapse, so when the gates are open,
7132282	7141967	The clock tower opens and usually there's an item of rare quality, although I've gotten flashlights every last time I've gotten it done.
7141967	7146430	Actually, the last few times I've gotten it done, my game's been glitched and I don't see the doors open.
7146430	7150232	I just see my friends walking through the door, going into the clock tower and getting whatever they want.
7151294	7152034	But it's really cool.
7152034	7153435	It's a neat effect.
7153435	7157177	Um, so it has the sign of Metatron in it, too.
7157177	7161478	So obviously, behaviors done a great job with Konami previously.
7161478	7163699	So Castlevania in that regard does make sense.
7163699	7166460	But of course, I'm sure a lot of people are going to house Castlevania to work in Dead by Daylight.
7166460	7169842	But I think it's about fucking time we had a vampire character in the game.
7169842	7172823	I think it's obvious Dracula's got to be the killer.
7172823	7174244	And it'll be specifically the the
7175003	7178125	I just can't see a Belmont being a survivor like that.
7178125	7179346	What if we get Maria?
7185911	7187412	or is it just a licensed killer?
7187412	7192616	According to some of the people I follow, the rumor is that it's going to be with the December release.
7192616	7193557	Okay.
7193557	7199241	Because they're guessing that that's the next big licensed one with both killer and survivor.
7199241	7201603	And that's where the thought is going for right now.
7201603	7209368	But also the other reason why we have Vecna for D&D is they were going to get a vampire.
7209368	7210529	Yeah, I heard about that.
7210529	7213852	Yeah, they were doing Count something was supposed to be the D&D character.
7213852	7214072	Yeah.
7214440	7216462	Yeah, my brain no work.
7216462	7221365	But but yeah, that they because Castlevania, they got the deal for it.
7221365	7222767	They went with Vecna instead.
7222767	7223527	Yeah.
7223527	7228911	Which means that all of those people who were saying that Stranger Things Vecna was coming in were kind of like minuscule.
7228911	7230092	Correct.
7230092	7231994	I believe there is an interview.
7231994	7241561	It was a hoax, but yeah, I believe there's an interview out there with somebody from Behavior that said this doesn't rule out Stranger Things Vecna, but they just have nothing else to announce at this time.
7241561	7242002	But they are.
7242002	7243463	Would they do like a reskin?
7244787	7253591	I don't see how they could with the deal between Hasbro and the deal with Netflix.
7253591	7255532	They would have to call the killer something else.
7255532	7263796	They would have to have the lich and they would have to have the whatever would make sense, the imagination or I don't know what they would call it.
7263796	7267178	I think it was like experiment, whatever.
7267178	7269739	Yeah, the experiment or something that might be.
7269739	7271680	So they would have to like have it.
7271680	7273581	I mean, Chucky is the good guy.
7273581	7273781	Yeah.
7274381	7278004	So, but anyway, I think Dead by Daylight's in a pretty good place right now.
7278004	7283028	Actually, since you're here, DarkSakura, before we get to the listener roundtable, I kind of want to ask you, what do you think of the Chaos Shuffle event going on right now?
7283028	7283589	Because I think it's great.
7283589	7284870	I haven't had a chance to play anything.
7284870	7285611	It's not long enough.
7285611	7287032	Oh, that's right, because it's only been this weekend.
7287032	7288493	It's not long enough.
7288493	7289294	I think it's great.
7289294	7290495	Do you know why I think it's great?
7290495	7292356	Six days.
7292356	7293677	Here's the thing.
7293677	7296400	Because killers and survivors cannot bring sweaty builds.
7296980	7298742	VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7306175	7306916	VOG Network, DJ Ranma
7331212	7333232	I'm gonna log in tonight, but I'm not streaming.
7333232	7335613	I'm just logging in to get my blood points.
7335613	7343475	But I'm gonna spend a little bit of... I mean, if it's still going on Tuesday, then I'll be dedicating my survivor time to that.
7343475	7353877	So... But it's... It's... I think that they're really trying to keep people playing the game who have gotten burnt out.
7353877	7354417	Yeah.
7354417	7354997	That makes sense.
7354997	7356197	Makes sense.
7356197	7360038	And just when I think I might take a step back from it, I get pulled right back in.
7360836	7362858	Yeah, and now this D&D thing is huge.
7362858	7364780	It's going to be a real... The D&D thing is really big for me.
7364780	7368424	It's going to be as good as the Resident Evil stuff was for the game, I think.
7368424	7369265	Oh, yeah.
7369265	7376132	And... But I was still a little bit on the fence until I saw the trailer and saw her going for the hand.
7376132	7376933	Yeah.
7376933	7382559	And that was exactly the same feeling I had playing that campaign for the first time.
7382559	7383360	So... Good times.
7384386	7384867	Yeah.
7384867	7385748	All right.
7385748	7387991	Well, let's get to the listener roundtable.

7416955	7418015	I know we have at least one.
7418015	7420636	I think there might be two, but at least one.
7420636	7421537	I'm checking.
7421537	7423678	And we're going to get to those here in just a moment.
7423678	7428199	I will jump quickly to Loki for a last minute story if we happen to have one before we do eels.
7428199	7429240	I don't have any.
7429580	7431201	All right, unfortunately, well, guess what?
7431201	7433502	We have a call in the green room so we can get to that first.
7433502	7434082	So let's do it.
7434082	7435203	Let's get right into it.
7435203	7435683	Hello.
7435683	7436803	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
7436803	7438424	Who's this?
7438424	7440525	Oh, hi, everybody.
7440525	7441826	It's the one and only Ranma.
7441826	7442826	How's everybody doing tonight?
7442826	7443926	I am doing fabulous.
7443926	7447588	And I love the shirt you're wearing because I happen to have the same one.
7447588	7448449	I know.
7448449	7449349	I just had to.
7449349	7450409	I just had to.
7450409	7450870	Thank you.
7450870	7452090	It's great.
7452090	7454651	Not not currently, but sometimes.
7454651	7455612	What's on your mind, buddy?
7455612	7455972	How you doing?
7457196	7464198	Look, you just have to mention con culture, and- Oh, I thought this might be it.
7464198	7474180	20 plus years of drunken and sober camaraderie, over 250 conventions- How many cons do you go to in a year?
7474180	7475620	At least 15.
7475620	7476340	At least 15.
7476340	7477340	No.
7477340	7478121	No.
7478121	7478721	No.
7478721	7484422	I would say at least four or five, because more than half of them are local.
7486176	7509235	uh okay okay yeah if you go back to like late 90s early 2000s 2010s cons were scattered all over con chairs would actually work with each other on dates so that they wouldn't overlap each other now it's like oh i'm having my con this weekend well screw you i'm having my con this weekend and the other person's like well we're like
7509995	7512499	5-6 hours away from y'all so we're doing it this weekend.
7512499	7513680	So many.
7513680	7519248	Yes, because of the pandemic, the convention bubble legitimately burst.
7519248	7521350	Yeah.
7521350	7524935	And then the great idea was, let's do virtual conventions.
7524935	7526117	Oh, I was all about that.
7526949	7542521	but that one 4th of July weekend where I had Twitch up on the Xbox for a convention, Twitch up on one laptop for another convention, and then Twitch up on this desk for another convention, trying to pay attention to all of it, and I went and said,
7544019	7550266	This is bullshit and I just cut it all off and just decided to play video games only tuned in for certain panels and that was it.
7561778	7564380	me personally, I hated the I hated it.
7564380	7569623	I I'm fine with it with things that are related to my day job and the professional stuff, because I don't know.
7569623	7571945	It's a very different vibe.
7571945	7575227	And so like I can do virtual conventions, my day job, and I've done stuff like that.
7575227	7585634	But that's very different from like the personal hanging out that, you know, there's a certain culture of randomness that I don't need for my work conventions that I do need for my personal personal conventions.
7585634	7587255	And that's for me.
7587255	7588776	I wasn't getting that from the virtual thing.
7588776	7590457	I understand why it happened.
7590457	7591538	It's an era of our lives.
7592499	7592659	Nugget
7613359	7625185	But now I don't really mind it per se because there are still some conventions that still do the whole virtual effect, but it's more like, oh, we'll stream certain panels and events.
7625185	7630047	You pay 10 bucks and you have access to it for this year and prior years.
7630047	7630947	I'm okay with that.
7630947	7631948	You have that option.
7632428	7633049	DragonCon DC TV
7653288	7655769	This let them be a part of the fandoms they love.
7672139	7673739	is the cosplay aspect.
7673739	7684122	Now, I record a lot of cosplay masquerades, so basically you're on stage with your props, you have a little minute, about a time to do what you gotta do.
7684122	7689664	In the virtual sense, they're basically told, well, here's your time.
7691138	7692219	Have at it.
7692219	7707087	You have cosplayers doing their skits in backyards, parks, in front of museums, all over just to get it like as close to the anime that they're doing as possible and throwing in all these special effects.
7707087	7710008	That is one of the best things I've seen come out of it.
7710008	7713971	Fully animated backgrounds on a green screen that they've done from scratch.
7713971	7714211	Yes.
7715339	7728988	I mean, granted, there are some conventions now where you can still do your skit on the stage, you have the video playing in the background, some cons, the background's a giant backdrop, others not so much, but you can make it work, you know?
7728988	7735092	I think we might've got a little off track to what you were originally called, which is fine, but OLR, Tangents, what?
7735092	7739415	What did you really want to talk about tonight, DarkSakura?
7739415	7743918	No, the culture, the convention culture is like, you will go to a con,
7744716	7761349	Not knowing anybody after three days, you're gonna walk out with probably a couple of hundred of photos, half of them are selfies, new social media contacts, and then you're chatting with them the next week over random and awesome stuff.
7761349	7768935	I like the fact that one of my favorite things about the con culture is late Friday nights and late Saturday nights.
7768935	7772018	What we used to do was hang out in front of
7772418	7800387	the hotel not the lobby but in the hotel you find con goers there's all different types of conversations next thing you know someone's like you here have a drink it's this and this and you're just having a good time yes i understand you know you shouldn't take a drink from somebody that you don't know but in that con culture they're not gonna start doing with the uh with the religious protesters though at anime expo i miss that in full costume
7801392	7803934	Oh, Jamie, you'd like this.
7803934	7811240	If it can be found, every year at ZankiCon, there's always that one person that has the religious guy.
7811240	7818006	There is a picture of me cosplaying Gardebel, standing right next to him, giving the seal of approval or something like that.
7818006	7819087	There's a picture.
7819087	7821569	And he thinks I'm actually on his side.
7821569	7821709	No.
7824537	7825318	That's great.
7825318	7839988	Yeah, I you know, it's when DarkSakura was talking about that, you know, what she was talking about the being a little more extroverted, I guess this year in the connections she was making, you know, it might surprise you all, but the first couple Dragon Cons I went to, I was also very insulated because I didn't hardly know anybody.
7839988	7847213	I have very vivid memories of going to my first LGBT kind of party at Dragon Con, really hoping to meet people.
7847213	7848033	And I had I had one.
7850495	7858058	Bless this drag queen who came up and talked to me because she saw that I was kind of like lonely and she actually came up and talked to me, asked who I was and what I was about.
7858058	7863100	And you know, she doesn't know like, yeah, I have this like long running podcast about video games, all this stuff.
7863100	7865221	And she was a and I wish I remembered her name.
7865221	7865701	God damn it.
7866041	7869244	But she was a Star Trek themed drag queen, classic Star Trek.
7869244	7871646	She only did dress ups from classic Star Trek.
7871646	7872466	And I won't forget that.
7872466	7874108	I mean, I forgot her name, which I guess isn't great.
7874108	7876870	But I won't forget that gesture, which I thought was like really awesome.
7876870	7880873	Because yeah, it took it took me a little while to find my footing socially, as well.
7880873	7881554	So you know,
7883974	7885936	But now and now I've got my own crowd.
7885936	7891000	And I know even even Bobby's like, wow, Rob's just like got his own group, the Dragon Con.
7891000	7896764	And, you know, sometimes we intermix, you know, and I've borrowed I've borrowed one of his friends over the years, too.
7896764	7901768	So like, you know, it's just like her and her and I were hanging out a lot with because it was Alan's first year.
7901768	7904070	So Bobby has another friend.
7904070	7907553	And last year, especially, we just like we pretty much kidnapped her for the entire weekend.
7907553	7908694	Is it Heather Wood?
7908694	7909735	What?
7909735	7910756	Is it Heather Wood?
7910756	7912177	Was she out of New York?
7912177	7912357	No.
7913658	7915539	Okay, Rob, to go back to the LGBT meetup, I have a little story.
7915539	7917079	I have a con kid that
7938707	7942248	My real kid but someone I adopted along the way, you know.
7942248	7955392	So she comes with us to conventions and so forth and she's shy and quiet but she loves anime and cosplay and through deducting and reasoning I discovered she's queer.
7955392	7956232	So I'm like, you know what?
7957108	7959170	I wouldn't introduce you to all of my queer friends.
7959170	7968300	So if there's a question that you're going to ask me that I don't have an answer to, here's a list of your gay aunts and uncles that's going to answer them for you.
7968300	7969621	Behold, gays.
7971824	7973225	Exactly!
7973225	7979227	And I introduce her to all, and she just gets excited going to concerts.
7979227	7985529	She knows this person, she has somebody that also she can hang out with and so forth.
7985529	7992352	If I'm not around, if Mako, if Alice is not around, there's places that she can go and hang out with and so forth.
7992352	7995473	That's another thing that I really enjoy about this culture.
7995473	7999675	It's like, for the most part, nobody gives a damn about
8000686	8008089	In my case, you wake up still in your live-action vampire outfit under somebody's bed.
8008089	8010190	That was my first Mobicon.
8030459	8034744	I will tell another Dragon Con story that to kind of wrap this up, but it's it's a good one.
8034744	8043955	It's how I how I met one of my closest probably Dragon Con pals, Jordan, that I see every year and hang out with for at least a little bit and him and his group and you know, I met a lot of them.
8043955	8046818	So the funny story about Jordan is that I met Jordan, we were hanging out.
8046818	8050042	So Exetior came to Dragon Con one year, it was the year before the
8050682	8051783	Panini.
8051783	8058428	He came to DragonCon before he had a kid too, which is also a reason why he hasn't been back since then, as he's being a full-time dad.
8058428	8065674	But Extro was there, and Extro knew, I think he met a group of people through Twitter, because at the time Twitter was cool.
8065674	8077964	He met a group of people through that, and I went with him to go to these DragonCon events, and then we kind of met like a little group of like his Twitter friends and their friends, and then I, you know, we were just talking and like all hanging out, and then like
8078504	8083327	Jordan was on Facebook doing so he's like, Oh, sorry, I'm doing this like online survivor thing.
8083327	8083927	I've got to check.
8083927	8085668	I'm like, Hold up, hold up.
8085668	8088209	You do online like fake survivor games.
8088209	8091091	He's like, Yeah, I'm like, I play orgs too.
8091091	8095293	And we realized, we knew each other's games that we were and like, it was one of those things.
8095293	8100316	It was like, wait a minute, because obviously, that's a very, like nuanced, like small circle, right?
8100316	8103278	And then once it only takes that connection, right?
8103278	8105319	Once we had that connection, we were like,
8106019	8109521	Now it's like, okay, DragonCon bestie, like, let's go, let's hang out.
8109521	8113303	Because like, you and I have an understanding, we have a connection.
8113303	8120027	And this is like a thing we can talk about, like literally all night, there is so much drama in those games, which I haven't played in a long time.
8120027	8123409	And I probably won't again, just because they're a big time sink.
8123409	8128192	But there's like so much drama and things you can talk about with all that.
8128192	8128712	So it's just it's
8128872	8129353	And that was cool.
8129353	8134863	It was like DragonCon kind of brought that together, even though we were in this other nerd circle.
8134863	8142295	It was like, oh, when we're at the capital of nerddom once a year, like you're these nerd circles are going to come together.
8142295	8142435	So.
8145146	8149867	I'll say this real quick, then I'll go about my merry little way and let other people call in.
8149867	8163553	In regards to DragonCon, and also in regards to the wedding that I went to a couple of weekends ago that was Downton Abbey themed, my friend Shannon now met his current wife, DragonCon.
8163553	8170136	They were longtime friends and they finally met and it just frickin' clicked for them.
8170136	8170896	Couldn't be any happier.
8171445	8173849	Podculture in chat says Ranma should come to DragonCon.
8173849	8177055	You're not the first to say that.
8177055	8177536	Again!
8178419	8181440	Large crowds do me no good.
8181440	8185742	It's a miracle that I make it through Anime NYC.
8185742	8189604	It's crowded, but it's so spread out with stuff.
8189604	8191965	I don't mind it as much.
8191965	8194407	That's kind of what was good about TwitchCon.
8194407	8195407	It's spread out.
8195407	8196067	Yeah.
8196067	8201050	And I would I would say, you know, Alan is also very he was very nervous about that.
8201050	8203571	And he still is like, this place is really fucking crowded.
8203571	8205452	But you find your little cubbies.
8206112	8207593	You and I don't mean people.
8207593	8210455	I mean, like you find your little like, like, like ballroom.
8210455	8212196	That's not what they're calling new bears now.
8212196	8213777	Yeah, little cubbies.
8213777	8217599	That's where you find your track room.
8217599	8220121	You find your people playing werewolf ballroom.
8220121	8222042	You find your gaming place.
8222042	8230167	You find that fucking three story America Mart that randomly had the DMD campaigns last year that was extremely fucking spread out and empty, but it worked.
8230487	8244076	You can kind of find, because like, yeah, when you see the videos online of the Super Bowl of Cosplay, yes, you're going to see the wall-to-wall people, Marriott, because that's the fucking capital of cosplay and people want to be seen there.
8244076	8247198	But there's a lot of DragonCon you're not seeing in those videos.
8247198	8255143	That's a little more, you know, but I, again, I'm not trying to diminish your concerns because, yeah, it's a valid concern, especially the elevator games are going to be no fun.
8255703	8262709	But I think, you know, those of us that don't like the big crowds that survive DragonCon sort of figure out how to balance it.
8262709	8264751	You sort of find your getaway spots, so.
8266226	8270749	think about it, but again, I would be going in the mindset as press and coverage.
8270749	8277573	I think for DragonCon, I would have to be more of an attendee to kick back, relax, and enjoy it more.
8277573	8286619	Like I've done that for a couple of conventions, and yet I still brought old Bertha with me to take pictures because I'm like, people got to check out what I saw, you know?
8286619	8289420	Or go as an attendee or a panelist one year.
8289420	8291782	I bet we could get you on a panel, but
8292935	8294296	Anyway, okay with that.
8294296	8295777	That's another topic for another time.
8295777	8309204	So anyway, I will get your final comment here and then we'll let you go and get to the emails.
8309204	8312185	Finding an apartment in New York City blows.
8312185	8312926	That's it.
8312926	8322291	Even I know that and I'm on the fucking other coast of the country outside of San Francisco and I would say the actual process of finding an apartment in New York is worse.
8323516	8330341	Look, I've had people say, you should go to Jersey, and I turn and look, nobody goes to Jersey willingly.
8330341	8331862	That person is not your friend anymore.
8331862	8338026	And there are people in Jersey that say, yeah, we're not there willingly.
8338026	8338987	All right.
8338987	8340308	All right, my friend, we'll let you go.
8340308	8340628	Take care.
8340628	8341629	It's always good to hear from you, Rama.
8341629	8342690	All right, bye, guys.
8342690	8344191	Y'all take care.
8344191	8346652	Happy Memorial Day, all that good stuff.
8346652	8347733	My birthday's coming up.
8347733	8350215	I'm going to get lit, so I'll see you last year.
8350215	8352637	Let me be the first to say, happy fucking birthday.
8353442	8354424	E-Mail Singular
8367850	8369271	Yes, I'll read it.
8369271	8369812	I'm here.
8369812	8370292	Why not?
8370292	8371733	Yes, let's do it.
8371733	8373014	Hello, OLR.
8373014	8377858	On the show last week, Rob mentioned that I was at Furry Weekend Atlanta, or FWA.
8377858	8380039	This is Garth Wolfe.
8380039	8385403	I wanted to chime in on some gaming-related activities that happened at the con, namely the game room.
8385403	8395311	The space they had for the arcade was even larger than last year, having arcade cabinets provided by SafePoint for plenty of rhythm fighting and even train simulation game action.
8397653	8400437	Savepoint does DragonCon too, so yeah, they're great.
8401596	8410061	One thing of note is that all of the arcade cabinets, the one that had the largest group of people surrounding it at all times, was none other than Dance Rush Stardom.
8410061	8419887	That wasn't the case last year, so it seems that interest in the game has grown, despite no new versions of the game being announced, if I am recalling correctly.
8419887	8426511	You can bet your ass I was bouncing my tail on that platform, but someone recorded me playing Pump It Up in DDR Max 2 in fursuit.
8426511	8427531	Freakin' Max 2!
8427531	8429593	I was so excited to play that mix once again.
8430573	8438395	In addition to the arcade area, they had a dedicated space for speedrunning a game called Fastest Furs.
8438395	8454619	From Sonic Adventure DX to Super Mario RPG, they ran through games over the course of two days to raise $12,275 for their charity, Lost and Found Youth, who have the goal of finding safety and shelter for Atlanta's LGBT homeless youth.
8455379	8463289	This is just a small part of what happens at FWA in addition to the crazy dances, guest performances, mystery skulls, mystery skulls!
8463289	8463830	Holy shit.
8465171	8466892	I love Mystery Skulls.
8466892	8471916	Fursuiting and cosplay, beer and mead tastings, room parties, and general confuckery.
8471916	8474217	I will be back in 2025 for sure.
8474217	8474637	Love y'all.
8474637	8475118	Garth Wolfe.
8495671	8497973	I go to Atlanta enough as it I know everybody always jokes.
8497973	8498994	She's just moved to Atlanta.
8498994	8499574	Let's make it clear.
8499574	8500635	I'm not moving to Atlanta.
8500635	8505378	I can't do that because of the if you knew what I did for a living, you'd be like, Oh, you have to be in California.
8505378	8507740	And this is not going to happen.
8507740	8509121	And same thing with my husband.
8509121	8517166	So but I love to visit but it's like I would love to go to FWA if it wasn't like another reason to go to Atlanta when I have two other cons.
8518147	8523028	Like DragonCon, and hopefully again, not this year, but maybe another year, Southern Pride Gaming Expo.
8523028	8528829	But I would love to go to, I'd love to, I'm not, I don't consider myself part of the furry community, but I know they're chill as fuck.
8528829	8532810	And like, I am all about just a chill as fuck weekend with chill as fuck people.
8532810	8535210	And that's what it sounds like FWA is really turning into.
8535210	8536110	And that sounds great.
8536110	8537431	And Bobby mentioned he went there.
8537431	8542251	I know Bobby's not in that community, but Bobby's like, but there's speedrunning people that intersect there.
8542251	8543772	So he went down to meet the speedrunning people.
8543772	8545072	And it sounds like he had a great time.
8546152	8562786	And he translated to DragonCon speak your email for me by saying that the game room was the Hilton Galleria rooms, but with the partitions down, the way it used to be before all the tracks were down there, including... So that same game room, Garth, or anybody that was at FWA,
8563747	8588103	is where the podcasting room at DragonCon is but it's partitioned so they actually make like eight rooms down there where the anime track is and the Star Trek track is but that used to be back in the day where tabletop gaming was and the big pods that used to be the mech thing that was at Dave and Buster's all those years ago that have been turned into something else that was all down there too
8588883	8590324	Now that's all at Americamart.
8590324	8594846	But that's something that the basement of the Hilton was famously known for.
8594846	8595546	So thank you.
8595546	8598528	Bobby translated it to Hilton's or to DragonCon speak to it.
8598528	8600329	So I know exactly what room you're talking about.
8600329	8602850	And that is a great it's with the partitions are down.
8602850	8603851	It's huge.
8603851	8606092	I love that space when it was tabletop.
8606092	8611655	In fact, most people would argue it was better when tabletop was there.
8613017	8616119	I do like America Mart for being spacious.
8616119	8621442	Again, going back to to Ranma's concerns, America Mart is spacious.
8621442	8627106	So you don't really like you're not up people's asses like maybe you were in the Hilton Galleria like really close together.
8627106	8632008	But yeah, it was it's I think a lot of people like tabletop better when it was down there.
8632008	8634510	So anyway, all right.
8634510	8635971	Love the email party on Garth.
8635971	8637192	Thank you for the email.
8637192	8637612	Appreciate it.
8638697	8647383	Alright, if you want to send us an email for a future week participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura, we got to get you to DragonCon or for it.
8647383	8648743	Let's go to free weekend Atlanta.
8648743	8650505	It'd be fun.
8650505	8659530	Just somebody wanna let's just I'm not I'm not gonna dress up but I mean, I literally have neither many or time.
8659530	8662332	Yeah, I have to pick my Yeah, I get it.
8662332	8663513	I get it.
8663513	8664774	All right.
8664774	8667976	Um, did you I guess do we have any last minute stories, Loki?
8668666	8669667	Or no, we ran out, didn't we?
8669667	8670047	Nope.
8670047	8670247	Nope.
8670247	8670527	Nope.
8670527	8671568	We're done.
8671568	8671988	All right.
8671988	8672868	Well, then that's it.
8672868	8675350	We've had a we've had a pretty good show tonight.
8675350	8678972	It's time to wrap up and say we will see you in two weeks.
8678972	8685176	Again, I'm not going to be here Memorial Day weekend, so we will not have a show, but I believe DarkSakura will still be streaming.
8685176	8687197	Loki's doing some other stuff as well, right?
8687197	8688878	With your Minecraft buddies, right?
8688878	8690359	Yeah, on Saturday.
8690979	8694440	So, uh, I'm going to be streaming a little bit earlier than before.
8694440	8694980	There you go.
8694980	8695440	There you go.
8695440	8699582	So if you, if you need some, and Bobby will be here at the Voice Geeks Network, holding down the fort alone.
8699582	8709665	So if you need the, and maybe what's going on Sunday, maybe if it works out, I might still be able to call into Bobby's show if he wants, but no promises on that.
8709665	8712185	Um, so that's, that's it.
8712185	8714286	We'll see you in two weeks until then.
8714286	8718347	Uh, as I always say at the end of show, thank you so much for listening to Orange Tons Radio and supporting the show.
8718347	8720428	If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.
8720808	8726152	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.
8726152	8733037	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way.
8733037	8735619	Yes, we are on YouTube now, but it is just the podcast.
8735619	8737961	It's just the audio with the static video.
8737961	8744746	If you want to see the actual video, you do have to be a subscriber of our Twitch channel over at VOG Network.
8744746	8745987	That's it.
8745987	8746848	That's all I've got.
8746848	8747829	So let's get final thoughts.
8747829	8750431	DarkSakura, oh, you were not streaming tonight, but we'll still start with you.
8751328	8756150	Yeah, I'm really, really tired.
8756150	8763212	But I had a great time playing pinball and all of y'all should play more pinball.
8763212	8765733	I will get on that immediately.
8765733	8769134	All right, Loki, your final thought?
8769134	8775677	My final thought is hopefully I will get some more work done on the theme park this week.
8775677	8776577	It's coming along.
8777588	8779069	Nice.
8779069	8782371	My final thought I am looking forward to vacation.
8782371	8786814	I kind of can't believe it's in like three days, but I'm very much looking forward to it.
8786814	8788515	I'm looking forward to seeing friends having fun.
8788515	8790717	It'll be a good time.
8790717	8791517	What up Chicago?
8791517	8792238	See you in three days.
8792238	8792598	I'm excited.
8792598	8795060	My first visit since the Panini so excited.
8796101	8797083	Happy gaming.
8797083	8798665	There's a lot of stuff coming out this week.
8798665	8803995	And again, as we were talking about earlier in the show, probably all the old shit you've been playing probably got remixed at some point.
8803995	8805457	So enjoy gaming.
8805457	8806319	Happy gaming.
8806319	8807701	Happy catching up on your backlog.
8809838	8811119	Enjoy your couple weeks.
8811119	8812339	We'll be back.
8812339	8816462	We'll be right into the thick of E3 Memorial time.
8816462	8821404	I don't think we will have hit any press conferences yet by the next show or will we?
8821404	8822725	What date would the next show be?
8822725	8824266	The next show will be June 2nd.
8824266	8828048	So I don't think we hit any pressers yet, but we'll be right before it.
8828048	8831209	So we'll kind of have a view of what everything's going to look like that week.
8831209	8832790	So that'll be fun.
8832790	8833891	All right.
8833891	8834711	That's it.
8834711	8835451	We'll see you next time.
8835451	8837332	Thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
