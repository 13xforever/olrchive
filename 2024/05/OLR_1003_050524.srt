1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,456
[SPEAKER_01]: As a data maintainer myself, I extend immense empathy to OpenStreetMap's maintainers over their database being ravaged by individuals for the sake of becoming Pokemon masters.

2
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:25,403
[SPEAKER_01]: A database that seeks to map and describe the real world is having its data manipulated in order for users to pad their Pokedex without having to leave their homes or other places of frequent existence.

3
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:28,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Ash's journey would have been a lot easier if he rewrote the world around him.

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,906
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the end's Justify the Means headline.

5
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:34,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting right now on the show, wherever a gamer has a voice,

7
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:48,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:54,987
[SPEAKER_03]: We're live once again with episode number 1003 for tonight, May the 5th of 2024.

10
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Cinco de Mayo to those that are

11
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:03,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Revenge of the Fifth

12
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:32,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the different places will do different ones, but I'll be perfectly honest, I'd rather leave my memory.

13
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:46,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have DVDs of the theatrical releases of the original trilogy, and I have the THX remasters without having the extra shit added on Laserdisc.

14
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:59,760
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeRite in our chat, because we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And OrangeRite in our chat says, eh, it's probably better than episode two.

16
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode two did have that pretty bitchin' Yoda lightsaber fight, though.

17
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,448
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the whole reason to see episode two.

18
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:11,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, yeah, you're probably right.

19
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:16,553
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the most weird CG.

20
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably it's not aged well at all.

21
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:23,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it wasn't even aged well when it was new.

22
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:29,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, this looks like I'm watching a Muppet on a green screen.

23
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Which guess what?

24
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a digital Muppet on a green screen.

25
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Muppets.

26
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:36,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gonna be the name of my band.

27
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat pointing out episode one was 25 years ago.

28
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice round number.

29
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that thought didn't occur to me.

30
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:46,976
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that you bring that up, I'm, I'm a little upset.

31
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:51,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in college when episode one came out.

32
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I was in Chico State and we went to the big theater downtown, the El Rey.

33
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if it's still there.

34
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:59,466
[SPEAKER_03]: For all I know, they've bulldozed it at this point.

35
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:05,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were in the very, very, very last row, way at the fucking top of the theater.

36
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:09,254
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those like old school auditoriums with like 500 seats.

37
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:11,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a single screen theater type of thing.

38
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,296
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all the way in the back.

39
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:13,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were at a midnight showing.

40
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:15,699
[SPEAKER_03]: The One and Only Techmaster Loki!

41
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he taking care of people?

42
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:40,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

43
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:46,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best meme I saw in the Star Trek community, because, you know, people always want to start a fight between Star Trek and Star Wars.

44
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:48,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not interested in starting a fight.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the nicest meme I saw was the the the Klingon meme that said glory to the other franchise today.

46
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was nice.

47
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:57,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

48
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:58,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice sentiment.

49
00:03:58,102 --> 00:03:59,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

50
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there was a

51
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Russ did a video as a Vulcan take on Star Wars.

52
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:12,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see that.

53
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:14,264
[SPEAKER_06]: He was Tuvok for those who don't know.

54
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:14,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

55
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:21,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's also the We Ain't Found Shit guy in Spaceballs, which in some ways was almost a more notable role.

56
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:22,465
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I love Tuvok.

57
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:23,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Voyager.

58
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:24,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing around, but yeah.

59
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:26,707
[SPEAKER_03]: R2-D2, Star Trek

60
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, anyway, Tigerclaw in our chat is asking, so Loki, you've got a sort of Sonic game playing in the background, because if you are watching live, you do get to see us, you know, taping over Discord and you see our video and all that good stuff.

61
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:05,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I, we can see like your background, which to hide your kitchen, Loki, you do like a little video game in the background, uh, that plays.

62
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my digital green screen.

63
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:07,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Your digital green screen.

64
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:09,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, what is this game that we're looking at tonight?

65
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,521
[SPEAKER_02]: DrRobotnik's Ring Racers

66
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to check that out.

67
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:32,960
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a lot of fun.

68
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:43,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf is talking about the R2D2 shirt that says, I wear that shirt all the time when I'm out and about, but not at Dragon Con, because everyone has them.

70
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:44,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Fact.

71
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:45,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has that shirt at Dragon Con.

72
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely wearing that shirt whenever I go to Galaxy's Edge.

73
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:50,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

74
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:50,706
Perfect.

75
00:05:54,286 --> 00:06:09,624
[SPEAKER_03]: rest in peace to the Star Trek experience at what used to be the Hilton I don't even think it's the Hilton anymore in Vegas I think it's called something else in Vegas that's I miss that experience and I would have worn the shirt there if it was still a thing so all right

76
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to get into our show tonight.

77
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:16,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode number 1003, if you can believe it.

78
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:18,269
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some stuff going on in gaming.

79
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,829
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people talking about this first topic tonight.

80
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:25,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's jump right into the topic that's got a lot of people, especially depending on where you live.

81
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,251
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people pretty heated this week.

82
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on?

83
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

84
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:37,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, Sony has now their wording removed the grace period with

85
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:44,818
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to have a PSN account linked to your

86
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:48,969
[SPEAKER_02]: player in Helldivers.

87
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:54,550
[SPEAKER_02]: During launch, they had it where you can link either your Steam account or your PlayStation Network account.

88
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it has to be a PlayStation Network account.

89
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is with that is one, people don't want to do that.

90
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:05,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they don't necessarily have a PlayStation Network account.

91
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:12,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, not every single region in the world has PlayStation Network access.

92
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:18,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could have, say, purchased that in a part of the world that doesn't have that.

93
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:21,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're out of luck.

94
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy your paperweight.

95
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:27,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, folks have been very upset about that.

96
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even a paperweight.

97
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an e-paperweight.

98
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:32,328
[SPEAKER_02]: E-paperweight.

99
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's holding down your e-paper.

100
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:34,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

101
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,143
[SPEAKER_06]: your ebank statement.

102
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:57,363
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, games are coming out for $70 and they're coming out unfinished and all this stuff.

103
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now it's overwhelmingly negative on Steam for one.

104
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And then who could have ever guessed that would happen?

105
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Who could have ever guessed that that would happen?

106
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:15,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just, you know, there's a lot of people that are just against it now.

107
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,460
[SPEAKER_02]: They're review bombing it.

108
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,323
[SPEAKER_02]: They are uninstalling it.

109
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's, it's ridiculous.

110
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did Sony think was going to happen?

111
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:25,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

112
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,461
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they think was going to happen?

113
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:32,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that they would be able to, I could announce, enjoy the Sony network as well.

114
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to buy more games.

115
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:43,438
[SPEAKER_03]: No, uh, they, they were expecting that they would be able to announce at their next shareholder meeting that, wow, we suddenly had a spike in people creating PlayStation accounts, you know,

116
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:53,543
[SPEAKER_03]: People are saying that sales of the PlayStation 5 are slowing, but look, wow, our presence increasing on PC is driving engagement on PlayStation Network.

117
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all these new accounts and all these new people getting the app and blah, blah, blah.

118
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that happening?

119
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:01,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll find out.

120
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine it will happen to some scale, actually.

121
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's going to be a lot of people

122
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:21,527
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the US, Canada, Europe, the places where, you know, Sony does exist that don't follow gaming news as closely that are just gonna, oh, I have to play, do this to make it with my friend, whatever.

123
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,629
[SPEAKER_03]: This takes me five seconds to create an email, whatever, sign.

124
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not reading the terms of agreement done.

125
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:35,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way, I mean, we won't know until the earnings call, but yeah, I think it will work to an extent, but will it be worth the backlash?

126
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the real question we're going to find out, I guess.

127
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:45,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but no one's gonna trust them in the future if they ever do anything, you know, along the same lines started off the same way.

128
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:50,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a big kick in their brand balls.

129
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:58,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you live in one of the countries, most of them seem to be in Africa, where Steam exists, but PlayStation does not.

130
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:06,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course, you're gonna question buying any Sony product in the future, even the first party games that don't require PSNs for now.

131
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just, I don't know, how integral is this to the function of this product in the first place?

132
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it really necessary that we have this account set up?

133
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:23,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this just to like, you know, pad the numbers or whatever?

134
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:28,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're they're claiming it's security, but I claim.

135
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:34,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, because all the steam games are so unsecure, you know, it's it's not possible to, you know, add any sort of security.

136
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:45,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I now the benefit the benefit of the doubt I could probably give was maybe some sort of cross play thing behind the scenes, but the game's already functioning.

137
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:49,746
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not correct, if I'm mistaken, the game is already functioning with cross play, right?

138
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not like something they're working on it.

139
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:55,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure that really because it's like, well, then you're doing it now.

140
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do you need this to make that happen?

141
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:02,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I would maybe have understood that if crossplay wasn't there yet.

142
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:09,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always in the name of security, like everything, even patching out hacks or exploits on consoles is in the name of security.

143
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:13,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when they talk about that stuff.

144
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know if

145
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:17,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.

146
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:25,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, especially especially if you're looking at, you know, we had OK, let me put it this way.

147
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:32,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were going to do this, obviously they knew that they were going to do this because they said this was a grace period.

148
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I assume that they took the proper precautions not to sell this game in territories that didn't have access to the PlayStation Network.

149
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:44,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously, because they're only turning that around now.

150
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:45,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

151
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because obviously they must not have, you know, done that.

152
00:11:48,524 --> 00:12:02,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, on the other hand, if they did do that and sold essentially was something that they knew that was going to be shut down after a few weeks of service, then then I think those people are do a refund.

153
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,605
[SPEAKER_02]: If not a class action lawsuit against you, because that's ridiculous to sell a broken product.

154
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:14,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but how's a class action lawsuit going to work when it sees it's not the US is not being affected?

155
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets complicated because you'd have to live in one of these affected countries and you'd have to sue a US company.

156
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be I would wonder if maybe people would go after Steam.

157
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the smarter strategy if you're a pissed off consumer.

158
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:31,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize this is not Steam's fault.

159
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:32,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be clear.

160
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,087
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not Steam's fault.

161
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:47,615
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't sue Target for selling a bed that the manufacturer has, I don't know, recalled a piece on.

162
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:49,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.

163
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:57,243
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems weird that it's like, well, now this game that I bought on Steam has a restriction that didn't exist in the beginning.

164
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:57,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

165
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:58,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

166
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:02,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, people- Bobby is saying in chat that Steam's offering a lot of refunds.

167
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:02,806
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.

168
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:08,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say, you can ask Steam for a refund and people are getting them eventually.

169
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I understand it, people are not always getting them right away either.

170
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:18,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this also should have been once this was announced and this loophole was discovered, this should be an open and shut thing.

171
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody in those affected countries should honestly be automatically refunded.

172
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:26,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't be something you have to ask for.

173
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not going to happen.

174
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:33,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if people are willing to hold on to a digital paperweight, then so be it.

175
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:37,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Both companies would love to pocket that money.

176
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:38,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, it's gonna be interesting to see.

178
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby says steam is legally covered.

179
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So steam is legally covered as a follow up to the refund comment.

180
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:56,837
[SPEAKER_03]: What it all it would take is one person getting the denial one time though, to then have something to go back.

181
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you ask one time to get told no, you could

182
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,222
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, escalated if you really wanted to.

183
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:07,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I just don't know how practical that is when you consider it's international at this point.

184
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:17,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're talking about companies that exist in the U.S., Japan, and then whatever other country is, you know, involved that may actually escalate it to this.

185
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:28,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I think because of that reason, it goes nowhere and legally and it does end up, you know, the the court of public opinion, so to speak, as based on the steam reviews.

186
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:36,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll just be interesting to see what happens.

187
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:46,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I do also agree with something Bobby said that Steam would also say the PSN requirement was visible on the store page.

188
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:49,290
[SPEAKER_06]: If people decide not to read it.

189
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,990
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

190
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I would still say, though, there's a case to say why you sold a product that you knew wouldn't work for me.

191
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:57,136
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

192
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a lawyer.

193
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:02,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody on this panel is a lawyer.

194
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:08,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just I'm just, I've certainly seen enough of these wild lawsuits that come up over stranger things.

195
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just it just wouldn't surprise me.

196
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:11,450
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

197
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's Steam's fault.

198
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:17,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also don't think these folks in other countries should just be forced to take it.

199
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,256
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's like you get it.

200
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the frustrating thing.

201
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:22,118
[SPEAKER_03]: What other recourse is there?

202
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if there is no case legally, well, that fucking sucks.

203
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what other recourse is there?

204
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:32,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're sick of this shit time and time again, right?

205
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:45,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we see these fat fucking companies making these decisions that affect swaths of fans in other countries, and there's literally nothing they can do about it.

206
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:47,445
[SPEAKER_03]: This sucks.

207
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:51,546
[SPEAKER_05]: There are recourses if the

208
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:56,534
[SPEAKER_06]: countries themselves bring it up in international business court?

209
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:59,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have to get France to bail us out of this one too?

210
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:06,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I seem to remember that was a strategy on a prior thing, was going to France, who has the strictest laws.

211
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Can France bail us all out too?

212
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not a lawyer either, but I've taken several law courses that were associated with my degree.

213
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:23,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying, I got a bit of... I at least know about reading contracts and loopholes in contracts and things like that.

214
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I'm not, again, not an expert, but I do have the credits.

215
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:38,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I was saying is that if it is there... Oh, and you should have seen me try to read the RuPaul's Drag Race contract.

216
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:39,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Hoo, that thing's evil.

217
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

218
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:55,842
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's stated there in the contract without anything else there to refute it, whether or not somebody reads it, the liability is still on the part of the signer, not the one who issued the document.

219
00:16:56,662 --> 00:17:09,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless there was... They could bring in for misleading verbiage in there, but they have professionals that read over this before they put the thing out.

220
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end of the game, I mean, it's...

221
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:16,545
[SPEAKER_06]: read it before you sign it.

222
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:20,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even with mortgages, you know, yeah, you get three day right of rescission.

223
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,527
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing.

224
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:28,509
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, once that right of rescission has passed, you have read the document, no matter what's in it, you are legally bound to it.

225
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:40,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so assumably, these professionals would have caught this loophole that, oh, you are going to sell a product in these countries that is effectively going to be inoperable.

226
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:51,258
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on Sony's dollar, of course they're gonna... All they have to do, all their job is, they're not there for the ethics of it.

227
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:54,419
[SPEAKER_06]: They are there for two reasons.

228
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:03,163
[SPEAKER_06]: One, to legally make sure that the company is not held accountable for any fallout that comes based on the terms of that legal agreement.

229
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:10,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And secondly, to make sure that that legal agreement is sound and has no conflicting language in it.

230
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:17,615
[SPEAKER_06]: and that it can fall within, you know, whatever business law dictates.

231
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:28,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since I guess there's no other option than the court of public opinion, I would encourage these folks to take their negative reviews and apply them to all of the Sony games on Steam.

232
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Why stop with Helldivers?

233
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:40,170
[SPEAKER_03]: You should, if you really want to get them, get on the next Sony game before it releases or right at day one when it releases and get on those negative reviews.

234
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,691
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my suggestion.

235
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:43,533
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have to find Dirty, find Dirty.

236
00:18:46,275 --> 00:19:01,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on the PlayStation, PlayStation games, studio games.

237
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

238
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:10,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling banning of players that engage in this type of behavior.

239
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:16,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It also allows those players that have been banned to have the right to repeal or to an appeal.

240
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:19,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So they already had that though.

241
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

242
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam has that though as well.

243
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:22,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, how is this necessarily

244
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Improving gameplay.

245
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:31,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they saying that, well, Steam is a hellhole and this is the only semblance of order?

246
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:37,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if that's the Helldivers right there... Why spoil it on the platform if they have no confidence in the platform?

247
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:52,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the universe is just a rabid and awful uncivilized place and we're here to bring democracy by making you... Don't think that I agree with what Sony did.

248
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:53,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that

249
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I follow the logic of it.

250
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:00,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's always going to be the take I'm going to go.

251
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:04,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can empathize with people and say, yeah, it sucks that you're in this situation.

252
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:09,966
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the long run, you know, how many server closures have we seen?

253
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:15,588
[SPEAKER_06]: How many, you know, games that come out and then instantly, you know, don't sell.

254
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they shut it down.

255
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:21,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is a lot of just business.

256
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I even think that maybe a degree of IP protection.

257
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,033
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's Sony wanting to keep the control in-house.

258
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Then don't put it on Steam, then.

259
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:32,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

260
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, sorry, you don't get Steam sales, then.

261
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,098
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have it both ways.

262
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:38,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to sell your game, but you also don't want to play by the rules.

263
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:42,504
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was getting to, what I was saying.

264
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:49,750
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if they want to maintain that kind of control, then they need to have it on a platform that only they control.

265
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,150
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

266
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:54,763
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's exactly what I was getting to.

267
00:20:54,763 --> 00:21:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's too lazy to put out their own store on the PC, so I guess, I don't know.

268
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:10,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make financial sense for them if the, you know, and they've had a working relationship with Steam before for, you know, the Final Fantasy games.

269
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:20,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It very well could just possibly be that this is something that they were trying and it's gonna, you know, five, six days from now, you know, a week,

270
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:29,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see them going, oh, we see how, you know, we've listened to our fans and we we love you and what you have to say and then reverse it.

271
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:37,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee that it having the PlayStation Network account is not going to fix any hacking that's being done in the game already.

272
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:46,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Being that they say outright in the actual little blurb that they put out that it's freaking easy to set up a PlayStation Network account.

273
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:51,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's free and easy for me to set up multiple PlayStation Network accounts is essentially what you're telling me.

274
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:54,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, I don't see how that's going to prevent

275
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:59,740
[SPEAKER_02]: people from banning or hacking or whatever the case may be with this.

276
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I think a lot of people are just like, nah, I'm not doing this.

277
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a library of 800 games I got to be playing.

278
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:11,146
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if if I really don't like this and this is bothering me so much that I'm just going to outright not do it.

279
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:16,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you take the reviews in your game, which was doing well.

280
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is going to financially hurt them at some point.

281
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully they learned their lesson that maybe like be a little agnostic with it.

282
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:45,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster with an interesting follow-up of sorts in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, while this is going on, Sucker Punch was spotted a day or two ago with a tweet affirming that the director's cut of Ghost of Tsushima for PCs, which comes out later this month, won't require a PSN account for single-player, but will for multiplayer functions.

283
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:56,488
[SPEAKER_03]: there, we'll see that whole thing where I was like, you know, if you really want to show you're mad at Sony, go start review bombing other Sony games, like go go scorched earth on Sony period.

284
00:22:56,488 --> 00:23:10,277
[SPEAKER_03]: This tweet is trying to prevent some of that is trying to make it like basically like very clear, like you don't need it for single player, you know, you do like try to get out in front of a lot of that is what they're trying to do with this, which understandably so.

285
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I understand it, Sony if they wanted to could also change this on a whim if they wanted to.

286
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:20,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they will, especially in light of this, but they could.

287
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:25,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to go ahead and just say this as for myself.

288
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:30,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that it's a good idea to encourage anybody to review BOM for any reason.

289
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Review the game based on the game.

290
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:35,774
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it's a good game, it's a good game.

291
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:39,616
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you all are fucked and have no recourse whatsoever.

292
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You have nothing you can do about it.

293
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit there and take it.

294
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:43,499
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

295
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:48,359
[SPEAKER_06]: There is such a thing as writing letters.

296
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And if and companies, they I mean, there usually is a business response policy.

297
00:23:54,184 --> 00:24:06,513
[SPEAKER_06]: But the best way to make your voice, you know, heard on this one is do the legwork, write the letters, you know, send it to the people who are in the power to do something about it for you.

298
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:10,536
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, folks in the mailroom are just going to love that and they're going to throw it in the trash.

299
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:11,797
[SPEAKER_06]: That does not happen.

300
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:14,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It is legally not permissible to happen.

301
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:17,631
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to be read by somebody and there has to be a response.

302
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:20,932
[SPEAKER_06]: The impact will be seen.

303
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:27,456
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it was Helldivers or otherwise.

304
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with DarkSakura.

305
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:31,539
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

306
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:37,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I played... My Avatar game finally came back up, so I was really happy about that.

307
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:38,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Dead by Daylight.

308
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:41,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Dracula X

309
00:24:50,462 --> 00:25:01,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually kept playing after my stream was over just so I could get the Yotsutsuna, which people don't really like because of the defense drop, but it's like fast and you shred everything in front of you.

310
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:04,207
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need defense when you got a good offense.

311
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:07,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

312
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also played Just Dance.

313
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:13,570
[SPEAKER_06]: because Shiley made me.

314
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Fuck It Friday last night.

315
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:16,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Not last night, but Friday night.

316
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

317
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:22,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had to play Just Dance and we played Jackbox 7.

318
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:25,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had some fun.

319
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:32,522
[SPEAKER_06]: There was, you know, some some adult beverages involved and my friends over and that was really great.

320
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:36,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I love I love the some of the Jackbox games now, although

321
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:45,826
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people really like to submit the word vibrator as a suggestion.

322
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:52,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be appropriate for the next Jackbox.

323
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:53,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I played.

324
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:54,415
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki.

325
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:58,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I played all Minecraft this week.

326
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:01,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I put out a video, so I built an arcade with a DDR machine.

327
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:05,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mind mind revolution game.

328
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the video.

329
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

330
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:08,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very.

331
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:08,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

332
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:13,266
[SPEAKER_03]: As usual, way more than I would expect way more detailed than it had any right to be.

333
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

334
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:19,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so that's what I've been spending time with this week.

335
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:24,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's still trying to get back to working on the theme park ride stuff.

336
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did work on that a bit.

337
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the middle, I played some of the MCC Island stuff to try to run in.

338
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:41,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we were playing with some of our listeners and I guess viewers.

339
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:42,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were

340
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:49,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Also trying to bump into some of the people practicing for the new MCC tournament that was yesterday.

341
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:53,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see Cub, our coach.

342
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:58,997
[SPEAKER_02]: He popped into the tab screen for a sec and then was off doing practice.

343
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was fun.

344
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:06,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to play Rocket Spleef Rush again, which I haven't played that since MCC.

345
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've changed it now, so it's a little harder.

346
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun game.

347
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:15,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking forward to hopefully them adding more stuff to the island at some point.

348
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:16,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Ace Race.

349
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:17,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

350
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:21,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they get that there someday because that was a lot of fun to play Mario Kart.

351
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Minecraft, Minecraft, like parkour, I guess.

352
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:28,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so that's pretty much my week.

353
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:33,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I don't think I played any of.

354
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:33,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock.

355
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:35,848
[SPEAKER_02]: TurboKid

356
00:27:46,532 --> 00:28:06,119
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was honestly mostly Diablo 4 of all things and the reason why is because there's you know the season event going on and the season's over in like 10 days because there's a big new patch coming out for season 4 it's gonna really affect itemization in the game which is a huge sticking point for a lot of players right now so

357
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,960
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

358
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:41,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I will get there though there's 90 tiers of the battle pass and I hit 69 today literally did so I think I'll get there because there's a lot of they do this thing where

359
00:28:42,785 --> 00:29:09,613
[SPEAKER_03]: you get a little bit of credit for like everything you do in the world every monster you kill every you know dungeon you finish but then there's some other like quests that they call like the season journey and as you tick things off on the quest you kind of get a big chunk of uh you know a level or something like that so i'm really close to there's been a few that's been a bit of a grind but i'm really close to ticking the boxes on a few of those so that'll uh that'll really help so

360
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:23,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully by this time next week, I'm going to be sitting here going yay, I got I finished my battle pass and I don't feel as clownery for spending the money on the battle pass in advance because I think I got everything in it.

361
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:30,907
[SPEAKER_03]: But I there's also something I noticed was that they have not been offering tier skips through Amazon Prime this time.

362
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:37,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's how I was able to get ahead a little bit was that Prime Gaming gave me at least like 10 tier skips last time around.

363
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:40,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And I they didn't give the give us that this time.

364
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:59,758
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did notice, I didn't even know this was a thing until I was just very randomly somehow in the Microsoft points thing, the reward points, you know, applications, seeing ways you could spend them because I think I saw that Diablo 4 was in there and I was like, oh, I was curious if you could like buy a battle pass maybe through your reward points.

365
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:04,879
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you can buy tier skips with your Microsoft reward points in Diablo 4.

366
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, that's an interesting sort of Blizzard and Microsoft synergy thing.

367
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:14,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think existed before Microsoft bought them.

368
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:16,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a ridiculous value.

369
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:20,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They want something like 1700 points for two tier skips, which is not worth it.

370
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought I just thought that was interesting that that's something you could spend them on if you wanted to now.

371
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:32,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep saving up for the gift card that gives me a month of game pass free, because I think that's the best value for me personally.

372
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:32,638
[SPEAKER_03]: But

373
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,481
[SPEAKER_03]: thought that was interesting that you can buy.

374
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:43,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, this is an interesting sort of Microsoft and Blizzard thing since the purchase that I hadn't heard about otherwise.

375
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:44,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is interesting.

376
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was really just that.

377
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:48,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV a little bit as well.

378
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:51,139
[SPEAKER_03]: My ninja got to level 90, which is the max level in the game.

379
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So I only have three classes left to get to max level.

380
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Warrior, Monk, and Dragoon.

381
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragoon's about halfway there.

382
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:59,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working on Dragoon lately.

383
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and dying in a lot of fights because I'm a Dragoon and that's what they do.

384
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So, good times.

385
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,432
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we got some more stories coming for you.

386
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:13,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking in chat, Mike Depp says, a friend does the Microsoft Rewards thing almost religiously.

387
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:15,357
[SPEAKER_03]: He has gotten a lot of stuff out of it for sure.

388
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:22,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be a little more on it when I was playing my Series X more because they had, they just shut it down not that long ago, they had that app.

389
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

390
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:50,775
[SPEAKER_03]: every other month I was getting Game Pass for free when I was doing it.

391
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they took away a lot of methods to get points.

392
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:56,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's still a lot out there.

393
00:31:56,259 --> 00:32:02,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure it's it feels like some really weird version of extreme couponing.

394
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:07,627
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find all these different coupons and ways to get points, you can get these free rewards.

395
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:10,229
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what people are doing like defs friends.

396
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So interesting.

397
00:32:12,622 --> 00:32:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, a lot of other stuff that's been happening in the industry this week.

398
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:22,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an interesting development from Loki.

399
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:26,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't.

400
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:28,149
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the world become nowadays?

401
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:30,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's the question we really should be asking ourselves.

402
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:52,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave and Buster's, for those who are not aware, is a restaurant chain that's kind of think of like an adult Chuck E. Cheese that's got an arcade with like lots of redemption games plus they serve alcohol and they have a, instead of turning in tickets for things you can get on Xbox or I guess that's kind of all arcades nowadays that have redemption.

403
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:53,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Or most of the drinkware in my kitchen.

404
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:58,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or like what Jamie said.

405
00:32:58,115 --> 00:33:03,516
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, now, don't worry if you're using that as an escape to get away from gambling.

406
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:06,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, gambling was just following you right there.

407
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:14,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dave and Buster is going to allow you to to place friendly wagers on various games using their app.

408
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:21,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've partnered with Lucra, a gambling software company, to power their wager system.

409
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it's going to allow you to

410
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:38,802
[SPEAKER_02]: bet on skill based games and Lucrez said, of course, just to clarify that, hey, we're not running afoul of the law because you have to do that in great ideas like this.

411
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:44,023
[SPEAKER_02]: They said skill based games are not subject to the same rules and regulations as slot machines or other types of gambling.

412
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:50,605
[SPEAKER_02]: The company is careful not to use specific terms like bet or wager when talking about its software.

413
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:54,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, they use real money contests or challenges.

414
00:33:57,165 --> 00:34:01,731
[SPEAKER_03]: There's yeah, it's gambling hurt in the line, aren't they?

415
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:12,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like, when I originally heard about this, I thought, oh, maybe they're gambling tickets, you know, because you have a ticket balance on your card, and maybe you can make sure that would make sense.

416
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:13,968
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, this is legit money.

417
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, like, first off, number one, where is the the need for this?

418
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:31,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know, like, I have never gone to an arcade and like bet someone money to do something like that has never crossed my mind at all.

419
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:32,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one.

420
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:40,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, let's say a work going to do that in a conventional sense, you would have cash on hand to do that.

421
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:42,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I use your stupid app to do that?

422
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

423
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:45,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's

424
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Solving a problem that's not there.

425
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also in introducing something that is a bit of irritating, if you ask me.

426
00:34:54,091 --> 00:35:01,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like preying on people's egos, because there's a lot of people that would go, Oh, I can win money from making the basket shot.

427
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:03,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah, I'm a basketball pro.

428
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:03,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do this.

429
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:04,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.

430
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:04,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

431
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:05,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah.

432
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:11,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Not realizing that, you know, the basket rims are usually different as well as the ball sizes and those types of, you know, things.

433
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:14,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all and sometimes they're even tilted a little bit.

434
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:15,995
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all sorts of little... They're mid

435
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:16,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Codeway Games

436
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,075
[SPEAKER_02]: and DJ Ranma S

437
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:56,211
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whoever wins gets $5.

438
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:59,974
[SPEAKER_03]: When you cash it out, they have to take cut, I'm sure, or something.

439
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:06,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does the money then turn into credits or gift card money or something that- Or that maybe you pay a flat rate?

440
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they show you how to cash it out?

441
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

442
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:10,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really say.

443
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It says- Let's see here.

444
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:15,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's real money wagers.

445
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:23,171
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a lot of questions that still need answering that I don't think we're really going to know until we actually see one of these go live in a Dave and Buster's.

446
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:29,592
[SPEAKER_03]: But I personally, I haven't set foot in a Dave and Buster's and it was at least before the pandemic was the last time.

447
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:34,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I don't see myself rushing to check it out.

448
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:37,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that one that new one in Folsom finally open?

449
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:37,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's open.

450
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

451
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:42,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we drove by it going to Lucille's.

452
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:42,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave's Closet

453
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:05,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's there's this aquarium called SeaQuest.

454
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:06,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awful.

455
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:07,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go there.

456
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's but it is there in the Palladio.

457
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:14,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea this was a thing.

458
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:15,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's awful.

459
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:17,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like, ooh, aquarium.

460
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go to it and you're like,

461
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:25,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all manta rays and it's just the fish and there's farm animals in each other.

462
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:33,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently like if you like actually research sea quests and like there's a ton of like bad things about them.

463
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:36,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just really not worth going to.

464
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:40,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had no I was excited to see Dave and Buster's.

465
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,122
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know, they have no card now and it's just the

466
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:48,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the app.

467
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:50,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's done through the app now.

468
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

469
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:58,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll stick to round one, honestly, which I mean, SSJ100 Matt says in chat, just go to round one and play the claw games.

470
00:37:58,483 --> 00:37:58,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

471
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:12,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the claw games are interesting because in a way it's but see, it's, it's not betting the same way but it is it's like, you know, you only get rewarded if you have skill, you know, which, you know,

472
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:18,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you know how to work a claw game, you might have a better chance or whatever.

473
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Still RNG and skill kind of together, but at least that makes sense.

474
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:26,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, this is just predatory.

475
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've been calling these ticket spitter things gambling for kids for years.

476
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:31,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's just gambling.

477
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:32,898
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

478
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:34,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now it's Gambler for Adults.

479
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:35,439
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

480
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should those aren't skill based?

481
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,861
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking about.

482
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:48,265
[SPEAKER_06]: The like, like I just said, the skeeballs and the basketballs and maybe some whack-a-mole and some Cosmo gang, I don't know.

483
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:54,048
[SPEAKER_03]: They will keep pushing the line more and more and more until some regulatory agency comes in and smacks it.

484
00:38:54,788 --> 00:39:04,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure California, New York, one of these states, when this goes hot, is going to be right up this thing's ass.

485
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:07,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Or possibly even legislating around it.

486
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:15,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen states legislate business practices out of existence, such as what California has been trying to do to clear at the airports, right?

487
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so this company Lucra also is partnered with, I mean, they've also

488
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Duper, Pickleball Rating System, Tennis One

489
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:41,519
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time, it's never required an app.

490
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't need to require an app now.

491
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't understand what the point is with this.

492
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:47,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have cash on you to bet people, guess what?

493
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:48,943
[SPEAKER_02]: The app is the shark.

494
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:49,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.

495
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,165
[SPEAKER_03]: The app is the shark that makes sure you pay up.

496
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:55,066
[SPEAKER_06]: The app is the invisible money you don't know you're spending.

497
00:39:55,066 --> 00:40:00,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that is a absolutely 100% that is a huge part of it.

498
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:04,831
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't actually hand physical money over, it doesn't feel the same.

499
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:05,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

500
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:06,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

501
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

502
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:22,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, physical exchanges are very important to some people, which is why some people like to buy games from Limited Run Games and get to experience classic games, sometimes newer games, indie games, a lot of classic games that are getting a second print or Limited Run.

503
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:33,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But Limited Run is in some hot water this week because, uh-oh, apparently some 3DO games were shipping on CDRs.

504
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:38,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like they were just burned in a computer and then went to somebody's house.

505
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:41,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not great.

506
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:52,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've actually responded already with a statement saying, we've been made aware that some of our customers have experienced issues and trying to play our release of D the collector's edition on original 3DO hardware.

507
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:56,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to apologize unreservedly to all who have purchased the game and experienced an issue.

508
00:40:57,512 --> 00:41:00,856
[SPEAKER_03]: At Limited Run, the quality of our products is paramount to us.

509
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:06,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We care deeply about our loyal community, and it is clear on this occasion that we have fallen short of the high standards we set for ourselves.

510
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:11,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Manufacturing games for hardware that's 30 years old presents a variety of challenges.

511
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:19,134
[SPEAKER_03]: We partner with one of the biggest disc replication providers in North America to press our physical discs, and despite researching hardware and software extensively,

512
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:24,436
[SPEAKER_03]: We found quality and reliability issues when attempting to press 3DO discs in the traditional manner.

513
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:37,343
[SPEAKER_03]: In an attempt to offer full compatibility with original hardware, our disc replication partner was able to successfully manufacture the discs using a CD-R format, which we believed would work across all commercially available 3DO systems.

514
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:43,406
[SPEAKER_03]: This process was professionally done and was used to ensure maximum compatibility rather than serve as a cost-cutting exercise.

515
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:45,327
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very interesting how they're explaining themselves here.

516
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We tested the discs on the 3DO consoles in our office and all 5 discs from the game worked as expected.

517
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:58,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only upon shipping to our customers that we came to realize that some users were experiencing difficulty.

518
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:05,033
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not be selling or shipping further copies of this game or any future 3DO titles until the situation has been resolved.

519
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,554
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working with new partners.

520
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:11,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be assured that D, The Collector's Edition, is the only game affected by this issue.

521
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:14,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Further titles will not go into production until this is resolved.

522
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:23,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is interesting that, you know, a lot of folks are reporting on the original story about how, you know, the things, you know, the production, the incident happened.

523
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:27,048
[SPEAKER_03]: But that statement is interesting in putting things to perspective where they're claiming

524
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:36,670
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whether it is or isn't true, they're claiming that they had to go with CDRs because that was the only way they could get it to work on a mass scale on 3DOs.

525
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But surprise, surprise, it didn't work.

526
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:47,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was less that and more of like, they, our manufacturer assured us that this would work, that they tested it, it did work.

527
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:50,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't as expensive as pressing the disc.

528
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:54,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, well, okay, well, we can do that then and it'll be fine.

529
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turned out it wasn't fine.

530
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:56,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So

531
00:42:58,266 --> 00:43:07,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were upfront about it, so... Yeah, I mean, go figure that 3DO has probably anti-piracy built into its console like every other CD console, so...

532
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:15,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interesting comments from around the internets, people not convinced about this explanation here.

533
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:30,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some comments that are coming around from Twitter at Oporpup says, The nature of CDR, which uses a layer of dye higher up in the disc's substrate than a writer etches away to approximate the pits and lands of a compact disc, is something that the 3DO's very primitive and delicate laser

534
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:32,456
[SPEAKER_03]: really will not tolerate.

535
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this from serving them.

536
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:43,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Another user, IamHanyolo says, so you chose CDRs to ensure compatibility on a device notorious for not playing well with CDRs.

537
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't make this stuff up.

538
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:55,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just a bunch of people kind of calling bullshit with this that, you know, they, despite the fact they tested it and it worked, you know, whatever.

539
00:43:55,262 --> 00:43:56,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

540
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:56,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

541
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's kind of lame to have it on a CDR anyways, because

542
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:04,635
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just burn your own copy if that's the case.

543
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:14,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're buying a game from Limited Run because you want it to be a physical copy that is equivalent to the release that it was originally.

544
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like, oh, hey, I burned this on a disc before you made a fancy label for it.

545
00:44:18,104 --> 00:44:21,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, please don't do that.

546
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:27,492
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are making good on their promise to stop 3DO games until they get this figured out.

547
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:35,458
[SPEAKER_03]: sg100mat illustrating this in chat saying, Plumbers Don't Wear Ties, which that was a real 3DO game that's pretty wild.

548
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:40,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Plumbers Don't Wear Ties was going to be a limited run release, but that has been delayed because it was a 3DO release.

549
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:44,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is not happening, at least not right away.

550
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:45,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So, until they figure this out.

551
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:52,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the drawing board and maybe back to testing with a pool of more than five 3DO machines or whatever.

552
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:54,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I get they're hard to find.

553
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:59,754
[SPEAKER_02]: If he's a plumber that doesn't wear ties, then why in the box art is he wearing a tie?

554
00:44:59,754 --> 00:45:01,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confused.

555
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:03,116
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't make sense.

556
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:04,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he not a plumber?

557
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:08,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find out eventually, but it's going to be delayed a little bit.

558
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wait, I thought you were supposed to be here to plumb my pipes and now you have a tie on.

559
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:18,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, clearly you're not meant for this job.

560
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:24,568
[SPEAKER_03]: 3DO is one of those systems that just kind of came and went, and I don't think I ever touched one, except maybe at a Sears kiosk.

561
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:27,489
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell 3DO at Sears, Montgomery Ward, one of those.

562
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:30,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe a kiosk at one of those stores is the only time I ever played a 3DO.

563
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:32,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, no.

564
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:36,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, the game is about why he shouldn't wear a tie.

565
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:38,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so it's one of those instructional safety videos.

566
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:42,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you wear a tie, you'll get sucked into the paper shredder or something like that.

567
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:43,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

568
00:45:43,772 --> 00:45:44,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

569
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Seuss says we had one.

570
00:45:45,153 --> 00:45:47,114
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a few great titles at least once.

571
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:47,775
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

572
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:49,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.

573
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:50,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

574
00:45:50,777 --> 00:45:52,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be fun to get one and mess around.

575
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,500
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, you can't make your own CDR games.

576
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.

577
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:57,022
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

578
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:57,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on.

579
00:45:57,763 --> 00:45:59,665
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

580
00:45:59,665 --> 00:45:59,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,

581
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:11,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Hasbro has had licensing deals to put out some pretty amazing games.

582
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:15,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, well-performing games, I should say, like Monopoly Go and Baldur's Gate 3.

583
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:22,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they are looking into building their own internal development.

584
00:46:22,598 --> 00:46:37,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The head of product development at Wizards of the Coast, which it's still hard to think of Hasbro owning that, but is really wanting to make the video games now.

585
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:39,830
[SPEAKER_06]: They have four AAA studios.

586
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:45,754
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Atomic Arcade that's doing a Snake Eyes game that's, I guess, it's supposed to be a little bit more adult themed.

587
00:46:47,074 --> 00:47:00,939
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Invoke Studios doing a Dungeons and Dragons, there's Skeleton Key that's doing quote something spooky, and then another one out of Austin called Archetype that has a BioWare

588
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Star, I guess, from Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, whose lead designer, James Olin, is working on a new franchise, Exodus.

589
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:16,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And to quote

590
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:22,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Ayub, who is that, again, head of digital product development.

591
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:23,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot speak words tonight.

592
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:25,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

593
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:26,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll read the quote.

594
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:29,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Hasbro is a hundred year old company and it's built on play.

595
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:33,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always been about play and it's always been about entertaining people.

596
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:36,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And gaming is the predominant form of entertainment for a lot of people.

597
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:39,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something that just continues to grow.

598
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:41,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a lot of ways, it makes sense for Hasbro to be in this space.

599
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:54,956
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're really wanting to just make some very strong games and they really are pushing that Snake Eyes game, so who knows.

600
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'd be interesting to see, you know.

601
00:47:56,577 --> 00:47:57,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they bought Atari.

602
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:04,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'd be interesting to see how Hasbro kind of pushes this forward because obviously Baldur's Gate 3 was, you know, great for them.

603
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:08,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's be we all know that's to Larian's credit, really.

604
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

605
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:13,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not going to be able to duplicate that with Baldur's Gate 4, to which Larian has already said, we're not doing it.

606
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:16,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not interested, you know, that like they're they're doing the thing now.

607
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:20,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Hasbro wants to certainly cut out another type of hit here.

608
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But these, you know, there's some interesting sounding things in here.

609
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be curious.

610
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:25,198
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.

611
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:25,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

612
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:40,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, some of the folks from Atomic Arcade worked on Batman Arkham Asylum, and they're trying to go that route with the Snake Eyes game.

613
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:40,737
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good game.

614
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:44,700
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be pretty good.

615
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,060
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

616
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Very complicated character in the G.I.

617
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:49,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe universe.

618
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:54,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, while Hasbro expands their plans, Loki has some unfortunate news on the other side of the spectrum.

619
00:48:55,592 --> 00:49:02,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's more updates regarding Take-Two and how we talked about it was rationalizing its pipeline and cutting hundreds of jobs.

620
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:03,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

621
00:49:03,914 --> 00:49:06,575
[SPEAKER_02]: $140 million worth of in-development projects?

622
00:49:06,575 --> 00:49:06,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

623
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:12,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think one of the things we forgot about was the indie studios that they own.

624
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:24,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of that, of course, Take-Two has announced that they are planning to lay off 70 people in Seattle with Intercept Games, the makers of Kerbal Space Program 2.

625
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:32,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And also Roll7 in London also said that they were getting laid off as well.

626
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:40,234
[SPEAKER_02]: They were behind the recent, oh what was that, Olly Olly World and Rollerdrome.

627
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:56,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unfortunately, Take-Two has actually said that they plan on making updates to Kerbal Space Program 2, and plans to release Weta Workshops Game Studios Tales of the Shrire, a Lord of the Rings game, the second half.

628
00:49:56,828 --> 00:50:00,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I think actually that was Private Division.

629
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:01,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course,

630
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're just not too happy about being laid off like that.

631
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll7's co-director Simon Bennett told Edge that Olly Olly World was the sequel.

632
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best game we ever made, but it wasn't a totally new IP.

633
00:50:15,906 --> 00:50:19,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a long time since they've been in a headspace.

634
00:50:19,568 --> 00:50:28,675
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is, you know, they said, we're kind of tired of, you know, essentially playing publisher Tinder.

635
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:35,802
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, trying to find new publishers to work with and just being bought up and laid off and stuff like that.

636
00:50:35,802 --> 00:50:36,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sucks.

637
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:39,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they're on to make the next big thing.

638
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:44,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one would hope because God's unfortunate to hear.

639
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:52,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I guess take two is really putting everything into a Grand Theft Auto six being successful, you know, to save putting all your eggs in one basket.

640
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's hope that that's a really good basket that those eggs are in.

641
00:50:55,578 --> 00:50:57,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize there's other stuff too, but it's just I don't know, it's hard.

642
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard not to kind of be like, Oh,

643
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:02,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar Table Tennis is going to pull it out.

644
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That sequel is going to be amazing.

645
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:05,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to revolutionize.

646
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:05,786
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do?

647
00:51:05,786 --> 00:51:08,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar Games presents Pickleball.

648
00:51:08,028 --> 00:51:09,189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the new thing right there.

649
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:09,970
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

650
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:10,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

651
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:15,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was at Target yesterday and Target has a whole fucking pickleball thing up front.

652
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I saw that.

653
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:16,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

654
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:18,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.

655
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:19,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

656
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:25,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in, like, it's, we, every time I go for a walk, you know, the neighborhood park here has pickleball courts and it's just,

657
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:28,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's packed all the time.

658
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:29,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the thing that the olds do.

659
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:36,145
[SPEAKER_03]: When I when I go walking at parks playing Pikmin or Monster Hunter or Pokemon Go or any of that.

660
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:38,446
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always people playing pickleball.

661
00:51:38,446 --> 00:51:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are playing volleyball.

662
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:41,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed these days too.

663
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:42,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of the time of year for that.

664
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And always one person within those groups looking at me funny because I'm on my phone at the park.

665
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:49,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Ma'am

666
00:52:13,843 --> 00:52:16,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Activities, people up out moving around.

667
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:16,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

668
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:19,027
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not and I'm sure some of you in chat play it.

669
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:19,928
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

670
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:24,432
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just it's weird to me how it's just everywhere all of a sudden.

671
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:28,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why is this like the hot new thing?

672
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:28,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

673
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:30,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I don't know.

674
00:52:30,176 --> 00:52:36,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I get and then I get annoyed when people are judging me for being at the park playing the game I want to play.

675
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:37,922
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's the part that annoys me.

676
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:42,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't necessarily judge those people and they shouldn't judge, you know, other people.

677
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:43,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, yeah.

678
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:47,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't judge people for having fun in their own way.

679
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:49,386
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare you have fun?

680
00:52:49,386 --> 00:52:54,390
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's talk about some indie ways to have fun.

681
00:52:54,390 --> 00:53:04,420
[SPEAKER_03]: ID at Xbox happened this last week, and it was a lot of different things that they showed at this event, which happened on Monday.

682
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,744
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's go over some of the big announcements that they gave.

683
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:14,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So Astor, Blade of the Monolith will be coming out on May 30th.

684
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:24,371
[SPEAKER_03]: This was originally a game known as Monolith Requiem of the Ancients, but now this hack and slash ARPG has a new name and will come out on May 30th.

685
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:29,534
[SPEAKER_03]: 33 Immortals will have a closed beta that is starting May 24th.

686
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:35,176
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for a roguelike co-op game that you play with 32 other people, that's why it's called 33 Immortals.

687
00:53:35,176 --> 00:53:35,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be interesting.

688
00:53:36,757 --> 00:53:47,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Palworld, a game that I'm still shocked exists, quite frankly, is out there and is getting a new update with new pals this summer.

689
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:54,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure they will all look legally distinct from other companies' small monsters in their series.

690
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:59,051
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there will also be four new pals in this and apparently a flamethrower weapon

691
00:53:59,491 --> 00:53:59,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Commando's Origin

692
00:54:19,187 --> 00:54:25,469
[SPEAKER_03]: An 8.8 bit point and click adventure game called Centum is coming out this summer.

693
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:32,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you like the old school sort of loom looking point and click games, this might be something up your alley.

694
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:33,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Loom is so good.

695
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:39,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's kind of that eight bit like it gives me that those LucasArts vibes from the style here.

696
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:43,354
[SPEAKER_03]: The game will shift between medieval and modern settings and it's out this summer.

697
00:54:44,937 --> 00:55:11,563
[SPEAKER_03]: uh let's see lost records bloom and rage which was announced at the 2023 game awards uh from don't nod which who made uh life is strange uh they are making this game now but no release date with this just a new trailer that came out uh key locker is coming out this summer on both pc and xbox uh similar to the plot of footloose uh this is a world where music is outlawed but you play as a singer great yeah

[SPEAKER_03]: Mario & Luigi RPG and Chrono Trigger both inspire Keylocker Stampede Racing Royale, a battle royale racing game, is coming out on Xbox as well

699
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:37,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackbox is making another party pack!

700
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:03,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But this time, they're leaning into something different.

701
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:06,525
[SPEAKER_03]: They are making the Jackbox Naughty Pack.

702
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:09,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is not a numbered entry.

703
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:12,846
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first Jackbox Naughty Pack.

704
00:56:12,846 --> 00:56:24,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what games are in it, but perhaps a- apparently the announcement trailer gives vibes of like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, one of those types of things.

705
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:32,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Jackbox Games making their own Naughty Pack, where now you are encouraged to have vibrator as every answer or whatever it is you want to do, so.

706
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:44,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Time's and Galaxy will be on PC and Xbox in June.

707
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:52,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Sulfur is a first-person shooter game, but I guess it has more old-school vibes to it with the art and everything.

708
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:55,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The Steam page describes it as a boomer shooter.

709

[SPEAKER_03]: Fera, The Sundered Tribes, Action RPG, Monster Hunting, Building Mechanics

712
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:55,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just new gameplay, but no release date or anything like that.

713
00:57:57,276 --> 00:58:00,017
[SPEAKER_03]: promise mascot agency.

716
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,941

[SPEAKER_03]: This is, of course, fusing Contra into Vampire Survivors.

722
00:58:56,845 --> 00:58:58,567
[SPEAKER_03]: May 9th is the big release date for that.

723
00:58:58,567 --> 00:58:59,287
[SPEAKER_03]: That's next week.

724
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:01,509
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty exciting.

725
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:06,833
[SPEAKER_03]: One other game, one last game, Dungeons of Hinterberg, a new trailer that has gameplay in it.

726
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:11,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a social sim and action RPG with cell shaded graphics.

727
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:12,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

728
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:18,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of stuff going on on the indie scene for Xbox and focusing on that this week.

729
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:19,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that was all the way back on Monday.

730
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:21,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of those titles kind of hit socials.

731
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:28,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Jackbox Naughty Pack was everywhere, but a few of those other games in there definitely sound like they're worth checking out as well.

732
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:31,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Game Pass gets a lot of those indie stuff.

733
00:59:31,156 --> 00:59:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you happen to have Game Pass, take a peek in there once in a while, because they're always adding some new things that may be worth your time to check out.

734
00:59:38,577 --> 00:59:41,658
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on to the PlayStation side of the house.

735
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:42,078
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

736
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:51,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So, have you ever wanted to just tell someone to play a game with you just by texting them?

737
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now Sony says you can do that with the PS5.

738
00:59:55,622 --> 01:00:01,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to invite someone into a game, even when they are not at their, you know,

739
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:03,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.

740
01:00:17,874 --> 01:00:19,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.

741
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:27,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you want to like is that person you meet on social media and you just message them and go, Hey, come play with me.

742
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:33,300
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, it's going to come out later this year only for PS5 games.

743
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, those subscriptions, they went up in price.

744
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:41,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So good luck.

745
01:00:41,382 --> 01:00:42,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They already fucked it up.

746
01:00:44,606 --> 01:00:51,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think it's interesting to have the more sort of, um, more ways of quickly jumping into someone's game.

747
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:56,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I think especially, you know, via text message and, you know, sliding into someone's DMs.

748
01:00:56,889 --> 01:01:05,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, although I don't use Twitter, I know that when I use Twitter, yeah, there'd probably be people on there that I'd be like, Hey, yeah, like a game just came out today.

749
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's party up together.

750
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:06,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

751
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:07,451
[SPEAKER_03]: You seem pretty cool.

752
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:09,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've been mutuals on Twitter for a while here.

753
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:10,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the link, jump in.

754
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:13,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that way you don't have to go, what's your game or tag or your,

755
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:18,737
[SPEAKER_03]: PSN name, whatever it is, I'll add you or you kind of skip a few steps with that.

756
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:19,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get it.

757
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:26,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, I don't use Twitter, but I can you think how many people would be inundated though?

758
01:01:26,486 --> 01:01:28,888
[SPEAKER_06]: How much use for abuse this could be?

759
01:01:28,888 --> 01:01:29,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.

760
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:29,889
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.

761
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:31,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, you'd want to

762
01:01:32,392 --> 01:01:35,354
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

763
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:54,067
[SPEAKER_03]: BlueSky is supposed to get DMs at some point.

764
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:54,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Instagram.

765
01:01:54,868 --> 01:01:57,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I do use Instagram and Instagram has DMs on it.

766
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:04,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and yeah, there's probably a couple people in there that if they DM me a link to join a PlayStation game, I'd be like, Sure, you know, you're you seem cool enough.

767
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:05,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

768
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:10,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So my like the PlayStation games going to be Hey, do you want to buy some art?

769
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:11,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to commission some art for me?

770
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:15,928
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's every day, like almost every day.

771
01:02:15,928 --> 01:02:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so many anonymous, like on Discord especially, I get so many anonymous friend requests.

772
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Pussy in bio?

773
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,051
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not that.

774
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:29,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's they see that I'm a content creator and they try to they try to sell me artwork.

775
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:35,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is all of the artwork that they're trying to sell is not actually artwork that they've made.

776
01:02:35,774 --> 01:02:38,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It's artwork made through generators online.

777
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:40,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it all looks the same.

778
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:40,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like,

779
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:41,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Discord

780
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:07,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?

781
01:03:07,264 --> 01:03:13,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's you know, I just shut off the fucking DMS on Twitter from people that I don't follow when I was on it.

782
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:19,214
[SPEAKER_06]: But I checked to see if somebody is on the server with me on discord.

783
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:23,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I've started doing is just being really passive aggressive about it.

784
01:03:23,578 --> 01:03:30,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Well, I'm so glad that you're like a real person and not just someone who only wants to be my friend to get me to commission work from them.

785
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:33,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one response.

786
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:36,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

787
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a response as well.

788
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,420
[SPEAKER_06]: That was rude.

789
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:47,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, now imagine how I feel when I have a degree in this shit and you're offering to do your AI generated work.

790
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:56,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's only going to get worse with, you know, machine learning, these algorithms where they learn how to talk to people in DMs and stuff.

791
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:57,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only going to get worse.

792
01:03:58,174 --> 01:04:03,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, I mean, it wouldn't be so bad if like, they just said, Hey, this is what I want to do.

793
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:07,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had one where they asked like, Oh, hey, I would like to draw some fan art.

794
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:08,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Okay, that's cool.

795
01:04:08,686 --> 01:04:10,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Yeah, but it's gonna cost you $50.

796
01:04:10,748 --> 01:04:13,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's not fan art.

797
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how that works.

798
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:15,073
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a commission.

799
01:04:15,073 --> 01:04:16,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you don't understand.

800
01:04:16,675 --> 01:04:18,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, no, no, I'm good.

801
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:21,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Fan art done by a fan.

802
01:04:40,425 --> 01:04:52,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm always like doing like whenever I go live, I do like one everyone when I go live and leave it at that.

803
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:57,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, I also go really try to promote a lot as much as I can.

804
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:00,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

805
01:05:00,826 --> 01:05:01,167
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

806
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:03,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I should be thankful I'm not getting these.

807
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:09,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really I used to get I do get bullshit on Instagram all the time collab, collab.

808
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,510
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to collab?

809
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we're interested in featuring you and have a collab sell product free product.

810
01:05:15,754 --> 01:05:16,354
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

811
01:05:16,354 --> 01:05:20,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it if the free product is cool enough, but it's going to be an honest review.

812
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:25,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's and it's never or it's it's it's free product, but it's oh, pay us for it.

813
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:27,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you get I don't know what the scam because I don't respond to them.

814
01:05:27,962 --> 01:05:33,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what specifically scam is, but I've read it's they say it's free, but you really pay them up front for it.

815
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:36,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

816
01:05:36,008 --> 01:05:37,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all like.

817
01:05:38,888 --> 01:05:47,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say this as a blanket statement to anyone who wants to have us pay you to do stuff.

818
01:05:47,661 --> 01:05:50,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I do all that shit myself.

819
01:05:50,304 --> 01:05:52,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do it for us for free.

820
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:56,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So no, the answer is no.

821
01:05:56,657 --> 01:06:00,980
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us free artwork, though, because you love us, I'll take it.

822
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

823
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll feature you.

824
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:05,003
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give you all kinds of props.

825
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,044
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's not AI art.

826
01:06:07,044 --> 01:06:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been some rad stuff from listeners over the years.

827
01:06:09,746 --> 01:06:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: There really has been.

828
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:15,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's usually like it's what I would call, quote unquote, verified listeners.

829
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:19,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's probably what Discord needs is some sort of verification system.

830
01:06:19,092 --> 01:06:22,334
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's a beast that's probably too big for me to tackle, but.

831
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:23,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Certified fan.

832
01:06:23,795 --> 01:06:36,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, like, oh, a name I've seen in chat for 15 weeks is now sending something that's like, yeah, okay, you're like a verified, like, I know you're not just coming out of the blue, like you're actually somebody that's participated with the show.

833
01:06:36,554 --> 01:06:37,355
[SPEAKER_03]: That's different, right?

834
01:06:38,220 --> 01:07:02,291
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah remember the guy that made a text based adventure game like way back in the early that was that was there's been also well then I think of like I think of YYR Bungie ferret tossing kind of as a fan game and sorts I mean obviously he made it his own but uh you know it's very flattering so yeah all right anyhow let's move on just a couple more stories and then we'll get to the classic game of the week but first Loki

835
01:07:03,868 --> 01:07:23,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so as referenced in our intro, people have been exploiting the OpenStreetMaps to place beaches where beaches aren't because, you know, they want Pokemon that appear on beaches to be those fake beaches.

836
01:07:23,002 --> 01:07:30,448
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings me back to Ingress and early Pokemon Go days where people would have like, you know, significant

837
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:36,094
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, your your mailbox as a significant point, you know, of interest and stuff like that.

838
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:42,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still it's still those fucking little free free libraries, which as a concept I do like.

839
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:48,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think little free libraries are cute things for neighborhoods and stuff, but they they do not all need to be pokey stops.

840
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:56,503
[SPEAKER_03]: They are only appropriate as a pokey stop in a public park or public setting of some sort that's not a school like.

841
01:07:56,503 --> 01:07:57,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that.

842
01:07:57,944 --> 01:08:01,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's still there's still too many of those damn libraries.

843
01:08:01,668 --> 01:08:02,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for Wiglet.

844
01:08:02,629 --> 01:08:04,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just let Wiglet go.

845
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:04,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

846
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:10,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but anyways, yeah, so they're manipulating any real world data to add more beaches.

847
01:08:10,957 --> 01:08:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they figured out that these Pokemon spawn at beaches.

848
01:08:15,942 --> 01:08:20,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's essentially what they've been doing before with like, you know, saying, Oh, hey, this is a park.

849
01:08:20,127 --> 01:08:22,029
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's, you know, this is a beach.

850
01:08:23,163 --> 01:08:25,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my kids are being extremely loud behind me.

851
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:27,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all I hear is like a table moving or something.

852
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:28,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

853
01:08:28,328 --> 01:08:32,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It they're just it's it's and I don't think I said it on air yet.

854
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:34,353
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do have a new microphone tonight.

855
01:08:34,353 --> 01:08:38,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Loki's voice sounds a little different than it used to, it's because he has a new mic.

856
01:08:38,036 --> 01:08:42,339
[SPEAKER_02]: But but I have an XLR mic now and a mixer and it's it's fancy.

857
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:43,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also to me.

858
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:43,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

859
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:45,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably pick some more stuff in the background.

860
01:08:45,883 --> 01:08:48,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is very sensitive.

861
01:08:48,085 --> 01:08:48,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

862
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:48,746
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

863
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:50,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, back to editing the map.

864
01:08:50,288 --> 01:09:05,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this was people were exploiting the OpenStreetMap once they found out, you know, the correlation got figured out that that that Niantic was using OpenStreetMaps to basically feed all the data, people would create parks because nests, nests

865
01:09:06,606 --> 01:09:09,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon nests at parks used to be a much bigger deal.

866
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:20,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still technically a game mechanic, but I feel like people really care way less about it because most of the Pokemon that tend to be in this nest are not really special Pokemon.

867
01:09:20,297 --> 01:09:21,779
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of commonplace.

868
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:24,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like people kind of care less about that.

869
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:29,025
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember in the earlier days of Pokemon Go, it was a big fucking deal to be able to have a nest nearby at your park.

870
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:30,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Dratini, Dratini, Dratini

871
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:53,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were like having security like try to throw people out and stuff like that.

872
01:09:53,051 --> 01:09:55,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know them HOA Karens got furious.

873
01:09:55,812 --> 01:09:58,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Those HOA Karens got furious.

874
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:08,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure they were chatting on Facebook and their HOA Karen groups to talk about how these people would drive by in their car slowly by my house because they're thinking about robbing me.

875
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:10,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, they're just playing Pokemon Go.

876
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,541
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, you shouldn't drive and play Pokemon Go.

877
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:12,761
[SPEAKER_03]: But

878
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

879
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:32,706
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

880
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:55,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, the beach thing is interesting because of this particular new Pokemon wiglet that will only spawn at beaches.

881
01:10:55,533 --> 01:11:03,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people are creating beaches in their backyard by their pool, and these other sorts of silly things.

882
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the gag.

883
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:07,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Go only imports that

884
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:13,423
[SPEAKER_03]: OpenStreetMap data like once every six months, it's very rare they actually update the data.

885
01:11:13,423 --> 01:11:16,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they update the data, they're usually using old data.

886
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:20,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're trying to add these beaches, it's not going to it's going to take like nine months.

887
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:25,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And by then there will have been like a wiglet spotlight hour or something, there'll probably be another way to get these things.

888
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:33,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there'll be a special event that cause oh, it's come on down to the summer event and Pokemon Go where Pokemon normally found at beaches will spawn everywhere.

889
01:11:35,367 --> 01:11:39,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sort of like when you had your country specific ones.

890
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:41,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they still got that.

891
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:41,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

892
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:53,880
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, but yeah, like Heracross, as an example, used to be one that you could only get within, I think, between the two, like Tropic of Capricorn and Tropic of Cancer.

893
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I think Heracross only spawned in between those two.

894
01:11:57,542 --> 01:12:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that was, you know, I don't want to say the equator because it was a much bigger line than that, but basically, you know, a big thick line around the center of the earth.

895
01:12:05,548 --> 01:12:06,568
[SPEAKER_03]: is where Heracross was won.

896
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:15,835
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've had these events now, where like, because Mega Evolution Heracross was in raids, you could just go raid a Heracross down the street and get them now.

897
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:19,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, eventually, even the regionals seem to show up.

898
01:12:19,578 --> 01:12:19,758
[SPEAKER_03]: But

899
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:22,130
[SPEAKER_03]: People like to have them first.

900
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,711
[SPEAKER_03]: People like to show off their little digital trophies.

901
01:12:24,711 --> 01:12:25,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

902
01:12:25,852 --> 01:12:27,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I have found one.

903
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:29,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually went in because I was curious.

904
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, well, what are the beach spots around here?

905
01:12:30,715 --> 01:12:37,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was also like, that probably drives the Pikmin beach data too, because I could use some more of those.

906
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:42,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's like one spot here in Sacramento.

907
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's one in somebody's backyard.

908
01:12:43,862 --> 01:12:45,903
[SPEAKER_06]: What about spots at Folsom Lake?

909
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:49,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see, I didn't look that far east.

910
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't look that far east to look at Folsom Lake.

911
01:12:51,861 --> 01:12:55,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to look like what I was assuming maybe the rivers would have stuff.

912
01:12:55,842 --> 01:12:57,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Lake Dantoma has a beach.

913
01:12:57,522 --> 01:13:00,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be wouldn't be surprised if there was a beach there.

914
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:08,685
[SPEAKER_03]: The only one I found near downtown was Discovery Park, which technically does have a beach Discovery Park where they do aftershock and all that.

915
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:14,707
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the west side, there's like a beach there a little little beach, but it's there and that is actually in Pokemon Go.

916
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So

917
01:13:15,879 --> 01:13:19,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a beach isn't a kiddie pool with a sandbox next to it.

918
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:19,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

919
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:23,023
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, this is, yeah, this is legit, like, river, river beach.

920
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah, that, that, that'll be the place.

921
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:31,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the other way I figured out that it's legit, because Niantic's Campfire.

922
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that that's a thing?

923
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:38,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Niantic put out their own social media app that they're grossly underutilizing, but whatever, because it's, it's kind of,

924
01:13:39,793 --> 01:13:47,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it tries to be Discord but it's like Discord but clunky and with no features.

925
01:13:47,922 --> 01:13:59,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have Campfire and you can post pictures of things you found on Campfire which are GPS stamped and so people are really silly and posting things they catch at their house all the time which is a terrible idea but

926
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:05,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I also looked at that beach in Campfire and somebody posted the wiglet they found there.

927
01:14:05,799 --> 01:14:14,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is an interesting way to sort of confirm, oh, this is where people are finding things because people post random shit to Campfire with the Pokemon creatures.

928
01:14:14,243 --> 01:14:17,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is working then if it's not updated every six months.

929
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:19,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it is updating a little bit faster.

930
01:14:20,026 --> 01:14:24,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming because Discovery Park is legitimately a beach over there.

931
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:26,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's small as hell, but it's legitimately beach.

932
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:30,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably was just in the data years ago because it is it should be a beach.

933
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:31,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's legitimate.

934
01:14:31,152 --> 01:14:31,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

935
01:14:31,912 --> 01:14:39,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that seems to be the one place now the person's backyard in the middle of Rancho Cordova or wherever I saw that.

936
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:42,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's actually a spawning beach, but, you know, I think

937
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:58,011
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's like having the pokestop in front of your house at first it sounds like a good idea but then when that becomes a gym you're gonna have random trucks running their engine at 3am out front of your house to take the gym back like it's don't do it anyway

938
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:06,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on because I find this one very interesting and people are reading a lot into this off of very little, but let's talk about what it is.

939
01:15:06,884 --> 01:15:08,425
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually shared in our Discord.

940
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:12,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might have been in Bobby's channel, but too bad I stole it because we do that.

941
01:15:12,067 --> 01:15:13,007
[SPEAKER_03]: He does it to us too.

942
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:14,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So we steal from each other.

943
01:15:14,608 --> 01:15:16,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Stories posted over on our Discord server.

944
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:20,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You should visit our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

945
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:21,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

946
01:15:21,972 --> 01:15:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently there has been a very interesting rating by the ESRB for Nintendo Switch.

947
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:34,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game called Nintendo World Championships NES Edition, and it's been given an E rating by the ESRB.

948
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:41,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the description it says, this is a collection of 2D challenges and platformer games in which players traverse through various modes.

949
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:44,303
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, speedrun, survival.

950
01:15:44,303 --> 01:15:50,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Several challenges involve reaching specific points, while others prompt players to defeat small enemies or survive brief battles.

951
01:15:51,306 --> 01:15:57,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Some games depict pixelated characters using small swords or arrows to strike at enemies.

952
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Enemies typically get stunned or disappear in a flash.

953
01:16:21,806 --> 01:16:30,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see how you get to that conclusion when part of this says, pixelated characters using small swords or arrows.

954
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:32,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Rad Racer, no arrows.

955
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:35,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Brothers, or Super Mario Brothers, no arrows.

956
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Tetris, no arrows.

957
01:16:37,076 --> 01:16:40,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think it's the 1990 cart.

958
01:16:40,658 --> 01:16:42,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I think is happening here.

959
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:48,247
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get a Switch 2 this year, then cool.

960
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:49,687
[SPEAKER_03]: This could still be a thing this year.

961
01:16:49,687 --> 01:17:00,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember when I was talking about how if Switch 2 isn't happening until next year, they're going to need to come up with these cutesy little ideas to try to hold us over.

962
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:02,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep selling the Nintendo Online subs.

963
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Do these things that could be low effort, high reward, sort of Nintendo leaning on their IPs.

964
01:17:08,593 --> 01:17:12,657
[SPEAKER_03]: to kind of create these things that would, you know, cause interest in the Switch.

965
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:27,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, imagine a game using the branding and the IP of Nintendo World Championships that gets announced in June at a Direct, but maybe it's a Nintendo World Championships with new games from Switch Online.

966
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:32,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm giving Nintendo a lot of credit here, but imagine

967
01:17:34,212 --> 01:17:41,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's several different challenges that, dare I say, rotate weekly or monthly that you could do.

968
01:17:41,717 --> 01:17:50,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, people are making the comparison to NES Remix, which is great, but I don't even necessarily know they have to go so far as to, like, remix and do things to the game.

969
01:17:50,442 --> 01:17:56,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe if they just take that same idea of having the little portions of the game.

970
01:17:56,066 --> 01:18:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, yeah, RecordWN in chat says, this is the lowest, lowest effort possible.

971
01:18:01,269 --> 01:18:06,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and we would still be applauding Nintendo for taking it because it's like, congrats, you tried.

972
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there would be a lot of people that would be into this.

973
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:14,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do the, was it WarioWare, but like, you know, Nintendo game clips.

974
01:18:14,401 --> 01:18:16,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even necessarily think it has to be that.

975
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:21,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just take the concept of Nintendo World Championships, but apply it to new games.

976
01:18:21,983 --> 01:18:25,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat stage one, and I'm literally going to pull games out of my ass.

977
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:29,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat stage one of RC Pro-Am.

978
01:18:29,784 --> 01:18:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat the first level of Wario's Woods.

979
01:18:33,185 --> 01:18:36,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And then collect as many rupees in Zelda as you can before time runs out.

980
01:18:37,932 --> 01:18:41,341
[SPEAKER_03]: There, I just made what could be the challenge for the first week.

981
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:44,209
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and I know this requires Nintendo to be online,

982
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:51,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to just, we're going to form our prayer circles and we're going to light our candles and make our wishes and summon the devil.

983
01:18:51,864 --> 01:18:56,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at our sundials and see if, you know, it's been like 20 years since online has happened.

984
01:18:56,025 --> 01:19:02,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Nintendo will have online leaderboards for this, where you can compete against your friends.

985
01:19:02,627 --> 01:19:11,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might be a fun thing for streamers to play, you know, going for the challenge, you know, especially if they rotated it every week or something like that.

986
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:14,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that could be how you'd have- You'll tie into your prodigy accounts?

987
01:19:14,611 --> 01:19:18,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo World Championships, but like modern.

988
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love it for me to go a step further and like actually do the NES remix thing and like the cartridges are doing different things.

989
01:19:25,246 --> 01:19:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Wrecker WN said earlier, I'm giving you the lowest effort possible idea that could still be pretty cool.

990
01:19:32,132 --> 01:19:34,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, you're all very kind in chat.

991
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:36,934
[SPEAKER_03]: SGO100Math says Rob Stradamus is going to strike on this.

992
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:39,235
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkJosiah says, now I really hope Rob is right on this one.

993
01:19:39,235 --> 01:19:39,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Hire Rob.

994
01:19:39,736 --> 01:19:44,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you all are very sweet, and my ego is very large, and my feed in Nintendo would be very cheap.

995
01:19:44,498 --> 01:19:46,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And RecordWN simply states, it won't be this cool.

996
01:19:48,450 --> 01:20:11,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I you're right but I wish I wish you weren't like again like we just said this this doesn't seem like it would be a huge effort right like use the ROMs you already have to do anyway that would be a good Nintendo World Championship or you know Congrats you put in the minimum effort Nintendo World Championship

997
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:21,086
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wonder if it isn't something that they're sitting on for a June Nintendo Direct reveal that will be a, it's out today type of thing.

998
01:20:21,086 --> 01:20:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be the thing to do.

999
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:26,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that DarkSakura, thank you.

1000
01:20:26,411 --> 01:20:29,474
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTosia says, I'm sure Rob's in the ballpark at least.

1001
01:20:29,474 --> 01:20:30,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope so.

1002
01:20:30,174 --> 01:20:30,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to be there.

1003
01:20:30,855 --> 01:20:36,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even worse, it's just something that they have at their event and it's not actually a game you get to play.

1004
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck off.

1005
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: but you're you might be right like you really might but like honestly fuck off but it's the swords and arrows what there there were no games in the 90s cartridge that had arrows I'm not even trying to think I'm even trying to think of this because wasn't there another one did they do another championship cart after that

1006
01:20:56,923 --> 01:20:59,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a Super Nintendo one, or am I making that up?

1007
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,666
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, I think, a second one.

1008
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:02,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a hallucination.

1009
01:21:02,228 --> 01:21:03,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1010
01:21:03,088 --> 01:21:06,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I doing that whole, like, making up the movie with Shaquille O'Neal?

1011
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:07,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who was it?

1012
01:21:07,032 --> 01:21:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was Sinbad.

1013
01:21:07,953 --> 01:21:11,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Making up the movie with Sinbad that doesn't exist, but, like, I swear to God I saw a trailer for it.

1014
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:14,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm doing that with the Nintendo World Championships.

1015
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:16,180
[SPEAKER_06]: What's in that tea you're drinking?

1016
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it look like bits of mushroom?

1017
01:21:17,761 --> 01:21:18,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1018
01:21:18,482 --> 01:21:19,083
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1019
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:19,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1020
01:21:19,803 --> 01:21:21,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like the Sinbad Genie movie?

1021
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:22,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that.

1022
01:21:22,325 --> 01:21:22,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that.

1023
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:31,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, and I have like a mental image of having seen something that it was likely a mock-up.

1024
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:32,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1025
01:21:32,331 --> 01:21:33,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.

1026
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:33,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1027
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:34,372
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1028
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:38,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's take a time and travel back to something that isn't a hallucination.

1029
01:21:38,635 --> 01:21:45,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it was because it never actually happened because once a month, DarkSakura turns this segment on its head and says, you know what?

1030
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:51,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of doing a classic game in a month, I'm going to do a classic game you never got to play because it was canceled.

1031
01:21:51,663 --> 01:21:52,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1032
01:21:52,563 --> 01:21:53,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to this.

1033
01:21:53,023 --> 01:21:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucks to be us.

1034
01:22:04,577 --> 01:22:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1035
01:22:12,347 --> 01:22:16,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1036
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:18,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, this one.

1037
01:22:19,798 --> 01:22:24,220
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, this one is going to piss a lot of people off this week.

1038
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stab in the feels.

1039
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:26,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1040
01:22:26,102 --> 01:22:32,825
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to make a lot of people very angry remembering that this game was canceled, but it is absolutely... But you know what it was canceled for.

1041
01:22:32,825 --> 01:22:37,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is absolutely a worthy addition to this segment.

1042
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:39,109
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the game, DarkSakura?

1043
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:41,630
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is Scalebound.

1044
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Ow.

1045
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:43,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1046
01:22:44,102 --> 01:22:54,951
[SPEAKER_06]: An action role-playing game developed by Platinum Games in work from 2013 until it was cancelled in 2017.

1047
01:22:54,951 --> 01:23:03,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be released in 2017 for Windows and Xbox One, but it was announced as cancelled in January 2017 by Microsoft.

1048
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:16,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the game would be in a third-person perspective where you play the main character, Drew, going through the world of Draconis.

1049
01:23:16,945 --> 01:23:29,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a dragon named Fubon, who would be your bestie, and you're bonded, and so if one of you died, the other would die as well.

1050
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:38,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Your dragon was controlled by AI, but you could give commands to the dragon during attacks.

1051
01:23:38,396 --> 01:23:44,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You could also enter dragon link mode that let you directly control the dragon from the dragon's perspective.

1052
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:50,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it would shift to first person and it makes Drew vulnerable to attacks.

1053
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:57,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have three kinds of dragons with different abilities.

1054
01:23:57,008 --> 01:24:01,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can be blended together with customization.

1055
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:09,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can basically just make your custom dragon from any combination of these different elements.

1056
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:14,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can eventually ride the dragon, though not at the start.

1057
01:24:15,396 --> 01:24:19,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's special elemental attacks they have in their berserker mode.

1058
01:24:19,817 --> 01:24:24,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could upgrade the abilities with gems that you pick up from enemies.

1059
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:30,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's also different melee weapons.

1060
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:41,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes it's saying that the weapons will become degraded and lose their durability, very like what was going on in the more recent Zelda games.

1061
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:52,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course you have large enemies that you can climb onto and smack around, and the main character has a dragon arm.

1062
01:24:53,286 --> 01:25:13,836
[SPEAKER_06]: that can get information or do pulse energy or heal the dragon and then you can also shapeshift into a half dragon and you have skill points to level up and all kinds of just stuff and a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode and just all kinds of fun.

1063
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:31,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like I said, it was in development by Platinum Games, and the concept was actually created when Platinum was established in 2006, but then they went with Bayonetta instead of Scalebound.

1064
01:25:31,244 --> 01:25:34,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they tried again after Bayonetta,

1065
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:40,181
[SPEAKER_06]: and they had a prototype, but everyone was like, eh, so they did the wonderful 101.

1066
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:48,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Then after that, they revised the idea and got the okay to start development in 2013.

1067
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:57,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Kamiya Hideki, he was really excited about this, but it was something that they had never worked on before.

1068
01:25:57,995 --> 01:26:03,079
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to create a game that would be like no other game that Platinum did,

1069
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: something that ended up being a real big challenge for the studio.

1070
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:13,118
[SPEAKER_06]: He also called it a collaboration between Platinum and Microsoft.

1071
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:23,048
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to have action in the game, but not as the core of the game, but that the combat will be at high quality.

1072
01:26:24,037 --> 01:26:42,902
[SPEAKER_06]: and that they were putting more of an emphasis on graphics and visual quality to make it as photorealistic as possible and to be more accessible to new players that, you know, they could reach more people with this fantasy, you know, environment.

1073
01:26:42,902 --> 01:26:50,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, they also worked with Microsoft's user research labs to be sure that it would be to a lot of people's taste.

1074
01:26:52,565 --> 01:26:59,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the first action roleplay game developed by Platinum and a dream come true for Kamiya.

1075
01:26:59,049 --> 01:27:04,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I always wanted to have a dragon companion.

1076
01:27:04,073 --> 01:27:07,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, this is me saying, what about Panzer Dragoon?

1077
01:27:07,775 --> 01:27:09,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1078
01:27:09,276 --> 01:27:10,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Panzer Dragoon?

1079
01:27:10,377 --> 01:27:11,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?

1080
01:27:11,618 --> 01:27:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, the idea, though, for the bond between the protagonist and the dragon was not originally planned.

1081
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:38,902
[SPEAKER_06]: But they wanted to increase the player participation in the game, and so they had the story be Drew's and the gameplay on Thuban, but the two together were the main story.

1082
01:27:38,902 --> 01:27:41,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And also it was going to be a dinosaur game at some point.

1083
01:27:42,814 --> 01:27:45,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nihoo.

1084
01:27:45,275 --> 01:27:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the inspirations for this was Sorcerian, which was off the Dragon Slayer.

1085
01:27:55,858 --> 01:28:07,622
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a game on the PC, 8801MA, Hydlide 3, which we got some of those other games in the series here in the US.

1086
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:10,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some of the dragons out of Dragon Quest.

1087
01:28:12,163 --> 01:28:23,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there was this pulse energy in the game, and that was directly inspired by the Force from Star Wars, hence why I picked this game.

1088
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would be non-linear.

1089
01:28:28,707 --> 01:28:33,350
[SPEAKER_06]: They had really put a lot of work into the world.

1090
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:36,472
[SPEAKER_06]: 80% of it was based off of Earth's landscape.

1091
01:28:36,472 --> 01:28:42,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's 20% that were environments that the pulse energy had shaped.

1092
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:46,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was just so much work into this.

1093
01:28:51,548 --> 01:28:55,152
[SPEAKER_06]: The game, however, it missed E3 2015.

1094
01:28:55,152 --> 01:29:02,999
[SPEAKER_06]: They did show gameplay at Gamescom 2015 with Crackdown 3 and Quantum Break.

1095
01:29:02,999 --> 01:29:11,327
[SPEAKER_06]: They announced the cooperative four-player multiplayer mode, and they had the release set for 2016.

1096
01:29:11,327 --> 01:29:14,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It was delayed to 2017, and then it was canceled January 2017.

1097
01:29:18,044 --> 01:29:35,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The head of Platinum, Inaba Atsushi, said that it wasn't easy to see Microsoft getting criticisms because he felt both sides failed and that the game, quote, didn't do all the things we needed to do as a developer.

1098
01:29:35,095 --> 01:29:44,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So they still, Microsoft still owns Scalebound, but Platinum would love to return to keep working on it if Microsoft would let them.

1099
01:29:45,641 --> 01:30:01,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last thing is that in an interview with Cutscenes, Kamiya apologized for the game's cancellation and that the development team wasn't experienced enough in creating an online featured game.

1100
01:30:01,169 --> 01:30:07,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are some concepts, though, from Scalebound that showed up in Bayonetta 3.

1101
01:30:07,593 --> 01:30:09,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.

1102
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:09,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1103
01:30:11,243 --> 01:30:15,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because this game, you know, looking at the alpha footage that you know, is playing while we're talking about the game.

1104
01:30:15,886 --> 01:30:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks neat.

1105
01:30:17,006 --> 01:30:21,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just like, yeah, but I get maybe it just really ran poorly online.

1106
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:25,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, there's probably parts of the game that weren't optimized well, because they didn't have the experience with it.

1107
01:30:25,311 --> 01:30:26,412
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a bummer.

1108
01:30:26,412 --> 01:30:28,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't make it come together.

1109
01:30:28,073 --> 01:30:30,194
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it looked fun.

1110
01:30:30,194 --> 01:30:32,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But I yeah, don't don't release a game if it sucks.

1111
01:30:32,855 --> 01:30:33,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1112
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:35,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So they came to that conclusion.

1113
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't as fun as it looked.

1114
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:37,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

1115
01:30:37,881 --> 01:30:49,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, I can see where it draws influence from some of those, some other games, but I honestly think, though, that this concept might have influenced games that came after it was cancelled.

1116
01:30:49,508 --> 01:31:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, not just, like, the bits that showed up in Bayonetta, but, I mean, I see some elements that could go with the later Panzer Dragoon games.

1117
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:03,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, uh,

1118
01:31:04,773 --> 01:31:15,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh gosh, there's another game I can't think of off the top of my head, but where you, you know, you have, uh, other assistant, you know, characters work with you.

1119
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:17,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like it's really neat.

1120
01:31:17,745 --> 01:31:20,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I get big Xenoblade vibes for some reason, but yeah.

1121
01:31:20,348 --> 01:31:24,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, some, but I want a dragon.

1122
01:31:24,211 --> 01:31:25,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't?

1123
01:31:25,573 --> 01:31:25,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1124
01:31:25,933 --> 01:31:29,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Fantasy Star and the dragon is his mag.

1125
01:31:29,256 --> 01:31:29,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1126
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:37,852
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, there it is, a game you're never going to play, Scalebound, your classic canceled game of the month.

1127
01:31:37,852 --> 01:31:39,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, not sorry, because it's not my fault.

1128
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:40,572
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not your fault.

1129
01:31:40,572 --> 01:31:41,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just telling y'all about it.

1130
01:31:41,693 --> 01:31:44,594
[SPEAKER_06]: You should know about this and then write Microsoft.

1131
01:31:44,594 --> 01:31:46,974
[SPEAKER_03]: How terrible it was that this is gone.

1132
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:47,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Open letter.

1133
01:31:47,814 --> 01:31:49,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We won this game.

1134
01:31:49,015 --> 01:31:52,476
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always these random rumors that pop up that the game's getting revived.

1135
01:31:52,476 --> 01:32:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of it's wishful thinking, but wouldn't that be a gag if somebody took this concept, like just a different studio, took this concept and made a new game?

1136
01:32:01,877 --> 01:32:02,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

1137
01:32:02,778 --> 01:32:03,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

1138
01:32:03,838 --> 01:32:06,120
[SPEAKER_06]: New Orange Lounge campaign.

1139
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Scalebound.

1140
01:32:07,521 --> 01:32:10,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it so.

1141
01:32:10,183 --> 01:32:11,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we'd be alone on that one.

1142
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of you.

1143
01:32:12,244 --> 01:32:21,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously I want the game to be good, but, you know, I'm kind of reminded of, in a way, I'm reminded of Final Fantasy XV.

1144
01:32:23,152 --> 01:32:30,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I say that is because, of course, XV started as Final Fantasy XIII Versus and had a completely different director in the beginning.

1145
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:39,906
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was in development for ten years, but we all know, no, the real game was in development for like three years because they pulled the plug on whatever they were developing before.

1146
01:32:39,906 --> 01:32:46,311
[SPEAKER_03]: And because the product that ended up coming out, if you go back and look at that very first announcement trailer for Final Fantasy Versus XIII,

1147
01:32:47,572 --> 01:33:11,256
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's like the characters are the same and there's parts of it that look familiar in the settings but like the actual gameplay is like what the fuck is this you know it's different so it'd be interesting if you know the concept of Scalebound came back as like a new type of title but I think I have I have an idea for a new name for it what hey bitches I got a dragon fuck off I'd play that wouldn't you

1148
01:33:12,455 --> 01:33:20,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I keep thinking of the movie How to Train Your Dragon, but maybe it's like how to train your dragon dot dot dot to kill your enemies or something.

1149
01:33:20,758 --> 01:33:21,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1150
01:33:21,818 --> 01:33:22,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1151
01:33:22,459 --> 01:33:23,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, TikTok.

1152
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:24,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Unalive.

1153
01:33:24,059 --> 01:33:26,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Unalive your enemies.

1154
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, people?

1155
01:33:29,621 --> 01:33:32,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not mincing any words.

1156
01:33:32,262 --> 01:33:33,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1157
01:33:33,543 --> 01:33:34,123
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1158
01:33:34,123 --> 01:33:35,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just not going to say it right now.

1159
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:36,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I'm not blinking.

1160
01:33:37,372 --> 01:33:45,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on and travel around the news sphere quickly with some rapid fire news.

1161
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other quick headlines for us.

1162
01:33:47,181 --> 01:33:47,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1163
01:33:48,803 --> 01:33:53,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we have news that the Xbox Gaming Showcase is going to be on June 9th at 10 a.m.

1164
01:33:53,906 --> 01:33:55,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific Time.

1165
01:33:55,406 --> 01:34:08,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to show off a bunch of different games that are coming for Xbox, including New Gears of War and, you know, Microsoft Flight Simulator Avowed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

1166
01:34:08,113 --> 01:34:16,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's supposed to be also a Call of Duty director showcase or whatever they want to call it right afterwards.

1167
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:16,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1168
01:34:17,688 --> 01:34:20,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1169
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:31,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I don't know why this is a thing, but apparently 7-Eleven and Tetris are collabing right now.

1170
01:34:31,754 --> 01:34:33,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should they, really?

1171
01:34:33,855 --> 01:34:37,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get t-shirts and merch.

1172
01:34:37,217 --> 01:34:40,098
[SPEAKER_06]: They did 7-Eleven exclusive Funko Deadpool pops.

1173
01:34:41,573 --> 01:34:46,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can now get a Slurpee cup that you can play Tetris on.

1174
01:34:46,596 --> 01:34:50,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be fair, it's not really a Slurpee cup because you can't put Slurpee in it.

1175
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:55,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just a fake Slurpee cup that lights up, but it has Tetris on the side of it.

1176
01:34:55,921 --> 01:34:57,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 30 bucks and it's available.

1177
01:34:57,662 --> 01:35:01,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of don't need that.

1178
01:35:01,104 --> 01:35:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be more curious than like what you can hack this thing to do, but.

1179
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:07,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you can put Doom on it.

1180
01:35:07,508 --> 01:35:08,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably could.

1181
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Linux!

1182
01:35:09,569 --> 01:35:10,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably could.

1183
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:10,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably could.

1184
01:35:11,502 --> 01:35:15,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny enough, on my way home from ballet, I do pass a 7-Eleven.

1185
01:35:15,383 --> 01:35:16,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I should look.

1186
01:35:16,903 --> 01:35:19,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is available through their website, just to be clear.

1187
01:35:19,524 --> 01:35:22,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they actually sell this in store.

1188
01:35:22,545 --> 01:35:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, if I do see this in store, I will be picking this up.

1189
01:35:25,005 --> 01:35:25,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm laughing.

1190
01:35:25,866 --> 01:35:30,607
[SPEAKER_03]: FifthDream's tinfoil hat theory here in chat over at Twitch.tv, social VOG Network.

1191
01:35:30,607 --> 01:35:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: FifthDream says, 11 minus 7 equals 4.

1192
01:35:33,908 --> 01:35:34,908
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 equals Tetris.

1193
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:35,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I solved it.

1194
01:35:37,389 --> 01:35:42,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll get an exclusive version of Tetris called Slurptris.

1195
01:35:42,371 --> 01:35:44,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it have the kill screen?

1196
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:54,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have all the different Slurpees and maybe different 7-Eleven gas station items that you can line up.

1197
01:35:54,534 --> 01:35:54,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1198
01:35:54,794 --> 01:35:57,055
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can have Hatchris, we can have anything.

1199
01:35:57,055 --> 01:35:59,296
[SPEAKER_03]: RecordWN in chat calls it a boomer shooter cup.

1200
01:36:01,095 --> 01:36:03,656
[SPEAKER_03]: If we put Doom on it, it'll be a Boomer Shooter Cup.

1201
01:36:03,656 --> 01:36:05,517
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1202
01:36:05,517 --> 01:36:06,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

1203
01:36:06,157 --> 01:36:06,997
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1204
01:36:06,997 --> 01:36:08,177
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1205
01:36:08,177 --> 01:36:08,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff.

1206
01:36:08,838 --> 01:36:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1207
01:36:09,358 --> 01:36:10,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1208
01:36:10,058 --> 01:36:11,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you have then for us, DarkSakura?

1209
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You can change the topic.

1210
01:36:12,699 --> 01:36:15,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Something cooler, you know?

1211
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,381
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Rest and Saga?

1212
01:36:19,702 --> 01:36:21,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Reston Saga is coming to Switch on May 2nd.

1213
01:36:36,409 --> 01:36:44,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and you can get it, uh, for the Arcade Archives by Hamster.

1214
01:36:44,175 --> 01:36:57,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And the original game was released by Taito in 1987, where you play Raston the Thief, who looks a lot more like Conan the Barbarian and who has to beat up a dragon.

1215
01:36:57,865 --> 01:37:00,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Legally distinct Conan the Barbarian.

1216
01:37:00,467 --> 01:37:01,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1217
01:37:01,928 --> 01:37:02,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Conan the Pal.

1218
01:37:05,773 --> 01:37:10,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rastan the Berserker, there we go.

1219
01:37:10,855 --> 01:37:12,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, he's a thief.

1220
01:37:12,216 --> 01:37:25,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But there you go, and it also has high score leaderboards and different difficulties, and you can reproduce the arcade settings and all kinds of stuff.

1221
01:37:25,961 --> 01:37:27,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

1222
01:37:29,605 --> 01:37:33,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about some games coming to PlayStation Plus.

1223
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:38,216
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are a PlayStation Plus person, then you know you get some free monthly games.

1224
01:37:38,216 --> 01:37:41,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And the monthly games that will be going up on May 7 have been announced.

1225
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,985
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also your reminder to grab the current library of games from April.

1226
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:48,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Destiny 2 Lightfall PlayStation 5 PlayStation 4 EA Sports FC 24 Standard Edition

1227
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:17,722
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Plus, Ghostrunner 2 on the PlayStation 5.

1228
01:38:17,722 --> 01:38:25,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Mike Deft endorsed game Tunic also will be given away for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

1229
01:38:25,485 --> 01:38:31,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So you are literally like now I think that game has been given away on Xbox or at least with Game Pass.

1230
01:38:31,087 --> 01:38:33,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's been given away as part of this.

1231
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:35,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've given it away on Nintendo's platform.

1232
01:38:35,768 --> 01:38:41,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mike Deft would like to let you know you literally have no reason at this point to not try Tunic.

1233
01:38:43,156 --> 01:38:44,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did, I did play Tunic.

1234
01:38:44,177 --> 01:38:45,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I should finish Tunic, really, but I played it.

1235
01:38:45,918 --> 01:38:46,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cute.

1236
01:38:46,459 --> 01:38:47,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1237
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a neat little spin on a familiar formula.

1238
01:38:50,802 --> 01:38:52,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So I liked it.

1239
01:38:52,663 --> 01:38:53,964
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1240
01:38:53,964 --> 01:39:02,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you can buy this week because they're probably not going to be free this week, but you can buy them because they're coming out.

1241
01:39:02,590 --> 01:39:04,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what do you have for the US?

1242
01:39:04,912 --> 01:39:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Indica on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1243
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:25,817
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rising on PC, Animal Well on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5, Gift on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Crow Country on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1244
01:39:25,817 --> 01:39:28,579
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't stop here.

1245
01:39:28,579 --> 01:39:30,019
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Crow Country.

1246
01:39:30,019 --> 01:39:31,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1247
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Kitty, Big City on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1248
01:39:38,527 --> 01:39:48,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle Chomp Champs on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1249
01:39:48,073 --> 01:39:52,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Namco could have shortened that name a lot.

1250
01:39:52,215 --> 01:40:00,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, last but not least, a familiar one, Rainbow Cotton on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One.

1251
01:40:02,323 --> 01:40:05,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you came over and played that game with me.

1252
01:40:05,964 --> 01:40:08,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you did when I had it on Dreamcast.

1253
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a long time ago, but yeah.

1254
01:40:10,066 --> 01:40:15,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I had had my DDR second around that time.

1255
01:40:15,888 --> 01:40:20,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost positive when we did the show at your house some time ago, that definitely happened.

1256
01:40:21,789 --> 01:40:23,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that game is trippy.

1257
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:52,970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

1258
01:41:18,735 --> 01:41:19,776
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some stuff.

1259
01:41:19,776 --> 01:41:20,236
[SPEAKER_06]: No one cares.

1260
01:41:20,236 --> 01:41:21,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

1261
01:41:21,437 --> 01:41:28,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We have on the 10th for Switch, we have Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin.

1262
01:41:28,741 --> 01:41:33,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Also PlayStation and Xbox Construction Simulator Gold Edition.

1263
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:37,967
[SPEAKER_06]: For computers, we have Homeworld 3 Collector's Edition.

1264
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:40,549
[SPEAKER_06]: For PlayStation, Jack Holmes Master of Puppets.

1265
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:45,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I would prefer Metallica's Master of Puppets, just saying.

1266
01:41:45,595 --> 01:41:47,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's freaking creepy looking.

1267
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:51,303
[SPEAKER_06]: On Switch and PlayStation, Withering Rooms.

1268
01:41:51,303 --> 01:41:55,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the three major consoles, Sea of Stars.

1269
01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:57,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is it, all on the 10th.

1270
01:41:58,564 --> 01:42:03,086
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, just a few more stories, then we'll be inviting your comments, calls, emails and all that good stuff.

1271
01:42:03,086 --> 01:42:07,708
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to email us participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send us an email.

1272
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:12,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to give us a call that is all done through our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1273
01:42:12,009 --> 01:42:14,470
[SPEAKER_03]: If you join the green room, we'll be taking calls in a little bit.

1274
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:20,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But we still have a few more stories for you, including kind of an I hate to bury the lead because this is another pretty big headline.

1275
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:23,954
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've considering it's a random week in May of sorts.

1276
01:42:23,954 --> 01:42:25,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of big news this week.

1277
01:42:25,615 --> 01:42:28,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a very interesting follow up, huh, Loki?

1278
01:42:29,417 --> 01:42:33,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so apparently Nintendo is not done with litigious stuff.

1279
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:37,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another week and more lawsuits and takedowns.

1280
01:42:37,942 --> 01:42:45,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they've initiated a mass takedown of backups and clones of Yuzu, of course, on GitHub.

1281
01:42:45,647 --> 01:42:52,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So over 8,000 repositories removed and they're trying to stop them from forking it.

1282
01:42:52,912 --> 01:42:57,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, there's been some

1283
01:42:59,008 --> 01:43:08,375
[SPEAKER_02]: They've removed reference mirrors and files of various Yuzu versions, as well as Pineapple and other Switch emulator based off the Yuzu code.

1284
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:15,660
[SPEAKER_02]: The, apparently, repositories they say offer provided access to Yuzu emulator or code based on Yuzu emulator.

1285
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:19,903
[SPEAKER_02]: The Yuzu emulator is primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games.

1286
01:43:19,903 --> 01:43:27,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, Yuzu illegally circumvents Nintendo's technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games.

1287
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:32,959
[SPEAKER_02]: GitHub has processed takedowns of the entire network of 8,535 repositories.

1288
01:43:40,816 --> 01:43:43,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if it's the internet that way, that is not going to stop it.

1289
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:47,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That emulator really got forked by Nintendo's legal team this week, didn't it?

1290
01:43:47,237 --> 01:43:51,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, but it just means they'll just push it underground.

1291
01:43:51,678 --> 01:43:52,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, ding.

1292
01:43:52,478 --> 01:43:53,659
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all this is going to do.

1293
01:43:53,659 --> 01:43:56,199
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to... So what have we learned this week?

1294
01:43:56,199 --> 01:44:01,240
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to have it on GitHub because Nintendo has their very litigious eye on GitHub.

1295
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,981
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not like this emulator.

1296
01:44:02,981 --> 01:44:08,742
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not like the fact that it plays current, you know, a current system that, you know, they're still selling in stores and all of this.

1297
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:10,843
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1298
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:24,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve

1299
01:44:47,429 --> 01:44:50,613
[SPEAKER_03]: where people are at work and it's a lot less visible.

1300
01:44:50,613 --> 01:45:00,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm sure if Nintendo, I'm sure Nintendo is not above doing a cease and desist to different discords and you know, but they'd have to find- I would say it's even, not even discords, it's gonna be forums.

1301
01:45:00,265 --> 01:45:03,890
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be forums that this is, you know, rampant in.

1302
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:25,114
[SPEAKER_03]: or fucking people are still on IRC and shit like it's yeah, there's IRC channels, you know, probably where people type of the more old school stuff that's a little it's not quite as out there and easy to find with a search because you know, I get hub they probably well, you know, it's public what's forked from what and then you know, searching for emulators that they probably found a bunch of them.

1303
01:45:25,114 --> 01:45:32,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's just it's gonna it's gonna make this harder for people to do but it's not gonna stop it.

1304
01:45:32,896 --> 01:45:33,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1305
01:45:34,502 --> 01:45:35,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1306
01:45:35,623 --> 01:45:46,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if you are doing emulators for the Nintendo Switch, it really should be for, you know, homebrew stuff and not to not to steal games, you know, not to play games for free.

1307
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:59,762
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is I do think there's something particularly fascinating about how having the Switch emulator on your computer can run some games better than they look on a Switch is interesting.

1308
01:46:01,055 --> 01:46:05,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I wouldn't play anything I don't already own, but it's interesting.

1309
01:46:05,376 --> 01:46:07,076
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1310
01:46:07,076 --> 01:46:08,316
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1311
01:46:08,316 --> 01:46:09,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1312
01:46:09,516 --> 01:46:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about for the switch to some more rumors.

1313
01:46:13,497 --> 01:46:16,258
[SPEAKER_03]: But this this one we're going to file under duh.

1314
01:46:16,258 --> 01:46:19,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, but we'll we'll talk about it anyway.

1315
01:46:19,798 --> 01:46:25,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently a leaker that has been correct before and will probably be correct again.

1316
01:46:25,939 --> 01:46:29,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Midori has leaked things out of Sega and Atlas before.

1317
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi

1318
01:46:55,652 --> 01:47:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: but we haven't heard anything about platforms but it does appear according to Midori every Atlas and Sega remake is releasing on Switch 2 now it doesn't to me it doesn't mean it's limited to Switch 2 and I just don't see Sega doing that but I bet you know if Nintendo is let's say they do plan on announcing the Switch 2 in June I'm still skeptical that that's happening but I see I see a possibility where they're not gonna do it

1319
01:47:24,566 --> 01:47:26,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I don't think they do either.

1320
01:47:26,267 --> 01:47:28,629
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see a pathway.

1321
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:32,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really bent on that fucking console isn't coming out this year.

1322
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:39,780
[SPEAKER_03]: But now with some of the recent leaks and things I'm like, I maybe like I but it's Yeah, I still would bet on next year.

1323
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:39,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh,

1324
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:46,435
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were to announce, well whenever they announce the Switch 2, fine, they do it January, February next year.

1325
01:47:46,435 --> 01:47:52,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever they announce it, these Sega partnerships would be some great things to put in there.

1326
01:47:52,184 --> 01:47:55,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine the sizzle reel they could have coming to Nintendo Switch 2.

1327
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:59,153
[SPEAKER_03]: CrazyTaxi, GoldenAxe, Jetset Radio

1328
01:48:16,912 --> 01:48:22,533
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Sega seems to work a lot with Nintendo these which is so weird, obviously, right?

1329
01:48:22,533 --> 01:48:30,395
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us that existed in the 80s and early 90s gaming scene sit here and go Sega, Nintendo being pals is so weird, but it's a different world now.

1330
01:48:30,395 --> 01:48:31,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots changed, right?

1331
01:48:31,736 --> 01:48:36,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get I feel like Sega gets a lot of announcements and Nintendo stuff.

1332
01:48:36,897 --> 01:48:38,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that happening.

1333
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a matter of time.

1334
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well for our last scheduled story tonight, unfortunately, a little bit of sad news here at the end.

1335
01:48:47,082 --> 01:48:47,563
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

1336
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was pretty floored when I saw this.

1337
01:48:53,742 --> 01:49:02,385
[SPEAKER_06]: But and and DBD fans are definitely, you know, going to be on this.

1338
01:49:02,385 --> 01:49:13,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoe Alexandria, who is the voice actor for The Unknown, was dealing with a pretty awful

1339
01:49:15,149 --> 01:49:23,255
[SPEAKER_06]: autoimmune illness and actually died on April 30th.

1340
01:49:23,255 --> 01:49:35,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were some posts that were made, one from the fourth that said that she had permanently decided to stop treatment for her illness, that the

1341
01:49:36,244 --> 01:49:48,628
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no quality of life on the medication and that, you know, she was having seizures and stiff person attacks and was ready just to live as it is.

1342
01:49:48,628 --> 01:50:01,252
[SPEAKER_06]: She was dealing with, I'm going to mispronounce this, non-paraneoplastic limbic autoimmune encephalitis and stiff person syndrome.

1343
01:50:02,692 --> 01:50:11,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty, any form of encephalitis has to do with swelling on the brain and this was caused by an immune response.

1344
01:50:11,876 --> 01:50:17,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty vicious.

1345
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:24,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the last three posts, one on the

1346
01:50:25,928 --> 01:50:33,216
[SPEAKER_06]: The 23rd was, sometimes things don't go as planned, and no matter how hard you try to make things work, sometimes God has something else in store.

1347
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:38,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes surrendering is the best course of action.

1348
01:50:38,341 --> 01:50:43,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she finally passed on April 30th, so...

1349
01:50:46,654 --> 01:50:48,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was only 29, right?

1350
01:50:48,715 --> 01:50:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she was born in 94.

1351
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:50,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible.

1352
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:52,975
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so sad.

1353
01:50:52,975 --> 01:50:57,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And she had been receiving such bullshit from people just because she's trans.

1354
01:50:57,296 --> 01:51:11,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I was going to say, like, you might remember, like, even if you don't play DBD, she was in the news just like two months ago when this first came out, because she kind of had some things to say about it, but then was like, people are taking me out of context, never mind, type of thing.

1355
01:51:11,419 --> 01:51:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I remember there was kind of like that that letter that she had posted.

1356
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Then she was like,

1357
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:19,246
[SPEAKER_03]: people are are reading into this the way I don't want them to read into it.

1358
01:51:19,246 --> 01:51:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind type of thing.

1359
01:51:20,428 --> 01:51:23,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And she would kind of wanted to work with behavior behind the scenes on her issues.

1360
01:51:23,312 --> 01:51:26,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had to do with some of the costumes and things I think that they were selling.

1361
01:51:26,578 --> 01:51:29,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and then of course, she was, unfortunately,

1362
01:51:31,567 --> 01:51:34,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Trans people get a lot of bullshit online and it sucks.

1363
01:51:34,508 --> 01:51:39,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Twitter, unfortunately, is a platform that empowers this stuff.

1364
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:48,553
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have the owner of, although, didn't the owner of Twitter respond to JK Rowling saying, maybe you should post about something else.

1365
01:51:48,553 --> 01:51:56,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw, I saw a screenshot of that make its way over to the other site that like, like, like, no, he was like, I agree with you, which sucks.

1366
01:51:56,256 --> 01:51:57,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Her opinion sucks.

1367
01:51:57,516 --> 01:51:58,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But even, even he's like,

1368
01:52:00,027 --> 01:52:04,049
[SPEAKER_03]: you need a new thing to talk about her anti trans rhetoric.

1369
01:52:04,049 --> 01:52:18,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason why I bring that up is that like, you know, unfortunately, trans individuals are facing this bullshit every day on social media, because certain people with a platform, like that woman that wrote the wizard book, empower it.

1370
01:52:18,454 --> 01:52:20,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

1371
01:52:20,435 --> 01:52:28,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that happens, people feel empowered to echo it and you know, say it to the faces of people impacted by it anyway.

1372
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:35,340
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's terrible.

1373
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:43,105
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm such a short life and dealing with such bullshit, but doing it with grace.

1374
01:52:43,105 --> 01:52:51,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I hope, well, she seemed to me pretty, pretty hardcore Christian.

1375
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:54,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, I hope her faith saw her through her end.

1376
01:52:56,291 --> 01:52:56,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Skullmom

1377
01:53:17,402 --> 01:53:17,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm

1378
01:53:32,876 --> 01:53:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: She's, you know, has has this art that she'll forever be memorialized in, which is is nice.

1379
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:41,380
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, just just terrible.

1380
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:44,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope maybe I almost said Blizzard.

1381
01:53:44,262 --> 01:53:44,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1382
01:53:44,482 --> 01:53:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope Behavior will consider maybe doing a fundraiser to raise awareness of this syndrome and, you know, possibly like maybe a charity skin for the unknown to maybe raise money for.

1383
01:53:55,688 --> 01:54:00,590
[SPEAKER_06]: There's there's a call out right now to do a charm like they did for Puppers.

1384
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that would be nice, too.

1385
01:54:01,971 --> 01:54:02,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1386
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:07,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1387
01:54:15,575 --> 01:54:16,635
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1388
01:54:16,635 --> 01:54:21,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you have some things you'd like to talk about, we'd like to invite you to participate with the listener roundtable.

1389
01:54:21,678 --> 01:54:34,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week we invite your phone calls, your emails and other comments and questions and chat if maybe we didn't get around to something you wanted to talk about tonight over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we tape live on Sunday nights.

1390
01:54:34,704 --> 01:54:37,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw one email sneak in there.

1391
01:54:37,465 --> 01:54:38,005
[SPEAKER_03]: This one.

1392
01:54:38,005 --> 01:54:38,565
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one.

1393
01:54:38,565 --> 01:54:39,866
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, let's get to the email tonight.

1394
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:44,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, as soon as it opens.

1395
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:46,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi here.

1396
01:54:46,691 --> 01:54:49,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say I appreciate listening to the show so much.

1397
01:54:49,812 --> 01:54:51,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to give a shoutout to DarkSakura.

1398
01:54:51,653 --> 01:54:52,393
[SPEAKER_06]: To me?

1399
01:54:52,393 --> 01:54:54,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1400
01:54:54,194 --> 01:54:56,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I recently picked up a game... Yeah, why?

1401
01:54:56,595 --> 01:54:57,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

1402
01:54:57,095 --> 01:54:57,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

1403
01:54:57,395 --> 01:54:59,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Just talked about called Demon's Tilt.

1404
01:54:59,556 --> 01:55:00,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ignoring Rob.

1405
01:55:03,554 --> 01:55:06,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never really understood why y'all like pinball so much.

1406
01:55:06,555 --> 01:55:11,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my quest to try something new, I thought I'd pick up the game on Switch and see what I thought of it.

1407
01:55:11,177 --> 01:55:16,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can safely say DS knows what she's talking about with the classic Game of the Week segment.

1408
01:55:16,279 --> 01:55:18,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much for all that you guys do.

1409
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really enjoying the game.

1410
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Love y'all.

1411
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay awesome.

1412
01:55:21,221 --> 01:55:22,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, Mishi.

1413
01:55:22,941 --> 01:55:25,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww, thank you.

1414
01:55:25,142 --> 01:55:26,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, DarkSakura.

1415
01:55:26,563 --> 01:55:29,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Proof that you're educating the children out there.

1416
01:55:29,784 --> 01:55:30,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1417
01:55:30,264 --> 01:55:31,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

1418
01:55:31,385 --> 01:55:31,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and

1419
01:55:34,167 --> 01:55:42,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Demon's Tilt is like such a love letter to like Devil's Crush and Alien Crush and Jackie Crush.

1420
01:55:42,609 --> 01:55:46,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's perfect.

1421
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:48,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

1422
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:49,310
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1423
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:50,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the best emails.

1424
01:55:50,571 --> 01:55:53,411
[SPEAKER_03]: The one the one to just tell us how great we are.

1425
01:55:53,411 --> 01:55:54,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We love those emails.

1426
01:55:54,491 --> 01:55:57,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always a feel good feeling going into a Monday.

1427
01:55:57,792 --> 01:56:00,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have no regrets getting Mishi into Avatar.

1428
01:56:02,614 --> 01:56:05,738
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, again, participate at Orange Lounge Radio.

1429
01:56:05,738 --> 01:56:10,925
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email.

1430
01:56:10,925 --> 01:56:12,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dot com.

1431
01:56:12,748 --> 01:56:14,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dot com.

1432
01:56:14,410 --> 01:56:15,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1433
01:56:15,692 --> 01:56:17,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

1434
01:56:17,594 --> 01:56:21,576
[SPEAKER_02]: HellDivers 2 is no longer supported by the Playstation Network, but the dev team is encouraging

1435
01:56:40,615 --> 01:56:49,805
[SPEAKER_02]: to write those negative reviews because it's helping them get extra ammo for fighting against Sony about this.

1436
01:56:49,805 --> 01:56:56,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is Sony's decision, not Team Arrowhead or whatever the Arrowhead Studios was that put that together.

1437
01:56:58,416 --> 01:57:03,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so they said essentially players making their displeasures known through reviews, refunds, etc.

1438
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:06,062
[SPEAKER_02]: gives us more pull in the discussions with Sony.

1439
01:57:06,062 --> 01:57:07,603
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't read our Discord.

1440
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:08,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, does it?

1441
01:57:08,343 --> 01:57:16,109
[SPEAKER_02]: To see the game's popularity suffer in ratings, but discussions are ongoing and our team is on the side of the players in this fight.

1442
01:57:16,109 --> 01:57:22,634
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unrealistic to expect players to make PSN accounts in different regions to get past the account linking requirement.

1443
01:57:22,634 --> 01:57:23,494
[SPEAKER_02]: We are aware of that.

1444
01:57:23,494 --> 01:57:25,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Discussions are ongoing.

1445
01:57:25,416 --> 01:57:26,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case,

1446
01:57:27,447 --> 01:57:28,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Rated Down.

1447
01:57:43,956 --> 01:57:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: going against the publisher.

1448
01:57:46,237 --> 01:57:49,078
[SPEAKER_03]: How often does that happen in games?

1449
01:57:49,078 --> 01:57:50,659
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of wild to me.

1450
01:57:50,659 --> 01:57:53,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we all kind of know like Arrowhead.

1451
01:57:53,481 --> 01:57:55,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be in their Discord, though.

1452
01:57:55,201 --> 01:57:58,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be in the Discord because this looks like a Discord screenshot.

1453
01:57:58,503 --> 01:58:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, you know, you know, when you say something there, it's going.

1454
01:58:01,705 --> 01:58:04,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know that, you fucking better learn.

1455
01:58:04,286 --> 01:58:08,088
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a developer, that is really wild.

1456
01:58:09,428 --> 01:58:20,510
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says, I just saw a video that someone cut up, Yakko's Nations of the World, but it's just countries that can't play Helldiver 2.

1457
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:25,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not funny, but leave it to the internet to fucking... It's gallows humor.

1458
01:58:25,471 --> 01:58:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yes, gallows humor.

1459
01:58:27,412 --> 01:58:30,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just to fucking meme it up.

1460
01:58:30,973 --> 01:58:32,153
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, hold on, hold on.

1461
01:58:33,391 --> 01:58:36,634
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt dropped the link and I'm sorry.

1462
01:58:36,634 --> 01:58:38,516
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've got you know, I've got to do this.

1463
01:58:38,516 --> 01:58:39,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got I'm sorry.

1464
01:58:39,257 --> 01:58:49,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to Jamaica, Republic, Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Guyana, Belize, Bermuda, Bahamas, Tobago, Suriname, French Guiana, Barbados and Guam.

1465
01:58:51,926 --> 01:58:57,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Delbania, Iraq and Iran, there's Syria, Jordan, Bogdanoz, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan, Bangladesh, Mongolia.

1466
01:59:16,175 --> 01:59:22,677
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and I agree record WN put it quite succinctly in chat saying GG Arrowhead.

1467
01:59:22,677 --> 01:59:25,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I big agree on that.

1468
01:59:25,058 --> 01:59:28,880
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is going to be fascinating to see develop.

1469
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:32,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious what this whole situation is going to look like in seven more days.

1470
01:59:32,921 --> 01:59:40,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if if Sony ends up having to succumb to this pressure by the developer.

1471
01:59:40,184 --> 01:59:41,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very interesting.

1472
01:59:41,244 --> 01:59:43,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how it develops in the next seven days.

1473
01:59:46,566 --> 01:59:48,807
[SPEAKER_02]: They also had, what was it?

1474
01:59:48,807 --> 01:59:54,631
[SPEAKER_02]: The CEO of Arrowhead, though, made a comment today saying that, I do have my part to play.

1475
01:59:54,631 --> 01:59:56,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not blameless in all of this.

1476
01:59:56,052 --> 02:00:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my decision to disable account linking at launch so players could play the game.

1477
02:00:00,654 --> 02:00:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not ensure players were aware of the requirements and we didn't talk about it enough.

1478
02:00:06,478 --> 02:00:08,359
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew this was about six months before launch.

1479
02:00:08,359 --> 02:00:12,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be mandatory for online PS titles.

1480
02:00:14,025 --> 02:00:17,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1481
02:00:17,748 --> 02:00:26,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, comment from chat, DarkTutsuya, following up on, did I convince myself that this was a thing?

1482
02:00:26,233 --> 02:00:33,518
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTutsuya says, there was a Super Nintendo version of sorts of Nintendo World Championship called PowerFest.

1483
02:00:33,518 --> 02:00:34,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a different name.

1484
02:00:34,439 --> 02:00:35,580
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

1485
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Bros.

1486
02:00:36,861 --> 02:00:38,282
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 Lost Levels.

1487
02:00:38,282 --> 02:00:39,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Griffey Jr.'

1488
02:00:39,503 --> 02:00:41,124
[SPEAKER_03]: 's Home Run Derby Mode.

1489
02:00:41,124 --> 02:00:41,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I

1490
02:00:42,256 --> 02:00:45,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot that Ken Griffey Jr.

1491
02:00:45,638 --> 02:00:46,479
[SPEAKER_03]: was a thing.

1492
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:52,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I remember that he was a person, but I forgot that that was a game until you said that just now.

1493
02:00:52,862 --> 02:00:54,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I remember the game.

1494
02:00:54,463 --> 02:00:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lap in Super Mario Kart was the PowerFS cartridge.

1495
02:00:58,886 --> 02:01:07,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwolf again with the very macabre humor in chat saying, incoming closure of Arrowhead Studios.

1496
02:01:07,273 --> 02:01:16,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, due to the issues from their latest title and the losses therein, we have made the difficult decision to close Arrowhead Studios in order to compensate.

1497
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:22,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's some very dark humor.

1498
02:01:22,485 --> 02:01:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1499
02:01:25,506 --> 02:01:26,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's it.

1500
02:01:26,767 --> 02:01:28,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We got no more emails.

1501
02:01:28,267 --> 02:01:30,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We got no calls.

1502
02:01:30,128 --> 02:01:30,888
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1503
02:01:30,888 --> 02:01:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you want to do something?

1504
02:01:32,229 --> 02:01:32,969
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1505
02:01:32,969 --> 02:01:34,110
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we have nothing.

1506
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:35,651
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we ain't found shit.

1507
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:36,491
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1508
02:01:36,491 --> 02:01:39,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then on that note, we're gonna wrap it up for tonight.

1509
02:01:39,212 --> 02:01:41,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll be back in seven days.

1510
02:01:41,673 --> 02:01:44,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And this news could be developing quickly on the Helldivers front.

1511
02:01:44,235 --> 02:01:45,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, other things.

1512
02:01:45,095 --> 02:01:48,337
[SPEAKER_03]: This ended up being a pretty busy Newsweek, all things considered.

1513
02:01:48,337 --> 02:01:50,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we'll be back in seven days.

1514
02:01:50,738 --> 02:01:51,318
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime,

1515
02:01:52,078 --> 02:01:55,421
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, if you enjoyed listening to Orange Sans Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

1516
02:01:55,421 --> 02:01:59,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1517
02:01:59,825 --> 02:02:07,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show, goes an awful long way.

1518
02:02:07,412 --> 02:02:09,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate all of that.

1519
02:02:09,693 --> 02:02:11,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get around to final thoughts.

1520
02:02:11,755 --> 02:02:15,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura, I know you're going to be streaming some tonight after the show.

1521
02:02:15,819 --> 02:02:17,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

1522
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:27,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you need to slow down and just appreciate what's around you.

1523
02:02:27,365 --> 02:02:28,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Just slow down.

1524
02:02:28,706 --> 02:02:30,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for once, just slow down.

1525
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:31,608
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1526
02:02:31,608 --> 02:02:33,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell Sonic to slow down.

1527
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:35,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not telling Sonic to slow down.

1528
02:02:35,051 --> 02:02:36,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic is irrelevant.

1529
02:02:36,792 --> 02:02:37,773
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that's fine.

1530
02:02:37,773 --> 02:02:38,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Irrelevant!

1531
02:02:38,753 --> 02:02:39,874
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1532
02:02:39,874 --> 02:02:41,015
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DarkSakura, have a good stream.

1533
02:02:41,015 --> 02:02:42,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you later.

1534
02:02:42,276 --> 02:02:42,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1535
02:02:42,836 --> 02:02:44,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1536
02:02:44,458 --> 02:02:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Loki, that means we go to you.

1537
02:02:45,598 --> 02:02:46,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought tonight.

1538
02:02:49,642 --> 02:02:52,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1539
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Loki is frozen.

1540
02:02:54,487 --> 02:02:56,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is awkward.

1541
02:02:56,048 --> 02:02:57,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's frozen.

1542
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:59,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently I'm sitting here by myself.

1543
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:01,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

1544
02:03:01,153 --> 02:03:03,275
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Loki can hear me just know I can't hear you.

1545
02:03:03,275 --> 02:03:05,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I think it's rebooting.

1546
02:03:05,818 --> 02:03:08,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his camera may have kicked on and off.

1547
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:11,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now I see an angry looking Loki has come back.

1548
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:23,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it freeze framed at just the appropriate moment where Loki looked really deep in thought, but Loki is back and looks like he's stewing at the controls there.

1549
02:03:23,121 --> 02:03:25,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, can you hear me?

1550
02:03:25,361 --> 02:03:27,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my audio cut out.

1551
02:03:27,082 --> 02:03:28,262
[SPEAKER_02]: My mixer is something.

1552
02:03:28,262 --> 02:03:28,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear you.

1553
02:03:28,742 --> 02:03:29,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure did.

1554
02:03:29,302 --> 02:03:31,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You, you, you went to hell.

1555
02:03:31,843 --> 02:03:34,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

1556
02:03:34,223 --> 02:03:37,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you hear the words that are coming out of my mouth?

1557
02:03:37,064 --> 02:03:39,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1558
02:03:39,044 --> 02:03:41,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Final, can somebody, can we sign to Loki?

1559
02:03:41,985 --> 02:03:43,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Give your final thought.

1560
02:03:44,261 --> 02:03:46,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts.

1561
02:03:46,602 --> 02:03:47,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Read my lips.

1562
02:03:47,303 --> 02:03:51,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thought, Loki.

1563
02:03:51,525 --> 02:03:56,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's final thought is tech problems are unavoidable.

1564
02:03:56,187 --> 02:04:03,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, all right.

1565
02:04:03,251 --> 02:04:05,012
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is this.

1566
02:04:05,012 --> 02:04:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's got to work again.

1567
02:04:06,893 --> 02:04:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It glitched out there.

1568
02:04:07,794 --> 02:04:08,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

1569
02:04:08,894 --> 02:04:09,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1570
02:04:09,255 --> 02:04:10,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Strong finish.

1571
02:04:10,015 --> 02:04:10,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1572
02:04:10,315 --> 02:04:10,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1573
02:04:10,976 --> 02:04:11,616
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki.

1574
02:04:11,616 --> 02:04:13,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we've got you back, your final thought, please.

1575
02:04:14,195 --> 02:04:15,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know what was up with that.

1576
02:04:15,336 --> 02:04:24,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything like my USB hub just shut off and turn back on again, which is great for brand new USB hub I just purchased to have that happen.

1577
02:04:24,242 --> 02:04:26,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Love to see it.

1578
02:04:26,503 --> 02:04:27,584
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your final thought?

1579
02:04:27,584 --> 02:04:29,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, love to see it.

1580
02:04:29,045 --> 02:04:30,226
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1581
02:04:30,226 --> 02:04:37,030
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is, if it ain't broken, is it really Orange Lounge Radio?

1582
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: On that thought, have a wonderful week, everybody.

1583
02:04:40,052 --> 02:04:41,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in seven days.

1584
02:04:41,153 --> 02:04:42,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy gaming and all that stuff.

1585
02:04:42,634 --> 02:04:42,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1586
02:04:45,273 --> 02:04:49,834
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1587
02:04:49,834 --> 02:04:54,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1588
02:04:54,916 --> 02:05:03,739
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for our live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

1589
02:05:03,739 --> 02:05:13,282
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1590
02:05:16,085 --> 02:05:16,831
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
