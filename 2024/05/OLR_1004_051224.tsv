9873	10493	It's time.
10493	11033	It's coming.
11033	11854	It's really happening.
11854	16675	Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be announced sometime in the next 10 months.
16675	26959	Despite Nintendo's communication being immensely streamlined with its E3 Treehouse presentations and directs made entirely on its own schedule, its flagship console is obviously unique enough to be the exception to these practices.
26959	29459	This is the Redundancy Department of Redundancy headline.
29459	34561	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34561	36782	Starting right now in the show, every gamer has a voice.
39827	42748	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42748	47089	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47089	59893	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1004 of our show for tonight, May the 12th of 2024.
59893	63093	Happy Mother's Day to all our gamer mommies out there.
63093	66995	If that label applies to you, then apply it.
66995	68355	And also a special
68795	83762	Happy birthday to Bobby Blackwolf, who we share the stage with at the Voice of Geeks Network each and every Sunday night, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after Birthday Boy Bobby Blackwolf, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
83762	86143	Happy 29th birthday to Bobby.
86143	94147	I am joined by, of course, I'm Rob Roberts, in case you forgot, and I am joined every week by the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
94147	95127	Hey.
95127	96208	Hey, how's it going?
97509	98349	I was going.
98349	101790	Yeah, weekends always too short, but it is what it is.
101790	102631	Truth.
102631	104791	The weekends have been way too short lately.
104791	106332	It's just flies by.
106332	107512	It's unfortunate.
107512	110293	It doesn't help that I spent half of yesterday sleeping.
110293	113214	I had such a long busy week.
113214	113574	I did.
113574	115494	I crashed hard yesterday.
115494	117095	It was it was something else.
117095	117795	And then I walked 10,000 steps.
117795	117875	Yeah.
121209	126452	But because Pikmin had a challenge weekend thing in Pikmin Bloom.
126452	129293	And if you get 10,000 steps, you get a badge.
129293	132655	And you know what that badge means?
132655	133915	You have a badge.
133915	134416	That's right.
134416	135236	It means nothing.
135236	142740	But I have a little electronic pixel thing in my profile that says I, I was a special kid today.
142740	144301	That was it.
144301	145301	But I did it.
145301	146502	And I went out with friends to do it.
146502	149043	So I guess there's that whole like, yay, doing things together.
149043	149963	I don't know.
149963	150224	Anyway.
152345	156447	Did you accomplish anything big in video games this week, DarkSakura?
156447	157647	I played a bunch of them.
157647	159808	All right, well, we'll get in.
159808	163009	I did beat a game.
163009	166370	Oh, well, we'll get into that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.
166370	171412	Let me mention though, you mentioned next week, you may or may not be here because you got a big thing you're going to, right?
172503	178184	Right, next weekend is Golden State Pinball Festival in Lodi, California.
178184	182926	And if anyone is going to go, please find me.
182926	194689	I actually may be doing some commentary on TheSpinnerIsLit, or at least the one for the local pinball group in Lodi, I think.
194689	197889	I'll have to find the channel name again because it's been a minute.
200450	213045	I'm going to be hanging around and doing stuff and playing some games and reporting and there will be little TikToks posted hither and yon so yeah I kind of want to go I've never been
214127	216750	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
231566	245604	On Friday night there is like a dinner thing for people involved in the group that I'll be attending, but I have work that day mostly.
246585	248507	Same, I mean, I can always go at night.
248507	249708	It's in Lodi, right?
249708	250609	It's not that far.
250609	252711	Yeah, it's at the Grape Festival.
252711	255034	Yeah, it's not that far.
255034	256035	Yeah, I'll probably go inside.
256035	264964	Well, I was thinking, so at the end of Bobby's show tonight, you know, because we're listening to it usually while we're sitting here waiting to go, he was talking about the new John Wick table that got announced.
264964	268627	And, you know, you were mentioning, so I was thinking about how I'm kind of sad.
268627	269308	It doesn't look
269528	270168	DragonCon 2021
299428	300949	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Atlanta's full.
323934	326517	And driving in Atlanta is worse than Los Angeles.
326517	327718	Atlanta's full.
327718	328720	No more.
328720	331883	No, but so what was I really?
331883	333305	No vacancy.
333305	334166	Yeah, no vacancy.
334166	337650	The big no vacancy sign outside of Atlanta is flashing.
339091	349103	Okay, Southern Fright always has like the cool stern presence and you get to play a lot of pinball machines, including usually new pinball tables like last year, Venom was, you know, everywhere, which I think was their new table.
349103	352367	But you were saying you get a little bit of that at the Golden State Pinball Expo too.
352367	354469	So maybe you get to peek at this new John Wick table.
354469	355571	I mean, nothing's confirmed, but
356314	357494	I'm hoping so.
357494	373119	Dave Stern has had a presence there with demos, although I think if there were going to be a convention that would be most likely to have an appearance at, it would be California Extreme, which is next month, is it?
373119	373840	Yeah.
373840	377601	We have a room for California Extreme, so we'll be there for the whole thing.
378246	382548	I haven't been to California extreme in years, years.
382548	383728	So it's great.
383728	384209	I know.
384209	384509	I know.
384509	388170	But again, it's just always that conflict with my very busy personal life.
388170	391852	Um, but I'd love to I'd love to see that.
391852	397414	I was gonna say the Stern presence here is at the Sacramento coin op downtown.
397414	401316	They have a big star and I keep meaning to get down there to play games, but they were being remodeled for a while.
401316	403797	And I think they finally reopened recently.
403797	405458	And I haven't seen it since the remodel.
405458	405938	But you know,
406158	408899	I have to ask Dan who's in charge of the tables there.
408899	414542	Not only do they have pinball, they just got a Stepmania X machine, which is a pretty big deal.
414542	418785	You know, the kind of the spiritual successor to DDR of sorts.
418785	420746	I guess DDR is still going though.
420746	423247	So it's it's kind of both things going on.
423247	426749	In fact, we have a story on that later, but I'll, I'll wait for later.
426749	430151	Um, for now, though, I can't let him just sit there any longer.
430151	432652	I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
434776	437799	Hello, I haven't been feeling myself lately.
437799	439160	Joking aside, I'm actually sick.
439160	446306	But I was like, what in the Bobby Blackwolf voice changer on your fucking microphone?
446306	448808	Are you running tonight?
448808	450929	Do you have the demon voice he does too?
450929	451810	We might need it tonight.
451810	455473	Uh, yes, I do, actually.
455473	456934	Oh, great.
456934	458075	Jesus.
458075	458616	Jesus.
461673	465175	or as Travis Donovan used to call it DJ Satan was that voice.
465175	466456	Yeah.
466456	474340	Anyway, uh, I was gonna ask what I really wanted to ask about was the, you know, because I see a game with a cat playing in the background.
474340	477222	And of course, I'm always going to be interested in a game with a cat.
477222	478722	Although I feel like I've seen that one.
478722	481604	That one just came out like this last couple weeks, right?
481604	483265	Yeah, yeah.
483265	484486	Cat.
484486	485246	I can't remember the name.
485246	486046	Little Kitty Big City.
486046	486407	That's it.
486407	487087	Little Kitty Big City.
488905	491386	Yeah, have you played it or just watching it on?
491386	494207	I have I finished it because it's a very short game.
494207	495267	Oh, nice.
495267	496428	All right.
496428	497708	Cool.
497708	499469	I was a little kitty in a big city.
499469	500629	It was great.
500629	502050	It's like a Japanese city.
502050	504650	So it's a it's a Japanese kitty in a Japanese city.
504650	505511	And it's great.
505511	510712	And it's yeah, we're checking out but it's a cute little game.
510712	512613	Can you look in the camera and say that again?
512613	516154	I was a little kitty in a big city.
516154	517855	I was a little kitty in a big city.
518683	520104	Okay, thank you.
520104	521024	There we go.
521024	523305	Let's look right at the camera.
523305	523705	Got it?
523705	524226	Okay.
524226	525186	Yes.
525186	529768	I was a little kitty in a big city.
529768	530349	Clip it!
530349	533370	Okay.
533370	535371	Anyway, let's see.
535371	540273	In chat, Bobby Blackwolf is asking, isn't this like Untitled Goose Game but with a cat?
540273	543935	Or Johnny Wufei calls it Actual Titled Cat Game.
545646	546607	Kind of.
546607	550270	It has that same like kind of visual style to it.
550270	552171	And there is some things you're doing.
552171	555354	You're not necessarily terrorizing people so much.
555354	563380	You do a little bit of terrorizing, but it's mostly helping animals around the town and stuff doing different things.
563380	566903	But there is there is some minor terrorizing of the pedestrians.
566903	572207	You do end up stealing a cell phone at one time and you can knock people over.
572207	572607	As a cat.
574093	578256	Yeah, as a cat, it's it's like, yeah, it's like an exploration game.
578256	579497	I mean, it's probably.
579497	583120	I played it for about four hours.
583120	589565	I haven't 100% of it, but I did most of the things I'd say, like 90% of the game.
589565	592427	So it's probably like a six hour game at most.
592427	594949	OK, there's nothing wrong with a short and sweet game.
594949	596330	Yeah, no, no, not not at all.
596330	599392	And it's it's it's like you collect hats.
599392	601414	So there's lots of hats that you can wear.
602354	603095	Thanks for watching!
625323	626425	Bobby Blackwolf in chat.
626425	632175	I swear there's more people chatting tonight, but Bobby's just hitting a lot of zingers, or I want to make him feel good because it's his birthday.
632175	633237	You pick.
633237	638325	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, short and sweet games are great, like Little Kitty, Big City, and Hi-Fi Rush.
639636	640937	Well, hold that thought.
640937	642237	We're going to get into the news here.
642237	643758	And I'm sure y'all are thinking about it.
643758	644879	Yes, yes, we will.
644879	646099	We will be talking about that.
646099	648840	But first, let's do a follow up here.
648840	651882	We don't usually get to do a follow up as a kickoff topic.
651882	659866	But how about this, and the joys of doing a live show that then pushes to the podcast feed later that night.
659866	660246	And I've, I've
660546	664327	I've been very good over the last probably 500 episodes.
664327	673271	I wasn't always good in the history of this show, but I would say probably ever since the All Games move, which was a long time ago, quite frankly, if not the VOG move, certainly.
673271	681234	I'm pretty good about getting the show all packaged and put on the podcast feed by probably midnight Pacific time.
681234	689677	By the time I go to bed Pacific time, it's up on the podcast feed right around the time those overseas across the Atlantic are waking up, they can download it and do all that.
690437	706190	once in a great while maybe because of a technical mess up or I have to do some deeper editing or just a personal engagement right after the show once in a great while maybe it's delayed by a day but for the most part it hits the feed by midnight pacific by the time this show hit the feed
707071	712493	There was already a huge update to what we spent the entire opening of the show last week talking about.
712493	714894	And that was, of course, Helldivers 2.
714894	723377	We got into it with the debate last week, but it was good spirited debate talking about the industry and everything, talking about all the perspectives and what we could do about it.
723377	724318	Well, it turns out
724938	726739	We didn't need to do anything further about it.
726739	731361	Sony was already preparing the press release to change course.
731361	735843	PlayStation wrote in a tweet that went out at nine o'clock Pacific.
735843	739225	So this was timed nine o'clock Pacific on May 5th.
739225	742967	So literally less than 45 minutes after our show ended, probably less than 30.
744605	749470	Helldivers fans, we've heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update.
749470	759460	The May 6th update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30th, will not be moving forward.
759980	764042	We're still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable.
764042	769945	Thanks again for your continued support of Helldivers 2 and we'll keep you updated on future plans.
769945	776268	So all of that talk we were talking about how to get to Sony and how to get get our way and all that.
776268	776809	Never mind.
778139	786330	Well, okay, I say that, but I think some of us also kind of see that well, this has worked for now.
786330	791416	But for example, we have Ghosts of Tsushima, the director's cut is coming.
791416	793519	I believe that is still going to require
794059	797401	a Steam and PlayStation-linked account to play online.
797401	807625	Now, there is a single-player mode you may not need, and they yanked Ghost of Tsushima's sales in many, many countries, pretty much all the countries where there isn't PlayStation Network.
807625	817309	So you can see already that Sony is laying the groundwork to do this in the future, and that groundwork is they will not sell in the non-PlayStation Network countries in the future.
817309	818190	That is the solution.
818670	822133	Mike Deft is confirming Ghost of Tsushima only needs a PSN account for multiplayer, but still pretty crappy.
847250	850451	Not to mention that now a lot of countries don't have access to those games now.
850451	852031	That is true.
852031	856272	So this issue isn't going away necessarily.
856272	867734	But for now, for Helldivers, and for that game and that experience, the review bombing and the vocalize on Twitter and all the other things have had their effect.
867734	869295	They reverse course.
869295	869715	For now.
870515	872076	Tada.
872076	873377	So all right.
873377	882121	Anyway, um, let's move on and talk about the other big story going on because that was in the news for like a day.
882121	887664	And then some other big news dropped and just stole the whole damn show.
887664	890526	Everybody's talking about this Loki.
890526	892587	Can you recap what's going on at Microsoft?
893416	897098	So Microsoft decided, hey, you know, we have a lot of goodwill.
897098	901360	What do you say we just burn all of it right about now?
901360	902201	And that's what they did.
902201	907764	So, um, well, essentially, you simply you made this news so simple and easy to digest.
907764	908885	It's just easy.
908885	910926	It's just going to break it down for a bit.
910926	912106	It just works.
912106	912627	It just works.
914417	924840	So Microsoft announced that they're going to be shutting down four studios that they had acquired under the Bethesda Xenimax umbrella.
924840	936043	Those studios being Arcane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and well Roundhouse Games is actually being absorbed into Xenimax Online.
937204	943709	Arcane Austin worked on Redfall as well as, you know, they previously did like the Dishonored series and that type of stuff.
943709	956119	Tango Gameworks did the extremely popular and, you know, hitting all the possible accolades that Microsoft ever would possibly want this game to hit, Hi-Fi Rush.
956119	962385	And then AlphaDog Games did Mobile Doom.
962385	964086	So with that,
966184	967665	Why?
967665	984475	Well, according to Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios, these changes are grounded in prioritizing high impact titles and further investing in Bethesda's portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds, which you've nurtured over many decades.
984475	986597	In other words, they're going to keep making Fallout.
986597	993461	They're going to keep making Elder Scrolls and they're not going to take risks on anything else.
996437	1012684	Along with that, you know, they're saying that they're hoping to consolidate their Bethesda studio team so they can invest more deeply in their portfolio games with new IP and smaller number of roles across selected publishing corporate teams will be eliminated.
1012684	1013505	I don't like...
1015457	1023181	Arcane Austin makes some sense a little bit with, you know, how bad Redfall did.
1023181	1028544	Now that's to say I would still cut them some slack because of all of the Dishonored stuff.
1028544	1030845	Yeah, and Prey was pretty well received too.
1030845	1032066	Prey, exactly.
1032066	1035728	And considering that this is like a game that sounds like it was more of like
1036528	1055656	by committee by sea level suite executives saying oh hey we want we want you to make a live service game and you have to like force it in there and it has to be out on xyz date period exactly so i think there's a lot of that that needs to be accounted for there
1056237	1060461	I don't love this whole studio makes one flop game and they're shut down.
1060461	1061322	But I get it.
1061322	1068371	The optics of when they announced that this studio was shutting down, there definitely was that moment of, well, yeah, Redfall wasn't great.
1068371	1069892	But it was like, I hate that.
1069892	1071054	I kind of hate that.
1071054	1075239	That we're conditioned to accept that.
1075239	1076100	Loki, what were you saying?
1077992	1082874	Oh, I was going to say, well, that makes some sense or like you can kind of paint that picture.
1082874	1094357	However, Tango Gameworks with Hi-Fi Rush, which sold great, won tons of awards and was generally one of the best games that came out last year for the Xbox platform.
1094357	1095738	That makes no sense.
1097970	1103878	And Evil Within, which many people were hoping for a sequel to as well.
1103878	1107643	A second sequel, before I get corrected in chat.
1107643	1111808	So it's like, yeah, oh, well, bad game, studio gets closed.
1111808	1113350	Good game, studio gets closed.
1113959	1116061	What?
1116061	1118122	That logic doesn't make any sense.
1118122	1129592	I definitely am not going to defend the logic, but I do want to point out that Tango Gameworks was already having some transitions behind the scenes before this news.
1129592	1139360	Most notably, Shinji Mikami had already left Tango Gameworks quite some time, and apparently he even
1140060	1141221	I don't know if he tweeted.
1141221	1142322	Yeah, he tweeted.
1142322	1145545	He said, tango closed sad.
1145545	1149248	That was his reaction, which I mean, is really all that needs to be said.
1149248	1152951	But he he left some time ago and has founded a new company.
1152951	1155853	Now again, I certainly am not defending the decision.
1155853	1162479	But it is one of those things where you kind of go, Hmm, someone maybe saw the writing on the wall and got out.
1164522	1165702	So yeah, possibly.
1165702	1166683	Yeah.
1166683	1171765	And even still, though, like having a Japanese studio, you're trying to work your way into the Japanese market.
1171765	1173925	Like, why?
1173925	1175426	Why just throw that all away?
1175426	1185250	Like, I don't understand, especially after they had a profitable game and by their own admission, like it hit every metric that they could possibly have for that game.
1185250	1188191	And then some exceeded those metrics.
1188191	1191412	That was Microsoft's phrasing on that, like,
1192772	1195114	Here's, this is, this is what it is.
1195114	1196995	This is what it is.
1196995	1202618	And it's so obvious, you know, and Phil Spencer's taken a lot of heat for this, what's going on this week.
1202618	1204380	And I'm not, I'm not here to defend him.
1204380	1214246	I realize I've talked very up on Phil Spencer, because I do think especially on the personality side of things, he's brought a lot of good things to the game industry.
1214246	1216467	I'm not here to defend him.
1216467	1217048	However,
1217848	1221091	I do feel like this whole thing reeks of something that wasn't his decision.
1221091	1222873	This came from above him.
1222873	1230940	This reeks of something that came from the highest of highest levels, at the Microsoft level, not even considering the gaming's division.
1230940	1234984	And the reason why I say that is because we have all these stories coming out left and right
1235484	1236405	Sarah Bond
1256205	1269495	I kinda, like, if I was in her shoes, which I'm really glad I'm not, I don't know what else there is to say because it just reeked of, it was not her decision, but she had to defend this decision that was coming up from even above her.
1269495	1273417	And Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Microsoft is scrutinizing Xbox.
1273417	1274898	And that's it.
1274898	1275339	That's it.
1275339	1278081	Microsoft is scrutinizing Xbox at the highest level.
1278081	1282344	And the thing that sucks about this is that this was very much a spreadsheet.
1283064	1284125	What's coming in?
1284125	1285146	What's coming out?
1285146	1286167	What's the plan?
1286167	1286608	What's this?
1286608	1294636	And do you think that spreadsheet said, oh, this was up for so many Game of the Year awards or oh, this has so much goodwill in the community?
1294636	1298259	No, these cuts were made based on red ink only.
1298259	1303404	That's where these cuts were made by people who don't know anything about video games.
1304185	1310633	And that was the funniest part about it too is because like right after they closed those studios, they're like, hey, you know what we really need?
1310633	1313796	We need smaller games that are winning awards and stuff like that.
1313796	1315458	It's like you already had one.
1315458	1318441	You just you closed the studio.
1318441	1318662	Yeah.
1319082	1334729	Well, and it goes to show the disconnect again between I think the people that are actually running Xbox and the people in the even higher suite at Microsoft and God, probably wanting to put even more people on Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Copilot because that's where they see the future and all that stuff.
1335976	1344839	Here's you know, and I've kind of thought about the real like ugly response this whole thing has had on social media and rightfully so I get why people are pissed.
1344839	1346480	Hi-Fi Rush was a great game.
1346480	1361025	It was also great to see Microsoft investing in some pretty cool things and kind of carving out this own identity for themselves that they have had a very hard time navigating in this war with Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Switch or whatever you want to call it.
1361025	1364646	They've had a very hard time carving out their own identity beyond Halo.
1364966	1367250	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1379412	1397993	We've been sitting here for years and I don't mean just us here at Orange Lounge Radio but we're part of it and I think a lot of you that are really passionate about video games and a lot of people out on the internet have been sitting here for a very long time defending this idea and supporting this idea and uplifting this idea that video games are art.
1398894	1400535	Video games are art.
1400535	1405998	And a lot of people saw Hi-Fi Rush as a pretty cool piece of art that like that's a neat video game.
1405998	1408219	That's where we want to see video games go.
1408219	1418304	This week was a kick in the face reminder that video games are in fact, a business.
1418304	1418884	And that sucks.
1421314	1433224	Now, it's not to say that there can't be an overlap, that art and business can kind of go hand in hand a little bit, because just look at the movie industry, specifically the big budget movie industry.
1433224	1444413	But we're seeing a lot of extremely similar painful points happening over in that industry, because the business is making the decisions, not the art.
1445478	1465951	And it's just, it's all the corporate, the over corporatization of the world basically that is kind of causing all this because if you look at it's not just like in the video game space, it's everywhere that you have corporate decisions, executives ruining all sorts of things by
1466952	1469353	just mismanaging everything.
1469353	1480436	There's no accountability for these upper management because they make these decisions to close these studios and then they get like millions and millions of dollar bonuses from doing all of this.
1480436	1483617	And it's just it doesn't matter how badly they mismanage it.
1483617	1485218	They get so much money from it.
1485218	1486238	You look at Bobby Kotick.
1486238	1487239	I mean, perfect example.
1489758	1491120	I don't know.
1491120	1498292	One of the things too, Matt Booty also explained that, you know, basically Xbox and Bethesda studios have been spread too thin.
1498292	1500797	He called it like peanut butter on bread.
1502608	1507171	I don't think peanut butter spread on bread is very thin, but whatever.
1507171	1511233	That the team leaders felt understaffed.
1511233	1519718	It's hard to support nine studios across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do.
1519718	1521559	And I think we're about to topple over.
1521559	1523380	Stop buying studios then.
1523380	1523840	Yeah, that...
1525481	1527203	That is purely a commentary.
1527203	1534372	That's a shooting yourself in the foot comment because that's purely a commentary on the management and the executive level decisions that are going into that.
1534372	1535413	That's that.
1535413	1537015	How does that happen?
1537015	1539338	That's that's a fault of management.
1539338	1539959	The only
1540800	1553528	In that whole thing you were explaining, the only thing that makes sense is the move of the studio that got absorbed into doing Elder Scrolls Online type of work, because that's reallocating the resources, right?
1553528	1555490	That's why that one doesn't feel as painful.
1555490	1561053	I mean, I'm sure it's and I'm sorry to folks that work at that studio that may be listening.
1561053	1568318	But you know, you sort of feel a little more like, okay, well, at least those folks are still working and the resources are being allocated where it makes sense.
1568818	1573841	And so it kind of sucks that that isn't happening at a higher level at Microsoft.
1573841	1584107	And it really sucks that the board and the CEO above above make these decisions and none of them are ever liable.
1584107	1587909	Which is why I wouldn't be sad to see Phil Spencer leave after this.
1588769	1590750	However, I don't think that's going to happen.
1590750	1595394	I actually, I, I, I'm not sure he's completely to blame.
1595394	1596274	He's a little bit to blame.
1596274	1601337	Some of this mismanagement is certainly on him, but I don't think he's as much to blame as those above him.
1601337	1606761	So who signed off on the ABK acquisition in the first place?
1606761	1612005	It, it just shows you like, here's the thing is like, I think to take it even more basic than that, it's like,
1612708	1613208	Thanks for watching!
1626605	1631589	Um, I want to play the Sarah Bond quote from it because SSA 100 Matt actually found it.
1631589	1634351	I apologize my co host because the way things are wired, you guys can't hear this.
1634351	1637853	But I do want to play this here just so those that haven't heard it can hear it.
1637853	1639274	Because she really does.
1639274	1643818	This is really word salad here and but but kind of listen to it.
1643818	1646560	Listen to it out now that we've talked about this.
1646560	1649362	If you haven't taken a second to digest this.
1649362	1653705	Now listen to this and listen to her comments in the context of
1654873	1659534	I'm having to speak for a decision that I had no say in.
1659534	1666316	Even though I'm the president of Xbox, I am now going to speak for a decision I had no hand in.
1666316	1667637	Okay, I'm going to play this clip.
1667637	1667977	Here we go.
1667977	1672698	This is from a Bloomberg interview that's been circling around Twitter and it's on YouTube as well.
1673407	1677531	One of the things I really love about the games industry is it's a creative art form.
1698410	1705773	And it means that the situation and what success is for each game and studio is also really unique.
1705773	1710976	Like, there's no one size fits all to it for us.
1710976	1723162	And so we look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with sort of making decisions and trade-offs like that.
1724305	1736717	But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the services, and ensuring that we're setting ourselves up to be able to deliver on those promises.
1738294	1741938	I'm sorry, you can see it in her face.
1741938	1744039	This is painful for her.
1744039	1748263	I'm trying not to read into it too much, but I can see it on her face.
1748263	1749605	This is painful.
1749605	1752828	It's not something she really wanted to talk about, but too bad.
1752828	1754990	That's what you're getting paid to do, right?
1754990	1756251	That's the whole thing.
1756251	1759034	And this answer that she gives about the whole, well,
1760595	1765457	each studio kind of has its different measures that it's held to.
1765457	1769199	And all of it is to ensure the long term success.
1769199	1781164	I mean, like, when you kind of listen to it at that highest level, it like it even just comes through more that it's like, yeah, each studio was really measured at its own sort of level.
1781164	1785866	And if it was, well, it's going to take us four years or five years to make a hi fi rush to
1786426	1801211	or an Evil Within 3 or whatever it is we're working on, then you know what, sorry, it's not worth the investment because the second half of what she says, we have to invest in the long-term projects and the long-term future and all of that as well.
1801211	1810774	And yeah, many folks in chat are calling out how then the producers over at Bloomberg then frame it with this shot in the background.
1810774	1815115	And for those in the podcast, there's a shot of Microsoft's Xbox
1815675	1822639	year over year growth and you see a lot of painful years and then you see it just take off.
1822639	1824460	It's really hard to read the labels.
1824460	1827762	I'm going to assume that's 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, or maybe, you know, some type of financial year.
1827762	1827822	But
1833803	1839367	I will also say this in fairness of the graph, as much as it's easy to point and go, this is awkward.
1839367	1851317	Well, keep in mind, the Xbox one and that entire era was a pain point for Microsoft that they've corrected with game pass and all this other stuff.
1851317	1851517	Yeah.
1851517	1853398	And E3VL says it's declining at the end.
1853398	1853618	Yeah.
1853618	1861324	Because everything took off during COVID and all of that time, you know, and this is, this is the industry kind of, you know, this is a problem in the industry as a whole.
1861324	1861745	In fact,
1863215	1865345	Another thing I was kind of thinking about with all of this
1866790	1874056	I really feel like, you know, we're coming up on about 41 years since one of the biggest things that has ever happened in the video game industry.
1874056	1885125	And that was the video game crash of, I usually say 1984, but many people would say it actually started around 83 and didn't really end until the NES came out in America in 85.
1885125	1889108	But there was this whole video game crash of 83, 84.
1889108	1892430	And in some ways, I really feel like what we're going through now,
1893291	1894773	is another video game crash.
1894773	1896555	It's a different kind.
1896555	1900660	It's it's not the exact you know, I like a lot of people are gonna be quick to correct me.
1900660	1906888	Well, the original video game crash was about you know, the the influx of cartridges or retail spaces that well,
1907785	1934842	hold on there's there's some common themes actually going on here and that is that whole retail space and what that all looks like is changing as we see that Target and all these stores are starting to get rid of the shelf space for video games which is weird because it's like what the industry kind of wants in a way but you know that's all leading to this whole thing and just you know again the the industry having these huge expectations and
1936770	1938132	I just thought of it.
1938132	1947502	Instead of everybody wants their own Atari cartridge, everybody wants their own cartridge, everybody wants to make their own thing, everybody wants to make their own live service game.
1949551	1950671	That's what it is.
1950671	1953252	That's the video game crash of 2024.
1953252	1956293	Everybody thinks they can make their own instead of an Atari cartridge.
1956293	1965895	It's they're making their startup to do their own battle pass, to do their own live service game, to do their own free to play mobile title, to do their own way on how this is going to work.
1965895	1972377	And it is all coming to this head that a lot of that is very expensive to make, and it's all falling apart.
1973925	1986774	And so yeah, again, it's not a one for one, but there are so many similarities that I really think what we're looking at right now is that video game crash that many people have been saying has been coming for a long time now.
1986774	1987375	It's happening.
1988450	1992713	Now, is it going to affect the consumer in the same way?
1992713	1999719	Because you know, again, indies, self publishing, that's always still going to kind of be a thing that is always there in the back of the industry.
1999719	2001821	It's not like video games are going to go away or anything like that.
2001821	2012890	But I really think you know, when it comes to what we're looking at right here, the closure of these big studios and the removal of these big titles.
2012890	2016392	Yeah, there is some commonality there.
2016392	2016693	I don't know.
2017788	2025818	Just something I was thinking about with all this and just the layoffs on layoffs on layoffs.
2025818	2031606	This industry is changing, and it's hard to feel like it's for the better.
2034028	2039171	I was going to mention some additional things regarding Arcane.
2039171	2043753	So, you know, they were obviously still working on Redfall during this whole time.
2043753	2050397	So along with that, you know, there was the Battle Pass and all that stuff.
2050397	2056580	DLC that was promised to the players of Redfall that is not coming out anymore.
2057344	2059886	So they're they're not going to continue development on it.
2059886	2066992	So now, of course, Xbox is going, well, the servers are going to remain online for players to enjoy.
2066992	2074318	And then we will make we'll provide make good offers to players who purchase the Hero DLC.
2074318	2078961	Also, they were working on offline mode because the game was online only.
2078961	2081744	That is not going to happen anymore.
2081744	2085487	And that mode was almost done.
2085487	2085647	Yeah.
2086303	2114734	and then of course we have HiFiRush was supposed to come out on the switch at some point it's been kind of teased for a long time well don't expect that one because there's no one left to make it and and hit the publish button or whatever you want to call it so it's it's it also kind of feels like dang like when they turn it off they turn it off when they make a move they make them like almost like you know inconsequential of anything else
2115740	2117823	Comments in chat?
2131602	2135005	SGO100 Matt says entertainment sector in general is leaning towards this.
2135005	2142610	Marvel Studios even said that they're going to cut down on MCU movies and shows to maybe two a year rather than several.
2142610	2152738	Well, talk about an area that feels like spread thin peanut butter or whatever the hell that analogy was like that I would absolutely applies in the Marvel Universe as well.
2154171	2161196	SheHulk10 in chat says, I really enjoyed Redfall and I predict it will be considered a must play classic game and one of the best games ever made someday.
2161196	2162496	That's quite a statement.
2162496	2165158	But I do know that Redfall has its fans.
2165158	2174724	And I will say this, that single player thing, probably the only... I don't see a negative coming out of the single player thing.
2174724	2177986	It would have served to bring in new fans, if nothing else.
2177986	2181128	And the fact that that isn't going to happen, it sucks.
2183762	2211462	I wonder if modders don't figure this out or so I wonder if something doesn't happen where there's I mean it might be a little I know with server and you'd really be talking about the games code I realize it's it's maybe maybe maybe someday well here's the thing here's the thing okay so this this is something that sometimes happens game studios close assets are sold off dev code that's unfinished magically gets out there somehow
2212844	2218047	And then the codes found later on and all sorts of things come out.
2218047	2224411	And it's not to say there'll never be a HiFiRush 2, because Microsoft now owns the IP.
2224411	2227072	And maybe maybe Blizzard makes a HiFiRush 2.
2227072	2227532	They won't.
2227532	2229914	But you know, maybe another studio makes a HiFiRush 2.
2229914	2232075	And again, I wouldn't get my hopes up.
2232075	2237078	And it may not look the same or, you know, really be what you're hoping for.
2237078	2237318	But
2240336	2243607	They do own the name at this point, and that's about all they own.
2247554	2250715	This is just this has just been a hard thing to watch for the industry as a whole.
2250715	2252815	It's one of those when it when is this going to end?
2252815	2254535	When when when?
2254535	2257376	I will say though, you know, what's interesting in this whole thing?
2257376	2260356	I'm sorry, I'm going to bring I brought this up before, but I have to bring it up again.
2260356	2262997	Because you know, what's interesting in this whole thing.
2262997	2266477	We have watched these studios, layoffs, all this stuff.
2266477	2273359	And you know, who seems to be in their own fucking bubble, doing their own thing and immune to all this once again, Nintendo.
2273359	2275199	And this is one of those weird things.
2276124	2282852	where I feel like Nintendo purposefully being behind the curve on tech has actually really paid off for them.
2282852	2283372	Think about it.
2283372	2285635	Nintendo games don't have battle passes.
2285635	2288298	Nintendo games don't do any of that stuff.
2288298	2289419	And here they are sitting fine.
2292148	2292708	I don't know.
2292708	2293969	Just interesting.
2293969	2294249	For now.
2294249	2295710	I hope I didn't season passes.
2295710	2298471	I hope I didn't just damn them with that comment.
2298471	2299171	Kinda.
2299171	2299591	Yeah, they have.
2299591	2301252	But it's just DLC.
2301252	2306354	And Nintendo has a pretty good reputation of having pretty decent DLC.
2306354	2309356	Maybe the exception of Splatoon three.
2309356	2311737	And I think that's where you're starting to see it slip a little bit.
2311737	2316179	But they also happen to have more responsible management.
2316179	2318140	I Yes, yes.
2321964	2335632	There's been a precedent set already, rest in peace Iwata, but that was the example I think that others in the company sort of strive to follow, at least that's the feeling that I have.
2336973	2346203	And again, I think it may be just a very Japanese thing to put the interest of the company above your own interests.
2346203	2348206	What's best for longevity?
2348206	2351709	What's best for everybody there instead of what's going to line my pocket?
2354815	2363123	Anyway, I hope this is the last we have to report on studio closures this year, but I fear it won't be.
2363123	2365885	But we have no choice but to move on.
2365885	2372371	It's just very hard to be a video game enthusiast when all the enthusiasm is getting sucked out of the room.
2372371	2373392	That's why I play old shit.
2374291	2375373	I don't blame you.
2375373	2380738	And DJ Ranma S also brings up an interesting perspective that really plays into this whole situation.
2380738	2382940	DJ Ranma S says, Rob, that's the answer.
2382940	2385162	Nintendo is a gaming company.
2385162	2387224	Microsoft is a tech company.
2387224	2389286	Sony is a multimedia company.
2389286	2390027	There's your difference.
2391260	2394282	Well, also Nintendo makes cards.
2394282	2398624	Well, you know, they have a pretty big arm on the retail front, too.
2398624	2402806	But just, you know, yes, that goes back to the gaming.
2402806	2404667	Yes.
2404667	2411690	What you're seeing happen to Microsoft this week was the tech arm of the company making changes in the gaming arm.
2411690	2412911	That's what happened.
2412911	2414552	I think succinctly, yes.
2414552	2415772	Why is this happen to Microsoft?
2415772	2417493	Why doesn't it happen at Nintendo?
2417493	2419014	I think that's a very succinct way of putting it.
2419014	2419174	Yes.
2420575	2426423	Alright, anyway, let's talk about the games that do bring us joy and do make us enthusiastic as we talk about our gaming weeks.
2426423	2427885	How was your gaming week?
2427885	2430689	DarkSakura, I know you had mentioned some big things in your week.
2430689	2431310	How was your gaming week?
2432017	2433998	Busier than usual.
2433998	2439560	I spent a lot of time trying to figure out different games to play.
2439560	2444743	I did beat Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight last night.
2444743	2449765	I will continue to call it by its Japanese name since I was playing the Japanese version.
2449765	2459409	This was the Sega Saturn one, but translated to English with the PSP dialogue and most of the dialogue voices, although all the background voices were still the same.
2462687	2464550	And I love that game.
2464550	2466393	It's such a fun game.
2466393	2474407	And basically, once I had the walk armor and my Yata Tuna, which took forever to get, I beat the game.
2474407	2475409	So I was happy with it.
2476132	2480314	I got my happy ending with Maria chasing after Alucard.
2480314	2483235	Spoilers for a bajillion years old game.
2483235	2487877	Also played Dead by Daylight, because of course I did.
2487877	2490619	Also played Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.
2490619	2497662	I am waiting for whatever the season pass stuff to kick in.
2497662	2499803	They said summer, so maybe.
2499803	2503665	But I'm finishing up all of the quests I have left to do.
2505306	2508751	And then I busted out more of the classics.
2508751	2519426	So I played Vulfied for PC Engine, aka TurboGrafx-16, which is the successor to Kix.
2521267	2524430	and I screamed at it a lot last night.
2524430	2530075	Played a little Knuckles Chaotix, just enough to remember why I don't play Knuckles Chaotix.
2530075	2535059	I played X-Men Children of the Atom for Saturn, you know, the fighting game.
2535059	2538042	I kind of have lost my ability to play that game.
2538042	2541745	I played another fighting game called Rabbit for the Saturn.
2541745	2544047	It's really pretty.
2544047	2546750	I played a bunch of Luminesce today for PSP.
2549352	2550253	I love that game.
2550253	2552034	I love the music in it.
2552034	2558719	But I think I might move on to Luminesce 2, just because I like the music in that better.
2558719	2563963	I played Galactic Pinball for Virtual Boy, and that's enough to realize why I do not play anything on the Virtual Boy.
2566264	2573787	I played Summer Carnival 92, Elzotic, for the PC Engine.
2573787	2581310	It's another one of those, like Wrecka was, the summer carnival games, the little shooting game that was timed, and I had fun with it.
2581830	2587671	And I play a bunch of Star Parodia, also for PC Engine CD.
2587671	2589271	Super CD-ROM!
2589271	2606935	Of course I played as the PC Engine, and I love the power-ups in that game, because, like, when you get a shield, it's little PC Engine controllers, and one of your secondary weapons is shooting out a bunch of CDs, and you collect two cards for your power-ups.
2609682	2613925	I also started playing something that I immediately now regret starting to play.
2613925	2619789	I started playing that RuPaul game on my iPhone.
2619789	2620510	Help.
2620510	2622131	I didn't even know there was a RuPaul game.
2622131	2626153	That game wants you to watch a bajillion ads and spend all of your money.
2626153	2630416	And I'm kind of sick at it, but it's also a good waste of time.
2630416	2637001	I'm still playing wordscapes because, you know, I like making my brain do things.
2637001	2638502	And that's it.
2638502	2638782	All right.
2639434	2640735	I played a bunch.
2640735	2643076	Yeah, you had a very busy week, busier than mine.
2643076	2643736	We'll go to Loki.
2643736	2645657	How was your gaming week?
2645657	2648679	Well, this week, I actually played different things.
2648679	2649859	Oh, my goodness.
2649859	2650299	What?
2650299	2651980	I know it's nuts.
2651980	2653981	Who are you and what have you done with Loki?
2653981	2656102	Sorry, I've been trying to like play other things.
2656102	2660845	Actually, you know, funny enough, my my son wanted me to set up Steam family sharing.
2660845	2663766	So now he has access to like 900 games.
2663766	2665007	So, you know,
2667348	2670690	But anyways, yeah, I played, of course, Little Kitty, Big City.
2670690	2674612	So I almost 100% of that played that for like a few hours the other day.
2674612	2675833	I've been like extremely tired.
2675833	2689061	So because of this, whatever this virus is I have now, it's like kind of like a bronchitis, pneumonia thing, but thankfully don't have pneumonia, but still annoying.
2689061	2691483	And so it's just like really like
2692660	2695041	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2709669	2716054	So I don't know what it is, but it's some sort of virus that causes like a bacterial infection and stuff and it's not fun.
2716054	2721018	But anyways, so I was playing, yeah, Loki, Big City.
2721018	2724861	I picked up, I haven't played it yet, but I picked up that new...
2727088	2729469	and gosh, I don't remember what it's called now.
2729469	2730750	Never mind.
2730750	2736213	There's the new Big Mode game, their first publishing game, Animal Well or something like that.
2736213	2738334	I think that's maybe what it's called.
2738334	2745417	And of course, going back to my recent favorite game so far this year is, of course, Turbo Kid.
2745417	2747899	Been playing more of that.
2747899	2756303	Really great Metroidvania game and just working more on the Minecraft stuff, doing a lot of aimless things in game just to try to
2757321	2759984	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2777384	2783175	I downloaded the mod to downgrade Fallout and I was like, ah, that looks like a lot of work.
2783175	2785299	I'm gonna go play the cat games.
2785299	2787844	So I didn't play Fallout 4, unfortunately.
2789773	2806299	Alright, well my gaming week, I had a pretty busy week with work, was doing some traveling and stuff, so not a lot of gaming time, but I did play Diablo 4, as I have been, but big breaking news, I finished the Battle Pass.
2806299	2811501	I was working so hard on, because there is a big patch coming on Tuesday.
2811921	2812462	BATTLE PASS REWORK
2837799	2840261	I finished the battle pass that felt good.
2840261	2855470	And then otherwise I've been playing mostly and DarkSakura I wonder if you know that this is a thing because I remember this was a when you love this game the most but World of Warcraft classic got its cataclysm pre patch this last week.
2856070	2885410	So I have been playing I started a worgen to experience that whole storyline again and I've been playing what's essentially cataclysm I think the only thing like I think it's still walled off you can't go from 80 to 85 yet but you know you can do the whole like all the you know how like the world changed all that all of that is in place and all the quality of life stuff more importantly is there and it's interesting to see some of the quality of life things they kept from modern wow just a few but like the transmogrifier and all that stuff and the
2886831	2892034	the way that you have just a library of all the gear you've accumulated through time that you can transport.
2892034	2895676	That's all in the game, which I don't think was there at least during the first.
2895676	2898398	I think transmogrifier became a thing that came out.
2898398	2899719	It didn't work later.
2899719	2901520	Yeah, it came out later, but it didn't work the same way.
2901520	2904142	Did it come out around Pandaria?
2904142	2905323	You might be right.
2905323	2906224	That might be right.
2906224	2912748	I think the book was even during I think that was during like the like Warlords of Draenor, the expansion after, honestly.
2912748	2915430	But anyway, I didn't play Warlords or
2916984	2918345	I went right on to Legion after that.
2932096	2935277	Well, I keep playing it for weeks and weeks, probably not.
2935277	2937738	I'll start the new Diablo 4 season for sure.
2937738	2939919	It's like, let's do it all over again.
2939919	2943140	But also, Final Fantasy XIV is getting a huge patch.
2943140	2953885	Well, not a huge patch, but an event, the Moogletome event, which is what I will finish leveling everything to 90, because we're like six weeks away from the Final Fantasy XIV expansion.
2953885	2955606	So I'm all about that when that comes out.
2957237	2960399	Bobby Blackwolf says, are you going to pay for the battle pass?
2960399	2968983	I'm going to really try to hold off this time and make sure I get far enough through it and I enjoy the season enough that it's worth it.
2968983	2973405	Because when all said and done, season three was the weakest season.
2973405	2975906	Season one and two were better.
2975906	2977567	But to Blizzard's credit,
2978007	2985031	They really do listen to player feedback because the dumbest thing about season 3 was the whole trap dungeons and all of that.
2985031	2993535	And they made a patch pretty quickly into the season that really nerfed how many hits you could take in a trap dungeon and still get the reward.
2993535	3000039	Like they made it like 10 times as many hits and they just made it so much better through what they were doing.
3001339	3002480	It became a little more bearable.
3002480	3007143	But I think the only reason I really liked season three was it was my first time playing a barbarian.
3007143	3010726	And honestly, barbarians probably my favorite class in Diablo four so far.
3010726	3015910	And that even surprised me, but they are so much fun and really satisfying with the moveset.
3015910	3021274	So next season, I'm going to play a mage, because it's the one so in
3022074	3025437	Regular Diablo 4 before there were Battle Passes, I played a Druid.
3025437	3027358	Season 1, I did a Necromancer.
3027358	3029059	Season 2, I did a Hunter.
3029059	3030440	Season 3, I did a Barbarian.
3030440	3034003	So the only class I have left is Mage, Wizard, whatever you want to call it.
3034003	3036425	So that's what I'm going to play this next season.
3036425	3037726	So.
3037726	3040048	I gave you a little incentive, Rob.
3040048	3041369	Bring back Sassy Pants.
3041369	3047814	That was my World of Warcraft character, my OG, the original World of Warcraft character was Sassy Pants.
3048519	3052501	No, my current World of Warcraft character, you know, all the good names are taken.
3052501	3053121	It's hard.
3053121	3059864	So I started to name, you know, I like to name after cute things, sugary things, which is ironic, I know.
3059864	3061285	Breakfast cereals, things like that.
3061285	3065667	So the name of my character is Donets, my hostess.
3065667	3067828	You know what, Rob, if I started playing it,
3068513	3075676	We would have because remember when we were going around with like our like complementary characters?
3075676	3076256	Yes.
3076256	3077317	For a while.
3077317	3080358	We need to make Trixie and Katya.
3080358	3081699	I'm sure those names are taken.
3081699	3083439	We'd have to misspell them, but that would be.
3083439	3084120	Well, screw that.
3084120	3086161	We're the best.
3086161	3088602	I love it.
3088602	3091763	I mean, I still have Rebecca Black, though.
3091763	3092663	I love that character.
3092663	3093824	That was that was fun.
3094444	3095444	I have the best memory.
3117370	3120594	doing things with friends and having vacation time.
3120594	3123477	So we'll bring me back to my lord.
3123477	3126360	I just it'll be in my belly.
3126360	3129103	No, I'll bring I like my lord.
3129103	3129904	I'm that weirdo.
3129904	3132547	That's like this isn't as bad as you want to make it out to be.
3132547	3132767	Yeah.
3133007	3136188	I want to try it and and and those amazing chocolates.
3136188	3141271	Well, I'll actually say I don't know how much I but I am going out for an Ingress event as well.
3141271	3146093	Like it's kind of a combo thing, because I can see my friends, Ingress is like a big thing.
3146093	3152356	But the Ingress after party, we were able to pre buy shots of Malort.
3152356	3154717	And you can actually get them out of a toilet bowl.
3155586	3156046	What?
3156046	3161409	So I ordered a shot of Malort in a toilet bowl that I will be doing.
3161409	3162970	The little miniature ones.
3162970	3163930	Loki, I see you making faces.
3163930	3169393	I'm going to go look up a toilet bowl of shot glasses.
3169393	3174136	Bobby Black Woman Chat says, Then again, you like Beverly, so I can see why you like Malort.
3174136	3175937	All I have to say is I exist.
3175937	3179218	I'm not bothered by Jägermeister either, which most people are like.
3181125	3184287	You know, no, Jägermeister is disgusting.
3184287	3186507	It's, it's, it's licorice.
3186507	3190909	It's dirt.
3190909	3193931	God, even your Vtuber made a face.
3193931	3196112	See?
3200410	3203852	I need to screen cap that because that should be your new little icon.
3203852	3205213	All right.
3205213	3206974	Anyway, let's move on.
3206974	3210517	Let's talk about what else is going on in games, because there's a little bit this way.
3210517	3211317	I did it for you.
3211317	3211978	Thank you.
3211978	3212238	All right.
3212238	3214519	We'll go to Loki.
3214519	3219042	Well, it's a story about EA, so that's got to be a good story, right?
3219042	3219843	Positive.
3219843	3222705	You know, we just came off of all these different.
3222705	3225927	Are they releasing a new pinball construction set?
3225927	3227748	Uh, no.
3227748	3229710	No, they're they're adding ads to games.
3230430	3237515	because, you know, that's what we want, you know, more money for EA.
3237515	3253126	So EA CEO Andrew Wilson said on a May 7th earnings call that he where he was asked about the dynamic ad insertion within AAA games and if he thought it was possible or a possible source of cash flow for the company.
3253666	3263872	Wilson said EA sees advertising as a possible meaningful driver of growth, but wants it to be thoughtful about how ads could be implemented into its games.
3266915	3292742	I don't think he really wants, he's probably not thinking too much about how thoughtful ads could be inserted in the games and I assert, considering how many ads we already have in EA titles as it is when we're talking about sports because it's realistic to the sports broadcast, I honestly could see them just inserting this wherever they can to make as much money as they can considering that they're selling these games for $70
3294382	3299043	on top of all the other things that they're selling with these games.
3299043	3299524	I don't know.
3299524	3305825	For me, I don't buy EA games because it's sports or Star Wars at this point.
3305825	3308226	I mean, there hasn't been a battlefield in a while.
3308226	3315808	And yep, I don't really care to play those right now.
3315808	3316488	I don't know.
3316488	3319109	It's not surprising.
3320731	3331395	You know, and the whole thing that just feels like a kick in the crotch with all of this is that, you know, again, it's not like these games aren't going to continue to be $70 and now they're shoving ads into it as well.
3331395	3343260	It's like, you know, it's like when your Amazon Prime plan that you are watching TV shows and movies ad free on suddenly gets ads into them, but the cost didn't go down at all.
3343260	3344521	They are treating
3345601	3347883	Triple A games like mobile get titles.
3347883	3350786	They are they're basically going.
3350786	3355290	See, because the way it is, is we had 2020 with the pandemic.
3355290	3357912	All of all these companies profits went up.
3357912	3361736	And the problem with these companies is they're always trying to have infinite growth.
3362336	3363878	And you just cannot do that.
3363878	3369343	They're not satisfied with, hey, we're a company that makes $20 billion in revenue or something like that.
3369343	3370744	And that's good enough.
3370744	3373306	You know, we can sustain ourselves.
3373306	3375949	We're always going to make that 20 billion each year.
3375949	3376829	Cool.
3376829	3379592	No, no, they need to make more and more each year.
3379592	3380553	The problem is
3381348	3390332	there are a finite number of, well, hours in the day, finite numbers of players, and those players have finite amount of money.
3390332	3396435	And so you can't just keep, you can't keep making more profit.
3396435	3404579	I mean, they're already super profitable as is, and they're doing lots of things to just, basically, it's just all for the shareholders.
3404579	3408841	Well, and I, yeah, I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but
3410066	3438125	I don't mean to sound like a broken record but the thing is the only company again that I've ever heard the phrase cash on hand used with is Nintendo that they were able to absorb the floppage of the Wii U because they banked some of that money they made with the Wii and they set it aside in case they ever had a flop someday again I just the only company in gaming I ever seem to hear that phrase cash on hand with
3439551	3440553	Just interesting, that's all.
3451790	3455291	well received because they were very intrusive.
3455291	3463233	For example, you may remember Capcom had some advertising in Street Fighter five, I believe five.
3463233	3464794	Yeah.
3464794	3470275	Street Fighter five, where they inserted all sorts of like logos on the players in the arena.
3470275	3472496	Like it was ridiculous.
3472496	3476397	This match sponsored by Bud Light or whatever it is.
3476397	3478918	There were ads for the boys in UFC four.
3481208	3485431	But once again, you know, there was, you know, backlash to that.
3485431	3490314	I mean, you have a lot of these companies trying to sell advertising.
3490314	3494717	Dark to Sia in chat says, Yeah, Street Fighter V was a mess from what I understand.
3494717	3497458	Well, it was an odd number Street Fighter game.
3497458	3500640	Cue DarkSakura defending three.
3500640	3501321	Um, no.
3502173	3503574	Okay.
3503574	3507215	Oh, I thought you'd have something nice to say about three.
3507215	3514219	Um, uh, it didn't have Sakura, so why would I say something nice about it?
3514219	3517640	They had very fluid movements.
3517640	3518020	It's very nice.
3518020	3523863	Even like, was it even, you know, Death Stranding had a Mountain Dew in it.
3523863	3525764	I mean, it's just it.
3526687	3530448	There's a lot of like product placement and stuff in these.
3530448	3532309	Oh, Cup Noodle and Final Fantasy XV.
3532309	3533109	That was the best.
3533109	3534169	Yeah.
3534169	3534689	Yeah.
3534689	3537070	I mean.
3537070	3539770	I don't know, it's just it.
3539770	3541171	You just have to vote with your wallet.
3541171	3547573	And unfortunately, with EA, there's a lot of diehard sports fans that will literally buy anything that they put out.
3547573	3552814	They are kind of in like that cult likes, you know, cycle with them where
3553988	3560597	I mean, there will be a breaking point at some point, but a lot of people... There are gamers that only game for Madden.
3560597	3563101	There are gamers that only game for Madden.
3563101	3566145	And that's, we have to accept that and that they are gamers too.
3568103	3578576	Well, and that's what that's what monopolies get you, because if you had multiple sports games out there, not to say that 2K would do any better, because they certainly aren't.
3578576	3584404	If you had other sports games out there that were competing with each other, like multiple NFL games,
3585419	3591084	If a company decides not to do that, that game could be possibly more popular.
3591084	3592585	Fuck the NFL.
3592585	3593626	No, fuck the NFL.
3593626	3594206	Quote me.
3594206	3595227	Fuck the NFL.
3595227	3597569	Have Nintendo put out another super high impact.
3597569	3598890	You don't need the NFL.
3598890	3603614	Just put out something really fucking clever that goes around it.
3603614	3605676	Mario football.
3605676	3607418	Is it Mario football?
3607418	3607798	Exactly.
3610819	3611739	All right.
3611739	3616161	Well, speaking of Nintendo, how would you all like to get an announcement of an announcement?
3616161	3618882	Because that's what we got this week.
3618882	3622603	That is what Nintendo said about the Nintendo Switch 2.
3622603	3631566	Finally, responding sort of to some of the many rumors out there, Nintendo President Shintaro Furukawa has officially confirmed via
3633668	3641498	The world's favorite press release website, Twitter, saying that the Nintendo Switch successor will be announced within this fiscal year.
3641498	3644261	So that runs until March 2025.
3644261	3650548	In a tweet from Nintendo Co Ltd, which is not a parody account, it is the official Nintendo company Twitter,
3651970	3654752	This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo.
3654752	3659816	We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year.
3659816	3664440	It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015.
3664440	3664740	Nine years.
3664740	3664800	Wow.
3670458	3684494	We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.
3684494	3688879	You know what I like that he's doing is setting the fucking expectations reasonably.
3689420	3693422	So he's basically saying, we're gonna do an E3 Memorial Direct.
3693422	3702505	Okay, so like Microsoft, who is also doing an E3 Memorial Direct, we're gonna do an E3 Memorial Direct in June, because that's what y'all are used to.
3702505	3704326	So why rock the boat?
3704326	3713770	But he says, do not, do not, don't expect that there's going to be a lick of information about the Nintendo Switch 2.
3713770	3715311	We will announce it later.
3716192	3721314	So what you're saying is I should expect a Switch 2 announcement.
3721314	3722974	They just want to keep me on my toes.
3722974	3724474	Cue the podcasts.
3724474	3726475	Cue the three hour YouTubes.
3726475	3727175	Cue it all.
3727175	3727595	It's Nintendo.
3727595	3729636	They do what they want.
3729636	3736538	Reading into what Furukawa is saying about the Nintendo Switch 2 and what we might see in June.
3736538	3738118	Switch 2 is coming out in June.
3738118	3738999	Got it.
3738999	3739719	That's what I heard.
3744941	3754947	Anyway, so for the rest of you that are reasonable out there, now you know that in June they will be announcing basically what the ramp down for the Switch looks like.
3754947	3758329	And you know, is there going to be a big holiday title?
3758329	3761691	Does Metroid Prime 4 make it for this holiday?
3761691	3765293	Or is there another thing Nintendo's cooking?
3765293	3767834	What other Wii U ports might they make?
3767834	3769515	Do we get Xenoblade Chronicles X?
3769515	3772056	Do we finally just finish it off and get that one too?
3772056	3773317	Like, what else is coming?
3774878	3780214	We will find all that out in June, what the ramp down looks like, and then we'll get the new console.
3782196	3785477	SSU 100 Matt says Nintendo is trying to control the narrative.
3785477	3792820	They're tired of their stock taking hints and trending negatively after every direct because the switch to wasn't announced.
3792820	3795741	Yeah, so he's he's gonna let the stock take a hit now.
3795741	3798642	We are not bringing up the switch to it will spoiler alert.
3798642	3804784	It'll take a hit anyway, because investors are dumb.
3804784	3806344	It's it's gonna.
3806344	3808325	Yeah, it's it's gonna take a hit anyway.
3808325	3808465	But
3809305	3817469	There was also an interesting kind of Q&A about, aren't you worried about cutting into the sales of the Switch by announcing the Switch 2?
3817469	3821971	And you already know the answer is, nah.
3821971	3826073	The Switch is strong enough that we're going to be, and we have cash on hand.
3826073	3827753	He just said that it's nine years old.
3827753	3830795	I mean, like, they'll just discount it.
3830795	3832795	Yeah, or possibly come out with another.
3832795	3835777	Wait, Nintendo and discount in the same sentence?
3835777	3836057	Mm hmm.
3837216	3864347	I mean, that would be a hell of a way to go with the switch a closeout sale stock up on that because Oh, the other thing that is interesting about Nintendo switch to that they did confirm is that Nintendo switch to will have physical media which we kind of knew but it is nice to sort of have that confirmed that portability still means you can have a cartridge for it.
3864347	3864467	So
3865885	3866805	All right.
3866805	3871186	Anyway, let's move on and talk about some other headlines.
3871186	3875107	DarkSakura, a gaming arena near and dear to your heart.
3875107	3876788	Two of them, actually.
3876788	3877368	Oh, yeah.
3877368	3877768	Oh, yeah.
3877768	3878808	I'm excited.
3878808	3882109	I forgot to add it on myself, and I'm glad that you did.
3882109	3883830	I sort of thought of you.
3883830	3889111	These are two things that I love is Dead by Daylight and Dungeons and Dragons.
3889111	3891472	Although I am second edition for life.
3892591	3894071	do not step to me.
3894071	3897452	Your lack of THAC0 is wacko.
3897452	3899913	Yeah.
3899913	3900293	Yeah.
3900293	3900913	What Rob said.
3900913	3903114	I'm going to, I'm going to make that on a shirt, Rob.
3903114	3903574	Okay.
3903574	3906315	Hey, you're talking about opening up the OLR shop again.
3906315	3906755	There you go.
3906755	3909016	Your lack of THAC0 is wacko.
3909016	3910016	Copyright Rob Roberts.
3911323	3919749	Anyway, the next chapter for Dead by Daylight is going to be a D&D-themed chapter.
3919749	3924131	And I believe this one is going to have definitely a new killer.
3924131	3925552	I don't know about a new survivor.
3925552	3927754	I have to double-check the roadmap again.
3927754	3931276	But there is going to be on Tuesday.
3931276	3932217	I think it's on Tuesday?
3932217	3933918	Yeah, it is on Tuesday.
3934733	3937415	Yeah, a live conversation.
3937415	3942758	And this happens every year because we're coming up on the 8th anniversary.
3942758	3946380	Where they go over the state of the game and gonna be talking about that.
3946380	3951724	And the PTB goes live that day, the public test build.
3951724	3957788	So we'll find out more about it, although a lot of people are already speculating that it's going to be legit Vecna.
3958669	3959269	Trailer?
3959269	3962232	Does that look like a beholder?
3967819	3969601	Yeah, it looked like a Beholder to me.
3969601	3980731	I mean, it didn't seem like as bodily spherical as I expect a Beholder to be, but I also don't know how a Beholder would work as an enemy in Dead by Daylight.
3980731	3987097	I mean, maybe like Sadako with telekinetically lifting people.
3987097	3988278	I mean, we have Chucky.
3989188	3999375	But that was solved by having, you know, the ghost do all the activity for Chucky when it came to picking up and hooking people.
3999375	4000836	But I don't know.
4000836	4002697	I'm pretty happy.
4002697	4010983	And of course, it was released in full behavior fashion where they put it there and then you don't get anything.
4010983	4013245	They just say when you're going to learn more.
4017313	4021614	I'm really hoping that it's as good as I hope it's going to be.
4021614	4023455	You know what I think would be funny?
4023455	4030317	Is that if, um, because you know, they totally want like people to buy cosmetics and shit.
4030317	4038180	I would love it if they release cosmetics for existing survivors based off of certain D&D classes.
4038180	4039820	Oh, that's cute.
4039820	4045002	Yeah, in fact, something I'm gonna do is I wanna- Paladin Dwight, please.
4046485	4048708	Oh, do you think Dwight would really be a paladin, Rob?
4048708	4051470	Precious little paladin Dwight, please.
4051470	4053433	Dwight would not be a fucking paladin.
4053433	4057457	Dwight would be a jester.
4057457	4059539	No, the bard would be Kate.
4059539	4060220	Oh, yeah, fair.
4061113	4064536	Um, Meg would be a flop.
4064536	4065937	I don't know.
4065937	4067478	No, Meg is awesome.
4067478	4068639	You shush.
4068639	4069840	I think.
4069840	4075304	Wait, I was just I just want to say real quick about the the Vecna speculation.
4075304	4076485	It makes a lot of sense.
4076485	4083150	And it's completely in line with and we have seen DBD do this multiple times to get the license they really want.
4083150	4084751	They license it in creative ways.
4085231	4087894	I think Ghostface is the best example of that.
4087894	4093338	Nowhere in DVD is the word scream in the context of the film ever mentioned.
4094042	4095223	DB Ghostface.
4095223	4098065	They even changed the name, his original perk names because of it.
4098065	4098385	Yeah.
4098385	4098925	And yeah.
4098925	4109512	And also, um, the, uh, name that you read the background of the character, it's not any of the killers from scream because what they did, they licensed the same costume that the movie did.
4109512	4114315	Uh, and then Sadako you mentioned that's a license of the book series, not the movie.
4114315	4114855	Nope.
4114855	4115456	Nope.
4115456	4115996	Incorrect.
4115996	4117637	I thought it was the book, the ring of books.
4117637	4118297	Nope.
4118297	4118638	Nope.
4118638	4120299	It's a license of the Japanese movie.
4120299	4120379	Oh,
4120979	4122261	Well, okay, still.
4122261	4126266	And in the books, that's still quite a bit different.
4126266	4126767	Yeah.
4126767	4137741	And a big thing they can't get away with with trying to do licensing for the US one is the fact that the main antagonist in the American version was a young girl.
4138602	4147489	Where Sadako canonically was a 19 year old intersex woman who had worked as an actress, killed everybody.
4147489	4151473	She inherited her mother's psychic abilities and her father locked her in the well and killed her.
4153527	4154468	There you go.
4154468	4157673	I know my Ring fandom very well.
4170612	4174436	We all know the Legion kids were, you know, freaking in high school.
4174436	4176938	The comic even has them as high school kids.
4176938	4181282	So I mean, which the Legion comic is fucking great.
4181282	4182743	But we knew we all knew.
4182743	4187948	And that's what actually makes I think the characters a little bit more sinister than they are.
4187948	4192472	Although the comic really made me feel a lot, a lot sadder for Susie.
4192472	4193753	It'll still going back.
4193753	4194174	Oh, go ahead.
4196068	4204493	It'll still be interesting to see what the door opening with Dungeons & Dragons and really Hasbro in general could lead to in the future for Dead by Daylight.
4204493	4205754	The Monopoly Man.
4205754	4208515	Or the Monopoly Man.
4208515	4214179	I was thinking Magic the Gathering.
4214179	4214879	I don't know.
4214879	4220303	I mean, keep in mind, whenever I think of D&D, I look at its current logo and go, that's not right.
4221232	4224594	You know, I'm my my D&D brain is back in the TSR days.
4224594	4225714	I'm just going to leave it at that.
4225714	4226375	Of course.
4226375	4228996	But but I see a lot.
4228996	4235799	I mean, it would be really funny if they went with cartoon, but I know that that wouldn't play into this.
4235799	4240521	But I would love to see just the Dungeons and Dragons movie.
4240521	4243363	Let's get a what's his name?
4243363	4247045	Yeah, that's really more what I'm thinking it's going to go with.
4247045	4247245	Yeah.
4249337	4261603	I mean, and there are some, like, sort of fantasy cosmetics that are already in the game, like Claudette's and Feng's, like, ranger and botanist outfits and whatnot.
4261603	4265645	And we do have the knight as the killer, so, you know, there's... We do.
4265645	4268626	I'm pretty sure that Claudette would be a druid.
4268626	4269847	I'm just gonna say that now.
4269847	4270927	Yes, Claudette would be a druid.
4270927	4271528	That does make sense.
4272248	4273949	But I have another theory.
4273949	4294165	So this is going back to an announcement they were doing about improvements to the invocation perk where it came with Sable, where she goes in the basement and chants and the more people who join her little magic circle, the faster it goes, which is a rad concept for a perk like summoning demons together.
4294165	4296207	I'm sorry, that's a fucking rad concept for a perk.
4297216	4302962	But it was taking two minutes and they reduced it to one minute then with all the other improvements.
4302962	4308408	What if we get like a mage as a survivor?
4308408	4311351	Like a flat-out fucking mage.
4311351	4312252	As a survivor.
4312252	4314655	I would love the ability to summon a bot.
4316728	4318490	They have an invocation.
4318490	4323313	Like I'm not even saying like summon, you know, a creature or something like that.
4323313	4327997	Now, summoning a bot would be great, but I had another conversation with a friend.
4327997	4343969	I want to say it was in Nick's chat not long ago about having the killer be a mimic and have them fulfill the original idea of Legion that you couldn't tell that it was a survivor.
4345283	4349146	Oh, and that was that was the twist in VHS as well, wasn't it?
4349146	4349706	Kind of.
4349706	4350147	Kind of.
4350147	4350947	Yeah.
4350947	4356852	So what if you have a mimic and, you know, they flat out look like one of the other survivors?
4358055	4359597	You know, you don't.
4359597	4368267	I mean, it would have to be someone who was in the lobby with you and you're screwed if you, you know, came with a shroud or something.
4368267	4373292	But like, you know that they have no terror radius until they start chasing.
4373292	4375895	And that's like their power is just no terror radius.
4375895	4378238	And they turn into a mimic.
4378238	4378819	Could you imagine?
4379130	4393983	Yeah, that'd have to be, like, play along the same lines of, like, you know, Ghostface or Myers, you know, with just that stalky pretend thing.
4393983	4394764	That's my thought.
4394764	4395704	That's what I'd like to see.
4395704	4396905	Copyright, Jamie.
4396905	4397246	All right.
4397246	4405253	Well, we'll get more information on Tuesday, and I'm sure DarkSakura will be probably... No, you can't do PTB still, huh?
4405253	4406514	But you'll be talking about it if not.
4407415	4414998	Yeah, I'm going to watch people... I mean, unless I magically get teleported to PC to do PTB, then no.
4414998	4424701	I've tried so hard to get it to work through GeForce, but because you have to switch... Like, I've switched stuff to PTB, and tried to get it to reload, and still nothing.
4424701	4425482	So, yeah.
4431286	4443090	I'm actually really excited about this, plus I like that they're putting back in those little modes that they teased about in some of the surveys that went out.
4443090	4448512	They were really freaking fun, and seeing them in practice just makes me really, really happy about it.
4450871	4451331	All right.
4451331	4455232	Also, quick sidetrack, Jinx, Monsoon, and Doctor Who.
4455232	4457313	Yes, I said that earlier.
4457313	4457833	I know.
4457833	4458213	Yeah.
4458213	4459274	But I watched the scene.
4459274	4461154	Oh, did you?
4461154	4463935	And Jinx, Monsoon, and Doctor Who.
4463935	4464996	I'm so happy.
4464996	4466416	I know.
4466416	4470317	Lots of new Doctor Who fans all of a sudden with everything they're doing this season.
4470317	4472258	So good times.
4472258	4473458	All right.
4473458	4478100	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, I guess, back on Nintendo for a little bit.
4478100	4478300	Loki.
4479281	4496252	Yeah, so there was a comment by Nigel Laurie of Devolver Digital talking about how they feel that indie games do much better on the Switch than other consoles because Nintendo has cultivated a player base that's more open to interesting concepts and smaller games.
4497032	4505237	Nintendo has created an ecosystem and therefore a user base that is really open to interesting concepts and gameplay ideas.
4505237	4520345	The PlayStation and Xbox users, for as long as I've been doing this, there's been a lot of people that still like indie games, don't get me wrong, Cole Lamb has done very well on those platforms, but I think the large majority of those people buy those platforms to show off what they can really do.
4521125	4525848	I think platforms themselves are really strong believers in indie games.
4525848	4527129	They really do push them.
4527129	4541939	I think on our end, or on the other end, the consumers, as big as they might be, there's still a smaller portion that we would like on Xbox and PlayStation that are open to looking at a pixel art platform or going, I'll give this a shot.
4542586	4554116	I think that may be somewhat true, but I also think, too, that cost is a little bit of that, because if you look at like a lot of games that are on Switch, they don't ever get reduced in price.
4554116	4557258	And so, you know, at least first party titles don't.
4557258	4562442	And so you have a lot of this like, hey, my kid wants a new game to play.
4562442	4562823	Well,
4563595	4566018	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4576701	4583087	Smaller games or shorter games might be also more popular because you can take it with you and play it as you go.
4583087	4589352	I would think that's a huge part of it, is that for those games that are multi-platform, I know a lot of people personally that make this decision.
4589352	4602143	I don't always make the decision this way, but I know others that do that go, oh, well, OK, if I want to get Little Kitty, Big City and it's on PlayStation 5, Xbox and Switch, you know, I'm going to get the Switch version because that way I'll have it on the go.
4602623	4607905	I can have it portable because Sony and Microsoft don't have portable systems, at least not today.
4607905	4608905	We see Microsoft.
4608905	4611806	There's a lot of rumors about Microsoft want to get in that space.
4611806	4622769	But, you know, certainly, you know, things like the Nvidia shield and things like that, you know, kind of get in Steam Deck, I guess, kind of getting in that space, but nothing, nothing with the volume of the switch.
4622769	4629531	And I think that honestly, I think a big part of it is as simple as that, is that you feel like there's an extra perk to buying on the switch.
4629531	4632152	And that is, oh, I can play this on the go as well as on the TV.
4633871	4635853	Yeah.
4635853	4637534	So.
4637534	4638214	All right.
4638214	4644459	Well, moving on, let's talk to this is another follow up in the Nintendo series.
4644459	4646661	And we talked about this last week.
4646661	4652846	And it was confirmed that Nintendo World Championships is a game that is coming.
4652846	4654107	And it's coming in July.
4654107	4657990	It's called Nintendo World Championships NES edition.
4657990	4659191	And this is
4659531	4674883	This is pretty, oops, sorry, I'm gonna, sorry for the little volume that came through there, but sometimes I don't have my YouTubes completely prepared in advance, but I wanna show this on the second screen, because for those that haven't seen it, there's a whole little trailer that goes along, I'd like to welcome you all, be quiet.
4674883	4678706	A little second, a little trailer that goes along with this.
4678706	4683690	And the first half of it is just like interviewing a bunch of people that did the Nintendo World Championships before.
4683690	4687534	And then finally, like halfway through the trailer, we actually get into,
4688174	4701282	the actual gameplay itself, which will hopefully load for those of you that are watching live at some point, but I'm going to move on and talk about what is actually in this, because there's a bunch of games that are in it.
4701282	4706845	13 classic NES games that are in this, including Balloon Fight.
4706845	4708146	I don't know why it keeps buffering, guys.
4708146	4710787	Sorry about that.
4710787	4713509	And of course, now Loki standing up when I went cut to the screen.
4716452	4719013	The video keeps buffering over here and I don't know why.
4719013	4722795	Maybe I need to take down the quality or something and maybe it'll play better.
4722795	4723795	We'll see.
4723795	4726877	But anyway, 13 games that are going to be in this.
4726877	4738822	Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Excitebike, Ice Climber, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure, Metroid, Mario 1, 2, and 3, Mario Lost Levels, The Legend of Zelda, and Zelda 2, The Adventure of Link.
4738822	4741703	150 speedrun challenges.
4741703	4744425	You can warm up by doing, I guess,
4745645	4759209	You set and beat your own times in the single-player speedrun mode, and then you unlock new challenges and unique in-game pins along the way, and then up to eight players can actually compete locally in party mode.
4759209	4771192	If you are a Nintendo Switch Online member, you can do the World Championship mode to submit your best times in five challenges that rotate each week!
4771192	4772792	Listen, assholes!
4772792	4774193	I called it last week!
4775506	4780667	Did I not say this would be, wouldn't this be the stretch goal for Nintendo?
4780667	4793290	You could have different versions of the little cartridge and they could actually rotate every week and you'd have a little leaderboard that you could actually compete against your friends.
4793290	4795490	I fucking nailed it last week.
4795490	4796551	Where's my tiara?
4796551	4799571	Where's my crown?
4799571	4800852	Where's my cult?
4800852	4802612	I'm predicting the future over here, people.
4804306	4805526	Okay, Rob Stradamus.
4805526	4809407	Thank you.
4809407	4809727	All right.
4809727	4810068	Thank you.
4810068	4811048	I'll take my flowers.
4811048	4812508	Um, let's see.
4812508	4816589	DarkTetsuya says, I've been wanting them to revisit the idea of NES Remix.
4816589	4818350	And that's about what this is sounding like.
4818350	4819750	Yeah, for sure.
4819750	4826452	Um, DarkTetsuya says, I'm kind of excited for this, especially now that we know what it is.
4826452	4829653	PodCulture said, would Rob knock Bobby off the leaderboard?
4830293	4833556	hopefully, but we'll see.
4833556	4833896	We'll see.
4833896	4837298	It depends what the games are actually is would be my real answer to that.
4837298	4840421	But yeah, those those sons of bitches did it.
4840421	4842382	They really got an online version of this.
4842382	4846946	You're gonna be able to compete against your friends and the challenges rotate like they ought to.
4846946	4849087	And I know it says there's 13 games in it.
4849087	4852670	But but but what if they added more?
4854730	4855551	DarkSakura, what do you have?
4855551	4856392	Well, um, it's a
4878483	4886527	It's this dead thing that no one plays anymore that just serves to make us feel- I'm just kidding, it's DDR!
4886527	4897113	Konami announced that there is going to be a new DDR series, Dance Dance Revolution World, so a new version of the game.
4897113	4902796	There isn't any, like, date announced or any of the features, but
4905177	4906098	I like the style.
4906098	4910981	The style of it is very on the lines of like the 2DX styling, I think.
4910981	4912702	And it has Emi and Rage on it.
4912702	4918306	So, hey, welcome back from the abyss, you two.
4918306	4926611	I also think it's funny that like on this little ad, Rage on one of his little pouches has the old feet.
4926611	4932975	I noticed that right off the bat, too, that he has the little maniac, maniac sticker for the old difficulty.
4932975	4933376	I love it.
4934567	4937409	and apparently Emmy's underwear says Emmy.
4937409	4942033	Well, I mean, you know, she needs a belt anyway.
4942033	4949638	So they're going to be replacing the Revolution A3 cabinets with world once they have it released.
4949638	4957724	And they're leaving the A-verse behind because I think they just did a twenty
4959153	4964174	A20 Plus and A3 were the last two, right?
4964174	4967315	And so we'll see what happens.
4967315	4971235	I mean, don't forget, there's also that DDR Classic Mini.
4971235	4971596	Oh, yeah.
4971596	4973476	It's like one fifth the size.
4973476	4974616	That would be fun.
4974616	4979297	But hey, well, when we know more, y'all will know more.
4979297	4985218	My favorite is that this is called DDR World, but there's sure to be features that will only be available in Japan.
4985218	4987459	Hmm.
4987459	4988079	Hmm.
4988079	4988259	Hmm.
4989741	4997486	I think it's not available in most countries, actually, from all the feedback has been seen online from some local players.
4997486	5006632	If we can have a World Series baseball that only encompasses the United States and Canada, then they can have a World DDR.
5006632	5008273	I guess.
5008273	5008973	All right.
5008973	5012615	Besides that, Japanese baseball players would kick all of our asses.
5012615	5014076	World written in lowercase.
5014076	5014377	All right.
5014377	5017839	All right, let's move on.
5017839	5018099	Loki.
5020283	5035947	uh yes uh so the nintendo switch is going to be discontinuing support for um x or twitter um no one fucking calls it x i i i know i i know um stupid business ventures
5041979	5053266	As of June 10th, you will no longer be able to post screenshots and videos to Twitter from the Nintendo Switch's album or send friend requests to social media users via friend suggestions.
5053266	5062592	You can thank Elon Musk for this, for raising the cost of the Enterprise Tier API access, which is $42,000 a month.
5064893	5075421	And if, you know, considering that there's probably not many people using this feature, it doesn't make sense to pay this much to support this feature that not a lot of people are using.
5075421	5078103	So.
5078103	5084588	Oh, well, yeah, you can still download the pictures and upload them to social media that way, but it's certainly not as easy.
5084588	5085929	It's it's kind of a pain.
5085929	5093054	So and I believe Facebook will still be an option, too, because I think you can I know you can add friends through Facebook and I think you can share it to Facebook that way as well.
5093254	5094934	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5114039	5114759	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
5134045	5137787	dragged and dropped into the browser window and shared the screenshot that way.
5137787	5143090	But it's it's pretty easy to download the pictures to your phone because the switch can set up like that now.
5143090	5144511	They did that some time ago.
5144511	5146092	Yeah, I don't blame Nintendo.
5146092	5147092	Why spend that kind of money?
5147092	5150214	In fact, I thank them for not spending that money.
5150214	5150714	Yeah.
5150714	5154376	And also, I mean, like, yeah, it's just.
5154376	5160060	I'm just maybe they'll have something new on the next Nintendo Switch console thing, you know?
5160060	5160260	Yeah.
5161144	5164048	I mean, if they're smart, they'll have their own social media thing.
5164048	5168053	And I'm not talking about... Oh, God, what was it called on the Wii U?
5168053	5170175	Fucking... Wii-verse?
5170175	5170876	Was it Miiverse?
5170876	5173199	Miiverse.
5173199	5175321	But maybe I am talking about Miiverse a little bit.
5176840	5178602	Alright.
5178602	5186069	Well, Miiverse, unfortunately, will not be making its way to the Video Game Hall of Fame anytime soon, but we know the five games that will be.
5186069	5199803	So, selected for the Video Game Hall of Fame, which is hosted at the Strong National Museum of Play, the five candidates that will be inducted will be Ultima,
5200788	5206310	Mist, Asteroids, Resident Evil, and SimCity.
5206310	5225535	Now, I seem to recall that we had done like a fantasy league for this at some point on the show, but I could not, for the life of me, find the document that we had done that night to figure out what we had predicted in that category.
5226377	5229538	I thought we had our own Hall of Fame that we inducted things.
5229538	5230198	I don't know.
5230198	5231498	Possibly, possibly.
5231498	5247063	But I will say the games that did not make it that were on the shortlist were Elite, Guitar Hero, Metroid, Neopets, Tokimeki Memorial, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and You Don't Know Jack were the games that did not make it.
5247063	5247203	So.
5249598	5250239	Thanks for watching!
5268254	5269435	All right.
5269435	5271596	Anyhow, I'd love to go visit that museum someday.
5271596	5273597	It's it's in Rochester, New York.
5273597	5276719	So I have to go to upstate New York to go visit it.
5276719	5279240	So what else is out there?
5279240	5282622	I guess I could go to Niagara Falls while I'm out there.
5282622	5287865	But that's why they that's why they put like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland to get you to visit Cleveland.
5287865	5289426	So what can you do?
5289426	5290367	All right.
5290367	5292248	Oh, SSJ 100 Matt's up there now.
5292808	5294270	Oh, that's right.
5294270	5295571	Well, I guess we could take a trip.
5295571	5298695	We could take a trip together to the video game museum.
5298695	5299095	Why not?
5299095	5301077	All right.
5301077	5309447	Well, speaking of classic games, we have a segment here on this show where we induct games into our own Hall of Fame every single week in this segment.
5320140	5327909	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5327909	5332834	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5332834	5333355	All right.
5333355	5339902	And for some reason, I don't have the B-roll queued up, but I will get that while DarkSakura tells us what she picked for the classic game this week.
5341049	5344651	The classic game is one that came out in 2008.
5344651	5348894	It's a puzzle platform game called Tag, The Power of Paint.
5348894	5352856	And if that sounds familiar, stay tuned and I'll tell you why.
5352856	5359741	It was developed for Windows by Tag Team, which is a group of students from DigiPen Institute of Technology.
5359741	5361402	Again, something else that should sound familiar.
5362302	5372248	So basically you have to go through these grayscale cell shaded areas with paint.
5372248	5377312	You start off with green paint that lets you bounce off of things, but then you can find the cans for other colors.
5378192	5380553	And you also have like a paint eraser.
5380553	5386836	So you'll get red next, which causes you to quickly gain momentum.
5386836	5392418	And then blue lets you walk on any surfaces, be it vertical, be it a ceiling, whatever.
5394039	5401584	And so you have to use the combinations of these different physics to be able to reach the checkpoint.
5401584	5404667	And it really is just that simple of a concept.
5404667	5412892	It was developed by seven students for their course at DigiPen Institute of Technology.
5412892	5416475	And it took about 18 months to create.
5416475	5418636	They wrote a game engine from scratch.
5420338	5440889	They had to create the physics, and they started by, you know, going through this version of tag, like playground tag, to paint over, like paint to tag other players, but they dropped that because the different mechanics would have
5442287	5446108	would have been less enjoyable than the actual tagging.
5446108	5454931	So they had some power-ups in there, and then they actually just started going with the paint itself as the power-up.
5454931	5457292	You know, getting the different paints and seeing how they work together.
5460035	5475131	So they really listened to feedback as they developed it, and then the game was done, and they were able to submit it to the Independence Game Festival, and then said that once they had more funding, they'd do a more professional version.
5475131	5479615	So the game was actually released on Steam, actually, April 18, 2022.
5482659	5487683	But the original version was 2008, so it counts.
5487683	5492807	It won the student competition at the Independent Games Festival in 2009.
5492807	5497951	They were completely lauded by industry professionals.
5497951	5503935	The music went over very well, the complexity of the puzzles, the way the graphics integrated with the mechanics.
5507578	5515241	It was considered to be, and this is a quote, a compelling piece of puzzle design.
5515241	5529547	And yeah, GameSpot actually said that it seemed like the game was a cross between Portal and Mirror's Edge and found it simple yet, you know, well integrated.
5529547	5532628	So now here's where things get familiar.
5533672	5543423	The programmers were hired by Valve to incorporate their puzzle elements into a game that they were working on the time, Portal 2.
5544946	5555375	just the same way that Valve went to the DigiPen students who did Narbacular Drop to help create Portal.
5555375	5559058	So I'm sensing a theme.
5559058	5567145	But yes, the group that made this game were brought on to work on Portal 2.
5567145	5569568	And so that's why
5572150	5580281	That's why everyone should find this whole game concept or even the game itself very familiar.
5580281	5582584	And that's it.
5582584	5583145	All right.
5583145	5585788	Yeah, I had no idea what this was when I first read the name.
5585788	5588772	And then when I saw the video, I was like, Oh, that's right.
5588772	5588852	Yeah.
5590697	5604742	Like even in this little clip here, you know, with, uh, you know, doing bouncing and everything and, and, you know, sliding around all this is missing as a portal, you know?
5604742	5605863	Yeah, for sure.
5605863	5607303	Um, and it's kind of neat.
5607303	5610124	Wall jumping mechanics, everything.
5610124	5618828	It's kind of neat how Valve finds these very indie college built titles and sort of, you know, puts them into their, you know, essentially AAA games.
5618828	5619308	It's pretty cool.
5622908	5624790	All right.
5624790	5629193	There is your classic game of the week tag.
5629193	5632115	What was the subtitle on that?
5632115	5633296	The Power of Paint.
5633296	5634757	The Power of Paint.
5634757	5634897	Right.
5636739	5638060	Um, let's move on.
5638060	5640040	We got some more news for y'all.
5640040	5641861	And then we'll be taking your calls.
5641861	5643622	If we have any tonight.
5643622	5644942	Emails and all that good stuff.
5644942	5649304	VOGnetwork.com slash discord is where you can join us and chat throughout the week.
5649304	5654046	Participate at Orangelandradio.com is where you can send us emails if you like.
5654046	5658328	Let's do some rapid fire news and talk about quickly some other headlines going on in the gaming space.
5658328	5659188	We'll go to Loki first.
5660260	5669826	There's been some rumors that apparently a LEGO and Sony collaboration is in the works and about to be announced very soon.
5669826	5681593	According to Tom Henderson, who is an industry insider, says, I know something, or I'm not particularly fond of the I know something and you don't vague insider BS, but from what I
5682514	5695770	No, there is a LEGO Horizon trailer that's ready to go, which makes sense because there was a LEGO Horizon set that I actually have on my computer right now.
5695770	5697952	So, yeah, maybe we'll see that very soon.
5698857	5714347	And then if you're a fan of classic FPS games, Marathon, a very classic Bungie title, is now available on Steam for free.
5714347	5718090	And so you can go get that.
5718090	5723213	And play it to your heart's content.
5723213	5724614	I will.
5724614	5727796	Until the new one comes out.
5727796	5728577	Whenever that might be.
5730799	5733300	late 2025.
5733300	5735902	All right.
5735902	5743026	You think it'll actually make 2025 and not get delayed?
5743026	5745468	I mean, who's who's publishing it?
5745468	5746909	Is it Bungie that's doing it?
5746909	5747149	Mm hmm.
5749540	5756886	I mean, I could see them saying that they need to allocate resources to Destiny 3 or live service games or something like that.
5756886	5760669	And so therefore they can't marathon will be a live service game to that.
5760669	5764792	Oh, well, I guess we can ruin it further.
5764792	5765733	All right.
5765733	5766814	Well, let's move on.
5766814	5771078	Oh, this this was another one where when I saw this headline, I was like, Oh, DarkSakura wants to talk about this on OLR.
5772878	5783186	Yeah, so another series I'm super fond of is Cotton, and Cotton reboot High Tension has been announced for Switch.
5783186	5791573	It is going to be released, they're saying Spring 2025 in Japan, and it's a sequel to the previous Cotton reboot.
5792633	5795436	And there's some character designs released.
5795436	5801862	And there is a new playable character called Makaron and a villain named Willow.
5801862	5810129	And there is a voice cast, casting auditions going out right now.
5810129	5811050	All right.
5811050	5811290	Nice.
5812953	5814974	Sounds like it'll be fun.
5814974	5815595	All right.
5815595	5819857	Um, let's talk about a game that I think has been brought up on the show before.
5819857	5827721	And it's a game that Alan actually introduced me to because when he was streaming, he hasn't streamed in a little while, but when he was streaming, he used to do music games on Monday.
5827721	5835565	And almost just in time for his birthday, because this is right around his birthday, Spin Rhythm XD is getting released for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, the
5836946	5843310	PlayStation VR 2, that should be interesting, and SteamVR, and that's all coming out on July 9th.
5843310	5846672	So this is coming out from Super Spin Digital.
5846672	5861481	A free update that will add virtual reality support to the existing PC or Steam version will also be available on the Steam date, on the same date, and that's going to be very interesting as well because that's the one that a lot of people have hacked, modded, etc.
5861481	5864783	to add their own songs, but we don't, we're not supposed to talk about that openly.
5866664	5869946	Download Content Pack with 10 new tracks and skins for all available platforms!
5895023	5897245	Alright, spin rhythm.
5897245	5902709	In the meantime, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner than that.
5902709	5908334	Some games coming out this week in May in world release dates starting with the US, Loki.
5908334	5919803	We have Homeworld 3 on PC, Braid Anniversary Edition on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, iOS, and Android.
5920789	5946440	Biomutant on Nintendo Switch, Neptunia Game Maker R Evolution on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Beladins on PC, Ghosts of Tsushima Director's Cut on PC, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes on PC and Nintendo Switch, and RoboBeat on PC.
5949330	5956917	Alrighty, let's travel over to Japan and check out what is coming out there now that we finally have Golden Week behind us.
5956917	5962962	I think we're starting to get some releases again, including on the Nintendo Switch, we have Biomutant comes out on the 14th.
5962962	5966324	And then we have on the Switch Garden Life, a cozy simulator on the 16th.
5968326	5969827	Bloodstained Ritual of the Night
5984475	5989758	Garden Life, a cozy simulator, is also coming out on the 16th, and that's really the only release.
5989758	5994200	So I guess it still is kind of a slow week, even now being on the other side of Golden Week.
5994200	5995281	But things ramp up again next week.
5995281	5998302	I think we have Paper Mario next week, so things start to ramp up again.
5998302	6002565	So, in the meantime, let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.
6002565	6004026	It is pretty slow there, too.
6004026	6007287	On the 14th, for Switch, we have Biomutant.
6007287	6010309	On the 16th, we have, for Switch and PlayStation, Pool Party.
6011502	6016747	And then on the 17th for the three consoles, we have My Little Pony, a Zephyr Heights mystery.
6016747	6021451	Oh, also, Slave Zero X for PlayStation and Switch.
6021451	6022572	All right.
6022572	6023233	Well, let's move on.
6023233	6024734	We have just a few more stories for you.
6024734	6026897	And then we'll get to what you guys want to talk about.
6026897	6029199	So we've had an announcement of an announcement.
6029199	6031361	And now we have an update to address an update, right, Loki?
6032296	6047799	Yes, well this is very appropriate coming from Bethesda because their last update that they did to add more performance enhancements to Fallout 4 and better graphics
6049705	6053867	didn't quite do a lot and broke a lot of things.
6053867	6063191	And so now they have a new update coming out on the 13th, which is going to be updating Fallout 4 on all platforms.
6063191	6069593	And this update will include new options for graphics and performance settings, as well as further fixes and improvements.
6069593	6076816	Once again, breaking the mods I'm going to play on the game.
6076816	6077596	Cool.
6077596	6078337	Thanks.
6078337	6078857	Please stop.
6083689	6104527	Alright, one more story for you and it has to do with something else that Sarah Bond talked about in that Bloomberg interview that didn't get as much coverage as that other quote that we played earlier in the show, but she also mentioned that Microsoft is launching a web-based store to download mobile games and get add-ons and in-app purchases and all of that.
6105527	6113870	So they've decided to do it as a browser store instead of an app to make it, quote, accessible across all devices, all countries, no matter what.
6113870	6117772	So you're not in a single ecosystem or what have you.
6117772	6122214	And Microsoft will only have its own games to begin with.
6122214	6125995	That means probably Activision Blizzard as well, because that's part of Microsoft now.
6125995	6126875	So we'll see.
6128516	6133160	You might also recall that Activision Blizzard included King and what did King make?
6133160	6134481	Candy Crush.
6134481	6142207	So I'm sure that's going to be a big part of this store as well, which might also be a big part of why they bought Activision Blizzard King in the first place.
6142207	6144248	So we'll see how that goes.
6144248	6153756	Minecraft is also suggested as one of the first games you'll be able to get, which does make a lot of sense that they would, you know, have that on mobile phones as well, and have that available in their store.
6154856	6182088	a spokesperson from Xbox said this is just the first step in the journey to building a trusted app store with its roots in gaming which sounds like the most generic thing I've ever heard or something of this nature but it is doing a thing and we're going to see more of these stores open up as the whole EU digital market acts or DMA's rules went into effect and we know Epic's planning their own thing and so on and so on so we'll see if Microsoft's store is
6184056	6185017	going to be worth the visit.
6185017	6188740	But I have to be honest, none of those things sound particularly exciting to me.
6188740	6191402	I am not a candy crush person.
6191402	6194304	I think games like Minecraft are better left to devices.
6194304	6198747	But I guess Minecraft always had, you know, Minecraft had a huge audience on iPad.
6198747	6200408	So what do I know?
6200408	6206753	So, but I feel like a lot of those games are just better left to something with a tangible input device and not so much the touchscreen.
6206753	6212298	But if Microsoft would invent something for touchscreen mobile, then maybe I'd be a little more excited.
6212918	6217940	But wasn't Minecraft World, what the hell did they call that Minecraft AR game?
6217940	6218720	Minecraft Earth.
6218720	6220140	Minecraft Earth.
6220140	6223741	They let that have a good like six months, then they killed that, didn't they?
6223741	6224802	That was disappointing.
6224802	6228363	It wasn't very long, which is too bad, because I think there was some potential there.
6228363	6233004	It was still a little bit janky, but they did have like a lot of unique.
6233004	6235965	It was pretty, it was OK.
6235965	6238866	It was it was kind of fun to mess around with.
6240990	6244091	I think it was a bit early and ambitious.
6244091	6253133	The thing that I am most upset about with that is they have a ton of assets that they created for that game that they're literally just sitting on and not doing anything with them.
6253133	6256174	Like, can you please just put them in the vanilla game?
6256174	6260815	I mean, like, honestly, like you have all this stuff done.
6260815	6262496	Just put it in the game.
6262496	6263656	Why is this a problem?
6265305	6268189	Alright, well, that was our last slotted story for tonight.
6268189	6270092	So we're going to go to the listener roundtable.
6270092	6276081	We want to invite your calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord, but we also like to invite your emails every week.
6276081	6278424	Participate at orange lounge radio.com.
6278424	6280407	I'm not sure if I saw anything this week, though.
6280407	6281429	But let me check with DarkSakura.
6284094	6285955	Echofilter, insert here.
6285955	6288335	No, no, no, no.
6288335	6289656	All right.
6289656	6292536	So no emails this week, but we'll invite for the future weeks.
6292536	6294557	Participate at OrangeLongstreet.com.
6294557	6303339	I don't see anybody in our green room yet, but while we wait, also, if you want to just shout out a question in chat, I know some of you are here every week and you never go to the green room and that's fine.
6303339	6306400	And not everybody wants to talk and do all that thing.
6306400	6310041	But if you want to put questions in chat, we are all about answering those as well.
6310821	6318163	Um, or, you know, and technically on a week like this, where we haven't even hit the two hour mark yet talking about games.
6318163	6322124	Sometimes we're willing to talk about non game stuff to within reason.
6322124	6323124	Keep it cute.
6323124	6323785	All right.
6323785	6329986	Um, this isn't one of those like, ask me anonymously things and all the questions end up being dirty.
6329986	6333867	It isn't that all right.
6333867	6334847	It is Mother's Day.
6334847	6336528	Don't ask a question you wouldn't ask your mother.
6337308	6341253	I did spread something at work for the record.
6341253	6346340	The classic words of Chi-Chi Devane.
6346340	6347882	I don't get ready, I stay ready.
6347882	6349765	I don't get ready, I stay ready.
6349765	6351427	If you're born ready, you don't have to get ready.
6351427	6353590	All right.
6353590	6355031	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
6355871	6356932	I did.
6356932	6364920	So there is some updates regarding the software called N64 Recomp.
6364920	6369324	It is this developer Wiseguy who put it together.
6369324	6371886	So you may remember this person, Dave.
6373087	6384201	actually done a lot of these recompiling reports, essentially decompiling Nintendo 64 games and recompiling them to run natively on PC.
6384201	6391810	And with this, one of the newest games to support that is actually Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask.
6393091	6411795	And along with that, though, he has software now that will actually allow you to do this with any Nintendo 64 game to allow you to natively, well, some of the games, Banjo-Kazooie, Rocket Robot and even Superman 64.
6411795	6418436	I wonder if that would actually then further work through a game porting kit on a Mac.
6419534	6423618	I hope that thing is mirrored on webarchive.org or something before Nintendo shuts us down.
6443012	6444616	Get that on.
6444616	6447943	I guess Sunday is a good day to put that out because the lawyers aren't working on Sunday.
6447943	6449045	So yeah.
6449045	6453415	And Native, you know, Goldeneye or something like that would be interesting.
6454501	6456222	Um, we do have a call in the green room.
6456222	6457202	I'm going to bring in here in a minute.
6457202	6464705	But SSJ100 Matt does want to point out before Tiger Claw says it again, because this was mentioned in our discord server earlier this week.
6464705	6468107	We're getting a John Wick pinball and a Funhaus remake pinball table.
6468107	6481572	We did mention John Wick briefly at the top of the show when we were talking about DarkSakura going to the Golden State pinball and maybe I'm going to go to actually, but I don't think the Funhaus remake came up and I'm curious what you think about that like the remaking of the pinball.
6481792	6487538	I mean, I know it's not the first pinball table to ever be remade, but... Yeah, not your first choice of a pinball table to remake.
6488425	6497106	I, I, I, I have slight chlorophobia and the, like that, just that head, like just drives me.
6497106	6500647	I like, we had, we had a fun house and I can't stand it.
6500647	6504668	Like I'm fine with like, no fear, you know, the skull head on there.
6504668	6510749	And besides that, it's Steve Ritchie doing the voice and Steve's an awesome guy, but, um, but no fun house.
6510749	6512369	No, I can't anything with the clown.
6512369	6517670	Like I have trouble with, you know, what pinball table do you want to see him remake?
6519147	6519568	Remade
6533433	6546664	Not like Black Knight Sword of Rage or Black Knight 2000, but just a modern... Well, even just take Black Knight and then Black Knight 2000 and have, like, current tech-level versions of those.
6546664	6560355	Almost like what they did with Bride of Pinbot 2.0, where it has, like, the color DMD and everything, but have something that's more like an LCD screen or something.
6561188	6565413	SJ100 Matt in chat says, Jamie had a fun house, now she just has a house.
6565413	6570037	You know, but... My house is more fun than anybody else's house, okay?
6570037	6573200	It's still pretty fun with all those pinball tables.
6573200	6573861	Yeah.
6573861	6576964	PodCulture says, what would an OLR table be like?
6576964	6579246	Oh, God.
6579246	6580788	Chaos and food and cats.
6580788	6582710	It would break.
6582710	6583771	The balls would get stuck.
6586845	6611336	uh we would have uh actually there would be there would be Loki's never-ending ramp where there would be a ramp that you would shoot the ball and it just stays in the ramp the rest of the game it's just the ball keeps going around and around and around and up and around and the ball just never comes out like the ball just stays in the ramp that would be it no it stays in the ramp until we get to FFS mode for fuck's sake and then we have a Loki multi ball
6613716	6615997	PogCulture says would Bobby have the high score?
6615997	6618618	No, but Mrs. Blackwolf would.
6618618	6621540	Bobby Blackwolf says it would be like the Ava table.
6621540	6623321	I wish.
6623321	6624501	Don't tease me with that.
6624501	6625662	I wish.
6625662	6626242	All right.
6626242	6631024	Or it'd be like Jamie corner that's got like hodgepodge boyfriend plushies.
6631024	6635927	Orange Right says every time it loops around it says rah rah rah rah rah rah rah.
6635927	6638048	And then when the ball finally drops out it goes what?
6639901	6641402	Yeah, we do have a caller.
6641402	6643963	And don't forget about the empty mailbag.
6643963	6646004	A caller has been paid.
6646004	6654908	But when you shoot the pinball in there, it goes, you know, yeah, you literally have an empty mailbag, but you lock the ball in there and it goes, Hello, LR, YYR here.
6654908	6657949	Like, that's right.
6657949	6660370	Anyway, Ferret only has one tee.
6660370	6663112	And then Red Retainment would also be in the mailbag.
6663112	6664712	Mishkins.
6664712	6667974	And then you have your little sub game of bungee ferret tossing.
6669242	6673325	But for our UK audience, it would have to be throwing.
6673325	6681251	I was thinking Garth Wolf emails us once in a while, too, but not this weekend because FWA is this weekend, and I feel like that event's only getting bigger and bigger.
6681251	6688576	Like I'm seeing all these pictures and so many people I know they're going like FWA is not as big as Dragon Con yet, but damn, it's going to be a big convention out there.
6688576	6690397	And that's furry week in Atlanta, for those that don't know.
6690397	6692178	But that that is getting bigger and bigger.
6692178	6696682	So pod culture just actually made me think of a fun drag queen furry name.
6696682	6697842	Hmm.
6697842	6698503	Ferret Fawcett.
6699588	6706273	Okay, so I have to bring up one thing real quick, Rob, while we get our caller in.
6706273	6713598	One of the drag queens that you can like perform against in that stupid little game is called GG Easy.
6713598	6715879	Oh, that's cute.
6715879	6717240	That's a cute name.
6717240	6718801	Yeah, G-I-G-I and then Easy.
6718801	6719382	I love it.
6719382	6720202	All right.
6720202	6722264	We do have a caller on the line who's been patiently waiting.
6722264	6723825	Hello, LR, you're on the show.
6723825	6724145	Who's this?
6725552	6727519	It's the one and only Neighborhood Ranma.
6727519	6728863	How's everybody doing tonight?
6728863	6729867	Uh, fantastic.
6729867	6730468	How are you, Ranma?
6731308	6733829	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6756920	6758661	Caught off guard or anything like that.
6758661	6759362	No, I gotcha.
6759362	6759582	I gotcha.
6759582	6759822	Sorry.
6759822	6763245	It can be a tricky waiting game sometimes, but I appreciate you hanging in there.
6763245	6764566	I totally get it.
6764566	6766967	Well, what's on your mind tonight, my friend?
6766967	6770070	I want to go back to the comment that I made about- I'm sorry, quickly.
6770070	6771030	And this is a visual thing.
6771030	6772251	I'm sorry, the podcast listeners.
6772251	6775554	But Ranma's sitting there and he has his camera on, which is always lovely to see you.
6775554	6780237	But then I noticed tonight you have a big curtain hanging up, like obscuring whatever.
6780237	6783039	So I'm always like, pay no attention.
6783039	6785181	Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
6786761	6789323	or whatever might be hiding back there.
6789323	6805678	Mr. Rob Roberts, I know I don't come on this show a lot, but I'm just wondering, you're just now noticing the curtain that divides my main room from the kitchen and where my my coffeemaker and my sexy air fryer is?
6805678	6806518	Am I crazy?
6806518	6808380	Has it been a different angle before?
6808380	6810402	I swear to God, I have not seen that curtain.
6811491	6823562	No, it might be a slightly different angle because my camera used to be more focused towards me, but I got like a fancy like light that sits on top of my monitor to help stuff like that.
6823562	6823882	So.
6823882	6824783	Okay, well now I understand.
6824783	6826024	So there's a kitchen back there.
6826024	6826464	All right.
6826464	6827925	Now I know where the coffee comes from.
6827925	6829046	It's a jelly kitchen, you know.
6830800	6831661	Yeah, thank you.
6831661	6832741	Okay, so chat is agreeing.
6832741	6835323	It was a different angle and the closet was directly behind you.
6835323	6837205	So you couldn't see the curtain as easily.
6837205	6839066	So that's probably what it was.
6839066	6839286	Yeah.
6839286	6841027	So long story short, I'm not crazy.
6841027	6843509	Anyway, what is it you want to talk about tonight?
6843509	6846391	I want the comment about I mentioned about Microsoft.
6846391	6851214	So I want to put it out there that I am a former Microsoft employee.
6851214	6851534	So
6852575	6864172	I wanna say first things first, I was out earlier tonight, and I was listening to Bobby Blackwolf, and I'm listening to you guys, and one thing I really appreciate about both shows is that- And how hard did you throw your phone?
6864172	6866475	Actually, no, I didn't.
6866475	6868058	I didn't throw my phone at all.
6868058	6868378	Because
6869249	6871131	Bobby made a lot of sense.
6871131	6872633	You made a lot of sense.
6872633	6877318	The issue is a lot of these other podcasts that are talking about what's going on with Microsoft.
6877318	6879560	They're not telling the whole story.
6879560	6884846	They're just telling enough where they can beat Microsoft with a shovel and bury them.
6884846	6886327	Because I'll tell you this right now.
6887208	6892735	No matter what happens with the Xbox gaming division, Microsoft is going to be alright.
6892735	6900604	What people forget is that about 75-80% of Microsoft profits come from the enterprise.
6900604	6905409	That's where all the money is coming from and they funnel it into the gaming division.
6905409	6907532	And that's basically the long and short.
6908456	6931902	now and that would be and that would be windows and office especially in businesses the whole business loop and um media management services uh mdm for microsoft branded phones and products and as i was telling one person who is a such a sony fan boy and looks for any reason to bash microsoft i said look
6933314	6938098	As long as there's a Game Pass, there will always be an Xbox console.
6938098	6942322	As long as there is Microsoft Windows, there will always be a Surface.
6942322	6946966	Because they need first party hardware to show off what the software can do.
6946966	6951290	Because it would be kind of embarrassing to Microsoft if they had...
6952492	6956395	a Macbook and a Playstation showing off Game Pass.
6956395	6962241	They need to have their own hardware to show what the software can do and what it's capable of.
6962241	6963782	That's what people need to understand.
6963782	6964563	Now, secondly,
6966047	6979430	Looking at how the rank and file structure is reminds me of something that they told us in training is that when you work for the Microsoft retail stores, you don't work for a subsidiary of Microsoft.
6979430	6981391	You work directly for Microsoft.
6981391	6984431	Basically, Satella is your end boss.
6984431	6988992	Now they brought that up because they mentioned Apple for a brief moment.
6988992	6991253	I do not know if it's still the same thing.
6991253	6992093	They had said that
6992353	6998278	The Apple Store is focused as a subsidiary and basically Tim Cook is not your boss.
6998278	6999399	That's incorrect.
6999399	6999959	Okay.
6999959	7003482	Like I said, it's been about 10 years since I've worked there.
7003482	7005183	So this is what they told us in training.
7005183	7012670	So now the reason why I bring that up, look at DC.
7012670	7015612	Look at how DC does their movies and so forth.
7015612	7018594	DC gets things going pretty well.
7018594	7021757	Then Warner Brothers comes in and says, no, no.
7022495	7023516	No.
7023516	7024737	No.
7024737	7025657	Make the movie.
7025657	7026718	They make the movie.
7026718	7028700	Good possibility the movie's going to tank out.
7028700	7030721	Unless it's Wonder Woman.
7030721	7032082	Yes, that too.
7032082	7035145	Now, look at Marvel.
7035145	7039448	And Disney's like, here's a couple million dollars, go handle your business.
7042573	7044775	Marvel is like a subsidiary.
7044775	7048418	They work within themselves to get things done.
7048418	7050780	And Disney's like, okay, let's roll with it.
7050780	7056085	Whereas DC tries to do that, but Warner Brothers is like, nah, that's not going to work that way.
7057133	7059234	Microsoft gaming is kind of the same way.
7059234	7071901	The Xbox gaming division kind of has their shit together for the most part, but then the higher-ups who don't, who have the MBAs like Bobby said, who don't know the gaming, like you said, say, no, this is not going to work.
7073662	7086875	I am more than inclined to believe that a lot of the issues within Microsoft's gaming division is not the gaming division itself, it's the higher-ups who sit on the board who don't know what video gaming is.
7089713	7091174	No, I'm pointing in agreement.
7091174	7091934	Yes.
7091934	7092755	Go off.
7092755	7093535	Go off, my brother.
7093535	7095677	That's basically what it is.
7095677	7103121	And that's why I'm not shocked or upset or worried about Microsoft, because that's exactly how it is.
7103121	7105623	Well, I'm shocked and upset, but in a different way.
7106641	7107721	Exactly.
7107721	7108861	Now look at Sony.
7108861	7115163	Sony has a gaming division, they have an animation division, movie division, all these other divisions.
7115163	7116543	Go Voltron Force!
7116543	7119923	Has to bring money together in order to make the profits.
7119923	7124684	And God forbid, one of the appendages of Sony doesn't do what they can.
7124684	7133946	And if you haven't noticed, they're trying to become, they're trying to go from the appendages of Voltron to the Infinity Gauntlet as they try to acquire Paramount.
7135510	7150428	um, I want to I want to bring this comment up because Bobby said this in chat and he said this a few times on his show and on social media and it is it is accurate but it's also that where like perception fucks everything right so Bobby Blackwell in chat says great art takes risks
7150868	7154490	Great MBAs running businesses minimize risks, right?
7154490	7161573	And that kind of ties into what I said earlier is that the reason why the perception and that is like what Bobby is saying is 100% true.
7161573	7163835	But we all know perception is king, right?
7163835	7169517	And most gamers out there with an active social media account do not give two fucks about the business side of it.
7169517	7172379	But it all plays into that whole thing I said earlier, where
7172719	7183784	For years and years of years, we have been carrying this banner and fighting this fight and trying to legitimize video games under this banner and this rallying cry of video games are art.
7183784	7191828	But this week has been a swift kick in the cooch of nope, video games are a business.
7191828	7195050	And that's why this whole thing sucks.
7195050	7195610	And you're right.
7195610	7197551	Now, let's go back a little bit.
7197551	7199092	Now, let's say Microsoft
7200573	7204395	They basically shut down the studios.
7204395	7212799	Now, all the other gaming podcasts or whatever, they can read why Tango Gameworks did what happened.
7212799	7218122	But somehow, they'll see that it's Microsoft's fault that it all happened.
7218122	7220643	Ergo, it's Microsoft's fault that the studios are closed.
7220643	7225966	Even though there have been these issues going on before, Microsoft's like, hey, what's going on down there, you know?
7228103	7233307	because Microsoft is the father, and they dropped the money, and they're supposed to be responsible, you know?
7233307	7238632	Some things don't always happen that way.
7238632	7241734	There was another comment, because this has led to a whole thing in our chat.
7241734	7250862	You were doing your DC versus Marvel thing earlier, Ranma, and PodCulture said, DC has great animated stuff, Marvel not as much.
7250862	7253905	Now, whilst everyone is entitled to their own opinion,
7255066	7263812	I'm gonna say that is a very hard statement to swallow when X-Men 97 is all the rage right now.
7263812	7266434	It's a very hard statement to swallow.
7266434	7270117	My favorite German blueberry muffin is now on the team.
7270117	7271478	I'm so happy.
7271478	7274480	Let me say this about X-Men 97 real quick and we'll get back to the matter at hand here.
7274480	7274801	Yeah, sure.
7275561	7286414	In my 20 plus years of watching cartoons and anime and all of that, only 5 times I have watched a series where I felt myself crying like a damn baby.
7286414	7287435	X-Men 97 hit that list!
7294275	7301858	I did not bring that up to dunk on what Brad said, because again, everybody's entitled to their opinion, and maybe that particular series is out of sight right now.
7301858	7308420	But the reason why I did bring it up, again, the business end of things sometimes suck versus the art.
7308420	7316063	Aren't I correct in that the creator and writer and main driver behind that series is already not with Marvel anymore?
7316063	7316663	That's correct.
7316663	7321845	And now they're trying to, now fans are demanding that he come, are demanding that Marvel brings him back, you know.
7323075	7327037	And the show's already got license, already been greenlit for a season two.
7327037	7329859	But will it land the same without, again, it's hard to say.
7329859	7334602	I guess we don't know until we see it, but is it going to land the same without the same creative force at the helm?
7334602	7338004	I don't know, but we're all superman in Spider-Man 98.
7338004	7341946	They're going to, like, drag Claremont out of retirement.
7341946	7348470	And then when he goes, they're going to hook his brain up to a machine and have the Claremont AI with so many plot twists that we won't know what to do.
7349281	7351383	Don't give them ideas.
7351383	7355426	And then part of that AI is going to incorporate Rob Liefeld's lack of feet.
7355426	7360870	And everyone will be ballerinas walking around with 70 different storylines that all somehow have to do with Phoenix.
7360870	7363431	What in the hell?
7363431	7366273	Sounds like a choose your own adventure book.
7366273	7369736	That sounds like early 80s X-Men.
7369736	7370336	All right.
7370336	7373118	So we've gone from Microsoft to X-Men, which is fine.
7373118	7376041	But, Ranma, any other thoughts you wanted to get out before we let you go tonight?
7376914	7378335	That's it.
7378335	7379735	I just want to get that out.
7379735	7387759	And again, I appreciate that both of these shows brought in the insight to everything, because there is a saying.
7387759	7389640	They say there's two sides to every story.
7389640	7391881	No, there are four sides to every story.
7391881	7397044	What he said, what she said, what people perceived when it happened, and then there's a truth.
7397044	7405468	But by the time we get to the truth, which is where we see what's all going on, nobody gives a damn at that point, because people already believe what they perceived is what really had happened.
7406636	7408898	No, that's that's absolutely it.
7408898	7413961	You know, we try and I'm I'm not being shady with this comment because I want to support all podcasts.
7413961	7422788	I try to support most YouTubers, although I got to say there's some sort of culture over there sometimes that it really leans into the sensationalism and I do not like it.
7422788	7434396	But and I hate to say this on Bobby Blackwolf's birthday, but sometimes we try to be the adults in the room when it's appropriate.
7434396	7434536	Well,
7435390	7442034	Well, that means we're going to need to get an adultier adult at this point.
7442034	7445496	Sometimes we try to be the grandparents in the room.
7445496	7448638	Oh, God.
7448638	7451719	Rob, I have convention children.
7451719	7452740	Please don't.
7452740	7454061	Please don't.
7454061	7455802	All right.
7455802	7457403	What convention is up next?
7457403	7458904	Oh, go ahead, Jamie.
7458904	7462906	I'm actually going to leave just mention one thing that's on my adulting calendar.
7463937	7470680	The month of May is adulting is automatically spending $50 every time you leave the house.
7470680	7473202	I guess.
7473202	7478964	Ranma, what conventions up next for you for our talks on anime jam session Tuesday nights?
7478964	7481826	Our next convention is shenanigan.
7481826	7483126	It's in June.
7483126	7485748	It is a 21 plus two day convention.
7486688	7488650	Not enough of those in this country.
7488650	7491292	A 21 plus two day convention.
7491292	7491873	Yes.
7491873	7494435	That sounds like a disaster.
7494435	7496157	I can't wear a Hot Mess Express.
7496157	7496737	Not a disaster.
7496737	7497898	A Hot Mess Express.
7497898	7499319	Where do I sign up?
7499319	7501481	Those are two very different things.
7501481	7505025	Jamie, you should know about the people that are running Shenanigan.
7505025	7505985	Oh, yeah.
7505985	7506346	Yeah.
7506346	7507627	It's the people that run DerpyCon.
7508832	7510052	Oh, really?
7510052	7511313	Yes, really.
7511313	7512493	Is DerpyCon still?
7512493	7523636	OK, I need to reach out to some of those people because I hadn't heard anything about the guidebook this year, which, y'all know, I have been the DerpyCon guidebook person for like almost a decade now.
7523636	7529078	Now I'm supposed to go fly out to the con and then COVID.
7529078	7530898	Where is Shenanigan?
7530898	7533219	Shenanigan is in Parsippany, New Jersey.
7538342	7540105	Yes, I know Rob.
7540105	7541086	I know.
7541086	7544151	Nobody goes to Jersey willingly.
7544151	7544973	I know.
7544973	7546395	I understand this.
7546395	7546916	Mr. Farmer?
7548317	7548537	Cows?
7572267	7577668	Now, literally, I know there's no such thing as stupid questions.
7577668	7579688	However... Yeah, there are.
7579688	7580188	There are.
7580188	7588150	And one of them would actually be, what kind of shenanigans happen in Parsippany, New Jersey?
7588150	7590150	The kind of shenanigans that lead out of Parsippany.
7590150	7592110	That's a dumb fucking question.
7592110	7595171	Rob, I'm just gonna say this.
7595171	7600652	When you say there's no such thing as a stupid question, I want you to do my job for two hours.
7601650	7603210	Just two hours!
7603210	7611732	No, I think Rob's job probably involves a good number of... I didn't pay attention, so I'm gonna ask a stupid question.
7611732	7619693	No, I actually had someone call into the help desk asking how to restart their machine.
7619693	7620693	I'm sorry.
7620693	7622914	Bobby's saying something else in chat.
7622914	7624054	Is this true?
7624054	7629175	The big guest is an anime therapist.
7629175	7629595	Well...
7631161	7634626	He- Carl is not an anime therapist per se.
7634626	7638472	He actually has his MSW in social work.
7638472	7645582	He does actual social work, but he's been part of the con scene and anime scene for so long, he knows how to do an even blend of both.
7647847	7650411	So, what exactly is that?
7650411	7654576	It makes me think of the guys that do cinema therapy.
7654576	7660705	I promise to God I'm not trying to be shady, but I just noticed on the Shenanigan page, he is the only guest coming.
7660705	7664731	Otherwise, please look forward to this at the Embassy Suites in Parsippany, New Jersey.
7665635	7670616	Well, like I said, Carl does have his actual MSW in social work.
7670616	7673157	He does an equal blend of both, okay?
7673157	7681279	Because the last time someone tried to pull this off, they did not have their degree, and they've currently been banned by the APA to practice anything at all.
7681279	7684040	So basically, their degree in psychology is useless.
7684040	7686360	No, it's actually 4D chess.
7686360	7687641	It is all 4D chess.
7687641	7690822	Who's the only guest we need to bring to the shenanigan con?
7690822	7691582	A therapist.
7692580	7695342	It's 40 fuckin' chats and I applaud it.
7695342	7698405	I will say, Uncle Yo is an amazing person.
7698405	7701907	If you go on YouTube and look up his- I think I've heard of him before.
7701907	7706711	Yes, if you look up his- Well, and make it Aurelio Voltaire at DerpyCon.
7706711	7708112	Oh, Voltaire's fuckin' rad.
7708112	7708593	I like him.
7708593	7710474	Yeah.
7710474	7717079	I literally- I got to host a thing that he did here in Sacramento, and I kinda said, Hey, I'm Rob Roberts, it's nice to meet you.
7717079	7719021	It's really weird to see you outside of DragonCon.
7722937	7725759	I don't know how he took that, but whatever.
7725759	7737665	I expect Shanannica to have a few more guests, because this is sort of like an experiment per se, because registration opens tomorrow and is capped at 450 people, just to see how it goes.
7737665	7738165	Okay.
7738165	7741046	They can have me as a guest.
7741046	7744788	Or basically, I'll just sit around and talk about my cat in Dead by Daylight.
7744788	7748971	I'll come and do a Predicting the Future panel.
7748971	7751652	We need Matt there to be like, why this sucks panel.
7754681	7755702	Oh, all right, Rama.
7755702	7756582	It was a delight.
7756582	7759803	And I can't wait for the video footage out of Parsippany, New Jersey.
7759803	7761644	Yeah, we will be going.
7761644	7763865	And before I get out of here, Rob.
7763865	7764445	Yeah.
7764445	7768387	You are going to Galloping Ghosts, right?
7768387	7769027	Right.
7769027	7770808	What's the fuck is that?
7770808	7772988	What's Galloping Ghosts?
7772988	7776710	In Chicago, Galloping Ghosts Arcade.
7776710	7777710	No, I don't know the details.
7777710	7778771	I was like, is this
7779725	7780445	Big Arcade
7798310	7804434	They've had a lot of things there, Galloping Ghosts, but like, didn't they have like the Primal Rage 2 machine?
7804434	7804594	No.
7804594	7805794	Now that you guys are talking about this.
7805794	7808216	Yeah, they have a Primal Rage 2 machine that I saw it.
7808216	7808916	Okay.
7808916	7810717	And I sent Jamie.
7810717	7811718	It just clicked for me.
7811718	7813118	I have seen like the YouTube of this.
7813118	7814879	I didn't realize that was in Chicago.
7814879	7816981	It's outside of Chicago.
7816981	7820122	It takes about 20 minutes to get there by car.
7820122	7820823	Which might be hard.
7820823	7821363	I'm just saying.
7821363	7821763	We'll see.
7821763	7821983	We'll see.
7821983	7826446	Because I'm just saying, it's Ingress weekend and it's IML weekend.
7826446	7826706	But I
7827438	7829859	You know, we'll see.
7829859	7831699	It's huge.
7831699	7837300	I went in, I lost my partner and I lost my friend trying to find him so we can go out and eat.
7837300	7841981	And we ended up over at a building down the way where there's nothing but strictly pinball.
7841981	7842961	OK, I'll check it out.
7842961	7843421	We'll see.
7843421	7843761	We'll see.
7843761	7848402	I am there for a few days, so never say never.
7848402	7848822	Yes.
7848822	7856184	And I'm just saying, if it's the Leather Daddy convention or the arcade, I'm probably going to go to the one that's only one one weekend a year.
7857395	7861557	I mean, Rob, if it was me, I'd probably feel the same way, too.
7861557	7862697	Just saying.
7862697	7864298	Just saying.
7864298	7869060	Anyway, I mean, when I was there, I did get I did take I did see the Puli Lura machine.
7869060	7871761	I sent Jamie a picture of it.
7871761	7872821	Love it.
7872821	7873321	Mm hmm.
7873321	7875482	All right, Rob, I am letting you go.
7875482	7877883	Hmm.
7877883	7878043	What?
7879005	7879965	That was saying cool.
7879965	7880185	Cool.
7880185	7880485	All right.
7880485	7881586	Bye.
7881586	7882626	Bye.
7882626	7883286	Thank you, as always.
7883286	7883706	Take care, buddy.
7883706	7885187	All right.
7885187	7888268	Always a delight to hear from DJ Rama S here on this program.
7888268	7893950	But I think with that, we are going to let me check in one more time, see if Loki has any other last minute stories to talk about.
7893950	7895010	Oh, yes.
7895010	7896531	Yes, I do.
7896531	7898031	So this is a fun one.
7898031	7900112	Actually, there was a
7902330	7910800	a streamer that had commissioned this modder Snipsu to recreate Akuma Mode in Resident Evil 2.
7910800	7920612	Now Akuma Mode was something that was part of, and this is like a way back thing, a lot of kids may not remember this, EGM used to have like their game,
7922583	7940380	April Fools edition where they would have fake stories in there and one of the screenshots was you know Akuma mode in Resident Evil 2 you have to do all this like crazy stuff to be able to play as Akuma in the game well now you can and it's on ModDB if you're you want to check it out that's awesome
7941348	7943630	By the way, that is beautiful.
7943630	7953257	SSJ100 Matt piggybacking off the phone call we just had saying, Rob, if you want to know what the top 15 things to do in Parsippany, New Jersey is, there is a list.
7953257	7958380	And we actually have a list here from TripAdvisor has put together a list of the top things to do in Parsippany.
7958380	7965685	None of them have pictures, but they range from the top couple are a park to number four is the target.
7965685	7969949	Number four is going to Target and number six is going to Marshalls.
7972610	7976231	Even Mobile has more to do than that.
7976231	7978852	Why would you want to go to Marshall's over the spa?
7978852	7979793	Like, that's the thing.
7979793	7983755	Good fucking deals, Loki.
7983755	7986896	I mean, you go to you go to Marshall's to buy skincare and transformers.
7988871	7995142	What if I like, drove, or like, flew all the way to, you know, that city just for your marshals?
7995142	8000531	I heard that your target and marshals are among the to-do things in this town!
8002830	8006913	Why do I sound like Paul Lint just now?
8006913	8013437	Next time I go out to that part of the country, which has been a long time because I'm not at that job anymore that used to send me to Allentown.
8013437	8026885	But if I'm ever out in that part of the country ever again, I'm going to make it my goal to go to Parsippany, New Jersey, just to make that social media post that says, Hi, I'm in Parsippany.
8026885	8029767	Like in Waynesworld, we're in Delaware.
8029767	8030267	Delaware.
8034133	8036734	All right, on that note, we are ending the show.
8036734	8038194	I can't wait for the angry email.
8038194	8041194	I am a listener of yours and Parsippany, and I find it very rude.
8041194	8042435	All right.
8042435	8045915	No, it's more like we're going to get when they be like, you're correct.
8045915	8046815	Help.
8046815	8048476	We live in Sacramento, California.
8048476	8051256	We've been the butt of those kind of jokes for years and years and years.
8051256	8054957	The tagline of Sacramento is, hey, at least we're not Fresno.
8054957	8055397	Oh, come on.
8055397	8058758	Just try being from Alabama.
8058758	8060278	We're like, well, we ain't Mississippi.
8061479	8062780	All right, we're wrapping up.
8062780	8063840	We're trying.
8063840	8064660	That's it.
8064660	8066541	Thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
8066541	8069322	If you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, tell a friend or two about the show.
8069322	8074864	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
8074864	8079866	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it was that you found this podcast.
8079866	8082828	Those all go an awful long way.
8082828	8086569	We will be back in seven days to do this all over again.
8086569	8089870	Until then, DarkSakura, let's go to you with your final thought.
8089870	8091051	I know you're going to be streaming tonight.
8092054	8102537	I took your advice about my thing, and I am now sending you stickers that I have made of my avatar making weird faces.
8102537	8103077	Enjoy.
8103077	8105698	I saw that, and I reacted.
8105698	8106758	I sent you three more.
8106758	8107118	Oh, nice.
8107118	8108379	Okay, I'll look when I get a break.
8108379	8108659	Alright.
8109423	8109843	All right.
8109843	8110904	And Waffle House.
8110904	8111525	How can we forget?
8111525	8112265	Well, everyone.
8112265	8112946	OK.
8112946	8123795	Anyone who can get to a Waffle House and buy me two bags of grits from behind the counter, because the only way I can get those fuckers online is to order this big kit of shit.
8123795	8127218	I don't want to get one bag of grits.
8127218	8128399	Well, remind me.
8128399	8131621	Remind me next time I go to Atlanta.
8131621	8132862	I. All right.
8132862	8134444	Have a good night.
8134444	8134724	Bye.
8134724	8136005	Bye.
8136005	8138067	Well, that takes us to Loki and your final thought tonight.
8139327	8141250	LittleKittyBigCity no sprint button, button for zoomies
8150949	8164238	My final thoughts, speaking of little kitties, I don't mean to end on a downer, but I do want to let everybody know that Mr. Smush had a vet appointment and we found out that he has kidney disease, which is not a pleasant thing for a kitty to be going through.
8164238	8177487	It's still at a stage where we're hoping with some treatment through special food and potentially we're going to get evaluated this week to see if he could do IV liquid types of things to help, you know, sustain a quality of life or what have you.
8177487	8179749	We can do that for Mr. Smush, but
8180549	8182390	He still has a lot of his personality.
8182390	8183051	He's hanging in there.
8183051	8184552	He's just been drinking a lot of water.
8184552	8188374	And you know, there were signs in there that made us want to go to the vet and all of that.
8188374	8196580	But I know that he has been an icon of sorts for this show ever since we were together doing it at the house really ever since we got him in 2017.
8196580	8203865	So yeah, it's, you know, Alan and I are just kind of processing that and it sucks, but we're doing what we can.
8204765	8210809	Um, but I just want to let all of you know, um, cause you've shown him a lot of love over the years and he's a very famous cat because of all of you.
8210809	8213590	So I'll keep posting the pictures where I can.
8213590	8220534	Um, but yeah, just, uh, put some positive vibes out there in the universe and lots of virtual kitty treats, uh, for Mr. Smush.
8220534	8221935	I know he'd appreciate it.
8221935	8227779	So otherwise to try to end on a happier note, um, I look forward to seeing everybody again next week.
8227779	8232622	And I really look forward to vacation in two weeks cause there's nothing better in the world than vacation.
8233516	8234456	Have a good week, everybody.
8234456	8235197	We'll see you next time.
8235197	8236257	Happy gaming.
8236257	8240099	Bye.
