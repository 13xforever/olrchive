9810	10490	I played Rogue.
10750	11591	I don't know how I got it.
11631	12751	Maybe BBS downloads.
12932	13872	Yes, I'm old.
14192	15913	Rogue occupies a similar space as Doom.
16013	21736	Plenty of things replicated it, iterated on it, improved it, and its name turned into less of the game, but its conventions and meanings.
22036	23517	Like Doom, Rogue is back!
24057	25297	At least, the Amiga port is.
25658	26258	Now on the Switch.
26738	27679	I do miss the ASCII, though.
28059	29179	This is the Graveyard Intro.
29439	34102	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34262	36423	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39008	46175	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46315	48717	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48777	52761	We are back once again tonight, July 21st of 2024 with the 1011th, 11th, 11th?
57425	58767	1,000... It's almost a tongue twister.
58967	61309	These numbers are getting so high, it's a tongue twister.
61669	65032	The 1,011th episode of our show.
65473	72219	When I can talk correctly, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined each and every week, you hear over there, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
73120	73540	Hi.
74020	74961	Hello, how are you doing?
75862	76523	Frustrated.
76703	77103	Yeah, I know.
77143	83269	You're having camera issues tonight, so we have the static picture of one of your VTubes until we get the real thing back.
84315	91021	I do not know what's going on with my virtual cam, but I was trying to open it with Mac Family Tree.
91161	93783	I have no idea what's going on here.
93823	95465	I'm going to try to fix this business.
95485	100609	See, and here I thought Macs and Windows 3.1 was immune from everything that happened on Friday.
101230	102551	You and Southwest Airlines.
102711	106355	This has nothing to do with what happened on Friday.
106595	110738	This is just a completely different thing where it's set to open with the wrong...
111741	112542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
126758	127538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
147027	152891	I, you know, I've just had a month between the leg injury I talked about on the show previously and then I got really sick.
153091	166038	I had a really, really bad sore throat and get this, it went from being a sore throat to pink eye, like really bad viral, not bacterial, so eye drops didn't do anything, pink eye.
166859	170921	And then went from that to like all these other symptoms that just suck.
171321	171942	The weird thing
172762	173222	and DarkSakura.com.
189710	190511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
210729	215715	and I was feeling like 99% yesterday so really recovery couldn't come soon enough.
216036	216716	Was it COVID?
216837	217257	I don't know.
217317	217858	We'll never know.
217938	225687	I kind of feel like everything is COVID now especially when it's unexplainable symptoms that manifest in strange ways so...
226548	227188	It didn't matter.
227328	228209	I didn't go anywhere.
228369	229709	I was homebound for two days.
229809	233070	My poor Pikmin were not getting walked in Pikmin Bloom.
233450	234871	My Pokemon were not getting caught.
234911	235531	GoFest?
235671	236211	I don't know her.
236352	238252	I didn't do Pokemon GoFest this year at all.
238472	240113	I caught two Pokemon from my bed.
240453	241133	That's all I did.
241533	244374	So it was an adventure.
244414	245175	That's for damn sure.
245495	245715	Anyway.
246764	248065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
270922	272283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
295004	300005	Ironically, it's really good that I did not have plane tickets to go to Atlanta when I was sick.
300625	303546	So everything happens for a reason, I suppose.
304246	306607	But hopefully I'll be able to go next year or something.
306647	307307	I'd love to get back.
307367	310108	It's just, you know, DragonCon's going to happen every year.
311368	315469	It's hard to justify a second trip outside of that unless, like, your friend's getting married.
315549	316829	That's an easy one to justify.
317309	321730	Otherwise, convention, you know, it just kind of depends on what's going on.
321790	323051	So maybe every other year for that.
323091	323411	We'll see.
324031	325532	But hello to those of you in chat.
325612	330495	I always appreciate seeing your shining faces over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we tape live.
331495	331896	Let's see.
332896	336358	DJ Ranma S gives me a please know when I bring up what happened on Friday.
336779	337119	Sorry.
337379	338500	Thoughts and prayers, Ranma.
338540	339140	Thoughts and prayers.
339760	342162	Phil of Nine in chat says, protect yourself, Rob.
342202	343242	We're elderly now.
343342	343603	Yes.
344643	345303	Yes, we are.
346104	346944	There sure is.
348164	357408	So anyway, Rin Mari in chat says, TBH, I'm a little less hype for California Extreme because the usual providers for the rhythm games and shmups aren't going.
357808	360889	So I'll just have to enjoy pin and ball torture.
361469	364951	I've never heard of it called pin and ball torture, but I love that.
365751	369072	But DarkSakura, you are planning on a trip to California Extreme next weekend, right?
369932	370173	I am.
370553	371313	Yeah, that'll be fun.
372550	373171	A Bathtub A Bathtub
393081	415383	staying in a hotel with bathtub having the giant hotel bed the bathtub no the bathtub specifically because you know what my bathtub situation is like oh yeah yeah you're it's your cat yeah it's the cat the cat box lives in it yeah because it's the only room we have for it because a certain somebody will let me put a cat door on the laundry room door mm-hmm
416861	424645	So, um, and, uh, Rin, if you're going to be there, I mean, you can hang out at our hotel room.
424805	426446	I think I saw Orange Rites going too.
426586	430629	So, uh, there's a, there's a VOG party in DarkSakura's bathtub.
430669	431209	No, I'm just kidding.
431249	431549	I'm kidding.
431769	436512	No, but other than that, I really hope there's, um, a Nilton John.
437543	439265	Yes, I was seeing that pinball.
439285	443651	That was the first time I saw that pinball table was in the video footage Bobby was sharing on his show tonight.
443731	445133	That table looks fabulous.
445673	446715	That was like a great table.
448517	453083	But... Sorry, it's Dan that's being resistant.
454064	454785	But anyway...
457829	477879	I've played it before, I played it at California Extreme Not California Extreme, oh my god And by the way, I'm sorry if I'm messing up words I had a 12 hour subathon yesterday And my brain is broken and I just took migraine meds So if I'm out of it, that is why I am medicated to the eyeballs Anyway
479279	502575	yeah I want to see if they have the candy cabs there like Rin is saying because I want to play the shmups that I'm no good at plus there was a Sonic the Fighters there and I really had a lot of fun playing that and trashing whoever it was that was sitting on the opposite side of me that I couldn't see also
504850	507352	Just a few games in particular that I really hope to see.
507412	509773	I mean, there's all the ones that we see all the time anyway.
510434	517319	But I would like to... I think I might try to remember to bring some plug-in headphones so I can actually hear playing Beatmania.
517339	520261	And then...
522051	525732	I also... I need to get a new EMUs card, I think.
526092	528852	Or find my EMUs card, I should rather say.
530453	535793	And then... There's some other games that I would just like to see.
535833	537474	Some more Neo Geo stuff.
537734	542735	I've been having the wild urge to play Polestar and Blazing Star.
542755	549516	I mean, if I could find the cartridges for it, hell yeah, I'd be down.
551016	568146	I'd like to play Last Blade if they have one like Last Blade 2 in an arcade because I haven't played one of those in a while and if there's a Radiant Silvergun sign me the fuck up because last time I played that in an arcade was a DDR Freak trip to Las Vegas when we stayed at the Bellagio Fancy
570149	572870	No, I wasn't invited, but yes, I heard about the trip.
573210	574511	Well, you weren't a moderator.
574531	575131	I wasn't a moderator.
575251	577553	No, I was a flashy foot, but I wasn't a moderator.
578073	579414	Yeah.
579994	584557	But just a few things I think would be fun to play.
584577	587698	I apologize for the Windows startup noise.
587898	593962	I do not know how to turn off the sound alerts for my personal feed when we're doing this, so I apologize for that.
594062	595242	Windows, ugh.
595623	595903	I know.
596795	597936	I gave you a Mac!
598697	599297	Well, I didn't.
599657	600838	I enabled you to get a Mac.
600919	603160	It's kind of dated at this point, but yes.
604301	605002	Well, I mean.
606523	606944	Anyway.
608025	620815	And it was, you know, it was funny, all of, oh god, I can't say it without revealing anything, but a bunch of us in my group work on Macs.
621914	626902	And none of us knew what was going on until someone had actually checked CNN.
629426	632451	And we're like, oh, we didn't notice anything.
634758	636299	It was kind of funny.
655106	659051	and that is that the price of Xbox Game Pass is going to be changing.
660312	672007	And it's interesting because we knew that this was kind of rumored when we heard that Call of Duty, the big Activision title that Microsoft bought, Activision Blizzard,
672347	673068	Call of Duty Game Pass
701707	705010	That's going to go up from $17 a month to $20 a month.
705530	709213	And that's going to start, if you're new, that pricing already has taken effect.
709433	713276	It started back in July, the day after the email, or back on July 10th, the day after the email.
713816	719060	If you are not new or new, you're recurring, then that price is going to kick in in September.
719820	726205	But where this gets really weird is that there's going to be all of these other changes.
726445	726625	So
728810	741388	If this Xbox Ultimate doesn't work for you, then you can go to Xbox Game Pass for console, which is cheaper, but it doesn't have PC games and it doesn't have EA Play games, and that will be just $15 a month.
742910	745491	Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Console, Game Pass PC, Game Pass Standard
773440	778185	Game Pass for Matching Service, Game Pass EX2, The Vampire Hunter
791701	795002	Game Pass prepaid cards beyond 13 months.
795422	802944	So those of you that would stack the deal for like three years, five years at a time, and I know a lot of you did that some time ago, you can't do that anymore.
803024	804064	They're getting rid of that.
804544	808005	PC Game Pass, also getting price increase from $10 to $12.
808506	814987	Game Pass Core, which is another thing, which was originally Xbox Live Gold, which comes with a
817848	828009	But it still allows you to play the Xbox games online That goes up from $60 to $75 Messy, messy, messy, messy, messy And it doesn't make sense
829565	851768	and so I think this is a really silly plan for Xbox when they're trying to lean into more and more people being on the Game Pass platform and we're even hearing rumors and again they're rumors they should be taken with a grain of salt but that Microsoft plans to de-emphasize console sales in Europe in favor of Game Pass sales.
852762	870517	which is a little weird to me because the one decent way to deliver Game Pass sales is via a console so if you are de-emphasizing the console then that tells me you're only interested in emphasizing PC Game Pass which quite frankly at this point I'm thinking I'm going to switch to
871178	871879	within all this.
872319	883547	I'm right now a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, but I so rarely use my Xbox Series X, and with this price increase and everything, I'm kind of having to re-evaluate this, going, is this really worth it?
883908	884888	And honestly, no.
885028	888091	I pretty much only play stuff on PC Game Pass at this point.
888911	889312	If that.
889752	893935	I mean, I still use No Man's Sky, and I do check out things on PC Game Pass once in a while.
894315	897037	I would still think it'd be valuable for me to keep that, but...
899218	901721	This is way too confusing, Microsoft.
902162	903324	This has to be cleaned up.
904345	909292	You know, it was bad enough that we have the Series S and the Series X and all this.
909952	912716	You've got to break it down for the audience.
912916	913878	You've got to do things like...
914338	918881	Sure, you want to do like gold, silver, bronze or platinum, silver, gold, platinum.
918981	921763	Sure, people generally kind of understand that sort of thing.
922324	930409	Or, you know, you want to do different tiers or like with A, B, C tier, 1, 2, 3 tier, something like that.
930609	931990	That would make a lot more sense.
932250	939215	But Ultimate, Console, PC, Core, Standard, it's too much.
939955	940736	This doesn't make sense.
942793	944633	DarkSakura, you don't use Game Pass at all, right?
945334	945974	Nope.
946194	947114	So what the hell, right?
947874	948094	Right.
948354	957857	Well, and then there's the cloud thing too, but I think that's just kind of... Some of those Game Pass I mentioned, I couldn't tell you which ones also include the cloud gaming, which is a thing.
959637	961718	I think that it's a big clusterfuck.
962662	964323	It is a big clusterfuck.
964423	970146	Clawstorm in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, Game Pass doesn't seem good for indie devs.
970707	976950	Microsoft wants to cast a giant net over the budget consumer market by using their massive capital to offer $60 games for free.
978591	984197	Who's gonna buy a $5 unproven game when 100 AAA titles are under the Monopoly subscription umbrella?
984618	997712	You know, Clawstorm, though, I've actually heard that Game Pass is actually pretty good for elevating a lot of indie games because if you, like, look at what's on the service now and look how many day one games they're really offering right now.
998212	999654	It isn't as many as you'd think.
1000034	1000575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1023298	1037142	and there have been some interesting studies that have been done that show that even if somebody isn't buying a game on Game Pass per se, their friend will buy it because of word of mouth from that person who originally bought it.
1037582	1042604	So I think for some indie devs, the ones that get in on Game Pass, it does actually work out pretty well.
1042664	1046025	Keep in mind, a lot of those games only stay on the service for a year
1046385	1047245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1072136	1096024	but I do understand what you're saying about the whole like when you have a buffet of games available for free are you going to be tempted to buy five dollar games but I do think the marketplace has shown there has been room again for some success now you know because I could bring games like Stardew Valley or Vampire Survivors or Among Us that were very cheap very big games but
1096164	1110652	but I also realized for every one of those games I named there are a thousand indie games that don't get discovered at all so I'm not going to say your point is without merit but I'm not sure that I would go so far as to say that Game Pass is necessarily bad for indie devs
1112032	1115816	Clawstorm says, this is true as long as you agree to join the Microsoft side.
1115956	1119599	Agree or disappear is how I see it as an indie dev myself.
1119739	1120460	Great point though.
1120620	1121061	Fair enough.
1122302	1122702	Let's see.
1123123	1126286	Rinmari says, I kind of have a bone to pick with vampire survivors.
1126406	1128227	I'm a little bit curious more about that.
1129048	1133251	Unless that's a pun because like Bone, Castlevania, I'll forget it.
1133271	1134392	SG100Matt says,
1149562	1152765	That's a really good point.
1153966	1165275	And maybe, you know, especially when you consider the Costco discount, which I like to kind of put out there and, you know, I'm not a shill for Costco, but if I hear of another store doing something similar, I will happily promote it as well.
1165895	1168237	But if you go to Costco, you can get $100 worth of Xbox cards for $90.
1170959	1176381	So you're saving a little bit right there, and then you use that to buy the stacking, and there you go.
1176461	1180583	You can kind of, you know, stretch the savings a little bit further.
1181063	1182123	So something to think about.
1182863	1197409	I see Renmari on Vampire Survivor says, It was the centerpiece of Steam's Shmup Fest, which showcased a lot of games that were not conventional shmups, while games that were genuinely shmups got rejected for not apparently representing the genre, such as Terra Flame.
1197709	1198209	Interesting.
1198269	1199930	I was not aware of the whole Steam thing.
1200250	1201391	All of that stuff going on there.
1224085	1225586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1254405	1260367	when said big company is led by Bobby Kotick, one of the most toxic individuals in the entire gaming industry.
1261387	1261587	Growl.
1261667	1262607	Yeah, bark, bark, bark.
1262867	1263987	This needed to happen.
1264328	1268729	So I kind of am like, FTC, investigate Bobby Kotick or back off.
1269329	1271829	Like, that's where you need to be looking.
1272570	1274110	So I kind of let this go.
1274830	1280472	But now the FTC is back and I'm a little bit like, okay, I'm kind of curious where this leads.
1281272	1281472	So
1282712	1286797	The FTC has come out and said they wrote in a letter to the U.S.
1286857	1295889	appeals court and said this is, quote, exactly the sort of consumer harm that they were worried about with the Activision acquisition.
1295989	1297230	So this is going to the U.S.
1297290	1297991	appeals court.
1298332	1301055	And now this letter is talking about the price hike.
1301435	1306079	and points out about the $3 price increase and so forth.
1306139	1308441	There's a whole letter that's out there if you want to read.
1309562	1311243	It's very interesting.
1312424	1313224	It's kind of short.
1313304	1314986	For a legal document, it's pretty short.
1315066	1328937	It's only two pages, but they say as part of this, Microsoft's price increases and product degradation combined with Microsoft's reduced investments and output and product quality via employee layoffs.
1329597	1333590	are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.
1335310	1335550	Uh-oh.
1362890	1377281	Microsoft's post merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminary halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm's economic incentives.
1378081	1393109	This could get very interesting because when you look at that letter and that phrasing and the fact they bring in the receipts, they're saying Microsoft testified, COD available, no price increase.
1394790	1396051	Those receipts are there.
1397191	1401193	But at the same time, what the fuck can they realistically do at this point?
1401313	1403955	People have been laid off and found new jobs.
1405253	1410177	I mean, if you want to get technical, can the government come in and split up a company?
1411058	1411719	Yes, they can.
1412680	1416743	Could the government come in and split up Microsoft by force?
1417504	1418225	Yes, they could.
1418885	1419646	Would it be pretty?
1419666	1422168	If they can prove there's a hard monopoly.
1422649	1422829	Yeah.
1424946	1425426	I don't know.
1429487	1430208	Get your popcorn.
1430668	1431188	This could be good.
1431588	1432968	I don't know.
1432988	1439410	I try to do the predicting and forecasting a lot on here, but when it comes to the government, I can't fucking predict shit.
1441970	1446171	Especially on today, July 21st, 2024.
1447292	1451233	I'm done trying to predict what the fuck's going on in this country anymore.
1451373	1451933	I'm done.
1453498	1456782	I just need to sit back.
1457303	1462030	I need to just let them do their thing and let me know when to come back and take a look.
1462251	1463793	Yeah, that's where I'm at.
1463833	1464414	That's where I'm at.
1465539	1469923	Anyway, so that's kind of the new thing that happened this week is the FTC getting on board.
1470003	1472325	So this is not over.
1472445	1474867	This is far from being over.
1475808	1477169	So we'll see what happens next.
1477570	1485536	All right, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it was Call of Duty or through Xbox Game Pass or not.
1485857	1486998	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1488175	1512686	I had experiences this week not just having to do with my subathon which I will get to that in a second because I know you want to know about the fork and the knife not necessarily a plate the bowl and the spoon just saying or the sippy cup that's right I want to know about Ariana Grande's adventures in Fortnite well that outfit I showed you I actually bought today because it's the one I wish I could have bought yesterday so you played Fortnite again today
1513604	1517645	No, I just loaded it up long enough to get the outfit and then lug out.
1517965	1520186	But I did play for... Okay, I'll just get to it.
1520226	1520466	Fuck.
1520826	1521086	All right.
1521986	1524487	I played a lot of fucking Dead by Daylight yesterday.
1524687	1527528	If we've learned anything today, folks, bullying works.
1529188	1529729	Just kidding.
1530149	1531249	I never bully people.
1531289	1531949	I'm just joking.
1532009	1534950	But I'm saying that very tongue, very firmly planted in cheek.
1535670	1537051	Played four games of Fortnite.
1537451	1537751	Okay.
1538784	1543007	I played with Ryan, who is Shayla's boyfriend.
1544268	1547651	And I played with my friend Smokey, another one of my DVD buddies.
1548692	1550073	And we did four matches.
1550313	1551454	We won three of them.
1554636	1557198	I have learned that I love sniping.
1558840	1563663	I like to be up in high places and look down upon my enemies as I rain death.
1565204	1566445	We also had a bus.
1566465	1566645	Tracks.
1568809	1577700	I said tracks we also managed to get a murder bus which we killed all the NPCs to acquire and I was blowing up buildings and that was pretty funny
1579938	1583859	and blowing up people at point-blank range with a grenade launcher.
1584299	1585100	That was also really fun.
1588161	1591742	It brought out the worst in me and I was very happy to have that outlet.
1593342	1595423	It was a lot of fun.
1595463	1597543	It was a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
1597803	1600384	I didn't really start off motion sick.
1600504	1603385	I got a little headachy after a few games.
1604785	1606286	Sorry, it's the meds.
1607552	1619151	So, um, yeah, it was, uh, it was, uh, pretty, pretty fun, I'll admit, and it was a redeem from Last Subathon.
1620137	1641313	so I got it out of my system and who knows I might play it again but not unless I have other people to play with I bought the Kitane character the first time I made my account and everything and then when I went in yesterday there was this Ariana Grande skin that had this fucking dragon armor and I'm like, bitch
1642918	1667479	I am hot as fuck in this fucking dragon armor for fuck's sake so I have the dragon armor and then I bought the other outfit I guess it was her first one but it has these crystals and shit on it in the dark mode or something and I'm like, I like this too so I have that and it's really funny to watch her with a guitar rocking out to Master of Puppets
1668851	1671153	because I did buy the Master of Puppets emote.
1673034	1675736	So it was hilarious.
1675856	1678138	And what was funny is that all three of us had it.
1678839	1683182	So we were like a three-person band because it's one of those four-people emotes.
1684603	1687606	So all of us were doing the Master of Puppets thing.
1687966	1690128	We had our guitar, our bass, and a drummer.
1690168	1691629	We just didn't have our lead.
1694640	1700066	I would really love to do a Clueless Fortnite stream with you, because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in that game.
1700346	1701667	I don't know what the fuck I'm doing either.
1701807	1702888	Exactly, Clueless Fortnite.
1703289	1711777	I know Fortnite Festival, that I can do, and Fortnite Lego, but Battle Royale, I'd love to play just for the lols, to be honest.
1711837	1740603	I want to try the Lego mode and there's also there's like a fuck ton of modes like there's like RP modes and exploration modes and escape rooms and all kinds of shit they go they go to fucking town man town and uh but I did actually get like three songs for uh for festival yeah so uh do you want to guess what they are
1741610	1745934	I haven't seen the song update list in a long time, so I would really have to guess.
1746635	1748217	So I've got my Happy Driving song.
1749258	1750499	Are any of them Gaga songs?
1751240	1751540	Yes.
1751820	1752981	Yay, then you picked correctly.
1753021	1753402	Good job.
1754543	1755364	You want to guess which one?
1755804	1757166	It's my favorite Gaga song.
1758367	1760669	And it's not Shiza.
1760809	1761670	So Happy I Could Die?
1762711	1763892	No, it's Rain On Me.
1764493	1765474	Okay, that is a good song.
1766400	1773886	So I have Rain On Me, I have Into You, because that was the only Ariana Grande song on there that I thought was really, that I really liked the best.
1774006	1774606	I like that song too.
1775948	1781412	And then, although I would like No Tears Left To Cry, because that actually is my favorite Ariana Grande song.
1781512	1782192	Actually, I take that back.
1782252	1783293	Focus is my favorite.
1783674	1785775	I love the new one that sounds like a Robin song.
1785895	1787657	It sounds just like a Robin song.
1788537	1789258	I'll have to check it out.
1789518	1791259	I can't even remember the name of the song.
1791279	1791360	Okay.
1792401	1795483	because I'm old and I don't know new music anymore.
1795984	1796524	Stop it!
1797725	1800107	You're not allowed to say that because then that means I'm older.
1803530	1809414	And then I have BTS Dynamite because that's like the one BTS song I like and it makes me happy.
1809735	1810035	That's it.
1810075	1810695	Thank you, Garth.
1810896	1811816	We can't be friends.
1812157	1812737	That's the one.
1813858	1814639	Okay.
1814679	1818522	It's nice to know that Garth the Wolf will be bringing me meals when I'm too old.
1819663	1821224	Rob, stop!
1822369	1822690	That's it.
1822750	1824553	We Can't Be Friends is the song I was trying to think of.
1824593	1826417	Rob, stop it.
1830821	1838543	No, Brad, you just don't don't don't do not don't dot com slash org for matching service.
1839884	1841324	Anything else for your game?
1842644	1844365	Yes, and this is a big something.
1844985	1848566	And so I cannot say what it was I played.
1849286	1850947	It was a closed beta.
1851807	1852707	That's all I can say.
1853927	1854848	I might tell you privately.
1855628	1856228	However,
1857379	1885160	I got to try a tool that incorporates game porting kit for Mac without me having to jump through all the hoops of the developer console and blah blah I mean I've got the developer access and all that I can do all of that but I got an app called Whiskey and I was able to load up my beta software just fine
1886377	1888938	ran with no fucking problems at all.
1890939	1897761	And it's W-H-I-S-K-Y and podculture, if you're spelling it that way, you need an H in there.
1897941	1899642	Just saying.
1899922	1901682	But it's a great tool.
1901762	1908305	Basically, it uses sort of like a wine environment and aspects of the game porting kit.
1909918	1914361	to basically convert all the DirectX stuff to metal.
1915121	1917843	And it runs the game like it was a fucking native app.
1918664	1919904	It's so smooth.
1919924	1922786	I had zero problems.
1923506	1924007	Interesting.
1924027	1925307	I'm kind of curious what it was now.
1925327	1928389	And I tested it on non-beta stuff.
1929430	1930370	I played What the Fog.
1932532	1933712	It was perfect.
1935693	1936414	I also...
1937725	1942708	have run the app that I use to rip the Dead by Daylight files.
1945169	1946030	And it runs.
1947150	1949952	My YouFinder app, it runs.
1951092	1951373	So...
1953295	1967963	I'm going to see now if I can use it to get my Dead by Daylight files again so I can go back to my character creation because I'm also in the middle of learning how to take the clothes out of
1970259	1980045	Blender, like to separate them from the models and then incorporate them into Daz3D so I can make like outfits for Machinima and whatever things that I want to do.
1980085	1985669	So it's actually really opened a creative door for me that had been closed since I decided to stop paying for Parallels.
1987590	1990272	And I mean, it'll, it'll
1991417	1999444	I'll have to try some other apps, like see if I can find some PC-only stuff and give it a go.
1999564	2000605	I mean, they do have to be 64-bit.
2002421	2025929	but I might try it on some other games like I'm trying to think I have a bunch of PC games that if they're not on GeForce Experience I can't play them and this is kind of opened me back up this means that Mac gaming is alive and well and can thrive you don't need to have those other resources although I still like my um
2027049	2041666	my GeForce experience but I'm going to try to see if I can run Dead by Daylight on it and if I can or Fortnite or something else the advantage to GeForce experience means that I don't have to locally install my games
2042819	2064294	um really quickly before we get to my gaming week um talking about like cloud gaming and dead by daylight and all that stuff i couldn't help but think of you when they announced that finally finally in dead by daylight cross progression is coming and i think it's tomorrow um which means that when i was on stadia all the purchase yeah all the purchases you made on stadia can finally come up except you probably bought most of it again already well they refunded me
2064594	2065154	Oh, that's right.
2065255	2065615	They did.
2065875	2067536	So I had to rebuy them anyway.
2067616	2072059	Although what was funny is that here I am getting like all these oodles.
2072139	2075622	And I think some of it was like some of the games, the full games I paid for.
2076462	2077823	But I got all this money back.
2079024	2086710	And then I only ended up paying like at the time like $175 for my missing DLC.
2088031	2090572	But I kept... The thing is that they didn't...
2092828	2118184	they didn't make me rebuy my cosmetics it was just the DLC interesting yeah the thing that I wish would happen now if it happens to load up all of my achievements fuck yes I'm very curious about that too the first thing I'm going to do is launch it on Playstation and see what happens if my Steam achievements come over I'll be very interested in that
2118493	2131862	The problem, though, is that, and this is what was explained to me, is that achievements are like for service-based, I guess, since they're all wrapped into that specific service.
2133603	2140628	So, and on top of that, I mean, I don't know if Google still has any of their Stadia servers active for stuff like that.
2141068	2141168	Hmm.
2141388	2168250	so that may be a factor as well I've been busting my ass trying to regain some of them although I need to get back on my hardcore killer playing to get most of the ones that I have I've gotten a bunch more than I had before and I'm actually pretty happy that because I had used free GeForce experience once for when I was linking my Steam version
2170110	2172612	Way back before I had to move to Steam full-time.
2173212	2176555	So I linked that and my P350s did sync over.
2177456	2178017	Interesting.
2178117	2184983	So I at least have my P350 showing on there, which is, I think, the only legacy achievement that is on there.
2186964	2191947	I'm curious to see what happens with that cross-progression tomorrow because that's a pretty big deal for that game.
2192327	2198351	I originally played it, ironically, on Game Pass and so I actually had some DLC that was only on Xbox.
2198791	2204735	I ended up re-buying it on Steam but I guess I get a certain amount of shards for having the same thing twice.
2204795	2205615	It'll be interesting to see.
2205656	2211299	It'll be also interesting just to have all my stuff on PlayStation because I actually like playing the game on PlayStation.
2211339	2214041	It runs very smooth and the controller is very nice so we'll see.
2214121	2214361	We'll see.
2215066	2234049	well I messaged you what it was I played but don't say anything okay of course um let's see my gaming week so um a lot of Final Fantasy 14 of course what else is new because Dawn Trail is still relatively new I did beat Dawn Trail uh recently I think before I guess I talk about it on the show yet because it might have happened the week we didn't end up doing a show but I did beat Dawn Trail
2234589	2236010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2255168	2281314	is rough I think story-wise the first half of the expansion is rough but once you get into the second half it is incredible especially once again they really knocked it out of the park with the last zone and I think at the end of the day the battle content like the dungeons and all that are very very it's literally the best it's ever been as when you get to the dungeons and the actual battle content which is the stuff you're actually replaying so I'll get I'm gonna give it to them on that
2282254	2285677	Um, so otherwise it hasn't left me time for a lot of new games.
2285717	2292102	I've still been doing a little bit of Diablo 4 because I still do want to finish this season, but I did play one brand new game, brand, brand new game.
2292622	2300908	It's been a while since I've talked about a new Switch game, but that Nintendo World Championship NES edition came out on Friday.
2300948	2301088	Yeah.
2301108	2305612	You've been, uh, you're talking about Dan, uh, playing that and I've been playing that as well.
2306112	2310095	I forgot it came out until I saw Bobby Blackwolf streaming it on Friday.
2310195	2310775	And I was like, Oh,
2311596	2312637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2328839	2330661	It's cute.
2331142	2332923	It's basically NES Remix.
2333103	2333744	It really is.
2333824	2335145	It just doesn't remix anything.
2335566	2341511	But it's playing the games in short bursts and kind of focusing on the speedrun element.
2342031	2354462	My only concern is that if they don't refresh these challenges or add to the challenges or do some of these things a little more often, I'm afraid the game is going to wear out its welcome pretty quick.
2355063	2357024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2384757	2387518	Over maybe 10 classic NES games each.
2387918	2389178	A really rough estimate.
2389698	2396780	That is like, okay, in some games it's... So like for Mario 1, grab the mushroom as fast as you can.
2397320	2398741	Which is like a 4 second challenge.
2399501	2403122	Or it might be beat World 1-1 as fast as you can.
2403182	2404863	Which is a little bit meatier of a challenge.
2405143	2408103	But still, it's actually only about a 30 second challenge.
2408283	2410484	I think my time was actually down to like 26 seconds.
2410864	2413205	Because beating World 1-1, speedrunning it...
2414005	2418687	You really just... You don't fuck around with mushrooms, coins, or anything.
2418727	2419948	You go start to finish.
2420508	2434535	So I do like that they're kind of putting that speedrun element on it, especially when Awesome Games Done Quick and Summer Games Done Quick and those speedrunning sorts of events have such large fanbases and fans that it's been getting speedrunning more popular.
2435056	2436837	This does feel like it's kind of like a...
2437757	2441059	Why don't you learn how to speedrun certain elements of games?
2441359	2452907	Because these challenges start small, but spoiler alert, because I got so many coins from playing some of the... I had to play that gold level challenge over and over and over until I beat it.
2453267	2460272	Because they do this knockout challenge where it's like, you know, you have eight players, and then you get four players, then you have two players, then you have one.
2460592	2463294	And then the gold level, it's actually kind of difficult.
2463334	2465135	It took me several tries to beat it.
2465676	2467197	But I had so many coins from that,
2468037	2484929	I unlocked every challenge in Mario Brothers Super Mario Brothers just to see what is the last challenge is the last challenge speedrun the entire fucking game and guess what spoiler alert yes it is the very last challenge is speedrun the entire fucking game
2485769	2511806	so I wonder and what's interesting is that they actually do like a little help screen that actually you can it it shows you here are some tricks here are where the warp zones are I think everybody knows this by now but maybe maybe not maybe you're one of these gamers that wasn't born yet during the original NES championships as the opening credits of the game it kind of acknowledged that many many Nintendo fans weren't born yet when the first world championships happened
2512606	2513607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2536053	2538216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2555936	2558018	So I thought that was very interesting.
2558499	2561381	So I do hope they keep adding to it.
2561521	2566866	I hope there's a Super Nintendo version at some point, even though that wasn't really part of the original World Championships.
2566906	2567427	But you know what?
2567807	2571911	This game has fuck all to do with the original championships.
2571991	2576215	And it's probably because the Tetris rights are kind of in a weird place.
2576335	2580319	I'm not sure Nintendo could put out the original NES Tetris again.
2580719	2580980	Well...
2581860	2583601	They did the Game Boy version, didn't they?
2584241	2585022	So maybe they could.
2585062	2586742	I'm not sure how the rights issues work out.
2587683	2591565	Well, then Rad Racer was a Square Enix game, so they would need to have Square Enix on board.
2591625	2596287	But shit, if they could get them on board, it would be fun to do the original cartridge run, if they could do it.
2597227	2597427	Yeah.
2597868	2597988	Yeah.
2598588	2599008	Be interesting.
2599288	2600949	But anyway, that was the other big game I played this week.
2601329	2603910	DarkSakura, you said you've been kind of watching Dan play a little bit.
2603970	2605091	Any thoughts from watching Dan?
2606552	2607432	It's not really my jam.
2608933	2609433	I don't like...
2610171	2610551	DarkSakura,
2631354	2631834	It's cool.
2632175	2634717	I'll watch people play it and I'm glad they're enjoying it.
2634777	2637199	It's just not my cup of tea.
2637659	2638180	Not mine.
2638220	2638760	That's fair.
2638820	2640201	Not every video game has to be.
2640742	2647007	Yeah, I enjoy it and I like that it's not live with other players because it takes a lot of the pressure off, I think.
2647067	2648568	It's only using ghost recordings.
2649008	2652391	It's weird to think, are my ghost recordings showing up in other people's games?
2652631	2654573	That's the weird thing for me to think about.
2655393	2658195	But what I do, I now have a new dream game.
2658215	2658716	Okay.
2660074	2662095	I want it to be called Slow Running.
2664335	2679120	Where the whole point of it is to get as distracted as humanly possible and find Easter eggs everywhere and break boundaries and find stuff that's behind the thing and just call it rabbit hole.
2679320	2679600	Okay?
2679680	2680320	Call it rabbit hole.
2680760	2682622	That's just Thursday night gaming at my house.
2683623	2686526	Well, I mean, like the shit I used to do in World of Warcraft.
2686746	2687827	Yeah, no, I get it, I get it.
2688448	2691431	Garth the Wolf in chat says, ghost recording like Mario Kart ghosts?
2691531	2692452	Kind of, yeah, same concept.
2692472	2696356	Yeah, you're constantly going against ghosts in the World Championship game.
2696456	2697578	Either it's your own ghost...
2698278	2701960	Which, you know, when you're kind of grinding the regular base challenges, that's what it is.
2702240	2703521	Or it's other players' ghosts.
2703981	2708163	When you're doing like the gold championships and stuff, you're not racing against people live.
2708443	2710083	You're racing against their ghost recordings.
2710424	2713345	So they do pull it off pretty well with that considered.
2713385	2714506	But it's interesting.
2714886	2715026	So...
2715706	2717387	I mean, it's only 20 bucks.
2717527	2720208	And so for that price, I'm like, all right, that's a fine price.
2720748	2723670	I understand there was a physical edition that was much more money than that.
2724090	2731373	And that just really depends on as far as I'm concerned, that is your affection for those types of physical products and keepsakes.
2731814	2734995	If that is for you, then that's going to be the value there.
2735115	2739717	For me, I have to work on collecting less of that kind of stuff and not more.
2740137	2742499	So I bypassed the physical version and just got the digital.
2743079	2743179	So...
2745356	2753064	Yeah, Garth the Wolf in chat says, Nintendo, while they fail at online implementation most of the time, I appreciate the cute ways they do it sometimes.
2753324	2754385	That's a good way to sum it up.
2754625	2755186	It is cute.
2755506	2756868	I like the cute way they did it here too.
2758109	2758369	All right.
2759504	2765606	That's our Gaming Weeks, so let's get into some other gaming news and talk about what few headlines there are this week.
2766106	2771188	But hey, lucky me, one of our first headlines tonight has to do with a game I play a lot.
2771688	2772708	I love this game.
2773048	2774729	It's been going for eight years now.
2774769	2776549	It's the game No Man's Sky.
2776969	2782151	And No Man's Sky has just updated with their Worlds Part 1 update.
2782551	2788633	So in the Worlds Part 1 update, which I love that it's Part 1, which indicates there's going to be another...
2788993	2789754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2813132	2835289	looks phenomenal now it actually looks like water should kind of look like instead of like just like a flat thing it's this almost looks like avatar it's oh it's so good DarkSakura I love this game so much and it's only aged like a real fine wine over the last two years what's that that reminded me of the other thing I played but that was just the new avatar DLC which is gorgeous fair enough so fair enough anyway
2836181	2837723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2851604	2854885	There's a brand new expedition that's very bug-inspired.
2855425	2858146	It's like a Starship Troopers kind of tongue-in-cheek sort of thing.
2858586	2861127	I actually could kind of give or take the expedition at this point.
2861247	2865528	I used to be a big fan, but the rewards have kind of dried up a little bit in those expeditions to me.
2866068	2868049	You actually see a little bit of that in this video right now.
2868069	2873530	Pew, pew, pew against this giant bug, which this does not look like the same game that came out eight years ago.
2874251	2877252	It's just wild that they continue to update this game and not charge for it.
2877272	2878452	But the weather looks great.
2878852	2881573	There's just a lot that looks really good in this game.
2881673	2887395	So if you have a dusty old copy of No Man's Sky sitting in there somewhere, you really should check out what they've changed in this game over the years.
2887435	2888255	It's pretty incredible.
2888615	2894057	And there's a lot of people out there that are like, honestly, Sean Murray, Hello Games, let us give you money.
2895357	2904004	and they don't charge for this because I think to some extent they still feel this need to make up for the promises that happened eight years ago.
2904604	2911590	I think most gamers have forgiven Sean Murray and we see I think the most important thing
2912350	2914111	is changed behavior, right?
2914632	2918415	Is that it's one thing to say sorry, but it's another to show changed behavior.
2919035	2920817	And look at what's happening with Light No Fire.
2921337	2925100	They have had that initial trailer and they haven't said shit about it since.
2926161	2930424	And that has changed behavior to me, especially if you look at what happened for No Man's Sky.
2930744	2940031	Now, we still got a long ways to go until that game is out, but I have this funny feeling at some point they're just going to be like, Light No Fire comes out next week.
2940291	2940572	Enjoy.
2942203	2944084	and I'm really excited for it.
2944104	2948546	And I see some of you in chat are actually going like, yeah, I'm hyped for No Man's Fire.
2949366	2952107	Yeah, Clawstorm says, excited for Hello Games new title.
2953268	2959290	Yeah, Garth Wolf says, man, I wish it was more of a game for me because I bounced off it, but visually it looks incredible.
2959590	2962752	Well, I'm sure it's always willing to welcome you back if you want.
2963112	2965753	So Fifth Dream says, most of the improvements came last
2966033	2967174	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2995020	2996061	I don't disagree.
2996321	2998723	However, here's that reverse problem.
2999423	3014073	With No Man's Sky, we had the developers and Sony hyping up this game a little too much and talking about some things that were there in their minds, like conceptually they were there, but physically they were not there.
3014433	3016815	And we all know that No Man's Sky launched that way.
3017135	3018095	It was a little messy.
3019096	3022338	I didn't hate the game when it first came out, but I didn't buy into the hype.
3022879	3024260	Very dangerous thing to do, right?
3025040	3026361	But I love the game now.
3026621	3031564	They've obviously, you know, it's not fair to look at No Man's Sky under the lens of like eight years ago.
3031604	3033005	It's a very, very, very different thing now.
3033526	3038929	What I mean by the opposite problem and with that comment that Clawstorm said is that we need to be careful.
3039830	3045453	So the change behavior is that Sean Murray is now shutting the fuck up and not hyping this game beyond his control.
3046194	3048095	We need to be careful to not do that.
3049556	3052478	We need to not hype this game up beyond control.
3052978	3053919	So we're just going to
3056213	3061615	We're going to give our golf applause at the trailer and go, yes, that is a lovely trailer for Light No Fire.
3061655	3063336	Yes, very well splendid indeed.
3063676	3065297	I can't wait to see what you all come up with.
3065637	3074681	And then we all need to do them a big favor and shut the fuck up until the game comes out and just allow the experience to be what it is.
3075581	3077062	I say that very tongue-in-cheek.
3077102	3085609	Of course, you're allowed to talk about it and so forth, but I'm just saying we just need to be careful about the hype machine, not to fill in for what Sean Murray is not doing this time.
3085950	3089733	Ooh, I love the way QuestBuster phrases this.
3090133	3094757	It was as wide as an ocean, but as shallow as a puddle on lunch.
3095297	3096018	On lunch.
3096218	3096939	God damn it.
3101178	3102439	A bitch is hungry, okay?
3103240	3104841	It was as wide... Let's start again.
3105922	3112347	QuestBuster says, It was as wide as an ocean, but as shallow as a puddle on launch.
3113368	3119793	I didn't hate them for it, but disappointed there wasn't more, especially after getting to the center of the galaxy and getting New Game+.
3120313	3120474	Yeah.
3120674	3123296	But obviously, eight years, a lot has fucking changed.
3123676	3125798	If you haven't visited No Man's Sky in a long time...
3127093	3127633	Fucking do it.
3127813	3128994	You really owe it to yourself to do it.
3129114	3130394	It's on Game Pass, by the way.
3131474	3137496	And I think it's on just about every configuration of Game Pass there is, save the maybe the basic core one.
3137636	3140257	So, you know, if you're a Game Pass person, it's there.
3140357	3142138	I think it's on PlayStation Plus as well.
3142518	3142938	I think.
3143398	3144138	Don't quote me on that.
3144178	3146199	But yeah, there's going to be a lot of ways to check that out.
3146379	3150100	Or it's on sale all the time for 20 bucks on one of the storefronts.
3150160	3150820	So keep an eye out.
3150900	3152521	If it's not 20 bucks yet, it will be.
3152601	3153301	Wait for the next sale.
3155353	3157034	Alright, let's move on.
3157114	3159395	Let's talk about, this is exciting news as well, right, DarkSakura?
3163037	3163337	Yes.
3165098	3168199	What's more exciting, this news or the cookie that you're currently eating?
3168479	3170100	I'm not eating a cookie, I'm eating a burger.
3170681	3171341	Oh, even better.
3173328	3174449	I need meat.
3174489	3177511	I thought you were just going to talk a whole bunch more.
3177671	3178792	No, I've said enough.
3179512	3180293	But I will say this.
3180353	3183875	Clawstorm in chat says on sale right now on Steam for $24.
3184395	3184956	So there you go.
3184976	3186056	That's a pretty good price.
3186897	3189959	I've had the game for like ever and I haven't even...
3191192	3191432	Good, good.
3217925	3219586	Orange on Studio.
3219606	3221486	Next story.
3221506	3222106	There's good news.
3225127	3230649	Bethesda, their workers have come together.
3231009	3247214	241 developers, artists, engineers, programmers, designers and they have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal and Microsoft recognized it.
3248684	3272851	so they are they're unioned they've come together for collective bargaining and I think that that's wonderful there's not a whole bunch more about it um but this is good news we're seeing they're they're joining the communication workers of America yay we need more we need more
3273700	3296726	Yeah it's uh you know especially that we're hearing now more of these bigger studios are trying to like Bethesda that's a pretty big deal um so I think we're really just going to see more and more of this uh this is this is a train that is not going to be able to be stopped in the industry uh and I think a lot of you know and Microsoft kind of is accepted this uh I think at this point so I'm glad it sort of enables Bethesda to be able to do this this is good so.
3299143	3303806	Clawstorm in chat says Vault 124 is going to be filled with Bethesda employees that unionized.
3305006	3305466	No.
3306567	3318733	But they... But I mean, if you think about like there's ZeniMax and TenderClaws and Sega and Blizzard and all kinds.
3318793	3324956	So I'm really happy to see that people are pushing this forward and I'm hoping to see...
3326858	3331063	See it widespread, not just in video games, but in tech in general.
3331424	3333046	Yeah, no, good thing, good thing.
3334335	3334575	All right.
3334615	3348241	Well, speaking of other Microsoft studios, and you mentioned Blizzard in there, some big news on another game that I follow quite a bit, which is Diablo 4, a game that has really just been also been aging pretty well in its short span.
3348621	3354283	Although I think a lot of us are still kind of like, does it need an expansion just one year after the release of the original game?
3354383	3356724	But there's a lot of interesting things coming.
3357024	3359885	And of course, I mean, is it a question if I'm going to buy it?
3359925	3360725	Of course, I'm going to buy it.
3360805	3361666	Maybe I'm the problem.
3361786	3361986	But
3362566	3365487	This new class that they're adding into the game does look pretty cool.
3365547	3367167	It's called the Spiritborn.
3367527	3373328	And some are saying it's a little bit of Diablo 3's Monk meets Diablo 3's Witch Doctor, which sounds like fun to me.
3373729	3375529	The Spiritborn was unveiled this week.
3375649	3381610	Now, I should clarify, we knew the Spiritborn was coming from the original launch trailer.
3381950	3384691	We just know what it is and how it plays now.
3385171	3406108	and so the detail we got is that it is a dexterity driven class and it uses spirit guardians four of them and you can use those powers in combat there's a jaguar with fire damage there's an eagle with lightning damage the gorilla gives defensive power survivability and a centipede gives you poison and fear skills for like crowd control to make things run away and stuff like that
3406908	3414953	Class Designer Bjorn Mikkelsen said in a livestream that happened this last week that Spiritborn is the fastest and most aggressive class.
3415434	3420037	So you just do a lot of burst damage with pole arms, quarterstaffs, and all this good stuff.
3420437	3423639	So, yeah, it sounds like it's a pretty interesting class.
3424339	3429042	We also know that Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion will be launching on October 8th.
3429422	3433825	The regular edition will be $40, but if you want to spend more money on it...
3435106	3435946	You certainly can.
3436886	3437907	They're happy to take your money.
3437967	3440667	I think there's like a $100 edition out there and much more.
3441107	3443288	So check that out if that's of interest to you.
3444868	3447988	Anyway, but yeah, the Spiritborn coming to Diablo 4 in October.
3448068	3451029	October's really not that far away if you think about it, right?
3451069	3452049	Because we're at the end of July.
3452069	3453229	It's already spooky season.
3453249	3454010	What are you talking about?
3454030	3454570	That's right.
3454710	3456970	Once the 4th of July is over, spooky season begins.
3457170	3457570	That's it.
3457690	3457870	Yep.
3458210	3459571	Where's my pumpkin spice latte?
3459711	3460211	Any day now.
3462831	3476543	Pumpkin Spice is so passe I bet Duncan rolls out Pumpkin Spice in about two weeks They are almost always like early August now with the Pumpkin Spice Boring Starbies will be the week before DragonCon
3477364	3505862	that's usually when Starbees rolls it out because usually I enjoy for the last like five years I have enjoyed my first pumpkin spice latte at Dragon Con at the Starbees at Dragon Con there used to be a Starbees at America Mart right there but they closed that one after or at least in the last year it disappeared it wasn't there last year or so but I think I think one of the hotels has a Starbees because I still remember getting my pumpkin spice latte for the first time at Dragon Con last year so you know what I want hmm
3506642	3530595	I want a pumpkin latte not spice because it's not pumpkin it's just the spices in it I want pumpkin cream like they had at Disneyland I could dip my churros in actual legit pumpkin cream and it tasted like pumpkin and not pumpkin spice
3531454	3533175	All this sugar I'm not supposed to have.
3534235	3535616	Pumpkin's actually really good for you.
3535936	3536396	I know, I know.
3536757	3538597	If you just eat pumpkin as it is.
3539338	3540538	I love roasted pumpkin.
3540678	3541679	But anyway, that's a different story.
3541819	3542479	That's a different story.
3542519	3546361	Speaking of a different story, DarkSakura, EVO was happening this weekend.
3546381	3548542	Yeah, I forgot about EVO.
3548762	3550923	We got a little fighting game news, though.
3550943	3551944	I think this is exciting.
3552104	3553084	I was thinking you might, too.
3553104	3553605	We did.
3554025	3554805	A couple of things.
3554925	3559367	But the big one is SNK versus Capcom SVC Chaos.
3559627	3559908	Yes.
3561008	3564849	is being re-released for PS4, for Switch, and Steam.
3565690	3568931	And it looks like you can get it right now.
3569971	3580735	It's a fun fighting game, although it doesn't have the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 delight that is Let Me Take You for a Ride.
3581015	3582495	Just saying.
3582895	3587597	And, well, also they announced Fatal Fury City of the Wolves.
3587897	3588017	Hmm.
3589085	3606020	so that's cool I wonder where they're going with the story in that um but of course we know the original SNK versus Capcom came out on Neo Geo Pocket Color yep so I think it's going to be great you know they're
3607481	3620455	We're also seeing that Mai and Terry Bogard are being released in Street Fighter 6 for Season 2 with Bison and Elena.
3621296	3622437	Where's my Sakura, dammit?
3623385	3642630	I want her to be in her gym teacher outfit from the end of Street Fighter Alpha 2 and yeah I think it's Vice Immature also DLC characters for King of Fighters 15 and I see something on here but I'm not sure what this came from but
3643090	3671942	Athena from the game Athena not from Psycho Soldier so not like King of Fighters original Athena but the original original Athena that was in the game of the same name old school NES game maybe that's being added for SNK vs. Capcom possibly but anyway I think it's going to be fun I might have to look into it now that I have means of playing it
3672740	3701617	I am in lockstep with Dark Tatsuya's comment over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network who says I wasn't as big on Chaos as I am CVS2 but for 20 bucks I'll consider revisiting it I'm there like this isn't if this was Capcom vs SNK 2 I would be gay screaming flailing crying throwing up all of it I'd be going through all those emotions right now you know what I want them to do but SVC Chaos is okay okay I'm here for that you know what I want them to do hmm
3702830	3706471	I want them to just release a game called Ultimate Versus.
3706491	3707971	And it has everyone.
3707991	3711192	You just want Mugen?
3711252	3714792	No, I would rather have something that's actually polished and balanced.
3718313	3727155	Because then I can get my Tatsunoko characters where I can play them on something that I don't have to look to dig out of a box and hook up.
3727595	3727835	Yeah.
3730093	3758415	Bonds006 and DJ Ranma S in chat both echo we all would be in regards to my reaction to CBS 2 News you know what fam I appreciate you all I feel like I feel like I have a new idea for an Orange Knowledge Radio shirt are you ready are you ready screaming flailing crying throwing up together Orange Knowledge Radio we'll see that's my shirt idea
3761547	3762007	We'll see.
3763088	3763408	Alright.
3764930	3767752	I have ideas for other shirts.
3769136	3776201	Some people would probably take issue with throwing up on there because, you know, some people have a very big aversion to that, but I hope people understand.
3776281	3791573	It's supposed to be an over-the-top reaction because, I mean, look, if you want to see the literal interpretation of screaming, flailing, crying, throwing up together, go look at
3792353	3796176	whenever they do a Nintendo Direct at the Nintendo World Store.
3796736	3805822	Like, go look at when they announced, I want to say it was the original release, or the original announcement of Ultimate Smash Bros.
3806163	3814789	When they originally announced that, the Everybody Is Here trailer, go look at the reaction trailer at the Nintendo World Store when that was shown.
3815849	3816730	Yeah, exactly.
3817031	3819293	DJ Ranma S says that one kid who passed out.
3819393	3819994	Exactly.
3820474	3823777	That is screaming, flailing, crying, throwing up.
3823938	3827982	That is the physical manifestation of that.
3829313	3831615	I still have another idea for sure, by the way.
3831855	3832575	Oh, what's that?
3832695	3836337	It's Money Can't Buy You Love, but it can buy DBD DLC.
3837998	3839199	Or DBD Cosmetics.
3839419	3840360	That's a pretty good one.
3840700	3841981	It can buy in-game cosmetics.
3843862	3845783	If you say in-game cosmetics, it's a little more universal.
3846123	3846444	That's it.
3847364	3849625	I can't dress myself, but I can dress my characters.
3852548	3855672	Moving on, let's talk about this.
3856112	3859596	Kind of a reminder, really, from us to you here at OLR.
3859756	3864482	The Xbox 360 digital store is closing on July 29th.
3865603	3867465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3883200	3884401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3905902	3932484	on the Xbox 360 and you know that that one is backwards compatible and all that good stuff so you can see but I'm also like if you don't own Skyrim at this point one way or another like shocked emoji Pikachu shocked emoji if you do not have Skyrim somehow some way at this point but if you have to remedy that you can get that for $4.49 there's other games that are like a buck right now so there's a huge sale going on on Microsoft it might be worth checking out if nothing else
3933044	3935065	Something you can get for free.
3935585	3946511	There is a brand new dynamic background for your Xbox Series X or Xbox One that has the original Blades user interface from the Xbox 360 era.
3946852	3947992	But don't get it twisted.
3948132	3953075	It's not going to actually turn your Xbox into looking, acting like the Xbox 360.
3954156	3958558	It's just going to show the Blades on the side and have that same kind of look to it.
3958878	3959479	But the feel...
3960319	3961120	Ain't gonna be it.
3961260	3967305	But it's one last little hurrah if you like to remember your Xbox 360 that way.
3967725	3971048	Because remember, the blades didn't even last the entire life of the 360.
3971088	3973891	They changed that somewhere along the way.
3973931	3977033	So it is kind of nice that they're kind of remembering that there.
3977934	3981657	DJ Ranma S is pointing out, I just picked up Oni Chambara for $2.99.
3981817	3981957	Wow.
3981977	3982378	That's a deal.
3982398	3982698	All right.
3989522	3996047	Well, a lot of you are going to be picking up classic games this week on the Xbox 360 big everything must go sale digitally.
3997008	4002492	But let's take a trip down memory lane in this next segment we like to do every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4003152	4003713	Let's roll the bumper.
4014338	4021623	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4022104	4024645	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4025886	4032951	And DarkSakura, you've got to explain this game of the week because as I understand it, basketball is dead?
4034392	4037795	Dead, dead, dead, dead and banned.
4039525	4042186	The game is called... Are you ready?
4042446	4042646	Yes.
4042707	4045468	Everybody, can you even handle what this game is called?
4046748	4047109	I'm ready.
4047769	4049350	Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.
4052771	4060435	It is a freeware roleplay game that was developed by Tales of Games Studio and presented as a joke.
4061266	4062067	Shayla, hi!
4062307	4078096	Anyway, jokingly, as an official sequel to both Barclay's Shut Up and Jam and Space Jam, and it uses JRPG-style battles, and you go through dungeons and everything, and yay!
4078476	4082479	Anyway, let's start at the story.
4083686	4089808	So the story is that it's in 2041 with a post-cyberpocalyptic Neo-New York.
4090108	4090768	That's quotes.
4092248	4099310	Charles Barkley performs a powerful chaos dunk at a basketball game and kills most of everybody in attendance.
4099810	4105892	And so basketball becomes outlawed and many basketball players are hunted down and killed.
4107634	4116476	and then in 2053 another chaos dunk happens in Manhattan and millions die and they all blame Charles Barkley.
4118036	4121897	So he's being hunted by the B-Ball removal unit led by Michael Jordan.
4124137	4135080	He is rescued by another outlaw called the Ultimate Hellbane and they go to the tomb of LeBron James and it gets weirder from there.
4138263	4141144	Yeah, yeah, weird, weird, weird, weird.
4142084	4152027	Anyway, it uses a battle system called the Baby System, B-A-B-B-Y, that is influenced by a bunch of JRPGs.
4152107	4154208	How is Babi formed?
4154508	4155568	How is Babi formed?
4157605	4159205	Clawstorm says, what in tarnation?
4159486	4161166	And I'm like, yeah.
4161666	4166547	So enemies will appear on a field and may run at you and attack if you move into their line of sight.
4166587	4168647	Kind of, I guess, Chrono Trigger-like, to be honest.
4170288	4175409	But once the battle is initiated, you have a number of attacks and skills you can use.
4175989	4182350	And they're done kind of like a Mario RPG where they're timed or multiple button presses and accuracy gets you more hits.
4185151	4185631	But yeah.
4185651	4185731	Yeah.
4186909	4188150	This game is fucking weird.
4189531	4192533	Like, I knew it existed, but I...
4195563	4199486	This is the first time I decided to dust it off and bring it out.
4199546	4203388	And it is a freeware game, so like, yeah.
4204269	4208752	So, at any rate, it was developed by Tales of Games Studios.
4210873	4217498	It was different members from an amateur game development forum.
4218478	4225363	And they were inspired after there was an awkward phrase on Michael Jordan's Wikipedia page about
4225863	4227844	whether or not Space Jam is canon.
4229364	4229584	Yeah.
4229984	4233145	Yes, it's canon.
4233165	4237266	They were considering like a Looney Tunes series or for Michael Jordan's life.
4238747	4243808	And there were certain members that said, you know, let's just make a game about it.
4243848	4245609	And they developed it in RPG Maker 2003.
4245709	4252371	Their names are great because it's Chef Boyardee, Bort, Jeezy, and QuackGyver.
4254731	4282073	but after they developed it in RPG Maker they ported it to Game Maker 6.1 and they were going to release it in both formats but they did it in Game Maker 6.1 because it had more power and flexibility and at the 2014 Awesome Games Done Quick the developers had stated they never played the original Shut Up and Jam and just brainstormed ideas for an RPG that made them laugh
4284767	4292012	There was a sequel that they had announced in November 2012 that was since cancelled.
4292593	4302140	It's called The Magical Realms of Ternanog, Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of Kukolin, The Official Game of the Movie, Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley Saga.
4302981	4303461	That's the name.
4305463	4307844	And it had a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter.
4309165	4309866	They were...
4311946	4337960	they raised $120,335 by December 28th that year and it was gonna keep the self-aware tone they were doing all the artwork from scratch and then a bunch of people left the project and then the game was cancelled in June 2021 and they just released the source code to the public and that's it
4339409	4343911	That is Barkley's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, the RPG.
4344051	4353635	It is available for Windows and Mac OS X. I don't know if it's going to run on any of the modern versions, given that it's probably 32-bit.
4354956	4355376	All right.
4355936	4356276	Love it.
4357597	4359037	Great pick tonight, DarkSakura.
4359057	4359658	Thank you for that.
4360058	4363079	Love a very random indie sort of title.
4364059	4364460	It's great.
4364860	4365400	Great, great, great.
4366735	4367155	V-O-G Network.com
4384815	4385716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4408294	4410175	Bob Newhart, Richard Simmons, Dr. Ruth, Shannon Doherty, Cancer, Bitch
4430325	4456723	Shelly Duvall, absolutely, Diabetes Which, yeah, which hits a little too close to home But Shelly Duvall also, Fairytale Theater That's who I'm always going to remember Shelly Duvall from Yeah, Fairytale Theater I just keep thinking of, and Popeye has come up in like various different things over and over I need to watch that movie again now that I'm an adult The last time, I actually saw that movie on the big screen years and years ago Years ago
4457703	4483908	um so yeah because the the theater the 99 cent theater because that's what it was back then uh would show random kids movies today no we are uh sunrise there was a small ass little place in Roseville and I it may even predate when you moved to California but it was called Harding Cinema do you remember this oh it turned no I wasn't there when I was when I came out it ultimately turned into a radio shack which I know the radio shack now
4485754	4510454	is something else because Radio Shack's gone so it's something else now I don't remember but it's over off it's it's not it's on Harding near the Galleria very local chat but you know shout out to my Northern California uh besties who might know what I'm talking about but yeah that used to be a movie theater back in the day dang yeah anyway uh let's get to some uh quick news here I think we just have a couple stories DarkSakura you have something for us
4511607	4511807	I do.
4513408	4523476	So we all know the term roguelike, but has anyone in here who is not older than 35 played Rogue?
4524096	4524817	You can play it now!
4525817	4530581	It's been released on Switch, and it's $7.99.
4530681	4533803	Go download it and be just as frustrated as the rest of us.
4535084	4535564	Perfect.
4536885	4537325	And then...
4539622	4540683	Was there another one on here?
4540923	4541403	I got one.
4541423	4541624	No.
4541824	4542484	I got one for you.
4543445	4555755	The other one, I would say, though, the Rogue, it is not the Commodore 64 version of Rogue, which is what I expected, but it's the Amiga version of Rogue, so it actually looks, it's a little more graphical than just, like, ASCII art, which the original, original Rogue was.
4555995	4558637	So it actually will look decent on your Switch, for what it's worth.
4560659	4567944	and I only say that because I've played the Commodore 64 edition of Rogue and it's a little rough if you're used to fancy graphics.
4569204	4570405	That part hasn't aged well.
4571326	4575388	But anyway, let's talk about a game that has aged well because it still has its fans.
4575488	4580151	Taiko no Tatooine or Taiko Drum Master as it's sometimes known over here in the States.
4580552	4586976	Finally, this surprises me that we've never had an official US arcade launch of Taiko no Tatooine.
4587396	4587997	We've had...
4588717	4615069	console launches you know console game finally but finally finally Namco Bandai is going to be releasing Taiko no Tatsujin initially at round one then at Dave and Buster's it's actually happening they did a test run and it actually is happening there was an official world championship that happened to Japan this last week and they made some announcements and they mentioned that
4615629	4643099	they will release Taiko no Tatsujin into the US this November so check that out if you have a round one or a Dave and Buster's near you good chance you're going to see one of these machines so that's going to be a lot of fun it's a fun machine to play like I don't think it translates quite as well to home because there's something about banging on that giant fucking drum that's very satisfying that was another game I played at that same arcade that had a
4644921	4646202	and Radiant Silvergun.
4646363	4646743	Oh, really?
4647704	4647844	Yeah.
4647864	4652568	Well, they also had Gun Survivor 2, Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.
4652708	4653649	Oh, interesting.
4654130	4654490	How about that?
4655788	4660792	All right, well, now we are going to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

4939044	4941465	Another game that I'm actually interested in called Indica.
4942603	4949483	and it's like about this Russian nun that goes on a quest with the devil at her side.
4951360	4953002	I'm really interested in that.
4953882	4957786	We have Bitmap Bureau Collection for Switch and PlayStation.
4957846	4962010	By the way, Indica is on PS5, so I doubt I'll be playing anytime soon.
4962691	4965733	For Switch, we have B Project USA Fantasia 1.
4967375	4972219	And then also for PlayStation, we have My Time at Sandrock Collector's Edition.
4973701	4975623	That one also looks interesting to me.
4977124	4977204	Hmm.
4978550	5001276	so but I don't know Indica just seems like it would be like my kind of weird game yeah you know thick story driven will Sativa be out soon huh will Sativa be out soon Rob come over to my house so I can smack you I make the puns when Loki's not here or Drew
5002506	5005808	Damn it, Drew, be on the show again so we can just smack you instead.

5009289	5010490	Come on the show so I can hit you.
5011651	5015833	No, it's virtual.
5016553	5018714	Besides that.
5019154	5022856	It's the good old MIRC days of slapping around with a large trout.
5024197	5025778	I know where Drew works anyway.
5028367	5055696	two rows away from my desk no no no but it just seems like it would be I actually really enjoy the cover art and it reminds me of like the Russian constructivism art style when that came about so art nerd art nerd anyway but yeah you can just leave out the word art Rob what Rob what

5061047	5062087	We're gonna go to brunch.

5067591	5068912	Are you gonna throw a sausage at me?
5068932	5071113	Because I feel like you're gonna throw a breakfast sausage at me.

5095372	5095612	What?
5095912	5097292	Drag Race Talk!
5098753	5100113	Because we have no email either.
5101013	5105255	I haven't... There's like 15 versions of Drag Race now.
5105435	5107756	I can't possibly stay on top of them all.
5108436	5114938	I started trying to watch Canada vs. the World.
5115058	5115338	Uh-huh.
5116746	5128428	and I couldn't because I mean not no shade against Brooklyn Heights but I need Mama Rue there you know you know drag I just want to see Brooklyn Heights do ballet and look pretty
5129517	5136624	The other con was, okay, so I was telling a joke somewhere.
5136704	5141710	I can't talk about it, but I was telling a joke somewhere and I was doing an impression of Jinx Monsoon.
5142170	5147116	And my impression of Jinx Monsoon is to do Jinx Monsoon as Judy Garland, to do that impression.
5147516	5148237	Sandwich.
5148697	5149438	Sandwich.
5150759	5169945	is that my camera over there and I actually made a joke about I'm not even sure why I am planning on going to DragonCon I thought this was supposed to be DragCon you know DragonCon and DragCon are very similar names but DragCon actually happened this weekend yeah yeah which I don't go to anymore
5171027	5194071	although now if you freaking do uh if you have to do Judy Garland jinx then I have to come out with a scarf tied around my head and a magnifying glass and go well mother dear said that we should never talk to strangers I need to watch Grey Gardens again I'm just saying clearly we have devolved into the part of the show that is we're getting shit up here
5194727	5197128	Where we'll talk about anything you want to bring up in chat.
5197748	5199608	Or if you want to give us a call, now's a great time to do so.
5199688	5201269	This is now just chatting.
5201969	5203129	This is now a just chatting stream.
5203829	5208951	We would usually go to the mailbag over at participate at orangelondrader.com.
5209291	5213772	However, that would require the listeners of our wonderful podcast to actually put mail in there.
5214272	5221114	So if you're listening, look, if you have never... It is emptier and drier than Margaret Thatcher's cooch.
5221374	5221414	If...
5223857	5224217	Why?
5225579	5229703	I have a lot of questions on why you just said that, but I'm going to save that for another time.
5230164	5233708	Shayla, twat?
5234108	5234368	What?
5236850	5238371	No, Shayla, it was funnier with the first thing.
5238391	5238692	All right.
5239192	5240513	It was funnier with the twat.
5240553	5242455	So twat, did you say?
5242875	5243356	All right.
5243396	5243616	Anyway.
5243756	5245517	I couldn't hear you.
5246518	5247199	What was I going to say?
5247379	5252984	Oh, if you are a podcast listener and you have not emailed us, I want to hear from you.
5253144	5254705	I'd love to know that you exist.
5254825	5255046	Please.
5255346	5257568	Could you just send me an email that says I exist?
5258128	5258488	Please.
5258749	5259790	I just I would love that.
5259930	5260310	I promise.

5261131	5262332	Honk if you exist.
5262492	5262792	Yeah.
5263152	5264233	Honk if you exist.
5264313	5264794	I love that.
5265334	5270063	You know, I actually have that as a magnet from Omega Mart.
5270884	5271365	Oh my god.
5271445	5273028	Alright, we're going to the phones.
5273769	5274511	Rob, what is butter?
5275452	5275933	Think about it.
5276114	5276334	Fat?
5278755	5290237	Okay, I still have to say my favorite thing from Omega Mart for products, apart from gender fluid, because that was great too, was the natural intentions cleaning spray.
5290677	5290977	All right.
5291878	5293418	We have a call on the line.
5293458	5294078	Let's get to it.
5294138	5295198	Hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio.
5295218	5295598	Who's this?
5296618	5299379	I just want you to know I turned off my air conditioning for this.
5299539	5300739	So, hell hey, everyone.
5300779	5301319	It's Ranma.
5301339	5301859	Hey, Ranma.
5301879	5302640	It's good to see you.
5302720	5303080	How are you?
5303100	5304160	It is muggy as fuck up there.
5305458	5327869	well it's not that it's just that the way my studio is set up the air conditioner is right behind the monitor where the window is so I have to turn the AC off which is great but like an hour into my live stream I'm just like no I'm sweating worse than a sinner at the club on a Saturday night you know what is on your mind my friend
5328578	5330039	Well, a couple of things.
5330539	5334001	Number one, I went to a convention yesterday called Collecticon.
5334401	5341526	It's called the country's biggest anime, gaming, trading card convention out there.
5341806	5353593	Okay, please, please, please reassure me because when I hear Collecticon, my image that comes to my mind is that there are so many Funko Pops being shit out of that dealer room.
5353793	5355394	There are so many Funko Pops.
5357192	5359455	My fabulous brother in Christ, you ain't wrong.
5361537	5363159	Look at my bookshelf, okay?
5363779	5367023	I can't, DarkSakura, you don't have a fucking camera.
5367684	5367924	Bitch.
5368304	5368525	Okay.
5369005	5369726	Alright, anyway.
5370876	5378719	Rob, let me tell you, most of these comic conventions, they need to call them Funko PopCon because a third of the dealers are selling pops anywhere from $10 to $300.
5379159	5383560	And the only reason why they're expensive is because they aren't autographed.
5383861	5384621	And you know what?
5384881	5385841	You can keep them.
5386041	5390063	I need to address something that Clawstorm is saying in chat, saying DragonCon has entered the chat.
5390163	5392964	The biggest you say, okay, you ain't wrong, however...
5393584	5423002	DragonCon's vendor room is so fucking big it's four stories fucking big that sure I can get Funko Pops but I can also get like a kilt a sword an unopened pack of Tron trading cards from the 1980s which I actually fucking bought one year you can get a lot of shit at the DragonCon dealer hall I don't doubt it see that just reminds me you can buy a dragon yes you can
5427741	5449384	I'm almost positive somewhere in that dealer hall is a dragon con that you can blow smoke out of like a dragon would breathe fire I'm positive that is a thing I've seen in the dealer hall you know, a tobacco pipe anyway I had to play on Shayla says buy a dragon and name him Jeremy
5451536	5477570	I'm sorry Ranma, we were talking about you had a topic here and we derailed it tonight because DarkSakura and I are misbehaving tonight when aren't y'all derailing and misbehaving, I mean really we kind of like it, it's like mods away, post away we live, we live it's shit posting time exactly anyway what do you want
5478891	5484616	Well, if you want to be like that about it, I'm just fucking with you.
5485797	5486558	I love you, Rob.
5490001	5490401	All right.
5491302	5504334	So I went to this convention and I was on the line for about an hour to get a particular autograph from somebody that we've discussed on this podcast more than one time.
5505462	5507663	and I'm kicking it out of the box.
5507683	5510344	I could just give you an autograph for free, Ranchan.
5510664	5511304	Is that Martinet?
5511985	5515286	Yes, Charles Martinet autographed my Luigi figure.
5515526	5517127	Oh, how's Grandpa doing?
5517387	5518667	We haven't talked about him in a while.
5518707	5525050	How's his Mario ambassadorship and apparently Luigi ambassadorship, how's that treating him?
5526090	5526811	It's going well.
5527251	5528371	Let me tell you something.
5528411	5529992	He has special stuff autographed.
5530312	5534274	He is selling autographed Famicom, Super Famicom, N64,
5535820	5539241	and cards up to $400.
5540162	5540522	Gimme.
5540722	5542562	Make that fucking coin, Uncle Charles.
5542722	5543363	Make that coin.
5543383	5547624	I took a picture of the layout and I will post it later so you can check it out.
5547984	5550545	And I did my Luigi voice for him and he loved it.
5551405	5552166	Aww, I love that.
5553766	5555927	Wait, did you go dressed as Black Luigi?
5557083	5561486	Unfortunately, I could not because I was there with one of my partners.
5561966	5573954	We actually did Mamoru and Usagi from Sailor Moon because Terry Hawks, one of the original English dubs of Usagi, Serena, was there, so we went to get a picture with them.
5574514	5578457	Wasn't she also the one who was on Beverly Hills Teens as Bianca?
5579909	5581430	Probably.
5581670	5587474	Actually, Garth the Wolf in chat has a very valid request asking, Ranma, could you do your Luigi voice now?
5589095	5591456	I'm a Luigi, number one superstar.
5592537	5592937	I love it.
5593277	5593537	Love it.
5594258	5594598	A plus.
5598760	5600001	You win five QR codes.
5600061	5602182	I'm so glad you got to meet Charles Martinet.
5602202	5602923	He's such a nice guy.
5603638	5604959	And he was really chill.
5604979	5606919	Like I said, the line was long.
5607179	5611701	But I love seeing the fact there were people getting non-Mario stuff by him signing.
5611721	5615643	I'm talking about Luigi, Wario, Waluigi stuff.
5616023	5616643	It felt good.
5617263	5617463	Yeah.
5617763	5619284	No, I'm glad.
5619524	5624146	His name hasn't come up in a while ever since we know that Mario Brothers Wonder had a new voice actor and all that stuff.
5624166	5627247	And I'm really glad that the convention circuit life is treating him well.
5627327	5627747	Good for him.
5629168	5629768	Telling me.
5631564	5654234	but there is something else I want to discuss real quick between getting this autograph and the conversations of like a lot of retro games and so forth I kind of want to say that I'm done with video games that are first person third person to an extent I'm kind of tired of it what do you mean I mean
5655939	5657320	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5680327	5681408	Not just, like, 2D games.
5681468	5684931	I'm like, I want more 2D action-adventure games.
5684951	5692417	Like, they just announced a Karate Kid arcade-style beat-em-up, like, in the vein of Turtle Shredder's Revenge.
5692637	5696160	That is a day-one purchase for me, digital and physical.
5696600	5701264	I want to see more of that, because... I don't know, I'm just...
5703752	5706113	All right, old man sitting on the porch in the rocking chair.
5706193	5709495	Pass me a butterscotch disc because... Stop screaming at the clouds.
5709515	5710816	Here we go.
5711777	5713598	No, I was laughing.
5715139	5719382	When you said, I don't like first person or third person, I was with Clawstorm in chat.
5719422	5720202	What does that leave?
5721003	5721903	Second person?
5721964	5723084	Second person.
5723244	5728388	That's a very difficult... I think second person is with Deadpool, but that's a different type of thing.
5728428	5728688	Yeah.
5729710	5749487	but I mean, I do enjoy some first person shooters, action adventure games and third person ones, but I'm just like I don't know, maybe I just feel the longing of yesteryear when I was a teenager you sat down, you put in Super Mario World and you just played the heck out of that game or Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past and you went through it, you know
5750288	5755211	We have, maybe it's just, I just feel all the tech we have in these consoles, the power.
5755491	5759974	Maybe I want to see like the perfect arcade portable classic game or something like that.
5760354	5768279	Or a new arcade game, a new game that's in the arcade style that makes it feel like back when I was 12 years old, shucking quarters into Gauntlet, you know?
5769200	5772342	So I would like to translate what you're saying for our listeners.
5772382	5772762	You ready?
5772782	5774163	Go for it.
5775236	5776177	Thanks for watching!
5795816	5805758	Whatever happened to the video games I just put in a quarter and I played for five minutes and that fucking thing would rob me blind and then I'd just go eat some cheap-ass cardboard pizza and call it a day.
5806518	5809519	But Rob... You tell them, Grandpa Rob.
5809699	5810479	You tell them.
5810719	5813940	I'm gonna get my cane and show my solidarity.
5813980	5815781	I'm gonna shove this cane up your ass.
5816481	5821782	Back in my day, we only had monochrome and there were two bits and we liked it.
5824281	5825961	You know I'm just fucking with you because I love you.
5826321	5827942	No, I know.
5829482	5830822	You are sound in the game.
5836603	5839364	If that console doesn't have a black and white switch, I don't want it.
5843424	5849346	I mean, look, I enjoy modern first person games, but it's like all these buttons.
5849466	5851366	I just want to pick up a game.
5852284	5853886	Punch, kick, jump, that's it.
5854246	5857569	Let's just roll, and I'll just sit there for hours upon hours.
5857649	5858590	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5859210	5864315	TigerClaw in chat says, that's how Gen Z looks at us boomers.
5864355	5865336	Are you a boomer?
5866077	5866737	Boomers?
5867978	5869420	Are you a boomer, TigerClaw?
5869740	5872442	Because I'm a fucking Xeniel.
5872483	5873243	Hello, bitch.
5873684	5873864	Wait.
5874369	5876930	Claw is older than us, but hold up.
5877530	5877890	Hold up.
5878090	5878450	Hold up.
5878630	5881611	Do not make me come down there with my cane and beat you.
5882171	5882691	I will do it.
5883532	5883892	I will.
5884252	5887413	You just channeled my inner Gen X rage, boy.
5888273	5897276	Dude, if you're a boomer, then... I don't know if the first video game you played might have been on the spectroscope or something.
5897516	5898676	Do you remember Mimeographs?
5899416	5901477	Actually, don't answer that because I remember Mimeographs.
5902217	5902437	Same.
5904932	5905832	The smell of ink.
5906392	5909373	The delicious smell of ink.
5909473	5912855	I don't know what the fuck happened to this call, but I say that about this show a lot.
5913635	5916096	Ranma, anything else on your mind tonight you want to share with us?
5916776	5921177	Yeah, one thing for Jamie, in case she hasn't heard.
5921897	5922137	What?
5923318	5924298	Brand new Ranma 1.5.
5925338	5925599	What?
5926299	5926599	Yes!
5928199	5928719	Bitch, where?
5929780	5930640	October 5th.
5932541	5933301	Original voices?
5934076	5940299	Yes, except for Ukyo, Nabiki, Tsukimi, and Happosai.
5940339	5941900	They are dead.
5942020	5945921	It's going to be sad not having my Ukyo.
5946922	5948743	Studio Mappa is doing it.
5951244	5953045	It's going to be on Nippon Television.
5953365	5957347	And unfortunately, distribution rights are going to Netflix.
5958174	5958735	You know what?
5958975	5959415	Fuck that.
5959455	5960436	The internet exists.
5960516	5962078	Get me some fan subs, bitch!
5962699	5974330	Well, this is premiering the first episode of Anime NYC and I do believe there's going to be a certain Black Ranma that's going to try to be at the front of that line with the trivia, so you know how that goes.
5974731	5976532	I will send you a spatula from here.
5977449	5978230	I know you will.
5978470	5979711	I'm happy because you're happy.
5979871	5981633	I mean, I may not be the anime connoisseur.
5981653	5983754	I do actually have a collection of Okonomiyaki Spatulae.
5984475	5989919	I may not be the anime connoisseur that you are, but I know your name is Ranma and you love that show and I'm happy you're happy.
5990800	5993883	That's why I'm wearing this specific, what?
5994423	5995604	Specific t-shirt tonight.
5995664	6000748	For those of you who are listening, I have an anime shirt decked out in the style of Marvel vs. Capcom.
6000928	6001329	Perfect.
6002690	6002830	Great.
6003404	6013535	I want to know how many people, though, of our general age, were introduced to Urasayatsura by watching Matthew Sweet's video for I've Been Waiting.
6014756	6019081	I haven't, but I actually know someone who actually worked on the first movie.
6020502	6020943	That's cool.
6021690	6027355	Yeah, and we were in Discord on our old school chat just watching the new series and talking about it and stuff.
6027555	6027976	Good times.
6028836	6046772	I was a big fan of Matthew Sweet in like the early 90s and he put out two videos that used anime footage and one of them was Urosayatsura for I've Been Waiting and the other one was from Cobra, which kind of a racy anime, but it was for Girlfriend.
6047673	6048614	Space Adventure Cobra?
6049150	6049690	Yeah.
6050170	6051851	I remember Spaceship Adventure.
6052891	6057112	I watched it when I shouldn't have been watching it, but it was cartoon.
6057172	6057712	It's fun.
6057732	6059773	You're not wrong.
6061353	6067334	Meanwhile, I'm sitting here watching the Zenki OAV.
6069315	6072316	Imagine going from the series of Zenki and then to the OAV version.
6072356	6073016	Shit got weird.
6073756	6073976	Anyway.
6075137	6075417	Alright.
6076097	6079319	Well, Ranma, I appreciate the phone call, but I'm gonna let you go.
6080560	6087663	Have a wonderful week, and of course, all this and much more on Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights, also part of the Voice Geeks Network.
6088223	6091905	And I look forward to hearing about how Anime NYC goes for you with all that.
6092205	6092805	Definitely.
6093146	6099229	And I will say, because of the storm that happened over the weekend, I do not have to go in at 6am.
6099269	6102090	I don't have to be in until about 8.30 to kind of fan the flames.
6103804	6105285	Probably because you work too late on Friday.
6105745	6106406	Good luck to you.
6107747	6108287	I pray for you.
6108768	6111830	The funny part was mostly the LA office had to deal with the brunt end.
6112131	6119697	I am putting a sign at my desk that says if your machine is blue screening, just send an email to the service desk and we'll get to you as soon as we can.
6119897	6120838	Turn it on and off again.
6120898	6121398	No, I'm just kidding.
6122079	6125662	If your computer has a blue screen, switch to Mac.
6129285	6131507	That's another hot topic debate at work, but
6131986	6132886	Rob, really?
6133247	6133807	I'm joking.
6134347	6135748	Turning it off and turning it back on?
6136448	6137728	Works nine times out of ten.
6137968	6141730	I have a pin on the way that says, did you turn it off and back on?
6143091	6143431	Alright.
6143851	6145752	Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap it up.
6145772	6146672	Thanks so much for calling in.
6146692	6147192	Appreciate you.
6148113	6148493	Love y'all.
6149449	6149889	Bye-bye.
6150409	6150790	Bye.
6151850	6154071	Alright, always a pleasure to hear from our pal Ranma.
6154971	6157292	With that though, we are towards the end of the show.
6157352	6159693	We would usually do last minute stories, but I don't have any.
6159753	6162614	We were kind of scraping the stories we could get anyway.
6163274	6165335	So we're at that part where we get everybody's final thought.
6165355	6168116	We were like, please sir, may I have another?
6168996	6170577	I'm ever so hungry for email.
6170597	6171817	Or stories.
6172618	6175839	DarkSakura, are you streaming tonight or are you taking a break because of yesterday?
6175859	6176119	I'm
6177219	6191764	I'm gonna do it cause I wanna play with Shay cause Shay's here and Shay is like Shay is like the ghost in my life sometimes she's awake and then she's there to play with and sometimes I'm like where is a Shay?
6192484	6205108	Shay is asleep alright well let me go ahead and get your final thought now since I have no Loki to banter with here I have to give you the I have to fill the time here before we toss it over to you so I'll go ahead and let you have your final thought
6206004	6210959	buy all our playsets and toys alright thanks DarkSakura, have a good night
6213242	6213823	All right.
6214383	6218646	Well, with that, I can't believe it, but it's just me left.
6218987	6222149	And that's kind of a scary notion here.
6222709	6228294	But if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, thank you as always for listening to the show.
6228854	6229655	Help us spread the word.
6229735	6235139	Tell a friend about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6235239	6239162	So a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube,
6239562	6242003	Spotify, wherever it is that you found this podcast.
6242043	6244323	It goes an awful long way and we really appreciate it.
6244783	6248364	We will be back again next week to talk about the things that happen in gaming this week.
6248404	6251225	Could be very interesting what develops with the FTC and all that good stuff.
6251705	6256367	Loki will be back next week so we can hear all about how things have been for him since it will have been a few weeks at that point.
6256947	6260828	And yeah, with that, I want to thank all of you that came out to our chat room tonight.
6260868	6261528	I appreciate you.
6261588	6262888	Thank you so much for being here live.
6263509	6264029	Appreciate that.
6264569	6267130	And that just leaves me with my final thought tonight, which is...
6270311	6271832	I'm excited to be streaming again.
6271893	6274515	It's been like two weeks since I've done a stream because I've been sick.
6274935	6276316	Being sick sucks.
6276876	6277677	Don't get sick.
6277877	6278938	I advised against it.
6279038	6280119	It's a horrible time.
6281960	6282821	Thank you so much everybody.
6283161	6283902	Have a great night.
6283942	6284602	We'll see you next time.
