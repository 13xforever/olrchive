1
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:05,772
and more.

2
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching.

3
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

4
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:46,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:58,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 1010 or 1010 of our show for tonight, July the 7th of 2024.

6
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:00,413
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back after an unexpected week off.

7
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:01,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll address that in just a moment.

8
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,375
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, I want to introduce my co-host.

9
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:04,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I am Rob Roberts.

10
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:05,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here with you every week.

11
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:07,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me are my co-hosts.

12
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,601
[SPEAKER_05]: or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:12,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, hello.

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you are doing well.

15
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:15,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've had an exhausting weekend.

16
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:15,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

17
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:18,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, how has it ever been?

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,204
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, on top of that, like, my AC is on, it's going out.

19
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:30,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll stay, it'll get the house nice and cool when it's also nice and cool outside.

20
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:36,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, and then it's like, ah, I know, I'm not doing it.

21
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:39,375
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets out a big FFS, and then...

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very, very hot in Sacramento, California, where we are based.

23
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:55,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, really, I think a lot of the country, a lot of the West Coast, so like for me to say just us is really underestimating what's happening, you know, around the U.S.

24
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:56,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 113 yesterday.

25
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was 113 yesterday, 108 today.

26
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So hence, for me, you'll notice my arcade machines are off.

27
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually if my machines are off, that's a sign that something...

28
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:10,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Bucky's going on with the weather because I pretty much keep those off when it's really hot days.

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though they don't generate a lot of heat, I don't need anything extra right now.

30
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:15,822
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

31
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:24,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently we're going to have a few days under 100 next week, so yay.

32
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay, I lied.

33
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:28,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple of days.

34
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

35
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:32,908
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it will be cooler on the day of my recital.

36
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:36,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends what weather predicting app that you use, for sure.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,010
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple.

38
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:46,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there was a day last week where I guess the Apple app had had a little blip and it showed that the temperature here in SAC was going to be like 123 degrees.

39
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just that.

40
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just...

41
00:02:50,016 --> 00:03:17,312
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever predictive algorithm they use but that's the one probably most people see you know and it's just I they had to put out some type of like you know it was actually in the news that like hey uh they had to correct this on the if you saw it was going to be 123 degrees no it's not even though it feels like it wasn't it wasn't the app it was the source yeah the data came from yeah yeah but um but I have my ballet recital next uh next week and

42
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:45,354
[SPEAKER_01]: and thankfully it's gonna be like 95 and hopefully not outside well no it's gonna be inside it's gonna be where my last recital was and we took photos for it today and we were all super cute and I just wanted them to take a picture of me and my tutu on the floor saying this is what ballet really is like um I also want to of course introduce here at the top of the show Techmaster Loki

43
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:47,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Loki, how are you doing?

44
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,531
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your 4th of July?

45
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, you know, usual.

46
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:55,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, how was your 100th birthday of the Caesar salad acknowledgement day?

47
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Caesar Salad Acknowledgement Day?

48
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because July 4th is the birth date of the Caesar Salad.

49
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't – there are some people out there that would prefer not to celebrate the birth of this country right now in the state of affairs things are in.

50
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:15,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So some people out there were celebrating instead Caesar Salad birthday, which I can respect that.

51
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:16,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Caesar Salads are pretty amazing.

52
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:16,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean –

53
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:25,012
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're doing that, then I guess I went a couple days before that to Costco and got a Caesar salad kit.

54
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, that's sort of like it.

55
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:32,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just one of those jerks that's setting off the fireworks starting July 1st.

56
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:33,199
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

57
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:33,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

58
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, gosh.

59
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in this economy or in this heat.

60
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:37,743
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank you.

61
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:38,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell that to my neighbors.

62
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:51,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, my neighbors, on the other hand, have no qualms whatsoever about setting off illegal fireworks, which is great that I hear Sac County was going around and issuing citations.

63
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:58,498
[SPEAKER_07]: They were kind of ghosting through the neighborhoods to see who was doing it, writing it down, and mailing them a citation.

64
00:04:58,658 --> 00:05:04,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that they get that, because this is the type of neighbor that also likes to park.

65
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:08,986
[SPEAKER_07]: When their parents come to visit,

66
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And granted, we have plenty of parking in the street.

67
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,435
[SPEAKER_07]: They choose to park in the lawn.

68
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:16,439
[SPEAKER_07]: In the lawn.

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where they've been for the entire week.

70
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:20,105
[SPEAKER_07]: In the lawn.

71
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:20,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Like...

72
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:23,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Just pave it then.

73
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Pave it if you don't want, like, along there.

74
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,882
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, you park.

75
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:30,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't like that they were doing road work, because they did that too.

76
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:36,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Sac County also did road work, which they resurfaced the road.

77
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the road, I mean half of the road.

78
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Not half like, oh, we did some of the streets and not all the streets.

79
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,338
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we did half of every single street.

80
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:46,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

81
00:05:47,423 --> 00:06:02,770
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is what we're celebrating this is why people are turning to the Caesar salad and what's great though what's great about our neighborhood is like the street does not need to be resealed, the street needs to be redone, it hasn't been done it hasn't been repaved in

82
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:30,557
[SPEAKER_07]: over 15 years and it is essentially gravel it is falling apart so now it's tar with or gravel with a little bit of tar on top on one half of the street so you have one half it's really rough with tar on it another middle section that they did because they had some extra asphalt left over when they were repaving one of the major streets so they went down the center with that one and then the the right side is completely just gravel it's like it's a slope now

83
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:37,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out, everyone, we haven't been here in two weeks, and we haven't even brought up a single video game yet, and here we are with a Loki rant.

84
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, everybody.

85
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:40,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, real quick, though.

86
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:44,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to address something in chat, but I also want, Loki, what is the game playing behind you tonight?

87
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Goat Simulator 3?

88
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:48,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Goat Simulator 3.

89
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:49,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it.

90
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:50,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

91
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:56,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew it was a little more like world expanding and all that sort of thing.

92
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,896
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole intro is Half-Life 2.

93
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:00,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that's great.

94
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:11,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanted to say hello to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

95
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:17,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mike Deft is pointing out Caesar salad was made where I live, so I approve of that.

96
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Caesar salad is not an invention of the Italians.

97
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It came from Mexico in the part just south of California.

98
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where Caesar salad actually came from.

99
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:35,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we thank our friends south of us for many good delicacies we have and ruin and then enjoy up here in the north.

100
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:39,058
[SPEAKER_05]: But Caesar salad, I think we've kept pretty legit.

101
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,599
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.

102
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,740
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was just going to leave Loki and I. And we got some news on Saturday morning that really wasn't great.

104
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:19,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be quite honest, I was like, my tummy hurty, but also I was just like, I'm not sure I want to talk about this yet.

105
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a week now.

106
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:31,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can kind of talk a little more about it, but we lost a really good friend of the show to a battle with cancer on Saturday.

107
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:40,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And our dear friend, Eddie, known here at the Voice of Geeks Network as Lieutenant Commander Eddie because he was a co-host on a show.

108
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:41,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Now...

109
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:57,992
[SPEAKER_05]: This show stopped producing episodes five years ago, so if you've never heard of it, I don't blame you, but I know a lot of you have been following VOG Network for some time, so you probably heard at some point Eddie on that program on the Starboard Power Coupling because he loved Trek.

110
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:07,280
[SPEAKER_05]: He loved Trek, and he knew that show in and out, and he had a lot to say on the topic.

111
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:18,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And between him and Matt and then Dr. Ken, that show was always hilarious and a really fun time and a really fun and queer eye at Trek.

112
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great, great show.

113
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:24,647
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't just know Eddie from podcasting.

114
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:28,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally knew Eddie from the Rocky Horror Picture Show circa –

115
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,632
[SPEAKER_05]: The year 2000 at the Birdcage Cinemas, which no longer exists.

116
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the parking lot for a Best Buy.

117
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:38,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've known Eddie for a long time.

118
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:42,679
[SPEAKER_05]: He lived in an area that was a very rural part of Sacramento.

119
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:47,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So he would drive quite a distance, probably an hour to hang out with folks in Sacramento.

120
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:50,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a lot of memories of him from my 20s, my early 30s.

121
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:58,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as friends do sometimes, we sort of drifted into our own hobbies and different friend circles and so forth.

122
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't see him as often.

123
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was one of those things where whenever I crossed paths with Eddie, it was just an absolute delight to see him and be around him.

124
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:10,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I heard he wanted to get into podcasting, I was like, fuck yes, you have to do this.

125
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,349
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be amazing.

126
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:17,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we got, you know, 100 or however many shows they produced, great episodes of Starboard Power Coupling.

127
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just, it breaks my heart because I've been begging Matt to bring that show back for years.

128
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:24,693
[SPEAKER_05]: and every Star Trek cruise I go on with him, I'm like, when are you going to bring that show back?

129
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:37,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And it breaks my heart that it will never be what it was before with this loss and to something so frustrating as well.

130
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to defer to Loki and DarkSakura as well because you both know him.

131
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's important to know.

132
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:45,604
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew him well outside of the context of this network.

133
00:10:46,397 --> 00:11:09,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I knew him through, like, it was more through a friend of a friend type of thing, you know, like, we would hang out sometimes, I'd see him with, you know, Jim and Annie, and with them, so I'd always, like, kind of see him with other people and stuff, but yeah, it was unfortunate, like, he was, you know, battling his cancer pretty well, like, we've

134
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:15,721
[SPEAKER_05]: They thought for a while that it was going to, you know... I was fully under the impression it was gone.

135
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:22,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I knew it had come back, but there was definitely a period of time where I was like, I thought we were past this.

136
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:22,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what?

137
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:24,385
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's horrible.

138
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:34,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and so it got to a point where the chemo was damaging his liver to a point where they couldn't do it anymore because it was going to kill him forever.

139
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:58,716
[SPEAKER_07]: from liver failure and so once you get to that point where they can't do the treatments anymore there's nothing really more you can do so they put him on palliative treatments worse yeah so they put him on palliative care and he lasts a week and he was in bad shape from what I understand my wife um

140
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:05,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I was pretty close friends with Irene, so they hang out a lot and they went and visited him.

141
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not.

142
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, once again, I'm not real close friends with him.

143
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:10,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know.

144
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:14,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't make sense for me to go over there because it's mostly families and friends and stuff.

145
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But he was not in good shape at all.

146
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:19,704
[SPEAKER_07]: He was looking rough, unfortunately.

147
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:20,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm conflicted.

148
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:24,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of wanted to go out there, but at the same time, did he want me to see him like that?

149
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:33,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And as some of you know, I had a cosplay convention thing I had done, so I was exposed to COVID and legit thought I had it based on some sniffles.

150
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, but obviously I didn't want to mess with that.

151
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:40,578
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been the worst possible thing I could do, but it obviously breaks my heart.

152
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:42,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to leave him a voicemail.

153
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about what I got to do.

154
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just, yeah, it's hard.

155
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:48,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, did you have any?

156
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Every memory I have of him is of him smiling or laughing about something.

157
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,241
[SPEAKER_05]: He had such a distinctive laugh.

158
00:12:55,682 --> 00:13:01,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Even to this day, especially if I'm with Irene, if somebody says something funny, I'll be like, ha ha!

159
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that is the way he laughed, like legitimately.

160
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was so adorable.

161
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'm going to miss that tremendously for sure.

162
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:14,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember when he used to come over and we would film movies.

163
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,356
[SPEAKER_07]: We would do the Scooby-Doo nonsense.

164
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that's right!

165
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,461
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the one that got my ex to say Bog Monster.

166
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

167
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I remember that.

168
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:29,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what I would give to find that tape at this point.

169
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Walster.

170
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

171
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:34,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

172
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:35,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

173
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:44,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, obviously, we're, we're just, we're really heartbroken about it, you know, and I'm going to be honest, like last week, I also just wasn't feeling like digestively great.

174
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was just in this mindset where I'm like, I just don't I like I if I come on the show, I'm gonna have to talk about this and I wasn't ready to.

175
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a week.

176
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:52,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had enough time to process.

177
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay.

178
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:58,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm putting on a great front, but it's rough.

179
00:13:58,307 --> 00:13:59,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.

180
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:01,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you all for the lovely comments and chat.

181
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:11,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to thank you all because this would be the same, Eddie, that about four or six weeks ago, we were doing a fundraiser for, for the exact same circumstance.

182
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:16,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, at this point, the fundraiser's done.

183
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:21,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe any leftover money is going towards funeral costs at this point.

184
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:24,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, just thank you.

185
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw OLR people in there donating, so I just want to say thank you, thank you for that.

186
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it was tough.

187
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Jamie.

188
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:40,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was going to say, it's tough because he was trying to contact, like, you know, disability and everything like that through California, but...

189
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,802
[SPEAKER_07]: He had no energy to do that at all.

190
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just, it was rough.

191
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:45,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

192
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you want to say something?

193
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:52,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying I remember doing Barbara's fundraiser.

194
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:54,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

195
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the middle of my...

196
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:01,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Marathon, I found out she had died and it turned into a funeral fundraiser.

197
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

198
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:18,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like that moment was just so jarring, you know, and I can't help but think, you know, like my, my, I just, it's a hard thing to wrap one's mind around.

199
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:18,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

200
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:30,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And as somebody was pointing out to me on social media earlier because, well, unfortunately, I've got news this morning that somebody else I know passed away.

201
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:53,474
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is not somebody I was as close with as Eddie I don't have a 20 year history with this person but definitely you know again it's one of those things she was she's the host of the Love Horror Film Festival so you guys know I do a lot of hosting here locally with horror events and things like that she's the host of the flagship event so I knew her from that circle and

202
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:54,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

203
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:21,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Bloody Betty was maybe a couple years older most.

204
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:29,364
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's this weird sense of like, I'm not loving this people around me are dying feeling.

205
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:33,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize that's part of getting older, but this sucks.

206
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:35,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an easy way to put it.

207
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,091
[SPEAKER_05]: This sucks.

208
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:42,199
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know a lot of you are dealing with it too, especially around my age and probably in other situations too.

209
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:43,800
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all experienced loss of some sort.

210
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you all being there.

211
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:49,105
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about games.

212
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:49,825
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a good time.

213
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:51,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We listen to Loki rants.

214
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We laugh at the news.

215
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,711
[SPEAKER_05]: We're critical of companies when they need it in a fun way.

216
00:16:56,151 --> 00:17:00,435
[SPEAKER_05]: But we get together every Sunday night and we're here to process with each other as well.

217
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I just really, really appreciate that from all of you.

218
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,078
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a safe world.

219
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:32,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean in general I lost I wouldn't say like a close friend but someone that I knew I lost in Israel oh my god one of the people who had been videotaped being yeah I won't go too much into that but it's just it's such a shock you know the way things are and I mean and you know we're

220
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:58,378
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not like no matter how strong a person might seem personality or physically or anything there's always aspects that are going to be beyond our control so and to understand that we have that lack of control is very humbling yeah and and frightening but the the

221
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:22,558
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that we deal with this is with that empathy that we find from people who have been through these things too and to stop looking at things as us versus them or to realize that we're all people we're all people we all have a right to enjoy our lives to live

222
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:40,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Happily and honestly to have homes, to have fucking health care for one thing, you know, and just to see that people are in these situations now where they're denied the things that they need to continue living.

223
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,340
Yeah.

224
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:44,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's disgusting.

225
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:44,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.

226
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:58,130
[SPEAKER_01]: but we all could be doing something to make it better we have power we just have to take back our power and we have to be here for each other I mean that's the only way I can think of to say it

227
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to read a couple comments from chat.

228
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, just I see the love.

229
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:03,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I receive the love.

230
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:04,232
[SPEAKER_05]: We receive the love.

231
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And just sending it right back to all of you.

232
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:12,714
[SPEAKER_05]: S200 Matt in chat, I think sums it up very easy, very well saying, there is no easy way of saying or dealing with it.

233
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:16,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Best thing we can do is enjoy life and laugh as much as we can.

234
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless what happens, we're here.

235
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:25,479
[SPEAKER_05]: On an oddly related note, I want to do something a little bit out of context and out of order from what we usually do.

236
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually we take calls at the end of the show.

237
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:45,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to take a call here at the beginning of the show because this individual had reached out last week and I was open to having them on the show last week to talk about a similar shared loss, but between the weight of our own loss we were dealing with with Eddie and so forth, we didn't end up doing the show last week.

238
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,410
[SPEAKER_05]: But to kind of

239
00:19:48,150 --> 00:20:08,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of tied this back to games in a sort of way because this individual is here to talk to us about somebody in the gaming community also lost last weekend to cancer, a big hearty fuck cancer right now, and the impact that this individual had on a very specific community.

240
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to welcome to the show, Sterlok.

241
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:11,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok, are you with us?

242
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,544
[SPEAKER_04]: People gotta stop fucking dying, man.

243
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:16,886
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've been saying all day today.

244
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:18,388
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've been saying all day, day, day.

245
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:19,228
[SPEAKER_04]: This is bullshit.

246
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Sterlok is not on cam.

247
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:24,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very... Oh, sorry.

248
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:25,874
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was gonna say Sterlok is not on cam.

249
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:32,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok, if you guys are unaware, Sterlok's been calling into the show for a while, but if this is your first... First off, if this is your first episode of OLR, I'm very sorry.

250
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,522
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not all like this, but sometimes we have to process...

251
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:39,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to say, I apologize for the very heavy nature of the early show.

252
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,244
[SPEAKER_05]: We beat you to it at the beginning.

253
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:49,706
[SPEAKER_05]: The second off, Sterlok is a gamer who is blind and has called into the show before to talk to us about different types of accessibility issues.

254
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:54,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok also has a Twitch channel where you can actually see him play games.

255
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:59,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember watching you play Last of Us and you could actually see a lot of cool accessibility features in the game, which I thought was really neat.

256
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is relevant to what I'm going to talk about in a bit.

257
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:08,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to just give you the floor for a minute to talk about your friend.

258
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:20,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so... I lost my best friend of like 20 years.

259
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Same as you guys.

260
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:22,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

261
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:30,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy too, because it happened on the same day that Eddie passed.

262
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:34,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in Brandon's case it was really early in the morning.

263
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:37,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, not to get super into the weeds.

264
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:49,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I lost my best friend of about 20 years, super blind man, real name Brandon Cole.

265
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brandon Cole was a very, very special person.

266
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just to me, but to the blind community at large.

267
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:12,805
[SPEAKER_04]: He always had a passion for being able to play games and reaching out to developers.

268
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,827
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually got that chance.

269
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,649
[SPEAKER_04]: He lived his dream job.

270
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,910
[SPEAKER_04]: This was literally his dream job.

271
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:33,095
[SPEAKER_04]: He was an accessibility consultant, specifically for total blind accessibility in video games.

272
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:39,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And he worked on The Last of Us 2, and by extension, the first one.

273
00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:43,700
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was mostly, they kind of took what they already had.

274
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:49,265
[SPEAKER_04]: New from Part 2 and applied it to the first one.

275
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:56,629
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, it's because of him that we can play The Last of Us and the new Forza.

276
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:01,612
[SPEAKER_04]: He worked on the new Forza extensively for like two years with Turn 10.

277
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:09,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he affected a lot of people.

278
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:39,410
[SPEAKER_04]: and the blind community especially but not just that but his stuff what Brandon did I think really kind of started a seismic shift in the industry at large that's the reason God of War Ragnarok had the accessibility features it did

279
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:55,881
[SPEAKER_04]: um unfortunately that was it didn't work out as well because they didn't actually use him and they just kind of thought they could wing it um didn't really work all that well but

280
00:23:56,638 --> 00:24:02,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, they tried, you know, and people are starting to see, like, oh, this is possible.

281
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Brandon was in, I think, 2014 when he first approached, I think it was, it was for Grand Theft Auto 4 or 5.

282
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:15,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

283
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,962
[SPEAKER_04]: and he asked if there would be any way to add accessibility into the game.

284
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:28,263
[SPEAKER_04]: He was literally laughed at.

285
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:34,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we've come a really long way.

286
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We have come a very long way.

287
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:37,806
[SPEAKER_04]: A really long way.

288
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:56,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me, even just doing a simple search online to learn more about Brandon, you find that even on YouTube, I'm seeing several people on YouTube are doing condolence videos and tribute videos this week just to show the impact that Brandon had.

289
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,526
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see some of his impact.

290
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,669
[SPEAKER_05]: He did have a Twitter account at SuperBlindMan, all in one word.

291
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,193
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't usually encourage going to Twitter, but I will make an exception this one time.

292
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:11,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that he had worked on Last of Us, Mortal Kombat 1, Forza.

293
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,299
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a streamer here on Twitch as well.

294
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Also with the YouTube channel, if you want to see some of his contributions at SuperBlindMan.

295
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And has a website as well.

296
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:26,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's like, you know, there was a lot of people not taking accessibility very seriously, even 10 years ago.

297
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,695
[SPEAKER_05]: My, the strides we've made, and it's because of people being loud like this that I've made it happen.

298
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:55,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, I've been proven right continuously for the past four or five years.

299
00:25:56,746 --> 00:26:01,010
[SPEAKER_04]: They say never meet your heroes, right?

300
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,553
[SPEAKER_04]: But in this case, I was best friends with my hero, so I think that's pretty awesome.

301
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:10,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Sterlach, that's a really... He will be missed.

302
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:14,103
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really loving tribute, and I don't know what else to say.

303
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:15,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry for your loss.

304
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:18,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess... Yeah, I'm sorry for your loss too, man.

305
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all going through it.

306
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:19,850
[SPEAKER_04]: This is bullshit.

307
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's... Fuck cancer.

308
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:25,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, let's destroy cancer together.

309
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:25,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we could.

310
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:31,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not to get too deep into everything that happened.

311
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, it's just crazy how fast everything happened in his case.

312
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:40,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like three months from discovery.

313
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:41,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows how long?

314
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll never know now how long he actually had it.

315
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:50,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just sitting there waiting, as cancer tends to do.

316
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:55,495
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it was so fast.

317
00:26:55,595 --> 00:27:06,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, three weeks before he passed, he was waiting to meet with his oncologist for...

318
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a treatment schedule.

319
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:18,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were just... The last voice conversation we had was we were talking about... Because we were both into wrestling.

320
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:20,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were talking about Clash at the Castle.

321
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And how awesome that was.

322
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:25,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could tell he was definitely lower energy.

323
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, of course.

324
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was still in relatively good spirits.

325
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a little on the downside.

326
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:37,008
[SPEAKER_04]: But he still had that hope there.

327
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:37,468
Yeah.

328
00:27:37,921 --> 00:28:07,588
[SPEAKER_04]: and then like a week later he was in the hospital and then just it was crazy like he just he got an infection they couldn't they couldn't get it and his kidney shut down and that was it that was just there was pretty much nothing nothing they could do from there it was just it's like you never you never know man you never know when it's gonna be your time it's insane

329
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,334
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of playing into something that Jamie was saying earlier.

330
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:16,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're all human and some of us choose to spend this time being dicks to each other.

331
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:24,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank God Super Blind Man made a much better use of his time making games more accessible to everybody.

332
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:28,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we have a saying we say a lot on this show and that is games are for everyone.

333
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:31,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't invent that saying, but we certainly adopted it.

334
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:31,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

335
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:35,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Blind Man was an important part of that.

336
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:40,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I dare say an integral part of that.

337
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:41,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's fair to say.

338
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:46,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Sterlok, I am going to let you go so we can move on with the headlines and try to...

339
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe make it a little happier show.

340
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:51,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

341
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:53,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to take this time.

342
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:58,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you taking the time and talking about a subject that is difficult here at the top of the show.

343
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:00,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for asking to come by.

344
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:01,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always a pleasure to have you.

345
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:02,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

346
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, my friend.

347
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you too.

348
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:10,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's why we didn't have a show last week.

349
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,204
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just...

350
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:17,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you need to just take a break and appreciate what's around you.

351
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:26,762
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dan used to tell me when we were early together and just talking on the phone long distance, real life must intrude.

352
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:29,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on.

353
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:40,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's impossible to transition that topic to anything else, so it's just going to be really ugly, ripping off the Band-Aid and tearing into this next topic for tonight.

354
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to talk about a little bit of last week's news.

355
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:42,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play...

356
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:44,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play an OLR game.

357
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:46,907
[SPEAKER_05]: What better way to cheer us up than play an OLR game?

358
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:47,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do a game.

359
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:55,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So we haven't done this game in a little bit, but sometimes when we miss a week, we like to do word association.

360
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:55,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm laughing.

361
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:58,456
[SPEAKER_05]: As 200 Matt says, let's throw a pie or something.

362
00:29:59,337 --> 00:30:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too hot for pie throwing.

363
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: The pie would instantly melt.

364
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:06,604
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will eat a pie.

365
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:14,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'd like to play a game called Word Association to last week's headlines.

366
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:28,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to go over some headlines from last week, and I would like those of you in chat, as well as my esteemed co-hosts here, to give us the one word that comes to your mind when you hear this headline from last week.

367
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And through that process, we will have recapped all the news from last week.

368
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:33,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound like fun?

369
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:34,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

370
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:35,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good, good.

371
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad somebody said yes.

372
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just waiting for the whole eh.

373
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Mandatory fun here at OLR.

374
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:46,318
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

375
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:48,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks Weird Al.

376
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:49,326
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

377
00:30:50,607 --> 00:31:00,396
[SPEAKER_05]: First headline is Nintendo doubling down on security following the latest video game leaker drama.

378
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:03,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this whole thing has to do with like that.

379
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:08,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember we were talking about the YouTube leaks that happened and some of that happened through Google and all this stuff.

380
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:13,407
[SPEAKER_05]: During a shareholder meeting, Nintendo was asked about these reports and basically said,

381
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:18,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the company is using outside security firms and new security measures.

382
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:21,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So one word, Nintendo doubling down on security.

383
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have to be a word?

384
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:24,972
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

385
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:27,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your show to invent your own damn rules.

386
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:31,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

387
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:33,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a raspberry.

388
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:33,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

389
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:34,876
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it could be an emotion.

390
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:35,376
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

391
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:36,917
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

392
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:39,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jamie has given a fart noise.

393
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what would be your word to wrap this up?

394
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:44,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Snipers.

395
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:55,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I think about, I think there's an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race where she goes, cue the snipers.

396
00:31:55,825 --> 00:32:01,748
[SPEAKER_05]: She's really jealous at some queen's look or something or, you know, open the trap door is another one.

397
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull the lever, Kronk.

398
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:09,302
[SPEAKER_01]: No, mine would involve a bell and just involve the word shame.

399
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:12,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

400
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,233
[SPEAKER_05]: PodCulture in chat says, same shit, different day.

401
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:18,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that pretty much wraps it up.

402
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:20,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next headline, next headline.

403
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

404
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:43,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you can do it on Steam.

405
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:48,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually record your gameplay highlights to be able to share with everybody.

406
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So your one word for Steam video game recording.

407
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:55,406
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

408
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:55,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Disable.

409
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:57,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Disable.

410
00:32:58,747 --> 00:32:59,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah.

411
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:00,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your word?

412
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Free.

413
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Free!

414
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:08,533
[SPEAKER_05]: My word would be

415
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Memory Hog.

416
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:12,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hyphenated.

417
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:20,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends on if you actually use memory as RAM or storage.

418
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:20,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

419
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,722
[SPEAKER_05]: How to kill an SSD in eight easy steps.

420
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:26,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok says my word is OBS.

421
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:29,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Def says my word is great.

422
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:31,969
[SPEAKER_05]: S2100Matt says waifus.

423
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:35,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

424
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:35,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

425
00:33:36,556 --> 00:34:02,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know, it'll just go as unused as, like, the console sharing of clips, which some people do use that, I don't know, it's like, oh my god, why would they give you free things, jeez I would rather have my Twitch clips that are people who know what's funny, and then, like, me that curates mine to become my TikTok content later

426
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:06,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I think this is more like you're playing single player and something happens.

427
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:09,466
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, oh, hey, I want to share that on Instagram.

428
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Or X or Facebook.

429
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:14,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to stream this on Facebook Gaming.

430
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,612
[SPEAKER_05]: This headline is interesting.

431
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:23,537
[SPEAKER_05]: This has to do with the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake has a new producer, of course.

432
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:26,939
[SPEAKER_05]: The new producer behind the remake, because Kojima doesn't work with Konami anymore.

433
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:39,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So Noriaki Akamura has told fans in a video that he's working on this Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, and he would like to work with Kojima again on the franchise.

434
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,653
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a series called Production Hotline.

435
00:34:43,073 --> 00:35:08,176
[SPEAKER_05]: and somebody had asked if there was any chance that the original staff would return to help on the development and he basically said it's not my place to answer on this but I'd love nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again if that could happen that would be a dream by the way he does also mention the entire original team will be still credited in the credits which I will point out is a pretty cool thing if nothing else I mean the bare fucking minimum

436
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:09,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Dream

437
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:38,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreams are nice to have.

438
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:40,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're nice to have.

439
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:42,338
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't always come true.

440
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: The best part about it is... My second word?

441
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

442
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:46,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

443
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake!

444
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:58,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, the best part about working with Kojima is he has his own company, so he can hire you all when Konami fires you for some stupid reason.

445
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:03,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I don't know, you dared to credit the original cast or something.

446
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:09,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next headline.

447
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next headline.

448
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Forza Horizon 4 is disappearing.

449
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It is being delisted as of December 15th.

450
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting unlisted from gaming stores.

451
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,293
[SPEAKER_05]: The DLC is getting pulled.

452
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:21,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going away.

453
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is because of licensing.

454
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:29,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to licensing and agreements with our partners, Forza Horizon 4 will be delisted from digital platforms on December 15th, 2044.

455
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:37,937
[SPEAKER_05]: This means the game and its additional content will no longer be available for purchase through online stores.

456
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:39,277
[SPEAKER_05]: One word to sum that up.

457
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:39,958
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

458
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:41,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Shrug.

459
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:42,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Shrug.

460
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

461
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:51,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to quote chat, you know, Ranmari 2, stop killing games.

462
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:51,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

463
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:53,795
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And luckily, let's be real, just because they delist it doesn't mean the physical disks stop working.

465
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:22,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is that.

466
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:32,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But my question would be, okay, but are those same licensing agreements going to fuck us when we get to the next Xbox system and now we're talking about backwards compatibility?

467
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:35,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is why we don't have DDR.

468
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:43,378
[SPEAKER_05]: all this time, like, you know, of all the Xbox original and Xbox 360 games that you can play on a Series X, you know what you can't play?

469
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:44,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of the DDR games.

470
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,179
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?

471
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:45,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Licensing.

472
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:52,741
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid, though, because it should be licensed to the disc, not to the game system that you play the disc on.

473
00:37:52,761 --> 00:38:03,164
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, that would be the equivalent of saying, I have this movie, and I can play it in this DVD player, but when I want to go play it in my second DVD player, well, I gotta pay up.

474
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:04,024
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that...

475
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:31,168
[SPEAKER_05]: it's dumb uh next two more headlines left next headline uh the UK retailer game so the word game is a a retailer similar if you want to say to GameStop in the UK uh and game has said that they are not going to be ending physical game and hardware sales in stores apparently there's rumors going around once again uh Gfinity had reported that according to

476
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:44,157
[SPEAKER_05]: sources familiar with the plans they were going to be ending physical game sales and game actually said in a statement to Eurogamer this is categorically not true what would they have to sell at that point?

477
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:45,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Pop figs?

478
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:55,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean that's basically what GameStop is but like if you stop selling games in your game store what what else do you have to sell?

479
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean really if they're not ending it then good

480
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Good with a question mark, says DarkSakura.

481
00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

482
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:13,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess, you know, op figs, there you go, that's my word.

483
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Because once again, he stopped selling games.

484
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:23,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I'm just saying though, but it's preposterous to think that they were going to stop because what would they sell?

485
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:27,465
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like saying, our grocery store has decided to not carry food anymore.

486
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:34,133
[SPEAKER_01]: They become a mall kiosk that has nothing but online content cards.

487
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:37,756
[SPEAKER_07]: There are stores I've seen that are all pop figs.

488
00:39:39,537 --> 00:39:41,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I don't understand who's buying those.

489
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,580
[SPEAKER_07]: My kids even made this.

490
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,421
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be me.

491
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:45,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

492
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:49,684
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some that people do like to collect some of them.

493
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:50,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I have

494
00:39:52,526 --> 00:40:01,815
[SPEAKER_07]: is when I see like this limited edition pixel neon version of like the Rice Krispie mascots.

495
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:05,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Like who is collecting a Snap, Crackle, and Pop?

496
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

497
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:13,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is collecting a neon retro version of these characters?

498
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:15,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Like retro in the sense that they're like

499
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:17,233
[SPEAKER_07]: They're voxel-y.

500
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:19,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, who is collecting that?

501
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:20,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, really?

502
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:24,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep thinking of the wall of pots behind polyester when he streams.

503
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:26,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

504
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,079
[SPEAKER_05]: This is way more than a word.

505
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

506
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:36,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm with Ranmar A2 in chat, who says, GameStop would become Stop, Game would become Avoid.

507
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm going with the word Stop.

508
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's double-sided.

509
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also using the word Stop because...

510
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:51,335
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times do we have these websites reporting on these rumors and they get shut down and it's always this exact same story about some retailer?

511
00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we've heard this story four times now with different retailers.

512
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's just the UK.

513
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop.

514
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,165
[SPEAKER_01]: My earlier word goes in for this?

515
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:01,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Shrug.

516
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:03,347
[SPEAKER_05]: On that note...

517
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:05,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

518
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:26,446
[SPEAKER_05]: AI-generated art made its way into the top 300 entries.

519
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:34,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And the company has put out a statement that it is disqualifying entries that violate the contest rules.

520
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:38,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I guess some snuck in there.

521
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:46,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the Pokemon, and there's a lot of people on social media that are like, here's the original that the AI stole.

522
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:47,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what it looks like.

523
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:50,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm going to put one of these up on the screen for those of you that are watching Twitch.

524
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:57,148
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a pretty good sample here.

525
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:57,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, darn it.

526
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:58,409
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I lost it.

527
00:41:58,429 --> 00:41:58,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

528
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But you get where I'm going with this.

529
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:05,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start on this one.

530
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:06,799
[SPEAKER_05]: My word is sick.

531
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:15,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I'm using this word is because people entered an artist contest knowing they were doing this.

532
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's sick.

533
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:27,695
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you're using an unfair thing that is all sorts of morally questionable and completely against the spirit of the contest.

534
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:31,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They either don't care or don't know.

535
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:32,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first one.

536
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:34,624
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably don't care, yeah.

537
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:38,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they think that they're actual artists typing a prompt in.

538
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:40,806
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, see, I'm an artist now.

539
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:45,028
[SPEAKER_07]: People like that have their heads up their asses, so who knows.

540
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:47,629
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt's a fucking comic tonight.

541
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:49,770
[SPEAKER_05]: The word he put in was pal world.

542
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DarkSakura.

543
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:55,412
[SPEAKER_07]: It's legally distinct, okay.

544
00:42:55,452 --> 00:42:56,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Legally distinct.

545
00:42:56,392 --> 00:42:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what's your word?

546
00:42:59,597 --> 00:43:00,138
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

547
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:02,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck AI.

548
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:02,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck AI.

549
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:13,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.

550
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Did fuck Konami.

551
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:16,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we did.

552
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:20,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but my fuck is a very impactful word of fuck.

553
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck the fucking fuckers.

554
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:30,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on to something I forgot to put on our sidebar, but it's an important segment nonetheless.

555
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:31,313
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a How Is Your Gaming Week?

556
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:34,175
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

557
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:35,576
[SPEAKER_05]: How is your gaming week, DarkSakura?

558
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:38,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So much dead by daylight.

559
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:40,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So much.

560
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,161
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got all the stuff for the...

561
00:43:44,781 --> 00:44:11,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I also made some friends and I swift with them again I've made some new friends I mostly had pretty decent experiences there were a lot of stinkers and actually I got a notice back that someone I reported for griefing actually is being investigated so I was really happy Dead by Daylight had a

562
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:15,730
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually now sending feedback when they've investigated your reports.

563
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel a little bit better.

564
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:28,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the TWAT site that refuses to investigate things that are clearly anti-Semitic, but I digress.

565
00:44:29,172 --> 00:44:38,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I also did get back to Symphony of the Night last night, and then I reloaded from an earlier save and kind of lost a bunch of progress.

566
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:52,644
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I played Cult of the Lamb instead for a while, and I'm very happy because Friday I can go back to playing Avatar because the new DLC will be available that day, which I have already...

567
00:44:53,557 --> 00:45:18,227
[SPEAKER_01]: paid for because I got like the super ultimate edition and I'm glad it's like the season passed something or the other but I'm really excited I'm playing a stupid RuPaul's game and I need to stop because it wants me to spend money and play ads all the time but I'm really annoyed by it but I also found like another it's like another stupid little phone game but it's actually kind of cute and has like a little like

568
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:20,030
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

569
00:45:43,258 --> 00:46:05,732
[SPEAKER_01]: uh a uh a gravestone almost got knocked over on stage during the performance but due to a quick save it lived and I'm also very glad that it's over and I can focus on uh the uh new uh piece we're doing so I'm happy about that all right well let's move on to Loki your gaming week please

570
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:09,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of Minecraft.

571
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:24,966
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the Unorthoblox Season 3 World Tour for the entire week, so I've been supporting our fellow SMP players on Unorthoblox by going to all their events this entire week, and that was a lot.

572
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:29,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Also worked a bit more on the content creation stuff.

573
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:38,209
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I did play some other stuff because Steam sales so I picked up stuff including Goat Simulator 3 again.

574
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:53,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully the cloud saves for Goat Simulator 3 they are compatible between Epic Games and the Steam version so I was able to jump right in and play Goat Simulator 3 and I've pretty I mean I've beat

575
00:46:54,341 --> 00:47:12,863
[SPEAKER_07]: the actual main campaign of the game and I was trying to 100% everything and then I just started the DLC for it so it looks pretty substantial my son's already beat all of it though I bought it for him and he beat it in like a day nice

576
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:14,481
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

577
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:32,349
[SPEAKER_05]: My Game of the Week has been primarily taken over by Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail, which released in the past week, actually just before the last show, honestly, or when the last show would have been, because it was Friday the 28th, I think, that the early access happened.

578
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:34,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've pretty much been playing Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail.

579
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't beat it yet, so I'm not going to give you final thoughts on it.

580
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:39,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say early...

581
00:47:40,872 --> 00:47:48,058
[SPEAKER_05]: The good news is that the dungeon design, the battle design, the music, the graphic changes are all fantastic.

582
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:52,341
[SPEAKER_05]: These dungeons, this is some of the best gameplay the game's had, honestly.

583
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:59,687
[SPEAKER_05]: The dungeons are really well done, and I'm really excited to see what other types of content they kind of put out with this.

584
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:06,352
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics wasn't a huge overhaul, but it was enough that it's noticeable, and you kind of go, ooh, this looks a little prettier.

585
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:07,213
[SPEAKER_05]: This is fun.

586
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:07,773
[SPEAKER_05]: This is nice.

587
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:09,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that.

588
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:16,141
[SPEAKER_05]: The Not So Good is... And again, I want to be careful how far I go down this road until I actually beat the game.

589
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,364
[SPEAKER_05]: The story is weak.

590
00:48:20,946 --> 00:48:22,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in the beginning.

591
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:26,891
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like Dawn Trail... Again, I'm going to watch my words because I don't want to spoil it for anybody.

592
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:29,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But it feels like Dawn Trail is in two very specific halves.

593
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:31,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the first half...

594
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm it was rough.

595
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hard time getting through some of the content because I and you all know I stand this game.

596
00:48:39,913 --> 00:48:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Fall Fantasy 14.

597
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:46,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not love getting a cut scene where a certain thing happened.

598
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:54,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I did a quest where I was walking around the town listening to people talk about the exact same thing that had just happened in the cut scene.

599
00:48:56,106 --> 00:49:18,504
[SPEAKER_05]: and to me it was really it's been a bit of a slog to get through and I think part of the issue is that they decided at least for the parts of the game in the beginning and this is again I want to watch my mouth until I get all the way through it because it does the second half does seem to have a very different tone than the first half but you're not the main character in the first half

600
00:49:19,425 --> 00:49:27,466
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's, I think Alan, my partner put it best when I was explaining it to him and he said, what in the world of Warcraft bullshit is this?

601
00:49:28,996 --> 00:49:36,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And I laughed because a lot of times in World of Warcraft, your character was more of an observer to these other more important characters that were doing things.

602
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:40,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people are into that and that's fine for the story, but you were never a part of the story.

603
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:42,644
[SPEAKER_05]: That was never really the case in Final Fantasy XIV.

604
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:44,305
[SPEAKER_05]: You were always very central to the story.

605
00:49:44,905 --> 00:49:47,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like now that's not the case.

606
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure if that was the best.

607
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:51,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I think...

608
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,069
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

609
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: One should be.

610
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:16,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.

611
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:48,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The other game I'll mention real quick because this will surprise a lot of you.

612
00:50:48,557 --> 00:50:48,917
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

613
00:50:49,657 --> 00:50:57,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Beatmania 2DX this week because I happened to be in Concord for the day.

614
00:50:57,343 --> 00:51:02,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan and I went to our closest Betty Hana, which is no longer here locally because it closed.

615
00:51:02,787 --> 00:51:02,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

616
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:06,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went to our closest Betty Hana in Concord for lunch.

617
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,291
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

618
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,244
[SPEAKER_05]: for a good period of time.

619
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:43,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but because we were down the street from Sun Valley Mall, we were like, you know what?

620
00:51:43,204 --> 00:51:44,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go see what's going on over there.

621
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:45,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to round one.

622
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what bullshit we can spend our money on.

623
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:50,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were at round one, and they had a Beatmania 2DX.

624
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:52,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what they're called.

625
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:53,193
[SPEAKER_05]: 31st Style.

626
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:58,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in chat will correct me, but I play Beatmania 2DX 31st Style, whichever that one is.

627
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:01,081
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually forced myself to do...

628
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:03,460
[SPEAKER_05]: New songs.

629
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually was – usually I kind of go through the – I go through the song list.

630
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:11,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of like, oh, I'll play the old stuff.

631
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:12,330
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was going through the new songs.

632
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, this one sounds good.

633
00:52:13,471 --> 00:52:13,952
[SPEAKER_05]: This one sounds good.

634
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:14,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

635
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:15,313
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I knew somebody would know.

636
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,656
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura says Epolis?

637
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:18,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Eopolis?

638
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:19,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Epolis.

639
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:21,259
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one.

640
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,159
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

641
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,040
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

642
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

643
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,200
[SPEAKER_05]: When I played it, though, I had fun.

644
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:32,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I do oftentimes play 2DX, and I go, damn, I wish I had one closer, which is funny.

645
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:40,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I bitched for years and years about not having one of these in town, and then they finally get one at Roseville round one, and it's like, ugh.

646
00:52:41,109 --> 00:53:10,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Roseville's the other side of town like honestly it might as well be in Concord there's also a really good hibachi place by the way in Natomas so I hear okay you're gonna need to give me more details later because I think my wife has been there I think I know a place in Roseville that's really good too there's a teppanyaki out there uh yeah I believe so um there is definitely one in Roseville and I I'm a huge Benihana fan and that's usually the bar that I I

647
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:38,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're better like honestly like I keep Benihana's in a pretty high standard but Benihana is a chain restaurant at the end of the day and so I know there's people out there probably rolling their eyes and I'm holding it in this high standard but you have to understand the body craves what it can't have and that teriyaki sauce at Benihana is what I couldn't have so alright anyway for those who do not know they are called a teppanyaki yes

648
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:40,772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Orange Lounge Habachio.

649
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:41,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're calling it.

650
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

651
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:43,534
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into some news tonight.

652
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's... Ooh, that is interesting, though, what Bonds006 says in chat.

653
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:52,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Go Fest was here this weekend in New York City.

654
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:57,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, eh, to pay $30 and walk about in this heat with phone and battery pack.

655
00:53:57,144 --> 00:53:57,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

656
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard that was going on.

657
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:04,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been very light on Pokemon Go lately, to be honest.

658
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just been kind of more into Ingress and Monster Hunter now.

659
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:13,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I hurt my leg really bad while walking on Tuesday night, so I haven't been able to GPS game.

660
00:54:14,273 --> 00:54:15,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I had to get two stitches.

661
00:54:16,474 --> 00:54:17,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez, what happened?

662
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:26,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was walking in the dark like a klutz, and I was kind of looking to my left going, okay, there's the skate ramp, I know where I am, and bam!

663
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:26,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom!

664
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:48,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Slammed right into a metal skate rail at the park and it actually punctured my leg I'm gonna try to show on stream, baby Free feet tonight on OLR That's not even feet, that's a calf But, um, yeah, that's, so I have like this big old bandage Plus I had to get stitches in my middle finger

665
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,035
[SPEAKER_01]: No, seriously, it's on the inside of my finger.

666
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:56,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I had grabbed something that had a sharp edge on it, and I didn't even realize it happened until I was in BevMo.

667
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:57,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

668
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Not BevMo, but Total Wine.

669
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:03,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Shiley and I were there, and I was like, why does my hand feel... Oh, my God.

670
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:13,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, I had hydrocolloid bandages in there, so I just wrapped it up and kind of forgot about it until a week later when I found just a flap hanging there.

671
00:55:13,284 --> 00:55:13,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

672
00:55:14,424 --> 00:55:15,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down in the park.

673
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:16,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I was by myself.

674
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:17,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It was dark.

675
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all are going to think this is gross, but this is what you do.

676
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I took my shoe off.

677
00:55:22,872 --> 00:55:25,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrapped my wound in my sock.

678
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one hand wrapped around it.

679
00:55:28,256 --> 00:55:28,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bleeding.

680
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:32,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go back to the park and see if there's still bloodstains on the ground.

681
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I left a lot of blood on the ground over there.

682
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's going to be like, damn, someone got shot at the park.

683
00:55:38,845 --> 00:55:46,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to call Alan and luckily this was right near our house so he came to get me but it was still just like ugh.

684
00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:49,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like sitting there holding my leg with a sock.

685
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:50,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

686
00:55:50,632 --> 00:55:55,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, I actually keep a first aid kit on me and I have gauze and Bactrin in my purse.

687
00:55:57,055 --> 00:55:57,275
[SPEAKER_01]: That's...

688
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I need to carry my man bag more often for that reason.

689
00:56:01,745 --> 00:56:03,247
[SPEAKER_01]: You do need to carry your man bag.

690
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:09,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have like full on prescription antibiotics because they just kept prescribing them to me.

691
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat says, hopefully you put a ton of Neosporin.

692
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:16,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Alan was smart enough when he brought the band-aid to also bring the tub of Neosporin.

693
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was taken care of.

694
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:21,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not end up going to the hospital that night because I was like, I don't know if this is bad enough.

695
00:56:21,675 --> 00:56:26,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alan was going, it's only a flesh wound.

696
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:30,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But the next morning when I got in the shower, it was still bleeding.

697
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay, this isn't good.

698
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:33,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I went and got the two stitches done.

699
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:34,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

700
00:56:53,183 --> 00:56:54,023
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

701
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:16,880
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they did their thing, but we're all right.

702
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,261
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.

703
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:27,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I want to move on to the gaming news because I do want to make sure we're done by about eight o'clock tonight Pacific time just because I'm trying to juggle other plans here going on in my personal life.

704
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:31,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get into some gaming news and we'll start with Loki.

705
00:57:32,406 --> 00:57:35,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're right around the corner from a new Nintendo console.

706
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:37,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means shortages, right?

707
00:57:37,669 --> 00:57:43,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's how it's always been, that Nintendo just can't get their shit together when it comes to stocking consoles.

708
00:57:44,112 --> 00:57:47,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they want you to know that that might not be the case.

709
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:50,876
[SPEAKER_07]: At least they're asserting that it isn't, so we'll just have to take their word for it.

710
00:57:51,056 --> 00:57:58,860
[SPEAKER_07]: But, coming out of a brand new financial call, President Shintaro Furukawa

711
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:06,832
[SPEAKER_07]: was basically said that they have put measures in place to stop, to block, I guess, resellers.

712
00:58:07,793 --> 00:58:13,021
[SPEAKER_07]: And that measure is having lots of consoles, which, cool.

713
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:19,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that really blocks resellers necessarily, especially if they just buy them all up.

714
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,752
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like your thought process there.

715
00:58:22,553 --> 00:58:28,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Their reasoning for this is because when the Switch came out, there was chip shortages and stuff like that.

716
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:34,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, more recently, during COVID and whatnot, there's been some chip shortage issues.

717
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:36,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that's been resolved.

718
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:58,705
[SPEAKER_07]: so we'll see but then again also I think back to the Wii and there were shortages there too and there weren't any chip shortages and that was using old hardware so I don't know what to think we'll just have to take their word for it and see what fuck up it ends up being when it comes out

719
00:58:59,483 --> 00:59:04,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's going to be a huge demand for this thing, though, just because it's been so long since we've had Nintendo hardware.

720
00:59:04,664 --> 00:59:06,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we haven't had a handheld.

721
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:08,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because the Switch is the handheld now, right?

722
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we know we kind of brought their ecosystems together.

723
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:15,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So there hasn't been a new Nintendo system in a long time, and I feel like demand's going to be really big for this thing.

724
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:17,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Really depends on what it launches with.

725
00:59:17,806 --> 00:59:24,688
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I actually, and hot take, and not everybody's going to agree with me, I think if Metroid Prime 4 is the launch title, that's all fine and good.

726
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's going to be as much of a demand.

727
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:29,511
[SPEAKER_05]: as if let's say they launch with Mario Kart 10.

728
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:33,795
[SPEAKER_05]: If they launch with Mario Kart 10, good fucking luck getting one of these things.

729
00:59:34,276 --> 00:59:41,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be... And yes, I'm saying 10 because I believe at this point Nintendo themselves have even counted the mobile game as 9, Mario Kart Tour.

730
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:44,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be Mario Kart 10 or Mario Kart X, whatever you want to call it.

731
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that ends up being a launch title, ho, ho, ho, boy.

732
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,621
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's Metroid Prime, yes, it's going to be good, and there's an audience.

733
00:59:52,782 --> 00:59:53,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's the same audience.

734
00:59:56,044 --> 00:59:57,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not the audience for it.

735
00:59:57,646 --> 01:00:00,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Metroid, but I don't know.

736
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I like 2D Metroid.

737
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I run Nintendo, but I would think that the smart strategy, for what it's worth, you launch with a Metroid Prime 4 in summer, and then Mario Kart 10 is your holiday release, and you have your ramp.

738
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

739
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:25,485
[SPEAKER_05]: You ramp up that you know, like, okay, you're going to get the hardcore fans in the beginning, and then you ramp to, like, every fucking family in America wants Mario Kart in their home for the holiday.

740
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:31,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, I think, allows them a little more leeway to work on these production issues and that sort of thing.

741
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:32,248
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it is in launch strategy.

742
01:00:32,268 --> 01:00:33,488
[SPEAKER_07]: You launch with Animal Crossing 2.

743
01:00:33,988 --> 01:00:35,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

744
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Or whatever the next Animal Crossing is going to be.

745
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:38,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

746
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,031
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.

747
01:00:40,151 --> 01:00:41,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's way more than two.

748
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:41,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

749
01:00:42,465 --> 01:00:54,638
[SPEAKER_05]: um let's see TigerClaw says a new Mario game on the Switch 2 seems more feasible yeah I think it'll happen eventually but yeah um DJ Ranma S says we're not in a pandemic so there should be ample supply of parts to make Switch 2 consoles

750
01:00:57,557 --> 01:00:58,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You fool.

751
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:00,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you, Ranma.

752
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:01,118
[SPEAKER_05]: You fool.

753
01:01:01,298 --> 01:01:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You fool.

754
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:03,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you new?

755
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:04,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you even go here?

756
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you new here?

757
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one word.

758
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:09,821
[SPEAKER_05]: One word.

759
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Amiibo.

760
01:01:11,782 --> 01:01:12,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I got another word.

761
01:01:13,262 --> 01:01:14,283
[SPEAKER_05]: NES Classic.

762
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I got another word.

763
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Super NES Classic.

764
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:29,203
[SPEAKER_07]: The Switch, like the Wii U, like everything they've released, they have like miscalculated the number of units that they need, which is stupid.

765
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:29,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It is...

766
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,128
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

767
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're totally going to do this bullshit now.

768
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,382
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to say, oh yeah, we're producing so many units.

769
01:01:54,622 --> 01:01:55,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So many.

770
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:56,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Just all of the units.

771
01:01:56,623 --> 01:01:59,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're practically getting Trump out there going, all of the units.

772
01:01:59,184 --> 01:01:59,844
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many.

773
01:02:00,185 --> 01:02:02,446
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't believe how many units we've seen now.

774
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:04,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the most units there have ever been.

775
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And somehow there will also be not quite enough.

776
01:02:07,548 --> 01:02:09,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And there will be shortages.

777
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,350
[SPEAKER_07]: We just couldn't possibly.

778
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so popular.

779
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:11,970
[SPEAKER_07]: The demand.

780
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,031
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so popular.

781
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:16,953
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first time we've ever put out a game system where

782
01:02:17,153 --> 01:02:19,734
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we supposed to know that people wanted these things?

783
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:23,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's just, it's gonna get to a ridiculous point.

784
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:32,098
[SPEAKER_07]: All you have to know is just get your pre-orders in for that stuff when you can, and just hopefully you don't have to deal with bullshit with scalpers.

785
01:02:32,658 --> 01:02:33,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.

786
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:41,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on and talk about some goings on with video game film updates.

787
01:02:42,227 --> 01:02:54,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a couple, you know, this is all rage now ever since, you know, Last of Us has been doing well and, you know, The Witcher did well, which I know is technically a book series, but let's be real, the video games were a big part of its success as well on Netflix.

788
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,541
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

789
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,521
[SPEAKER_05]: In May 2022, Variety reported Netflix was developing a series on Horizon Zero Dawn.

790
01:03:23,201 --> 01:03:25,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was based off, you know, the success of The Last of Us.

791
01:03:26,121 --> 01:03:29,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was going to be a live action about this.

792
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:32,803
[SPEAKER_05]: However, this is an interesting reason.

793
01:03:33,323 --> 01:03:42,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of allegations made against showrunner Steve Blackman, who is attached to the project, the show is apparently now in jeopardy.

794
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:47,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackman was the vision behind the Umbrella Academy project.

795
01:03:47,505 --> 01:03:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It was reported on June 30th in a Rolling Stone report that he's facing accusations of a long history of toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behavior.

796
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:04,914
[SPEAKER_05]: He created allegedly an environment of fear and distrust, took credit for others' work, and made comments that were sexist, homophobic, and transphobic.

797
01:04:05,535 --> 01:04:07,216
[SPEAKER_05]: He is denying all of the allegations.

798
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:12,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, this is a story we hear out of Hollywood way too much.

799
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I vote to bring back stocks.

800
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:32,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

801
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:38,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, now on good news, lighter news, the Watch Dogs movie.

802
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the Ubisoft series Watch Dogs?

803
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:41,995
[SPEAKER_05]: There was two games.

804
01:04:42,615 --> 01:04:42,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Three.

805
01:04:43,615 --> 01:04:44,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a third game?

806
01:04:45,136 --> 01:04:45,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

807
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:47,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it shows you how much I pay attention to Watch Dogs.

808
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was, yeah, Watch Dogs, Watch Dogs 2, and Watch Dogs Legion.

809
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:55,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to take your word for it.

810
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:57,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Set in the UK.

811
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:01,576
[SPEAKER_07]: That one, you had all the different NPCs, like Grandma, that you could play as.

812
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:05,359
[SPEAKER_07]: They had different things, and yet they recruited a big team and stuff.

813
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:18,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, maybe a TV show could get me interested in Watch Dogs, but a TV show, or sorry, it's a film adaptation, well, that's a little shorter of a commitment, is finally actually happening.

814
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:21,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It has made its way out of Hollywood development hell.

815
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:43,222
[SPEAKER_05]: A movie remake was supposed to be happening even before the game ever released Finally, Ubisoft made an announcement on social media that filming began on the Watch Dogs movie with a clapboard that said lightscameraaction.exe and you can see on the clapboard it said Watch Dogs so it's actually a thing that's being made Who fucking cares at this point?

816
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:49,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like so... Way to strike when the iron's hot Exactly, it's like you know

817
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:53,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't care to see the movie of that.

818
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:57,376
[SPEAKER_07]: It just doesn't sound interesting.

819
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:05,221
[SPEAKER_05]: QuestBuster in chat said, Lesion also had an Idris Elba-like character you could recruit, which I promptly made my main.

820
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:09,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that has sold me on the game more than anything else said to date.

821
01:06:11,149 --> 01:06:12,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Selva is a very fine gentleman.

822
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:18,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Considering how old that game is, you probably could get it on the Steam sale.

823
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably $1.99 on Steam sale.

824
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good point.

825
01:06:21,222 --> 01:06:21,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

826
01:06:23,288 --> 01:06:50,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Legion is $5.99 Wow, okay Watch Dogs 2, only $4.99 and the original Watch Dogs $2.99 So you could buy the entire series for like $15 right now, it sounds like $12.57 Of course there's a bundle available, of course Of course there is Oh wow, let me just add it to my backlog of games I'll never play Alright, DarkSakura, let's move on to you

827
01:06:53,612 --> 01:06:56,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Nintendo is doing something right.

828
01:06:57,855 --> 01:07:07,183
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing right amongst all of this shit that they are doing with trying to protect their security.

829
01:07:08,364 --> 01:07:14,869
[SPEAKER_01]: They have officially come out saying that they are not supporting generative AI in their work.

830
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:18,672
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not going to use it at all in game development.

831
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:22,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact the

832
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:43,571
[SPEAKER_01]: The quote coming from Nintendo is that they are open to, of course, using any new technological advance, but they understand how this can get on the edge of copyright law, which, I mean, that goes hand in hand, I guess, with some of the other things they're doing to protect their IPs.

833
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:53,538
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that maybe it's them sort of putting their money where their mouth is as well, you know, that they're not going to steal

834
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:55,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Those concepts either.

835
01:07:56,414 --> 01:08:01,877
[SPEAKER_01]: The quote that I have here says, We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players.

836
01:08:02,317 --> 01:08:11,922
[SPEAKER_01]: While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone.

837
01:08:14,263 --> 01:08:20,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's interesting because I almost feel like some of Nintendo's reasoning here is it's not necessarily...

838
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:43,595
[SPEAKER_05]: what they fear about AI it's more because they don't want to put Mario and Link they don't want to put their characters into AI and have AI learn from that that there's sort of that reservation there which I find very interesting it's a good thing AI hasn't learned off of Mario or Link yet I know right but you know but I see why they don't necessarily want to embrace that

839
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:52,239
[SPEAKER_01]: They also said, and this is another quote, in the gaming industry, AI-like technologies have long been used, for example, to control the movements of opponent characters.

840
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:56,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that game development and AI technology have always had a close relationship.

841
01:08:57,281 --> 01:09:05,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that may also raise issues with intellectual property rights.

842
01:09:07,014 --> 01:09:12,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And that quote is actually really well said about how AI impacts.

843
01:09:12,137 --> 01:09:13,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see it happening in chat.

844
01:09:13,398 --> 01:09:18,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we say the word AI and there's always the, yes, no, blah, blah.

845
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:19,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing.

846
01:09:19,562 --> 01:09:20,503
[SPEAKER_05]: AI is unavoidable.

847
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:21,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to happen.

848
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,485
[SPEAKER_05]: AI is going to happen in the industry.

849
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:27,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the walls and the boundary you put around AI.

850
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:32,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And how are we using AI that I think really is what this is all about.

851
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:36,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the art generators out there we know get trained off of

852
01:09:37,114 --> 01:09:40,936
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else out there on the internet, which is not okay because people don't opt into that.

853
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:53,662
[SPEAKER_05]: But AI or machine learning as it is to execute on a company's own algorithms, that's how we're going to get to 8K graphics and bigger graphics is those sorts of tools.

854
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:56,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unavoidable to an extent at that point.

855
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, it's very specific on generative AI.

856
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:02,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that

857
01:10:07,793 --> 01:10:16,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I use AI-assisted tools sometimes in my graphic work for resizing and doing pixel-by-pixel correction.

858
01:10:17,221 --> 01:10:27,210
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tool meant to do a specific thing that could have been done by one person by hand that does not steal from other people's work.

859
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Generative AI is a completely different concept.

860
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:30,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

861
01:10:31,432 --> 01:10:35,414
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that people need to remember the difference between those.

862
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:41,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of saying AI is bad, they need to understand the layers of how AI can be used.

863
01:10:43,217 --> 01:10:43,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

864
01:10:43,818 --> 01:10:48,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, there are some generative AI that I will support.

865
01:10:49,201 --> 01:11:11,582
[SPEAKER_01]: when a company has their own pool of artists that is all in-house that trains their thing for generating artwork or say if it's in a game and they've put a pool of assets in it going on those create your character thing and they switch out eyes instead it's just you know

866
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:18,008
[SPEAKER_01]: A person, not a person, but the computer is randomly generating it based on the criteria.

867
01:11:18,428 --> 01:11:29,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be from a set data set that the machine is learning from instead of just an open, you know, bucket from the internet.

868
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:32,121
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

869
01:11:32,481 --> 01:11:35,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on to some more news for y'all.

870
01:11:35,284 --> 01:11:36,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, we'll go to you next with our next headline.

871
01:11:37,782 --> 01:11:41,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, more piracy lawsuits from Nintendo.

872
01:11:42,045 --> 01:11:43,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would have seen that coming?

873
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:51,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so Nintendo's going after some more folks regarding piracy and modded Switches.

874
01:11:51,472 --> 01:12:00,099
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, they targeted the owner of Modded Hardware, which is a site that was selling a sold or they are selling MIG devices.

875
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are like flash carts.

876
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,540
[SPEAKER_07]: for the Switch.

877
01:12:02,941 --> 01:12:10,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, the thing that probably got them in most trouble, modded Switches that included ones with pre-installed games.

878
01:12:10,906 --> 01:12:12,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

879
01:12:12,727 --> 01:12:13,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

880
01:12:13,248 --> 01:12:13,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

881
01:12:14,309 --> 01:12:15,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's legal.

882
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, they even, I guess, asked the shop to shut down.

883
01:12:21,494 --> 01:12:25,877
[SPEAKER_07]: The shop said that they agreed to do that, and then they were still up.

884
01:12:26,437 --> 01:12:27,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So, now they're getting sued.

885
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:30,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's more than fair.

886
01:12:30,643 --> 01:12:51,018
[SPEAKER_07]: The next lawsuit was for a Reddit user who goes by Archbox who runs the r slash switch piracy subreddit and aside from being an active member on there alleges that Archbox has used his position to encourage people to pirate games.

887
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:51,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Ya think?

888
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:55,131
[SPEAKER_07]: in Switch Piracy subreddit?

889
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:56,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what they do there?

890
01:12:56,273 --> 01:12:58,956
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not talking about, like, pirates who like the Switch?

891
01:13:00,317 --> 01:13:02,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Are ya sure?

892
01:13:03,942 --> 01:13:04,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Are ya sure?

893
01:13:05,744 --> 01:13:06,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Are ya ready, kids?

894
01:13:07,406 --> 01:13:12,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... So, yeah, I... This isn't surprising.

895
01:13:12,511 --> 01:13:13,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

896
01:13:14,909 --> 01:13:15,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on.

897
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to a good news.

898
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:20,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about money made for great things.

899
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:25,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we have a couple of people here at the Voice Geeks Network that are involved with this charity marathon.

900
01:13:25,513 --> 01:13:28,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, this is really a highlight of the year for many people.

901
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:33,956
[SPEAKER_05]: In some ways, it's the video game Olympics, quite frankly, with that all looming around the quarter.

902
01:13:34,296 --> 01:13:39,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of us that would rather watch people play games quickly for charity than watch, I don't know, diving.

903
01:13:39,978 --> 01:13:40,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Incorrect.

904
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:43,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to watch a dog play games for charity.

905
01:13:44,534 --> 01:13:46,135
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStoneQuick.com

906
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:11,845
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

907
01:14:29,551 --> 01:14:30,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, blindfolded.

908
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:37,917
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to, yeah, blindfolded, but he had to run through it once without the blindfold just to know, here's how I'm gonna path, here's how I'm gonna path.

909
01:14:38,178 --> 01:14:41,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like memorizing it really fast to put the blindfold on and to do it again.

910
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,521
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fucking impressive.

911
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:43,362
[SPEAKER_05]: It was impressive.

912
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a few mistakes, but when you consider he's blindfolded, that's incredible.

913
01:14:49,386 --> 01:14:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was using a lot of sound cues and stuff.

914
01:14:51,308 --> 01:14:52,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just a lot of like stunts.

915
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:57,092
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of cool stunts, just like the Olympics that people do at summer games done quick.

916
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:57,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

917
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:05,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Our pal Bobby Blackwolf goes into great detail on this on his show because he is one of the donation readers for Summer Games Done Quick.

918
01:15:06,859 --> 01:15:14,343
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, can you believe after all these years, finally, somebody forced Bobby Blackwolf to sit down and pay attention to Mass Effect 2?

919
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he was a donation reader for Mass Effect 2.

920
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:21,226
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a host.

921
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:21,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally.

922
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:23,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally.

923
01:15:24,028 --> 01:15:29,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our own voiceover guy, VXJasonXV, you heard him referenced in the intro tonight.

924
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:30,631
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also there.

925
01:15:30,691 --> 01:15:39,235
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on the safety team, so you didn't see him on camera, but the actual event that goes on there, of course, safety and security is a very important part of that, so Jason was there doing that.

926
01:15:39,695 --> 01:15:47,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And if tonight's intro sounded a little tin canny to you, it's because he recorded that on the road in Des Moines, Iowa.

927
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Des Moines, Iowa.

928
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:48,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

929
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving back from Minneapolis.

930
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:58,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, Summer Games Done Quick raised $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders.

931
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, again, the Ken Griffey Jr.

932
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:05,703
[SPEAKER_05]: run with PB was getting a lot of attention, which is good because that's

933
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:06,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Regularly.

934
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,081
[SPEAKER_05]: They are going to be doing that from the 18th to the 25th of August.

935
01:16:28,181 --> 01:16:30,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's all virtual.

936
01:16:30,602 --> 01:16:34,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I believe that's all virtual.

937
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:40,726
[SPEAKER_05]: The next live event will be, of course, Awesome Games Done Quick, which will be in the winter, and they've already announced that next year.

938
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:44,527
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be out in, I think, was it Philadelphia or Pittsburgh?

939
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:46,128
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the P Pennsylvania towns.

940
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:50,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they not doing a TwitchCon one in San Diego this year?

941
01:16:50,129 --> 01:16:50,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

942
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:52,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Does this Pittsburgh?

943
01:16:52,411 --> 01:16:56,255
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not heard on TwitchCon as of yet, to be honest.

944
01:16:56,475 --> 01:16:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, they have not announced this yet.

945
01:16:59,578 --> 01:17:00,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't know.

946
01:17:00,999 --> 01:17:07,646
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe that, you know, I never assume, but I believe it was announced pretty late in the game last year.

947
01:17:07,786 --> 01:17:08,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

948
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:12,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they may like wait a few months to announce that.

949
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:21,196
[SPEAKER_05]: MrBlackWolf is in our chat right now confirming that the Flame Fatale is still all virtual and it's Pittsburgh is the town that it's going to be in for Awesome Games Done Quick.

950
01:17:21,376 --> 01:17:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it sounds like it was a fun event.

951
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:25,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby had some fun video and all that stuff.

952
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:36,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would encourage you if you're a subscriber here on our Twitch channel to check out Bobby's episode video archive because you can actually see because there's only so much of Games Done Quick you actually see on screen.

953
01:17:36,326 --> 01:17:38,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a whole like convention.

954
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if convention is the right word.

955
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,650
[SPEAKER_05]: He's compared it to like a cruise ship.

956
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:43,211
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't sail.

957
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:46,633
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these excursions going on in different rooms.

958
01:17:46,713 --> 01:17:47,933
[SPEAKER_05]: People playing board games.

959
01:17:47,993 --> 01:17:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: People playing arcade.

960
01:17:48,754 --> 01:17:50,035
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a whole arcade set up there.

961
01:17:50,355 --> 01:17:52,556
[SPEAKER_05]: People practicing their speedruns in another room.

962
01:17:52,576 --> 01:17:57,039
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole lot going on you don't really see when you're just watching on Twitch.

963
01:17:57,099 --> 01:17:58,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like it's a lot of fun.

964
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

965
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:06,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, we also got dates for SGDQ 2025, which is essentially a comparable timeline next year.

966
01:18:06,684 --> 01:18:08,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the week after the 4th next year.

967
01:18:08,706 --> 01:18:09,606
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know the city yet.

968
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:10,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

969
01:18:11,866 --> 01:18:12,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exciting.

970
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:13,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to attend one of those one day.

971
01:18:14,428 --> 01:18:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hopefully the TwitchCon one will happen so you guys can get a little taste.

972
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what I was able to do.

973
01:18:19,872 --> 01:18:20,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, last year.

974
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:21,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

975
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:24,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well let's move on.

976
01:18:24,435 --> 01:18:27,357
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura in sad but unsurprising news?

977
01:18:29,025 --> 01:18:38,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is shutting down all Wii U servers, no multiplayer, no co-op, and there are also going to be no more Wii U repairs.

978
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:39,113
[SPEAKER_01]: End of story.

979
01:18:40,694 --> 01:18:41,215
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

980
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:43,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing more to say about it.

981
01:18:43,757 --> 01:18:49,521
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't buy the stuff on the shop anymore anyway, but again, that's a bummer for preservation, but...

982
01:18:50,322 --> 01:18:57,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I also understand that officially, when you can't get the parts anymore, then officially you can't have repair fronts anymore.

983
01:18:57,906 --> 01:19:04,950
[SPEAKER_05]: There will still be collectors, enthusiasts, hobbyists, mom and pop shops that might repair these depending on what they're comfortable with.

984
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:12,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii U is really a figment of our imagination at this point.

985
01:19:13,094 --> 01:19:16,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Nintendo would prefer for us to not think it ever happened.

986
01:19:16,636 --> 01:19:17,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have my Wii U hooked up.

987
01:19:18,803 --> 01:19:18,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

988
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh, because I don't think I've used mine since the pandemic.

989
01:19:49,003 --> 01:19:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the pandemic lockdown, whatever you want to call it.

990
01:19:51,585 --> 01:19:52,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Since those early days.

991
01:19:53,606 --> 01:19:54,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

992
01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:55,607
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

993
01:19:56,928 --> 01:20:00,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, let's go to our next story, which I think is from Loki.

994
01:20:02,412 --> 01:20:02,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

995
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:10,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, like all live service games, they just seem to die quickly.

996
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:12,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty quickly.

997
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And that, no different for Exo Primal.

998
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:17,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that game?

999
01:20:17,782 --> 01:20:19,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that game that came out a year ago?

1000
01:20:19,704 --> 01:20:20,164
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

1001
01:20:20,184 --> 01:20:27,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like mechs, but you fight dinosaurs, and when people heard Exo Primal, they were like, ooh, are we getting a new Dino Crisis game?

1002
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:28,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1003
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1004
01:20:29,804 --> 01:20:30,925
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no you're not.

1005
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:37,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, they've now said that they are done expanding the service.

1006
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:43,015
[SPEAKER_07]: That they are done with all planned exoprimal content is now complete.

1007
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:46,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And that they're going to be going back to Season 1 content.

1008
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it's done.

1009
01:20:52,382 --> 01:20:52,883
[SPEAKER_07]: They're done.

1010
01:20:55,326 --> 01:21:03,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranmari2 in chat says, I admit to playing games that are live service, like a lot of mobile rhythm games, but I also appreciate shmups for never doing that.

1011
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:08,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I can come back to Dodonpachi in 10 years, excuse me, Dodonpachi in 10 years, and it will be waiting like an old friend.

1012
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:13,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like, there's nothing wrong with playing games that are a live service.

1013
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:21,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not anything that has to be, you know, I'm not sure you were actually apologizing, but you know, I'm just saying, there is space for games live as a service.

1014
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem.

1015
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:24,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Suicide Squad Avengers

1016
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:42,799
[SPEAKER_05]: A music game?

1017
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:43,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1018
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why that's a live service.

1019
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:50,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I even admit I play things like Diablo 4 and maybe some people would even question if that needs to be a live service.

1020
01:21:51,467 --> 01:21:53,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, especially the Battle Pass element of it.

1021
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:53,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1022
01:21:54,449 --> 01:21:57,072
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they're trying to add more content with seasons and things like that.

1023
01:21:57,112 --> 01:22:04,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is when you have a lot of these big characters in the room doing these live services, it leaves very little room for new IPs.

1024
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:05,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1025
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, well, speaking of single player experiences, guess what?

1026
01:22:11,582 --> 01:22:16,584
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have been waiting a very, very, very, very, very long time for the game Kien, guess what?

1027
01:22:16,644 --> 01:22:17,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Good news.

1028
01:22:17,124 --> 01:22:18,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's finally coming out.

1029
01:22:18,425 --> 01:22:20,305
[SPEAKER_05]: This game has been delayed for 22 years.

1030
01:22:24,604 --> 01:22:27,386
[SPEAKER_05]: They started development on this game when OLR started.

1031
01:22:27,626 --> 01:22:31,649
[SPEAKER_05]: To put it into perspective, that's how fucking long this game has taken.

1032
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:39,996
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2002, some friends in Italy got together to develop an action platformer that would contain RPG parts to it.

1033
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:47,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It was being developed for the Game Boy Advance, and now it is finally launching after all of this delay.

1034
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:51,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hell, it makes Duke Nukem Forever and its 15-year delay look like nothing.

1035
01:22:51,505 --> 01:22:52,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond Good and Evil 2.

1036
01:22:52,665 --> 01:22:53,546
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there yet.

1037
01:22:53,686 --> 01:22:54,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, working on it, right?

1038
01:22:55,306 --> 01:22:59,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, a small group of friends made this game.

1039
01:22:59,347 --> 01:23:03,068
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not have experience making games, but then they worked on this game.

1040
01:23:03,088 --> 01:23:04,568
[SPEAKER_05]: There were breaks, crunching.

1041
01:23:05,089 --> 01:23:16,351
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was finished and ready to be published, but the high cost of shipping the game on Game Boy cartridges and the fact that the game may not be successful meant the publisher did not want to publish the game.

1042
01:23:16,912 --> 01:23:18,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So finally...

1043
01:23:18,852 --> 01:23:19,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1044
01:23:50,056 --> 01:23:51,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Def says, when should we release our game?

1045
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:52,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1046
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:54,780
[SPEAKER_05]: When this podcast OLR hits a thousand episodes.

1047
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,901
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll never happen, right?

1048
01:23:57,423 --> 01:23:58,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1049
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:03,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Weak, weak laughter ensues.

1050
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:06,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Bonds006 says, Half-Life 3 still going strong.

1051
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's that.

1052
01:24:07,092 --> 01:24:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that.

1053
01:24:08,706 --> 01:24:09,027
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1054
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:14,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, well, let's talk about a game that didn't happen in this segment that we do once a month.

1055
01:24:14,676 --> 01:24:17,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the classic game, but it's a different segment.

1056
01:24:17,942 --> 01:24:20,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to roll the classic bumper anyway.

1057
01:24:20,286 --> 01:24:20,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1058
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:55,215
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week all right but as mentioned DarkSakura once a month in 2024 covers a cancelled game so DarkSakura what is tonight's cancelled game of the month the cancelled game of the month is Dinosaur Planet

1059
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:57,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1060
01:24:57,212 --> 01:24:59,034
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of y'all know of Dinosaur Planet?

1061
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:05,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hand, or at least type, my hand is raised in chat, if you're in our chat.

1062
01:25:06,361 --> 01:25:13,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Dinosaur Planet is the game that eventually became Star Fox Adventures.

1063
01:25:14,788 --> 01:25:18,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, it was pretty far along, too.

1064
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:40,306
[SPEAKER_01]: but um it was in development uh between I'd say 1999 and 2000 and Rare had put out a lot of artwork and screenshots and trailers and some of the soundtrack um and you can they're still they're still out there um and Rinmari you are correct it was Star Fox Adventures anyway um

1065
01:25:42,064 --> 01:26:09,118
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the plot and settings were retained for Star Fox Adventures so there were two main characters one named Saber and another Crystal and Saber was a was a Vox who was like the son well he was a royal knight and the son of a wizard named Randorn

1066
01:26:09,938 --> 01:26:14,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Crystal is an adopted sister who is a feline character.

1067
01:26:15,622 --> 01:26:19,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And they each have their little sidekick.

1068
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:22,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have Tricky for Saber and Kite for Crystal.

1069
01:26:23,947 --> 01:26:34,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would use these characters to go through different locations in different parts of the game and switch between them using these things called Swapstones that later became Warpstones.

1070
01:26:35,154 --> 01:26:45,701
[SPEAKER_01]: and then each of the characters had their own weapons and you would just basically go through the game to try to

1071
01:26:46,932 --> 01:26:48,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Solve the story and get to the end.

1072
01:26:49,974 --> 01:26:54,216
[SPEAKER_01]: There were also some other characters.

1073
01:26:54,236 --> 01:26:55,777
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Randorn, who was the wizard.

1074
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:03,142
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going through some pretty bad grief.

1075
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:07,885
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically killed a bunch of people and saved Crystal.

1076
01:27:08,525 --> 01:27:09,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, she's a fox.

1077
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:09,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1078
01:27:09,286 --> 01:27:09,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I think...

1079
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:17,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Saber is supposed to be a wolf.

1080
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:18,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1081
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:26,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, Randorn was eventually cut from the game and he was replaced with Earthwalker.

1082
01:27:28,446 --> 01:27:30,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of different changes were going through the game.

1083
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:41,522
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of his likes in the character and the story was a drop of whiskey and one of his dislikes was hangovers.

1084
01:27:42,122 --> 01:27:43,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had a problem.

1085
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:47,143
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Jennifer, why did I say Jennifer?

1086
01:27:47,543 --> 01:28:00,366
[SPEAKER_01]: General Scales who is supposed to have been a boss in Dinosaur Planet and then they had to scrap him as a boss due to being rushed so he was never the intended final boss.

1087
01:28:01,306 --> 01:28:08,594
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you had all these characters that were pretty close to fleshed out, I would say.

1088
01:28:09,274 --> 01:28:12,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have different locations.

1089
01:28:12,598 --> 01:28:19,745
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like Thorntail Hollow, Snowhorn Waste, Ice Mountain, Dark Ice Mines, and Krazoa Palace.

1090
01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:49,687
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of different locations there were early versions of all of these that were found in the December 2000 build just in different states of completion there was a Discovery Falls in Diamond Bay that were removed locations that were similar to like Cape Claw there was a Plains area and that connects to Desert Force Point where there was another spellstone to be used all kinds of stuff

1091
01:28:50,948 --> 01:29:04,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So going into a little bit of its production, the lead engineer, Phil Tossel, said that it actually started development right after Diddy Kong Racing in 1997.

1092
01:29:05,981 --> 01:29:10,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were working on both that and Gemini toward the end of Nintendo 64's life.

1093
01:29:12,727 --> 01:29:23,991
[SPEAKER_01]: The game had changed a bunch, as I was just saying, through some of the characters, and it was eventually settled on to be an open-world adventure with two interwoven stories, hence the two characters.

1094
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:34,755
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a character named Timber, who was the tiger character from Diddy Kong Racing, and that it was planned to be RC Pro-Am 64.

1095
01:29:36,896 --> 01:29:57,744
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they you know sort of working on Donkey Kong some stuff so they decided to change it into like a prehistoric world in gameplay similar to Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and then they'd split the characters into Saber and Crystal so Saber is a wolf, Crystal is a fox and then

1096
01:29:59,534 --> 01:30:06,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, they put so much work into this, but it was intended to be Rare's last game on the Nintendo 64.

1097
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had so many goodies packed in.

1098
01:30:11,022 --> 01:30:14,865
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to use the Nintendo 64's expansion pack.

1099
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:21,730
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be a 512 megabit cartridge, which would have been the largest on the console.

1100
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:46,584
[SPEAKER_01]: but back in Kyoto Miyamoto-san had requested that Imamura Takaya to work on another Star Fox title that would leave the rail shooter genre in favor of an adventure game and so there was eventually

1101
01:30:48,764 --> 01:30:54,668
[SPEAKER_01]: As Rare was pushing Dinosaur Planet more and more and even had like a huge E3 2000 demonstration.

1102
01:30:57,865 --> 01:31:04,131
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize that Nintendo was starting to look for Star Fox.

1103
01:31:05,812 --> 01:31:16,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when they reviewed the content of Dinosaur Planet, that being Nintendo, they saw that Saber looked kind of like Fox McCloud.

1104
01:31:16,141 --> 01:31:17,602
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just very striking.

1105
01:31:18,563 --> 01:31:21,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Nintendo asked Rare to...

1106
01:31:22,907 --> 01:31:30,589
[SPEAKER_01]: keep Dinosaur Planet quiet and had a meeting with them to marry Dinosaur Planet and Star Fox.

1107
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:36,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they agreed that Star Fox Adventures Dinosaur Planet would be an N64 game.

1108
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:49,193
[SPEAKER_01]: It would maintain much of the work that had already been put into Dinosaur Planet and then they were trying to work on how to bring Fox and other characters into the game and make it fit the Star Fox canon.

1109
01:31:50,274 --> 01:31:50,574
[SPEAKER_01]: So

1110
01:31:52,290 --> 01:32:21,015
[SPEAKER_01]: they were working on it for the Nintendo 64 and then saw that this could be something that might come out for GameCube as a launch game so they of course left Saber out, made Fox McCloud the lead it had a lot of the characters left over from Dinosaur Planet like Crystal and Tricky and then basically they redesigned her to make her well, more

1111
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:22,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Foxy.

1112
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:23,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1113
01:32:23,959 --> 01:32:24,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad pun.

1114
01:32:24,741 --> 01:32:25,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1115
01:32:26,186 --> 01:32:26,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1116
01:32:27,887 --> 01:32:54,410
[SPEAKER_01]: but her whole point in being there was to attract the male gaze what else am I going to say or maybe some lady gaze but that probably wasn't their intention so at any rate Dinosaur Planet was actually dropped from the name and this one was basically like a huge departure eventually from the original concept and

1117
01:32:55,649 --> 01:33:06,094
[SPEAKER_01]: went through a bunch of different graphical upgrades for GameCube and then the game ended up being reworked to be a GameCube release and it went from there.

1118
01:33:09,255 --> 01:33:09,915
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1119
01:33:10,296 --> 01:33:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1120
01:33:11,316 --> 01:33:12,877
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, Microsoft bought Rare.

1121
01:33:14,781 --> 01:33:23,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there it is, your classic cancelled game, but it evolved into something else, but certainly not in the same form that it was the first time.

1122
01:33:24,716 --> 01:33:25,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Dinosaur Planet.

1123
01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:38,206
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little point that I wanted to say is that there was a development version for Dinosaur Planet for Nintendo 64, and I think that's the one that we're watching.

1124
01:33:39,327 --> 01:33:45,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dated December 2000 that had been leaked online from a collector in Sweden.

1125
01:33:46,355 --> 01:34:09,510
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has a unique model for Fox instead of Saber so that indicates that this transition was looking to happen well before it was going to the GameCube but yeah it's out there to play most of the game so I mean there's still a lot that's missing because it's still a developmental copy but it's out there it looks pretty fun to me

1126
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:15,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there's your cancelled game of the month.

1127
01:34:16,075 --> 01:34:21,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're gonna quickly just touch on a few more headlines and then we're gonna probably wrap it up here pretty soon.

1128
01:34:21,217 --> 01:34:22,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we'll get some release dates real quick too.

1129
01:34:23,418 --> 01:34:26,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just touch on a few quick headlines and some rapid fire news.

[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1133
01:34:53,611 --> 01:34:59,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they are working on a Crazy Taxi reboot that will be an open world MMO.

1134
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:02,420
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got AAA power behind it, so they're really gonna push it.

1135
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:04,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Set in something like California.

1136
01:35:05,723 --> 01:35:08,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like, uh, live service.

1137
01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:12,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, remember how I was just saying not everything needs to be a live service game?

1138
01:35:14,355 --> 01:35:20,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, buy the original Offspring soundtrack for just $5.99.

1139
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I should just play the game on my iPad.

1140
01:35:25,203 --> 01:35:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check out games from a time when they weren't all live service game, Atari 50, the anniversary celebration, is getting an update.

1141
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,911

1147
01:36:17,935 --> 01:36:20,276
[SPEAKER_05]: David Crane's actually going to be in this as well from Activision.

1148
01:36:20,696 --> 01:36:22,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So this sounds like it's really cool.

1149
01:36:22,656 --> 01:36:24,037
