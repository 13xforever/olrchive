5447	5772	and more.
11184	11944	Thank you for watching.
39679	41881	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41941	46123	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46263	58251	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 1010 or 1010 of our show for tonight, July the 7th of 2024.
58331	60413	We are back after an unexpected week off.
60473	61674	We'll address that in just a moment.
61714	63375	But first, I want to introduce my co-host.
63675	64796	Of course, I am Rob Roberts.
64836	65716	I'm here with you every week.
66477	67618	Joining me are my co-hosts.
69980	70601	or Jamie Summers.
72084	72705	Hello, hello.
72906	74168	I hope you are doing well.
74188	75531	I know you've had an exhausting weekend.
75551	75731	Yes.
76778	78319	Oh my god, how has it ever been?
79340	85204	It's just, on top of that, like, my AC is on, it's going out.
85324	90648	It'll stay, it'll get the house nice and cool when it's also nice and cool outside.
91369	96072	And then, um, and then it's like, ah, I know, I'm not doing it.
96653	99375	It lets out a big FFS, and then...
101060	105844	It is very, very hot in Sacramento, California, where we are based.
106144	115211	And in fact, really, I think a lot of the country, a lot of the West Coast, so like for me to say just us is really underestimating what's happening, you know, around the U.S.
115331	116152	It was 113 yesterday.
116172	117953	Yeah, it was 113 yesterday, 108 today.
118333	121255	So hence, for me, you'll notice my arcade machines are off.
121295	124178	And usually if my machines are off, that's a sign that something...
124898	130240	Bucky's going on with the weather because I pretty much keep those off when it's really hot days.
130300	134862	Even though they don't generate a lot of heat, I don't need anything extra right now.
135282	135822	No, I don't.
135862	144725	Well, apparently we're going to have a few days under 100 next week, so yay.
145485	147746	Well, okay, I lied.
147786	148826	Well, a couple of days.
149027	150407	Yeah.
150607	152908	At least it will be cooler on the day of my recital.
153228	156950	Depends what weather predicting app that you use, for sure.
157830	158010	A couple.
158030	166434	Yeah, because there was a day last week where I guess the Apple app had had a little blip and it showed that the temperature here in SAC was going to be like 123 degrees.
167235	168255	It wasn't just that.
168375	169236	It was just...
170016	197312	whatever predictive algorithm they use but that's the one probably most people see you know and it's just I they had to put out some type of like you know it was actually in the news that like hey uh they had to correct this on the if you saw it was going to be 123 degrees no it's not even though it feels like it wasn't it wasn't the app it was the source yeah the data came from yeah yeah but um but I have my ballet recital next uh next week and
198412	225354	and thankfully it's gonna be like 95 and hopefully not outside well no it's gonna be inside it's gonna be where my last recital was and we took photos for it today and we were all super cute and I just wanted them to take a picture of me and my tutu on the floor saying this is what ballet really is like um I also want to of course introduce here at the top of the show Techmaster Loki
226789	227710	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
227730	228531	How was your 4th of July?
229672	231355	Eh, you know, usual.
231595	235700	I'm sorry, how was your 100th birthday of the Caesar salad acknowledgement day?
237113	238714	Caesar Salad Acknowledgement Day?
238734	241897	Yeah, because July 4th is the birth date of the Caesar Salad.
242397	249282	And I don't – there are some people out there that would prefer not to celebrate the birth of this country right now in the state of affairs things are in.
249542	255367	So some people out there were celebrating instead Caesar Salad birthday, which I can respect that.
255447	256448	Caesar Salads are pretty amazing.
256468	256808	I mean –
258886	265012	If we're doing that, then I guess I went a couple days before that to Costco and got a Caesar salad kit.
265052	267554	So, I mean, that's sort of like it.
267674	272598	You're just one of those jerks that's setting off the fireworks starting July 1st.
272738	273199	No, I'm kidding.
273219	273559	I'm kidding.
274100	274600	Oh, gosh.
274660	276722	Not in this economy or in this heat.
276922	277743	No, thank you.
277763	278804	Tell that to my neighbors.
280045	291693	I was going to say, my neighbors, on the other hand, have no qualms whatsoever about setting off illegal fireworks, which is great that I hear Sac County was going around and issuing citations.
291733	298498	They were kind of ghosting through the neighborhoods to see who was doing it, writing it down, and mailing them a citation.
298658	304202	I hope that they get that, because this is the type of neighbor that also likes to park.
305143	308986	When their parents come to visit,
309907	312652	And granted, we have plenty of parking in the street.
313093	314435	They choose to park in the lawn.
315998	316439	In the lawn.
316840	319364	That's where they've been for the entire week.
319484	320105	In the lawn.
320446	320586	Like...
322298	323359	Just pave it then.
323699	325841	Pave it if you don't want, like, along there.
326141	326882	But no, you park.
327102	330946	And it wasn't like that they were doing road work, because they did that too.
331046	336050	Sac County also did road work, which they resurfaced the road.
336230	338352	And by the road, I mean half of the road.
338533	342116	Not half like, oh, we did some of the streets and not all the streets.
342336	344338	No, we did half of every single street.
345939	346299	Why?
347423	362770	and this is what we're celebrating this is why people are turning to the Caesar salad and what's great though what's great about our neighborhood is like the street does not need to be resealed, the street needs to be redone, it hasn't been done it hasn't been repaved in
363610	390557	over 15 years and it is essentially gravel it is falling apart so now it's tar with or gravel with a little bit of tar on top on one half of the street so you have one half it's really rough with tar on it another middle section that they did because they had some extra asphalt left over when they were repaving one of the major streets so they went down the center with that one and then the the right side is completely just gravel it's like it's a slope now
390737	397962	I just want to point out, everyone, we haven't been here in two weeks, and we haven't even brought up a single video game yet, and here we are with a Loki rant.
398042	399283	Congratulations, everybody.
399603	400323	Wait, real quick, though.
400884	404606	I want to address something in chat, but I also want, Loki, what is the game playing behind you tonight?
404866	406127	Is that Goat Simulator 3?
406668	408569	It's Goat Simulator 3.
408669	409870	I got it.
410210	410670	Okay.
411131	416194	And I knew it was a little more like world expanding and all that sort of thing.
417195	418896	The whole intro is Half-Life 2.
419216	420317	Oh my god, that's great.
421117	431504	I also wanted to say hello to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
432125	437008	And Mike Deft is pointing out Caesar salad was made where I live, so I approve of that.
437068	439790	Yes, Caesar salad is not an invention of the Italians.
440350	443191	It came from Mexico in the part just south of California.
443271	445172	So that's where Caesar salad actually came from.
445893	455717	So yeah, we thank our friends south of us for many good delicacies we have and ruin and then enjoy up here in the north.
455797	459058	But Caesar salad, I think we've kept pretty legit.
459079	459599	That's for sure.
460239	461740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
485700	491548	And so it was just going to leave Loki and I. And we got some news on Saturday morning that really wasn't great.
492168	499899	And to be quite honest, I was like, my tummy hurty, but also I was just like, I'm not sure I want to talk about this yet.
500820	501682	It's been a week now.
503214	511523	So we can kind of talk a little more about it, but we lost a really good friend of the show to a battle with cancer on Saturday.
511863	520412	And our dear friend, Eddie, known here at the Voice of Geeks Network as Lieutenant Commander Eddie because he was a co-host on a show.
520953	521093	Now...
522054	537992	This show stopped producing episodes five years ago, so if you've never heard of it, I don't blame you, but I know a lot of you have been following VOG Network for some time, so you probably heard at some point Eddie on that program on the Starboard Power Coupling because he loved Trek.
543058	547280	He loved Trek, and he knew that show in and out, and he had a lot to say on the topic.
547860	558525	And between him and Matt and then Dr. Ken, that show was always hilarious and a really fun time and a really fun and queer eye at Trek.
559085	560165	It was a great, great show.
562206	564647	But I didn't just know Eddie from podcasting.
565207	568549	I personally knew Eddie from the Rocky Horror Picture Show circa –
569269	572632	The year 2000 at the Birdcage Cinemas, which no longer exists.
572672	574173	It's the parking lot for a Best Buy.
575754	578876	So I've known Eddie for a long time.
578956	582679	He lived in an area that was a very rural part of Sacramento.
583119	587042	So he would drive quite a distance, probably an hour to hang out with folks in Sacramento.
587442	590485	But I have a lot of memories of him from my 20s, my early 30s.
592906	598427	You know, as friends do sometimes, we sort of drifted into our own hobbies and different friend circles and so forth.
598447	600207	So I didn't see him as often.
600667	606308	But it was one of those things where whenever I crossed paths with Eddie, it was just an absolute delight to see him and be around him.
606348	610289	And when I heard he wanted to get into podcasting, I was like, fuck yes, you have to do this.
610329	611349	This is going to be amazing.
611689	617350	And so we got, you know, 100 or however many shows they produced, great episodes of Starboard Power Coupling.
617410	620891	And it just, it breaks my heart because I've been begging Matt to bring that show back for years.
621671	624693	and every Star Trek cruise I go on with him, I'm like, when are you going to bring that show back?
625273	637299	And it breaks my heart that it will never be what it was before with this loss and to something so frustrating as well.
637940	641201	I want to defer to Loki and DarkSakura as well because you both know him.
641221	642122	I mean, that's important to know.
642182	645604	We knew him well outside of the context of this network.
646397	669618	Yeah, I mean, I knew him through, like, it was more through a friend of a friend type of thing, you know, like, we would hang out sometimes, I'd see him with, you know, Jim and Annie, and with them, so I'd always, like, kind of see him with other people and stuff, but yeah, it was unfortunate, like, he was, you know, battling his cancer pretty well, like, we've
670319	675721	They thought for a while that it was going to, you know... I was fully under the impression it was gone.
676062	682004	Like, I knew it had come back, but there was definitely a period of time where I was like, I thought we were past this.
682084	682444	Like, what?
683165	684385	You know, it's horrible.
684485	694710	Yeah, and so it got to a point where the chemo was damaging his liver to a point where they couldn't do it anymore because it was going to kill him forever.
695373	718716	from liver failure and so once you get to that point where they can't do the treatments anymore there's nothing really more you can do so they put him on palliative treatments worse yeah so they put him on palliative care and he lasts a week and he was in bad shape from what I understand my wife um
719343	725249	I was pretty close friends with Irene, so they hang out a lot and they went and visited him.
725649	726230	I did not.
726450	729493	I mean, once again, I'm not real close friends with him.
729694	730595	Like, I don't know.
731075	734859	It wouldn't make sense for me to go over there because it's mostly families and friends and stuff.
735399	737602	But he was not in good shape at all.
737682	739704	He was looking rough, unfortunately.
739884	740845	I'm conflicted.
740905	744947	I kind of wanted to go out there, but at the same time, did he want me to see him like that?
745248	753533	And as some of you know, I had a cosplay convention thing I had done, so I was exposed to COVID and legit thought I had it based on some sniffles.
753973	756575	I didn't, but obviously I didn't want to mess with that.
756595	760578	That would have been the worst possible thing I could do, but it obviously breaks my heart.
761658	762819	I got to leave him a voicemail.
762879	764320	That's about what I got to do.
764460	766302	So it's just, yeah, it's hard.
768138	768899	Jamie, did you have any?
768919	772160	Every memory I have of him is of him smiling or laughing about something.
772620	774241	He had such a distinctive laugh.
775682	781184	Even to this day, especially if I'm with Irene, if somebody says something funny, I'll be like, ha ha!
781324	784366	Because that is the way he laughed, like legitimately.
784406	786367	And it was so adorable.
786527	788908	And yeah, I'm going to miss that tremendously for sure.
789848	794573	Yeah, I remember when he used to come over and we would film movies.
795194	797356	We would do the Scooby-Doo nonsense.
797676	799498	Oh my god, that's right!
799698	802461	He's the one that got my ex to say Bog Monster.
802741	803422	Oh my god.
804851	806832	Oh my god, I remember that.
807052	809814	Oh, what I would give to find that tape at this point.
810574	811475	Bob Walster.
812475	813155	Oh my gosh.
814136	814616	Wow.
815116	815717	Oh my gosh.
815757	824101	So anyway, obviously, we're, we're just, we're really heartbroken about it, you know, and I'm going to be honest, like last week, I also just wasn't feeling like digestively great.
824121	829284	But I was just in this mindset where I'm like, I just don't I like I if I come on the show, I'm gonna have to talk about this and I wasn't ready to.
830564	831164	It's been a week.
831284	832465	I've had enough time to process.
832625	833805	I'm okay.
833825	838267	I'm putting on a great front, but it's rough.
838307	839547	I'm not going to lie.
839627	841527	I want to thank you all for the lovely comments and chat.
841588	851811	I also want to thank you all because this would be the same, Eddie, that about four or six weeks ago, we were doing a fundraiser for, for the exact same circumstance.
853411	856813	Obviously, at this point, the fundraiser's done.
857474	861717	And I believe any leftover money is going towards funeral costs at this point.
862638	864399	But, you know, just thank you.
864439	869382	Yeah, I saw OLR people in there donating, so I just want to say thank you, thank you for that.
870583	871364	Yeah, and it was tough.
871404	873045	Go ahead, Jamie.
873105	880110	Oh, I was going to say, it's tough because he was trying to contact, like, you know, disability and everything like that through California, but...
880680	882802	He had no energy to do that at all.
883182	884843	And it was just, it was rough.
885324	885544	Yeah.
887686	888627	Jamie, you want to say something?
889487	892890	I was just saying I remember doing Barbara's fundraiser.
893711	894031	Oh, yeah.
894051	895352	And during the middle of my...
897119	901701	Marathon, I found out she had died and it turned into a funeral fundraiser.
902001	902281	Yeah.
902781	918187	And it's just like that moment was just so jarring, you know, and I can't help but think, you know, like my, my, I just, it's a hard thing to wrap one's mind around.
918207	918427	It is.
919386	930996	And as somebody was pointing out to me on social media earlier because, well, unfortunately, I've got news this morning that somebody else I know passed away.
932874	953474	and this is not somebody I was as close with as Eddie I don't have a 20 year history with this person but definitely you know again it's one of those things she was she's the host of the Love Horror Film Festival so you guys know I do a lot of hosting here locally with horror events and things like that she's the host of the flagship event so I knew her from that circle and
953894	954054	Mm-hmm.
973547	981135	Bloody Betty was maybe a couple years older most.
981796	989364	So it's this weird sense of like, I'm not loving this people around me are dying feeling.
989404	993408	And I realize that's part of getting older, but this sucks.
993768	995490	I don't have an easy way to put it.
995550	996091	This sucks.
997895	1002199	But I know a lot of you are dealing with it too, especially around my age and probably in other situations too.
1002219	1003800	We've all experienced loss of some sort.
1005321	1008324	So I appreciate you all being there.
1008364	1009105	We talk about games.
1009145	1009825	We have a good time.
1010306	1011787	We listen to Loki rants.
1011887	1013429	We laugh at the news.
1013489	1015711	We're critical of companies when they need it in a fun way.
1016151	1020435	But we get together every Sunday night and we're here to process with each other as well.
1020475	1022937	I just really, really appreciate that from all of you.
1022957	1024078	It's not a safe world.
1025138	1052692	I mean in general I lost I wouldn't say like a close friend but someone that I knew I lost in Israel oh my god one of the people who had been videotaped being yeah I won't go too much into that but it's just it's such a shock you know the way things are and I mean and you know we're
1053582	1078378	we're not like no matter how strong a person might seem personality or physically or anything there's always aspects that are going to be beyond our control so and to understand that we have that lack of control is very humbling yeah and and frightening but the the
1079284	1102558	the way that we deal with this is with that empathy that we find from people who have been through these things too and to stop looking at things as us versus them or to realize that we're all people we're all people we all have a right to enjoy our lives to live
1104042	1120780	Happily and honestly to have homes, to have fucking health care for one thing, you know, and just to see that people are in these situations now where they're denied the things that they need to continue living.
1121140	1121340	Yeah.
1122381	1124143	And it's disgusting.
1124163	1124624	Mm hmm.
1125954	1138130	but we all could be doing something to make it better we have power we just have to take back our power and we have to be here for each other I mean that's the only way I can think of to say it
1139371	1140671	I want to read a couple comments from chat.
1140691	1142512	And again, just I see the love.
1142672	1143432	I receive the love.
1143472	1144232	We receive the love.
1144352	1145933	And just sending it right back to all of you.
1147413	1152714	S200 Matt in chat, I think sums it up very easy, very well saying, there is no easy way of saying or dealing with it.
1153115	1156135	Best thing we can do is enjoy life and laugh as much as we can.
1156615	1158176	Regardless what happens, we're here.
1160036	1165479	On an oddly related note, I want to do something a little bit out of context and out of order from what we usually do.
1165879	1167300	Usually we take calls at the end of the show.
1167340	1185869	I'm actually going to take a call here at the beginning of the show because this individual had reached out last week and I was open to having them on the show last week to talk about a similar shared loss, but between the weight of our own loss we were dealing with with Eddie and so forth, we didn't end up doing the show last week.
1186109	1187410	But to kind of
1188150	1208226	And it kind of tied this back to games in a sort of way because this individual is here to talk to us about somebody in the gaming community also lost last weekend to cancer, a big hearty fuck cancer right now, and the impact that this individual had on a very specific community.
1208306	1210948	So I want to welcome to the show, Sterlok.
1211028	1211749	Sterlok, are you with us?
1213083	1214544	People gotta stop fucking dying, man.
1215425	1216886	That's what I've been saying all day today.
1216926	1218388	That's what I've been saying all day, day, day.
1218528	1219228	This is bullshit.
1219849	1221591	Um, Sterlok is not on cam.
1221651	1224153	I'm very... Oh, sorry.
1224413	1225874	No, I was gonna say Sterlok is not on cam.
1225934	1232500	Sterlok, if you guys are unaware, Sterlok's been calling into the show for a while, but if this is your first... First off, if this is your first episode of OLR, I'm very sorry.
1232540	1234522	They're not all like this, but sometimes we have to process...
1234622	1239723	I was about to say, I apologize for the very heavy nature of the early show.
1239803	1241244	We beat you to it at the beginning.
1242544	1249706	The second off, Sterlok is a gamer who is blind and has called into the show before to talk to us about different types of accessibility issues.
1250126	1254127	Sterlok also has a Twitch channel where you can actually see him play games.
1254307	1259749	I remember watching you play Last of Us and you could actually see a lot of cool accessibility features in the game, which I thought was really neat.
1260429	1264111	Which is relevant to what I'm going to talk about in a bit.
1264412	1268414	I would like to just give you the floor for a minute to talk about your friend.
1269354	1280201	Yeah, so... I lost my best friend of like 20 years.
1280381	1281441	Same as you guys.
1282302	1282382	Um...
1285026	1290149	It's crazy too, because it happened on the same day that Eddie passed.
1292331	1294792	I think in Brandon's case it was really early in the morning.
1294832	1297494	But anyway, not to get super into the weeds.
1300075	1309861	But yeah, I lost my best friend of about 20 years, super blind man, real name Brandon Cole.
1311222	1313603	And Brandon Cole was a very, very special person.
1315360	1318461	Not just to me, but to the blind community at large.
1321602	1332805	He always had a passion for being able to play games and reaching out to developers.
1335646	1336827	He actually got that chance.
1339828	1341649	He lived his dream job.
1342310	1343910	This was literally his dream job.
1344151	1353095	He was an accessibility consultant, specifically for total blind accessibility in video games.
1353115	1359598	And he worked on The Last of Us 2, and by extension, the first one.
1359998	1363700	But that was mostly, they kind of took what they already had.
1365342	1369265	New from Part 2 and applied it to the first one.
1369345	1376629	But anyway, it's because of him that we can play The Last of Us and the new Forza.
1376709	1381612	He worked on the new Forza extensively for like two years with Turn 10.
1384314	1389157	So, you know, he affected a lot of people.
1390203	1419410	and the blind community especially but not just that but his stuff what Brandon did I think really kind of started a seismic shift in the industry at large that's the reason God of War Ragnarok had the accessibility features it did
1420815	1435881	um unfortunately that was it didn't work out as well because they didn't actually use him and they just kind of thought they could wing it um didn't really work all that well but
1436638	1442964	Hey, they tried, you know, and people are starting to see, like, oh, this is possible.
1444485	1455275	Brandon was in, I think, 2014 when he first approached, I think it was, it was for Grand Theft Auto 4 or 5.
1455316	1455436	Yeah.
1460700	1466962	and he asked if there would be any way to add accessibility into the game.
1467162	1468263	He was literally laughed at.
1470363	1474645	So, you know, we've come a really long way.
1474985	1476445	We have come a very long way.
1476925	1477806	A really long way.
1479871	1496865	It seems to me, even just doing a simple search online to learn more about Brandon, you find that even on YouTube, I'm seeing several people on YouTube are doing condolence videos and tribute videos this week just to show the impact that Brandon had.
1497425	1498526	You can see some of his impact.
1498566	1501669	He did have a Twitter account at SuperBlindMan, all in one word.
1502950	1506193	You know, I don't usually encourage going to Twitter, but I will make an exception this one time.
1507053	1511697	And you can see that he had worked on Last of Us, Mortal Kombat 1, Forza.
1512578	1514299	He was a streamer here on Twitch as well.
1514519	1517642	Also with the YouTube channel, if you want to see some of his contributions at SuperBlindMan.
1518082	1519844	And has a website as well.
1520044	1526730	And yeah, it's like, you know, there was a lot of people not taking accessibility very seriously, even 10 years ago.
1527570	1532695	My, the strides we've made, and it's because of people being loud like this that I've made it happen.
1548699	1555245	And sure enough, I've been proven right continuously for the past four or five years.
1556746	1561010	They say never meet your heroes, right?
1561090	1565553	But in this case, I was best friends with my hero, so I think that's pretty awesome.
1567575	1570158	Well, Sterlach, that's a really... He will be missed.
1570459	1574103	That's a really loving tribute, and I don't know what else to say.
1574443	1575445	I'm sorry for your loss.
1575545	1578348	I guess... Yeah, I'm sorry for your loss too, man.
1578368	1579349	We're all going through it.
1579369	1579850	This is bullshit.
1580150	1581211	Let's... Fuck cancer.
1581592	1585016	Seriously, let's destroy cancer together.
1585036	1585697	I wish we could.
1586858	1591139	I mean, not to get too deep into everything that happened.
1591479	1596501	I will say, it's just crazy how fast everything happened in his case.
1597401	1600962	It was like three months from discovery.
1601022	1601822	Who knows how long?
1602063	1606744	We'll never know now how long he actually had it.
1606784	1610005	And I was just sitting there waiting, as cancer tends to do.
1611512	1615495	But yeah, it was so fast.
1615595	1626144	Like, three weeks before he passed, he was waiting to meet with his oncologist for...
1627904	1629285	You know, a treatment schedule.
1630606	1638172	And we were just... The last voice conversation we had was we were talking about... Because we were both into wrestling.
1638953	1640334	So we were talking about Clash at the Castle.
1641555	1643296	And how awesome that was.
1643357	1645799	And you could tell he was definitely lower energy.
1646419	1647120	Because, of course.
1649942	1652404	But he was still in relatively good spirits.
1652424	1654445	He was a little on the downside.
1654546	1657008	But he still had that hope there.
1657328	1657468	Yeah.
1657921	1687588	and then like a week later he was in the hospital and then just it was crazy like he just he got an infection they couldn't they couldn't get it and his kidney shut down and that was it that was just there was pretty much nothing nothing they could do from there it was just it's like you never you never know man you never know when it's gonna be your time it's insane
1688710	1692334	and kind of playing into something that Jamie was saying earlier.
1692374	1696998	You know, we're all human and some of us choose to spend this time being dicks to each other.
1697959	1704705	But thank God Super Blind Man made a much better use of his time making games more accessible to everybody.
1704765	1708569	And, you know, we have a saying we say a lot on this show and that is games are for everyone.
1708589	1711231	We didn't invent that saying, but we certainly adopted it.
1711852	1711992	And...
1713693	1715654	Super Blind Man was an important part of that.
1717956	1720037	I dare say an integral part of that.
1720197	1721057	I think that's fair to say.
1721998	1726320	Well, Sterlok, I am going to let you go so we can move on with the headlines and try to...
1728133	1730014	Maybe make it a little happier show.
1730994	1731535	Maybe.
1732815	1733876	It's important to take this time.
1734276	1738758	So I appreciate you taking the time and talking about a subject that is difficult here at the top of the show.
1739378	1740759	Thanks for asking to come by.
1740899	1741779	It's always a pleasure to have you.
1742339	1742760	Definitely.
1743020	1743560	Take care, my friend.
1744260	1744700	Yeah, you too.
1746941	1750683	Okay, so that's why we didn't have a show last week.
1751383	1752204	There's just...
1753954	1757897	Sometimes you need to just take a break and appreciate what's around you.
1758297	1766762	As Dan used to tell me when we were early together and just talking on the phone long distance, real life must intrude.
1768444	1769766	Well, let's move on.
1769866	1780040	I know it's impossible to transition that topic to anything else, so it's just going to be really ugly, ripping off the Band-Aid and tearing into this next topic for tonight.
1780060	1782022	Going to talk about a little bit of last week's news.
1782042	1782463	We're going to play...
1783424	1784405	Let's play an OLR game.
1784685	1786907	What better way to cheer us up than play an OLR game?
1786967	1787567	Let's do a game.
1788148	1795033	So we haven't done this game in a little bit, but sometimes when we miss a week, we like to do word association.
1795053	1795654	Sorry, I'm laughing.
1795914	1798456	As 200 Matt says, let's throw a pie or something.
1799337	1800958	It's too hot for pie throwing.
1800998	1802179	The pie would instantly melt.
1805523	1806604	But I will eat a pie.
1807464	1814309	Anyway, I'd like to play a game called Word Association to last week's headlines.
1814790	1828660	So we're going to go over some headlines from last week, and I would like those of you in chat, as well as my esteemed co-hosts here, to give us the one word that comes to your mind when you hear this headline from last week.
1828760	1832503	And through that process, we will have recapped all the news from last week.
1832563	1833084	Sound like fun?
1834485	1834685	Yes.
1835006	1835806	Okay, good, good.
1835867	1837168	I'm glad somebody said yes.
1838950	1841212	I was just waiting for the whole eh.
1843995	1845937	Mandatory fun here at OLR.
1846017	1846318	All right.
1847284	1848225	Well, thanks Weird Al.
1848385	1849326	All right, here we go.
1850607	1860396	First headline is Nintendo doubling down on security following the latest video game leaker drama.
1861176	1863558	Apparently this whole thing has to do with like that.
1863598	1868182	You remember we were talking about the YouTube leaks that happened and some of that happened through Google and all this stuff.
1868763	1873407	During a shareholder meeting, Nintendo was asked about these reports and basically said,
1874487	1878249	Yeah, the company is using outside security firms and new security measures.
1878729	1881410	So one word, Nintendo doubling down on security.
1881710	1882711	Does it have to be a word?
1884472	1884972	You know what?
1885052	1887233	It's your show to invent your own damn rules.
1890914	1891635	Okay, okay.
1892495	1893215	It's a raspberry.
1893335	1893575	Sure.
1893675	1894876	No, it could be an emotion.
1894936	1895376	That's fine.
1896637	1896917	All right.
1896957	1899158	So Jamie has given a fart noise.
1899698	1901799	Loki, what would be your word to wrap this up?
1904138	1904618	Snipers.
1911562	1915685	I think about, I think there's an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race where she goes, cue the snipers.
1915825	1921748	She's really jealous at some queen's look or something or, you know, open the trap door is another one.
1923209	1924310	Pull the lever, Kronk.
1926118	1929302	No, mine would involve a bell and just involve the word shame.
1931866	1932366	Let's see.
1934850	1937233	PodCulture in chat says, same shit, different day.
1937293	1938535	Yeah, that pretty much wraps it up.
1938615	1940177	Okay, next headline, next headline.
1941278	1942199	and DarkSakura.
1961798	1963019	Well, now you can do it on Steam.
1963419	1968542	You can actually record your gameplay highlights to be able to share with everybody.
1969242	1973825	So your one word for Steam video game recording.
1974865	1975406	DarkSakura?
1975426	1975806	Disable.
1976506	1977107	Disable.
1978747	1979248	Okay, yeah.
1980088	1980849	Loki, your word?
1982950	1983290	Free.
1984030	1984451	Free!
1987612	1988533	My word would be
1990310	1991231	Memory Hog.
1991311	1992132	It's hyphenated.
1996035	2000139	Well, it depends on if you actually use memory as RAM or storage.
2000539	2000920	I guess.
2001660	2003722	How to kill an SSD in eight easy steps.
2004743	2006745	Sterlok says my word is OBS.
2007285	2009227	Mike Def says my word is great.
2010288	2011969	S2100Matt says waifus.
2015132	2015232	Okay.
2015252	2015473	Okay.
2016556	2042498	I mean, I don't know, it'll just go as unused as, like, the console sharing of clips, which some people do use that, I don't know, it's like, oh my god, why would they give you free things, jeez I would rather have my Twitch clips that are people who know what's funny, and then, like, me that curates mine to become my TikTok content later
2043601	2046804	Right, I think this is more like you're playing single player and something happens.
2046824	2049466	You're like, oh, hey, I want to share that on Instagram.
2050286	2052408	Or X or Facebook.
2052488	2054870	I want to stream this on Facebook Gaming.
2057491	2058612	This headline is interesting.
2058652	2063537	This has to do with the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake has a new producer, of course.
2063837	2066939	The new producer behind the remake, because Kojima doesn't work with Konami anymore.
2067460	2079450	So Noriaki Akamura has told fans in a video that he's working on this Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, and he would like to work with Kojima again on the franchise.
2080171	2082653	It's a series called Production Hotline.
2083073	2108176	and somebody had asked if there was any chance that the original staff would return to help on the development and he basically said it's not my place to answer on this but I'd love nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again if that could happen that would be a dream by the way he does also mention the entire original team will be still credited in the credits which I will point out is a pretty cool thing if nothing else I mean the bare fucking minimum
2109057	2109197	Dream
2137615	2138456	Dreams are nice to have.
2139336	2140357	Yeah, they're nice to have.
2140377	2142338	They don't always come true.
2142378	2144379	The best part about it is... My second word?
2144960	2145420	Oh, yes.
2146141	2146341	Sorry.
2146401	2147642	Snake!
2147662	2158749	I was going to say, the best part about working with Kojima is he has his own company, so he can hire you all when Konami fires you for some stupid reason.
2159189	2163812	Because, I don't know, you dared to credit the original cast or something.
2165749	2169190	Our next headline.
2169950	2170690	Our next headline.
2170770	2173151	Forza Horizon 4 is disappearing.
2173191	2175972	It is being delisted as of December 15th.
2176092	2179012	It's getting unlisted from gaming stores.
2179052	2180293	The DLC is getting pulled.
2180373	2181353	It is going away.
2181813	2184233	And it is because of licensing.
2184313	2189735	Due to licensing and agreements with our partners, Forza Horizon 4 will be delisted from digital platforms on December 15th, 2044.
2191235	2197937	This means the game and its additional content will no longer be available for purchase through online stores.
2198177	2199277	One word to sum that up.
2199437	2199958	DarkSakura.
2200898	2201278	Shrug.
2202378	2202678	Shrug.
2204079	2204419	Loki.
2205759	2211081	I mean, to quote chat, you know, Ranmari 2, stop killing games.
2211521	2211761	I mean...
2213035	2213795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2235840	2241565	And luckily, let's be real, just because they delist it doesn't mean the physical disks stop working.
2241705	2242445	So there is that.
2242486	2252934	But my question would be, okay, but are those same licensing agreements going to fuck us when we get to the next Xbox system and now we're talking about backwards compatibility?
2253234	2255176	Because this is why we don't have DDR.
2255876	2263378	all this time, like, you know, of all the Xbox original and Xbox 360 games that you can play on a Series X, you know what you can't play?
2263558	2264598	Any of the DDR games.
2264638	2265179	You know why?
2265319	2265919	Licensing.
2266659	2272741	It's stupid, though, because it should be licensed to the disc, not to the game system that you play the disc on.
2272761	2283164	It's just, that would be the equivalent of saying, I have this movie, and I can play it in this DVD player, but when I want to go play it in my second DVD player, well, I gotta pay up.
2283624	2284024	You know, that...
2284958	2311168	it's dumb uh next two more headlines left next headline uh the UK retailer game so the word game is a a retailer similar if you want to say to GameStop in the UK uh and game has said that they are not going to be ending physical game and hardware sales in stores apparently there's rumors going around once again uh Gfinity had reported that according to
2311948	2324157	sources familiar with the plans they were going to be ending physical game sales and game actually said in a statement to Eurogamer this is categorically not true what would they have to sell at that point?
2324698	2325378	Pop figs?
2325698	2335065	I mean that's basically what GameStop is but like if you stop selling games in your game store what what else do you have to sell?
2335366	2339709	I mean really if they're not ending it then good
2341586	2345028	Good with a question mark, says DarkSakura.
2345649	2346009	Loki?
2348491	2353955	I mean, I guess, you know, op figs, there you go, that's my word.
2354035	2356577	Because once again, he stopped selling games.
2357217	2363342	Right, I'm just saying though, but it's preposterous to think that they were going to stop because what would they sell?
2363462	2367465	That's like saying, our grocery store has decided to not carry food anymore.
2369330	2374133	They become a mall kiosk that has nothing but online content cards.
2375394	2377756	There are stores I've seen that are all pop figs.
2379537	2381819	Once again, I don't understand who's buying those.
2382419	2383580	My kids even made this.
2383600	2385421	That would be me.
2385461	2385861	I get it.
2386021	2389684	There are some that people do like to collect some of them.
2389984	2390685	Where I have
2392526	2401815	is when I see like this limited edition pixel neon version of like the Rice Krispie mascots.
2401835	2405179	Like who is collecting a Snap, Crackle, and Pop?
2405959	2407101	Snap, Crackle, and Pop.
2407301	2413607	Who is collecting a neon retro version of these characters?
2413647	2415129	Like retro in the sense that they're like
2416252	2417233	They're voxel-y.
2417473	2419054	Like, who is collecting that?
2419134	2420074	Like, really?
2420635	2424337	I keep thinking of the wall of pots behind polyester when he streams.
2425417	2426758	Okay.
2426858	2428079	This is way more than a word.
2428299	2428899	That's fine.
2429560	2436103	But I'm with Ranmar A2 in chat, who says, GameStop would become Stop, Game would become Avoid.
2436303	2437924	So yeah, I'm going with the word Stop.
2438044	2440166	Because it's double-sided.
2440266	2442107	I'm also using the word Stop because...
2442907	2451335	How many times do we have these websites reporting on these rumors and they get shut down and it's always this exact same story about some retailer?
2451756	2454899	I feel like we've heard this story four times now with different retailers.
2455079	2457462	So now it's just the UK.
2458082	2459203	Stop.
2459423	2461165	My earlier word goes in for this?
2461185	2461966	Shrug.
2462386	2463347	On that note...
2464048	2465209	Thank you for watching!
2483104	2486446	AI-generated art made its way into the top 300 entries.
2487427	2494011	And the company has put out a statement that it is disqualifying entries that violate the contest rules.
2494631	2498113	So, yeah, I guess some snuck in there.
2498273	2506018	And now the Pokemon, and there's a lot of people on social media that are like, here's the original that the AI stole.
2506098	2507059	Here's what it looks like.
2507159	2510721	Actually, I'm going to put one of these up on the screen for those of you that are watching Twitch.
2511161	2517148	This is a pretty good sample here.
2517348	2517709	Oh, darn it.
2517749	2518409	All right, I lost it.
2518429	2518770	Forget it.
2519390	2520932	But you get where I'm going with this.
2524317	2525538	I'm going to start on this one.
2525598	2526799	My word is sick.
2527280	2535946	And the reason why I'm using this word is because people entered an artist contest knowing they were doing this.
2536327	2538488	And I think that's sick.
2538588	2547695	You know you're using an unfair thing that is all sorts of morally questionable and completely against the spirit of the contest.
2548616	2551558	They either don't care or don't know.
2551658	2552379	It's the first one.
2553463	2554624	They probably don't care, yeah.
2555284	2558265	Or they think that they're actual artists typing a prompt in.
2558745	2560806	They're like, see, I'm an artist now.
2562167	2565028	People like that have their heads up their asses, so who knows.
2565728	2567629	SSJ100Matt's a fucking comic tonight.
2567969	2569770	The word he put in was pal world.
2572971	2574092	All right, DarkSakura.
2574152	2575412	It's legally distinct, okay.
2575452	2576132	Legally distinct.
2576392	2577573	DarkSakura, what's your word?
2579597	2580138	All right.
2580158	2582100	Fuck AI.
2582141	2582661	Fuck AI.
2593519	2593779	Fuck.
2594160	2595320	Did fuck Konami.
2595641	2596301	Oh yeah, we did.
2596441	2600865	Yeah, but my fuck is a very impactful word of fuck.
2602146	2604207	Fuck the fucking fuckers.
2605268	2610072	Alright, let's move on to something I forgot to put on our sidebar, but it's an important segment nonetheless.
2610152	2611313	It's a How Is Your Gaming Week?
2611673	2614175	We'll talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2614215	2615576	How is your gaming week, DarkSakura?
2616577	2618098	So much dead by daylight.
2619299	2620280	So much.
2620340	2622161	But I got all the stuff for the...
2624781	2651049	I also made some friends and I swift with them again I've made some new friends I mostly had pretty decent experiences there were a lot of stinkers and actually I got a notice back that someone I reported for griefing actually is being investigated so I was really happy Dead by Daylight had a
2652109	2655730	is actually now sending feedback when they've investigated your reports.
2657030	2658330	It makes me feel a little bit better.
2660691	2668132	Unlike the TWAT site that refuses to investigate things that are clearly anti-Semitic, but I digress.
2669172	2678694	So anyway, I also did get back to Symphony of the Night last night, and then I reloaded from an earlier save and kind of lost a bunch of progress.
2679594	2692644	So, I played Cult of the Lamb instead for a while, and I'm very happy because Friday I can go back to playing Avatar because the new DLC will be available that day, which I have already...
2693557	2718227	paid for because I got like the super ultimate edition and I'm glad it's like the season passed something or the other but I'm really excited I'm playing a stupid RuPaul's game and I need to stop because it wants me to spend money and play ads all the time but I'm really annoyed by it but I also found like another it's like another stupid little phone game but it's actually kind of cute and has like a little like
2719329	2720030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2743258	2765732	uh a uh a gravestone almost got knocked over on stage during the performance but due to a quick save it lived and I'm also very glad that it's over and I can focus on uh the uh new uh piece we're doing so I'm happy about that all right well let's move on to Loki your gaming week please
2767241	2769722	I played a lot of Minecraft.
2770162	2784966	We had the Unorthoblox Season 3 World Tour for the entire week, so I've been supporting our fellow SMP players on Unorthoblox by going to all their events this entire week, and that was a lot.
2785926	2789107	Also worked a bit more on the content creation stuff.
2791327	2798209	and then I did play some other stuff because Steam sales so I picked up stuff including Goat Simulator 3 again.
2798369	2813713	Thankfully the cloud saves for Goat Simulator 3 they are compatible between Epic Games and the Steam version so I was able to jump right in and play Goat Simulator 3 and I've pretty I mean I've beat
2814341	2832863	the actual main campaign of the game and I was trying to 100% everything and then I just started the DLC for it so it looks pretty substantial my son's already beat all of it though I bought it for him and he beat it in like a day nice
2834161	2834481	All right.
2835462	2852349	My Game of the Week has been primarily taken over by Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail, which released in the past week, actually just before the last show, honestly, or when the last show would have been, because it was Friday the 28th, I think, that the early access happened.
2852729	2854670	So I've pretty much been playing Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail.
2854730	2858491	I haven't beat it yet, so I'm not going to give you final thoughts on it.
2858631	2859892	I will say early...
2860872	2868058	The good news is that the dungeon design, the battle design, the music, the graphic changes are all fantastic.
2868118	2872341	These dungeons, this is some of the best gameplay the game's had, honestly.
2873322	2879687	The dungeons are really well done, and I'm really excited to see what other types of content they kind of put out with this.
2879767	2886352	The graphics wasn't a huge overhaul, but it was enough that it's noticeable, and you kind of go, ooh, this looks a little prettier.
2886673	2887213	This is fun.
2887253	2887773	This is nice.
2888194	2889074	So there's that.
2889815	2896141	The Not So Good is... And again, I want to be careful how far I go down this road until I actually beat the game.
2898083	2899364	The story is weak.
2900946	2902547	Especially in the beginning.
2903688	2906891	It feels like Dawn Trail... Again, I'm going to watch my words because I don't want to spoil it for anybody.
2906931	2909754	But it feels like Dawn Trail is in two very specific halves.
2910595	2911576	And in the first half...
2913027	2914388	I'm it was rough.
2915349	2919833	I had a hard time getting through some of the content because I and you all know I stand this game.
2919913	2921134	I love Fall Fantasy 14.
2921835	2926338	I did not love getting a cut scene where a certain thing happened.
2926799	2934705	And then I did a quest where I was walking around the town listening to people talk about the exact same thing that had just happened in the cut scene.
2936106	2958504	and to me it was really it's been a bit of a slog to get through and I think part of the issue is that they decided at least for the parts of the game in the beginning and this is again I want to watch my mouth until I get all the way through it because it does the second half does seem to have a very different tone than the first half but you're not the main character in the first half
2959425	2967466	and that's, I think Alan, my partner put it best when I was explaining it to him and he said, what in the world of Warcraft bullshit is this?
2968996	2976881	And I laughed because a lot of times in World of Warcraft, your character was more of an observer to these other more important characters that were doing things.
2976921	2980102	And some people are into that and that's fine for the story, but you were never a part of the story.
2980443	2982644	That was never really the case in Final Fantasy XIV.
2982724	2984305	You were always very central to the story.
2984905	2987467	And I feel like now that's not the case.
2988207	2990848	And I'm not sure if that was the best.
2990949	2991269	I think...
2991829	2993069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3015754	3016114	One should be.
3016154	3016275	Mm hmm.
3045394	3048537	The other game I'll mention real quick because this will surprise a lot of you.
3048557	3048917	You ready?
3049657	3057143	I played Beatmania 2DX this week because I happened to be in Concord for the day.
3057343	3062547	Alan and I went to our closest Betty Hana, which is no longer here locally because it closed.
3062787	3062967	Oh, man.
3063207	3066830	So we went to our closest Betty Hana in Concord for lunch.
3067370	3068291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3080083	3081244	for a good period of time.
3098539	3103064	Yeah, but because we were down the street from Sun Valley Mall, we were like, you know what?
3103204	3104505	Let's go see what's going on over there.
3104545	3105346	Let's go to round one.
3105406	3107388	Let's see what bullshit we can spend our money on.
3107968	3110230	And we were at round one, and they had a Beatmania 2DX.
3111071	3112192	I don't remember what they're called.
3112713	3113193	31st Style.
3113474	3118839	Somebody in chat will correct me, but I play Beatmania 2DX 31st Style, whichever that one is.
3119339	3121081	But I actually forced myself to do...
3122839	3123460	New songs.
3123760	3129807	And I actually was – usually I kind of go through the – I go through the song list.
3129847	3131189	I'm kind of like, oh, I'll play the old stuff.
3131209	3132330	But I was going through the new songs.
3132370	3133431	I was like, oh, this one sounds good.
3133471	3133952	This one sounds good.
3134212	3134552	Thank you.
3134572	3135313	See, I knew somebody would know.
3135333	3137656	DarkSakura says Epolis?
3138417	3138937	Eopolis?
3139318	3139638	Epolis.
3140359	3141259	That's the one.
3141739	3142159	That was it.
3142780	3144040	So, yeah.
3144640	3145180	It was fun.
3145220	3146200	When I played it, though, I had fun.
3146240	3152402	I do oftentimes play 2DX, and I go, damn, I wish I had one closer, which is funny.
3152902	3160224	I bitched for years and years about not having one of these in town, and then they finally get one at Roseville round one, and it's like, ugh.
3161109	3190434	Roseville's the other side of town like honestly it might as well be in Concord there's also a really good hibachi place by the way in Natomas so I hear okay you're gonna need to give me more details later because I think my wife has been there I think I know a place in Roseville that's really good too there's a teppanyaki out there uh yeah I believe so um there is definitely one in Roseville and I I'm a huge Benihana fan and that's usually the bar that I I
3191212	3218895	I think they're better like honestly like I keep Benihana's in a pretty high standard but Benihana is a chain restaurant at the end of the day and so I know there's people out there probably rolling their eyes and I'm holding it in this high standard but you have to understand the body craves what it can't have and that teriyaki sauce at Benihana is what I couldn't have so alright anyway for those who do not know they are called a teppanyaki yes
3219451	3220772	All right, Orange Lounge Habachio.
3220792	3221472	That's what we're calling it.
3221513	3222193	All right, let's move on.
3222213	3223534	We're going to get into some news tonight.
3224575	3229518	So let's... Ooh, that is interesting, though, what Bonds006 says in chat.
3229858	3232821	Pokemon Go Fest was here this weekend in New York City.
3232921	3237084	I was like, eh, to pay $30 and walk about in this heat with phone and battery pack.
3237144	3237404	Yeah.
3239845	3241006	Yeah, I heard that was going on.
3241166	3244308	I've been very light on Pokemon Go lately, to be honest.
3244568	3246689	I've just been kind of more into Ingress and Monster Hunter now.
3247249	3253912	Also, I hurt my leg really bad while walking on Tuesday night, so I haven't been able to GPS game.
3254273	3255913	Oh yeah, I had to get two stitches.
3256474	3257414	Jeez, what happened?
3257694	3266499	Oh, I was walking in the dark like a klutz, and I was kind of looking to my left going, okay, there's the skate ramp, I know where I am, and bam!
3266519	3266619	Boom!
3267299	3288162	Slammed right into a metal skate rail at the park and it actually punctured my leg I'm gonna try to show on stream, baby Free feet tonight on OLR That's not even feet, that's a calf But, um, yeah, that's, so I have like this big old bandage Plus I had to get stitches in my middle finger
3290154	3292035	No, seriously, it's on the inside of my finger.
3292055	3296877	I had grabbed something that had a sharp edge on it, and I didn't even realize it happened until I was in BevMo.
3297057	3297357	Oh, no.
3297377	3298758	Not BevMo, but Total Wine.
3299818	3303620	Shiley and I were there, and I was like, why does my hand feel... Oh, my God.
3304000	3313264	And thankfully, I had hydrocolloid bandages in there, so I just wrapped it up and kind of forgot about it until a week later when I found just a flap hanging there.
3313284	3313664	So...
3314424	3315885	I went down in the park.
3315966	3316786	I was by myself.
3316886	3317427	It was dark.
3317647	3320690	Y'all are going to think this is gross, but this is what you do.
3320910	3322391	I took my shoe off.
3322872	3325434	I wrapped my wound in my sock.
3326074	3328196	I have one hand wrapped around it.
3328256	3328797	It's bleeding.
3329177	3332220	I want to go back to the park and see if there's still bloodstains on the ground.
3332480	3334982	I left a lot of blood on the ground over there.
3335002	3337064	Somebody's going to be like, damn, someone got shot at the park.
3338845	3346209	I had to call Alan and luckily this was right near our house so he came to get me but it was still just like ugh.
3346229	3349271	So I'm like sitting there holding my leg with a sock.
3349811	3350091	Anyway.
3350632	3355615	Believe it or not, I actually keep a first aid kit on me and I have gauze and Bactrin in my purse.
3357055	3357275	That's...
3358860	3361705	Honestly, I need to carry my man bag more often for that reason.
3361745	3363247	You do need to carry your man bag.
3363408	3369418	And I actually have like full on prescription antibiotics because they just kept prescribing them to me.
3370369	3372750	TigerClaw in chat says, hopefully you put a ton of Neosporin.
3372811	3376312	Yes, Alan was smart enough when he brought the band-aid to also bring the tub of Neosporin.
3376673	3377473	So that was taken care of.
3377593	3381555	I did not end up going to the hospital that night because I was like, I don't know if this is bad enough.
3381675	3386618	And Alan was going, it's only a flesh wound.
3387358	3390140	But the next morning when I got in the shower, it was still bleeding.
3390220	3391541	And I was like, okay, this isn't good.
3391961	3393982	So yeah, I went and got the two stitches done.
3394042	3394843	Thanks for watching!
3413183	3414023	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3433877	3436880	So yeah, they did their thing, but we're all right.
3436900	3437261	We're good.
3437341	3447171	Anyway, I want to move on to the gaming news because I do want to make sure we're done by about eight o'clock tonight Pacific time just because I'm trying to juggle other plans here going on in my personal life.
3447352	3451136	So let's get into some gaming news and we'll start with Loki.
3452406	3455988	Alright, we're right around the corner from a new Nintendo console.
3456268	3457609	So that means shortages, right?
3457669	3463572	Because that's how it's always been, that Nintendo just can't get their shit together when it comes to stocking consoles.
3464112	3467434	Well, they want you to know that that might not be the case.
3467574	3470876	At least they're asserting that it isn't, so we'll just have to take their word for it.
3471056	3478860	But, coming out of a brand new financial call, President Shintaro Furukawa
3479560	3486832	was basically said that they have put measures in place to stop, to block, I guess, resellers.
3487793	3493021	And that measure is having lots of consoles, which, cool.
3494025	3499630	I don't think that really blocks resellers necessarily, especially if they just buy them all up.
3499790	3501752	But I like your thought process there.
3502553	3508579	Their reasoning for this is because when the Switch came out, there was chip shortages and stuff like that.
3509780	3514705	Also, more recently, during COVID and whatnot, there's been some chip shortage issues.
3515325	3516927	But now that's been resolved.
3518348	3538705	so we'll see but then again also I think back to the Wii and there were shortages there too and there weren't any chip shortages and that was using old hardware so I don't know what to think we'll just have to take their word for it and see what fuck up it ends up being when it comes out
3539483	3544624	I think there's going to be a huge demand for this thing, though, just because it's been so long since we've had Nintendo hardware.
3544664	3546084	I mean, we haven't had a handheld.
3546764	3548445	I mean, because the Switch is the handheld now, right?
3548465	3550425	Like, we know we kind of brought their ecosystems together.
3550825	3555506	So there hasn't been a new Nintendo system in a long time, and I feel like demand's going to be really big for this thing.
3556026	3557666	Really depends on what it launches with.
3557806	3564688	You know, I actually, and hot take, and not everybody's going to agree with me, I think if Metroid Prime 4 is the launch title, that's all fine and good.
3564828	3566848	I don't think that's going to be as much of a demand.
3567348	3569511	as if let's say they launch with Mario Kart 10.
3569671	3573795	If they launch with Mario Kart 10, good fucking luck getting one of these things.
3574276	3581263	It's going to be... And yes, I'm saying 10 because I believe at this point Nintendo themselves have even counted the mobile game as 9, Mario Kart Tour.
3581664	3584247	So it would be Mario Kart 10 or Mario Kart X, whatever you want to call it.
3585648	3588631	So if that ends up being a launch title, ho, ho, ho, boy.
3590019	3592621	If it's Metroid Prime, yes, it's going to be good, and there's an audience.
3592782	3593943	I don't think it's the same audience.
3596044	3597345	I'm not the audience for it.
3597646	3600168	I like Metroid, but I don't know.
3600208	3601248	I like 2D Metroid.
3601649	3615300	Not that I run Nintendo, but I would think that the smart strategy, for what it's worth, you launch with a Metroid Prime 4 in summer, and then Mario Kart 10 is your holiday release, and you have your ramp.
3615700	3616000	Right?
3616080	3625485	You ramp up that you know, like, okay, you're going to get the hardcore fans in the beginning, and then you ramp to, like, every fucking family in America wants Mario Kart in their home for the holiday.
3625625	3631167	And that, I think, allows them a little more leeway to work on these production issues and that sort of thing.
3631207	3632248	A lot of it is in launch strategy.
3632268	3633488	You launch with Animal Crossing 2.
3633988	3635669	Yeah.
3635729	3637590	Or whatever the next Animal Crossing is going to be.
3637870	3638070	Yeah.
3639551	3640031	For sure.
3640151	3641152	Because there's way more than two.
3641432	3641592	Yeah.
3642465	3654638	um let's see TigerClaw says a new Mario game on the Switch 2 seems more feasible yeah I think it'll happen eventually but yeah um DJ Ranma S says we're not in a pandemic so there should be ample supply of parts to make Switch 2 consoles
3657557	3658077	You fool.
3659218	3660258	I love you, Ranma.
3660378	3661118	You fool.
3661298	3661899	You fool.
3662519	3663059	Are you new?
3663339	3664259	Do you even go here?
3664399	3665040	Are you new here?
3665060	3668621	I got one word.
3669281	3669821	One word.
3670541	3671222	Amiibo.
3671782	3672542	I got another word.
3673262	3674283	NES Classic.
3674383	3675083	I got another word.
3675923	3677424	Super NES Classic.
3678342	3689203	The Switch, like the Wii U, like everything they've released, they have like miscalculated the number of units that they need, which is stupid.
3689604	3689864	It is...
3691287	3692128	and so on.
3709079	3711380	And they're totally going to do this bullshit now.
3711620	3714382	They're going to say, oh yeah, we're producing so many units.
3714622	3715082	So many.
3715162	3716583	Just all of the units.
3716623	3719084	And they're practically getting Trump out there going, all of the units.
3719184	3719844	There's so many.
3720185	3722446	You won't believe how many units we've seen now.
3722566	3724487	It's just the most units there have ever been.
3724787	3727368	And somehow there will also be not quite enough.
3727548	3729069	And there will be shortages.
3729109	3730350	We just couldn't possibly.
3730370	3731190	It's just so popular.
3731310	3731970	The demand.
3732010	3733031	It's just so popular.
3733631	3736953	This is the first time we've ever put out a game system where
3737153	3739734	How are we supposed to know that people wanted these things?
3740134	3743435	Like, it's just, it's gonna get to a ridiculous point.
3743655	3752098	All you have to know is just get your pre-orders in for that stuff when you can, and just hopefully you don't have to deal with bullshit with scalpers.
3752658	3753779	Yeah, for sure.
3754739	3761807	Alright, let's move on and talk about some goings on with video game film updates.
3762227	3774060	So there's a couple, you know, this is all rage now ever since, you know, Last of Us has been doing well and, you know, The Witcher did well, which I know is technically a book series, but let's be real, the video games were a big part of its success as well on Netflix.
3774580	3775541	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3797640	3802521	In May 2022, Variety reported Netflix was developing a series on Horizon Zero Dawn.
3803201	3805541	And this was based off, you know, the success of The Last of Us.
3806121	3809822	And there was going to be a live action about this.
3810222	3812803	However, this is an interesting reason.
3813323	3822144	Because of allegations made against showrunner Steve Blackman, who is attached to the project, the show is apparently now in jeopardy.
3822904	3827005	Blackman was the vision behind the Umbrella Academy project.
3827505	3836710	It was reported on June 30th in a Rolling Stone report that he's facing accusations of a long history of toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behavior.
3837150	3844914	He created allegedly an environment of fear and distrust, took credit for others' work, and made comments that were sexist, homophobic, and transphobic.
3845535	3847216	He is denying all of the allegations.
3847276	3852358	Unfortunately, this is a story we hear out of Hollywood way too much.
3854417	3855698	I vote to bring back stocks.
3872351	3872531	Yeah.
3873251	3878773	Anyway, now on good news, lighter news, the Watch Dogs movie.
3878833	3880874	Remember the Ubisoft series Watch Dogs?
3880974	3881995	There was two games.
3882615	3882915	Three.
3883615	3884475	Was there a third game?
3885136	3885356	Yes.
3885376	3887196	Well, it shows you how much I pay attention to Watch Dogs.
3887216	3891418	So there was, yeah, Watch Dogs, Watch Dogs 2, and Watch Dogs Legion.
3894210	3895111	I have to take your word for it.
3895931	3897453	Set in the UK.
3897893	3901576	That one, you had all the different NPCs, like Grandma, that you could play as.
3901596	3905359	They had different things, and yet they recruited a big team and stuff.
3906520	3918529	All right, well, maybe a TV show could get me interested in Watch Dogs, but a TV show, or sorry, it's a film adaptation, well, that's a little shorter of a commitment, is finally actually happening.
3918549	3921492	It has made its way out of Hollywood development hell.
3921892	3943222	A movie remake was supposed to be happening even before the game ever released Finally, Ubisoft made an announcement on social media that filming began on the Watch Dogs movie with a clapboard that said lightscameraaction.exe and you can see on the clapboard it said Watch Dogs so it's actually a thing that's being made Who fucking cares at this point?
3943362	3949185	It's like so... Way to strike when the iron's hot Exactly, it's like you know
3951331	3953733	I just don't care to see the movie of that.
3954433	3957376	It just doesn't sound interesting.
3958456	3965221	QuestBuster in chat said, Lesion also had an Idris Elba-like character you could recruit, which I promptly made my main.
3965861	3969284	Now that has sold me on the game more than anything else said to date.
3971149	3972891	Drew Selva is a very fine gentleman.
3974053	3978258	Considering how old that game is, you probably could get it on the Steam sale.
3978338	3980100	It's probably $1.99 on Steam sale.
3980160	3980721	It's a good point.
3981222	3981702	Good point.
3983288	4010943	Well, Legion is $5.99 Wow, okay Watch Dogs 2, only $4.99 and the original Watch Dogs $2.99 So you could buy the entire series for like $15 right now, it sounds like $12.57 Of course there's a bundle available, of course Of course there is Oh wow, let me just add it to my backlog of games I'll never play Alright, DarkSakura, let's move on to you
4013612	4016434	Well, Nintendo is doing something right.
4017855	4027183	One thing right amongst all of this shit that they are doing with trying to protect their security.
4028364	4034869	They have officially come out saying that they are not supporting generative AI in their work.
4036350	4038672	They are not going to use it at all in game development.
4040413	4042515	And in fact the
4044358	4063571	The quote coming from Nintendo is that they are open to, of course, using any new technological advance, but they understand how this can get on the edge of copyright law, which, I mean, that goes hand in hand, I guess, with some of the other things they're doing to protect their IPs.
4065232	4073538	But I also think that maybe it's them sort of putting their money where their mouth is as well, you know, that they're not going to steal
4074733	4075694	Those concepts either.
4076414	4081877	The quote that I have here says, We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players.
4082317	4091922	While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone.
4094263	4100927	I do think it's interesting because I almost feel like some of Nintendo's reasoning here is it's not necessarily...
4102148	4123595	what they fear about AI it's more because they don't want to put Mario and Link they don't want to put their characters into AI and have AI learn from that that there's sort of that reservation there which I find very interesting it's a good thing AI hasn't learned off of Mario or Link yet I know right but you know but I see why they don't necessarily want to embrace that
4124295	4132239	They also said, and this is another quote, in the gaming industry, AI-like technologies have long been used, for example, to control the movements of opponent characters.
4132779	4136621	So I believe that game development and AI technology have always had a close relationship.
4137281	4145365	Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that may also raise issues with intellectual property rights.
4147014	4152117	And that quote is actually really well said about how AI impacts.
4152137	4153338	And I see it happening in chat.
4153398	4158101	Again, we say the word AI and there's always the, yes, no, blah, blah.
4158201	4159442	And here's the thing.
4159562	4160503	AI is unavoidable.
4160703	4161544	It's going to happen.
4161924	4163485	AI is going to happen in the industry.
4163925	4167208	It's the walls and the boundary you put around AI.
4167368	4172211	And how are we using AI that I think really is what this is all about.
4172331	4176454	And a lot of the art generators out there we know get trained off of
4177114	4180936	everything else out there on the internet, which is not okay because people don't opt into that.
4181376	4193662	But AI or machine learning as it is to execute on a company's own algorithms, that's how we're going to get to 8K graphics and bigger graphics is those sorts of tools.
4194302	4196483	It's unavoidable to an extent at that point.
4198284	4201566	On top of that, it's very specific on generative AI.
4201706	4202526	I think that
4207793	4216901	I use AI-assisted tools sometimes in my graphic work for resizing and doing pixel-by-pixel correction.
4217221	4227210	That's a tool meant to do a specific thing that could have been done by one person by hand that does not steal from other people's work.
4227950	4230371	Generative AI is a completely different concept.
4230611	4230972	Good point.
4231432	4235414	So I think that people need to remember the difference between those.
4235474	4241997	Instead of saying AI is bad, they need to understand the layers of how AI can be used.
4243217	4243598	Good point.
4243818	4248180	And actually, there are some generative AI that I will support.
4249201	4271582	when a company has their own pool of artists that is all in-house that trains their thing for generating artwork or say if it's in a game and they've put a pool of assets in it going on those create your character thing and they switch out eyes instead it's just you know
4272643	4278008	A person, not a person, but the computer is randomly generating it based on the criteria.
4278428	4289779	But it has to be from a set data set that the machine is learning from instead of just an open, you know, bucket from the internet.
4291821	4292121	All right.
4292481	4295144	Well, let's move on to some more news for y'all.
4295284	4296966	And Loki, we'll go to you next with our next headline.
4297782	4301125	Yay, more piracy lawsuits from Nintendo.
4302045	4303947	Who would have seen that coming?
4305087	4311332	Anyways, so Nintendo's going after some more folks regarding piracy and modded Switches.
4311472	4320099	So first, they targeted the owner of Modded Hardware, which is a site that was selling a sold or they are selling MIG devices.
4320159	4321360	Those are like flash carts.
4321960	4322540	for the Switch.
4322941	4330026	And then, of course, the thing that probably got them in most trouble, modded Switches that included ones with pre-installed games.
4330906	4332107	Hmm.
4332727	4333128	Hmm.
4333248	4333548	Hmm.
4334309	4335850	I don't think that's legal.
4337171	4340973	So, of course, they even, I guess, asked the shop to shut down.
4341494	4345877	The shop said that they agreed to do that, and then they were still up.
4346437	4347898	So, now they're getting sued.
4349082	4350163	I think that's more than fair.
4350643	4371018	The next lawsuit was for a Reddit user who goes by Archbox who runs the r slash switch piracy subreddit and aside from being an active member on there alleges that Archbox has used his position to encourage people to pirate games.
4371258	4371739	Ya think?
4373269	4375131	in Switch Piracy subreddit?
4375492	4376213	Is that what they do there?
4376273	4378956	They're not talking about, like, pirates who like the Switch?
4380317	4382960	Um... Are ya sure?
4383942	4384782	Are ya sure?
4385744	4386825	Are ya ready, kids?
4387406	4392491	Um... So, yeah, I... This isn't surprising.
4392511	4393873	Alright.
4394909	4395669	Well, let's move on.
4395749	4398310	Let's move on to a good news.
4398370	4400791	Let's talk about money made for great things.
4401351	4405473	And, you know, we have a couple of people here at the Voice Geeks Network that are involved with this charity marathon.
4405513	4408874	And of course, this is really a highlight of the year for many people.
4409254	4413956	In some ways, it's the video game Olympics, quite frankly, with that all looming around the quarter.
4414296	4419958	I think there's a lot of us that would rather watch people play games quickly for charity than watch, I don't know, diving.
4419978	4420539	Incorrect.
4420619	4423620	I would like to watch a dog play games for charity.
4424534	4426135	GameStoneQuick.com
4450825	4451845	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4469551	4470532	Yeah, blindfolded.
4470752	4477917	He had to, yeah, blindfolded, but he had to run through it once without the blindfold just to know, here's how I'm gonna path, here's how I'm gonna path.
4478178	4481100	And it's like memorizing it really fast to put the blindfold on and to do it again.
4481160	4482521	It was fucking impressive.
4482961	4483362	It was impressive.
4483382	4488185	He had a few mistakes, but when you consider he's blindfolded, that's incredible.
4489386	4491288	So he was using a lot of sound cues and stuff.
4491308	4492889	So yeah, just a lot of like stunts.
4493289	4497092	There's a lot of cool stunts, just like the Olympics that people do at summer games done quick.
4497632	4497692	Um,
4498633	4505998	Our pal Bobby Blackwolf goes into great detail on this on his show because he is one of the donation readers for Summer Games Done Quick.
4506859	4514343	DarkSakura, can you believe after all these years, finally, somebody forced Bobby Blackwolf to sit down and pay attention to Mass Effect 2?
4517025	4519127	Because he was a donation reader for Mass Effect 2.
4520666	4521226	He's a host.
4521286	4521787	Finally.
4522107	4523367	Finally.
4524028	4529530	And then our own voiceover guy, VXJasonXV, you heard him referenced in the intro tonight.
4529870	4530631	He was also there.
4530691	4539235	He was on the safety team, so you didn't see him on camera, but the actual event that goes on there, of course, safety and security is a very important part of that, so Jason was there doing that.
4539695	4547079	And if tonight's intro sounded a little tin canny to you, it's because he recorded that on the road in Des Moines, Iowa.
4547159	4548359	Shout out to Des Moines, Iowa.
4548920	4548980	Uh...
4549961	4551383	Driving back from Minneapolis.
4551964	4558533	So anyway, Summer Games Done Quick raised $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders.
4559454	4561277	And, you know, again, the Ken Griffey Jr.
4561337	4565703	run with PB was getting a lot of attention, which is good because that's
4566184	4566404	Regularly.
4584360	4588081	They are going to be doing that from the 18th to the 25th of August.
4588181	4590122	I believe that's all virtual.
4590602	4594023	Somebody in chat can correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I believe that's all virtual.
4594464	4600726	The next live event will be, of course, Awesome Games Done Quick, which will be in the winter, and they've already announced that next year.
4600806	4604527	It's going to be out in, I think, was it Philadelphia or Pittsburgh?
4604707	4606128	One of the P Pennsylvania towns.
4606868	4610109	Are they not doing a TwitchCon one in San Diego this year?
4610129	4610269	Yeah.
4610950	4612211	Does this Pittsburgh?
4612411	4616255	We have not heard on TwitchCon as of yet, to be honest.
4616475	4619518	So, yeah, they have not announced this yet.
4619578	4620379	So we don't know.
4620999	4627646	But I believe that, you know, I never assume, but I believe it was announced pretty late in the game last year.
4627786	4628647	So we'll see.
4628667	4632130	Yeah, they may like wait a few months to announce that.
4632310	4641196	MrBlackWolf is in our chat right now confirming that the Flame Fatale is still all virtual and it's Pittsburgh is the town that it's going to be in for Awesome Games Done Quick.
4641376	4643598	So yeah, it sounds like it was a fun event.
4643918	4645839	Bobby had some fun video and all that stuff.
4646059	4656046	So I would encourage you if you're a subscriber here on our Twitch channel to check out Bobby's episode video archive because you can actually see because there's only so much of Games Done Quick you actually see on screen.
4656326	4658047	But there's a whole like convention.
4658167	4659668	Well, I don't know if convention is the right word.
4659989	4661650	He's compared it to like a cruise ship.
4662450	4663211	that doesn't sail.
4663471	4666633	There's all these excursions going on in different rooms.
4666713	4667933	People playing board games.
4667993	4668734	People playing arcade.
4668754	4670035	They had a whole arcade set up there.
4670355	4672556	People practicing their speedruns in another room.
4672576	4677039	There's a whole lot going on you don't really see when you're just watching on Twitch.
4677099	4678039	So it sounds like it's a lot of fun.
4678480	4679760	So check that out.
4679800	4686644	And yes, we also got dates for SGDQ 2025, which is essentially a comparable timeline next year.
4686684	4688385	It's the week after the 4th next year.
4688706	4689606	We don't know the city yet.
4690086	4690627	So we'll see.
4691866	4692406	It's exciting.
4692507	4693847	I'd like to attend one of those one day.
4694428	4697730	Well, hopefully the TwitchCon one will happen so you guys can get a little taste.
4697930	4699772	Because that's what I was able to do.
4699872	4700512	Yeah, last year.
4700532	4701593	It was pretty cool.
4702834	4704355	Alright, well let's move on.
4704435	4707357	DarkSakura in sad but unsurprising news?
4709025	4718132	Nintendo is shutting down all Wii U servers, no multiplayer, no co-op, and there are also going to be no more Wii U repairs.
4718613	4719113	End of story.
4720694	4721215	There it is.
4722196	4723016	Nothing more to say about it.
4723757	4729521	You can't buy the stuff on the shop anymore anyway, but again, that's a bummer for preservation, but...
4730322	4737546	I also understand that officially, when you can't get the parts anymore, then officially you can't have repair fronts anymore.
4737906	4744950	There will still be collectors, enthusiasts, hobbyists, mom and pop shops that might repair these depending on what they're comfortable with.
4745730	4752834	The Wii U is really a figment of our imagination at this point.
4753094	4756116	I think Nintendo would prefer for us to not think it ever happened.
4756636	4757837	I still have my Wii U hooked up.
4758803	4758923	Uh-oh.
4786181	4788583	Uh-oh, because I don't think I've used mine since the pandemic.
4789003	4790644	Well, the pandemic lockdown, whatever you want to call it.
4791585	4792866	Since those early days.
4793606	4794106	So we'll see.
4795307	4795607	All right.
4796928	4800491	Moving on, let's go to our next story, which I think is from Loki.
4802412	4802632	Yep.
4803673	4810778	Well, like all live service games, they just seem to die quickly.
4811937	4812658	Pretty quickly.
4813679	4816621	And that, no different for Exo Primal.
4816641	4817442	Remember that game?
4817782	4819584	Remember that game that came out a year ago?
4819704	4820164	No, I don't.
4820184	4827691	It was like mechs, but you fight dinosaurs, and when people heard Exo Primal, they were like, ooh, are we getting a new Dino Crisis game?
4827851	4828091	Nope.
4828992	4829192	Nope.
4829804	4830925	No, no you're not.
4831706	4837951	And, well, they've now said that they are done expanding the service.
4838251	4843015	That they are done with all planned exoprimal content is now complete.
4843395	4846998	And that they're going to be going back to Season 1 content.
4849800	4851682	Yeah, so it's done.
4852382	4852883	They're done.
4855326	4863031	Ranmari2 in chat says, I admit to playing games that are live service, like a lot of mobile rhythm games, but I also appreciate shmups for never doing that.
4863131	4868735	I can come back to Dodonpachi in 10 years, excuse me, Dodonpachi in 10 years, and it will be waiting like an old friend.
4869156	4873579	Yeah, like, there's nothing wrong with playing games that are a live service.
4873619	4881485	That's not anything that has to be, you know, I'm not sure you were actually apologizing, but you know, I'm just saying, there is space for games live as a service.
4881625	4882365	Here's the problem.
4883294	4884636	Suicide Squad Avengers
4901878	4902799	A music game?
4903079	4903359	Sure.
4903680	4905501	I understand why that's a live service.
4905902	4910446	I even admit I play things like Diablo 4 and maybe some people would even question if that needs to be a live service.
4911467	4913328	Well, especially the Battle Pass element of it.
4913649	4913989	I don't know.
4914449	4917072	At least they're trying to add more content with seasons and things like that.
4917112	4924779	But the problem is when you have a lot of these big characters in the room doing these live services, it leaves very little room for new IPs.
4925499	4925599	So...
4926800	4931542	Anyway, well, speaking of single player experiences, guess what?
4931582	4936584	If you have been waiting a very, very, very, very, very long time for the game Kien, guess what?
4936644	4937064	Good news.
4937124	4938084	It's finally coming out.
4938425	4940305	This game has been delayed for 22 years.
4944604	4947386	They started development on this game when OLR started.
4947626	4951649	To put it into perspective, that's how fucking long this game has taken.
4952190	4959996	In 2002, some friends in Italy got together to develop an action platformer that would contain RPG parts to it.
4960556	4967202	It was being developed for the Game Boy Advance, and now it is finally launching after all of this delay.
4967342	4971205	I mean, hell, it makes Duke Nukem Forever and its 15-year delay look like nothing.
4971505	4972325	Beyond Good and Evil 2.
4972665	4973546	We're not there yet.
4973686	4974746	I mean, working on it, right?
4975306	4979327	So anyway, a small group of friends made this game.
4979347	4983068	They did not have experience making games, but then they worked on this game.
4983088	4984568	There were breaks, crunching.
4985089	4996351	The game was finished and ready to be published, but the high cost of shipping the game on Game Boy cartridges and the fact that the game may not be successful meant the publisher did not want to publish the game.
4996912	4998012	So finally...
4998852	4999793	Thank you for watching!
5030056	5031858	Mike Def says, when should we release our game?
5031958	5032158	Hmm.
5032458	5034780	When this podcast OLR hits a thousand episodes.
5034920	5035901	That'll never happen, right?
5037423	5038864	Yes.
5039625	5043108	Weak, weak laughter ensues.
5043168	5046271	Bonds006 says, Half-Life 3 still going strong.
5046291	5047012	Yeah, there's that.
5047092	5047612	There's that.
5048706	5049027	All right.
5049127	5054616	Anyway, well, let's talk about a game that didn't happen in this segment that we do once a month.
5054676	5057902	It's not the classic game, but it's a different segment.
5057942	5060246	And we're going to roll the classic bumper anyway.
5060286	5060667	Here we go.
5071300	5095215	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week all right but as mentioned DarkSakura once a month in 2024 covers a cancelled game so DarkSakura what is tonight's cancelled game of the month the cancelled game of the month is Dinosaur Planet
5096391	5097112	Yay!
5097212	5099034	How many of y'all know of Dinosaur Planet?
5099074	5105239	Raise your hand, or at least type, my hand is raised in chat, if you're in our chat.
5106361	5113327	So, Dinosaur Planet is the game that eventually became Star Fox Adventures.
5114788	5118912	And, yeah, it was pretty far along, too.
5119984	5140306	but um it was in development uh between I'd say 1999 and 2000 and Rare had put out a lot of artwork and screenshots and trailers and some of the soundtrack um and you can they're still they're still out there um and Rinmari you are correct it was Star Fox Adventures anyway um
5142064	5169118	a lot of the plot and settings were retained for Star Fox Adventures so there were two main characters one named Saber and another Crystal and Saber was a was a Vox who was like the son well he was a royal knight and the son of a wizard named Randorn
5169938	5174181	Crystal is an adopted sister who is a feline character.
5175622	5179864	And they each have their little sidekick.
5179964	5182946	So you have Tricky for Saber and Kite for Crystal.
5183947	5194153	And you would use these characters to go through different locations in different parts of the game and switch between them using these things called Swapstones that later became Warpstones.
5195154	5205701	and then each of the characters had their own weapons and you would just basically go through the game to try to
5206932	5208593	Solve the story and get to the end.
5209974	5214216	There were also some other characters.
5214236	5215777	There was Randorn, who was the wizard.
5219239	5223142	He was going through some pretty bad grief.
5224583	5227885	He basically killed a bunch of people and saved Crystal.
5228525	5229085	Sorry, she's a fox.
5229125	5229246	Sorry.
5229286	5229786	I think...
5236158	5237359	Saber is supposed to be a wolf.
5238239	5238520	Anyway.
5239881	5246765	So anyway, Randorn was eventually cut from the game and he was replaced with Earthwalker.
5248446	5250548	Lots of different changes were going through the game.
5252200	5261522	and one of his likes in the character and the story was a drop of whiskey and one of his dislikes was hangovers.
5262122	5263282	So he had a problem.
5264723	5267143	There's Jennifer, why did I say Jennifer?
5267543	5280366	General Scales who is supposed to have been a boss in Dinosaur Planet and then they had to scrap him as a boss due to being rushed so he was never the intended final boss.
5281306	5288594	You know, so you had all these characters that were pretty close to fleshed out, I would say.
5289274	5292057	And so you have different locations.
5292598	5299745	There was like Thorntail Hollow, Snowhorn Waste, Ice Mountain, Dark Ice Mines, and Krazoa Palace.
5301427	5329687	all kinds of different locations there were early versions of all of these that were found in the December 2000 build just in different states of completion there was a Discovery Falls in Diamond Bay that were removed locations that were similar to like Cape Claw there was a Plains area and that connects to Desert Force Point where there was another spellstone to be used all kinds of stuff
5330948	5344520	So going into a little bit of its production, the lead engineer, Phil Tossel, said that it actually started development right after Diddy Kong Racing in 1997.
5345981	5350826	And they were working on both that and Gemini toward the end of Nintendo 64's life.
5352727	5363991	The game had changed a bunch, as I was just saying, through some of the characters, and it was eventually settled on to be an open-world adventure with two interwoven stories, hence the two characters.
5364692	5374755	They had a character named Timber, who was the tiger character from Diddy Kong Racing, and that it was planned to be RC Pro-Am 64.
5376896	5397744	and then they you know sort of working on Donkey Kong some stuff so they decided to change it into like a prehistoric world in gameplay similar to Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and then they'd split the characters into Saber and Crystal so Saber is a wolf, Crystal is a fox and then
5399534	5406599	Eventually, they put so much work into this, but it was intended to be Rare's last game on the Nintendo 64.
5407720	5410962	And it had so many goodies packed in.
5411022	5414865	It was going to use the Nintendo 64's expansion pack.
5415445	5421730	It was going to be a 512 megabit cartridge, which would have been the largest on the console.
5422793	5446584	but back in Kyoto Miyamoto-san had requested that Imamura Takaya to work on another Star Fox title that would leave the rail shooter genre in favor of an adventure game and so there was eventually
5448764	5454668	As Rare was pushing Dinosaur Planet more and more and even had like a huge E3 2000 demonstration.
5457865	5464131	They didn't realize that Nintendo was starting to look for Star Fox.
5465812	5476061	And so when they reviewed the content of Dinosaur Planet, that being Nintendo, they saw that Saber looked kind of like Fox McCloud.
5476141	5477602	It was just very striking.
5478563	5481886	And so Nintendo asked Rare to...
5482907	5490589	keep Dinosaur Planet quiet and had a meeting with them to marry Dinosaur Planet and Star Fox.
5491009	5496650	And so they agreed that Star Fox Adventures Dinosaur Planet would be an N64 game.
5497130	5509193	It would maintain much of the work that had already been put into Dinosaur Planet and then they were trying to work on how to bring Fox and other characters into the game and make it fit the Star Fox canon.
5510274	5510574	So
5512290	5541015	they were working on it for the Nintendo 64 and then saw that this could be something that might come out for GameCube as a launch game so they of course left Saber out, made Fox McCloud the lead it had a lot of the characters left over from Dinosaur Planet like Crystal and Tricky and then basically they redesigned her to make her well, more
5541912	5542354	Foxy.
5543337	5543758	Yeah.
5543959	5544500	Bad pun.
5544741	5545042	I know.
5546186	5546266	Um...
5547887	5574410	but her whole point in being there was to attract the male gaze what else am I going to say or maybe some lady gaze but that probably wasn't their intention so at any rate Dinosaur Planet was actually dropped from the name and this one was basically like a huge departure eventually from the original concept and
5575649	5586094	went through a bunch of different graphical upgrades for GameCube and then the game ended up being reworked to be a GameCube release and it went from there.
5589255	5589915	There you go.
5590296	5590596	Alright.
5591316	5592877	After that, Microsoft bought Rare.
5594781	5603714	Well, there it is, your classic cancelled game, but it evolved into something else, but certainly not in the same form that it was the first time.
5604716	5605437	Dinosaur Planet.
5606192	5618206	There was a little point that I wanted to say is that there was a development version for Dinosaur Planet for Nintendo 64, and I think that's the one that we're watching.
5619327	5625414	It was dated December 2000 that had been leaked online from a collector in Sweden.
5626355	5649510	and it has a unique model for Fox instead of Saber so that indicates that this transition was looking to happen well before it was going to the GameCube but yeah it's out there to play most of the game so I mean there's still a lot that's missing because it's still a developmental copy but it's out there it looks pretty fun to me
5650373	5655695	Alright, there's your cancelled game of the month.
5656075	5661157	Alright, we're gonna quickly just touch on a few more headlines and then we're gonna probably wrap it up here pretty soon.
5661217	5662738	Oh, we'll get some release dates real quick too.
5663418	5666119	Let's just touch on a few quick headlines and some rapid fire news.
5666179	5666440	Loki.
5667460	5672322	Oh boy, we had the announcement of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and...
5674073	5674654	DarkSakura
5693611	5699057	Um, so they are working on a Crazy Taxi reboot that will be an open world MMO.
5699277	5702420	It's got AAA power behind it, so they're really gonna push it.
5703081	5704902	Set in something like California.
5705723	5708085	Sounds like, uh, live service.
5708226	5712550	Yeah, remember how I was just saying not everything needs to be a live service game?
5714355	5720700	Anyway, buy the original Offspring soundtrack for just $5.99.
5720800	5723922	I should just play the game on my iPad.
5725203	5733690	If you want to check out games from a time when they weren't all live service game, Atari 50, the anniversary celebration, is getting an update.
5733990	5734911	It's not a free update.
5734971	5736652	It's an expanded edition of the game.
5736992	5738974	It will have two new timelines, and get this,
5739474	5741455	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5763331	5767032	which will chronicle the rivalry between the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision.
5767492	5777735	A selection of M network games will be available alongside interviews with former Intellivision game director Don Daglau and network programmers that were involved.
5777935	5780276	David Crane's actually going to be in this as well from Activision.
5780696	5782136	So this sounds like it's really cool.
5782656	5784037	And it's like, wow.
5784137	5787718	So Atari buying Intellivision because remember that was a thing like a month ago.
5787998	5791799	Something is already paying off with some of this potential collaboration we're seeing here.
5792299	5793020	What's Human on PC?

5831578	5832398	I have no idea.
5833819	5836860	It's a French name, and I butchered that.
5837540	5840041	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5841121	5844643	Then we've got Yaling Mythical Journey on PC.

5903374	5906335	This is a very old game, by the way, that goes all the way back to the PC 9801.
5908136	5911417	But it's been remastered, redrawn, has all this extra stuff with it.
5911437	5911958	So that's cute.
5912518	5915839	I think there's like Princess Maker MZ on Steam on sale right now.
5915919	5918080	Yeah, I think this series would go on for a very long time.
