1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Rogue.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I got it.

3
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe BBS downloads.

4
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:13,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm old.

5
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:15,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogue occupies a similar space as Doom.

6
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:21,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of things replicated it, iterated on it, improved it, and its name turned into less of the game, but its conventions and meanings.

7
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Doom, Rogue is back!

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,297
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, the Amiga port is.

9
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the Switch.

10
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:27,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I do miss the ASCII, though.

11
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,179
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Graveyard Intro.

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

13
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

14
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:46,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

15
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:48,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

16
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:52,761
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back once again tonight, July 21st of 2024 with the 1011th, 11th, 11th?

17
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,767
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000... It's almost a tongue twister.

18
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,309
[SPEAKER_02]: These numbers are getting so high, it's a tongue twister.

19
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:05,032
[SPEAKER_02]: The 1,011th episode of our show.

20
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:12,219
[SPEAKER_02]: When I can talk correctly, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined each and every week, you hear over there, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, how are you doing?

23
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:16,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Frustrated.

24
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:17,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:23,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having camera issues tonight, so we have the static picture of one of your VTubes until we get the real thing back.

26
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:31,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not know what's going on with my virtual cam, but I was trying to open it with Mac Family Tree.

27
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea what's going on here.

28
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:35,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to fix this business.

29
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:40,609
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and here I thought Macs and Windows 3.1 was immune from everything that happened on Friday.

30
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You and Southwest Airlines.

31
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:46,355
[SPEAKER_07]: This has nothing to do with what happened on Friday.

32
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:50,738
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a completely different thing where it's set to open with the wrong...

33
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,542
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

34
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:07,538
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:32,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I've just had a month between the leg injury I talked about on the show previously and then I got really sick.

36
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:46,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really, really bad sore throat and get this, it went from being a sore throat to pink eye, like really bad viral, not bacterial, so eye drops didn't do anything, pink eye.

37
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:50,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And then went from that to like all these other symptoms that just suck.

38
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:51,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The weird thing

39
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

40
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,511
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

41
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:35,715
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was feeling like 99% yesterday so really recovery couldn't come soon enough.

42
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:36,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it COVID?

43
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:37,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

44
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll never know.

45
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:45,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel like everything is COVID now especially when it's unexplainable symptoms that manifest in strange ways so...

46
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:47,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter.

47
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go anywhere.

48
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:49,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I was homebound for two days.

49
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:53,070
[SPEAKER_02]: My poor Pikmin were not getting walked in Pikmin Bloom.

50
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: My Pokemon were not getting caught.

51
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: GoFest?

52
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:56,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know her.

53
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do Pokemon GoFest this year at all.

54
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught two Pokemon from my bed.

55
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I did.

56
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was an adventure.

57
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:05,175
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for damn sure.

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:05,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

59
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:08,065
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

60
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,283
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

61
00:04:55,004 --> 00:05:00,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, it's really good that I did not have plane tickets to go to Atlanta when I was sick.

62
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything happens for a reason, I suppose.

63
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully I'll be able to go next year or something.

64
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:07,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to get back.

65
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:10,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, DragonCon's going to happen every year.

66
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:15,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to justify a second trip outside of that unless, like, your friend's getting married.

67
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an easy one to justify.

68
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:21,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, convention, you know, it just kind of depends on what's going on.

69
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe every other year for that.

70
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:23,411
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

71
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But hello to those of you in chat.

72
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:30,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I always appreciate seeing your shining faces over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we tape live.

73
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:31,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

74
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:36,358
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S gives me a please know when I bring up what happened on Friday.

75
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

76
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts and prayers, Ranma.

77
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts and prayers.

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil of Nine in chat says, protect yourself, Rob.

79
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:43,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We're elderly now.

80
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:43,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

81
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:45,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are.

82
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:46,944
[SPEAKER_02]: There sure is.

83
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, Rin Mari in chat says, TBH, I'm a little less hype for California Extreme because the usual providers for the rhythm games and shmups aren't going.

84
00:05:57,808 --> 00:06:00,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just have to enjoy pin and ball torture.

85
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of it called pin and ball torture, but I love that.

86
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But DarkSakura, you are planning on a trip to California Extreme next weekend, right?

87
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:10,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

88
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:11,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'll be fun.

89
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,171
[SPEAKER_07]: A Bathtub A Bathtub

90
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:55,383
[SPEAKER_07]: staying in a hotel with bathtub having the giant hotel bed the bathtub no the bathtub specifically because you know what my bathtub situation is like oh yeah yeah you're it's your cat yeah it's the cat the cat box lives in it yeah because it's the only room we have for it because a certain somebody will let me put a cat door on the laundry room door mm-hmm

91
00:06:56,861 --> 00:07:04,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, and, uh, Rin, if you're going to be there, I mean, you can hang out at our hotel room.

92
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw Orange Rites going too.

93
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:10,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, there's a, there's a VOG party in DarkSakura's bathtub.

94
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:11,209
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

95
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:11,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

96
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:16,512
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but other than that, I really hope there's, um, a Nilton John.

97
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was seeing that pinball.

98
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first time I saw that pinball table was in the video footage Bobby was sharing on his show tonight.

99
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That table looks fabulous.

100
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:26,715
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like a great table.

101
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:33,083
[SPEAKER_07]: But... Sorry, it's Dan that's being resistant.

102
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:34,785
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway...

103
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:57,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played it before, I played it at California Extreme Not California Extreme, oh my god And by the way, I'm sorry if I'm messing up words I had a 12 hour subathon yesterday And my brain is broken and I just took migraine meds So if I'm out of it, that is why I am medicated to the eyeballs Anyway

104
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:22,575
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah I want to see if they have the candy cabs there like Rin is saying because I want to play the shmups that I'm no good at plus there was a Sonic the Fighters there and I really had a lot of fun playing that and trashing whoever it was that was sitting on the opposite side of me that I couldn't see also

105
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few games in particular that I really hope to see.

106
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's all the ones that we see all the time anyway.

107
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:37,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would like to... I think I might try to remember to bring some plug-in headphones so I can actually hear playing Beatmania.

108
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

109
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I also... I need to get a new EMUs card, I think.

110
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Or find my EMUs card, I should rather say.

111
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:55,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... There's some other games that I would just like to see.

112
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more Neo Geo stuff.

113
00:08:57,734 --> 00:09:02,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been having the wild urge to play Polestar and Blazing Star.

114
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:09,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if I could find the cartridges for it, hell yeah, I'd be down.

115
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:28,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to play Last Blade if they have one like Last Blade 2 in an arcade because I haven't played one of those in a while and if there's a Radiant Silvergun sign me the fuck up because last time I played that in an arcade was a DDR Freak trip to Las Vegas when we stayed at the Bellagio Fancy

116
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,870
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wasn't invited, but yes, I heard about the trip.

117
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you weren't a moderator.

118
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't a moderator.

119
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was a flashy foot, but I wasn't a moderator.

120
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:39,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

121
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:44,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But just a few things I think would be fun to play.

122
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:47,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for the Windows startup noise.

123
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:53,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not know how to turn off the sound alerts for my personal feed when we're doing this, so I apologize for that.

124
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Windows, ugh.

125
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:55,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

126
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:57,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave you a Mac!

127
00:09:58,697 --> 00:09:59,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't.

128
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:00,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I enabled you to get a Mac.

129
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of dated at this point, but yes.

130
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean.

131
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:06,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

132
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:20,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was, you know, it was funny, all of, oh god, I can't say it without revealing anything, but a bunch of us in my group work on Macs.

133
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:26,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And none of us knew what was going on until someone had actually checked CNN.

134
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:32,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like, oh, we didn't notice anything.

135
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,299
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of funny.

136
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:59,051
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is that the price of Xbox Game Pass is going to be changing.

137
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:12,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because we knew that this was kind of rumored when we heard that Call of Duty, the big Activision title that Microsoft bought, Activision Blizzard,

138
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:13,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Game Pass

139
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:45,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to go up from $17 a month to $20 a month.

140
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to start, if you're new, that pricing already has taken effect.

141
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:53,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It started back in July, the day after the email, or back on July 10th, the day after the email.

142
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:59,060
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are not new or new, you're recurring, then that price is going to kick in in September.

143
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But where this gets really weird is that there's going to be all of these other changes.

144
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:06,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So

145
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:21,388
[SPEAKER_02]: If this Xbox Ultimate doesn't work for you, then you can go to Xbox Game Pass for console, which is cheaper, but it doesn't have PC games and it doesn't have EA Play games, and that will be just $15 a month.

146
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Console, Game Pass PC, Game Pass Standard

147
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Pass for Matching Service, Game Pass EX2, The Vampire Hunter

148
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:15,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Pass prepaid cards beyond 13 months.

149
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:22,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So those of you that would stack the deal for like three years, five years at a time, and I know a lot of you did that some time ago, you can't do that anymore.

150
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:24,064
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting rid of that.

151
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:28,005
[SPEAKER_02]: PC Game Pass, also getting price increase from $10 to $12.

152
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:34,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Pass Core, which is another thing, which was originally Xbox Live Gold, which comes with a

153
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:48,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still allows you to play the Xbox games online That goes up from $60 to $75 Messy, messy, messy, messy, messy And it doesn't make sense

154
00:13:49,565 --> 00:14:11,768
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I think this is a really silly plan for Xbox when they're trying to lean into more and more people being on the Game Pass platform and we're even hearing rumors and again they're rumors they should be taken with a grain of salt but that Microsoft plans to de-emphasize console sales in Europe in favor of Game Pass sales.

155
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:30,517
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a little weird to me because the one decent way to deliver Game Pass sales is via a console so if you are de-emphasizing the console then that tells me you're only interested in emphasizing PC Game Pass which quite frankly at this point I'm thinking I'm going to switch to

156
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:31,879
[SPEAKER_02]: within all this.

157
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:43,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right now a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, but I so rarely use my Xbox Series X, and with this price increase and everything, I'm kind of having to re-evaluate this, going, is this really worth it?

158
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:44,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, no.

159
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:48,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much only play stuff on PC Game Pass at this point.

160
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:49,312
[SPEAKER_02]: If that.

161
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still use No Man's Sky, and I do check out things on PC Game Pass once in a while.

162
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:57,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still think it'd be valuable for me to keep that, but...

163
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:01,721
[SPEAKER_02]: This is way too confusing, Microsoft.

164
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,324
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to be cleaned up.

165
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:09,292
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was bad enough that we have the Series S and the Series X and all this.

166
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to break it down for the audience.

167
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,878
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to do things like...

168
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:18,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you want to do like gold, silver, bronze or platinum, silver, gold, platinum.

169
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, people generally kind of understand that sort of thing.

170
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:30,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, you want to do different tiers or like with A, B, C tier, 1, 2, 3 tier, something like that.

171
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make a lot more sense.

172
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:39,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ultimate, Console, PC, Core, Standard, it's too much.

173
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:40,736
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't make sense.

174
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:44,633
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you don't use Game Pass at all, right?

175
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:45,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

176
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the hell, right?

177
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:48,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

178
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:57,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then there's the cloud thing too, but I think that's just kind of... Some of those Game Pass I mentioned, I couldn't tell you which ones also include the cloud gaming, which is a thing.

179
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's a big clusterfuck.

180
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a big clusterfuck.

181
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:10,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Clawstorm in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, Game Pass doesn't seem good for indie devs.

182
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:16,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft wants to cast a giant net over the budget consumer market by using their massive capital to offer $60 games for free.

183
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:24,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's gonna buy a $5 unproven game when 100 AAA titles are under the Monopoly subscription umbrella?

184
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:37,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Clawstorm, though, I've actually heard that Game Pass is actually pretty good for elevating a lot of indie games because if you, like, look at what's on the service now and look how many day one games they're really offering right now.

185
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:39,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't as many as you'd think.

186
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:40,575
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

187
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:17,142
[SPEAKER_02]: and there have been some interesting studies that have been done that show that even if somebody isn't buying a game on Game Pass per se, their friend will buy it because of word of mouth from that person who originally bought it.

188
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:22,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think for some indie devs, the ones that get in on Game Pass, it does actually work out pretty well.

189
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:26,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, a lot of those games only stay on the service for a year

190
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,245
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

191
00:17:52,136 --> 00:18:16,024
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do understand what you're saying about the whole like when you have a buffet of games available for free are you going to be tempted to buy five dollar games but I do think the marketplace has shown there has been room again for some success now you know because I could bring games like Stardew Valley or Vampire Survivors or Among Us that were very cheap very big games but

192
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:30,652
[SPEAKER_02]: but I also realized for every one of those games I named there are a thousand indie games that don't get discovered at all so I'm not going to say your point is without merit but I'm not sure that I would go so far as to say that Game Pass is necessarily bad for indie devs

193
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Clawstorm says, this is true as long as you agree to join the Microsoft side.

194
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:39,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Agree or disappear is how I see it as an indie dev myself.

195
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Great point though.

196
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

197
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:42,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

198
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Rinmari says, I kind of have a bone to pick with vampire survivors.

199
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:48,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit curious more about that.

200
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:53,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless that's a pun because like Bone, Castlevania, I'll forget it.

201
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:54,392
[SPEAKER_02]: SG100Matt says,

202
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:12,765
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point.

203
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:25,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, you know, especially when you consider the Costco discount, which I like to kind of put out there and, you know, I'm not a shill for Costco, but if I hear of another store doing something similar, I will happily promote it as well.

204
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go to Costco, you can get $100 worth of Xbox cards for $90.

205
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:36,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saving a little bit right there, and then you use that to buy the stacking, and there you go.

206
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:40,583
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of, you know, stretch the savings a little bit further.

207
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:42,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to think about.

208
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Renmari on Vampire Survivor says, It was the centerpiece of Steam's Shmup Fest, which showcased a lot of games that were not conventional shmups, while games that were genuinely shmups got rejected for not apparently representing the genre, such as Terra Flame.

209
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

210
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not aware of the whole Steam thing.

211
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,391
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that stuff going on there.

212
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,586
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

213
00:20:54,405 --> 00:21:00,367
[SPEAKER_02]: when said big company is led by Bobby Kotick, one of the most toxic individuals in the entire gaming industry.

214
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Growl.

215
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:02,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bark, bark, bark.

216
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:03,987
[SPEAKER_02]: This needed to happen.

217
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:08,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of am like, FTC, investigate Bobby Kotick or back off.

218
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's where you need to be looking.

219
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of let this go.

220
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But now the FTC is back and I'm a little bit like, okay, I'm kind of curious where this leads.

221
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:21,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So

222
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:26,797
[SPEAKER_02]: The FTC has come out and said they wrote in a letter to the U.S.

223
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: appeals court and said this is, quote, exactly the sort of consumer harm that they were worried about with the Activision acquisition.

224
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to the U.S.

225
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:37,991
[SPEAKER_02]: appeals court.

226
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:41,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And now this letter is talking about the price hike.

227
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:46,079
[SPEAKER_02]: and points out about the $3 price increase and so forth.

228
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,441
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole letter that's out there if you want to read.

229
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.

230
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:53,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of short.

231
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: For a legal document, it's pretty short.

232
00:21:55,066 --> 00:22:08,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only two pages, but they say as part of this, Microsoft's price increases and product degradation combined with Microsoft's reduced investments and output and product quality via employee layoffs.

233
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:13,590
[SPEAKER_02]: are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.

234
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

235
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:57,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft's post merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminary halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm's economic incentives.

236
00:22:58,081 --> 00:23:13,109
[SPEAKER_02]: This could get very interesting because when you look at that letter and that phrasing and the fact they bring in the receipts, they're saying Microsoft testified, COD available, no price increase.

237
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Those receipts are there.

238
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, what the fuck can they realistically do at this point?

239
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:23,955
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been laid off and found new jobs.

240
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:30,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you want to get technical, can the government come in and split up a company?

241
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:31,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they can.

242
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Could the government come in and split up Microsoft by force?

243
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:38,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they could.

244
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:39,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be pretty?

245
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,168
[SPEAKER_07]: If they can prove there's a hard monopoly.

246
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:42,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

247
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:45,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

248
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:50,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your popcorn.

249
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:51,188
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be good.

250
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:52,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

251
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:59,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to do the predicting and forecasting a lot on here, but when it comes to the government, I can't fucking predict shit.

252
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially on today, July 21st, 2024.

253
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:11,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done trying to predict what the fuck's going on in this country anymore.

254
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

255
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:16,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need to sit back.

256
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:22,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to just let them do their thing and let me know when to come back and take a look.

257
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where I'm at.

258
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,414
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm at.

259
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so that's kind of the new thing that happened this week is the FTC getting on board.

260
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:32,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not over.

261
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:34,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This is far from being over.

262
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens next.

263
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it was Call of Duty or through Xbox Game Pass or not.

264
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:46,998
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

265
00:24:48,175 --> 00:25:12,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I had experiences this week not just having to do with my subathon which I will get to that in a second because I know you want to know about the fork and the knife not necessarily a plate the bowl and the spoon just saying or the sippy cup that's right I want to know about Ariana Grande's adventures in Fortnite well that outfit I showed you I actually bought today because it's the one I wish I could have bought yesterday so you played Fortnite again today

266
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:17,645
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just loaded it up long enough to get the outfit and then lug out.

267
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,186
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did play for... Okay, I'll just get to it.

268
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:20,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.

269
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:21,086
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

270
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:24,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of fucking Dead by Daylight yesterday.

271
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:27,528
[SPEAKER_02]: If we've learned anything today, folks, bullying works.

272
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:29,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

273
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I never bully people.

274
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:31,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking.

275
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm saying that very tongue, very firmly planted in cheek.

276
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Played four games of Fortnite.

277
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:37,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

278
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:43,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I played with Ryan, who is Shayla's boyfriend.

279
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:47,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played with my friend Smokey, another one of my DVD buddies.

280
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:50,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did four matches.

281
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:51,454
[SPEAKER_07]: We won three of them.

282
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I have learned that I love sniping.

283
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to be up in high places and look down upon my enemies as I rain death.

284
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:06,445
[SPEAKER_07]: We also had a bus.

285
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:06,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Tracks.

286
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:17,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I said tracks we also managed to get a murder bus which we killed all the NPCs to acquire and I was blowing up buildings and that was pretty funny

287
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:23,859
[SPEAKER_07]: and blowing up people at point-blank range with a grenade launcher.

288
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That was also really fun.

289
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,742
[SPEAKER_07]: It brought out the worst in me and I was very happy to have that outlet.

290
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot of fun.

291
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,543
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot more fun than I thought it would be.

292
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:40,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really start off motion sick.

293
00:26:40,504 --> 00:26:43,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a little headachy after a few games.

294
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's the meds.

295
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:59,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, yeah, it was, uh, it was, uh, pretty, pretty fun, I'll admit, and it was a redeem from Last Subathon.

296
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:21,313
[SPEAKER_07]: so I got it out of my system and who knows I might play it again but not unless I have other people to play with I bought the Kitane character the first time I made my account and everything and then when I went in yesterday there was this Ariana Grande skin that had this fucking dragon armor and I'm like, bitch

297
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:47,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I am hot as fuck in this fucking dragon armor for fuck's sake so I have the dragon armor and then I bought the other outfit I guess it was her first one but it has these crystals and shit on it in the dark mode or something and I'm like, I like this too so I have that and it's really funny to watch her with a guitar rocking out to Master of Puppets

298
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,153
[SPEAKER_07]: because I did buy the Master of Puppets emote.

299
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:55,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was hilarious.

300
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:58,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was funny is that all three of us had it.

301
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were like a three-person band because it's one of those four-people emotes.

302
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:07,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of us were doing the Master of Puppets thing.

303
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:10,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We had our guitar, our bass, and a drummer.

304
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:11,629
[SPEAKER_07]: We just didn't have our lead.

305
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really love to do a Clueless Fortnite stream with you, because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in that game.

306
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:21,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing either.

307
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:22,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, Clueless Fortnite.

308
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:31,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Fortnite Festival, that I can do, and Fortnite Lego, but Battle Royale, I'd love to play just for the lols, to be honest.

309
00:28:31,837 --> 00:29:00,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try the Lego mode and there's also there's like a fuck ton of modes like there's like RP modes and exploration modes and escape rooms and all kinds of shit they go they go to fucking town man town and uh but I did actually get like three songs for uh for festival yeah so uh do you want to guess what they are

310
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen the song update list in a long time, so I would really have to guess.

311
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got my Happy Driving song.

312
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Are any of them Gaga songs?

313
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

314
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, then you picked correctly.

315
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:13,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

316
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:15,364
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to guess which one?

317
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:17,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my favorite Gaga song.

318
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not Shiza.

319
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:21,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So Happy I Could Die?

320
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,892
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Rain On Me.

321
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:25,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that is a good song.

322
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have Rain On Me, I have Into You, because that was the only Ariana Grande song on there that I thought was really, that I really liked the best.

323
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:34,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song too.

324
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:41,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, although I would like No Tears Left To Cry, because that actually is my favorite Ariana Grande song.

325
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:42,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I take that back.

326
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:43,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus is my favorite.

327
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:45,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the new one that sounds like a Robin song.

328
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:47,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds just like a Robin song.

329
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to check it out.

330
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:51,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even remember the name of the song.

331
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:51,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

332
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:55,483
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm old and I don't know new music anymore.

333
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:56,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it!

334
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:00,107
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not allowed to say that because then that means I'm older.

335
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:09,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I have BTS Dynamite because that's like the one BTS song I like and it makes me happy.

336
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:10,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

337
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:10,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Garth.

338
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:11,816
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't be friends.

339
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:12,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.

340
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:14,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

341
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to know that Garth the Wolf will be bringing me meals when I'm too old.

342
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:21,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, stop!

343
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:22,690
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

344
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We Can't Be Friends is the song I was trying to think of.

345
00:30:24,593 --> 00:30:26,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, stop it.

346
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:38,543
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Brad, you just don't don't don't do not don't dot com slash org for matching service.

347
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for your game?

348
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and this is a big something.

349
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:48,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I cannot say what it was I played.

350
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,947
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a closed beta.

351
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:52,707
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I can say.

352
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:54,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I might tell you privately.

353
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:56,228
[SPEAKER_07]: However,

354
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:25,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to try a tool that incorporates game porting kit for Mac without me having to jump through all the hoops of the developer console and blah blah I mean I've got the developer access and all that I can do all of that but I got an app called Whiskey and I was able to load up my beta software just fine

355
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:28,938
[SPEAKER_07]: ran with no fucking problems at all.

356
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:37,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's W-H-I-S-K-Y and podculture, if you're spelling it that way, you need an H in there.

357
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:39,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

358
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:41,682
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a great tool.

359
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:48,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it uses sort of like a wine environment and aspects of the game porting kit.

360
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:54,361
[SPEAKER_07]: to basically convert all the DirectX stuff to metal.

361
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And it runs the game like it was a fucking native app.

362
00:31:58,664 --> 00:31:59,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so smooth.

363
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:02,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I had zero problems.

364
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

365
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:05,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious what it was now.

366
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:08,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tested it on non-beta stuff.

367
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I played What the Fog.

368
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:13,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It was perfect.

369
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:16,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I also...

370
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:22,708
[SPEAKER_07]: have run the app that I use to rip the Dead by Daylight files.

371
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:26,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And it runs.

372
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,952
[SPEAKER_07]: My YouFinder app, it runs.

373
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:31,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

374
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:47,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to see now if I can use it to get my Dead by Daylight files again so I can go back to my character creation because I'm also in the middle of learning how to take the clothes out of

375
00:32:50,259 --> 00:33:00,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Blender, like to separate them from the models and then incorporate them into Daz3D so I can make like outfits for Machinima and whatever things that I want to do.

376
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:05,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually really opened a creative door for me that had been closed since I decided to stop paying for Parallels.

377
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it'll, it'll

378
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:19,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to try some other apps, like see if I can find some PC-only stuff and give it a go.

379
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they do have to be 64-bit.

380
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:45,929
[SPEAKER_07]: but I might try it on some other games like I'm trying to think I have a bunch of PC games that if they're not on GeForce Experience I can't play them and this is kind of opened me back up this means that Mac gaming is alive and well and can thrive you don't need to have those other resources although I still like my um

381
00:33:47,049 --> 00:34:01,666
[SPEAKER_07]: my GeForce experience but I'm going to try to see if I can run Dead by Daylight on it and if I can or Fortnite or something else the advantage to GeForce experience means that I don't have to locally install my games

382
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:24,294
[SPEAKER_02]: um really quickly before we get to my gaming week um talking about like cloud gaming and dead by daylight and all that stuff i couldn't help but think of you when they announced that finally finally in dead by daylight cross progression is coming and i think it's tomorrow um which means that when i was on stadia all the purchase yeah all the purchases you made on stadia can finally come up except you probably bought most of it again already well they refunded me

383
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

384
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.

385
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to rebuy them anyway.

386
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:32,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Although what was funny is that here I am getting like all these oodles.

387
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think some of it was like some of the games, the full games I paid for.

388
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:37,823
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got all this money back.

389
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:46,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I only ended up paying like at the time like $175 for my missing DLC.

390
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:50,572
[SPEAKER_07]: But I kept... The thing is that they didn't...

391
00:34:52,828 --> 00:35:18,184
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't make me rebuy my cosmetics it was just the DLC interesting yeah the thing that I wish would happen now if it happens to load up all of my achievements fuck yes I'm very curious about that too the first thing I'm going to do is launch it on Playstation and see what happens if my Steam achievements come over I'll be very interested in that

392
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:31,862
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem, though, is that, and this is what was explained to me, is that achievements are like for service-based, I guess, since they're all wrapped into that specific service.

393
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:40,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and on top of that, I mean, I don't know if Google still has any of their Stadia servers active for stuff like that.

394
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:41,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

395
00:35:41,388 --> 00:36:08,250
[SPEAKER_07]: so that may be a factor as well I've been busting my ass trying to regain some of them although I need to get back on my hardcore killer playing to get most of the ones that I have I've gotten a bunch more than I had before and I'm actually pretty happy that because I had used free GeForce experience once for when I was linking my Steam version

396
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Way back before I had to move to Steam full-time.

397
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So I linked that and my P350s did sync over.

398
00:36:17,456 --> 00:36:18,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

399
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:24,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So I at least have my P350 showing on there, which is, I think, the only legacy achievement that is on there.

400
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:31,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see what happens with that cross-progression tomorrow because that's a pretty big deal for that game.

401
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:38,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I originally played it, ironically, on Game Pass and so I actually had some DLC that was only on Xbox.

402
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up re-buying it on Steam but I guess I get a certain amount of shards for having the same thing twice.

403
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:45,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see.

404
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:51,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be also interesting just to have all my stuff on PlayStation because I actually like playing the game on PlayStation.

405
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:54,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs very smooth and the controller is very nice so we'll see.

406
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:54,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

407
00:36:55,066 --> 00:37:14,049
[SPEAKER_02]: well I messaged you what it was I played but don't say anything okay of course um let's see my gaming week so um a lot of Final Fantasy 14 of course what else is new because Dawn Trail is still relatively new I did beat Dawn Trail uh recently I think before I guess I talk about it on the show yet because it might have happened the week we didn't end up doing a show but I did beat Dawn Trail

408
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:16,010
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

409
00:37:35,168 --> 00:38:01,314
[SPEAKER_02]: is rough I think story-wise the first half of the expansion is rough but once you get into the second half it is incredible especially once again they really knocked it out of the park with the last zone and I think at the end of the day the battle content like the dungeons and all that are very very it's literally the best it's ever been as when you get to the dungeons and the actual battle content which is the stuff you're actually replaying so I'll get I'm gonna give it to them on that

410
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:05,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so otherwise it hasn't left me time for a lot of new games.

411
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:12,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I've still been doing a little bit of Diablo 4 because I still do want to finish this season, but I did play one brand new game, brand, brand new game.

412
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:20,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I've talked about a new Switch game, but that Nintendo World Championship NES edition came out on Friday.

413
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:21,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

414
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:25,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been, uh, you're talking about Dan, uh, playing that and I've been playing that as well.

415
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:30,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot it came out until I saw Bobby Blackwolf streaming it on Friday.

416
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:30,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh,

417
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:32,637
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

418
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

419
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:52,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically NES Remix.

420
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:53,744
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

421
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:55,145
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't remix anything.

422
00:38:55,566 --> 00:39:01,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's playing the games in short bursts and kind of focusing on the speedrun element.

423
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:14,462
[SPEAKER_02]: My only concern is that if they don't refresh these challenges or add to the challenges or do some of these things a little more often, I'm afraid the game is going to wear out its welcome pretty quick.

424
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,024
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

425
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Over maybe 10 classic NES games each.

426
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,178
[SPEAKER_02]: A really rough estimate.

427
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:56,780
[SPEAKER_02]: That is like, okay, in some games it's... So like for Mario 1, grab the mushroom as fast as you can.

428
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is like a 4 second challenge.

429
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:03,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it might be beat World 1-1 as fast as you can.

430
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:04,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a little bit meatier of a challenge.

431
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:08,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's actually only about a 30 second challenge.

432
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my time was actually down to like 26 seconds.

433
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:13,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Because beating World 1-1, speedrunning it...

434
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:18,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You really just... You don't fuck around with mushrooms, coins, or anything.

435
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:19,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You go start to finish.

436
00:40:20,508 --> 00:40:34,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do like that they're kind of putting that speedrun element on it, especially when Awesome Games Done Quick and Summer Games Done Quick and those speedrunning sorts of events have such large fanbases and fans that it's been getting speedrunning more popular.

437
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:36,837
[SPEAKER_02]: This does feel like it's kind of like a...

438
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:41,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you learn how to speedrun certain elements of games?

439
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:52,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these challenges start small, but spoiler alert, because I got so many coins from playing some of the... I had to play that gold level challenge over and over and over until I beat it.

440
00:40:53,267 --> 00:41:00,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they do this knockout challenge where it's like, you know, you have eight players, and then you get four players, then you have two players, then you have one.

441
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:03,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the gold level, it's actually kind of difficult.

442
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:05,135
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me several tries to beat it.

443
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:07,197
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had so many coins from that,

444
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:24,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I unlocked every challenge in Mario Brothers Super Mario Brothers just to see what is the last challenge is the last challenge speedrun the entire fucking game and guess what spoiler alert yes it is the very last challenge is speedrun the entire fucking game

445
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:51,806
[SPEAKER_02]: so I wonder and what's interesting is that they actually do like a little help screen that actually you can it it shows you here are some tricks here are where the warp zones are I think everybody knows this by now but maybe maybe not maybe you're one of these gamers that wasn't born yet during the original NES championships as the opening credits of the game it kind of acknowledged that many many Nintendo fans weren't born yet when the first world championships happened

446
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:53,607
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

447
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:18,216
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:38,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was very interesting.

449
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:41,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do hope they keep adding to it.

450
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:46,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope there's a Super Nintendo version at some point, even though that wasn't really part of the original World Championships.

451
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:47,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

452
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:51,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This game has fuck all to do with the original championships.

453
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:56,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably because the Tetris rights are kind of in a weird place.

454
00:42:56,335 --> 00:43:00,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure Nintendo could put out the original NES Tetris again.

455
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:00,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

456
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,601
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the Game Boy version, didn't they?

457
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:05,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they could.

458
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how the rights issues work out.

459
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:11,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then Rad Racer was a Square Enix game, so they would need to have Square Enix on board.

460
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:16,287
[SPEAKER_02]: But shit, if they could get them on board, it would be fun to do the original cartridge run, if they could do it.

461
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:17,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

462
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:17,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

463
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:19,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting.

464
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:20,949
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that was the other big game I played this week.

465
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:23,910
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you said you've been kind of watching Dan play a little bit.

466
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts from watching Dan?

467
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:27,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really my jam.

468
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:29,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like...

469
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:30,551
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

470
00:43:51,354 --> 00:43:51,834
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.

471
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:54,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll watch people play it and I'm glad they're enjoying it.

472
00:43:54,777 --> 00:43:57,199
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not my cup of tea.

473
00:43:57,659 --> 00:43:58,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Not mine.

474
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:58,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fair.

475
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every video game has to be.

476
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:07,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I enjoy it and I like that it's not live with other players because it takes a lot of the pressure off, I think.

477
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:08,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only using ghost recordings.

478
00:44:09,008 --> 00:44:12,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird to think, are my ghost recordings showing up in other people's games?

479
00:44:12,631 --> 00:44:14,573
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the weird thing for me to think about.

480
00:44:15,393 --> 00:44:18,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I do, I now have a new dream game.

481
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:18,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

482
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it to be called Slow Running.

483
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:39,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the whole point of it is to get as distracted as humanly possible and find Easter eggs everywhere and break boundaries and find stuff that's behind the thing and just call it rabbit hole.

484
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

485
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Call it rabbit hole.

486
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just Thursday night gaming at my house.

487
00:44:43,623 --> 00:44:46,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, like the shit I used to do in World of Warcraft.

488
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:47,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I get it, I get it.

489
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:51,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Garth the Wolf in chat says, ghost recording like Mario Kart ghosts?

490
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:52,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of, yeah, same concept.

491
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:56,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're constantly going against ghosts in the World Championship game.

492
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:57,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Either it's your own ghost...

493
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, when you're kind of grinding the regular base challenges, that's what it is.

494
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's other players' ghosts.

495
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:08,163
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing like the gold championships and stuff, you're not racing against people live.

496
00:45:08,443 --> 00:45:10,083
[SPEAKER_02]: You're racing against their ghost recordings.

497
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:13,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do pull it off pretty well with that considered.

498
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:14,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting.

499
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:15,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

500
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:17,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's only 20 bucks.

501
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:20,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for that price, I'm like, all right, that's a fine price.

502
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:23,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand there was a physical edition that was much more money than that.

503
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:31,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just really depends on as far as I'm concerned, that is your affection for those types of physical products and keepsakes.

504
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is for you, then that's going to be the value there.

505
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I have to work on collecting less of that kind of stuff and not more.

506
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bypassed the physical version and just got the digital.

507
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:43,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

508
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:53,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Garth the Wolf in chat says, Nintendo, while they fail at online implementation most of the time, I appreciate the cute ways they do it sometimes.

509
00:45:53,324 --> 00:45:54,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to sum it up.

510
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It is cute.

511
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:56,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the cute way they did it here too.

512
00:45:58,109 --> 00:45:58,369
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

513
00:45:59,504 --> 00:46:05,606
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our Gaming Weeks, so let's get into some other gaming news and talk about what few headlines there are this week.

514
00:46:06,106 --> 00:46:11,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, lucky me, one of our first headlines tonight has to do with a game I play a lot.

515
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this game.

516
00:46:13,048 --> 00:46:14,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been going for eight years now.

517
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:16,549
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the game No Man's Sky.

518
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:22,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And No Man's Sky has just updated with their Worlds Part 1 update.

519
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:28,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the Worlds Part 1 update, which I love that it's Part 1, which indicates there's going to be another...

520
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

521
00:46:53,132 --> 00:47:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: looks phenomenal now it actually looks like water should kind of look like instead of like just like a flat thing it's this almost looks like avatar it's oh it's so good DarkSakura I love this game so much and it's only aged like a real fine wine over the last two years what's that that reminded me of the other thing I played but that was just the new avatar DLC which is gorgeous fair enough so fair enough anyway

522
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:17,723
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

523
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a brand new expedition that's very bug-inspired.

524
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:38,146
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Starship Troopers kind of tongue-in-cheek sort of thing.

525
00:47:38,586 --> 00:47:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually could kind of give or take the expedition at this point.

526
00:47:41,247 --> 00:47:45,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be a big fan, but the rewards have kind of dried up a little bit in those expeditions to me.

527
00:47:46,068 --> 00:47:48,049
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually see a little bit of that in this video right now.

528
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:53,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Pew, pew, pew against this giant bug, which this does not look like the same game that came out eight years ago.

529
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:57,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just wild that they continue to update this game and not charge for it.

530
00:47:57,272 --> 00:47:58,452
[SPEAKER_02]: But the weather looks great.

531
00:47:58,852 --> 00:48:01,573
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a lot that looks really good in this game.

532
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:07,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a dusty old copy of No Man's Sky sitting in there somewhere, you really should check out what they've changed in this game over the years.

533
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:08,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty incredible.

534
00:48:08,615 --> 00:48:14,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people out there that are like, honestly, Sean Murray, Hello Games, let us give you money.

535
00:48:15,357 --> 00:48:24,004
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't charge for this because I think to some extent they still feel this need to make up for the promises that happened eight years ago.

536
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:31,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most gamers have forgiven Sean Murray and we see I think the most important thing

537
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,111
[SPEAKER_02]: is changed behavior, right?

538
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:38,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it's one thing to say sorry, but it's another to show changed behavior.

539
00:48:39,035 --> 00:48:40,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at what's happening with Light No Fire.

540
00:48:41,337 --> 00:48:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: They have had that initial trailer and they haven't said shit about it since.

541
00:48:46,161 --> 00:48:50,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has changed behavior to me, especially if you look at what happened for No Man's Sky.

542
00:48:50,744 --> 00:49:00,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we still got a long ways to go until that game is out, but I have this funny feeling at some point they're just going to be like, Light No Fire comes out next week.

543
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:00,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

544
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:04,084
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm really excited for it.

545
00:49:04,104 --> 00:49:08,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see some of you in chat are actually going like, yeah, I'm hyped for No Man's Fire.

546
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Clawstorm says, excited for Hello Games new title.

547
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:19,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Garth Wolf says, man, I wish it was more of a game for me because I bounced off it, but visually it looks incredible.

548
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure it's always willing to welcome you back if you want.

549
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fifth Dream says, most of the improvements came last

550
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,174
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

551
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't disagree.

552
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:58,723
[SPEAKER_02]: However, here's that reverse problem.

553
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:14,073
[SPEAKER_02]: With No Man's Sky, we had the developers and Sony hyping up this game a little too much and talking about some things that were there in their minds, like conceptually they were there, but physically they were not there.

554
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know that No Man's Sky launched that way.

555
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:18,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little messy.

556
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:22,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hate the game when it first came out, but I didn't buy into the hype.

557
00:50:22,879 --> 00:50:24,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Very dangerous thing to do, right?

558
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,361
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love the game now.

559
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:31,564
[SPEAKER_02]: They've obviously, you know, it's not fair to look at No Man's Sky under the lens of like eight years ago.

560
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:33,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very, very different thing now.

561
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:38,929
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean by the opposite problem and with that comment that Clawstorm said is that we need to be careful.

562
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:45,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So the change behavior is that Sean Murray is now shutting the fuck up and not hyping this game beyond his control.

563
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:48,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be careful to not do that.

564
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:52,478
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to not hype this game up beyond control.

565
00:50:52,978 --> 00:50:53,919
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to

566
00:50:56,213 --> 00:51:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to give our golf applause at the trailer and go, yes, that is a lovely trailer for Light No Fire.

567
00:51:01,655 --> 00:51:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, very well splendid indeed.

568
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:05,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see what you all come up with.

569
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:14,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we all need to do them a big favor and shut the fuck up until the game comes out and just allow the experience to be what it is.

570
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:17,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that very tongue-in-cheek.

571
00:51:17,102 --> 00:51:25,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you're allowed to talk about it and so forth, but I'm just saying we just need to be careful about the hype machine, not to fill in for what Sean Murray is not doing this time.

572
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I love the way QuestBuster phrases this.

573
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:34,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It was as wide as an ocean, but as shallow as a puddle on lunch.

574
00:51:35,297 --> 00:51:36,018
[SPEAKER_02]: On lunch.

575
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:36,939
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

576
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:42,439
[SPEAKER_02]: A bitch is hungry, okay?

577
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It was as wide... Let's start again.

578
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:52,347
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster says, It was as wide as an ocean, but as shallow as a puddle on launch.

579
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:59,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hate them for it, but disappointed there wasn't more, especially after getting to the center of the galaxy and getting New Game+.

580
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:00,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

581
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:03,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, eight years, a lot has fucking changed.

582
00:52:03,676 --> 00:52:05,798
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't visited No Man's Sky in a long time...

583
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:07,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking do it.

584
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:08,994
[SPEAKER_02]: You really owe it to yourself to do it.

585
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:10,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Game Pass, by the way.

586
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:17,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's on just about every configuration of Game Pass there is, save the maybe the basic core one.

587
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:20,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're a Game Pass person, it's there.

588
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:22,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's on PlayStation Plus as well.

589
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:22,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

590
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:24,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't quote me on that.

591
00:52:24,178 --> 00:52:26,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's going to be a lot of ways to check that out.

592
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:30,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's on sale all the time for 20 bucks on one of the storefronts.

593
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep an eye out.

594
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,521
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not 20 bucks yet, it will be.

595
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:33,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait for the next sale.

596
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

597
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:39,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about, this is exciting news as well, right, DarkSakura?

598
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:43,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

599
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:48,199
[SPEAKER_02]: What's more exciting, this news or the cookie that you're currently eating?

600
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:50,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not eating a cookie, I'm eating a burger.

601
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, even better.

602
00:52:53,328 --> 00:52:54,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I need meat.

603
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:57,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were just going to talk a whole bunch more.

604
00:52:57,671 --> 00:52:58,792
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've said enough.

605
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:00,293
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say this.

606
00:53:00,353 --> 00:53:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Clawstorm in chat says on sale right now on Steam for $24.

607
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:04,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

608
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:06,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty good price.

609
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:09,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had the game for like ever and I haven't even...

610
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:11,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good.

611
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:39,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange on Studio.

612
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story.

613
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:42,106
[SPEAKER_07]: There's good news.

614
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:50,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Bethesda, their workers have come together.

615
00:53:51,009 --> 00:54:07,214
[SPEAKER_07]: 241 developers, artists, engineers, programmers, designers and they have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal and Microsoft recognized it.

616
00:54:08,684 --> 00:54:32,851
[SPEAKER_07]: so they are they're unioned they've come together for collective bargaining and I think that that's wonderful there's not a whole bunch more about it um but this is good news we're seeing they're they're joining the communication workers of America yay we need more we need more

617
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:56,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's uh you know especially that we're hearing now more of these bigger studios are trying to like Bethesda that's a pretty big deal um so I think we're really just going to see more and more of this uh this is this is a train that is not going to be able to be stopped in the industry uh and I think a lot of you know and Microsoft kind of is accepted this uh I think at this point so I'm glad it sort of enables Bethesda to be able to do this this is good so.

618
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:03,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Clawstorm in chat says Vault 124 is going to be filled with Bethesda employees that unionized.

619
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:05,466
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

620
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:18,733
[SPEAKER_07]: But they... But I mean, if you think about like there's ZeniMax and TenderClaws and Sega and Blizzard and all kinds.

621
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:24,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really happy to see that people are pushing this forward and I'm hoping to see...

622
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: See it widespread, not just in video games, but in tech in general.

623
00:55:31,424 --> 00:55:33,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, good thing, good thing.

624
00:55:34,335 --> 00:55:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

625
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:48,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of other Microsoft studios, and you mentioned Blizzard in there, some big news on another game that I follow quite a bit, which is Diablo 4, a game that has really just been also been aging pretty well in its short span.

626
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:54,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think a lot of us are still kind of like, does it need an expansion just one year after the release of the original game?

627
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:56,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of interesting things coming.

628
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:59,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I mean, is it a question if I'm going to buy it?

629
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:00,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm going to buy it.

630
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm the problem.

631
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:01,986
[SPEAKER_02]: But

632
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:05,487
[SPEAKER_02]: This new class that they're adding into the game does look pretty cool.

633
00:56:05,547 --> 00:56:07,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Spiritborn.

634
00:56:07,527 --> 00:56:13,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are saying it's a little bit of Diablo 3's Monk meets Diablo 3's Witch Doctor, which sounds like fun to me.

635
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: The Spiritborn was unveiled this week.

636
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:21,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I should clarify, we knew the Spiritborn was coming from the original launch trailer.

637
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,691
[SPEAKER_02]: We just know what it is and how it plays now.

638
00:56:25,171 --> 00:56:46,108
[SPEAKER_02]: and so the detail we got is that it is a dexterity driven class and it uses spirit guardians four of them and you can use those powers in combat there's a jaguar with fire damage there's an eagle with lightning damage the gorilla gives defensive power survivability and a centipede gives you poison and fear skills for like crowd control to make things run away and stuff like that

639
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:54,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Class Designer Bjorn Mikkelsen said in a livestream that happened this last week that Spiritborn is the fastest and most aggressive class.

640
00:56:55,434 --> 00:57:00,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just do a lot of burst damage with pole arms, quarterstaffs, and all this good stuff.

641
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:03,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it sounds like it's a pretty interesting class.

642
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:09,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know that Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion will be launching on October 8th.

643
00:57:09,422 --> 00:57:13,825
[SPEAKER_02]: The regular edition will be $40, but if you want to spend more money on it...

644
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:15,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You certainly can.

645
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:17,907
[SPEAKER_02]: They're happy to take your money.

646
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's like a $100 edition out there and much more.

647
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:23,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out if that's of interest to you.

648
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:27,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but yeah, the Spiritborn coming to Diablo 4 in October.

649
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:31,029
[SPEAKER_02]: October's really not that far away if you think about it, right?

650
00:57:31,069 --> 00:57:32,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're at the end of July.

651
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:33,229
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already spooky season.

652
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,010
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

653
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:34,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

654
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the 4th of July is over, spooky season begins.

655
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:37,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

656
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:37,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

657
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my pumpkin spice latte?

658
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:40,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Any day now.

659
00:57:42,831 --> 00:57:56,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Pumpkin Spice is so passe I bet Duncan rolls out Pumpkin Spice in about two weeks They are almost always like early August now with the Pumpkin Spice Boring Starbies will be the week before DragonCon

660
00:57:57,364 --> 00:58:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: that's usually when Starbees rolls it out because usually I enjoy for the last like five years I have enjoyed my first pumpkin spice latte at Dragon Con at the Starbees at Dragon Con there used to be a Starbees at America Mart right there but they closed that one after or at least in the last year it disappeared it wasn't there last year or so but I think I think one of the hotels has a Starbees because I still remember getting my pumpkin spice latte for the first time at Dragon Con last year so you know what I want hmm

661
00:58:26,642 --> 00:58:50,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a pumpkin latte not spice because it's not pumpkin it's just the spices in it I want pumpkin cream like they had at Disneyland I could dip my churros in actual legit pumpkin cream and it tasted like pumpkin and not pumpkin spice

662
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: All this sugar I'm not supposed to have.

663
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:55,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Pumpkin's actually really good for you.

664
00:58:55,936 --> 00:58:56,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

665
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:58,597
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just eat pumpkin as it is.

666
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:00,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I love roasted pumpkin.

667
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:01,679
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, that's a different story.

668
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:02,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a different story.

669
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of a different story, DarkSakura, EVO was happening this weekend.

670
00:59:06,381 --> 00:59:08,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I forgot about EVO.

671
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:10,923
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a little fighting game news, though.

672
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:11,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is exciting.

673
00:59:12,104 --> 00:59:13,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking you might, too.

674
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:13,605
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.

675
00:59:14,025 --> 00:59:14,805
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of things.

676
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:19,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But the big one is SNK versus Capcom SVC Chaos.

677
00:59:19,627 --> 00:59:19,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

678
00:59:21,008 --> 00:59:24,849
[SPEAKER_07]: is being re-released for PS4, for Switch, and Steam.

679
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:28,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like you can get it right now.

680
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:40,735
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun fighting game, although it doesn't have the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 delight that is Let Me Take You for a Ride.

681
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:42,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

682
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:47,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, also they announced Fatal Fury City of the Wolves.

683
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:48,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

684
00:59:49,085 --> 01:00:06,020
[SPEAKER_07]: so that's cool I wonder where they're going with the story in that um but of course we know the original SNK versus Capcom came out on Neo Geo Pocket Color yep so I think it's going to be great you know they're

685
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:20,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also seeing that Mai and Terry Bogard are being released in Street Fighter 6 for Season 2 with Bison and Elena.

686
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:22,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my Sakura, dammit?

687
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:42,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I want her to be in her gym teacher outfit from the end of Street Fighter Alpha 2 and yeah I think it's Vice Immature also DLC characters for King of Fighters 15 and I see something on here but I'm not sure what this came from but

688
01:00:43,090 --> 01:01:11,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Athena from the game Athena not from Psycho Soldier so not like King of Fighters original Athena but the original original Athena that was in the game of the same name old school NES game maybe that's being added for SNK vs. Capcom possibly but anyway I think it's going to be fun I might have to look into it now that I have means of playing it

689
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:41,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in lockstep with Dark Tatsuya's comment over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network who says I wasn't as big on Chaos as I am CVS2 but for 20 bucks I'll consider revisiting it I'm there like this isn't if this was Capcom vs SNK 2 I would be gay screaming flailing crying throwing up all of it I'd be going through all those emotions right now you know what I want them to do but SVC Chaos is okay okay I'm here for that you know what I want them to do hmm

690
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:46,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I want them to just release a game called Ultimate Versus.

691
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:47,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has everyone.

692
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:51,192
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want Mugen?

693
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:54,792
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would rather have something that's actually polished and balanced.

694
01:01:58,313 --> 01:02:07,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Because then I can get my Tatsunoko characters where I can play them on something that I don't have to look to dig out of a box and hook up.

695
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:07,835
Yeah.

696
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:38,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonds006 and DJ Ranma S in chat both echo we all would be in regards to my reaction to CBS 2 News you know what fam I appreciate you all I feel like I feel like I have a new idea for an Orange Knowledge Radio shirt are you ready are you ready screaming flailing crying throwing up together Orange Knowledge Radio we'll see that's my shirt idea

697
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:42,007
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

698
01:02:43,088 --> 01:02:43,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

699
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I have ideas for other shirts.

700
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:56,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people would probably take issue with throwing up on there because, you know, some people have a very big aversion to that, but I hope people understand.

701
01:02:56,281 --> 01:03:11,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be an over-the-top reaction because, I mean, look, if you want to see the literal interpretation of screaming, flailing, crying, throwing up together, go look at

702
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:16,176
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever they do a Nintendo Direct at the Nintendo World Store.

703
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:25,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, go look at when they announced, I want to say it was the original release, or the original announcement of Ultimate Smash Bros.

704
01:03:26,163 --> 01:03:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: When they originally announced that, the Everybody Is Here trailer, go look at the reaction trailer at the Nintendo World Store when that was shown.

705
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:36,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

706
01:03:37,031 --> 01:03:39,293
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says that one kid who passed out.

707
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:39,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

708
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:43,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That is screaming, flailing, crying, throwing up.

709
01:03:43,938 --> 01:03:47,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the physical manifestation of that.

710
01:03:49,313 --> 01:03:51,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have another idea for sure, by the way.

711
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:52,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what's that?

712
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:56,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Money Can't Buy You Love, but it can buy DBD DLC.

713
01:03:57,998 --> 01:03:59,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Or DBD Cosmetics.

714
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty good one.

715
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It can buy in-game cosmetics.

716
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:05,783
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say in-game cosmetics, it's a little more universal.

717
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:06,444
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

718
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:09,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't dress myself, but I can dress my characters.

719
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, let's talk about this.

720
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:19,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a reminder, really, from us to you here at OLR.

721
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:24,482
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox 360 digital store is closing on July 29th.

722
01:04:25,603 --> 01:04:27,465
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

723
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,401
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

724
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:32,484
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Xbox 360 and you know that that one is backwards compatible and all that good stuff so you can see but I'm also like if you don't own Skyrim at this point one way or another like shocked emoji Pikachu shocked emoji if you do not have Skyrim somehow some way at this point but if you have to remedy that you can get that for $4.49 there's other games that are like a buck right now so there's a huge sale going on on Microsoft it might be worth checking out if nothing else

725
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:35,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you can get for free.

726
01:05:35,585 --> 01:05:46,511
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a brand new dynamic background for your Xbox Series X or Xbox One that has the original Blades user interface from the Xbox 360 era.

727
01:05:46,852 --> 01:05:47,992
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't get it twisted.

728
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:53,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to actually turn your Xbox into looking, acting like the Xbox 360.

729
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:58,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to show the Blades on the side and have that same kind of look to it.

730
01:05:58,878 --> 01:05:59,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But the feel...

731
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't gonna be it.

732
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:07,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one last little hurrah if you like to remember your Xbox 360 that way.

733
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, the blades didn't even last the entire life of the 360.

734
01:06:11,088 --> 01:06:13,891
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed that somewhere along the way.

735
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:17,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is kind of nice that they're kind of remembering that there.

736
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S is pointing out, I just picked up Oni Chambara for $2.99.

737
01:06:21,817 --> 01:06:21,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

738
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:22,378
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a deal.

739
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:22,698
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

740
01:06:29,522 --> 01:06:36,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of you are going to be picking up classic games this week on the Xbox 360 big everything must go sale digitally.

741
01:06:37,008 --> 01:06:42,492
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's take a trip down memory lane in this next segment we like to do every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

742
01:06:43,152 --> 01:06:43,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's roll the bumper.

743
01:06:54,338 --> 01:07:01,623
[SPEAKER_06]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

744
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:04,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

745
01:07:05,886 --> 01:07:12,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura, you've got to explain this game of the week because as I understand it, basketball is dead?

746
01:07:14,392 --> 01:07:17,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead, dead, dead, dead and banned.

747
01:07:19,525 --> 01:07:22,186
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is called... Are you ready?

748
01:07:22,446 --> 01:07:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

749
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:25,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody, can you even handle what this game is called?

750
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:27,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready.

751
01:07:27,769 --> 01:07:29,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.

752
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:40,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a freeware roleplay game that was developed by Tales of Games Studio and presented as a joke.

753
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:42,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Shayla, hi!

754
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:58,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, jokingly, as an official sequel to both Barclay's Shut Up and Jam and Space Jam, and it uses JRPG-style battles, and you go through dungeons and everything, and yay!

755
01:07:58,476 --> 01:08:02,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's start at the story.

756
01:08:03,686 --> 01:08:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So the story is that it's in 2041 with a post-cyberpocalyptic Neo-New York.

757
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:10,768
[SPEAKER_07]: That's quotes.

758
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:19,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Charles Barkley performs a powerful chaos dunk at a basketball game and kills most of everybody in attendance.

759
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:25,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And so basketball becomes outlawed and many basketball players are hunted down and killed.

760
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:36,476
[SPEAKER_07]: and then in 2053 another chaos dunk happens in Manhattan and millions die and they all blame Charles Barkley.

761
01:08:38,036 --> 01:08:41,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's being hunted by the B-Ball removal unit led by Michael Jordan.

762
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:55,080
[SPEAKER_07]: He is rescued by another outlaw called the Ultimate Hellbane and they go to the tomb of LeBron James and it gets weirder from there.

763
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:01,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, weird, weird, weird, weird.

764
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:12,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it uses a battle system called the Baby System, B-A-B-B-Y, that is influenced by a bunch of JRPGs.

765
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Babi formed?

766
01:09:14,508 --> 01:09:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Babi formed?

767
01:09:17,605 --> 01:09:19,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Clawstorm says, what in tarnation?

768
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:21,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, yeah.

769
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:26,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So enemies will appear on a field and may run at you and attack if you move into their line of sight.

770
01:09:26,587 --> 01:09:28,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, I guess, Chrono Trigger-like, to be honest.

771
01:09:30,288 --> 01:09:35,409
[SPEAKER_07]: But once the battle is initiated, you have a number of attacks and skills you can use.

772
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:42,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're done kind of like a Mario RPG where they're timed or multiple button presses and accuracy gets you more hits.

773
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:45,631
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

774
01:09:45,651 --> 01:09:45,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

775
01:09:46,909 --> 01:09:48,150
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is fucking weird.

776
01:09:49,531 --> 01:09:52,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I knew it existed, but I...

777
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:59,486
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first time I decided to dust it off and bring it out.

778
01:09:59,546 --> 01:10:03,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is a freeware game, so like, yeah.

779
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:08,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at any rate, it was developed by Tales of Games Studios.

780
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:17,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It was different members from an amateur game development forum.

781
01:10:18,478 --> 01:10:25,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were inspired after there was an awkward phrase on Michael Jordan's Wikipedia page about

782
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:27,844
[SPEAKER_07]: whether or not Space Jam is canon.

783
01:10:29,364 --> 01:10:29,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

784
01:10:29,984 --> 01:10:33,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's canon.

785
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:37,266
[SPEAKER_07]: They were considering like a Looney Tunes series or for Michael Jordan's life.

786
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:43,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were certain members that said, you know, let's just make a game about it.

787
01:10:43,848 --> 01:10:45,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And they developed it in RPG Maker 2003.

788
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:52,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Their names are great because it's Chef Boyardee, Bort, Jeezy, and QuackGyver.

789
01:10:54,731 --> 01:11:22,073
[SPEAKER_07]: but after they developed it in RPG Maker they ported it to Game Maker 6.1 and they were going to release it in both formats but they did it in Game Maker 6.1 because it had more power and flexibility and at the 2014 Awesome Games Done Quick the developers had stated they never played the original Shut Up and Jam and just brainstormed ideas for an RPG that made them laugh

790
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:32,012
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a sequel that they had announced in November 2012 that was since cancelled.

791
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:42,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called The Magical Realms of Ternanog, Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of Kukolin, The Official Game of the Movie, Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley Saga.

792
01:11:42,981 --> 01:11:43,461
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the name.

793
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:47,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter.

794
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:49,866
[SPEAKER_07]: They were...

795
01:11:51,946 --> 01:12:17,960
[SPEAKER_07]: they raised $120,335 by December 28th that year and it was gonna keep the self-aware tone they were doing all the artwork from scratch and then a bunch of people left the project and then the game was cancelled in June 2021 and they just released the source code to the public and that's it

796
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:23,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That is Barkley's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, the RPG.

797
01:12:24,051 --> 01:12:33,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It is available for Windows and Mac OS X. I don't know if it's going to run on any of the modern versions, given that it's probably 32-bit.

798
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:35,376
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

799
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:36,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

800
01:12:37,597 --> 01:12:39,037

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

[SPEAKER_02]: Love a very random indie sort of title.

[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

01:15:41,423 --> 01:15:41,624
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

821
01:15:41,824 --> 01:15:42,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one for you.

822
01:15:43,445 --> 01:15:55,755
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one, I would say, though, the Rogue, it is not the Commodore 64 version of Rogue, which is what I expected, but it's the Amiga version of Rogue, so it actually looks, it's a little more graphical than just, like, ASCII art, which the original, original Rogue was.

823
01:15:55,995 --> 01:15:58,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually will look decent on your Switch, for what it's worth.

824
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:07,944
[SPEAKER_02]: and I only say that because I've played the Commodore 64 edition of Rogue and it's a little rough if you're used to fancy graphics.

825
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:10,405
[SPEAKER_02]: That part hasn't aged well.

826
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:15,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, let's talk about a game that has aged well because it still has its fans.

827
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:20,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Taiko no Tatooine or Taiko Drum Master as it's sometimes known over here in the States.

828
01:16:20,552 --> 01:16:26,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, this surprises me that we've never had an official US arcade launch of Taiko no Tatooine.

829
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:27,997
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had...

830
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:55,069
[SPEAKER_02]: console launches you know console game finally but finally finally Namco Bandai is going to be releasing Taiko no Tatsujin initially at round one then at Dave and Buster's it's actually happening they did a test run and it actually is happening there was an official world championship that happened to Japan this last week and they made some announcements and they mentioned that

831
01:16:55,629 --> 01:17:23,099
[SPEAKER_02]: they will release Taiko no Tatsujin into the US this November so check that out if you have a round one or a Dave and Buster's near you good chance you're going to see one of these machines so that's going to be a lot of fun it's a fun machine to play like I don't think it translates quite as well to home because there's something about banging on that giant fucking drum that's very satisfying that was another game I played at that same arcade that had a

832
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:26,202
[SPEAKER_07]: and Radiant Silvergun.

[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't... There's like 15 versions of Drag Race now.

934
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:07,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't possibly stay on top of them all.

935
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:14,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I started trying to watch Canada vs. the World.

936
01:25:15,058 --> 01:25:15,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

937
01:25:16,746 --> 01:25:28,428

[SPEAKER_02]: The other con was, okay, so I was telling a joke somewhere.

939
01:25:36,704 --> 01:25:41,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't talk about it, but I was telling a joke somewhere and I was doing an impression of Jinx Monsoon.

940
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:47,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And my impression of Jinx Monsoon is to do Jinx Monsoon as Judy Garland, to do that impression.

941
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:48,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandwich.

942
01:25:48,697 --> 01:25:49,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandwich.

943
01:25:50,759 --> 01:26:09,945
[SPEAKER_02]: is that my camera over there and I actually made a joke about I'm not even sure why I am planning on going to DragonCon I thought this was supposed to be DragCon you know DragonCon and DragCon are very similar names but DragCon actually happened this weekend yeah yeah which I don't go to anymore

944
01:26:11,027 --> 01:26:34,071
[SPEAKER_07]: although now if you freaking do uh if you have to do Judy Garland jinx then I have to come out with a scarf tied around my head and a magnifying glass and go well mother dear said that we should never talk to strangers I need to watch Grey Gardens again I'm just saying clearly we have devolved into the part of the show that is we're getting shit up here

945
01:26:34,727 --> 01:26:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we'll talk about anything you want to bring up in chat.

946
01:26:37,748 --> 01:26:39,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you want to give us a call, now's a great time to do so.

947
01:26:39,688 --> 01:26:41,269
[SPEAKER_06]: This is now just chatting.

948
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:43,129
[SPEAKER_02]: This is now a just chatting stream.

949
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:48,951
[SPEAKER_02]: We would usually go to the mailbag over at participate at orangelondrader.com.

950
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:53,772
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that would require the listeners of our wonderful podcast to actually put mail in there.

951
01:26:54,272 --> 01:27:01,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're listening, look, if you have never... It is emptier and drier than Margaret Thatcher's cooch.

952
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:01,414
[SPEAKER_07]: If...

953
01:27:03,857 --> 01:27:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

954
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:09,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of questions on why you just said that, but I'm going to save that for another time.

955
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:13,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Shayla, twat?

956
01:27:14,108 --> 01:27:14,368
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

957
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,371
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Shayla, it was funnier with the first thing.

958
01:27:18,391 --> 01:27:18,692
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

959
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funnier with the twat.

960
01:27:20,553 --> 01:27:22,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So twat, did you say?

961
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:23,356
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

962
01:27:23,396 --> 01:27:23,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

963
01:27:23,756 --> 01:27:25,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't hear you.

964
01:27:26,518 --> 01:27:27,199
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I going to say?

965
01:27:27,379 --> 01:27:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if you are a podcast listener and you have not emailed us, I want to hear from you.

966
01:27:33,144 --> 01:27:34,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know that you exist.

967
01:27:34,825 --> 01:27:35,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

968
01:27:35,346 --> 01:27:37,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just send me an email that says I exist?

969
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:38,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

970
01:27:38,749 --> 01:27:39,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I would love that.

971
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:40,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.

972
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:40,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate.

973
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:42,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Honk if you exist.

974
01:27:42,492 --> 01:27:42,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

975
01:27:43,152 --> 01:27:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Honk if you exist.

976
01:27:44,313 --> 01:27:44,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

977
01:27:45,334 --> 01:27:50,063
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I actually have that as a magnet from Omega Mart.

978
01:27:50,884 --> 01:27:51,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

979
01:27:51,445 --> 01:27:53,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to the phones.

980
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:54,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, what is butter?

981
01:27:55,452 --> 01:27:55,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about it.

982
01:27:56,114 --> 01:27:56,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Fat?

983
01:27:58,755 --> 01:28:10,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I still have to say my favorite thing from Omega Mart for products, apart from gender fluid, because that was great too, was the natural intentions cleaning spray.

984
01:28:10,677 --> 01:28:10,977
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

985
01:28:11,878 --> 01:28:13,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a call on the line.

986
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:14,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to it.

987
01:28:14,138 --> 01:28:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio.

988
01:28:15,218 --> 01:28:15,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

989
01:28:16,618 --> 01:28:19,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know I turned off my air conditioning for this.

990
01:28:19,539 --> 01:28:20,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hell hey, everyone.

991
01:28:20,779 --> 01:28:21,319
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ranma.

992
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:21,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ranma.

993
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see you.

994
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,080
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

995
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,160
[SPEAKER_01]: It is muggy as fuck up there.

996
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:47,869
[SPEAKER_01]: well it's not that it's just that the way my studio is set up the air conditioner is right behind the monitor where the window is so I have to turn the AC off which is great but like an hour into my live stream I'm just like no I'm sweating worse than a sinner at the club on a Saturday night you know what is on your mind my friend

997
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple of things.

998
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:54,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, I went to a convention yesterday called Collecticon.

999
01:28:54,401 --> 01:29:01,526
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the country's biggest anime, gaming, trading card convention out there.

1000
01:29:01,806 --> 01:29:13,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, please, please, please reassure me because when I hear Collecticon, my image that comes to my mind is that there are so many Funko Pops being shit out of that dealer room.

1001
01:29:13,793 --> 01:29:15,394
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many Funko Pops.

1002
01:29:17,192 --> 01:29:19,455
[SPEAKER_01]: My fabulous brother in Christ, you ain't wrong.

1003
01:29:21,537 --> 01:29:23,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my bookshelf, okay?

1004
01:29:23,779 --> 01:29:27,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, DarkSakura, you don't have a fucking camera.

1005
01:29:27,684 --> 01:29:27,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch.

1006
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:28,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1007
01:29:29,005 --> 01:29:29,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyway.

1008
01:29:30,876 --> 01:29:38,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, let me tell you, most of these comic conventions, they need to call them Funko PopCon because a third of the dealers are selling pops anywhere from $10 to $300.

1009
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:43,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why they're expensive is because they aren't autographed.

1010
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:44,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

1011
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:45,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep them.

1012
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:50,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to address something that Clawstorm is saying in chat, saying DragonCon has entered the chat.

1013
01:29:50,163 --> 01:29:52,964
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest you say, okay, you ain't wrong, however...

1014
01:29:53,584 --> 01:30:23,002
[SPEAKER_02]: DragonCon's vendor room is so fucking big it's four stories fucking big that sure I can get Funko Pops but I can also get like a kilt a sword an unopened pack of Tron trading cards from the 1980s which I actually fucking bought one year you can get a lot of shit at the DragonCon dealer hall I don't doubt it see that just reminds me you can buy a dragon yes you can

1015
01:30:27,741 --> 01:30:49,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost positive somewhere in that dealer hall is a dragon con that you can blow smoke out of like a dragon would breathe fire I'm positive that is a thing I've seen in the dealer hall you know, a tobacco pipe anyway I had to play on Shayla says buy a dragon and name him Jeremy

1016
01:30:51,536 --> 01:31:17,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry Ranma, we were talking about you had a topic here and we derailed it tonight because DarkSakura and I are misbehaving tonight when aren't y'all derailing and misbehaving, I mean really we kind of like it, it's like mods away, post away we live, we live it's shit posting time exactly anyway what do you want

1017
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:24,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want to be like that about it, I'm just fucking with you.

1018
01:31:25,797 --> 01:31:26,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, Rob.

1019
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:30,401
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1020
01:31:31,302 --> 01:31:44,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to this convention and I was on the line for about an hour to get a particular autograph from somebody that we've discussed on this podcast more than one time.

1021
01:31:45,462 --> 01:31:47,663
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm kicking it out of the box.

1022
01:31:47,683 --> 01:31:50,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just give you an autograph for free, Ranchan.

1023
01:31:50,664 --> 01:31:51,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Martinet?

1024
01:31:51,985 --> 01:31:55,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Charles Martinet autographed my Luigi figure.

1025
01:31:55,526 --> 01:31:57,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how's Grandpa doing?

1026
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:58,667
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about him in a while.

1027
01:31:58,707 --> 01:32:05,050
[SPEAKER_02]: How's his Mario ambassadorship and apparently Luigi ambassadorship, how's that treating him?

1028
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:06,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going well.

1029
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:08,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you something.

1030
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:09,992
[SPEAKER_01]: He has special stuff autographed.

1031
01:32:10,312 --> 01:32:14,274
[SPEAKER_01]: He is selling autographed Famicom, Super Famicom, N64,

1032
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:19,241
[SPEAKER_01]: and cards up to $400.

1033
01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:20,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Gimme.

1034
01:32:20,722 --> 01:32:22,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Make that fucking coin, Uncle Charles.

1035
01:32:22,722 --> 01:32:23,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Make that coin.

1036
01:32:23,383 --> 01:32:27,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a picture of the layout and I will post it later so you can check it out.

1037
01:32:27,984 --> 01:32:30,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did my Luigi voice for him and he loved it.

1038
01:32:31,405 --> 01:32:32,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Aww, I love that.

1039
01:32:33,766 --> 01:32:35,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, did you go dressed as Black Luigi?

1040
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:41,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I could not because I was there with one of my partners.

1041
01:32:41,966 --> 01:32:53,954
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually did Mamoru and Usagi from Sailor Moon because Terry Hawks, one of the original English dubs of Usagi, Serena, was there, so we went to get a picture with them.

1042
01:32:54,514 --> 01:32:58,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't she also the one who was on Beverly Hills Teens as Bianca?

1043
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:01,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1044
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Garth the Wolf in chat has a very valid request asking, Ranma, could you do your Luigi voice now?

1045
01:33:09,095 --> 01:33:11,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Luigi, number one superstar.

1046
01:33:12,537 --> 01:33:12,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1047
01:33:13,277 --> 01:33:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1048
01:33:14,258 --> 01:33:14,598
[SPEAKER_02]: A plus.

1049
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,001
[SPEAKER_02]: You win five QR codes.

1050
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:22,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad you got to meet Charles Martinet.

1051
01:33:22,202 --> 01:33:22,923
[SPEAKER_02]: He's such a nice guy.

1052
01:33:23,638 --> 01:33:24,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was really chill.

1053
01:33:24,979 --> 01:33:26,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the line was long.

1054
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:31,701
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love seeing the fact there were people getting non-Mario stuff by him signing.

1055
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:35,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about Luigi, Wario, Waluigi stuff.

1056
01:33:36,023 --> 01:33:36,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt good.

1057
01:33:37,263 --> 01:33:37,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1058
01:33:37,763 --> 01:33:39,284
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm glad.

1059
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:44,146
[SPEAKER_02]: His name hasn't come up in a while ever since we know that Mario Brothers Wonder had a new voice actor and all that stuff.

1060
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:47,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really glad that the convention circuit life is treating him well.

1061
01:33:47,327 --> 01:33:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for him.

1062
01:33:49,168 --> 01:33:49,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Telling me.

1063
01:33:51,564 --> 01:34:14,234
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is something else I want to discuss real quick between getting this autograph and the conversations of like a lot of retro games and so forth I kind of want to say that I'm done with video games that are first person third person to an extent I'm kind of tired of it what do you mean I mean

1064
01:34:15,939 --> 01:34:17,320
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1065
01:34:40,327 --> 01:34:41,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just, like, 2D games.

1066
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:44,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I want more 2D action-adventure games.

1067
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:52,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they just announced a Karate Kid arcade-style beat-em-up, like, in the vein of Turtle Shredder's Revenge.

1068
01:34:52,637 --> 01:34:56,160
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a day-one purchase for me, digital and physical.

1069
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see more of that, because... I don't know, I'm just...

1070
01:35:03,752 --> 01:35:06,113
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, old man sitting on the porch in the rocking chair.

1071
01:35:06,193 --> 01:35:09,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass me a butterscotch disc because... Stop screaming at the clouds.

1072
01:35:09,515 --> 01:35:10,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1073
01:35:11,777 --> 01:35:13,598
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was laughing.

1074
01:35:15,139 --> 01:35:19,382
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said, I don't like first person or third person, I was with Clawstorm in chat.

1075
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:20,202
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that leave?

1076
01:35:21,003 --> 01:35:21,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Second person?

1077
01:35:21,964 --> 01:35:23,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Second person.

1078
01:35:23,244 --> 01:35:28,388
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very difficult... I think second person is with Deadpool, but that's a different type of thing.

1079
01:35:28,428 --> 01:35:28,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1080
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:49,487
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, I do enjoy some first person shooters, action adventure games and third person ones, but I'm just like I don't know, maybe I just feel the longing of yesteryear when I was a teenager you sat down, you put in Super Mario World and you just played the heck out of that game or Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past and you went through it, you know

1081
01:35:50,288 --> 01:35:55,211
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, maybe it's just, I just feel all the tech we have in these consoles, the power.

1082
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:59,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I want to see like the perfect arcade portable classic game or something like that.

1083
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:08,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a new arcade game, a new game that's in the arcade style that makes it feel like back when I was 12 years old, shucking quarters into Gauntlet, you know?

1084
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to translate what you're saying for our listeners.

1085
01:36:12,382 --> 01:36:12,762
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?

1086
01:36:12,782 --> 01:36:14,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1087
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:16,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1088
01:36:35,816 --> 01:36:45,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to the video games I just put in a quarter and I played for five minutes and that fucking thing would rob me blind and then I'd just go eat some cheap-ass cardboard pizza and call it a day.

1089
01:36:46,518 --> 01:36:49,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But Rob... You tell them, Grandpa Rob.

1090
01:36:49,699 --> 01:36:50,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You tell them.

1091
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get my cane and show my solidarity.

1092
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna shove this cane up your ass.

1093
01:36:56,481 --> 01:37:01,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in my day, we only had monochrome and there were two bits and we liked it.

1094
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:05,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm just fucking with you because I love you.

1095
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:07,942
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

1096
01:37:09,482 --> 01:37:10,822
[SPEAKER_05]: You are sound in the game.

1097
01:37:16,603 --> 01:37:19,364
[SPEAKER_04]: If that console doesn't have a black and white switch, I don't want it.

1098
01:37:23,424 --> 01:37:29,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look, I enjoy modern first person games, but it's like all these buttons.

1099
01:37:29,466 --> 01:37:31,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to pick up a game.

1100
01:37:32,284 --> 01:37:33,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Punch, kick, jump, that's it.

1101
01:37:34,246 --> 01:37:37,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just roll, and I'll just sit there for hours upon hours.

1102
01:37:37,649 --> 01:37:38,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1103
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:44,315
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says, that's how Gen Z looks at us boomers.

1104
01:37:44,355 --> 01:37:45,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a boomer?

1105
01:37:46,077 --> 01:37:46,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Boomers?

1106
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:49,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a boomer, TigerClaw?

1107
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm a fucking Xeniel.

1108
01:37:52,483 --> 01:37:53,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, bitch.

1109
01:37:53,684 --> 01:37:53,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait.

1110
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Claw is older than us, but hold up.

1111
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:57,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.

1112
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:58,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.

1113
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:01,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not make me come down there with my cane and beat you.

1114
01:38:02,171 --> 01:38:02,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do it.

1115
01:38:03,532 --> 01:38:03,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

1116
01:38:04,252 --> 01:38:07,413
[SPEAKER_01]: You just channeled my inner Gen X rage, boy.

1117
01:38:08,273 --> 01:38:17,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, if you're a boomer, then... I don't know if the first video game you played might have been on the spectroscope or something.

1118
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:18,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember Mimeographs?

1119
01:38:19,416 --> 01:38:21,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, don't answer that because I remember Mimeographs.

1120
01:38:22,217 --> 01:38:22,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.

1121
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:25,832
[SPEAKER_07]: The smell of ink.

1122
01:38:26,392 --> 01:38:29,373
[SPEAKER_07]: The delicious smell of ink.

1123
01:38:29,473 --> 01:38:32,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the fuck happened to this call, but I say that about this show a lot.

1124
01:38:33,635 --> 01:38:36,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, anything else on your mind tonight you want to share with us?

1125
01:38:36,776 --> 01:38:41,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one thing for Jamie, in case she hasn't heard.

1126
01:38:41,897 --> 01:38:42,137
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1127
01:38:43,318 --> 01:38:44,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new Ranma 1.5.

1128
01:38:45,338 --> 01:38:45,599
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1129
01:38:46,299 --> 01:38:46,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes!

1130
01:38:48,199 --> 01:38:48,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch, where?

1131
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:50,640
[SPEAKER_01]: October 5th.

1132
01:38:52,541 --> 01:38:53,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Original voices?

1133
01:38:54,076 --> 01:39:00,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, except for Ukyo, Nabiki, Tsukimi, and Happosai.

1134
01:39:00,339 --> 01:39:01,900
[SPEAKER_01]: They are dead.

1135
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:05,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be sad not having my Ukyo.

1136
01:39:06,922 --> 01:39:08,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Studio Mappa is doing it.

1137
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:13,045
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be on Nippon Television.

1138
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:17,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, distribution rights are going to Netflix.

1139
01:39:18,174 --> 01:39:18,735
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1140
01:39:18,975 --> 01:39:19,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

1141
01:39:19,455 --> 01:39:20,436
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet exists.

1142
01:39:20,516 --> 01:39:22,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Get me some fan subs, bitch!

1143
01:39:22,699 --> 01:39:34,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is premiering the first episode of Anime NYC and I do believe there's going to be a certain Black Ranma that's going to try to be at the front of that line with the trivia, so you know how that goes.

1144
01:39:34,731 --> 01:39:36,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I will send you a spatula from here.

1145
01:39:37,449 --> 01:39:38,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you will.

1146
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:39,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy because you're happy.

1147
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:41,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I may not be the anime connoisseur.

1148
01:39:41,653 --> 01:39:43,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I do actually have a collection of Okonomiyaki Spatulae.

1149
01:39:44,475 --> 01:39:49,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not be the anime connoisseur that you are, but I know your name is Ranma and you love that show and I'm happy you're happy.

1150
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,883
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm wearing this specific, what?

1151
01:39:54,423 --> 01:39:55,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific t-shirt tonight.

1152
01:39:55,664 --> 01:40:00,748
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who are listening, I have an anime shirt decked out in the style of Marvel vs. Capcom.

1153
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:01,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

1154
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:02,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1155
01:40:03,404 --> 01:40:13,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know how many people, though, of our general age, were introduced to Urasayatsura by watching Matthew Sweet's video for I've Been Waiting.

1156
01:40:14,756 --> 01:40:19,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, but I actually know someone who actually worked on the first movie.

1157
01:40:20,502 --> 01:40:20,943
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

1158
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:27,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we were in Discord on our old school chat just watching the new series and talking about it and stuff.

1159
01:40:27,555 --> 01:40:27,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

1160
01:40:28,836 --> 01:40:46,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a big fan of Matthew Sweet in like the early 90s and he put out two videos that used anime footage and one of them was Urosayatsura for I've Been Waiting and the other one was from Cobra, which kind of a racy anime, but it was for Girlfriend.

1161
01:40:47,673 --> 01:40:48,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Adventure Cobra?

1162
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:49,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1163
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Spaceship Adventure.

1164
01:40:52,891 --> 01:40:57,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched it when I shouldn't have been watching it, but it was cartoon.

1165
01:40:57,172 --> 01:40:57,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

1166
01:40:57,732 --> 01:40:59,773
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not wrong.

1167
01:41:01,353 --> 01:41:07,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, I'm sitting here watching the Zenki OAV.

1168
01:41:09,315 --> 01:41:12,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine going from the series of Zenki and then to the OAV version.

1169
01:41:12,356 --> 01:41:13,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit got weird.

1170
01:41:13,756 --> 01:41:13,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1171
01:41:15,137 --> 01:41:15,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1172
01:41:16,097 --> 01:41:19,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, I appreciate the phone call, but I'm gonna let you go.

1173
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful week, and of course, all this and much more on Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights, also part of the Voice Geeks Network.

1174
01:41:28,223 --> 01:41:31,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to hearing about how Anime NYC goes for you with all that.

1175
01:41:32,205 --> 01:41:32,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

1176
01:41:33,146 --> 01:41:39,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, because of the storm that happened over the weekend, I do not have to go in at 6am.

1177
01:41:39,269 --> 01:41:42,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to be in until about 8.30 to kind of fan the flames.

1178
01:41:43,804 --> 01:41:45,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because you work too late on Friday.

1179
01:41:45,745 --> 01:41:46,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck to you.

1180
01:41:47,747 --> 01:41:48,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I pray for you.

1181
01:41:48,768 --> 01:41:51,830
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny part was mostly the LA office had to deal with the brunt end.

1182
01:41:52,131 --> 01:41:59,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I am putting a sign at my desk that says if your machine is blue screening, just send an email to the service desk and we'll get to you as soon as we can.

1183
01:41:59,897 --> 01:42:00,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it on and off again.

1184
01:42:00,898 --> 01:42:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

1185
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,662
[SPEAKER_07]: If your computer has a blue screen, switch to Mac.

1186
01:42:09,285 --> 01:42:11,507
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another hot topic debate at work, but

1187
01:42:11,986 --> 01:42:12,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, really?

1188
01:42:13,247 --> 01:42:13,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joking.

1189
01:42:14,347 --> 01:42:15,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Turning it off and turning it back on?

1190
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:17,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Works nine times out of ten.

1191
01:42:17,968 --> 01:42:21,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a pin on the way that says, did you turn it off and back on?

1192
01:42:23,091 --> 01:42:23,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1193
01:42:23,851 --> 01:42:25,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap it up.

1194
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:26,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for calling in.

1195
01:42:26,692 --> 01:42:27,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you.

1196
01:42:28,113 --> 01:42:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Love y'all.

1197
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:29,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

1198
01:42:30,409 --> 01:42:30,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1199
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:34,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, always a pleasure to hear from our pal Ranma.

1200
01:42:34,971 --> 01:42:37,292
[SPEAKER_02]: With that though, we are towards the end of the show.

1201
01:42:37,352 --> 01:42:39,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We would usually do last minute stories, but I don't have any.

1202
01:42:39,753 --> 01:42:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: We were kind of scraping the stories we could get anyway.

1203
01:42:43,274 --> 01:42:45,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're at that part where we get everybody's final thought.

1204
01:42:45,355 --> 01:42:48,116
[SPEAKER_06]: We were like, please sir, may I have another?

1205
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:50,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ever so hungry for email.

1206
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:51,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Or stories.

1207
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, are you streaming tonight or are you taking a break because of yesterday?

1208
01:42:55,859 --> 01:42:56,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm

1209
01:42:57,219 --> 01:43:11,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna do it cause I wanna play with Shay cause Shay's here and Shay is like Shay is like the ghost in my life sometimes she's awake and then she's there to play with and sometimes I'm like where is a Shay?

1210
01:43:12,484 --> 01:43:25,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Shay is asleep alright well let me go ahead and get your final thought now since I have no Loki to banter with here I have to give you the I have to fill the time here before we toss it over to you so I'll go ahead and let you have your final thought

1211
01:43:26,004 --> 01:43:30,959
[SPEAKER_02]: buy all our playsets and toys alright thanks DarkSakura, have a good night

1212
01:43:33,242 --> 01:43:33,823
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1213
01:43:34,383 --> 01:43:38,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, I can't believe it, but it's just me left.

1214
01:43:38,987 --> 01:43:42,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of a scary notion here.

1215
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:48,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, thank you as always for listening to the show.

1216
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:49,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word.

1217
01:43:49,735 --> 01:43:55,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell a friend about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1218
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:59,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube,

1219
01:43:59,562 --> 01:44:02,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Spotify, wherever it is that you found this podcast.

1220
01:44:02,043 --> 01:44:04,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes an awful long way and we really appreciate it.

1221
01:44:04,783 --> 01:44:08,364
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be back again next week to talk about the things that happen in gaming this week.

1222
01:44:08,404 --> 01:44:11,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be very interesting what develops with the FTC and all that good stuff.

1223
01:44:11,705 --> 01:44:16,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki will be back next week so we can hear all about how things have been for him since it will have been a few weeks at that point.

1224
01:44:16,947 --> 01:44:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, with that, I want to thank all of you that came out to our chat room tonight.

1225
01:44:20,868 --> 01:44:21,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you.

1226
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:22,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here live.

1227
01:44:23,509 --> 01:44:24,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that.

1228
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:27,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just leaves me with my final thought tonight, which is...

1229
01:44:30,311 --> 01:44:31,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to be streaming again.

1230
01:44:31,893 --> 01:44:34,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like two weeks since I've done a stream because I've been sick.

1231
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Being sick sucks.

1232
01:44:36,876 --> 01:44:37,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get sick.

1233
01:44:37,877 --> 01:44:38,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I advised against it.

1234
01:44:39,038 --> 01:44:40,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a horrible time.

1235
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much everybody.

1236
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:43,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great night.

1237
01:44:43,942 --> 01:44:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.

1238
01:44:44,742 --> 01:44:44,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1239
01:44:47,164 --> 01:44:49,606
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1240
01:44:51,687 --> 01:44:54,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
