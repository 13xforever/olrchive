9640	17122	The subheader for one of tonight's stories referring to the PS5 Pro's paid optical disc drive accessory says, The beefed up console is lacking a pretty important feature right out of the box.
17442	18262	Is it pretty important?
18522	24583	Maybe for the now minority of people that want it, who I guess is the article's target audience, physical media is increasingly a minority need.
24703	26784	If you want that capability, it's time to pay for it.
26924	28644	Is this what being a politician feels like?
28964	30185	This is my punditry intro.
30345	34945	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somerson, Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35126	37166	Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.
39192	46817	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46917	58925	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1017 of our show for tonight, September the 15th of 2024.
59366	66050	My name is Rob Roberts and not joining us at the moment but will be here shortly as on the way is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66110	67411	They are running just a little bit behind us.
69072	90143	OLR will not be here next week because TwitchCon's going on and both you and DarkSakura are going and she's been before and has talked at length about it on the show but this is going to actually be it this is your very first like TwitchCon coming up this weekend like ever right?
90751	91971	Yes, ever, yeah.
91991	93552	It'll be interesting.
93812	93992	Yeah?
94012	94952	What are you kind of, like, looking for?
94972	97812	You were talking about you kind of set up an aggressive schedule this week, right?
97852	98752	What are you looking forward to?
99112	104533	Well, I've been trying to, like, plan out my... Because I'm going for all three days and the day before.
106054	118316	So, right now, I mean, I have a pretty loaded schedule in terms of, like, a lot of stuff surrounding MCC and Nox Crew, so there's a few different...
119216	121657	events that I've been invited to.
121757	124699	Some I don't know what they are, some I do know what they are.
125459	134984	There's different meet and greets, different panels that I was going to try to check out, all mostly Minecraft related, except for meet and greet with Doug Doug.
136085	136785	He's just funny, but...
138547	140068	Yeah, it's going to be pretty busy.
141228	147290	And over in our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
147310	152072	That's VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
152352	157695	And the previously mentioned Bobby Blackwolf is in chat saying, wait, you got invited to things at TwitchCon?
158735	160296	It doesn't happen very often.
160396	160636	Yeah.
163816	166297	Rolling out the red carpet for Loki's first year.
166937	171320	Alright, one other quick thing I want to ask you about, and then we'll go over to DarkSakura who just joined us.
171440	181125	I want to mention, Loki, the game playing behind you tonight is Astro Bot for the PlayStation 5, which really feels like it's taken the gaming world by storm, quite frankly.
182145	187428	I have not picked this game up myself yet because I bought cheaper games this week, but
187828	194269	I have to say, a lot of the hype for this game is really making me go, alright, maybe I do need to pick this up at full price.
194349	200711	Like, even though this screams the type of game that Sony would give away in a year on PS Plus, I feel like I need to pick this up right away.
201071	205172	I'm feeling like this might be a game of the year contender at the Game Awards.
205332	206632	I really am getting that vibe.
206852	208513	Yeah, it's looked pretty good.
208573	214494	Like, I would have picked it up if I had a PlayStation 5, but I don't, so I'm not purchasing a system for this, but...
215875	216335	It looks good.
216375	219718	It looks like on level with Mario Odyssey or something like that.
219938	220199	Yeah.
220539	225643	Well, you're going to have the chance to get a PlayStation 5 for $700, but we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
225764	229967	First, I want to say hello to, of course, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
233190	234711	And I hope you're doing well tonight, Jamie.
234752	235012	I don't know.
235052	237314	It's not coming through, but sometimes it takes a second to tune in.
238154	239395	My microphone is on.
239435	239775	There we go.
239795	242698	I don't know why, but sometimes if it's just a quick high, it doesn't come through, but that's all right.
242998	243458	How are you doing?
243478	245760	You also sound like you're talking a thousand miles a minute.
246200	246881	Well, what else is new?
249663	253446	I just want to point out, I just had a fresh cup of coffee, so yes.
254813	261277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
280235	302398	it's okay it's okay I have been really I don't know what it is I've just been really like having extra fatigue lately yeah and it's been like I've just been like the combination of my week and everything just getting ready for TwitchCon I have been I've been
303447	305489	Pretty poopified.
305629	306790	Yeah, I understand.
306810	309091	I hope you hang in there okay.
309332	314295	Since you mentioned TwitchCon as well, what does it look like for you?
314335	316177	What are you excited about for this year's TwitchCon?
317858	318218	Going.
320921	324784	I'm excited about wearing my platform tall heel Crocs.
325600	326561	Oh my gosh.
326941	329164	Wasn't Crocs a sponsor in Vegas?
329544	330685	Last year, yep.
330785	331906	That's what I thought.
331926	332667	That's so funny.
332767	337992	And I hope they are again so I can go into my Crocs and say, get ready to sponsor me, bitches.
339994	340334	I love it.
340374	340655	I love it.
341495	342817	You're cosplaying as well, right?
343894	346976	Yeah, I'm doing two different pig cosmetics.
348117	353201	I am doing my normal one that I wear with the drill weapon and the red shirt and the crown.
354021	356583	And then I'm also doing the outfit that goes with the crown.
356943	364189	So the short skirt, the thigh high fishnets, combat boots, the purple shirt from the first movie.
364209	364569	Mm-hmm.
365495	379440	and I discovered something Rob something I can get away with instead of having to wear an uncomfortable skirt that I can't move in I'm buying a fucking tennis skirt with like a skort type one with the shorts underneath it oh nice
381020	382281	Hey, you know what?
382381	384861	Function before fashion when it comes to conventions.
385101	394304	I don't know how some of these Dragon Con, like, you know, which, and I bring that up because obviously it's like a cost, it's cosplay heaven or cosplay hell, depending on how you look at it.
395045	399406	But Dragon Con, some people go all out and I don't know how they do it because the function.
399706	401287	They do it at Anime Cons too.
401787	405488	We had a big daddy at TwitchCon two years ago.
405688	406328	Come on, daddy.
406949	407789	We had a Reptar.
409943	410483	Rob, what?
435905	437446	Pink elephant is if you're drunk.
438926	439747	It's just elephant.
439887	440447	All right, fine.
440907	446890	We have to address the blue elephant in the room about what's been going on this week.
447210	452773	And you may have seen on social media that it is official.
453453	459516	We are in a Guinness publication as the longest running English language magazine.
460694	462175	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
485583	489226	So I think they had to, you know, probably research and update a few things.
502496	513686	but I happened to log into the OLR account because I think there was a gaming news story where there was a headline or something and I saw the little mail icon and I was like, oh, what's this?
514127	516329	And then when I saw what it was, I almost choked.
516869	526258	So I emailed the individual from Guinness who reached out with some basic information but to be fair, I didn't really know what it was going to be.
526778	528319	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
541172	544196	and as you all may recall, it changed.
544717	551525	So it's kind of funny because if we hadn't posted about it on Twitter, the individual may not have seen it and actually changed the date.
551565	557833	So it's right in the book, but that's only because they changed the date at the literal like last second for them whenever their deadline was.
558749	559490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
576826	579788	They wanted something like, can you get us something by tomorrow?
580629	587695	And I couldn't get the three of us together to take a new picture, and we just didn't have a lot of pictures as a group.
588135	591638	We had only really done two official publicity shoots.
592098	593379	There was the one you see in the book.
593920	601846	Actually, that was Mistress Tia that shot that photo from the very last non-to-go edition of OLR ever.
602026	603688	Just a little fun history there.
603728	604869	Mistress Tia shot that photo.
606310	622188	and let me think there was one other publicity photo thing we did a few years later with Eddie rest in peace actually came over and shot us you might recall this is when we were in the garage studio on Justin TV and
622788	635958	and the picture I liked the best from that was the one, so there's a really funny picture of us sitting around the table and like Loki's on an old ass brick laptop, DarkSakura's, no, DarkSakura's on the laptop.
636399	638180	Loki is talking into an Xbox 360.
638581	639741	That was my Toshiba.
640182	644705	Yeah, and I was playing a Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS, but a DS.
645026	648068	And there's a big old bottle of Goldschlager on the table.
648528	651330	So I actually don't think that picture would have been suitable for print anyway.
652905	659271	The one that we sent was easy enough for them to remove the background from.
659451	659992	Exactly.
660272	661233	So it worked out.
662034	670842	If we'd known, the funny thing is, you, me, and Loki got together for the 1,000th episode and we took pictures in front of Golf Land and put that on social media.
671182	673204	And that would have been a great thing to have in the book.
673364	675106	Unfortunately, that was already past their deadline.
675566	676386	So it is what it is.
676567	677667	You make do with what you have, right?
677907	678948	Like, how could we know?
679048	680769	Like, it's just, you know, when these things happen, they happen.
681089	685851	We weren't even 100% positive that it was going to be, like, for the longest running, you know, podcast.
685871	689473	We thought, oh, maybe we'll be just mentioned, like, on a list or something.
689593	692834	Yeah, we didn't know if, like, we were like, who else did they contact?
692934	693955	I actually asked Bobby.
693995	696436	I said, because, like, you know, I trust Bobby to keep his mouth shut.
696816	698117	I said, Bobby, did they contact you?
698217	698877	And he said, no.
699057	700098	You know, so I was like, okay.
700578	705781	Maybe they reached out to like and I'm thinking like maybe like Gamer Tag Radio has been on a long time.
707483	708023	What was the show?
708043	710204	The Outsider, Video Game Outsider has been a long time.
710605	711925	Maybe they reached out some of the other shows.
712006	712386	I don't know.
712726	715268	Well, turns out in the book and I do want to address this.
715948	724092	In the book, they actually acknowledge another podcast out of Spain called Game Over, and they actually give them the distinction of the longest running podcast.
724432	731255	And we have the distinction of the longest running English language podcast, which when you consider that the book is English language, it's important.
731975	739979	And I want to choose my words carefully here because I do not want to mean any disrespect to these hardworking individuals at the Game Over podcast in Spain.
740899	743621	Unfortunately, I can't listen to it because I don't speak the language.
743661	744481	I wouldn't understand it.
745381	746942	But I'm sure they work very hard.
747202	748043	I know very well.
748183	749784	Loki, DarkSakura, we all know very well.
749804	753326	It takes a heck of a lot of discipline to do this for a long time.
754006	763892	That all being said, in the promotion we use for Orange Lounge Radio, in the descriptions on social media and things, we say longest running video game podcast.
764392	765553	And we're not going to change that.
766093	767033	And I'm going to tell you why.
767234	771136	And again, I got to be careful here because I don't mean this with any disrespect.
772099	782443	However, from what I have done the research on the Game Over podcast out of Spain, they kind of start and stop a little bit.
783183	787325	And I think it's a little bit hard to call yourself the longest running player.
787765	788485	Thank you for watching!
803570	804771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
823843	824844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
850587	853831	We are currently on episode number 1017.
854011	856114	Now have we been able to be on every week?
856634	856874	No.
857255	865384	Things are going to happen and I'm not going to apologize for taking a winter vacation or when my mother passed away we were out for two weeks.
865464	868307	I think these are all fairly reasonable things.
868928	877614	But this other show, and again, respectful, oldest podcast maybe, but not longest running.
878274	881737	When you're taking every summer off and you've taken an entire year off.
882217	892124	So that is the logic that we are going to continue to use and why we will continue to brand ourselves the longest running podcast about video games until we are no longer on.
893064	897047	Frodo Swaggins in chat says, video game outsiders claims to be the longest running also.
898248	898348	No.
899509	901230	You know, again, I want to be respectful.
901350	903092	We used to be on the same network with those guys.
903512	905514	I have no hard feelings or anything.
905874	906715	They are hardworking.
906855	910058	Michelle was even a guest on a show about Warcraft I did once.
911059	912000	Fine group of folks.
912540	917264	But if that is what is being claimed, and I understand this is coming through a game of telephone.
917785	921148	If they are saying they are one of the longest running, that's different.
921248	921949	They can say that.
922509	926071	But if it is the longest running, unfortunately, that is incorrect.
926731	933295	And I've given you all the evidence you need as far as our claim to it.
934256	936697	Well, the thing is, they know better.
937350	941013	Yeah, and so again, I'm going to hope, again, I want you to listen for this.
941093	945836	If they're saying they are one of the longest running, that's fine.
946416	947477	None of us have an issue with that.
947597	950479	But if they say longest running, that should be corrected.
950959	952040	And I hope they will do that.
952120	956443	And yes, they should know because we were on the same network, All Games Radio, for quite some time.
957324	957464	So...
959293	960114	But nothing but the best.
960414	960775	You know what?
961215	967580	Quite frankly, if you are still going, like any of these shows I mentioned, there's a lot of other hard-working, long-running shows out there.
969942	971844	I'd like to think we're celebrating with you.
972044	977589	It takes a lot of discipline to do this for one year, let alone over 20.
979090	982873	So everybody should be proud of what they've accomplished.
982913	985695	But that is also, if it sounds like we're being dicks about this...
986636	997159	that's why because we worked hard for this title we're going to hang on to it yes we are so hope you understand hope you understand um
998476	998916	That's that.
999477	1001778	Anything else, DarkSakura and Loki, you want to add about this?
1001838	1005400	I mean, I've been talking, but obviously you all share in this 100%.
1007301	1012284	I did reach out through a couple of channels to see about getting our certificates.
1012685	1016827	And I actually submitted an application because we were awarded this without an application.
1017488	1018488	Yeah, yeah.
1018608	1024352	So I wanted to have everything above the table, as it were.
1024372	1024632	Mm-hmm.
1025666	1045918	and so I've put in an official application with under us as a group and with our names on there and copied and pasted verbatim thank you text copy from preview everything that was in the article page number publication date all of it like you guys wrote this about us I'm not making it up
1047907	1050990	And if two of us, we've got stage names listed.
1051670	1054252	Well, and two of them are right.
1054933	1058856	And I guess I should address, they put the wrong name for me in there.
1059097	1060718	And I think I know what they did.
1061178	1062499	But I'm just going to say...
1063700	1066782	I would not have been upset if they put Rob... Well, I'm not upset.
1067042	1070004	This is just my luck and I just roll my eyes and have fun with it.
1070465	1077369	But if it had said Rob Sky, S-K-I-E, Roberts, I would have been like, all right, yeah, I used that nickname for a very, very long time.
1077389	1078450	That goes back to DDR Freak.
1078850	1079651	I ain't mad about it.
1080011	1081332	Where V comes from...
1083298	1085558	I just wanna walk around with my mug I'm a winner baby
1113223	1122046	But in serious, you know, you bring up a good point, DarkSakura, is that we had actually asked six years ago, five, no, it was when the 20th, you did it for the 20th.
1122606	1130189	We sent them, you sent them a contact and they said basically pay us because they saw Orange Lounge Radio.
1130229	1131209	They said, you're a business.
1131449	1133710	You're going to have to pay a thousand dollars to be considered.
1133730	1135810	And we were like, we don't have that kind of money.
1135951	1139312	No, they said I put in the wrong application and that I had to reapply.
1139532	1139772	Well.
1140572	1142756	Well, but the application they wanted had the money, right?
1143177	1147043	Well, that's if you wanted to push it through.
1147063	1148065	Oh, well...
1148843	1152946	It's like a $5 application fee for just doing a standard 12-week application.
1153506	1163393	Regardless, we have this Gamers Edition probably to thank for the fact that it came back for this distinction.
1163533	1173279	So thank you to the editors at the Guinness Gamers Edition for finding us and for giving us the distinction.
1173340	1174300	It's super appreciated.
1174380	1175121	We really appreciate it.
1175141	1175881	Yeah.
1176282	1176982	All right.
1178021	1181044	And thank you again to all of you that have supported us over the years.
1181324	1182485	You all share in this too.
1182565	1184147	You all have been a part of this.
1184627	1190292	You all get to say you have been part of what is now a Guinness World Record holding podcast.
1190312	1190713	Yeah, it's your fault.
1190733	1193055	And I think that's pretty fucking phenomenal.
1193715	1195497	So thank you.
1195537	1196458	Loki, anything you want to add?
1198059	1203304	No, I just think it's really exciting to finally be acknowledged, you know, without having to, you know,
1204352	1204852	I mean, I don't know, maybe.
1219366	1229797	Well, you know, it's in going back to what somebody else had brought up a moment ago and chat about potentially other shows claiming they're the longest running because they just they don't know about us.
1230397	1235923	You know, it is it is nice to see that Guinness did the homework to figure it out.
1236123	1238285	And that's that's very kind.
1238566	1239346	And that does.
1239627	1242229	Yeah, that does feel nice because, you know,
1243488	1250476	We aren't listened to by hundreds of thousands of people every week or even tens of thousands or barely a thousand every week.
1250556	1257444	So it's nice that, you know, to be found in our little corner of the internet, our little fam that we have here on Sunday night.
1257524	1261649	And I just, I really appreciate them for doing the homework and finding us.
1262389	1263070	Super appreciate it.
1263190	1263571	I really do.
1265609	1265909	All right.
1266289	1266670	Yay.
1266930	1272073	Well, with that, we can stop talking about ourselves and get back into talking about some video games and gaming news.
1272693	1277596	And well, actually, let me just quickly mention some comments in chat, of course, over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1278277	1279758	S2 and Hunter Matt says, congrats.
1280138	1281859	We from the OL Army are proud of you.
1282199	1285501	We would be here if you guys didn't bring the awesome and bring us joy every week.
1285742	1285942	Oh, 100%.
1286602	1289344	ZenMonkey11 says, no shame in being proud of your work.
1289464	1290705	Thank you for understanding that.
1290765	1291165	Like, again...
1291645	1292306	Thank you for watching!
1310538	1315518	SSJ100Matt says, now if there is ever a Wikipedia entry page, they can't take it down now.
1317119	1319399	Actually, you bring up an excellent point.
1319819	1328061	The old Wikipedia page was pulled because there was no, all the sourcing in it was from like our own pages.
1328681	1332242	You now have a source from Guinness World Record Gamers Edition 2025.
1332402	1333122	What page number, Loki?
1335784	1364457	62 62 that says we're the longest running English language podcast about video games so now you can source something like that's a pretty respectable source I don't know copy and paste that I put in our application I'm putting it in chat I don't know how to make a Wikipedia page and as I understand that would be outside the ethical guidelines anyway since I'm involved with this show but maybe those of you that know a little more about it
1365322	1370468	Go forth and have fun and I would love that if it works.
1372423	1382973	Let's see, Bobby Blackwell pointing out, I'm on episode 907 starting in July 2005, you know, kind of pointing out that he's been running just as long as some of these other shows that are longest running.
1383013	1393163	And Bobby, obviously, a huge part of why we're still on the air to this day, saving us from Life 365 and getting us our former All Games Radio partnership.
1393863	1395865	Really appreciate that as well.
1395985	1396125	So...
1397256	1398957	Thank you, thank you for Bobby.
1398997	1418605	And then I have to, at some point, also say a huge thank you to VXJasonXV because even though his face is not on the wall right now, he was with this show for a very long time in person, but every week without fail, he's putting in the work of doing the intro, doing those bumps, some of the web stuff behind the scene.
1418986	1419866	So Jason,
1420146	1422208	Absolutely shares in this with us as well.
1422328	1423169	Oh, Jason's in chat.
1423189	1423810	Well, you're welcome.
1423830	1424170	There you go.
1424190	1425171	See, I didn't even know you were here.
1425512	1430097	But Jason shares with us in that 100% as well and needs to be called out.
1430197	1432840	So put that on Wikipedia.
1435580	1438922	All right, let's get into... Okay, enough talk about ourselves, I promise.
1439002	1442085	Let's get into talking about some video game news.
1443085	1445207	Loki, pretty big one dropped this week.
1445287	1446408	New console, am I right?
1447188	1450471	Yeah, we kind of knew it was coming because of all the leaks and everything.
1450591	1454594	So the PlayStation 5 Pro has been officially announced.
1456014	1459655	Thanks to a presentation by Mark Cerny.
1460736	1469578	Having you compare the two images sent by corporate that are identical because, you know, they look very close in quality.
1469978	1473039	No, to be fair, the PlayStation 5 Pro does have better graphics.
1475930	1480153	Very small details, but that's been kind of one of the sticking points with it.
1481253	1498403	It has a 67% larger GPU, 28% faster RAM, and renders at 45% faster, as well as improved ray tracing speeds and AI upscaling that they call PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.
1499624	1500204	And it's $700.
1500264	1500404	Yeah.
1503399	1529974	$700 for a digital version $699 US dollars $699 US dollars and that is of course if you want your physical collection to be able to play on it you're going to have to pay $80 to get one of those drives that is if you can get one of the disc drives for it because scalpers are a thing and they have bought the drives so that nobody else can have them um
1531138	1539363	and then of course, you know, $700 or in this case $800 because also the vertical stand's not included as well in case you want it not to tip over easily.
1542264	1550049	The argument is I guess that it's a console that you could sell your old one and then trade it in and it's only $350 then, right?
1551209	1552950	That's not so bad, right?
1554951	1559094	That's if it's in good condition and you get all the money and all that good stuff, but yes.
1559793	1565337	Yeah, I personally will not be jumping to get one of these because I don't see the point, and it's expensive.
1565517	1566237	Yeah.
1566658	1569439	They also raised the controller prices too, I believe, recently.
1569920	1571080	So there's that as well.
1571881	1574583	A whole bunch of price gouging.
1576027	1584789	Yeah, I think this is going to go over about as well as the original announcement of the PlayStation 3 when Sony really took it on the chin.
1584849	1592851	Now, granted, there's a huge difference here, and that is that Microsoft came out the very next day and basically was like, our system's going to be $100 cheaper.
1592871	1593812	Maybe it was the other way around.
1593852	1594352	I can't remember.
1594372	1595352	It was a long time ago, but...
1595712	1597134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1611331	1630665	but if there's there's a lot that's different now and even looking at the PlayStation 4 Pro because I posted my own distaste about you know this and the fact that I really think this is too expensive and I had a rando reply to me on Blue Sky basically saying I don't see the difference between this and what they did with the PS4 Pro and I'm like
1631496	1648585	Pro or Sib, like this is actually a huge difference because when the PlayStation 4 Pro came out, it was the exact same price that the PlayStation 4 was originally introduced at, which I believe was $399, $499 at the time.
1648646	1654709	Sorry, my memory is vague, but I know it was the exact same price as the PlayStation 4 when it first came out.
1655009	1656430	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1672282	1677204	You might start looking at, can I get a gaming PC or a gaming rig?
1677704	1682186	Because a lot of Sony's exclusive games are also on PC at this point.
1682226	1686248	Yeah, and they're still committed to putting out stuff on PC as well.
1687749	1700074	And then on top of that, going back to the PlayStation 4 Pro... Well, I just want to quickly say before somebody corrects me, I understand a super-duper graphics card is going to be very expensive, but still, I think perception...
1700794	1704436	is always going to be more important than the truth in this industry.
1704997	1706778	That's a hard fact, hard pill to swallow.
1707258	1710860	And the perception of the $700 price tag right now is it doesn't buy you much.
1711041	1711441	Sorry, Loki.
1712403	1734073	Yeah, I was gonna say like the the jump from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 4 Pro was a bit more significant like especially when we're talking like VR and stuff they would really enhance you know what can be done with PlayStation VR like the resolution was much higher there was a lot of other nice features to go along with that you know smoother gameplay and stuff
1734713	1742495	What they showed, like the comparison screenshots that they showed or gameplay videos, they had to zoom way in on the background.
1742575	1745756	It's like, yeah, see this thing way in the distance over there?
1745776	1747456	Yeah, it's slightly more sharp now.
1749217	1751057	That's not night and day different.
1751477	1752978	It really isn't.
1753338	1762140	And maybe there'll be more games that support that later on, or maybe they'll just have specific games that only play on the PlayStation 5 Pro, but...
1763917	1765778	It's not really making the argument as well.
1765799	1770722	I don't recall, and I could be wrong, and if somebody wants to fact check me in real time, fine.
1771303	1775966	I don't recall there ever being a PlayStation 4 Pro only game.
1776707	1784012	I think some people are thinking about new 3DS, and that was a thing, but that was a very different can of worms.
1784873	1788235	I don't believe there was ever a game that would only run on PlayStation 4 Pro.
1789707	1804796	and I think Sony had said that is that they kind of mandated it had to run on the base PS4 even if crappy which I think is what happened with Cyberpunk so yeah I mean like it's
1805916	1808957	They certainly had, like... I just think the performance was better.
1809017	1821961	Like, the jump in performance with games was much more significant because we were talking... It was... I mean, there was still 4K gaming, I think, but it wasn't as, like... It was a little bit more...
1823568	1850376	Noticeable, like you had games go from 30 to 60 FPS and you had, you know, a lot more detail in there and some of these more performance modes and stuff but just with this, just from what they even showed, like the argument that they're trying to make on some of these older games, it's like, yeah it looks slightly better, but like it's not that much better, it's not like we're talking, going from something looking very basic to just like holy cow, this is retrace the hell and
1851016	1879486	it's just the most amazing looking graphics I've ever seen it's not that at all it could be something later on in the future that you may have more of these enhancements and stuff and it's also something where they have that performance mode and they have the high fidelity mode and now with the Pro you get the best of both worlds with that but it just hasn't sold me on it it's very expensive and the performance upgrade
1881363	1882907	What they demonstrated was not enough.
1886009	1890850	I think this item, you know, I'm not saying there's not a place for it.
1890990	1894211	I think it will end up being very much a boutique kind of item.
1894771	1897852	I think this thing ends up being a high collectible value.
1897912	1900132	I think this really does become a collector's item.
1900292	1909154	I think in a few years, people who had a PS5 Pro, it's going to be like, ooh, that was kind of like the niche one that ran things a little better.
1909254	1909955	Like, oh, interesting.
1910015	1911235	I think when we kind of look back,
1911975	1930900	I think the collectability of this thing is going to be pretty good I don't think that sells a lot of units at the end of the day and I'm just trying to be fair like some of you might be rolling your eyes at what I'm saying but I think realistically with the high price tag it becomes like a high-end car it's like oh okay fancy but you can't drive it but my Prius gets better gas mileage
1931320	1932781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1952079	1958845	who actually said, now if Nintendo wants to put Switch 2 out for $399, that would be closer to the realm of possibility.
1958905	1967792	You know, and a moment ago I mentioned one big difference between this and the PlayStation 3 price tag I compared this to is that you don't have Microsoft coming out the next day.
1967832	1973076	And I don't see Microsoft kind of changing their Series X and Series S type of thing.
1973136	1974998	Series X is not a PS5 Pro.
1975438	1976399	It's a PS5.
1976799	1978580	Series S is actually under...
1979341	1979902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2007225	2015393	and do that first unveiling of the Switch 2, which to be fair, would be in line with how the Switch was unveiled.
2015933	2025101	There was like a two minute commercial that came out in like October the year before that basically showed the Switch concept.
2025121	2027644	Remember the people playing on the rooftop and all that shit?
2027664	2029345	I thought that was like January.
2029645	2031107	No, it was the year before.
2031627	2035888	that they showed it very quickly and then January was the deep dive.
2036388	2045589	That was the full press announcement with all the pomp and circumstance, the full launch lineup, the date, the price, all that stuff.
2046470	2059952	So it's very possible Nintendo in the next couple weeks comes out and shows an early concept and I think that still could take the thunder from this thing a little bit.
2061521	2066010	I'm not sure there's a lot of oomph behind this anyway.
2066170	2067853	Again, I think your...
2070585	2096782	I almost want to say well-to-do or at least people with a high gaming budget let's say people with a high gaming budget friends that want this as a collectability that's going to be who gets this and I don't really think a Switch 2 announcement cuts into that too much but it could be very interesting I think from a talk of the town type of thing I think once that Switch 2 commercial hits nobody's talking about PS5 Pro anymore nobody
2099113	2100313	So we'll see.
2100453	2100893	We'll see.
2101554	2106795	Bobby is remembering a time when Loki said that commercial showed hardware that was not possible.
2107415	2108855	I don't remember saying that.
2108875	2115097	Bobby says, to be fair, I also thought it was exaggerating how quickly it would go from handheld to docked.
2115137	2117677	I think we all kind of thought that at the beginning.
2117917	2119958	Oh, they're souping this up for the commercial.
2120038	2121718	It's not going to switch over that fast.
2121758	2123979	And then, well, shit, it did.
2123999	2124359	Yeah.
2124759	2126380	It's pretty fucking fast, actually.
2126840	2132504	So it will be interesting to see what happens when and if the Switch 2 is unveiled.
2132884	2137747	But as far as the PlayStation 5 Pro, props to you if you can afford one.
2137847	2138688	I'm not going to hate on it.
2138728	2141470	You're going to have a nice little collector's item, I think, if you can afford one.
2141870	2142891	Me, I'm going to pass.
2145332	2145592	All right.
2146253	2147594	If that's it on the PS5 Pro,
2149093	2154295	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2154615	2155616	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
2155656	2156296	How was your gaming week?
2158077	2158717	Kind of annoying.
2160378	2161658	I did play some Dead by Daylight.
2161718	2162999	I haven't played the new mode yet.
2163099	2164599	I'm going to do that tonight after the show.
2167455	2196441	but I tried to start the casting of Frank Stone and my game would just go black and not let me past anything every time I had to do this one part where you deck the titular character in the face that's without spoiling much about the game so I went to log back in today to see if I could check up on that and when I hit continue it darted me over from the beginning
2198069	2226794	so needless to say I'm a little bit frustrated by that that's annoying and don't forget people playing DBD if you put in blood pint one word in the store you will redeem 500,000 blood points and of course for those of us who got the pre-order bonuses though for that game that was 2 million blood points they gave out it was pretty epic um
2228928	2251384	and then um I played Simpalia and that's really about it just because I had so much going on um because we had Fuck It Friday um which was of course at my house and we decided to be terrible human beings and break out the bigger blacker box and uh
2253617	2270568	the things we found super objectionable we just like put them somewhere else and backed them away and said we weren't touching them and I did something else oh yeah I saw Beetlejuice Beetlejuice last night was that a good time?
2272481	2296736	um yeah it was really good it was quite the worthy sequel but I wanted the they had like these like promotional uh lowball glasses as they called them but they ran out so I just basically drank um not just one espresso margarita not margarita but espresso martini but he said drink some down there's some left in the container
2298590	2326774	and I just saw him pour Grey Goose for a while and I'm like, oh lord I'm either gonna pass out or have to pee or just be really hyper the latter two happened the movie was really good, I very much enjoyed it there's nothing after the credits it was very worthy and I'm pretty sure the door is open for a tertiary entry into it
2329728	2341195	but I really enjoyed it that ending was well paced and very good I thought that they did it just right so
2346010	2348991	It also reminds me just how weird the lyrics of MacArthur Park are.
2350812	2360477	And I went back, though, and was just playing Jackie Crush and Devil's Crush and just a few little teeny things on my own.
2360497	2361577	But I...
2363823	2369067	I've been low on bandwidth all week with getting ready for TwitchCon, so yeah.
2370048	2370309	Alright.
2371329	2376554	And PodCulture, I normally do not play Cards Against Humanity because of practices within the company.
2376614	2383860	I no longer give them any business, but I already had the box, so it is what it is.
2385041	2386182	Alright, let's move on to Loki.
2386242	2387123	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2388571	2390833	My gaming week was mostly Minecraft.
2391713	2396957	Occasionally, I've been playing some of the Discord games.
2397217	2411046	My co-hosts, or not co-hosts, are one of the fellow cast members to have me try this Zynga game called Farmerge Valley that's just a brain-dead gacha game.
2411106	2411507	I don't know.
2411707	2414048	It's just pretty brain-dead, but...
2415230	2415470	Uh-oh.
2415550	2416870	We have another ferret.
2444758	2446919	Oh, you found one of those old ass fair.
2446999	2447259	Okay.
2447899	2450380	I had to perform surgery to get the batteries replaced.
2450501	2450761	Okay.
2450941	2451921	Oh my God.
2452601	2455342	Because of the world record thing, we may have some new listeners this week.
2455442	2459064	So we used to have this mascot, this little stuffed fair.
2459084	2460284	Can you hold it up for the camera, Loki?
2460304	2461225	So at least the live listeners.
2461305	2463886	And it's actually in the book.
2464921	2465842	Oh, that's right.
2465902	2468583	They took that part of the clip art, didn't they?
2469204	2469504	Yeah.
2470385	2472306	Well, it's all pixel art that I made.
2472506	2473026	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2473406	2484233	So we used to have this little stuffed ferret, called a scoozie, that would make these dumb little noises that Jamie used to love and cling to during the old episodes of OLR.
2484253	2487816	And the ferret was kind of like the mascot of OLR, which is why...
2488396	2488836	They did, yeah.
2513099	2521066	and it's annoying they have like battery boxes inside of them but there's no way to open them up so I had to kind of perform surgery to get the batteries replaced.
2521226	2523127	DarkTutsu asked, does it make the noise?
2523187	2525249	It sounds like it does but it's just not coming through your mic right now.
2525269	2525669	It does.
2525990	2527011	It does make noise.
2527111	2532335	I'll try to like see if I can pick it up if I'm talking while doing it.
2532615	2537059	It sounds all robot-y like audio compression or something.
2537579	2539040	It's like, that's outside noise.
2539260	2540882	Gotta suppress it.
2541642	2542383	Yeah, it
2543946	2568420	yeah it'll keep filtering it out unfortunately all right well that's that's awesome all right any anything else for your gaming week uh no that's just it um yeah like I said I've got well TwitchCon this week so there's lots of Minecraft related things I'll be doing uh this week and networking and stuff so that'll be fun um I just put up put an episode out today so yeah nice
2570054	2571275	And happy belated birthday.
2571315	2572736	Your birthday was this past week.
2573216	2576319	And I know we all gave you shouts on social media and in the Discord and all that.
2576459	2581502	But remember, the best birthday present you could give Loki is get someone to subscribe to his YouTube channel.
2581522	2582223	Watch time.
2582463	2583544	Watch time would be nice.
2583644	2586766	Because my watch time, it's year to year and it keeps going down.
2587146	2587707	I don't know.
2587907	2589368	I have like a few thousand followers.
2592070	2593370	The episodes just don't get watched.
2593510	2603255	I don't know if it's a bunch of bots that sub to my channel or something, but it's... Well, if you want to get Loki a present, then have one of his videos on in the background while you cook dinner.
2603295	2607196	Or you should watch it, but short of that, have it on while you cook dinner.
2607216	2613519	I'm not going to say watch it illegally or bought it, but just watch it while you're multitasking.
2613639	2613980	It's great.
2615600	2616421	You can put it on loop.
2617781	2618762	I just did a thing.
2620611	2622712	Did you buy one of these things off eBay or something?
2623913	2625474	There was one on Macari for $11.
2626114	2627574	Oh, that's not so bad.
2627694	2628175	That's not so bad.
2628195	2628875	$11 is good.
2628955	2632196	Yeah, this was only like, it was less than $10, I think.
2633997	2634277	Alright.
2634297	2637439	They had one of the original, like, bigger ones for like $30.
2639244	2641485	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2662738	2678702	um but I think even those I think those had like battery box like velcro battery boxes and stuff that you could do like this is sewn in which is annoying because I had to cut it open to get to the the box to replace the watch batteries in there that were super old um but yeah
2679855	2691221	Speaking of the OLR old throwback days, since we're really reminiscing this week, do you know who I kind of actually... So I posted the world record thing on Facebook, and I got to say, I was not expecting the response I got.
2691341	2695943	I think more people liked the world record thing on my Facebook than liked the post when I got married.
2696683	2699505	But it is what it is.
2699645	2700565	It's the algorithm.
2700665	2702006	Either it's going to get you or it's not.
2702546	2729906	and one of the people who reached out out of the blue who I hadn't heard from in quite some time was Darkchild who I don't know if you remember but him and Janae I can't remember if Janae used a stage name or not so sorry if I'm I'm doxing her but Janae and Darkchild were in the studio when Matt and I lived together so this would have been like the really early seasons of OLR when it was you know live probably pre-podcast time actually and
2731087	2734750	Darkchild reached out to me and was like, hey, I heard about the world record.
2735090	2735950	Congratulations.
2736091	2736711	We should catch up.
2736751	2737371	It's been forever.
2737872	2742275	I just realized if it wasn't for OLR, Janae and I would have never met.
2742375	2745377	I don't know if you all know him and Janae are married now and have a kid.
2746238	2773448	and they met because of OLR and being in the studio together all those years ago so that was really cool to hear from him out of the blue so shout out if you're out there Dark Child and Janae of course so miss I um unfortunately you don't really do the in-person thing anymore but I would I would love to even just have you on over discord just to just to catch up all these years later that would be such a fun I don't know if it would be a good Sunday night show but maybe like a spin-off thing at VOG Network like reach out to some of these people
2774008	2775430	We haven't heard from him forever.
2775830	2776871	Like those two.
2777432	2779534	Puppy comes to mind.
2779635	2780776	I know he's still around.
2780856	2784120	You know he does like Star Wars lightsaber battle shit that's like really intense.
2784180	2785261	It really looks cool.
2785401	2786542	I follow him on Instagram.
2786923	2787564	He's still around.
2787964	2789306	Who else from back in those days?
2789386	2790026	Princess Irene.
2790167	2791208	I could get a hold of her pretty easy.
2792189	2792830	She's still around.
2794871	2798153	Some people, unfortunately, I don't talk to anymore, such as Life.
2798513	2800694	So I can't promise everybody from back in the day.
2801194	2804336	But the Mels, the Mels would always be happy to pop on and say hello.
2804476	2807077	So I think it might be fun to come back.
2807117	2808058	Oh, DDR Angel.
2808378	2809298	Excellent.
2809678	2812380	DDR Angel is now Tech Angel and she streams.
2812620	2814320	So she's very easy to find.
2814581	2815041	So yeah.
2816886	2818408	VAMPIRE SURVIVORS
2835046	2841268	because it's only five bucks and hey, I can grind for trophies and I really love Vampire Survivors.
2841388	2848030	It's such a great, fun, mindless game that, you know, suddenly, oops, it's two hours later.
2848150	2849050	What have I been doing?
2849170	2850770	I've been playing Vampire Survivors.
2851130	2852451	So that was really fun to get.
2852571	2855071	I also picked up a game just based on word of mouth.
2855452	2858212	It was a pretty reasonable price and people seemed to really like this game.
2858252	2860093	So I was really curious, like, would I be into this game?
2860533	2861153	So I bought a game.
2861173	2863894	I don't know if I'm going to pronounce this right, but it's called Bellatro.
2864114	2864354	I think
2864614	2865374	is the name of the game.
2865394	2866415	It's that card game.
2866455	2867115	Yeah, you got it.
2867215	2874098	It's the card game that sort of has they call roguelike elements into it because there's some deck building type of mechanics that are in it.
2875299	2890005	And basically the whole concept is around these different jokers that do these different effects on how you total your hand at the end because the whole like totaling of the hand feels very similar to like cribbage, which is an old game I really like.
2890106	2891566	So that's kind of interesting.
2891626	2892667	I haven't played it in forever.
2892727	2893207	Yeah, yeah.
2893587	2919057	so I think Bellatro is interesting I'm not sure it's grabbing me as much as I thought it would because let's be real this is a game they could have done on like Windows 3.1 like this is more of a reflection of like the popularity of roguelikes and casual games and those sorts of things there's nothing about this game why it needs to be on PS5 and PC which is fine a good game is a good game
2919557	2924519	But then I was kind of really expecting to be like drawn in and sucked in by the gameplay.
2925059	2927020	I have to admit, I'm kind of not.
2927640	2929581	I can see where it's addicting for some people.
2929741	2932182	I'm just not sure it's addicting for me, to be quite honest.
2932842	2933743	And that's okay.
2933783	2934923	It doesn't mean it's a bad game.
2935063	2937324	I just think like I played it for a little bit.
2937364	2941106	I'm like, I'm not sure I understand the strategy here.
2941546	2944067	Like the tutorial really just cuts off at some point.
2944127	2946968	And I was like, I'm not sure what I should be doing.
2947048	2948969	Like I keep winning these hands.
2949689	2973885	and I'm not sure I understand all of these mechanics and some might say that's part of the experience is learning all that shit but I don't know I feel like I needed just a little more like move me in the right direction so I really understand if I'm playing this game well or what I need to be doing better that was the only thing that kind of got me about it but otherwise I mean it's pretty cheap so it's pretty hard to go wrong at the price it's at
2974864	2976145	And then the other game I played this week.
2976666	2982772	So happy anniversary to the Dreamcast, which turned 25 this last week.
2982812	2984614	I think we mentioned at the end of last week's show.
2985935	2993323	And I was able to... I went to one of my friends on Monday who got out the Dreamcast and we fucking played Power Stone.
2994103	2994804	And boy...
2995845	2997326	Boy, am I bad at Power Stone.
2997906	2999547	But I'm not bad at Crazy Taxi.
2999607	3001789	I actually played that for a little bit, and that was fun.
3002449	3006712	And then on Friday, I went out to the local Daddy Bar.
3007132	3008093	I call it the Daddy Bar.
3008393	3008893	It's the Bolt.
3009033	3009894	Jamie, you know that place.
3010394	3014417	So I went out to the Bolt because they have Gamer Night with a Y. G-A-Y-M-E-R Night.
3015197	3016018	My friend rents that.
3016698	3019620	Okay, every second Friday is when that is.
3020301	3021181	Do I know your friend?
3021241	3021862	I probably do.
3022702	3022842	Unite
3041098	3055013	I got my fucking ass destroyed and get your mind out of the gutter because we're not talking about the bolt in this sentence I'm talking about Marvel vs. Capcom 2 I got destroyed they do have that swing in there you know
3057368	3058689	We're not talking about that.
3059029	3063650	We're talking about good old-fashioned video games, which I was terrible at.
3063870	3065731	I did not realize how bad I was.
3066711	3067811	We did play, though.
3068152	3069552	Did you get taken for a ride?
3069872	3072273	Yeah, out on the patio.
3072333	3072793	Yes, I did.
3073193	3077454	No, I did not leave it at home, but no, I got wrecked.
3078735	3081796	But earlier in the week, again on Dreamcast night, I played...
3083496	3107058	it wasn't Dreamcast but there was also just Steam Deck going around so I played SNK versus Capcom because they just released that not that long ago on Steam and so and my friend was like oh you actually are pretty you're pretty decent at this one because I'm bad a lot but that one has Mai and I love Mai and when I started playing as Mai I was actually winning and he was like oh you're you're pretty decent at this one I was like yes because I can play as Mai
3109434	3110614	So, alright.
3110694	3111915	Anyway, that was my gaming week.
3112255	3113115	I hope y'all are proud of me.
3113155	3115396	I played quite a few games besides just Final Fantasy XIV.
3115876	3122638	Alright, let's get into some gaming news and some things that are going on in the gaming world, which there's a lot to talk about again this week.
3123158	3124338	Loki's gonna start us off.
3124418	3124738	Loki.
3125879	3126859	Flappy Bird!
3128519	3129960	Yeah, we're talking about Flappy Bird.
3130060	3131900	It's 2013 all over again.
3131920	3132880	What year is it?
3134161	3137822	Flappy Bird is coming back to mobile storefronts and web browsers.
3138757	3140058	It's coming out next year.
3164616	3169019	Oh, are you saying Don Nguyen's finally getting his coin all these years later off this?
3169139	3171941	Oh, I guess we should be happy for it, shouldn't we?
3187617	3189920	and then what else did they also probably get in there?
3190061	3191563	Oh, did we say NFTs?
3191603	3203079	Because that's what makes all good games nowadays is if it has NFTs in it and that's what they're doing is they're bringing NFTs into Flappy Bird.
3206617	3226329	needless flappy tokens I do like how they're being the company is being harassed on social media by some journalists which I thought was funny they keep asking them questions about it so everything I'm saying about Don Nguyen the original creator is very tongue-in-cheek because y'all know what happened here right
3227338	3235404	Unfortunately, trademark law has a thing where if you don't use something for so long, you have effectively abandoned it.
3235504	3244030	Hence, why Nintendo always fights all of their IPs, even when they frustratingly are not making new games in them.
3244511	3244791	Zero.
3246294	3268209	but that's why they'll put an F-Zero download content thing into Mario Kart because that renews the timer on their trademark so that nobody else can just swoop in and get that trademark and Don Nguyen has actually come out and said no I have no relation with their game I did not sell anything also I don't support crypto um
3269886	3274148	He never re-upped the trademark, which led to it being acquired by another company.
3274188	3277529	The game is tied to Web3, likely has microtransactions.
3281171	3283812	So in other words, fuck all of this.
3285453	3287816	is basically... Maybe that's opinion, but fine.
3288217	3289418	Fuck all of this.
3289899	3296487	Because they literally stole... I mean, yeah, it's legal, but let's be real.
3297248	3299651	So much with trademark and copyright.
3299711	3301273	These laws in this country...
3301773	3315764	were built long before the internet and goddamn do they need some modernization because another excellent example of where trademark laws are doing people fucking dirty is with, I'm sure you all know Jules from TikTok.
3316104	3322309	Even if you don't watch TikTok, you've probably heard the phrase, very demure, very mindful, very cutesy.
3322589	3326131	Well, that was a trans woman of color that started that trend.
3326452	3327132	And guess what?
3327232	3330795	As soon as that whole very demure, very mindful caught on,
3331275	3340844	Some other little troll, trademarked, very demure, very mindful, so that they could put it on a t-shirt and make all the money.
3340984	3354236	Now, I believe, thankfully, some pro bono folks are helping Jules out, and I think she... I haven't caught the latest on the drama, but I think last I heard, quotey, it's all been worked out, which means...
3355219	3383125	they sent hefty letters to these individuals that were trademarking basically saying we're going to sue the fuck out of you if you don't let this go and so they let it go and I don't know if you heard but however you feel about that phrase and however you feel about that trend she is getting the surgeries that she wanted paid for thanks to the TikTok revenue so hey I would much rather she be making some coin
3384025	3389990	and some of the people that are making coin on another popular social media site but I'm not going to go there because I promise to be nice today.
3390871	3391111	Yeah.
3392052	3393593	I love Patrick Klepek.
3395074	3396295	They just sing so great.
3396556	3404102	They keep responding to all the posts by the Flappy Bird account saying, I'm ready for the answer to what your relationship is with the original creator of this game.
3404562	3405503	Who made this game?
3406604	3407565	Where'd you get the IP?
3408225	3409947	Why aren't you answering any questions?
3410487	3410787	Mm-hmm.
3413507	3414208	Exactly.
3414628	3415229	Exactly.
3416089	3419172	So anyway, hope you flop.
3419292	3421234	Hope it's floppy bird, quite honestly.
3421394	3424056	So that will be the last we'll be talking about this game on this show.
3424516	3426778	But it is a tough lesson learned.
3427118	3432783	So let this be a warning to all of you if you're going to start making games, Loki.
3433999	3446670	If you want to still make money off those games 10 years later, if your game goes viral, so I'm sorry, Loki, maybe you don't need to worry about this, but if your game goes viral and somebody else wants to make coin off of it, you better renew them trademarks.
3447951	3454757	And boy, do we need some people in the trademark, patent, copyright offices, legal stuff in this country.
3454777	3459441	Boy, we need some people at the helm that understand the internet and how the internet has changed the entire fucking game.
3460492	3484063	so because we need some modernization in these laws if Mickey Mouse can stay untouched for 95 years can't can't this world be free of Flappy Bird for another 95 years 85 whatever anyway go buy Don Nguyen a coffee Bobby's saying it's because he stopped selling on the store which makes sense
3484568	3489590	Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, he pulled, yeah, I mean, it's, what, here's the thing.
3489950	3494251	What these guys, these NFT companies, what they're doing is not illegal.
3494911	3497512	In fact, some would say it's smart.
3498432	3506975	But we can all look at this and look under the layer of how they got to where they're at and where that money is actually going.
3507215	3514217	We can say, you can look at it and go, it was a well-played capitalist move, but you can look at that and go, and it's fucking shitty.
3515014	3521096	Well, it's immoral, so I mean, yeah, it's legal, but you're... Who cares about morals when there's money to be made?
3521116	3526637	Yeah, it's, you know, it's just like the quote, it's like, you know, you're not wrong, you're just an asshole.
3526837	3528838	Let's go back to what we said at the top of the show.
3528998	3532139	It's not the facts that matter, it's perception.
3532939	3538921	And all of this shit that's coming out about how Flappy Bird is getting rebooted, not a good perception.
3540723	3542724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3562222	3563483	Oh no, look at this, look at this, look at this.
3564144	3569829	Flappy Bird, still in my library with the little icon to download it.
3570149	3571010	Although it wouldn't do shit.
3571050	3574693	Again, it's not going to run on this phone because of the whole Apple changed those rules a few years ago.
3574793	3578717	But at least I can say that's my little piece of gaming history.
3579697	3580078	There you go.
3581289	3586870	Bobby is also saying, I bet this new company will absolutely go after people who made Flappy Bird clones.
3587050	3587910	Oh, yes, they will.
3588751	3589691	Oh, yes, they will.
3589731	3598813	If you made a Flappy Bird clone, you better delist that shit fast or you better call it Flappy Pow World because apparently that makes you invulnerable to these types of lawsuits.
3599193	3602553	Don't you know you just have to add guns to things and everything is legal?
3602594	3604654	Give the bird a gun and you'll be fine.
3606547	3607587	Have you seen that game?
3608548	3614611	The new one that's kind of along the lines of Palworld.
3614751	3616391	It's called Long Winter.
3618152	3619633	It's basically Animal Crossing.
3619893	3621113	Is it the same company?
3623172	3632017	It's not the same company, but it's another company that took... I mean, you look at the article... But this is two years ago.
3632097	3633278	This isn't exactly new.
3633538	3633838	All right.
3633958	3637800	Well, it's not new, but like... I'm reacting live to this on Eris.
3637860	3642263	I'm playing the video for folks on our... Oops, I gotta show the right screen, don't I?
3642443	3643884	On our other screen here.
3643984	3645405	Let's fast forward to this here.
3646185	3646605	Okay.
3647566	3650688	That character, like, isn't even legally distinct.
3650708	3650908	Yeah.
3651708	3668645	like that that is a fucking Animal Crossing character I'm sorry that we're seeing here on the screen let me uh let me fast forward a little further into what's going on here I mean I mean the game itself looks different yeah the game does look different like certainly not as good
3670366	3671046	Interesting.
3671767	3672687	Huh.
3672767	3673628	Alright, Nintendo.
3673868	3676029	So tell me, so they have guns?
3676529	3677229	Are they fracking?
3677289	3678610	Is it the fracking?
3678670	3681571	It's a survival game and you have guns as well.
3682032	3684653	Because it looks like with all these rigs and things, this is fracking.
3684793	3685713	It's animal fracking.
3686754	3687574	Animal fracking?
3689395	3690676	Tom Nook strikes again.
3694718	3695498	I don't know.
3695518	3698680	But yeah, even the interface, you look at the interface and the interface looks the same too.
3699240	3699420	Yeah.
3700791	3701912	All right, let's move on.
3702612	3705953	Unfortunately, I don't have good news to follow this up with.
3706013	3707614	We go from one shitty thing to another.
3708214	3712376	And unfortunately, on this story, we're going to be talking about layoffs.
3712476	3716158	Unfortunately, Microsoft has conducted more layoffs this week.
3716558	3717738	They laid off 650 people this week.
3719679	3721320	from the Xbox Gaming Division.
3721380	3736272	This was announced in a company-wide memo that Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer sent and is also stressed as a part of this, no new games were being canceled or studios closed as a result of the latest round of cuts.
3737013	3741697	This... Meaning people are going to be overworked and understaffed.
3743194	3743895	Here's the thing.
3744155	3748418	I have tried so hard over the years to really stick up for Phil Spencer.
3749038	3751280	You're making it really fucking hard this year, Phil.
3751380	3754082	Ever since this Activision acquisition.
3754423	3760727	Which, hey, I will say, you got Bobby Kotech out of the industry.
3761048	3762769	That's his new name, Bobby Kotech.
3762889	3764390	You got him out of the industry.
3764470	3765111	Congrats.
3765751	3773039	The amount of money that he was given as a golden parachute probably could have paid the salaries for these people for another four years.
3773460	3775042	Boo his tomato.
3775682	3775923	That...
3777059	3779080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3807150	3808753	how am I supposed to celebrate that?
3810335	3810676	I can't
3816125	3818066	I guess I could read the rest of the comment here.
3818206	3828511	I guess in the interest of lighting up all sides, I guess I could say that Phil Spencer said the 650 rolls cut were, quote, mostly corporate and supporting functions.
3829131	3838696	Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.
3839256	3844819	No games, devices, or experiences are being canceled and new studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.
3845520	3847848	which as we know was different from when there was 1,900 layoffs.
3853041	3854541	Maybe this one stings a little more.
3854621	3856302	I'm going to be completely transparent here.
3856502	3861283	I don't know how much I want to talk about this because this isn't my business and this isn't my thing to complain about.
3861703	3866624	However, in this particular circumstance, I happen to know somebody that was affected by this.
3867224	3879946	So I'm feeling a little bit extra jumpy on this or I feel a little extra snippy on this news because I've seen it personally affect somebody who says they will be fine and they are taking it personally.
3880126	3880687	What can you do?
3880707	3881347	What can you do?
3911553	3918682	Anyway, something to think about when it's time to re-up your Game Pass subscription for the increased fee they're going to be charging this year.
3918902	3920243	Just putting that out there.
3920263	3921645	Good thing I never got one to begin with.
3922005	3922726	Something to think about.
3923768	3924308	Let's move on.
3924368	3924769	DarkSakura.
3926522	3951552	yeah so um it looks like that um oh gosh I hate when they put up these pop-ups okay so um Evercade is adding uh analog controller support in their latest update I don't have one of these it would be nice um but at any rate um
3953317	3955958	It's for the Evercade VS, I believe.
3956358	3956598	Yeah.
3957078	3959519	It looks kind of like reverse Super Famicom colors.
3961440	3967402	But yeah, you can play your games that require a little bit more third dimensional activity.
3968503	3969403	People have asked for it.
3969743	3970183	It's on there.
3973530	3989098	Some of the games that have listed that will support it is Worms Armageddon, Speedball 2100, 40 Winks, Duke Nukem Last of the Babes, Duke Nukem Time to Kill, Glover, Tomb Raider 3, Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver.
3991199	3994641	And they're also adding a cartridge eject feature.
3996846	3998746	I actually have the Evercade.
3999107	4002607	I think it's Evercade Versus because it was the first one that has two players.
4004128	4006108	I don't know about them very well.
4006188	4007568	That's actually what I have.
4007648	4012329	And I will say the controller's kind of the weakest part of this system.
4013270	4016170	So this is kind of interesting that they're going to be adding this.
4016470	4018671	Does this mean I can just pop in a PS5 controller?
4018691	4019831	Because that would actually be rad.
4020191	4020691	Oh, here it is.
4021492	4023072	Xbox, PlayStation, 8-bit, Dewpads.
4023152	4023392	Okay.
4023512	4023592	Okay.
4023752	4025013	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4043732	4053161	Yep, so this makes sense that we're now seeing Sony removing Concord from players' accounts because, well, they did the whole mass refund on it.
4053241	4057004	You're obviously not going to get to keep a launcher for a game that doesn't exist anymore.
4057965	4066272	So now, yeah, late last week, they pulled down the servers and everything and they have removed it from the accounts.
4066372	4069715	And of course, this is while they determine their best path ahead.
4070776	4092900	and they've refunded everybody at least they're supposed to be refunding everyone PlayStation I think the Sony stuff was taking like a couple weeks but like PC they've already done all that so let's we'll have to wait and see what happens Concord is still going to be part of that series that Amazon has coming out in December so that's going to be interesting
4093446	4098948	I think we still see some sort of free-to-play version come out at some point as like a PlayStation Plus.
4099208	4100449	Yeah.
4100949	4108812	But that's... It's one of those things where it's like, yeah, it's kind of shitty that they're pulling it from people's accounts.
4110193	4111653	It reminds me of the whole PT.
4112154	4114495	But at the same time, they gave you your money back.
4114515	4114955	You can't play it.
4116756	4141715	and they did give you the money back so it's like it feels a little less shitty I think it more stings in game preservation and that whole thing which you know we've kind of already talked about with this game that it you know it is a bit of a bummer that you will never be able to play this game as it was again but I also think you know if we cared that much shouldn't we have supported it when it first came out well but there but I was the game had its fans
4142776	4143336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4159997	4162079	But until we know, we don't know.
4162460	4165683	So an E3VL points out PT, you can at least play it.
4166003	4169887	And Shayla, hi there, says PT, that one scary game I'm thinking of.
4170207	4174732	Yes, that was the infamous trailer for Silent Hills, which never happened.
4175353	4176754	Speaking of games that got canceled.
4177135	4179897	But that was probably one of the most infamous demos of all time.
4180098	4180278	Yeah.
4180658	4195807	but also free so when they pulled it you can't exactly be pissed off because I paid for that no you didn't well I mean yeah I would still understand being angry it's the preservation standpoint like I fucking like that and I'd like to be able to play it again someday
4196587	4197849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4215270	4230941	This whole thing where now because of that, we can allow the corporate gremlins literally to come in in the middle of the night and take something off of my console, which has been happening ever since the PlayStation 3 days and the other OS thing that happened.
4230961	4231421	Remember that?
4231981	4232662	Oh, yeah.
4232762	4235584	So now that we are always online, the corporate...
4236144	4257126	the corporate gremlins can come in in the middle of the night and take shit off of our consoles and that shit sucks that's the price we're paying for this convenience and this is why some people and yes it is a minority at this point but why some people are still clinging to physical media and you know because the physical I mean if you have Concord on disc
4258783	4276766	you have some it won't do much but you have something and now this is now the challenge to every hacker and home brewer working in a PlayStation 5 environment out there get Conker to work with the disc if you're the home brewer that figures that out they're gonna write ballads with your name
4280034	4281899	Alright, let's move on.
4282801	4286411	This is one of those stories that's like, what?
4286812	4287534	Literally what?
4290177	4294340	Annapurna Interactive, who actually publishes a lot of games.
4294900	4296662	And I want to make sure we're very clear.
4296742	4297822	They are a publisher.
4298303	4299304	They are not a creator.
4299984	4309811	So even though they have been behind some very big games that have been released over the years, things like Alan Wake, Control, some of those reasons, there's a lot of indie games they're behind.
4310471	4311872	Annapurna publishes these games.
4313434	4319438	It's going to be interesting to see what happens moving forward with these games because the entire staff resigned.
4320598	4336332	and this was the entire staff resigned yeah that's like trippy first off what a fucking power play like kudos honestly as weird as it is to be talking about this whole thing like that is the the
4337421	4342327	The chutzpah, I think the word would be to pull a move like that.
4342347	4342768	No, no, no.
4343328	4344009	Chutzpah.
4344370	4344730	Fine.
4345091	4345992	But you know what I mean.
4346192	4347654	Did the point come across or did it not?
4348195	4350618	It was just an excuse for me to make the ch sound.
4351499	4354462	Y'all had to do that is pretty impressive.
4355023	4356984	Anyway, let me get to the rest of what really happened here.
4357465	4369714	So the staff resigned following a dispute with the owner Megan Ellison, which again, I have also learned something this week, that she is the daughter of Oracle's Larry Ellison?
4369974	4370534	Is that his name?
4371175	4373616	So I did not realize there was a connection there.
4373697	4373977	Who knew?
4375186	4377629	So dickliness runs in the family?
4380171	4381413	I don't know if I'd phrase it that way.
4384956	4396928	So Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and the rest of the team were negotiating with Megan Ellison to spit off the division, publishing the video games, into an independent entity.
4397549	4400172	Megan Ellison backed out of those negotiations.
4400733	4405138	Nathan Gary and other executives and two dozen staff resigned.
4406127	4427933	a spokesperson for Annapurna Interactive well who's left at this point if they all resigned who's left but apparently there is a spokesperson maybe from the temp agency maybe Megan for Annapurna confirmed in a report to Bloomberg and Jason Schreier's reporting at Bloomberg that they had explored spinning off the company into an independent entity but there was a failure to reach an agreement
4428843	4436589	In a statement to Bloomberg, Megan Ellison said, Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition.
4436990	4451341	We're committed to not only our existing slate of games, but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming and theater.
4452122	4454323	Are you going to make a game when you don't have staff?
4454744	4455464	Well, they're not making it.
4455564	4456165	They're publishing it.
4457743	4464583	It's going to be more difficult, but my thought is here's the reality.
4465970	4476879	We've had thousands of people across the industry in these sorts of publishing roles that have been laid off and are looking for new jobs.
4477519	4483784	If Annapurna wants to find talented individuals to fill these roles, they're probably not going to have a problem.
4484585	4486346	That's the reality of the situation.
4486366	4491630	That's why it's even more like those folks literally quit publishing.
4492230	4498852	In the state of the industry right now, that's why I say like it took, they obviously felt very strongly about what was going on.
4499232	4508555	Because it really sounds like those individuals, to quote a TV or movie adage, will be easily replaced.
4510216	4514397	I don't mean that literally, but I feel like that's like the vibe I'm getting from these statements.
4515938	4516038	Um...
4517173	4523339	If a developer has a publishing contract with Annapurna, apparently they're scrambling to find new points of contact.
4523499	4529544	But the same spokesperson had told Bloomberg that all existing games and projects are still under the company.
4529964	4540474	And the newly appointed president, Hector Sanchez, congrats on your ascension, has told developers it will honor existing contracts and replace the departed staff.
4544121	4544722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4563479	4567803	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4584978	4594580	So yes, you're going to have Annapurna 2.0, but now you're going to have this mystery competitor yet to be announced, but I bet will be announced in the coming months.
4595321	4600802	So, I mean, y'all wanted more competition in the gaming industry, here you go.
4602402	4605003	This is just a weird fucking way for it to happen.
4610316	4613058	SSJO and Hunter Matt says, what are the games Annapurna was working on?
4613158	4614199	Is the publishing rights with?
4614339	4615960	Is Silent Hill Townfall?
4616520	4620403	And maybe you'll get a delay from this, but I don't, it's not going to stop the game from happening.
4621784	4622945	Wild, wild, wild.
4623746	4626488	So, all right, let's move on.
4626548	4628309	DarkSakura on a very different note.
4630092	4636158	So, um, now, you know, we super, super, super support game preservation.
4636719	4645507	What we don't support is making a profit off of game preservation, if you know what I mean.
4646248	4652154	Like, people going back and selling retro games.
4653462	4660335	but pirated, rebuilt versions of them lying about what you're selling, basically
4661391	4676847	Yeah, this is what actually was going on in Italy and this game ring that was worth 50 million euros was finally broken into by Italian police.
4677888	4681291	Fake vintage consoles and games.
4681972	4683394	For those who don't know, that's about...
4685155	4686957	a bit over $55 million.
4687057	4687378	U.S.
4689620	4689980	dollars.
4690801	4697788	So, I mean, there were games that were like Street Fighter 2, Super Mario Bros., Star Wars, you know, the stuff that people want.
4697828	4699229	I'm sure that there were like
4699950	4704873	Some of the really big ones that people will actually pay top dollar for.
4706314	4717080	Just taking advantage of the whole retro gaming swing, they said it was about 12,000 consoles and over 47 million pirated games.
4717680	4718301	and DarkSakura.com
4739173	4739934	It was a lot.
4740094	4746598	And then he also said that these are from all over China and were imported to be sold in specialized shops or online.
4747679	4756084	They were fitted with non-certified batteries and electrical circuits and did not pass EU technical or safety standards.
4756805	4760067	The games and consoles have been destroyed.
4761128	4768653	Nine Italian nationals have been arrested and charged with trading in counterfeited goods and they can face up to eight years in prison.
4770134	4786102	um yeah it's you know when we have in a world where you know sealed copies of you know retro games are selling for ridiculous amounts of money yeah
4787045	4788566	This doesn't surprise me.
4789366	4791907	I'm glad that they were able to knock that down.
4794088	4806614	100% what you just said there about that people are realizing there's money to be made in the game collection area and people are willing to do seedy things to pass things off as things that aren't legit.
4807234	4816158	I remember one time, this is not quite the same thing, but this is how I learned that lesson, that there are people that will try to pass things off or maybe misrepresent it a little bit.
4816978	4820163	I was at Denio's auction, right?
4820303	4821424	Out in Roseville, right?
4821444	4822486	A little bit of local stuff.
4822506	4823567	Is Peter Dan still out there?
4823767	4826090	I don't know who it was that I bought from, and I don't know.
4826210	4829735	No, because the place across the street is no longer there.
4829775	4832158	And this was when I was in the place across the street from Denio's.
4832298	4832679	Gotcha.
4832739	4833079	What was that?
4833159	4833960	I don't remember where that place was.
4834421	4834681	Also...
4835262	4837423	The purchase I regret the most ever.
4837824	4850151	They had a full-on BurgerTime cabinet, legitimate cabinet that they were selling for $400 and I should have fucking bought it that day because then that place closed like a month later and I never will see one of those that cheap again.
4850171	4850511	But anyway.
4851171	4851652	I digress.
4852112	4860017	What I really bought that day is I found for the Super Nintendo, I was like, oh my gosh, it's a sealed copy of Clue for the Super Nintendo.
4860097	4860958	This is incredible.
4861298	4862339	I'm going to buy this.
4862359	4864220	I fucking love Clue on the Super Nintendo.
4864240	4865041	Fuck yeah, I'm going to buy this.
4865381	4868963	And so I bought it and I brought it home and I took it because I wanted to fucking play it.
4869003	4870785	So I took it out of the ceiling and then realized,
4871525	4875286	Oh, all the cards in here and the instruction manual on the game, they've already been filled out.
4875386	4876086	People use this.
4876666	4878807	Somebody just resealed this game.
4879387	4881588	Now, in fairness, that was my mistake.
4882088	4889470	The person wasn't trying to pass it off as like sealed brand new, but the presenting on the shelf gave that impression.
4889910	4891771	And so this person didn't do anything illegal.
4891991	4894531	I'm just saying I learned a lesson that day.
4895011	4898512	How easy it is to represent a collectible.
4898532	4899353	Was it shrink-wrapped?
4899653	4900693	Yeah, that whole thing.
4902150	4904291	You can usually tell by the kind of shrink wrapping.
4904512	4907974	Well, yeah, but that was the whole like, oh, fuck, I need to learn that lesson.
4908734	4920843	And so it just goes to show not just that, but to reseal or shrink wrap or whatever, or now what people can do is dumping their own cartridges.
4921463	4928708	Like Loki has his own Pixel Poops 2 on legitimate cartridges that he did, he put together.
4928728	4929869	Which I still want one.
4929889	4930269	Yeah.
4930589	4931329	All right, moving on.
4931369	4931529	Loki.
4960734	4969302	Alright, so this has been going on for a while, like this whole controversy with Unity and changing other prices, and they kind of backed down from that.
4969763	4975709	And the new thing that was supposed to be coming is that runtime beat with the new versions of Unity.
4976189	4977550	I think that's supposed to be starting in 2025.
4981354	5002171	but now almost a year later after they announced their changes and then walked that back they are not going to be implementing the runtime fee and Unity will return to a subscription model with that the personal license will remain free until the game has brought in $200,000 in revenue
5005799	5017295	or funding and then also a Unity Pro subscription though however will increase by 8% to $2,200 a year and Enterprise will also increase by 25% um
5022594	5023875	Let's see, other changes.
5023915	5031762	So previously, the Unity Personal was capped at, it was $100,000 is where you had to hit it before you had to pay the fee.
5031782	5033943	So now they have upped that to $200,000.
5036025	5041890	Also, the Made with Unity splash screen will still be optional for games developed with Unity 6.
5043691	5046354	And that's set to launch later this year.
5047830	5050051	And I believe that's everything.
5050231	5070120	Oh, they said, yeah, with the Unity Enterprise, it says experience, you know, their 25% increase with new minimum subscription requirements for customers generating over $25 million in annual revenue, which, yeah, when I see them, I'm like, I'm never going to see that kind of money ever in anything.
5071994	5078296	Alright, well, interesting that, you know, it's almost in some ways quietly reverted all this time later after the controversy.
5078316	5082837	But it's still notable that it's happened this way, so.
5083398	5090980	Yeah, and with that, like, even though they've walked everything back, I think there's folks that are just still hesitant about it.
5091160	5094161	Like, yeah, they did it this time, but what...
5095221	5097302	What's going to happen the next time they want to change something?
5097562	5100523	Again, not to keep drilling this home, but I'm going to.
5100643	5105764	The perception of Unity now, based on how quick they made that change, yeah, not a great look.
5107245	5109145	It's going to take time to earn that trust back, right?
5109205	5114947	And decisions were made that week to pivot to other platforms when all that shit went down with Unity.
5115087	5119368	Those were decisions you can't go back on at a certain point.
5119888	5126055	So, you know, but this is Unity continuing to try to get that trust back with a lot of people, I think.
5127896	5128517	A year later.
5128877	5129158	We'll see.
5129278	5130819	All right.
5131638	5137221	Anyhow, let's talk about the PlayStation 5 and a firmware update that happened this week that is going to be adding.
5137621	5141302	I haven't seen this yet, but I also haven't launched my PlayStation 5 today.
5141463	5144584	I launched it the day the firmware update went out and I didn't see this.
5145144	5147885	But it's slowly rolling out across the coming days.
5147925	5149006	So some of you may have seen it.
5149066	5151387	It's a customizable home screen.
5151447	5152668	So it's going to be a little bit different.
5153508	5155849	You'll have a new welcome hub on your PlayStation 5.
5156730	5159851	And they're saying it's basically like a canvas that you can fill with widgets.
5160351	5165294	I'm really reminded of cell phones because iOS and Android both do this in their own ways.
5165614	5172758	You have these different widgets you can put on your home screen of the phone that show you like, here's the weather, here's the battery charge.
5172838	5179821	I like the one on iOS that lets you see the battery charge on all your devices at once so I know if I need to plug something in.
5180202	5180342	So
5181142	5182784	It's very that, but for Sony.
5183245	5186649	So you can see things like, again, battery level for accessories.
5186669	5191975	You can see your storage space, which of your friends are online, which trophies you've recently gotten, and all that stuff.
5191995	5195078	This is going to replace the Explore tab that's currently there.
5195479	5197841	You can resize and arrange things, which is cool.
5198002	5199203	It's a way that you can customize.
5199784	5201366	And you can change the background.
5201886	5203207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5214622	5215663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5234744	5241491	Also in this update, a little lesser known feature, but personalized 3D audio profiles.
5241951	5248798	If you have headphones or earbuds, this will let you make various adjustments to better fit unique hearing characteristics.
5249318	5254119	This is currently in beta, but look forward to more updates and all that good stuff.
5254179	5258340	Apparently, party voice chat links will be able to be shared on messaging or social media.
5258700	5265541	So you could literally drop a messaging link on threads or something and people could join your chats.
5265901	5267681	Or I could go to Discord or something and do that.
5267721	5270982	That could be very interesting, even if you're not friends on the PlayStation Network.
5271042	5275903	Of course, you'd want to use that responsibly, but I could see that kind of opening up different things.
5277605	5277945	There it is.
5278826	5284590	Jason also pointing out, since I brought up cell phones, Jason mentioning iOS 18 lands tomorrow.
5284730	5286351	That's a pretty big deal in the Apple world.
5287872	5295538	He also continues, widgets and personalization on a gaming console, of course, makes sense, but doing the same stuff as a phone does seem silly.
5295778	5305204	Well, it feels like it's... I don't think it's going to show weather and news headlines like your phone does, but I think it's going to show things that are relevant to the PlayStation console, which I think is kind of interesting.
5305584	5305685	So...
5306405	5315332	By the way, I did order an iPhone Pro Max 16 a couple days ago because I had a lot of credit at work.
5315512	5317574	So I was like, eh, what the heck?
5317934	5320976	Because we get incentives that we can trade in for gift cards.
5321377	5326161	And I just stock up Apple gift cards because I know Rob loves expensive toys from Apple.
5326521	5329703	So I just stock up the Apple gift cards and cash them in.
5330784	5333987	I will tell you privately.
5334227	5334707	Okay, okay.
5337290	5341231	Jason in chat says, I may have also pre-ordered a 16 Pro Max today.
5341692	5342512	May have.
5343032	5344032	Sounds like you did.
5344933	5345373	Guess what?
5345493	5349954	I had to do it twice because the first time I forgot to apply my balance, but I got it all sorted out.
5349974	5350354	We're good.
5350414	5350754	We're good.
5351194	5352635	But I'm excited.
5353235	5353515	All right.
5354596	5355016	I'm due.
5355316	5355696	I'm due.
5356376	5356676	All right.
5357056	5357717	Let's move on.
5357777	5359397	Let's travel back to a simpler time.
5359417	5359817	You know what?
5360117	5361898	Your consoles didn't have widgets.
5362458	5364839	Your cell phones didn't tell you the weather.
5365279	5372482	If you wanted to know the time, you called time, and it would say, at the sound of the tone, the time will be 7.35 p.m.
5373242	5373962	Beep.
5375383	5377263	That's how you knew the fucking time on your phone.
5377884	5379024	It's the classic game of the week.
5379044	5380705	Was yours British?
5381245	5381665	Actually...
5383991	5384832	Are we going to digress?
5384892	5386394	Yes, we are, before I roll the bumper.
5387015	5389698	We used to have, I wish I remember the phone number.
5389858	5391360	Loki, maybe you remember this.
5391920	5396526	It was, I think it was, it was something, it was a gag we used to do on Under Sedation Live.
5397631	5399914	I think the number was 332-2222.
5400094	5404260	I don't call it because I don't think this exists anymore.
5404620	5409426	But when you would call it, it would go, hello, my name is Mona.
5410247	5413472	And at the sound of the moan, the time will be 736 p.m.
5418897	5444238	and that was the thing and then it would play an ad it played an ad for some porn site or 900 number or something but I just remember that Mona was like the alternative to time I sort of remember I feel like every I feel like every teenage boy knew about Mona all right uh where was I oh yes classic game here we go
5455037	5462340	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5462800	5465401	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5465921	5467862	And this is a pretty rad game tonight, DarkSakura.
5467882	5468402	What did you pick?
5469597	5475022	I picked, I was like, because we don't have the wiki and I didn't want to decode all the XML.
5475482	5478384	Thank you, DT, for sending me the XML of the site.
5478465	5481327	And DarkTetsuya is working on that and thinks he can get it back.
5481447	5487652	Apparently there was a problem with one of the transcripts that had some dirty language in it that the website didn't like.
5487772	5490495	But anyway, sorry, but you reminded me to make that update.
5490535	5490875	Sorry, Jamie.
5493430	5495071	The game is Super Don Quixote.
5496932	5498653	They spell it really weird.
5499813	5504435	It's like Q-U-I-X-O-T-E when there wasn't that in the original novel.
5507897	5512199	First of all, it was a Laserdisc video game that was released by Universal in 1984.
5512460	5518643	You play as the knight Don to rescue a princess from a witch named Leona.
5519503	5532868	It is very loosely based on the novel Don Quixote, which, if you've never read Don Quixote, it just sounds like such a weird thing to derive from.
5533428	5538670	Although I love the full title being The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.
5540050	5543251	But it's also kind of a parody novel.
5543311	5544312	Anyway, back to the game.
5548025	5551886	It's like Dragon's Lair in Space Ace.
5552666	5560708	You have the icon that points out which of your little quick time events to do.
5563088	5566529	And it actually has the overlay that shows you.
5567529	5572790	But most of the other ones didn't do anything except giving you a flash that's incorporated into the animation.
5574190	5598364	so basically you are Don who is trying to save Princess Isabella from Leona who is going to sacrifice her to a demon he has a donkey that goes with him that's based on the original Don Quixote's horse I always mispronounce this
5599224	5608212	Rosinante and a fat little man called Sancho that is based on Sancho Panza who is his sidekick in the book.
5612396	5612596	You
5614478	5625385	Really the only big things that has in common with the book, apart from some certain character names, is the fight at the giant windmill, but everything else is really fucking weird.
5625525	5636312	You fight a mummy, a dragon, skeletons, demons, giant snakes, flying electric jellyfish, a totem pole, Leona's daughter, and a bunch of other stuff that has nothing to do with the book!
5637793	5638534	And, um...
5640396	5645858	Yeah, you slay the lady, the witch, and you go home.
5646078	5646758	End of story.
5647818	5660082	But it was the first and only game that was ever released on the Universal System 1, which was supposed to be a standard Laserdisc video game system.
5660563	5666625	They had other games that were planned for it that were never released, including Adventure Middle-Earth, Adventure Time Mr. Do,
5667805	5671969	Timeslip, Circus Circus, Space Dracula, and Wilderness Kingdom.
5672009	5673551	Where's my Space Dracula, okay?
5675133	5681860	Another game from Universal that followed a similar format was Captain Zap, which is a motorbike combat game.
5682981	5683101	And
5684622	5692745	It was also the only Laserdisc game to be demonstrated at London's Associated Leisure Preview 86 or Arcadia 86 show they did in October 1985.
5692885	5707750	In Japan, Game Machine listed this on their December 15, 1984 issue as being the most successful upright arcade unit of the month.
5709731	5727805	Computer and Video Games gave it a positive review in December 1984, saying that the movements of all characters are smooth and beautifully depicted, really praising the animation, that they didn't think it was as much fun as Dragon's Lair, but said that Don Quixote was a lot less frustrating.
5729266	5734890	So yeah, pretty decently well-received, just, you know, didn't have Don Bluth behind it.
5735311	5736291	I mean, seriously.
5737352	5737632	But
5739724	5766688	but it's a pretty good one and I'm trying to actually see where the art house for this was but I'm not finding that in this article but at any rate they had one at California Extreme I played it for a hot minute but you know it's cute
5767659	5767979	You're right.
5768019	5770521	Oh, I was just going to say, you're absolutely right.
5770581	5774783	It's not Don Bluth, but I feel like they're kind of trying to go for that vibe still.
5775623	5776804	Yeah, they are.
5777024	5778445	It's why it's hard to figure out who it is.
5779986	5787650	And Don Bluth's animation is rather striking because it still has that kind of Disney vibe to it.
5788690	5791072	And this has a very anime vibe to it, you know?
5791472	5791692	Yeah.
5791712	5791792	Yeah.
5793648	5797731	The animation in it, I thought, is really nice.
5797811	5799633	It's really smooth and really good.
5801014	5802315	Clearly, this had a budget.
5802815	5804977	Especially when you consider, again, this is 1984.
5805477	5808379	This is not something that was made in the 90s, even.
5808419	5810121	It was pretty old.
5811562	5813123	We had other games, though.
5813143	5816645	Remember the VHS and DVD games that came out later?
5816665	5817226	Sure, sure.
5818297	5822538	Yeah, but this has nothing to do with the novel.
5822919	5823179	Yeah.
5824199	5824439	Alright.
5825619	5833042	Well, still, a very unique sort of game, and as SHO100Matt puts it in chat, I've never seen this game before, and now I kind of want to play it.
5833462	5836423	Well, I would call that another successful Classic Game of the Week.
5841368	5862946	all right thank you for that DarkSakura good pick good pick and hopefully we have a wiki working again next week uh so we could because we we use that as a resource ourselves and making sure we don't repeat things i use it too for the little bumps at the beginning i'm like have i made this joke before so it's important i do cliff jumper as a game
5863854	5864795	I'm pretty sure I did.
5865975	5867637	The loop in the third one.
5869057	5870078	There ought to be a way.
5870138	5874621	Well, I guess it sounds like Dark Titsy already did that to get that file so you can at least open that.
5874641	5876362	I have the XML.
5877103	5880105	I honestly didn't necessarily have a bunch of time.
5880185	5882046	In fact, let me open it in my XML editor.
5882726	5883227	All right, all right.
5884087	5890132	Well, while you plot out the next few classic games until we have a wiki back, let's... Dr. Sia says, stay tuned.
5890172	5892694	I'm hopeful to be back before post-TwitchCon.
5892754	5895136	All right, well, appreciate all your hard work on that for sure.
5895957	5899059	And yeah, I didn't even know we had transcripts on there.
5899660	5909327	I thought 13 Forever had their own transcript archive, which is... Because they had that software that did everything, which again...
5910580	5912622	I don't... You know, here's the thing.
5912862	5917245	I'm fine with you all who have been listening to this show for a long time and supporting this show a long time.
5917285	5922009	Like, if you want to find an old in-joke or something, I'm fine with you having access to transcripts.
5922429	5928914	Who I don't want having access to transcripts are people that are trying to dig old shit up on us to try to cancel us with.
5929254	5930755	Don't fucking play that game with me.
5931095	5939582	Because this show has been around for 22 years, and I've said it time and again, there is shit in the old episodes that was said I would not say today because...
5940202	5941203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5961818	5966982	You all that, you know, I know you all are just looking for, oh, when was the first time they brought this up?
5967002	5982294	Or like Loki, you had a really good, you were trying to figure out when Time to Penis originated on this show because you thought it could have been before what was being mentioned in some of the mainstream gaming media as the first instance of it.
5982334	5986698	Although it turns out it was the same year, but not technically before, at least what we can find.
5987138	5987758	So, yeah.
5987919	5988079	Yeah.
5989780	6000751	By the way, and this is just offering it really to anybody, if you are wanting something that's good for helping you read through XML or for doing Python coding, definitely look at Brackets.
6001892	6003534	Really, really good little app.
6005996	6011722	And that's like right now why I'm able to go in and just copy off the list of classic games in plain text.
6012262	6012482	Nice.
6012763	6012943	Okay.
6014203	6042577	and then so my point with the whole transcript discussion was just delete all the transcripts off the wiki it's not needed just it's fine you know what I would just rather if apparently there's problematic shit in it I would just rather it not be out there anyway so because it probably wasn't wasn't funny so just just delete it it's cool we we need that we want the useful shit like the episode summaries the classic game of the week and that type of stuff if somebody really wants a transcript they can go download the episode and there's tools to help you do that so
6043297	6043797	Alright, cool.
6043917	6045297	DarkTetsuya says that was the plan.
6045457	6045777	Alright.
6046218	6046618	I hear ya.
6046678	6047038	We're good.
6047078	6047398	We're good.
6047758	6048538	Alright, let's move on.
6048578	6053339	Let's get into some rapid fire news and cover some other headlines real quick.
6053939	6054599	Loki, we'll go to you.
6056119	6063761	Yeah, so there's now news that Tony Hawk is working on something with Activision.
6065101	6069822	Gee, I wonder what it could be that you would be working on with Activision.
6070162	6071222	I wish I could tell you more.
6071752	6086526	but I can't tell you that I or I can tell you that I've been working or talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting we're working on something this will be the first time I've said that publicly cool looking forward to it um
6087780	6114661	and then as people do with popular celebrities or people that have come into the spotlight a bit more recently since Tim Walls, the Democratic Vice President nominee mentioned that he used the game on the Dreamcast someone took it upon themselves to add him as a playable character in Dreamcast
6114781	6118621	Crazy Taxi, thanks to a mod.
6120663	6144226	that's that's brilliant I I think this is funny as fuck actually uh and I love that someone did this um interesting because we were talking about like the trademark and all that stuff you know using his likeness in the mod is that acceptable and actually another interesting sort of perk of uh law in that because he is a well-known federal politician uh the the parody is considered fair game
6144827	6146828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6169324	6172667	Obviously, my political leanings are no fucking secret on this show.
6172767	6175369	And I think the world of Tim Walls, I think he's fantastic.
6175950	6178412	And I love that somebody put him in Crazy Taxi.
6178432	6178952	I think it's great.
6180333	6182375	So can I interject something real quick?
6182495	6182835	Why not?
6184116	6186518	Well, this kind of goes back to something.
6186558	6192683	You remember how I talked about the people who were doing the Keitai game preservation?
6192703	6192964	Mm-hmm.
6193843	6197366	and how there had been like some that were still missing that they couldn't find.
6198267	6203171	They found one of the missing Professor Layton games.
6203571	6204452	Oh, cool.
6205593	6208575	Professor Layton and the Mansion of Deathly Mirror.
6209536	6212558	They found it on a phone that survived a house fire.
6213999	6214380	Wow.
6215320	6218523	All six chapters on an F906i.
6219344	6222146	They had before only had the first three chapters.
6222286	6223187	Now they have them all.
6224631	6242220	and there was also Mr. Driller Aqua and yeah so those were other games that they thought they were either never going to get the complete version of or at all lost games now alive and well on a survivor of a keitai
6243676	6244937	I thought I'd throw that out there.
6245097	6248459	It is so wild, the things that just turn up in the most random places.
6248519	6254723	It's like going garage sale in Silicon Valley and finding a prototype cartridge you would have never thought.
6255203	6255723	It's wild.
6256804	6261767	Oh, I picked up this junk for you at the flea market.
6262367	6263768	Where did you find an Appalisa?
6263888	6264388	Excuse me?
6267989	6271453	Where did you find a black label version of Symphony of the Night on PlayStation 1?
6272655	6274658	I find those all the time.
6275559	6276120	Wasn't that rare?
6276140	6279084	Isn't there some Konami PlayStation game that's super rare?
6279104	6280787	Oh, Suikoden, probably.
6281365	6298235	Yeah, I mean, well, I have both versions of Final Fantasy VII, and we had the import of Symphony first, of Nocturne and the Moonlight, and then got the US one as soon as it came out, because this was Dan.
6300677	6301017	All right.
6301978	6303919	Anyway, DarkSakura, you have a rapid-fire story for us.
6305240	6305840	I do.
6306220	6307141	Tell a plan!
6308802	6309983	It's just fun to say, tell a plan.
6310223	6310423	Mm-hmm.
6311318	6325740	excuse me I'm sorry I just had a choke on something they are doing reissues of more Toaplan shmups Slap Fight and Grindstormer
6327481	6332743	from Rattalaika Games and Shin Uden.
6333283	6335044	So that's cool.
6335824	6338665	We're getting some more fun Toaplan stuff.
6338885	6340125	So yeah.
6340845	6354650	Slap Fight is a vertical shooter that came out in 1986 and then later came to Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Thompson MO5, Thompson T8, and the Mega Drive.
6355450	6380835	Grindstormer which was the spiritual successor came out in 93 and it was out in arcades before it came out on the Mega Drive slash Genesis by Tengen in 1994 and they've been very emulated on Steam and the GOGs and now we get this also it's just fun to say Slap Fight
6382970	6383290	All right.
6384971	6385871	Moving on.
6386492	6390554	There's been too much talk of the Dreamcast this week and not enough talk about the Sega Saturn.

6573882	6575323	How can you have a moonless moon?
6576423	6577543	My moon has no moon on it.
6577904	6578664	It could be a new moon.
6580318	6582279	We can't see the moon, but the moon's still there.
6582620	6583220	That is true.
6583601	6585662	But the moon can see you.
6585963	6591307	It could be a miracle moon.

6611724	6612024	That's it.
6612345	6617689	I don't want it unless it repeatedly plays that song, you're the best, around over and over again.
6617709	6618910	I agree.
6622923	6624624	Moving on, let's check out Japan.
6624704	6625844	Quick, everybody, get in the car.
6625884	6629165	Let's go to Japan and check out the releases there on the Nintendo Switch.

6650571	6654752	and then tell me more about Bang on Balls Chronicles.
6655052	6656432	Yes, that is the name of the game.
6657693	6660273	Why don't you go bang on balls?
6662014	6663874	I got your balls right here.
6664414	6665114	Tennis balls.
6666415	6669415	Yes, this looks like angry birds, but they're balls.
6671036	6671616	Angry balls.
6672276	6672536	Anyway.
6673442	6674742	What other balls jokes can I make?
6674802	6676163	How about Born of Bread?
6677003	6678784	Also coming out in Japan this week.
6679464	6680164	Kids like bread.
6680544	6684125	I feel like the sequel to I Am Bread.
6684145	6685305	Born of Bread.
6685665	6686226	Wait, hold on.
6686786	6687746	This gets better.
6688146	6690747	You are a sentient bread on a quest...
6695159	6718904	you play as a flower golem that's F-L-O-U-R a flower golem who possesses a never-ending childlike wonder and a set of odd abilities it comes with a home-cooked battle system should be a home-baked battle system I don't know and team up with your buddies because Loaf, the main character can't do it alone
6720689	6728138	I wanna know what rabbi ran out of rocks and decided to make a golem out of flour.
6729349	6735951	I wanna know how fucking high did somebody get when they decided to make... Hey, hey, hey, man.
6736051	6736732	Hey, hey, hey.
6738532	6739273	That was a good one.
6739293	6742774	Try Board of Sativa is what this game sounds like to me.
6742974	6749116	What if, man, what if, what if, what if Fred could walk?
6749216	6751217	And lastly on the Switch Japan this week...
6752905	6756408	Kama Itachi no Yoru is also out on the Switch.
6756708	6758089	How about the PlayStation 5?
6758169	6762852	We also have Death End Request Code Z. Bang on Balls Chronicles is there as well.
6762952	6765454	Also a game called Candle Night is there as well.
6765494	6773259	And if you can't get enough bread, you can get more on the PS5 as Board of Bread is also out on the PlayStation 5 in Japan this week.
6773619	6774139	Oh my gosh.
6774620	6782485	I named this game after the club I went to Bang on Balls because that's all they did all night.
6784466	6785146	Okay, I'm done.
6785686	6786787	How about Europe, DarkSakura?
6789008	6789948	We ain't seen shit.
6789968	6790428	I'm just kidding.
6790588	6795530	Anyway, on the 16th, we have Phoenix Falls for PC.
6797171	6801592	On the 17th, Throne and Liberty for PC, PS5, Xboxes, blah blah.
6801973	6804494	Final Fantasy 16 also for PC on the 17th.
6806860	6824989	Also Star Wars Jedi Survivor, PS4, Xbox One, The Plicky Squire, all the things, Enotria, the last song for PC, UFO 50 on the 18th, Enotria for PS5 on the 19th, God of War Ragnarok for PC on 19th.
6825529	6827430	I guess a re-release or something?
6828110	6851528	Broken Sword, Shadow of the Templars for all of the things also on the 19th Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster on the 19th Monument Valley on Netflix Bzzzt on Switch on the 19th Frostpunk 2 for PC on the 20th I'm sorry, how many Z's in Bzzzt?
6854950	6856191	Yeah, that many
6858254	6864039	Oh is that it?
6868137	6872178	I mean, I could go another week after that since I won't be here, but no.
6872618	6872998	That's fine.
6873058	6873418	That's fine.
6874499	6876179	We'll let it be a surprise for people.
6876739	6876919	All right.
6876939	6878580	Actually, none of us will be here next week.
6878600	6880340	I think we said that, but there's no show next week.
6881220	6882541	Loki and DarkSakura at TwitchCon.
6882581	6886642	I'm not doing a show by myself, but also I'm in Seattle for completely unrelated reasons.
6887142	6888242	So we're not here.
6888322	6892543	Bobby Blackwolf will be here, though, to hold down the fort and catch you up on all the news of the week.
6892643	6895684	So check that out for those of you here live at the Voice Geeks Network.
6896164	6900467	Alright, we have a few more headlines for you and then we'll see if there's any calls or any of that good stuff.
6900787	6903088	But Loki, you have some Minecraft news.
6904309	6912354	Yeah, so we were just waiting to hear what's going on with Minecraft Live because that's usually around middle of October.
6913755	6921900	But Minecraft put out, or I should say Mojang put out an announcement talking about changes to how they're going to be doing updates.
6924001	6925422	So my opinion is that they're just...
6927332	6931556	They're kind of trying to do less.
6931616	6936321	I mean, they're trying less hard now, I guess, with updates.
6937282	6941446	Being that there's no more themed updates anymore.
6941666	6948093	They're going to try... I mean, they've already said that they were going to be doing this, trying to push out smaller updates instead of just waiting for...
6948593	6967602	A larger update release so there's gonna be lots of sub updates which sucks for mod developers because then you have to constantly update your mods every time they break stuff which is all the time especially now that they're going to like a component-based system on the back end so it's kind of changing how everything's structured but in the long run it'll be nice
6968362	6973384	They are now confirming that they're going to be doing two Minecraft Live showcases instead of one.
6974844	6976685	Still not confirming when that first one's going to be.
6977365	6982287	If that's still going to be in October and then there'll be like another one in the spring or what the case may be.
6984249	7013557	so we're just going to kind of wait to hear about that hopefully in the next couple weeks we'll get a date on that because that should be right around the corner oh and mob votes are going away so that's a big one because it's pretty contentious typically with Minecraft Live they have the Minecraft players vote on which mob they want in the next update and you know in the past you've had like large creators like Dream manipulated to put the crappiest mob of the bunch in there you've had
7015129	7040474	other votes seem to be kind of manipulated or just like weird so now they're just getting rid of it all together honestly I don't understand why they do it that way in the first place it really should have just been here's three mobs we're going to bring them to the game which one do you want in there first and we'll prioritize that one and then the other two will come in later on like that would be the best way to do it but that's not how they operate so whatever um
7041991	7047976	But yeah, so that's what we're looking forward to more announcements and smaller updates.
7048516	7054381	Like I said, with the theme stuff, the last few updates that they've done with Tricky Trials and...
7056172	7058173	I don't even know if that's... Trails and Tales.
7058673	7066856	It's felt very... Here's some features we have done and we're going to shove them all together and what kind of theme does that feel like, you know, with that?
7066976	7068737	It's not kind of working towards a theme.
7069157	7076539	It's more of here's what we have done and it's the tricky trials.
7076599	7078640	Yeah, that's it because the trial chambers are in here.
7078800	7080881	Or it's the armored...
7082011	7110356	dog armored armadillo one it's got dog armor and armadillos yay um so I think they're just now they're just not even going to try to come up with a theme for it and it'll be just like okay this is what's coming out and here's what it is and stuff like that but I know there's lots of tweaks that they're doing I'm just kind of curious about when all that's going to come out and what what that means to the game because they're retooling a lot of stuff um will we be getting a Minecraft update on who won the fucking Mega Man competition
7114606	7115646	This is an old joke.
7115786	7116947	It's coming.
7117187	7118507	They're still deliberating.
7118527	7120688	This is an old joke at this point, for those that don't get the joke.
7121168	7128231	Loki created an incredible fucking Mega Man build that absolutely would win this competition, but we'll never know because Microsoft never named a winner.
7129152	7130252	Yep, they never named a winner.
7130272	7136514	It was their first... Well, it wasn't the first, but it was one of the first feature-me Minecraft...
7138459	7138939	and DarkSakura.
7163639	7169423	The whole point was that it was supposed to be everyone does steampunk or they do cyberpunk and stuff like that.
7169963	7172324	Nobody has done Mega Man.
7172764	7175226	And so I just thought, okay, let's just run with that.
7177347	7178948	And so I thought, this is perfect.
7179048	7181269	Look what I found with a Google search on Reddit.
7181389	7181949	How about that?
7182509	7182990	How about that?
7184844	7186065	DarkSakura's VTuber is...
7210875	7237564	I don't know why VTuber makes it funnier I was also spelling taco yeah they do the live events in October typically what's been and in each year it's been less and less exciting because at first they showed off okay we're going to do the wild update and the wild update was supposed to be we're taking all the existing biomes in the game and we're going back and making them feel more full of life
7238044	7254133	and we're going to be tweaking and they showed an example here's what we imagine the birch forest could look like and they had some concept art and then the update came out and it's like well where are all these biome changes that you said you're going to have because all you've included is you have one new swamp biome
7254881	7257342	Which is cool, that's great, that's a new biome.
7257502	7262004	And then one biome that was left over from the previous update that you just didn't have done at the time.
7262444	7264065	How was that the wild update?
7264105	7266226	You didn't do the thing that you said that you were going to do.
7266526	7270428	They're like, well, that was just concept art, we never promised that we were going to do all these things.
7270468	7273669	Like, that was the whole point of calling it the wild update.
7273749	7276871	You explained it, that this is what you were going to do, and you did none of it, so...
7277851	7284075	and when you're wondering why people are upset and they're like, well, we're just never going to show you guys concept art anymore because you guys are just going to take it out.
7284155	7285056	We're putting it in the game.
7285076	7286497	It's like, oh my God.
7286977	7289979	Like with the communication stuff, it's ridiculous.
7290219	7296803	Before we get to our next story, I'm kind of curious what you think about this chat comment over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network as we are broadcasting live.
7297424	7303387	Zenmonkey11 in chat says, just make Minecraft 2 and leave old Minecraft alone, please.
7303587	7304248	They'll never do it.
7306189	7313799	I would have thought Minecraft 2 would have happened a long time ago, but I think we get these spin-off games instead.
7314560	7323912	It's just going to be constantly supporting this one, because they're monetizing it on the Bedrock side, which is the majority of...
7325491	7333118	I don't even know what the breakdown between Java and Bedrock is, but there's a lot of stuff being supported through Bedrock.
7333238	7337943	Lots of the marketplace stuff, those add-ons, that's big business for them.
7337963	7339224	They're making lots of money.
7340505	7343588	You could technically sell on their storefront as well.
7343648	7344850	You could set up as a creator.
7344910	7345050	I've
7345730	7349693	One of our cast members does that sort of on the side as a few things.
7350134	7353116	They put out cosmetics on there and stuff.
7353516	7354497	So it's a big business for them.
7354517	7359020	That's where they're making the money to keep the game going because obviously they're not selling a ton of new copies.
7359621	7368668	But yeah, I don't think they'll ever put out a Minecraft 2 because then they'll splinter their player base and...
7370805	7371406	I don't know.
7371826	7374528	They would have to stop supporting those older platforms and stuff.
7374568	7376990	And they just kind of keep evolving the game as it is.
7377691	7379012	I just don't see them doing that.
7379332	7382055	I mean, I would buy it, but I just don't see them doing that.
7382275	7386679	Yeah, Jason in chat says, there's no such thing as a sequel in a live service game.
7387459	7390404	Diablo says hello, but I get your point.
7390544	7391926	I do.
7391966	7401920	There was a time and place where I sort of thought Minecraft 2 was an inevitability when Microsoft came in and bought it, but I think we kind of got the spinoff games instead, and it's just more about refining...
7404723	7407705	I'm bringing new people into this existing game.
7407845	7410047	And the movie is going to be an interesting effect on that.
7410107	7412388	Although I also think the movie is going to be kind of a non-starter.
7412849	7414290	Because I don't think it's going to be very good.
7414330	7414750	But we'll see.
7415590	7417011	It's hard to say with the movie.
7417031	7417051	I...
7419212	7419572	FPMobile
7444850	7445770	I could... I don't know.
7445870	7447211	I could see them doing a sequel.
7447311	7450031	It would just be a tough sell, I think, to get a lot of people there.
7450071	7456493	Because then you would be... You have all those, like, bedrock players that are playing, like, the older versions and stuff.
7457193	7459854	How would you sell that content to them?
7459894	7465655	I think it's more profitable to, like... What they've done in the last few updates is they've tweaked all of the back...
7466215	7488491	and stuff like to make everything component based now the way that the data is set up and it's supposed to make it easier for like map makers and mod developer add-on developers and stuff for on the bedrock side because they sell add-ons it's it's essentially selling mods um there's usually you buy maps or you can get add-ons that do different things um
7489674	7493700	and so they're kind of working it towards that because that's what's going to bring them in the money.
7493820	7498967	Like doing a sequel, yeah, they would get those initial sales right off the bat, but they'd be in the same boat that they're in now.
7499247	7504855	Plus now they have to support two different sets of games and it's just, I don't know.
7504875	7505195	Who knows?
7505436	7506177	Maybe they'll do it someday.
7507608	7509390	Alright, one more story for you all.
7509410	7513573	Well, speaking about, you know, live service games, let's talk about an Ubisoft live service game.
7513593	7514554	Let's talk about The Crew.
7515155	7527186	Of course, the original Crew is no more, but we have The Crew 2 that is still ongoing, which, by the way, it was brought to my attention in our Discord server this week over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, cheap plug.
7527926	7533652	You can join us and chat throughout the week, such as the alert that came through that The Crew 2 was on sale for a dollar.
7534232	7545452	and still is I believe for another week so if you want to pick up the crew too for one whole dollar you can do that right now I think that's on Steam somebody correct me if I'm wrong in chat but I think that was on Steam um
7546946	7547806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7568697	7578825	So apparently, a tweet that went out from the official Crew account called AtTheCrewGames said, We heard your concerns about access to the Crew games.
7579305	7584008	Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of the Crew 2 and the Crew Motor Fest.
7584469	7589392	We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long-term access to both titles.
7589852	7592274	Stay tuned for more news in the next months.
7592674	7597678	In other words, please do not bring this back up to the British government because they're likely to fuck us up.
7598398	7614968	on this but this is you know what I mean I don't like to say bullying works but in this case maybe it was necessary because now they're getting now the offline mode is getting happening um so that's that's cool that uh we're getting gonna get an offline mode and this game can essentially live forever
7615308	7642704	which must mean they're also planning on pulling the plug on this game at some point at least on the crew too well if you want to find out for better or worse again it's only a dollar right now so you can check that out apparently that will be coming in the next few months when that comes out at least the good news is you can expect they're not going to pull the plug until that patch is ready to go so that is that is kind of neat yeah for a dollar I'll probably check it out too to be quite honest so we'll see what happens with that
7644158	7647140	Well, with that, that is all the official stories we had slotted tonight.
7647261	7650583	We will open up the green room on Discord if anybody wants to give us a call tonight.
7650944	7656868	But I do want to visit our mailbag, though I don't think we got anything, but maybe I am wrong.
7658470	7664975	If you want to email us, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place where you can send us an email every week.
7665015	7668678	Well, we don't have an email, but we do have somebody in the green room waiting to get on the air.
7668778	7671581	So let's go to Discord and say hello.
7671661	7672681	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7672702	7673022	Who's this?
7673593	7677537	Long time no see, or at least like two hours and 15 minutes and sporadically in chat.
7677677	7680119	Jason, it's so good to have you on tonight.
7680179	7680860	Hello, hello.
7680900	7685564	Thank you for being here, especially in light of the announcement we were talking about earlier tonight.
7686265	7686725	I mean it.
7686765	7689968	We wouldn't be here without you, so I'm glad you can partake in tonight's episode.
7690413	7691274	And then you start the show and...
7719354	7720816	Oh, wow.
7720996	7727426	That is 100% legit and real and deserved and well broken down by your statements at the top of the show.
7727766	7729329	Yeah, wild stuff.
7730130	7730771	Surprise!
7733254	7733795	You know what's funny?
7733815	7734256	You didn't even...
7735678	7745648	So behind the scenes inside baseball, I had some other stuff going on today with the love horror events that I host here locally for some promo early stuff I was working on.
7746149	7752295	And so I didn't get our show role, which is basically like, I don't want to say script, but it's basically like the outline that's like,
7752755	7776630	Jamie's gonna talk about this Matt's gonna talk about this like that whole thing it's gonna show that in advance and I almost sent it to Jay or because I couldn't get that out until late I didn't send it to like 4 30 pacific tonight which is very late usually I have that out by one two o'clock and I was gonna text Jason and say because Jason needs that so he knows what to intro at the top of the show and I almost sent you a text that said hey Sherwell's gonna be late just talk about PS5 Pro or the Guinness World Record
7777390	7780453	So if I'd sent you that text, I would have ruined the whole thing.
7780893	7782815	Because I just assumed you knew.
7784156	7788660	No, I am aware that I am increasingly out of the loop.
7789661	7798528	Maybe due to age, maybe due to business, definitely due to not being in the mass media circle that everybody relies on for this kind of news.
7798548	7800550	I don't blame you for that decision one bit.
7801671	7803373	Sorry I didn't get to tell you personally.
7803473	7803673	Oops.
7804033	7805494	Hey, hey, I took the news directly.
7805534	7806194	I'm happy with that.
7806434	7819522	I do think it's kind of sad that people don't talk to each other to, you know, interact and learn about their lives, you know, and just expect that it was read online or something.
7819762	7819962	Yeah.
7820182	7824925	Like, people send me, like, Facebook stuff all the time, and I don't do Facebook at all.
7824965	7825665	Yeah, yeah.
7826566	7830048	Even more inside baseball, Rob, you didn't mention this at all.
7830108	7831549	We saw each other a month ago.
7832930	7833631	You know why?
7833711	7836133	And you said it was in the works for longer than that, didn't you?
7836253	7844442	Yeah, well, I knew about it in March or April, but if I didn't make it clear, I don't ever trust that these things are actually going to happen until they happen.
7844482	7847125	Right, right, because the book just printed and shipped.
7847225	7847986	The book just dropped.
7848006	7849627	It only officially became official.
7850248	7874923	I didn't even order the book because I was like eh I mean even though I did see so what they did send me I don't know how much I'm allowed to say but oops they did send me like a little preview that showed the picture and then it showed it showed that there was text there but it didn't I couldn't read the text it was like gray it looks like um like old ass fucking page makers zoomed out where all you see is gray blocks so that they sent you a picture of the proof
7875666	7877468	Yes, they sent me a picture of the proof, I guess.
7878109	7878789	But I couldn't see.
7878930	7880251	It was only that corner.
7880331	7881753	It didn't show anybody else.
7881853	7882994	I couldn't see the other show.
7883374	7887319	It just showed the corner with us in it because they were verifying.
7887359	7889020	They said, can you verify everybody's name?
7889060	7890602	And I did, and they still got it wrong.
7893425	7897630	Again, that is why I never trust these things until they actually happen.
7898380	7913296	Yeah, I have very much taken to, as a, perhaps related to, but I think for its own reasons, because I'm also not in the social networking, posting, commenting reactionosphere,
7915137	7921759	I also, like, I'll hear about things that are interesting basically just by headlines of trailers, directs, showcases, etc.
7923120	7928041	And, like, I'll take away a few things that I'm interested in, but then I just wait until it exists.
7928141	7930602	Because I don't care about what it is until it exists.
7930742	7932363	I don't care about that stuff anymore.
7934123	7934944	I take away...
7936124	7964118	taking away the knowledge of what something could have been appeals to is is relevant and no knock against journalists news rumor people like no no knock to the people that do it I don't so I don't part I have chosen not to partake in the the thick of the media only rather than the actual product itself and I get it I get it anyway I know you didn't call in to talk about Guinness night but we had to talk about it but what did you want to talk to us about tonight Jason
7964426	7971469	It's funny, because that segued perfectly because that last point is basically the one that I'm going to repeat with other examples.
7972950	7982975	That was the side in the intro for if you're not listening to it right now, you could go rewind and re-listen to the, is this what a politician feels like?
7983455	7985556	That I spoke out of the side of my mouth in the intro.
7986296	7989078	I have obviously used the intro as my own opinion.
7989518	7991859	Where's the butterfly meme?
7991999	7993000	Is this politics?
7995140	7998342	Even more relevant given the day of the month that it currently is.
7998362	7999603	Let me get Pikachu's face in there.
8000243	8001204	Is this politics?
8002965	8009489	ShockedPikachu.jpg.gif.mp4 It's in addition, because like I...
8010925	8016751	I backed Star Citizen to the tune of 200-something dollars in 2012.
8017572	8024179	And as I have turned into the result of the person that I am now, I see people talking about it whenever there's new content updates.
8024219	8025220	I see this, that, and the other.
8025640	8030405	My response or my internal voice says, call me when Squadron 42's out.
8030465	8032087	I don't give a shit about anything else.
8032507	8034109	MMOs, make your own adventure, no.
8034769	8055056	not my thing I bought it for Squadron 42 tell me when that's out I want to play it because I very much am a story directed experience kind of thing as well but I don't like my brain for the other things that I believe in and aligned with even if I don't practice keep
8056016	8057196	That's what I was talking about before.
8074542	8078644	Yeah, the Phoenix Wright, the Ace Attorney preservation.
8078684	8084267	I didn't remember if they mentioned that specifically, but yeah, when you said it, it was like, oh, hey, even more relation to the things going on in my brain.
8084828	8096054	I 100% believe in preservation, restoration, and everything, and it's kind of shitty to say that somebody needs to do the unpaid labor to enable it.
8097225	8097405	Oh, yeah.
8113927	8115148	and many more.
8137123	8138023	Landed With A Flop
8162314	8171001	It should be preserved for some kind of reference to look back on, and that's harder to do in gaming.
8171840	8186587	But when I speak, when I choose to speak of the 20 seconds that I have to come up with a point, I'm going to make it pretty concise, and it's going to be with the context of, for me, this is my opinion for myself.
8186927	8190528	I have been 100% digital only since 2010.
8193104	8193364	Wow.
8193465	8193745	Wow.
8193765	8194545	Wow.
8194565	8194706	Wow.
8212780	8214501	I have no way of using it.
8214921	8215901	That's an exaggeration.
8216002	8227046	I have a USB Blu-ray drive literally sitting right next to me, but my PC that I'm staring at, my laptop that I use on a daily basis, my car that I drive, none of those things have an optical media drive.
8227427	8230148	That medium is dying.
8231048	8252561	and yes, you're not part of the that medium is not part of the major market anymore so if you want it for any and every reason unfortunately some might say the minority the minority what the hell is the word I'm looking for the minority needs get to pay for it kind of a shitty thing to say but
8254450	8280804	it is an accessory, it is an extra you have to buy one to use your PS5 library for the people that have already probably spent way more money on physical media you can actually get sales on physical media I don't know, that's where I see my influence of the gaming era right now is that physical media is an accessory and that means it costs too, like every other accessory
8281164	8282986	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8299181	8323503	you know it kind of talked about that before was kind of like the equity of what that cartridge or that disc or whatever is still worth especially when we know we kind of talked about earlier in the show sometimes these collectible things are hot items like you know look what's look what's happening for conquered whether it's eye rolling or you know not you know suddenly these this physical medium the last way to actually have a piece of this game is suddenly like very popular even if we're kind of rolling our eyes at it or not you know so
8324284	8340440	or it's as simple as being able to loan somebody a game or being able to sell it back and all this stuff but there's something to be said now in this day and age about the convenience because these games are so large about having the game just fired up up there on screen ready to go and
8340840	8357581	and I think what's most important and what's going to need to really continue to be important especially in the console space because it's already true in the gaming space if I, or in the PC space excuse me, if I upgrade my PC or whatever computer I'm using, if I upgrade my computer my Steam library carries with me and I can play everything on Steam on that new
8358522	8359243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8382404	8386527	I think there will, you know, and I know you kind of addressed it talking about like the minority.
8386587	8399495	I think just like the fact that Target sells vinyl records now, I feel like there is always going to be a space for physical, but I understand that like, especially as the cloud and, you know...
8400496	8404817	for better or for worse, AI computing on the fly, especially cloud-based.
8404917	8409319	Well, it's where the industry is going, whether we like it or not, to get some of these higher-end graphics.
8409719	8414160	But we'll say cloud-based processing is going to kind of force more things to be digital.
8414620	8417081	And so I understand that.
8417121	8424583	But at the same time, there's that flip side I just talked about that I talked about earlier in the show that's always going to be in the back of people's minds.
8424923	8428284	Are the corporate gremlins going to sneak into my house overnight and take my digital copy away from me?
8430353	8452496	removal like PT being the obviously like stand out significant what the fuck scenario is the extreme example and hundreds of them happen year over year because of ties because of server side ties that don't need to be a thing but they were designed to be that way
8454421	8460823	TigerClaw does point out, and he's not wrong, that one of the main reasons things are going digital is that physical media doesn't last forever.
8460883	8462184	It's going to eventually break down.
8463324	8464585	Especially the older games.
8465505	8468366	Back when they were cartridges, that shit was built to last.
8468566	8475009	But do you really think that these companies are going to be saving their games on their servers once they get old?
8475049	8480851	Maybe you'll be lucky to have some source code that might be preserved that's not available for public consumption.
8480871	8481171	Yeah.
8482032	8487256	On one hand, to that end, on one hand, the Giga leak went back decades.
8488317	8495763	On the other hand, Square, or whomever is most responsible, lost, had to rebuild Kingdom Hearts entirely.
8495843	8503469	So, like, yes, if people, if companies are mindful enough to do it, but no, because accidents happen and things go wrong.
8503489	8504250	Yeah.
8504790	8516774	Well, and on the server front, there's also the could there possibly in our lifetime in the next few years be regulation that regulates some sort of longevity to these online games?
8516834	8521936	Because I'll tell you what, that whole Ubisoft story we just covered is them running in fear of that.
8523592	8534098	Yes, and again, to the same extent, I am 100% in support of legislation to keep things working that go in people's hands.
8535039	8546506	Like Stadia, Stadia refunding all of the game license fees and ultimately keeping all the subscription fees was a huge positive deal for consumers.
8548067	8551729	I got refunded for my Founders Kit, my controller and Chromecast.
8552049	8553491	DarkSakura has some thoughts on that.
8554533	8569492	Yeah, well, and all of that money that got me first class back and forth to Alabama when my mom was in the hospital and then having to redo all of my freaking Dead by Daylight achievements and having to, after three months, rebuy all my DLC.
8571245	8599126	I think and it's one of the being a little bit more business minded now and less blanket anarchist which is a very weird situation to find myself in mentally like I do believe that a well run company is going to continuously plan for the exit I don't know how many do I don't know if any of the companies I've ever worked with plan for the exit that's only a thing as far as I know that's only a thing legislatively and like
8599746	8604849	There's the BP cleanup related story is kind of the only thing I can remember in that world.
8605309	8623378	I think companies, when they have released media, released product, like stake in people's hands, it needs to be able to be allowed to be, it needs to be made to be permanent because it's not yours anymore when it's in other people's hands.
8623918	8625659	You are making something for people.
8625919	8628121	That is such a fascinating point you just brought up.
8628161	8630083	And I just kind of want to highlight that.
8630163	8634386	Plan for the exit is something that we don't really see gaming companies do.
8634727	8636869	But when they do it, it's almost infamous.
8636929	8640472	It's almost the things of legend that buys a lot of trust.
8640612	8642333	And my case in point is Valve.
8642734	8647818	I think the most popular and well-known in the industry plan for the exit is the Steam button.
8648479	8650601	Everybody knows that Steam has a button.
8651081	8660048	And if Valve ever closes their doors, what that button's going to do is it's going to open up all of the games you own on Steam to be DRM free and no longer require Steam.
8660768	8663790	I'm fascinated by hearing about that.
8664051	8666632	I remember reading that article however many years ago.
8666712	8668594	I'm fascinated by that and want to know more.
8669074	8676061	Somebody might know, but they're not going to blast the EMP to do absolutely crazy things.
8676122	8677743	But yeah, that is a great example.
8678204	8686733	That has come up in conversation for a company that has been the dominant PC distributor for 20 years now?
8686753	8686973	Mm-hmm.
8687333	8702988	But there is, I think, a mentality that goes with just about any business that people don't, and maybe it's a point of too much pride or what have you, but they don't think that their business isn't going to outlive them.
8703328	8703989	Oh, absolutely.
8704289	8706251	Oh, this is going to be forever.
8706271	8707352	We can't possibly fail.
8707392	8708053	We're in the lead.
8709107	8710389	We're making money hand over fist.
8710409	8712532	Why plan for something that isn't going to happen?
8712612	8716918	Because as the saying goes, gravity works.
8719935	8723437	I prefer the version that's Gravity Sucks, which is said in jest, of course.
8723457	8724378	I prefer the ban.
8724398	8725339	Gravity kills.
8726419	8727160	Must come down.
8728901	8730762	Jason, good shit, as always.
8730923	8733264	I really appreciate your perspective on this show.
8733644	8734505	Thank you for calling in.
8734525	8742571	And again, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you for everything you do to keep OLR a record-running podcast at this point.
8743371	8744712	Round of applause to all of us!
8744772	8748653	Round of applause every chat!
8748974	8750434	Alright, Jason, thanks a bunch.
8750474	8751194	We'll talk to you next time.
8751995	8752875	Hear us in two weeks.
8753235	8753816	Yep, two weeks.
8754076	8754376	See you then.
8756397	8757637	Alright, thanks Jason for that.
8757677	8758398	Appreciate that.
8759078	8762760	With that, I think we are ready to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.
8763300	8765721	Thank you so much for everybody for listening.
8765921	8769162	Actually, I realized I need to check in with Loki for any last minute stories.
8769202	8770363	We actually have had kind of a
8771854	8773256	Visier week than usual.
8775458	8785809	Uh... Yeah, the last minute story, so I don't know what this is gonna be, but so I decided, um, when we were talking about, like, um...
8786966	8791628	I remember when we were talking about like publishing and stuff like that with Annapurna Interactive and stuff like that.
8792028	8795790	Maybe it reminded me, oh yeah, I should probably check my HIO to see if I have sold anything.
8796430	8799152	I haven't, you know, because no one's purchased it.
8799432	8803874	However, I have a note or a comment.
8804654	8809358	from 72 days ago, because I, once again, I don't check my account very often.
8810059	8813402	And it says, I discovered and played this tonight.
8813422	8815423	I went in with low expectations, but this is brilliant.
8815563	8816765	How can we get in touch?
8816865	8819587	I'd like to publish a physical version of the game for you.
8819647	8824972	It's a company called, it's ITGsoft out of Taiwan.
8825552	8851044	well look into it and make sure it's legit because I could also see that you know and I do not know this company so this is not shade it's just reality make sure it's legit and not a scamming thing because you know but of course if it is legit then fucking good for you and how fucking funny that you I almost missed the Guinness thing because I don't fucking read Twitter and you did miss this because you don't read Twitch.io laughing
8852169	8853350	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8853410	8856171	So, um, we'll see.
8856951	8863574	I see that there's, like, some other folks that have worked with them in the community, so I just said, hey, what's going on?
8864154	8864715	What is this?
8864815	8866655	You know, like, is this legit or not?
8867156	8874219	I prefer to publish to Retroverse, but they're not up and ready to go, and I don't know how long it's going to take them to do that.
8874399	8875539	I still want to see you on Evercade.
8875759	8877120	I still want to see you on Evercade.
8877140	8877720	Yeah, that would be cool.
8877760	8878921	I don't know if that's ever going to happen.
8879321	8879581	Alright.
8880414	8883575	Well, I think I have to reach out to them, though, to do that.
8883655	8884035	You should.
8884095	8884455	You should.
8884495	8884976	I can ask.
8885856	8887436	I hope you make another NES game someday.
8887476	8887857	I really do.
8887977	8888257	All right.
8888617	8889377	I know it's a lot of work.
8889417	8893778	It's easy for me to sit here and say, go ye to work, Loki, and make me a game.
8893879	8895619	But it's a lot of work.
8895719	8897220	So, you know, I want to respect that, too.
8897320	8904082	But I'm glad somebody's fucking giving you the kudos you deserve.
8905148	8905948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8921517	8923880	I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight.
8923920	8924541	Thank you, thank you.
8924941	8928265	And, you know, can't say it enough tonight, especially in light of the big news this week.
8928606	8934513	Thank you for all the support you've given us over the years, whether this was your first week or your 1017th week.
8934853	8935935	Thank you so much for being here.
8936055	8936916	It really means the world.
8937216	8940038	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
8940098	8944941	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
8945721	8953846	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show, go an awful long way, and we appreciate them all.
8954287	8957529	With that, we're going to go around and get some final thoughts.
8958349	8959570	Have fun at TwitchCon, gang.
8960010	8962992	I'm really sorry I can't be there, but I think you guys are going to have a great time.
8963372	8964893	DarkSakura, I know you're streaming tonight.
8964993	8965974	You got a final thought for us.
8967148	8967788	Lights out.
8968729	8969309	All right, have fun.
8970169	8971990	And I will have a Shayla with me.
8972631	8972991	Oh, good.
8974732	8975672	All right, we'll see you all soon.
8975712	8977393	I'll try to lurk after I get the podcast up.
8978593	8979254	Lurk and twerk.
8979414	8981695	All right, I will, except I won't be sharing the twerking.
8981755	8982035	All right.
8983256	8983696	Bye.
8983736	8983896	Bye.
8984796	8985577	Loki, how about you?
8985997	8986777	Final thought for us tonight?
8988278	8990499	Big week this week, so look forward to it.
8992806	9000271	My final thought is I'm looking forward to my little trip to Seattle and the Ingress competition that's happening up there.
9000391	9009377	But even if we were to lose it horrifically, which we won't, but you never know, I'm still just excited to go to Seattle and see my buddies up there, to be honest.
9009737	9011138	So it's going to be a fun personal trip for me.
9012299	9013659	Have fun, everybody who's going to TwitchCon.
9013679	9016862	I'm sorry to miss it this year, but Alan and I will try to get back there next year.
9018443	9019403	We just needed a year off.
9019583	9021505	After all the walking in Vegas last year,
9022265	9026746	and the near panic attack I had on the monorail in Vegas, we needed a year off.
9026826	9029946	I'm glad they moved it back to San Diego and holy fuck, I hope they keep it there.
9031647	9032707	But we'll see.
9032827	9033127	Oh, good.
9033587	9038708	I took the precautions yesterday to get my shots so that I don't bring home con crud.
9038768	9040128	So hopefully, you know, for you.
9040168	9041529	Yeah, I hope you don't get convid.
9042249	9043449	That's that's no fun at all.
9043529	9045429	But yeah, good for you taking those precautions.
9045829	9047930	Now I can't get it for three months.
9048570	9051774	because you don't get the shot after you've had a positive COVID case.
9051794	9056198	But the silver lining is that I'll get it just in time for the cruise next year.
9056519	9058061	Oh, you don't do that?
9058281	9058641	Oh, well.
9060043	9063467	You're not supposed to have the shot if you already had COVID within the past three months.
9064588	9064788	Oops.
9067774	9069535	Wah, wah, wah.
9069795	9070155	That's all right.
9071015	9071416	I don't know.
9071496	9073376	I don't think there's a downside to it.
9073416	9079159	I'm just, I don't know if it's like less effective or I think maybe the thought process is you don't need it because you already have the immunity.
9079559	9080099	But I don't know.
9082768	9083489	Ask your doctor.
9083629	9084649	I'm not a fucking doctor.
9085190	9086551	We're going to end on that note tonight.
9086891	9087871	I'm not a fucking doctor.
9088011	9089192	And we'll see you in two weeks.
9090313	9092374	Have a great two weeks, everybody.
9092394	9093214	We'll see you next time.
9093495	9095476	Have fun with Bobby Blackwolf Live next week.
9095796	9096636	We'll see you next time.
9097037	9097857	Happy TwitchCon.
