1
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:10,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't watch a lot of movies.

2
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't avoid them.

3
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:12,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I just end up not seeing them.

4
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:23,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite that, I feel like I've been continually aware of Jack Black's roles, as far back as his supporting role in Enemy of the State, to his back-to-back-to-back roles in video game movies that you, and even those that aren't in gaming culture, probably know at least two of the three.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Jack Black's effort, and his beard.

6
00:00:27,472 --> 00:00:29,053
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Rose-Tinted Glasses intro.

7
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:33,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about why Jack Black is relevant to gaming news.

8
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice...

9
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:47,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:59,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back tonight, September the 8th of 2024 with episode number 1016 of our show.

12
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:07,863
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back after a week off for the Labor Day holiday, and I was at Dragon Con, and I'm sure my co-hosts were up to no good as well.

13
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:08,483
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

14
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:32,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the best and full of energy and perky!

15
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to hear it, me too!

16
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, us!

17
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:40,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is also a lie, but I'll get through tonight.

18
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:44,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, in all seriousness, I hope you feel better.

19
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:45,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

20
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:47,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also not feeling great.

21
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:51,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I caught Convid, Conronavirus, what have you.

22
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:55,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, a lot of people are going to be like, you idiot.

23
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens when you go to a big convention with a lot of people is you're going to be exposed to that.

24
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,215
[SPEAKER_04]: My answer is, I know.

25
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:12,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a risk, but the reality is my mental health after coming out of that convention, holy shit, I had an incredible, amazing, wonderful year.

26
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:18,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sucks that I got the big C, but you'll notice my symptoms are in pretty good shape.

27
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You left with 19 crows, you know, COVID-19.

28
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:20,618
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, COVID-19.

29
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really only the fatigue at this point.

30
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,400
[SPEAKER_04]: E3VL is asking, were you bedridden?

31
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:29,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

32
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:33,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to minimize it because I know it's worse for other people.

33
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:37,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And disclaimer, I had Paxilvid, and Paxilvid started to act really fast.

34
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really just like sniffles, sore throat, the flu.

35
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:51,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I know ironically in the beginning we weren't supposed to say it was just a flu, but with drugs and stuff and this far into things, it was very reminiscent of the flu.

36
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:54,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Just this nasty fatigue thing going on.

37
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's the weird thing about it.

38
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan did not get sick.

39
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby did not get sick.

40
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else we were hanging out with the entire time got sick.

41
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,272
[SPEAKER_04]: But just kind of looking at the various discords.

42
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a discord for digital media.

43
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:10,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a discord for video games.

44
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:13,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, overall, again, I'm not trying to minimize the risk.

45
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:20,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, as I see on the stats, yeah, it's way less people than got it at 2022 and 2023.

46
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:24,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just lucky, yay, that I got it.

47
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:29,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would say it's less than five in both of those servers.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's one small sampling of a much bigger population.

49
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure there's other people...

50
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:54,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your shots, take precautions, do what you need to do But I'm just saying, it does seem like it's not quite the effect it was a couple years ago My friend Annie came back with it from Stuff Mom Never Told You Oh, was she at DragonCon too?

51
00:03:55,137 --> 00:04:03,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she was Disco Luke Oh, how fun As in a specific German interview Mm-hmm, mm-hmm

52
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:05,970
[SPEAKER_07]: and the sequined Luke Skywalker.

53
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:07,872
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

54
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:08,672
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fun.

55
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wish I'd seen them.

56
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:13,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if she brought Winter Soldier this year.

57
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:16,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't ask, but I know Disco Luke was the big one.

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,582
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, there's been a COVID surge lately.

59
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:19,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

60
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you didn't go, you could have gotten in at the store for 15 minutes.

61
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy your life to the fullest.

62
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where my brain is at.

63
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

64
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,149
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just...

65
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,350
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

66
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:49,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

67
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:51,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Peachy Keen Jellybean, to quote one of my friends.

68
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:52,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I like that.

69
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:54,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a good Labor Day weekend?

70
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:55,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Long weekend?

71
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:59,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get a chance to work on more Minecraft videos?

72
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

73
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember when I put up the last one.

74
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the week before?

75
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:06,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

76
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:07,539
[SPEAKER_03]: The time is...

77
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:09,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're kicking no one down.

78
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:10,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

79
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:45,139
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's more footage from the game than I ever wish to play.

80
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,559
[SPEAKER_03]: The game that you will never play.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I don't know if they're ever going to bring it back.

82
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into that in a little bit.

83
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could see them retooling it and re-releasing it.

84
00:05:56,687 --> 00:06:00,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was, let's see, yeah, so it would have launched, it was on the 23rd that it launched.

85
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:00,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

86
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,917
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think we talked about it's really pitiful numbers that it had.

87
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, we did.

88
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

89
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,820
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about that on Steam, but we didn't know how it was performing on PlayStation.

90
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,481
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the whole thing.

91
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently not well.

92
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:32,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

93
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so apparently it wasn't doing well.

94
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:37,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It peaked.

95
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:45,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It was around like 700 or so players on Steam and then only went down from there.

96
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:54,794
[SPEAKER_03]: and so Sony and I guess Firewalk, I'm going to say it's more on the Sony side, decided that they're going to pull it offline.

97
00:06:55,675 --> 00:07:02,298
[SPEAKER_03]: They took it down on September 6th and essentially refunded everybody for the game.

98
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:03,499
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

99
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: you know we've seen games that get taken down after a year like Babylon's Fall or something but they don't they don't get refunded because at least they were up for a year or whatever but two weeks that that would be a hard one if there were to be a class action or something behind that it is probably the shortest amount of time for a AAA game not the shortest amount of time ever though for a live service game because that was that scam game that was I think earlier this year last year so there was that one but

100
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:51,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then there was Cyberpunk, but they also didn't refund that.

101
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And they always had the intention to bring that back.

102
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:57,079
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pulling it to address critical things.

103
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a different circumstance.

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was only on the PlayStation platform, so it wasn't on every platform.

105
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one you're talking about was something, too.

106
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:09,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a sequel, but it was like... I know what you're talking about.

107
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a sequel, or maybe it was.

108
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:12,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

109
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a scam.

110
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,553
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing was a scam, essentially.

111
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:25,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point by Tigerclaw in chat as well is that the PC version of Cyberpunk was not affected in all of that mess.

112
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only the console stuff.

113
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:44,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So, according to a blog post that they had on, so a few days before they pulled the servers, they shared on their blog that, you know, Concord fans, we've been listening to you closely and to your feedback since launch of the Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC.

114
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:51,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, too bad you didn't listen to us beforehand when we said that this was a terrible idea and it was going to bomb really hard, but...

115
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,946
[SPEAKER_03]: You try it anyways.

116
00:08:55,467 --> 00:09:00,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Without sounding like, you know, every other cynical gamer out there, can we take a deep dive?

117
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's refresh.

118
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:01,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

119
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:03,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were we warning them it was going to bomb?

120
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So a few things.

121
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:10,078
[SPEAKER_03]: One, price point was a factor.

122
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:20,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was competing against games that essentially are free to play, but it was charging a $40 price point and still monetizing like a free to play game.

123
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:20,986
[SPEAKER_04]: FOMESTARS

124
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

125
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:41,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

126
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

127
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:22,121
[SPEAKER_04]: it's fine you know and that game probably could have done a lot better if the AI thing hadn't been sandbagging it because I'm telling you that turned a lot of people off from the game and that's going to continue to turn people off I guarantee it people but anyway that's that's another Concord didn't have the AI problem so yeah Concord didn't

128
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't have the AI problem.

129
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:37,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the whole draw that they were marketing it as is supposed to have interesting characters, which, to be fair, the characters felt like a knockoff of Guardians of the Galaxy.

130
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it just felt like a knockoff of it.

131
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And so right then, you didn't have people that were interested in these characters.

132
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:52,362
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't interested in these lore, storyline, cinematics that you said that you were going to produce every single week.

133
00:10:54,242 --> 00:11:02,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The gameplay itself was alright, because it did have veteran developers from other games like Destiny and stuff working on that.

134
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:06,066
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem was... Yeah, this doesn't look like I'm watching it being played behind you here.

135
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:06,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah?

136
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:07,186
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

137
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:27,126
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing I thought Matt still was saying something I'm sorry I have one more thing yeah so the problem was though they also had some weird like gameplay um mechanics in there as well so like for example they would have it where you couldn't play the same character over and over in certain game types which is kind of weird um

138
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,120
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

139
00:11:52,402 --> 00:12:20,864
[SPEAKER_03]: it's competing against Overwatch but Overwatch has interesting characters with interesting abilities whereas these characters aren't interesting and their abilities are kind of weird they're not necessarily interesting either and so that was kind of the uphill battle that they were facing and yeah I mean I think it should have been looked at a little bit closer they probably didn't think that it was going to bomb this hard though obviously if they pushed it forward

140
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to mention a minute ago, watching the gameplay behind you, this doesn't look particularly bad.

141
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like the graphics are kind of nice and it looks very fluid.

142
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:37,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to chop up this kind of choppy frame rate I see to more what we're getting over Discord and the relay than the game itself.

143
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably runs a pretty smooth 60.

144
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,875
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I notice about it is that I've seen this game a lot of times.

145
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:52,619
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's a big part of the problem when you're asking $40 for it is that it does look pretty generic.

146
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say it.

147
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what else I think is a really like...

148
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,593
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

149
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:29,443
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the number one reason, if you know, what is the number one reason people dislike Overwatch 2 versus Overwatch 1?

150
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:35,669
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the number one thing they changed from Overwatch 1 to Overwatch 2 people don't like?

151
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So much so that they're looking at doing like an experimental mode to bring this back into Overwatch 2.

152
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:45,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the 5v5 versus 4v4?

153
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:45,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding, ding, ding.

154
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:47,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 5v5 versus 6v6.

155
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:48,829
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

156
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough, E3VL.

157
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,252
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other reasons too, but I see as far as the game mechanics, because E3VL mentions Battle Pass.

158
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,054
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fair, because it transitions to free-to-play and so forth.

159
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:03,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact that they went from 6v6 to 5v5.

160
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So why, if you're listening to what the community doesn't like about your competitors...

161
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:19,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you then release a 5v5 shooter when that's the thing that people don't like about Overwatch 2 versus the original Overwatch?

162
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had made it a 6v6 shooter and they could have had a whole campaign around, come on back to 6v6 play.

163
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:29,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on back to the most entertaining 6v6 game on the market.

164
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or things like that.

165
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:31,975
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a stretch.

166
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, you know what I'm getting at, right?

167
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:38,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It just feels very like they really just didn't do the work

168
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:48,444
[SPEAKER_04]: to see, and the programmers did their job, the graphic people did their job, the artists did their job, but the people who designed it didn't really do their job, in my opinion.

169
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the level designs, like, they're very plain.

170
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:59,288
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to be going to all these different planets, but they all look like some industrial corridor shooter thing, which is kind of annoying.

171
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:08,972
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, but yeah, like, even from the outset, when they announced it, the announcement trailer with the cinematic, which is supposed to get you hyped about it, people are just like, eh.

172
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:10,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I'm good.

173
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't very exciting.

174
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:26,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I could say a good example of a game like this that did have, I think, the hype behind it just because of the trailer and what they showed gameplay-wise would have been... Oh gosh, I just had it in an...

175
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:30,773
[SPEAKER_03]: The Finals was a good one.

176
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that one, like, I got excited about that game.

177
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to play it, but I got it.

178
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an exciting trailer.

179
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:38,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, wow, that looks really cool.

180
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:44,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, when I saw the cinematics for this, I'm like, wow, no, I don't want to play this.

181
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:48,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play Guardians of the Galaxy instead, but I don't want to play this.

182
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to play this type of thing.

183
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:57,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if this was like a Guardians of the Galaxy game, where they're like, you know, like an arena shooter like that, that...

184
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:24,257
[SPEAKER_04]: could be cool ironically Loki Mike Deft in chat mentions we have something like Marvel Rivals which would be close enough to what you're talking about coming later in the year and that game got quite the reception on their latest beta absolutely a lot of streamer pals were streaming that Marvel Rivals beta those that could get into it doesn't bode well for all that talk of you can never seem to launch something that doesn't tie in as a sequel or something with an existing IP but

185
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it is what it is, right?

186
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:33,122
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's why Marvel Rivals is kind of getting attention too, is that it's, you know, Overwatch, but Marvel.

187
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:39,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, as Joe and Hunter Matt also says, they also developed this for eight years.

188
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:44,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when they started Overwatch was the hot game when shooters weren't as prevalent.

189
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Now 5v5 hero shooters are all over the place.

190
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a long dev cycle hurt this thing.

191
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:58,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Quest Buster in chat says, I'll be honest, when I first saw the reveal trailer, I was kind of excited for what I thought was going to be a looter shooter with a Guardians-like vibe.

192
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:02,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they said 5v5 team shooter, I lost all interest.

193
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:09,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe once again, people kind of wanting a PvE element or something else in it, not getting it and deciding to do a pass.

194
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: E3VL brings up an interesting game that launched recently that's doing much different than this.

195
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: E3VL mentions Deadlock.

196
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:19,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Deadlock Deadlock Deadlock

197
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:44,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, Deadlock is a little more MOBA vibe into it.

198
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:51,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you can quite call it Overwatch, but there's definitely like Overwatch meets Dota.

199
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,650
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's very, you know, kind of that whole thing is what that game is.

200
00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, maybe it's just the fact that, oh my God, Valve is doing a game because...

201
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:24,331
[SPEAKER_04]: the characters in Deadlock are original characters you know and they're fine they're cool they're Valve characters it's just but it's but there's so many more people that care about Deadlock versus this game it's just interesting right but Deadlock's also free so so yeah that's the thing like a free play like I don't think this would have been a big deal if it was well first off you'd have more people playing it

202
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:26,495
[SPEAKER_03]: if it was free to play.

203
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:29,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just the $40 price point.

204
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:33,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy into it, and it's like, oh, there's no one playing.

205
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:40,747
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have known, though, because they had 25,000 sales from that, or even pre-orders.

206
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:43,249
[SPEAKER_03]: They had very few pre-orders for this game.

207
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, don't you see the writing on the wall?

208
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:47,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe delay it?

209
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Delay a bit, and

210
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:53,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

211
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:54,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were hopeful that it would do better.

212
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:57,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the $40 was the problem.

213
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:58,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the biggest problem.

214
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:19,672
[SPEAKER_04]: The article that should come out is that vice presidents and above at this studio were all let go this week, and the staff under them were transferred to XYZ Studio under Sony.

215
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And this studio is no more.

216
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the story I would want to see.

217
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,740
[SPEAKER_04]: If the studio is going to close, that's not going to be – we all know.

218
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that's not the reality.

219
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:37,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the studio doesn't close next week, I would assume that this game will be relaunched as a PlayStation Plus free thing.

220
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:44,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to look at a different way to try to monetize it, which hopefully is a little better than what they tried.

221
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not pay for those discs.

222
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:52,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because people are saying, oh, this is a hot collector item, you'll never be able to play this game, da-da-da.

223
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Sony writes this off completely.

224
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:02,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it does come back, and essentially all those discs are going to do are ping the server to download the new game now.

225
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:09,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, I guess you could always have an offline copy of it, but it doesn't do you much good when it's an offline game.

226
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say, technically, I don't think it does anything.

227
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:14,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't play the game offline.

228
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think those discs are really worth much, so you can go track one down if you want, but yeah, I don't know about that.

229
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Phila9 says they should add a Glenn Close cosmetic.

230
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom, game fixed.

231
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:33,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you joke, but maybe it's all they have to do is put a Sony character in it.

232
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Put Kratos in space.

233
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:36,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

234
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:37,473
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is this.

235
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Aloy in space.

236
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have character?

237
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:43,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Astro Bot with guns.

238
00:20:45,295 --> 00:21:00,690
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah it's I mean talk about Astro Bot you know meanwhile you've got this going on over here on the other hand Sony puts out Astro Bot this week I don't know if any of you have had a chance to check it out I haven't checked it out myself I don't know PlayStation 5 I'll play it when it comes to PC if ever

239
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:07,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But literally game of the year, unironic game of the year discussions going on with Astro Bot right now.

240
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:08,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that good, apparently.

241
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:13,760
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the platformer Sony has always needed.

242
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,540
[SPEAKER_03]: They need a mascot character.

243
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and honestly, the Astro Bot VR game was pretty decent.

244
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:21,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of not surprised to hear this.

245
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess I am surprised how loud...

246
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,827
[SPEAKER_04]: People are about, nope, Astro Bot.

247
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,187
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the game of the year right here.

248
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:32,709
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it.

249
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:36,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting that Sony does it in the scope of two weeks.

250
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:41,214
[SPEAKER_04]: They launched the biggest flop and what may be the biggest success story of the year.

251
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:42,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

252
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:44,697
[SPEAKER_03]: The duality of man.

253
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: SHO and Hunter Matt in chat says, Concord, California is just happy they're the best Concord this week.

254
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:52,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Forever and always.

255
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:53,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

256
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:54,778
[SPEAKER_03]: The queues are shut down.

257
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:55,259
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

258
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of our little intro bumper fake things a few weeks ago.

259
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,021
[SPEAKER_04]: The Concord queues are shut down.

260
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get a t-shirt from there before they closed.

261
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm glad.

262
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:03,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

263
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have one.

264
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:06,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a bit small, though.

265
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:13,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, yeah, it is technically the last one, not to change subjects, because S.T.A.R.S.

266
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: in Vacaville does not have queues there anymore.

267
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:19,511
[SPEAKER_03]: They have another system now, which I gotta go check out, because it looks pretty cool.

268
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:19,691
[SPEAKER_03]: But

269
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:21,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm kind of over it.

270
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:24,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, QZAR's been, like, bankrupt and out of business for, like, years.

271
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:26,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm surprised that there's any still around.

272
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:34,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And even the one that Concord had was, like, it was a brand new Q system that I've never played before, so it probably wouldn't have felt the same anyways.

273
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:38,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, it is what it is.

274
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology gets better.

275
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:41,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, everything can't be done over radio nowadays.

276
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:44,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's got to be Bluetooth and stuff, because that makes sense.

277
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you can't run off of, like...

278
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,389
[SPEAKER_03]: God, those computers are so old.

279
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,131
[SPEAKER_03]: DOS.

280
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:51,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they ran off DOS.

281
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:53,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they were that old.

282
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just an old system.

283
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:55,584
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do?

284
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:57,352
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do?

285
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:57,853
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

286
00:22:58,473 --> 00:22:59,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on.

287
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:08,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk to, before we get to our gaming weeks, I have another little piece for our kickoff tonight, and that is to talk about something kind of big that happened in the week we weren't here.

288
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:15,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a Nintendo Direct that happened when we weren't here, and there was a lot that they announced as a part of this Direct.

289
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll quickly go through and talk about some of the headlines from this.

290
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:22,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'll mention everything, but there's some things that definitely caught my eye.

291
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:23,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about y'all.

292
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:50,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yakuza Kiwami going to be released on the Nintendo Switch will finally come out in October Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma also coming out on the Switch as well as the Legends of Heroes Trails in the Sky that is a remake that's going to be coming out for the Nintendo Switch pretty cool this is the one I think caught lots of people's eye I'm curious DarkSakura if it caught your eye because this is up your alley Castlevania Dominus Collection

293
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,704
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great that we got this because this is all the DS games Dan and I talked about it Yeah?

294
00:23:58,164 --> 00:24:14,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So we weren't really so much into the DS games Interesting, okay The thing on there that really interested us the most, especially Dan, is the remake of Haunted Castle Yes, a little bonus thrown in, yeah

295
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:24,079
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched a little bit of it and then started discussing, you know, like what platform might we want this on or, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

296
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:28,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, well, I'd really want an arcade stick to play this with, so Switch wouldn't really work.

297
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:32,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we were just sort of going back and forth about it.

298
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:36,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, yeah, I could get it on Steam.

299
00:24:36,364 --> 00:24:37,485
[SPEAKER_07]: That wouldn't be a problem.

300
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:40,966
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was very cool.

301
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll absolutely give it that.

302
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:43,288
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

303
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,264
[SPEAKER_07]: In the cards.

304
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really unexpected, actually.

305
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:54,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think they would try to port the DS games to the modern consoles.

306
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really exciting, honestly.

307
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:57,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I will check this.

308
00:24:58,035 --> 00:25:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I've had a pretty busy week, but this is on my radar to check out.

309
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,423
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on PlayStation 5 and I believe Xbox as well, question mark.

310
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll probably pick it up on PS5 for sure because I think that'll be really fun.

311
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:19,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and the other thing, though, for us is that, I mean, in the big picture, we've got TwitchCon coming up and, you know, adulting to do.

312
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, good point.

313
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,683
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't be here in two weeks because TwitchCon, so it's a FYI.

314
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:27,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, exactly.

315
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, kind of out of the blue, was a game that Konami had announced a couple years ago and then it disappeared.

316
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster confirmed.

317
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:45,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is it coming to the Switch, we know this is multi-platform, but it was a Nintendo's event.

318
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:47,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally have a date of March 6, 2025.

319
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:56,056
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is now fully called Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster Gate Dawn and Dunan Unification Wars.

320
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:15,284
[SPEAKER_04]: you will also be able to speed up combat in the game kind of like you can in like the Final Fantasy 12 and 10 remasters they did which I think is really great and there's going to be an auto battle button so that's really cool this is fucking huge in my opinion this is why I'm like no we're going back to talk about last week I'm sorry

321
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:37,148
[SPEAKER_04]: This Capcom Fighting Collection 2, DarkSakura, again, surely your ears must have perked up at the fact that this Capcom Fighting Collection 2 has Capcom versus SNK 1 and 2, Project Justice, hello, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and Power Stone 2.

322
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:39,589
[SPEAKER_04]: This is incredible.

323
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it also has Power Stone 1 as well, right?

324
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, these are just some of the highlights.

325
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's got like 10 games in it.

326
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:47,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely on the agenda.

327
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:50,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is... Love me some Power Stone.

328
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on the Switch, PS4, PC.

329
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:55,302
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about the Xbox version later.

330
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out on Xbox, but it's delayed a little bit.

331
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:05,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd honestly love to see just like a completely updated SD edition of Project Justice.

332
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:06,127
Yeah.

333
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:07,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be beautiful.

334
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:13,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tensia points out that Street Fighter Alpha 3 is the Naomi upgrade with more characters.

335
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:14,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very cool.

336
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:17,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, honestly, that was the...

337
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:18,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Naomi.

338
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Naomi.

339
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:27,827
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the jaw-dropping announcement of everything at this Direct for me, honestly, when they haven't even released the Marvel one yet.

340
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:37,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd also be really fun to have Power Stone back just for those knockdown battles that we used to have over at my house on the Dreamcast.

341
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:37,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

342
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still surprised they haven't announced a new Power Stone.

343
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:42,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is going to be testing the waters for that?

344
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:43,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

345
00:27:44,009 --> 00:28:09,515
[SPEAKER_07]: well I think that's where all those polls were coming in because they were going to be doing this collection like I got the last the collection that had Red Earth in it and that one I like so this makes me happy now here's a genuine question because I don't know because I haven't seen anything in the arcades they don't Capcom doesn't do arcade ports of like their Street Fighter games anymore right?

346
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:19,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Perfect Ports Arcade versions of their Street Fighter games Street Fighter 6 is an arcade game, right?

347
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:27,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did Street Fighter 6 had an arcade release I don't ever see it in the arcade so that's why I asked I thought it was

348
00:28:28,431 --> 00:28:29,152
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is.

349
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:34,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I think Loki is more referring to this problem that it's arcades have nothing but ticket spitters.

350
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:37,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be at the right arcade to actually find a Street Fighter 6.

351
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,740
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem.

352
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:41,503
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think probably around 1, you might find one.

353
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:48,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, didn't we play, like, the ones that was the test models that were at TwitchCon a couple years ago?

354
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: They had, like...

355
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:55,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they may have been Xbox Ones with arcade stick setups.

356
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know now.

357
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,909
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people in chat confirming there's arcade release.

358
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,830
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in candy cabs in Japan, says Bubby Blackwolf.

359
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:09,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, by the way, since we keep talking about what's in this, here's the full list of games in that Capcom Fighting Collection 2.

360
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom vs. SNK 1 and 2.

361
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:14,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom Fighting Evolution.

362
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper.

363
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:24,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Justice, Power Stone 1, Power Stone 2, and Plasma Sword, Nightmare of Girl Style is also in this.

364
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can play online, of course.

365
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:31,320
[SPEAKER_04]: There's training localized in 14 languages with a museum.

366
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:36,062
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucking rad, honestly.

367
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:43,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't even really get into fighting games anymore that often, but like you had me at Capcom versus SNK 2.

368
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:44,046
[SPEAKER_04]: You had me at that.

369
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Power Stone on top of that?

370
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,227
[SPEAKER_01]: One and two?

371
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:49,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinch me!

372
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:53,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also part of the Nintendo Direct.

373
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:54,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Five Nights at Freddy's games!

374
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:58,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of didn't realize all of these weren't already on the Switch, but sure.

375
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Help 1 and 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch, and then Security Breach is coming.

376
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of Five Nights at Freddy's coming out as well.

377
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Tales of Grace's F Remastered is coming out.

378
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:10,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

379
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:11,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I say this right.

380
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Bellatro?

381
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:13,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the name of this game?

382
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:14,028
[SPEAKER_04]: That card game?

383
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:14,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

384
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That everybody's talking about?

385
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:15,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played this.

386
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:16,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it on Steam.

387
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:16,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet.

388
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it fun?

389
00:30:17,671 --> 00:30:18,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious.

390
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, a lot of people I know are kind of addicted to this.

391
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:21,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Nick playing it a lot.

392
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick really likes it.

393
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to check this out.

394
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bellatro is coming out on Switch, obviously, is what I'm talking about here.

395
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:31,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're also teaming up with... Actually, I think it might already be on Switch.

396
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: The news is that they're teaming up with The Witcher 3, Vampire Survivors, and Among Us.

397
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:38,908
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be themed decks with it.

398
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:40,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe...

399
00:30:40,609 --> 00:31:07,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm crossing wires in my mind because I think they also announced this for mobile recently I think that's why my brain is going it's coming out on Switch no it's coming out on mobile and they announced the expansion stuff during the Nintendo event so I'm gonna have to check this out because everybody seems to be really into it that I know this I thought was interesting because you know I love me some Civilization Civilization 7 is coming to the Nintendo Switch at launch on February 11th 2025 and you know what that tells me

400
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:12,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Graphics are not going to be cutting edge in this game, apparently.

401
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Graphics aren't the most important thing.

402
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:15,933
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

403
00:31:15,953 --> 00:31:17,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't play Civ 7 for the graphics.

404
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:18,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been nice.

405
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't play Civ 7.

406
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,479
[SPEAKER_07]: You play to conquer the world.

407
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,540
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you play, right?

408
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:26,102
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

409
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:26,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

410
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:30,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I play so I can actually be the Queen of England for a day.

411
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

412
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Are y'all ready for Power Wash Simulator to get Shrek DLC?

413
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:38,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

414
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:39,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can power.

415
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:41,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't just have to get out of the swamp.

416
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:42,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can power wash it.

417
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:50,100
[SPEAKER_03]: You almost think you'd feel like, you know, because it is Shrek that you should be like spraying mud on things.

418
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It should go the other way around, don't you think?

419
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,104
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're spraying glitter or you're spraying off glitter.

420
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:56,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that works.

421
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:01,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea of Stars got a new trailer for the Throws of the Watchmaker DLC.

422
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:03,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you folks love your Sea of Stars.

423
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:04,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

424
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So that DLC is coming soon.

425
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:12,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in the coming soon department, the Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake.

426
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:15,410
[SPEAKER_04]: That is being released on November 14th.

427
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That is very exciting as well.

428
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:22,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Goat Simulator 3 was shadow dropped on Switch.

429
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:25,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't have Goat Simulator 3 yet, you can check that out on the Switch.

430
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:26,375
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

431
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:50,576
[SPEAKER_04]: They let Tetris and the 40th anniversary of Tetris be the lead with this.

432
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:57,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But in celebration of the 40th year anniversary of Tetris, there is a Goldmaster collection from Digital Eclipse coming out.

433
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:03,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to include something called Tetris Time Warp because Digital Eclipse likes to do these kind of modern takes on the games in the Gold series.

434
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,509
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an interactive museum where you can play

435
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:11,834
[SPEAKER_04]: The original Famicom version of Tetris, which is not the same as the Nintendo version of Tetris.

436
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:20,382
[SPEAKER_04]: They announced that that will be coming as the Nintendo Switch Online, which actually surprised me that they had the rights to be able to do that.

437
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was very cool, honestly.

438
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Bomb Bliss, Super Tetris 2 and Bomb Bliss, Tetris Battle Gaiden, and Super Tetris 3.

439
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:31,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, everybody was asking, where's the Grandmaster?

440
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Arcade Archives and Hamster, whoever puts that out, has the rights to that.

441
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,307
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get that on the Switch right now if you want.

442
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are the games that are going to make up this.

443
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:51,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Gold Master Series from Digital Clips, if you are a gaming history, you like that type of stuff, if you believe in game preservation stuff...

444
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:53,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the gold standard.

445
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:54,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an ironic name.

446
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:57,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the gold standard of how to fucking preserve games.

447
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will be getting this as soon as it comes out.

448
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also has Hatris, which is awesome.

449
00:34:02,884 --> 00:34:03,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have Hatris?

450
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have Hatris.

451
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:07,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have Wordtris and Facetris and Weltris?

452
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:08,786
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just Hatris.

453
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:09,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fine.

454
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Blastress, which is the coolest to say.

455
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:19,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf points out you also get the literal original computer version on the Russian computer, the Electronica 60.

456
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's pretty cool.

457
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:22,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they had to remake it.

458
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:25,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's like an emulator for the Electronica 60, but close enough.

459
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that Tetris time warp thing.

460
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that?

461
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:29,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.

462
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:31,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks really cool, huh?

463
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:32,854
[SPEAKER_03]: The ASCII stuff.

464
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:33,474
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

465
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:34,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, yep.

466
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:36,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the original Tetris, of course.

467
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:45,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, it does not include, unfortunately, VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf contributed to a game in the 90s called Acid Tris.

468
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Acid Tris or Acid Tetris?

469
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:47,564
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the two.

470
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:55,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Acid Tetris is not a part of this collection, so I'm sorry you'll have to stick to... It's too cool for that collection.

471
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:59,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear the composer would not license the rights to the music.

472
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:00,955
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

473
00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:01,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

474
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:02,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting rumors.

475
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:03,217
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't ask.

476
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:08,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available on the Internet Archive, though, at least for now, if you want to check that out.

477
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:14,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Another shadow drop of a game called Pizza Tower that looks like it's very Wario Land-esque.

478
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:19,994
[SPEAKER_04]: If you love yourself some Metal Slug and you love yourself some tactical games, guess what?

479
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:20,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Slug Tactics

480
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:22,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Fall of 2024.

481
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:24,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, oh boy.

482
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, one more.

483
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:32,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Shovel Knight, Shovel of Hope Deluxe coming out in 2025.

484
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,498
[SPEAKER_04]: A recent classic game.

485
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:34,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

486
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Very recent.

487
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like you read their mind.

488
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,120
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't, but it's almost like you did.

489
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,542
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare they read my mind?

490
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more stuff they announced too, but that was kind of the tip of the iceberg.

491
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,905
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to talk about Coffee Talk Tokyo?

492
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:49,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Coffee Talk.

493
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:50,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Coffee Talk Tokyo.

494
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,337
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I apparently missed that one.

495
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:55,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Come by us in Shibuya.

496
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk.

497
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:01,684
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

498
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:02,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm verklempt.

499
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:04,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the topic.

500
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Shibuya.

501
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither a shoe nor booyah.

502
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:07,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Discuss.

503
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:13,295
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, DarkSakura, I did not see disco.

504
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:15,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see full cosplay.

505
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:24,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a full-on Linda Richmond in cosplay with the sweater, the wig, big glasses, and was carrying around a little picture.

506
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It was either like a Barbara vinyl or was carrying around like a photo of Barbara.

507
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:32,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, that's the best cosplay I'll see the whole fucking convention right there.

508
00:36:33,243 --> 00:36:34,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

509
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:36,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone should have been Madonna as her friend.

510
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:39,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you imagine?

511
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:43,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, the cosplay at DragonCon, next level.

512
00:36:43,432 --> 00:36:46,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk more about DragonCon in this next segment, but I will say this.

513
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: The one and only Mr. Alan Alchemy, my husband, has asked that he will not go to DragonCon next year.

514
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:02,962
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes it, but it's just a little too... For his introversion senses, he's a little too... But...

515
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:13,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is going to come next year, confirmed, because the minute she heard that Alan wasn't going, she was like, maybe I want to come.

516
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to come, actually.

517
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:22,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Victoria, or Arya Snark, my old pal from Shaking and Crying, who by the way is a cosplay queen all her own.

518
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,941
[SPEAKER_04]: She's known in some of those Disney circles like D23 and stuff.

519
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:29,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really hoping she brings some of her Disney stuff to DragonCon.

520
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:30,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for it.

521
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:31,623
[SPEAKER_04]: She has bought her membership.

522
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:35,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not like a DragonCon 2025.

523
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be shaking and crying in person.

524
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:39,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it.

525
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

526
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:41,828
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

527
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:46,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.

528
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

529
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:54,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I played, of course, some Dead by Daylight.

530
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:58,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some Palia.

531
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:05,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the casting of Frank Stone, which does look like I'll be able to play it tonight.

532
00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:10,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I did just a little bit of it to test the game.

533
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:15,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And what else did I do?

534
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:19,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not now?

535
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:59,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I went to see Sterlok, who was visiting, and I drove quite a bit to go talk, and we went to a pub and had a great meal, and his mom is a total Disney nerd and an absolute trip, and I adore his folks.

536
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:00,404
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so nice.

537
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have gone too if I didn't have Convid.

538
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:33,626
[SPEAKER_07]: it was really great to finally get to hang out in person and just have great conversations and I'd like to say that he is as kind and personable in person as he is over texts and chats and things and I had a great time and as it worked out because I had no idea where this place was originally because I don't know California geography super great

539
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:55,754
[SPEAKER_07]: um I ended up uh since I had to go through Petaluma um I went back and saw Susan who is one of as we call it the OG Jew crew out here um me and my friends from synagogue um and so we hung out for a while and went to

540
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:58,115
[SPEAKER_07]: The Death Star was so good.

541
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,139
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a dark ale that was called The Death Star and it was amazing.

542
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It would give Guinness a run for its money.

543
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:07,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, The Death Star was amazing.

544
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:11,426
[SPEAKER_07]: But I stopped by in South Susan and we went to a cafe.

545
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:15,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I came back with so many leftovers because my stomach was just a wreck yesterday.

546
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:42,772
[SPEAKER_07]: um but um it was it was overall you know I had a great time it was good catching up with Susan because it's been a couple years but really a lot of fun uh hanging out with Sturlock we had I think a marvelous time and I I'm looking forward to doing it again um on the next visit and maybe spending a little bit more time so a great absolute great time nice

547
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:43,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to hear it.

548
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to hear friends of the show meeting IRL.

549
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:47,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

550
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:49,110
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

551
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to Loki.

552
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:51,211
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

553
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:55,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mostly Minecraft and editing, that type of stuff.

554
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:56,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it was mostly editing.

555
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:09,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I did put out an episode earlier this week off of this spin-off SMP that I was playing on with some of the other members from our SMP and...

556
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:15,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Some, I think, from other things, Orthoblox and whatnot.

557
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:20,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was kind of like a survival challenge thing where the whole world was frozen.

558
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:26,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I played a Mr. Freeze character in that.

559
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been kind of having fun grinding through that, but I've kind of run out of things to do in it.

560
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:34,283

[SPEAKER_04]: Get some more clicks from chat right now.

564
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

565
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:05,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we gotta get more eyes on Loki's stuff.

00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:08,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, somebody, one of these days, the right person's gonna see it.

567
00:42:09,432 --> 00:42:09,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep at it.

568
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:11,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

569
00:42:11,574 --> 00:42:11,795
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

570
00:42:11,815 --> 00:42:12,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Long after I'm gone.

571
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:14,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

572
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:15,116
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

573
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:19,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to come back to you in Minecraft in just a minute because boy, do I have a question for you.

574
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:23,140
[SPEAKER_04]: But meanwhile, let's go to my gaming week.

575
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of my games this week, you know, Final Fantasy 14.

576
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:32,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my dancer to level 100 max level 70 PS and a little bit Diablo 4 as well.

577
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:32,825
[SPEAKER_04]: DragonCon

578
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: and Manny Jacinto from The Good Place who also plays a key character in Star Wars Acolyte and asked these questions and banter back and forth with.

579
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:20,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really wild and really an honor and delight so I really truly thank DragonCon for trusting me to do it and I had a good time.

580
00:43:20,996 --> 00:43:22,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll talk a little more in depth about those panels.

581
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:23,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to do one for...

582
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:27,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Bobby Blackwolf says Giancarlo Esposito erasure.

583
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,123
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Natasha Lou Bordizzo also very lovely.

584
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:32,063
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all great.

585
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Just we'll talk more about it on an upcoming show.

586
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:42,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So Star Trek Lower Decks, probably the funniest fucking panel I've ever done in my entire life, was so good.

587
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:44,231
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that as well.

588
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But from the gaming front, I got to do a couple of panels.

589
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:50,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So the very first panel of my convention, well...

590
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:53,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a meetup Thursday night.

591
00:43:53,688 --> 00:44:00,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So VOG Network actually hosted on the digital media track a cool little meetup, which was just like a meet and greet.

592
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had like icebreaker topics that would rotate on the board.

593
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:06,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's a promo that you like to use to promote yourself?

594
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,332
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a key piece of software you use?

595
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:10,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of, you know, we're able to meet some people.

596
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:13,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say I made some really good connections.

597
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:17,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody from Thursday night's meetup is out there listening tonight, hello and welcome and thank you for being here.

598
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:19,577
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really cool.

599
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:20,798
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to do that again next year.

600
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:26,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have a lot of notice this year, so we're going to do it next year with some more notice and try to bring in some more people because we had a lot of fun.

601
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:35,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Worked with a TikToker who had millions of views when they were viral, so it's kind of interesting to hear about their experience about all that.

602
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was very cool.

603
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:41,158
[SPEAKER_04]: But my first actual panel that I did was Friday morning.

604
00:44:41,518 --> 00:44:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had a ballroom panel, which was an hour with Amelia Gotham.

605
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And she is a voice actress.

606
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:49,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to talk about this term in a little bit.

607
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:52,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the game she worked with, it was just voice acting.

608
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I say just, but it's important.

609
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:59,487
[SPEAKER_04]: She is best known as Princess Mipha.

610
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:00,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

611
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:05,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she was that in the... I almost said the link to the past.

612
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

613
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a little bit of the brain thing going on with everything that's happened this week.

614
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:11,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Breath of the Wild.

615
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,479
[SPEAKER_04]: She played Princess Mipha in a very key couple of scenes in that game.

616
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:24,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they actually kind of ended up expanding on the character in the action-y Zelda game.

617
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,531
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

618
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:29,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my brain is...

619
00:45:30,891 --> 00:45:32,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Age of Calamity Age of Calamity

620
00:45:54,147 --> 00:46:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know so she was still part of that so we got to do a nice panel and she she has done other video games she actually has a Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns is actually an early credit on her resume I think she did Moogle voices in that game she's additional voices credit but I think she was a lot of the Moogles in that game so she she did some other cool little stuff so she had a ballroom for her panel and I gotta say I was I was really bummed for her that only eight people showed up for the panel and

621
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:25,282
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, but, you know, and this happens sometimes.

622
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:33,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes because it's early morning or because I think what happened in this case, this panel was not added to the schedule until late.

623
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:36,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So it did not make the printed programs.

624
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:37,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It was only in the app.

625
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:50,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, especially Friday, right when the whole thing is really getting underway for a lot of people, I just think it was just an unfortunate sort of arithmetic of issues that caused

626
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:51,506
[SPEAKER_04]: People Do Not Really Turn Up.

627
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:55,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It also was not in the usual video game spot, which I think was a key issue too.

628
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the video game panels are at the Westin.

629
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,490
[SPEAKER_04]: This one was over at the Hyatt.

630
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that does make a difference when your fans are kind of spread out a little bit.

631
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is what it is.

632
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:11,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had kind of joked with her before when we had a sense that there might not be a lot of people that turn up.

633
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:12,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you know what?

634
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:14,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We do the same show, whether it's two people or 200 people.

635
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:16,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, I like that.

636
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:17,417
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sign of a professional.

637
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:42,499
[SPEAKER_04]: and I appreciated her saying that and you know what we did we had a really long I wish we'd recorded it you know going back hindsight 2020 um I if I'd known it wasn't going to be recorded by Dragon Con I would have brought a recorder because it was really lovely just to have an in-depth chat with her because sure we talked plenty about Zelda and her character and that and what all went into that scene but with the time allotted we were able to really go in depth about

638
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:49,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Her acting background, she's actually from theater, as you will find a lot of voice actors come from that background.

639
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,450
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not just voice actors, they are actors.

640
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:59,681
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may interject, something that Neil Newborn has been quoted saying is that it's not voice acting, it's acting.

641
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:04,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to come back to that because that got brought up live.

642
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:06,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll get to that in a minute.

643
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:12,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, with Amelia, I got to talk to her about that.

644
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:14,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got to talk about inspiration.

645
00:48:14,688 --> 00:48:17,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And the audience got to ask a couple questions.

646
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:21,690
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have a lot because there wasn't that many of them, but they got to ask basically whatever they wanted.

647
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the guys was asking about who were...

648
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:27,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the coolest celebrity you ever met?

649
00:48:27,854 --> 00:48:28,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was neat.

650
00:48:28,895 --> 00:48:31,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And her answer was actually John Waters.

651
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:41,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took everything within me to not say... And this is me doing good because we're not supposed to make the panels about ourselves.

652
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:46,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yes, this is hard for me to do because in this, yes, I do get to talk about myself.

653
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:48,755
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took everything within me to not jump in and go...

654
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:52,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I met John Waters too, and I love him, you know?

655
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to be like, oh, how, you know, so we had to ask this question.

656
00:48:55,658 --> 00:49:00,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it was over, I told her, I said, oh my God, when you brought up John Waters, I love him.

657
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,080
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we kind of got to talk about that.

658
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was just really cool.

659
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I just liked her as a person.

660
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:09,163
[SPEAKER_04]: She's really down to earth, as a lot of these folks are.

661
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought we were able to have a great conversation.

662
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:15,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really is going to be the biggest crime of DragonCon that that was not recorded.

663
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:18,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And so 10 people in that room,

664
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a very special thing that will never be repeated.

665
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sorry to say.

666
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:26,050
[SPEAKER_04]: But Amelia Gotham, lovely, lovely human.

667
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really wish her much success.

668
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:32,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope she shows up in future Nintendo games and whatever stuff.

669
00:49:32,712 --> 00:49:35,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope her career goes very well because I thought she was very lovely.

670
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:39,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Also did a panel.

671
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the other gaming-related panel.

672
00:49:41,616 --> 00:49:46,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So Saturday morning, right after the parade, was my Baldur's Gate 3...

673
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:48,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

674
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:49,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

675
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

676
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,530
[SPEAKER_04]: was her girlfriend there?

677
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:29,160
[SPEAKER_04]: yes her girlfriend was there and I actually rearranged the name tags before we started so they could sit next to each other because I was like that's not going to work let me just tell you those two are madly in love madly in love you can see it it was radiating from the stage here's the reality of the way these conventions work

678
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I moderated the panel.

679
00:50:31,302 --> 00:50:41,294
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not mean I like hung out with them or spent a lot of extended time with them because the reality is they're making money while they're at con.

680
00:50:41,534 --> 00:50:43,497
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're at a panel, they're not making money.

681
00:50:43,977 --> 00:50:48,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to clear out the lines for their table, hold the line, get them away from the table.

682
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:53,049
[SPEAKER_04]: and there was a whole other complication because the DragonCon parade happened Saturday morning.

683
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So it took them some time.

684
00:50:54,572 --> 00:50:59,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They walked into the Westin right in the there's little backstage areas where they come in.

685
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: They came in like one minute before the panel was supposed to start.

686
00:51:04,747 --> 00:51:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really just got to say, hello, hello, verify some of the pronunciations.

687
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Jennifer's girlfriend, Iona, she actually asked me, she said, do you know how to pronounce my name?

688
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I actually appreciate.

689
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to fuck that up on stage, right?

690
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:19,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get it right.

691
00:51:20,471 --> 00:51:27,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I also want to mention Theo, who plays Will, who was actually one of my favorite characters in the game, was also there as well.

692
00:51:27,553 --> 00:51:28,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a really good...

693
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:33,290
[SPEAKER_04]: a mix of the cast that was there.

694
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:39,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to say, like for an hour, it really felt like there was just like this family reunion going on.

695
00:51:39,173 --> 00:51:42,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel how close knit this group is.

696
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:47,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really just felt like I got to like peek into that just for an hour and ask these questions.

697
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:51,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of the questions that came up, so I had Neil sitting next to me.

698
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:56,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all, I had Neil sitting next to me.

699
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm full of hatred right now.

700
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna lie, you should.

701
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is one of those things where it's like, I'm just, like, pinch me.

702
00:52:06,388 --> 00:52:08,151
[SPEAKER_04]: That period happened, period.

703
00:52:08,552 --> 00:52:14,881
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'm a professional, and I would never let Neil know that he's a very, very, very handsome man.

704
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,443
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DragonCon

705
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:35,831
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

706
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:57,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking loved it because if the audience was targeting certain people with questions, which is what happens, right?

707
00:52:57,412 --> 00:53:03,579
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get a lineup, you know, and the lineup I just mentioned, you can imagine there were one or two people on that panel that were getting more questions than others.

708
00:53:03,899 --> 00:53:09,725
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I could do is then, aha, here's a question from Discord and I'm going to throw this at somebody who's not getting a lot of questions.

709
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love that as a moderator to be able to do that.

710
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say,

711
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:14,390
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

712
00:53:36,664 --> 00:53:37,125
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

713
00:53:37,285 --> 00:53:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, I wanted to make sure everybody had a say, right?

714
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:42,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was really cool.

715
00:53:43,073 --> 00:53:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the questions that came in on Discord was, I have a question as an aspiring voice actor.

716
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where Neil said, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

717
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:52,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Actors, Actors, Actors

718
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:33,157
[SPEAKER_04]: so just call us actors and I said okay we can do that and then I read the rest of the question which really was about voice acting tips and I think it was Dev who piped in and said well now Neil the question really was about voice acting now wasn't it so I did so it kind of took a little bit of the heat off of me as the moderator because I was just kind of but I'm really glad that topic did come up because yes especially it is interesting a game like

719
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:58,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Breath of the Wild which may have done mocap in Japan but certainly not with what Amelia did um she really was just doing voice acting not to diminish her talents she's fantastic and and all but it is a like that was voice acting and what the Baldur's Gate folks did was acting they had the mocap suits they did that and so it is something we need to be aware of these days and uh um

720
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:05,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, folks who want to get into voice acting need to be prepared to get into acting.

721
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:06,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

722
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:07,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, going to some comments in chat.

723
00:55:08,078 --> 00:55:15,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the Red Dead Redemption 2 panelists did the same and used performance actor as their preferred term a few years back.

724
00:55:15,885 --> 00:55:21,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the term I started to lobby thinking they would say the same thing, but no, it actually wasn't that.

725
00:55:21,671 --> 00:55:22,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was, there was that.

726
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:23,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

727
00:55:24,173 --> 00:55:42,246
[SPEAKER_04]: and by the way I gave the feedback to the appropriate channels at DragonCon and in future years you should no longer see things labeled just voice actor so it is so yay it's just that's just a relic of the past because again 20 years ago before we had uh that type of motion cap acting it really was nothing but voice acting so it is what it is we got it um

728
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:49,034
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, most voice actors I know would prefer you to call them voice actors.

729
00:55:49,314 --> 00:56:00,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But Ranma, I'm going to guess that's because you come from an anime background, an anime jam session, and they're not doing anything but voice for anime because it's animated, right?

730
00:56:01,198 --> 00:56:08,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think maybe it is a good policy to ask, what do you prefer to be credited as?

731
00:56:08,439 --> 00:56:10,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Actor, performance actor, voice?

732
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Voice Actor.

733
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:16,607
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to need to ask that question as moderators and people that put on panels, and I fully plan to do so.

734
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:20,192
[SPEAKER_04]: DW Wreckage in chat says, that's a great system for Q&A.

735
00:56:21,013 --> 00:56:21,693
[SPEAKER_04]: 100% agree.

736
00:56:22,314 --> 00:56:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I want all the QA to be like that in the future.

737
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:27,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope DragonCon adopts that as the new standard, to be quite honest.

738
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:28,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

739
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:29,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

740
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:37,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Questbuster in chat says, I did everything I could to redeem Astarion, such a fantastic character, and Neil was a huge part.

741
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:41,450
[SPEAKER_04]: All the characters in Baldur's Gate were really amazing, and the actors did such a great job bringing them to life.

742
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:41,450
100%.

743
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,651
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just such a fun panel.

744
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:47,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as moderators and essentially as a DragonCon volunteer...

745
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:48,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

746
00:56:48,754 --> 00:56:49,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

747
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:16,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

748
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:17,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

749
00:57:17,987 --> 00:57:23,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and this is from my Instagram, so I'm sorry to show a picture of a picture, but there it is.

750
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:24,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

751
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:26,693
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

752
00:57:27,754 --> 00:57:28,294
[SPEAKER_03]: You're muted.

753
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:28,975
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

754
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:29,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

755
00:57:29,695 --> 00:57:29,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

756
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:32,197
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was holding up the thing, I brushed the mute button.

757
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:32,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

758
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:33,698
[SPEAKER_04]: But that happened.

759
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:36,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just really fucking cool that that happened.

760
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a loss of words.

761
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was.

762
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:41,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a loss of words for how amazing that whole experience was.

763
00:57:41,264 --> 00:57:41,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you've beclumped.

764
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:42,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I was.

765
00:57:42,865 --> 00:57:43,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I was.

766
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:46,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk amongst yourselves.

767
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:48,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a topic.

768
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:48,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you a topic.

769
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:53,394
[SPEAKER_07]: That selfie was neither self nor e. Discuss.

770
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:54,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Baldur's Gate.

771
00:57:54,736 --> 00:57:56,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither bald nor a gate.

772
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:57,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Discuss.

773
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:01,745
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

774
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:03,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one other panel I did.

775
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:05,810
[SPEAKER_04]: ZELDA, JAPANESE COMPANY

776
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Baldur's Gate, European Company.

777
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were not subject to the same thing that Mass Effect was, which was the voice actor roundup.

778
00:58:32,671 --> 00:58:33,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to do a cool little panel.

779
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby did the same panel on a different day with an extra.

780
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:41,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So Saren, Fred who played Saren was also on Bobby's panel.

781
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:43,893
[SPEAKER_04]: He was not on mine because he didn't get to the convention until Saturday.

782
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:49,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was Courtney Taylor who plays Jack, Ash who plays...

783
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:54,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Tali, and Mark Muir, of course, who plays Mail Shepherd.

784
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:55,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all on this panel.

785
00:58:56,216 --> 00:59:00,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was actually very thankful to Courtney because she actually offered backstage.

786
00:59:00,697 --> 00:59:03,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we don't get a lot of time to talk backstage, but I let them know.

787
00:59:03,598 --> 00:59:06,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hey, I'm aware of what's going on with the strike.

788
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:09,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And Courtney was kind of like, well, we can talk about it.

789
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,481
[SPEAKER_04]: We just can't advertise it as Mass Effect.

790
00:59:11,701 --> 00:59:13,362
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, do you want me to talk about it?

791
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:16,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yes, actually, I would fucking love that.

792
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:17,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't use that word.

793
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:18,343
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, yes, I would love that.

794
00:59:18,384 --> 00:59:19,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure my expression showed it.

795
00:59:19,884 --> 00:59:28,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually started and Cordy was able to give a nice, long, deep dive about why the strike is important and why these AI protections are important.

796
00:59:28,874 --> 00:59:35,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't fight for these AI protections with voice actors, it's going to come for other industries as well.

797
00:59:35,461 --> 00:59:41,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So voice actors and actors are really at the forefront of these types of protections because it's coming for every industry.

798
00:59:41,468 --> 00:59:41,949
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

799
01:00:03,732 --> 01:00:04,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So she did a great job explaining that.

800
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:12,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I, so somewhere along the, I was told when I started that we were not to talk about Mass Effect.

801
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:16,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I fielded all the questions and we had a great discussion.

802
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:19,030
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a great hour where I did not bring up Mass Effect at all.

803
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

804
01:00:39,608 --> 01:00:44,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I took about voice acting, other projects, other, you know, elements.

805
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was a lot of like D&D related things, you know, just a lot of other like random questions.

806
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:49,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we still had a great discussion.

807
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:54,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be quite honest, how old is Mass Effect at this point?

808
01:00:54,512 --> 01:00:58,273
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we are all still drawn to this game because it's so good.

809
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:00,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think... Except Rob.

810
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:00,533
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

811
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:03,014
[SPEAKER_07]: There was that trailer for the fifth Mass Effect.

812
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:07,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but we don't have confirmation any of these actors are in it.

813
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,232
[SPEAKER_07]: We do know that Liara's voice actor is in it.

814
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:12,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Jennifer Hale has signed up for it.

815
01:01:12,994 --> 01:01:14,855
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few of them.

816
01:01:15,035 --> 01:01:15,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fair.

817
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:16,697
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fair.

818
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:20,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But neither of those individuals are in the room.

819
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:24,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, you have to be very careful talking about future projects.

820
01:01:24,703 --> 01:01:29,867
[SPEAKER_04]: As a moderator, I usually filter the future project questions out just because it's a slippery slope.

821
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:31,588
[SPEAKER_04]: But you were bringing up relevance.

822
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:31,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

823
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:38,835
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and I want to be careful using that because obviously Mass Effect has diehard fans till the end.

824
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:42,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm one of them, you know, and there's plenty of them at DragonCon that still dress up.

825
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:49,704
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just like, I'm more thinking of the whole like, I think about like actors that were on Star Trek The Next Generation who are also at DragonCon.

826
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:56,379
[SPEAKER_04]: How many fucking years can you talk about Star Trek The Next Generation without wanting to talk about something else?

827
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:58,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the person who went on the Star Trek cruise.

828
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, but I love it when they don't talk about Star Trek, quite honestly.

829
01:02:04,164 --> 01:02:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I love to hear about their other passions.

830
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:14,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year's strike year was actually some of the best panels that ever happened at DragonCon because they had to talk about something else.

831
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

832
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:17,692
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is a personal opinion.

833
01:02:18,052 --> 01:02:19,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody feels the same way.

834
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:21,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we mix it up.

835
01:02:22,515 --> 01:02:24,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The best panels mix it up a little bit.

836
01:02:24,796 --> 01:02:28,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I went really long on the DragonCon.

837
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:31,260
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about other panels too, but those are the gaming-related ones.

838
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great time.

839
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:35,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be going back to DragonCon next year.

840
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:42,126
[SPEAKER_04]: What panels I get to do, that's on DragonCon, but I really, really, really hope I'm asked to do some of the big fun ones again because I had a great time.

841
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:44,788
[SPEAKER_04]: on my personal list.

842
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:50,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So not that I have anything to do with who gets booked for DragonCon, but I'm curious.

843
01:02:50,293 --> 01:02:57,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's assume everybody here, you all are capable of moderating panels at a convention, and if you haven't yet, you'll do it someday.

844
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would be your dream video game-related panel?

845
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:06,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you mine in a heartbeat, the panel I want to do.

846
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:10,691
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm curious, what video game panel would you want to moderate?

847
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:11,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

848
01:03:12,537 --> 01:03:13,877
[SPEAKER_04]: What video game panel would you want to monitor?

849
01:03:14,918 --> 01:03:16,258
[SPEAKER_03]: What panel?

850
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:19,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

851
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:24,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think... What would be a property I'd be really excited about?

852
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Minecraft stuff, but not necessarily.

853
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:33,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think of TV stuff that would be fun.

854
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd see my...

855
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:52,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, I would say, like, probably Minecraft is what I'm most familiar with, but, like, even, like, entertainment-wise, I would say something like, um, like, any of the Marvel panels would be fun, or even, like, the boys.

856
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they had that, yeah.

857
01:03:55,221 --> 01:04:03,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony Starr is, you know, he'd be a lot of fun, and, um, uh, I'm trying to think what else.

858
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:05,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let me go to DarkSakura.

859
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your dream panel, DarkSakura?

860
01:04:07,324 --> 01:04:11,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd probably want to do something with, like, the early days of Compile.

861
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:14,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, you're like, okay.

862
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:16,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I like that.

863
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Going, like, video game history panels.

864
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:18,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah.

865
01:04:18,728 --> 01:04:23,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a list of people that I would love to just have on the show in general.

866
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:28,351
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know me, I go for the classic stuff or, like, the super technical stuff.

867
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:32,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I would, you know, want to do a focus on, like, say, mocap.

868
01:04:33,968 --> 01:05:00,829
[SPEAKER_07]: or something that's like a panel of people who do this event who may not necessarily be in the same game you know so something that's a little bit more peel back the layers of this aspect of the industry or about sound designers have like Koji Kondo or Uematsu or you know yeah it's about it's sound one would be good

869
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:05,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, too bad it's a dead series now, but like the Saints Row people would have been fun.

870
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:09,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Like back when we're talking like back in the original first or third games.

871
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:33,165
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes they'll do like a 10th anniversary just because the game has got like the original Mortal Kombat mocap folks were on a panel with Bobby last year so you know the brothers that did like half the cast were these two brothers they were on a panel with Bobby last year so sometimes they do that stuff like a reunion type of panel it's possible okay so mine across all mediums anything not just games Tim Curry

872
01:05:33,685 --> 01:05:35,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on, how can I not say Tim Curry?

873
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:36,606
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

874
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:46,550
[SPEAKER_04]: While we still can't, I believe he still does Q&A and that type of stuff, but, you know, obviously, since the stroke, he's a little more limited in mobility, but I would love to see him do that.

875
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,691
[SPEAKER_07]: He's someone I would just want to have tea with, Rob.

876
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:49,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

877
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:53,093
[SPEAKER_04]: But in video games specifically... For our birthday.

878
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:56,819
[SPEAKER_04]: In video games specifically, Ben Starr.

879
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the Ben Starr panel.

880
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the chaotic energy that Ben Starr would bring to DragonCon.

881
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:04,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite frankly, I'm surprised he wasn't at this DragonCon.

882
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:06,326
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe he's working on a project or something.

883
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:07,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the panel I want.

884
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:08,767
[SPEAKER_04]: That or...

885
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:36,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Jonathan Bailey who is in Final Fantasy 14 as Grahatia but he's done he's in a lot of stuff now he's in he's gonna be in Wicked he's in damn it there's some other my brain is is frying a little bit so yeah that would that would be like how about a panel with both of them and Gideon Emery will be a Final Fantasy voice acting panel we'll just do that

886
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:43,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I would want him for Dragon Age stuff.

887
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:44,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

888
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:46,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had Dragon Age folks.

889
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:48,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a lot of the people that do Mass Effect also do Dragon Age.

890
01:06:49,195 --> 01:06:50,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

891
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:53,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, all right.

892
01:06:53,582 --> 01:06:54,662
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough about Khan.

893
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:58,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Please look forward to next year in just under 360 days.

894
01:06:58,644 --> 01:06:58,964
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

895
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:03,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, looking forward a little bit, let's talk about this.

896
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:14,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I've been dying for the last few days to ask you, our resident Minecraft fan, about a little something that hit the internet this week.

897
01:07:14,612 --> 01:07:17,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you please tell us about it and your thoughts?

898
01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:46,105
[SPEAKER_03]: well I mean so we knew this was coming and we've seen like leaks of images so it wasn't a complete shock but the Minecraft movie teaser trailer has finally been released it was like a minute or so of the movie it's a live action and CG movie which from the outset like when I heard about this like years ago

899
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:48,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's a bad idea.

900
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:51,815
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be fully animated like the Lego movie or something like that.

901
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:54,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear there's good writers on it.

902
01:07:55,197 --> 01:08:08,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say it was the guy that did the Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre movies as well as I think they even have some folks that worked on the Lego movie in there as well.

903
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But the trailer just sends the wrong vibes I think.

904
01:08:14,627 --> 01:08:15,348
[SPEAKER_03]: One, it looks...

905
01:08:17,245 --> 01:08:23,875
[SPEAKER_03]: The live action folks look very out of place in the actual shots.

906
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's intentional or not, but it looks cheap.

907
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:31,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's weird is I've seen... I mean, there's been...

908
01:08:32,268 --> 01:08:53,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So many Minecraft movies or little fan things that people have done, which is why they're calling it a Minecraft movie, not the Minecraft movie, because I think that's kind of the whole celebrating that there are a lot of folks out there that create content that are fans of it, and this is just a take from that.

909
01:08:54,275 --> 01:08:56,376
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem with it is there's a lot of things.

910
01:08:57,177 --> 01:08:58,377
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some issues with it.

911
01:08:58,397 --> 01:09:10,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So technically, just with the trailer, from the outset, all of the characters in the trailer don't seem to be interested to be in the scenarios that they are.

912
01:09:10,823 --> 01:09:21,269
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, all of the reactions from the characters to the environment and the people inside of this are just annoyed, which...

913
01:09:22,637 --> 01:09:24,278
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not how you sell a movie.

914
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:26,959
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to sell excitement.

915
01:09:27,099 --> 01:09:31,482
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go, ugh, ugh, why am I, ugh, what is that?

916
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:33,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh, yo, this guy's stupid.

917
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh, like, what?

918
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:37,705
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't sell a movie like that.

919
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:38,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just stupid.

920
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why would you market a movie like that?

921
01:09:42,147 --> 01:09:48,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of that, like, I have so many nitpicks, like, the technical points of it, because, you know, I play Minecraft, and I play modded Minecraft as well.

922
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the movie itself, um...

923
01:09:53,429 --> 01:09:57,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to take Minecraft and make it realistic in the first place.

924
01:09:57,712 --> 01:10:03,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Minecraft blocks are supposed to be a square meter in size, which is huge, obviously.

925
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:11,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make sense to be a square meter for... These kids would have to be hoisted up on the environment.

926
01:10:11,101 --> 01:10:14,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess there are some creative liberties taken there.

927
01:10:14,883 --> 01:10:17,685
[SPEAKER_03]: But the size proportions are all over the place.

928
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:18,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have...

929
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:22,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Blocks that look to be about two feet square, which is fine.

930
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:31,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have the actual items that drop that are like the size of a Rubik's Cube or even smaller than that, which is just really weird.

931
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:38,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You have things that are in this movie that are clearly not Minecraft.

932
01:10:38,786 --> 01:10:40,647
[SPEAKER_03]: You have spinning windmills.

933
01:10:41,806 --> 01:10:44,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a thing that's in vanilla Minecraft.

934
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:47,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's not that type of movement in the game.

935
01:10:48,112 --> 01:10:51,436
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it's a secret announcement, like the Wizard and Mario 3?

936
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:53,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not, come on.

937
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:54,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

938
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:59,283
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing too is there's a lot of focus on the piglins in this, which...

939
01:10:59,844 --> 01:11:00,945
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

940
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:23,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which is awful because Legends was awful and that's why it's not a game anymore.

941
01:11:23,683 --> 01:11:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make that based around that storyline because it's, I mean, the Penguins are okay, but there's a lot of other things out there.

942
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:33,271
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not going to be the end or the end of Dragon in this movie already.

943
01:11:33,771 --> 01:11:38,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and like the rest of it, I just don't understand it.

944
01:11:38,275 --> 01:11:40,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jason Momoa, why are you dressed like that?

945
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:42,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what's the point of that?

946
01:11:43,047 --> 01:11:44,627
[SPEAKER_03]: and Jack Black as Steve.

947
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:46,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Black is very excited about this role.

948
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big fan of Minecraft.

949
01:11:49,049 --> 01:11:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But they literally threw a blue shirt on Jack Black.

950
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:55,110
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do anything to Jack Black to make him look more like the character.

951
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,331
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do anything with it.

952
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:59,311
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very least, it should have been animated.

953
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:04,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, there have been already people that have animated the whole trailer in Minecraft.

954
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:05,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

955
01:12:05,253 --> 01:12:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks better.

956
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:08,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... It's silly.

957
01:12:08,133 --> 01:12:09,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw that in our Discord.

958
01:12:09,414 --> 01:12:10,874
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerCloud made that up.

959
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm still gonna see it day one.

960
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:28,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I am still interested to see what it is, and I don't think you can really understand the storyline with it from just a teaser trailer, but everything that they've done so far, just the vibe of that, saying, oh, well, like, all the characters are annoyed, they're like...

961
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:31,620
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

962
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:51,047
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there's the art style which I

963
01:13:11,673 --> 01:13:12,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that is.

964
01:13:13,174 --> 01:13:15,335
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't commit either way.

965
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:24,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so funny that the guy that folks working on the movie said they didn't want it to be like Sonic the Hedgehog with the CGI.

966
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet the first thing you see is a character that looks like the original Sonic.

967
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:29,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

968
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:31,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

969
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:32,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you do that?

970
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you didn't have to do that.

971
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to have human teeth.

972
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:38,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you do that?

973
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:44,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the same horse in the race where, like, I don't have the same feelings about Minecraft.

974
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:46,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't invested as much in it or whatever.

975
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:53,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will just say that those, the llama and the pig or whatever that was, the animals, those are the things of nightmares.

976
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Llama and the sheep?

977
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:55,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the things with nightmares.

978
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:57,083
[SPEAKER_03]: The sheep looks bad.

979
01:13:57,303 --> 01:13:58,544
[SPEAKER_03]: The llama looks okay.

980
01:13:58,744 --> 01:14:00,025
[SPEAKER_03]: The wolf looks good.

981
01:14:00,846 --> 01:14:02,266
[SPEAKER_03]: The piglins look good.

982
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:06,169
[SPEAKER_03]: The ghasts, creepy, but they're always creepy.

983
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:14,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm going to laugh if this is a Ni No Kuni situation and the movie is actually really good, but had the trailer done by a crappy studio.

984
01:14:14,995 --> 01:14:16,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, please note the date and time.

985
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:19,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby finally admitted that Ni No Kuni is a good game.

986
01:14:19,557 --> 01:14:22,218
[SPEAKER_04]: He did it in a roundabout way, but he finally fucking did it.

987
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:23,138
[SPEAKER_04]: We got there.

988
01:14:23,518 --> 01:14:23,898
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it.

989
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:24,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Mission accomplished.

990
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:27,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Got him!

991
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, seriously though, I am excited to see the movie.

992
01:14:31,481 --> 01:14:37,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not excited that the same large content creators are the ones being showcased in these movies, but that's neither here nor there.

993
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:48,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that in general, if you're marketing a movie, it's best not to market it in a way that makes it seem like this movie's lame.

994
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:52,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, don't have your characters going, ugh, I don't want to be here.

995
01:14:52,308 --> 01:14:53,049
[SPEAKER_04]: What about this, Loki?

996
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:59,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a lot of people in chat that are bringing up the point about, you know, and I think Kotaku ran a whole article on this too, about how the movie is for kids, right?

997
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:03,457
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, if you were a kid, you're probably going to view this movie in a different way.

998
01:15:03,517 --> 01:15:07,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know you have kids, but maybe I would actually say your kids are probably actually a little too old.

999
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're more in that tween age.

1000
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but I play Minecraft still.

1001
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:15,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I play it every single day.

1002
01:15:15,726 --> 01:15:27,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not like... And I understand... Like, why dismiss my opinion, like, in general, like Kotaku or whoever, why dismiss my opinion, you know, my nitpicks about the movie?

1003
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:32,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they are very valid in the sense of, like, you know...

1004
01:15:33,631 --> 01:15:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you know thankfully it's not you know any like sort of like targeting gender or anything like that but we're talking like we're talking about like technical like stuff in the in the actual trailer and an adult ticket is worth more money than a child ticket exactly and well and on top of that I'm not saying that like what you're saying if you make the argument well it's targeted towards children so what you're saying that argument right there says that

1005
01:16:00,638 --> 01:16:04,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't invest the time to make this story good.

1006
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,521
[SPEAKER_03]: We just, you know, we put a little bit of effort into it.

1007
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:08,022
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a threadbare storyline that

1008
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: An Idiot Child Can Follow.

1009
01:16:21,931 --> 01:16:30,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And we made sure to just have cameos of things on there because their simple minds can't understand more complex things.

1010
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:37,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind you that us, we grew up back in the 80s when there was a lot of

1011
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:56,646
[SPEAKER_04]: movies that just had storylines and the movies were out to scar us all remember like Return to Oz or the Never Ending Story Swamp Scene or Return to like there's so many movies that were out to like literally Gremlins that wasn't a kids movie Poltergeist

1012
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:13,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Gremlins was never a kids movie Gremlins was written for adults but they're so cute I don't think that it's fair one, you should never just dismiss your audience because they're like, well it's not targeted towards you

1013
01:17:14,522 --> 01:17:25,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't hear no baby shark in there, and I didn't see no, like, Counteen and, you know, the... It wasn't the Teletubbies, it was Jason Momoa.

1014
01:17:25,748 --> 01:17:30,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we really want to target those children, let's put all that garbage.

1015
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:32,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Spider-Man or Elsa in that trailer?

1016
01:17:32,172 --> 01:17:33,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Skibbity Toilet?

1017
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Skibbity Toilet?

1018
01:17:35,353 --> 01:17:35,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1019
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:38,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's coming later on, you know.

1020
01:17:39,796 --> 01:17:39,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1021
01:17:40,538 --> 01:17:40,999
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1022
01:17:41,259 --> 01:17:42,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.

1023
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Bay, is he targeting children for the Skivity Toilet movie?

1024
01:17:46,043 --> 01:17:46,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I think not.

1025
01:17:46,884 --> 01:17:51,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why would you even, you know, it's an excuse is what it is.

1026
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:52,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an excuse.

1027
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:55,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, here's the thing, and I will try to wrap this up.

1028
01:17:56,613 --> 01:17:57,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1029
01:17:57,493 --> 01:17:57,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Mojang

1030
01:17:59,048 --> 01:17:59,769
[SPEAKER_03]: and their audience.

1031
01:18:00,249 --> 01:18:09,917
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had some struggles recently with capturing what the audience actually wants them to, you know, in a game that they're designing.

1032
01:18:10,017 --> 01:18:14,801
[SPEAKER_03]: They go on some tangents that are just kind of out there and don't really make any sense.

1033
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:21,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, like, this trailer does look like it is a live action thing that they filmed for...

1034
01:18:22,262 --> 01:18:23,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like Minecraft Live stuff.

1035
01:18:23,923 --> 01:18:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's very cheap.

1036
01:18:26,564 --> 01:18:28,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, I think those actually look better.

1037
01:18:28,426 --> 01:18:33,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's very, you know, obvious green screen, all that stuff.

1038
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:36,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's to say, this could also be a stylistic choice.

1039
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:38,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have a good story.

1040
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:39,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know until we go into it.

1041
01:18:39,912 --> 01:18:47,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hope it's not like something like the Borderlands movie where it was very threadbare and it was just rushed.

1042
01:18:47,776 --> 01:18:48,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And so...

1043
01:18:49,787 --> 01:18:52,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this has been in development for over a decade.

1044
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:54,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people have touched it.

1045
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully it's good.

1046
01:18:57,211 --> 01:19:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't want anything to fail, but if they don't listen to their audience and just run straight forward with whatever garbage they think that we want to see without actually listening to their audience, then you could end up with, you know, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie without the fixes.

1047
01:19:15,148 --> 01:19:17,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll find out in April when this movie comes out.

1048
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, I must say, I was expecting a lot more yelling.

1049
01:19:20,712 --> 01:19:22,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one more thing.

1050
01:19:22,433 --> 01:19:25,154
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sonic the Hedgehog 3 trailer came out as well.

1051
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:26,835
[SPEAKER_03]: A perfect example right there.

1052
01:19:27,136 --> 01:19:30,158
[SPEAKER_03]: There is something, hey, that's weird, it's targeted towards kids.

1053
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:31,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

1054
01:19:31,078 --> 01:19:32,459
[SPEAKER_03]: The story's not bad.

1055
01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:33,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

1056
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:35,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It has interesting characters.

1057
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:38,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And the CGI doesn't look like total trash.

1058
01:19:38,823 --> 01:19:45,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so weird that you can make a movie like that that actually respects the audience and everybody that's in there.

1059
01:19:45,967 --> 01:19:46,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Because guess what?

1060
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: People that played Sonic the Hedgehog, that game came out decades ago.

1061
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:53,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe some of the adults would want to see that as well?

1062
01:19:54,011 --> 01:19:58,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Minecraft has come out over several decades ago.

1063
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:00,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 15 years, I guess.

1064
01:20:00,314 --> 01:20:02,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So 15 years ago, it came out.

1065
01:20:03,297 --> 01:20:05,478
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that are grown adults now.

1066
01:20:06,339 --> 01:20:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really think that they don't deserve a good Minecraft movie?

1067
01:20:09,521 --> 01:20:10,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, come on.

1068
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:11,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make excuses for them.

1069
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:15,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear movie writers, go back and watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.

1070
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:16,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

1071
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:17,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1072
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:21,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to move on and talk about other types of movies on YouTube.

1073
01:20:22,176 --> 01:20:26,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo sometimes gets involved with their own policies.

1074
01:20:26,217 --> 01:20:30,078
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember some time ago they had a whole program where they were going to demonetize.

1075
01:20:30,298 --> 01:20:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's all long gone.

1076
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:37,181
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have announced some new guidelines for folks that are going to be making YouTubes.

1077
01:20:37,781 --> 01:20:39,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are as follows.

1078
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:41,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not allowed to do, quote,

1079
01:20:42,202 --> 01:20:48,643
[SPEAKER_04]: content containing actions that may be considered to impair the gameplay experience in multiplayer and modes.

1080
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: That behavior is now banned.

1081
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:57,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo reserves the right to no longer allow the use of Nintendo game content if violations are found.

1082
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:00,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the two big changes this time around.

1083
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, like, I gotta be honest.

1084
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:08,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at this and I go, okay, so Nintendo doesn't want you doing these, like, multiplayer trolling things in their games.

1085
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:09,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I actually...

1086
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:12,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't sit here and go, that's unreasonable.

1087
01:21:12,788 --> 01:21:13,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that.

1088
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a certain audience on YouTube that does say, that's not fair.

1089
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:20,292
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking away our freedom of speech and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1090
01:21:20,552 --> 01:21:23,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're free to do whatever pranks you want.

1091
01:21:23,453 --> 01:21:25,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo just doesn't want their products associated with it.

1092
01:21:26,335 --> 01:21:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And until YouTube changes their guidelines, which I don't think they're going to until copyright law changes, you're going to have to sit and spin.

1093
01:21:34,519 --> 01:21:36,260
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to claim parody.

1094
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:36,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1095
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, can it...

1096
01:21:40,097 --> 01:21:47,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the question's going to be, and it depends how far Nintendo's lawyers want to take this, and Nintendo's lawyers often want to take... Although, I don't know.

1097
01:21:47,045 --> 01:21:48,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You get into property rights.

1098
01:21:48,506 --> 01:21:52,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I've given up on PAL World and that whole thing.

1099
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought for sure we would have seen something Nintendo happen with that now, but apparently...

1100
01:21:56,875 --> 01:22:01,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it is enough percentage of parody where Nintendo has realized they can't do anything about it.

1101
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:02,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1102
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:12,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can say that YouTube copyright strikes do not often side with the creator, but they side with the copyright holder.

1103
01:22:13,068 --> 01:22:17,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And if Nintendo decides to make your YouTube channels life hell, they can make it happen.

1104
01:22:18,055 --> 01:22:20,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you call it this or that.

1105
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:28,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're trolling people in Nintendo games, I can see where they're like, you know what, we don't want our brand associated with that.

1106
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:32,483
[SPEAKER_04]: What this tells me, there's somebody they want to go after.

1107
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:51,744
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're gonna soon so if that is your uh if that is your MMO is uh you know MO or whatever is making uh trolly your MMO sorry uh obviously my brain sucks today if your MO is making um trolly Nintendo things then just you know look out

1108
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you're making that kind of content now, what year is it, really?

1109
01:22:57,258 --> 01:22:57,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, guys.

1110
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:00,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow the fuck up.

1111
01:23:00,921 --> 01:23:03,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some pretty weak content right there.

1112
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:03,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1113
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:07,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also kind of go, well, how can you troll people in Nintendo games?

1114
01:23:07,647 --> 01:23:10,729
[SPEAKER_04]: That would mean that it has to have robust online support.

1115
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the handful of games that probably have that.

1116
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1117
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:17,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1118
01:23:18,323 --> 01:23:24,046
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, I'm sure Nintendo will go after YouTubers having Nintendo characters doing and saying inappropriate things.

1119
01:23:24,226 --> 01:23:24,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.

1120
01:23:25,327 --> 01:23:25,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.

1121
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:26,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1122
01:23:27,788 --> 01:23:27,988
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1123
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:28,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on.

1124
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:29,069
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1125
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:36,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have some opinions about this, but I'm overall kind of happy about it.

1126
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:49,791
[SPEAKER_07]: SNK announced ACA Neo Geo Selection Volume 1 and Volume 2 for Switch, both to be released on December 12th in Japan for 5,940 yen each.

1127
01:23:54,494 --> 01:23:58,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So about 50 bucks around there.

1128
01:23:59,175 --> 01:24:04,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They will have 10 games that were also previously released digitally as ACA Neo Geo titles.

1129
01:24:06,557 --> 01:24:11,999
[SPEAKER_07]: The orders are up on Amazon Japan and by camera as well.

1130
01:24:13,139 --> 01:24:20,401
[SPEAKER_07]: The titles in the first one are Baseball Stars Professional, Fatal Fury 2, or Garou Densetsu 2.

1131
01:24:23,421 --> 01:24:49,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Ghost Pilots, Metal Slug 4, Mutation Nation, Neo Turf Masters, Samurai Shodown, or Samurai Spirits Shock Troopers, Second Squad, Sticks Winner 2, King of Fighters 95 and then the second one is Alpha Mission 2, Garou, Mark of the Wolves Metal Slug X, Riding Hero, Samurai Shodown 5, Savage Rain, Shock Troopers, King of Fighters 94 Top Hunter, Roddy and Kathy, and Top Players Golf

1132
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't you just take the good ones and put them on one game?

1133
01:24:58,402 --> 01:25:21,774
[SPEAKER_07]: of course that's subjective but I mean it's a really good collection I mean the the ones in there that I'm I would say most interested in um I mean I've got a bajillion copies of Summer Showdown I have it on Neo Geo but Summer Showdown 5 would be fun to have as well as the Metal Slug games um I've got Garou Mark of the Wolves on Dreamcast um but that would also be fun

1134
01:25:22,834 --> 01:25:29,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little disappointed to not see either of the Last Blade titles in here I love Last Blade

1135
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:58,526
[SPEAKER_07]: but I mean Shock Troopers in there as well I mean I freaking love Shock Troopers and the King of Fighters games although why King of Fighters 2000 isn't in there because that is like I'd say probably among the best of the King of Fighters games I think some of it could be also because the Arcade Archives has tons of games and some of them might be piecemealed already I'm not sure what is and isn't available as a standalone I was just seeing what my preference would have been yeah I know I get it I get it so

1136
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: all hope may not be lost if you're looking for some of those games it just might cost you more that's the bummer yeah maybe a few hundred dollars for buying a cartridge yeah yeah all right uh let's move on Loki yeah so uh Sony seems to have um

1137
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,621
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1138
01:26:44,058 --> 01:26:51,740
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they announced in their blog on the 5th, Sony did, that they're celebrating the 30 years of PlayStation.

1139
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that, there's a graphic that says, you know, PlayStation 30th anniversary.

1140
01:26:56,501 --> 01:27:03,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has the PlayStation logo, including the, you know, triangle, circle, X, or cross and square.

1141
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And those images are made up of...

1142
01:27:08,363 --> 01:27:31,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Silhouettes of different consoles and peripherals and one of those appears to be the PlayStation 5 Pro because the PlayStation 5 Pro had these diagonal grills on the side of the console and it is clearly visible actually right next to the PlayStation logo itself on the blog post image.

1143
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:36,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also on Instagram as well in the circle on the right hand side.

1144
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that does confirm that that is what the console looks like.

1145
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:49,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So assuming that this is going to be starting here, I think this week is when they're going to start announcing all the different things for the... Oh, I'm sorry.

1146
01:27:49,563 --> 01:27:54,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, PlayStation tournaments are going to do those the 21st through the 22nd.

1147
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:58,165
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's going to be some other things, I think, happening leading up to that.

1148
01:27:58,245 --> 01:28:00,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll get an announcement here very soon.

1149
01:28:01,294 --> 01:28:10,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, rumors are in the next couple weeks and you know, Apple's got a big thing tomorrow, you know, this could be an interesting week of tech announcements.

1150
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember September outside of the Apple thing which is usually like clockwork the week after Labor Day.

1151
01:28:16,663 --> 01:28:20,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think about like other tech companies doing their announcements.

1152
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:22,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Tokyo Game Show?

1153
01:28:22,574 --> 01:28:24,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right, of course, Tokyo Game Show.

1154
01:28:26,256 --> 01:28:27,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's towards the end of the month.

1155
01:28:27,617 --> 01:28:31,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to look up the actual dates, but maybe you're right.

1156
01:28:31,419 --> 01:28:34,040
[SPEAKER_03]: It is September 26th through the 29th.

1157
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that could be that it's going to be timed with Tokyo Game Show.

1158
01:28:38,002 --> 01:28:38,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make a lot of sense.

1159
01:28:40,764 --> 01:28:47,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's actually, if we can, DarkSakura, if you're prepared to do it, let's skip to your story next because it's actually a little closer to what Loki just talked about.

1160
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:48,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes more sense to go to that.

1161
01:28:50,231 --> 01:28:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I guess.

1162
01:28:52,893 --> 01:29:00,760
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Sony did share some early glimpses at their 30th anniversary plans.

1163
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, Loki was bringing up the PS5 Pro.

1164
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:10,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the other stuff that's going on is that, first of all, there was...

1165
01:29:11,969 --> 01:29:24,602
[SPEAKER_07]: the Astrobots central hub where the bots that you've saved you can make them dance in like a little lobby area with the 30th anniversary logo.

1166
01:29:26,084 --> 01:29:34,192
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also My First Gran Turismo which is a trial version to I guess attract people to Gran Turismo 7.

1167
01:29:35,794 --> 01:29:48,093
[SPEAKER_07]: um there's also digital game soundtracks for uh looks like God of War, God of War 2, God of War Ghost of Sparta, Twisted Metal, Starhawk, Warhawk and Unit 13 um

1168
01:29:52,357 --> 01:30:15,602
[SPEAKER_07]: there's also then Shapes of Play there are three different kinds of products there is the Shape of Play Battle which is a board game that you can challenge your friend to line up four different shapes of the same color on the board to win I don't know, is that like Go?

1169
01:30:15,962 --> 01:30:16,402
[SPEAKER_07]: or something.

1170
01:30:16,722 --> 01:30:16,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1171
01:30:18,683 --> 01:30:26,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Shapes of Play Create that's magnetic blocks that you position to make drawings or stuff.

1172
01:30:26,727 --> 01:30:28,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do these when I was a kid with wood blocks.

1173
01:30:30,289 --> 01:30:36,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Shapes of Play Recharge where you can, as I say, experience a new way to recharge between games.

1174
01:30:37,853 --> 01:30:39,734
[SPEAKER_07]: They look like squishy toys, I think.

1175
01:30:40,074 --> 01:30:40,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1176
01:30:42,553 --> 01:30:54,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Those will launch in December 2024 through direct.playstation.com in US, UK, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Benelux.

1177
01:30:56,163 --> 01:31:01,007
[SPEAKER_07]: The pre-orders are also starting today through PlayStation Direct.

1178
01:31:02,188 --> 01:31:13,341
[SPEAKER_07]: and then not to mention the free online multiplayer weekend September 21st to 22nd and it looks like that's going to be FC24, NBA 2K25 and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

1179
01:31:18,648 --> 01:31:19,468
[SPEAKER_07]: from the looks of it.

1180
01:31:19,989 --> 01:31:43,610
[SPEAKER_07]: There are going to be some tournaments in the games I mentioned before as well as Tekken 8 and Guilty Gear Strive and other sports titles and avatars that are just a full-on black and white PlayStation 30th anniversary and then another with the colors from the PlayStation logo with like a

1181
01:31:44,711 --> 01:31:50,137
[SPEAKER_07]: The button symbol items on the background behind it saying PlayStation 30th anniversary.

1182
01:31:50,637 --> 01:31:58,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just occurred to me that the colors from the PlayStation are very similar to the colors for the Super Famicom.

1183
01:32:00,151 --> 01:32:03,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Different shade of green, but that blue, yellow, and red?

1184
01:32:03,453 --> 01:32:03,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1185
01:32:04,234 --> 01:32:04,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar.

1186
01:32:05,175 --> 01:32:06,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, with the history and all.

1187
01:32:07,096 --> 01:32:09,558
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's interesting they didn't distance it further, you know?

1188
01:32:09,678 --> 01:32:12,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fresh in my head because I literally just did my business cards.

1189
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:13,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, funny.

1190
01:32:13,741 --> 01:32:17,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And I sampled the same colors from that Thoma composter.

1191
01:32:18,064 --> 01:32:18,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, funny.

1192
01:32:19,622 --> 01:32:19,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1193
01:32:20,443 --> 01:32:22,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it sounds like they got a lot kind of going on there.

1194
01:32:22,624 --> 01:32:26,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, it just, you know, has that moment of, oh, the PlayStation is turning 30.

1195
01:32:27,768 --> 01:32:28,569
[SPEAKER_04]: How old am I?

1196
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:29,749
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that whole thing.

1197
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like they got a lot of fun stuff going on.

1198
01:32:32,531 --> 01:32:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So it almost seems like for sure they'll do more announcements.

1199
01:32:35,954 --> 01:32:41,298
[SPEAKER_07]: How I didn't have worse motion sickness playing through Jumping Flash that many times.

1200
01:32:43,526 --> 01:33:00,469
[SPEAKER_07]: but you know the original PlayStation gave us actually I take that back I think it was the Saturn it was either PlayStation or Saturn version I don't remember but in Toshinden there was the the monkey and when he won he did the butt monkey dance so he was the butt monkey

1201
01:33:01,798 --> 01:33:02,158
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1202
01:33:02,298 --> 01:33:06,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe maybe when you win in this fighting game, you'll do a butt monkey dance.

1203
01:33:06,802 --> 01:33:10,384
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the Capcom fighting game collections we were talking about earlier in the show.

1204
01:33:10,444 --> 01:33:14,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mentioned that Xbox is going to be happening, but it's a little bit different.

1205
01:33:14,768 --> 01:33:20,712
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because when these games were first announced, both the Marvel versus Capcom fighting collection, which I think is out next week.

1206
01:33:21,453 --> 01:33:23,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, September 12th for most people.

1207
01:33:23,734 --> 01:33:44,885
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Capcom Fighting Collection 2 which was just announced we haven't heard anything about what is going to happen with Xbox but we got some clarity on that this week and we know that Capcom will be releasing Xbox One version notice that's Xbox One versions not series but I'm assuming that of course the series will play the Xbox One of course as it does most of the games there

1208
01:33:45,925 --> 01:33:58,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So they announced in an update, Capcom, that we are excited to announce that after technical discussions with our partners at Microsoft, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 will release on Xbox One.

1209
01:33:58,568 --> 01:34:01,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Both versions will arrive in 2025.

1210
01:34:01,908 --> 01:34:03,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be a little bit of a wait.

1211
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:09,430
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if you're looking forward to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, you can get that on PS4.

1212
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Switch, and PC on September 12th.

1213
01:34:13,153 --> 01:34:16,316
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a physical edition on November 22nd.

1214
01:34:16,376 --> 01:34:23,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom Fighting Collection 2 is already going to be in 2025, so maybe we'll get a little closer to the actual date there.

1215
01:34:23,763 --> 01:34:28,267
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were not already aware of what is coming out in Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection...

1216
01:34:28,627 --> 01:34:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna take you for a ride

1217
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:47,670
[SPEAKER_04]: and The Punisher.

1218
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:59,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all the games that will be in that collection that is out next week if you're buying it digitally, which I imagine most people are probably just going to go ahead and pick that up unless you're really big on the physical collection stuff, which maybe some of you are.

1219
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1220
01:35:02,076 --> 01:35:05,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Loki, let's go to a game that never ends.

1221
01:35:05,717 --> 01:35:06,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And boy, it makes me happy.

1222
01:35:07,658 --> 01:35:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1223
01:35:08,498 --> 01:35:14,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So No Man's Sky has added yet another update, the Aquarius update.

1224
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And in it, it adds fishing.

1225
01:35:17,352 --> 01:35:18,713
[SPEAKER_03]: because everybody loves fishing.

1226
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:21,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone does fishing in Animal Crossing.

1227
01:35:21,876 --> 01:35:22,756
[SPEAKER_03]: They do fishing.

1228
01:35:23,757 --> 01:35:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, everything.

1229
01:35:25,598 --> 01:35:26,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Every game has fishing in it now.

1230
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:28,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they didn't add with a name like that?

1231
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not add, this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius.

1232
01:35:34,425 --> 01:35:35,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been the trailer.

1233
01:35:35,246 --> 01:35:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1234
01:35:35,766 --> 01:35:35,946
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1235
01:35:36,006 --> 01:35:37,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft got the Beatles?

1236
01:35:37,468 --> 01:35:38,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why can't we?

1237
01:35:38,809 --> 01:35:39,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1238
01:35:40,871 --> 01:35:44,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure that was well worth the money for that trailer.

1239
01:35:46,055 --> 01:35:50,839
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but yeah, it's going to be, they have lots of different fish you can catch.

1240
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:56,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can actually fish off of your spacecraft as well, which is really cool.

1241
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:00,647
[SPEAKER_03]: You can create your own diving suit.

1242
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:08,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a catalog for the fish that you catch, as well as a special Aquarius fishing expedition or expeditions, maybe.

1243
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, very exciting.

1244
01:36:12,151 --> 01:36:22,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, this is a game that came out years ago and they are still providing... Got dunked on by the entire internet and all these years later out of pure spite, they have continued.

1245
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can appreciate that, to be honest.

1246
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:28,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I applaud them for spite-based motivations.

1247
01:36:28,184 --> 01:36:30,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, quite the opposite of spite in all seriousness with this.

1248
01:36:30,546 --> 01:36:35,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you heard, do you know where the inspiration for this update came from, actually?

1249
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:39,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean Murray, I think, mentioned it, is that there's actually a piece of fan art

1250
01:36:40,154 --> 01:36:46,977
[SPEAKER_04]: that showed a traveler fishing off the side of the ship into the ocean like it was just a fan art somebody did.

1251
01:36:47,357 --> 01:36:50,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sean Murray or somebody at Hello Games saw that and went, you know what?

1252
01:36:51,379 --> 01:36:51,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1253
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:53,060
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do that.

1254
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:53,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1255
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:54,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1256
01:36:55,221 --> 01:36:59,242
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were to guess, and this is probably a little bit more like, oh, that makes sense.

1257
01:36:59,623 --> 01:37:02,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have a new game coming out, right?

1258
01:37:02,664 --> 01:37:04,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That game probably has fishing in it.

1259
01:37:05,672 --> 01:37:06,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

1260
01:37:07,094 --> 01:37:07,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this works here.

1261
01:37:08,135 --> 01:37:09,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's build this and bring it over.

1262
01:37:09,556 --> 01:37:12,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this mean I should finally play my copy of the game?

1263
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:12,960
[SPEAKER_08]: You really should.

1264
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:13,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the game.

1265
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, well, no, I was going to say you can switch between first person and over the shoulder and you can even do it in the spaceship.

1266
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can do third person spaceship too.

1267
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:23,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So, actually, you should be fine with it.

1268
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:25,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, you should play it.

1269
01:37:26,527 --> 01:37:26,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

1270
01:37:27,207 --> 01:37:30,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can turn off, if you don't want to fight things, just turn it off.

1271
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to fight things.

1272
01:37:32,591 --> 01:37:33,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to explore.

1273
01:37:34,692 --> 01:37:35,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to explore.

1274
01:37:35,953 --> 01:37:37,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the best part.

1275
01:37:38,054 --> 01:37:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I miss playing Star Trek Online.

1276
01:37:41,776 --> 01:37:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I left my character parked at Quarks and would just play there for hours.

1277
01:37:46,459 --> 01:37:48,701
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you already have a copy of the game, Jamie?

1278
01:37:48,861 --> 01:37:49,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1279
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:53,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because they say if you don't, 60% off until September 9th.

1280
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:55,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's till tomorrow.

1281
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:56,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it after they re-released it.

1282
01:37:56,988 --> 01:37:57,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1283
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:58,552
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1284
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:07,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another game that's probably in some of your backlogs that you need to catch up on, I think, is Baldur's Gate 3, which we talked about earlier.

1285
01:38:07,629 --> 01:38:14,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, while I was doing this awesome voice acting panel, and not just me, actually.

1286
01:38:14,275 --> 01:38:16,997
[SPEAKER_04]: The Baldur's Gate crew was doing a panel every day.

1287
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:20,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Garrett Wong interviewed them on Friday, which I thought was really funny.

1288
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:24,644
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, for those of you that know the history of this show, you're going to find this funny.

1289
01:38:25,425 --> 01:38:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I run into Garrett Wong in the halls of DragonCon, as sometimes people do, and I looked him right in the eye and said, hey, Garrett, how was Curacao?

1290
01:38:34,349 --> 01:38:42,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And he looks back at me and he goes, oh, yeah, yeah, Curacao, wow, people remember that that was the thing, yeah, great, it was great, thanks, and walked on by to his stand.

1291
01:38:42,894 --> 01:38:49,537
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't fucking remember watching me fucking, I could, I literally almost died in front of Garrett Wong and he forgot.

1292
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:49,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1293
01:38:51,704 --> 01:38:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: He probably saves people all the time.

1294
01:38:53,165 --> 01:38:53,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1295
01:38:53,985 --> 01:38:55,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And still won't fucking get promoted.

1296
01:38:57,007 --> 01:38:59,408
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why you're not getting promoted, sir.

1297
01:38:59,428 --> 01:39:00,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because of your memory.

1298
01:39:00,349 --> 01:39:00,829
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

1299
01:39:01,389 --> 01:39:02,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the last one to complain.

1300
01:39:02,590 --> 01:39:03,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1301
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I get it.

1302
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1303
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:05,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Busy, con.

1304
01:39:06,052 --> 01:39:11,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I caught him in between point A to B. Not the greatest time to talk to somebody, but I had to take my shot.

1305
01:39:12,235 --> 01:39:16,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to ask him, and he didn't fucking remember me almost dying in front of him.

1306
01:39:16,437 --> 01:39:16,898
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1307
01:39:17,018 --> 01:39:17,438
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1308
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:19,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to just try again sometime.

1309
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,140
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1310
01:39:22,193 --> 01:39:24,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, in all seriousness, let's go back to Baldur's Gate 3.

1311
01:39:25,036 --> 01:39:29,000
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was doing that panel and other folks, you know, DragonCon were doing PAX...

1312
01:39:31,219 --> 01:39:46,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Patch 7 is coming out this week for Baldur's Gate and it is going to be making mods official.

1313
01:39:46,926 --> 01:39:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It is through an official mod.io powered so it's running through that site.

1314
01:39:52,588 --> 01:39:54,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Mod Manager will work with this.

1315
01:39:55,876 --> 01:40:10,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Larian does say we're not going to prevent modding outside of our own official pipeline but only the approved mods will be targeted for stability and cross-platform compatibility so I'm sorry if you have salacious nudie mods

1316
01:40:11,222 --> 01:40:17,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not going to be, you can have them, but Larian doesn't want to touch them and put them in the game and make sure they're cross platform.

1317
01:40:17,648 --> 01:40:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Other things maybe will be there.

1318
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:28,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Larian also says it'll ensure a smoother experience at the cost of more script focused modding, which can still be done outside of our pipeline.

1319
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

1320
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so check that out.

1321
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:35,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mac will also be getting patch seven, but that won't be out until October.

1322
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:37,261
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a little bit of a delay there.

1323
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:44,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, cross platform save compatibility will also release in October when every device gets that patch.

1324
01:40:44,903 --> 01:40:49,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be consoles are actually getting that in October as well, but I believe PC is getting it this week.

1325
01:40:49,444 --> 01:40:51,044
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can kind of jump in and check that out.

1326
01:40:51,704 --> 01:40:54,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm sure a lot of people very excited to do that.

1327
01:40:55,305 --> 01:40:55,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

1328
01:40:57,023 --> 01:40:58,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Not DLC.

1329
01:40:58,123 --> 01:41:00,104
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just, you know, extra stuff.

1330
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar to the game we were just talking about, No Man's Sky.

1331
01:41:03,445 --> 01:41:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that makes a lot of people very, very happy.

1332
01:41:06,825 --> 01:41:07,065
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1333
01:41:07,185 --> 01:41:10,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get into our next segment, we usually get into the classic game of the week here.

1334
01:41:11,066 --> 01:41:13,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a little bit of housekeeping that's a little bit strange.

1335
01:41:14,207 --> 01:41:18,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So we keep a log of the classic game of the week.

1336
01:41:19,428 --> 01:41:25,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty much every episode the show has ever done has been kept by fans on our Orange Launch Radio wiki.

1337
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,250
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya

1338
01:41:49,265 --> 01:42:09,245
[SPEAKER_04]: uh loyal and brave and probably the most frequent contributor to the wiki alongside with Orange Rite I think did a lot too has actually filed an appeal uh to figure out what the hell's going on so my hope is that fandom will bring it back at least we were able to download archives you can download everything so if it doesn't come back

1339
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:11,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fandom's kind of, eh.

1340
01:42:37,512 --> 01:42:38,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the thing.

1341
01:42:38,473 --> 01:42:39,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give them one chance.

1342
01:42:40,435 --> 01:42:43,659
[SPEAKER_04]: If they don't bring the wiki back, we'll do it somewhere else.

1343
01:42:43,939 --> 01:42:49,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to volunteer something because a lot of the web work is on Bobby to do.

1344
01:42:50,306 --> 01:42:52,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's a lot of work, I don't want to volunteer him to do it.

1345
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:55,012
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's something where we can like...

1346
01:42:55,945 --> 01:43:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Unpack a wiki shell on the server somewhere and let you guys turn you loose, then great.

1347
01:43:00,649 --> 01:43:01,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be awesome.

1348
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:04,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But if that's not possible, then there's alternatives I've heard about.

1349
01:43:04,252 --> 01:43:04,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll look into that.

1350
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:07,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a lot of you aren't big fans of fandom anyway.

1351
01:43:07,534 --> 01:43:11,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's their one chance to not burn this fucking bridge forever.

1352
01:43:12,218 --> 01:43:13,219
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear me, fandom?

1353
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't burn this bridge.

1354
01:43:15,633 --> 01:43:31,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to say that the Minecraft wiki, which was originally on Fandom, moved off of Fandom several months ago because it was bad as far as stuff being broken all the time, ads, malware, stuff like that.

1355
01:43:32,347 --> 01:43:37,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we'll see what happens, but yes, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki for now is down.

1356
01:43:37,809 --> 01:43:40,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately this game will not be able to get tracked today.

1357
01:43:40,729 --> 01:43:42,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to use pen and paper.

1358
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:46,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to open a OneNote notebook or something else.

1359
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:55,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I don't know, maybe we keep a log on Discord somewhere, but we'll have to just note this somewhere else until we hopefully get the Wiki back in the next week.

1360
01:43:55,094 --> 01:43:56,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if not, fandom.

1361
01:43:56,914 --> 01:43:57,875
[SPEAKER_04]: The classic game page.

1362
01:43:58,155 --> 01:43:58,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1363
01:43:58,696 --> 01:44:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll try to get that restored somewhere.

1364
01:44:01,379 --> 01:44:05,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But just a heads up, that's a difficulty we're dealing with right now.

1365
01:44:05,843 --> 01:44:06,124
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1366
01:44:06,904 --> 01:44:14,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, let's move on to our classic game of the week segment with, of course, the bumper.

1367
01:44:24,918 --> 01:44:32,221
[SPEAKER_05]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1368
01:44:32,681 --> 01:44:35,642
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1369
01:44:35,842 --> 01:44:43,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but once a month DarkSakura likes to put a twist on this segment and do a classic cancelled game.

1370
01:44:43,805 --> 01:44:47,426
[SPEAKER_04]: One that we never actually got to play, but the proof exists out there.

1371
01:44:47,726 --> 01:44:50,167
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic cancelled game of the month?

1372
01:44:51,788 --> 01:44:52,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the...

1373
01:44:53,584 --> 01:45:07,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I did mention the Dreamcast earlier, which I think would be absolutely, you know, it's not one of the best systems that ever was, but the game I picked was called Propeller Arena Aviation Battle Championship.

1374
01:45:08,749 --> 01:45:15,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It was originally called Propellerhead Online, and it was meant to be released on September 19th, 2001.

1375
01:45:15,251 --> 01:45:15,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the date sink in.

1376
01:45:20,307 --> 01:45:29,315
[SPEAKER_07]: The game was trademarked on April 14th, 2001, developed and completed by Sega AM2, but the game never got an official release.

1377
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:30,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cancelled.

1378
01:45:31,838 --> 01:45:32,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Why was it cancelled?

1379
01:45:32,919 --> 01:45:34,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone want to hazard a guess?

1380
01:45:37,643 --> 01:45:37,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone?

1381
01:45:39,365 --> 01:45:41,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It was right after the September 11th attacks.

1382
01:45:42,990 --> 01:46:11,009
[SPEAKER_07]: so they were citing similarities in the game packaging and design as the events and the Dreamcast declining market share so it was on display at E3 on May 19, 2001 and it was postponed to work on the cover art and tweak some of those images out of and I mean

1383
01:46:13,027 --> 01:46:20,731
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted to port it to another system, but never did, and the disc image of the game did eventually get leaked.

1384
01:46:21,871 --> 01:46:32,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So, basically, there's an air combat tournament in 2045 using planes from the World War II era, and you participate in the tournament.

1385
01:46:33,857 --> 01:46:36,358
[SPEAKER_07]: It is basically dogfight deathmatches.

1386
01:46:37,409 --> 01:46:38,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You have four modes.

1387
01:46:38,909 --> 01:46:41,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You have Championship, where you have a sequence of dogfights.

1388
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:43,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick Battle, which is a single.

1389
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:47,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Training Arena, where you learn you have minigames.

1390
01:46:47,252 --> 01:46:48,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Network to play online.

1391
01:46:49,812 --> 01:46:54,714
[SPEAKER_07]: When you beat the game or training levels, you get other characters and levels.

1392
01:46:55,694 --> 01:46:59,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had forced feedback via the Dreamcast Jump Pack.

1393
01:47:01,085 --> 01:47:09,590
[SPEAKER_07]: The soundtrack had elements of punk rock, and it was created by both branches of Sega.

1394
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:13,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The Japanese team had 13 songs composed and produced in-house.

1395
01:47:14,273 --> 01:47:24,499
[SPEAKER_07]: An American team worked with Fat Wreck Chords label to license nine songs from Consumed, Zero Dawn, No Use for a Name, Mad Caddies, and Rise Against.

1396
01:47:25,919 --> 01:47:35,462
[SPEAKER_07]: and some of Sega's original songs that did get remixed as instrumentals and reused in Virtua Tennis 3 that came out in 2006.

1397
01:47:39,783 --> 01:47:41,763
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really all I can say about the game.

1398
01:47:41,843 --> 01:47:43,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a complete game.

1399
01:47:43,144 --> 01:47:44,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find the disc image out there.

1400
01:47:50,465 --> 01:47:52,886
[SPEAKER_09]: If you play it, let me know how you like it.

1401
01:47:55,817 --> 01:47:56,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Shameless Cats.

1402
01:47:57,198 --> 01:47:58,098
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be my team.

1403
01:47:58,839 --> 01:47:59,279
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1404
01:47:59,519 --> 01:48:00,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Propeller Arena.

1405
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,521
[SPEAKER_04]: The classic game of the week.

1406
01:48:03,382 --> 01:48:03,742
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1407
01:48:04,322 --> 01:48:07,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people in chat giving their opinions on that as well.

1408
01:48:07,664 --> 01:48:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun fun.

1409
01:48:09,986 --> 01:48:10,446
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1410
01:48:11,987 --> 01:48:19,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back to some news that we're going to cover real fast in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1411
01:48:20,472 --> 01:48:21,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we'll go to you and start.

1412
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're muted, just heads up

1413
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of fun.

1414
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:34,704
[SPEAKER_03]: In the vein of the Commodore 64 Mini, we have now the Spectrum Mini.

1415
01:48:35,544 --> 01:48:41,667
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Spectrum Mini is a console I'm not too familiar with because I never really got to play a ZX Spectrum.

1416
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But this new mini console does actually emulate the ZX Spectrum, the 48 and the 128 models.

1417
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:50,711
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got 48 games built in.

1418
01:48:55,833 --> 01:49:20,994
[SPEAKER_03]: and includes even um well they have like the hobbit maniac miner head over heels as well as even some homebrew games in there as well a bunch of different you know options that you would expect with like one of these consoles including you know the crt filters the 4x3 aspect ratio um you can also load a usb drive with roms and play them in there as well

1419
01:49:21,839 --> 01:49:29,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It even includes, I think this is kind of one of the coolest parts about it, is a 32-page Crash magazine, a mini-mag.

1420
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It has, like, reviews from the older games, I guess, original game reviews and stuff.

1421
01:49:36,269 --> 01:49:37,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's pretty cool as well.

1422
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:39,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have programs you can type in, too?

1423
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:48,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it's got a full keyboard that's replicated from the original console, so pretty cool.

1424
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:54,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be coming out on November 22nd, so keep an eye on that.

1425
01:49:56,451 --> 01:50:03,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, speaking of old things that are new again, we have a NES version of a Rugrats game coming out.

1426
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:04,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know.

1427
01:50:04,673 --> 01:50:05,373
[SPEAKER_03]: What year is it?

1428
01:50:06,233 --> 01:50:11,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Rugrats Adventures in Game Land is an old yet new game.

1429
01:50:11,895 --> 01:50:14,676
[SPEAKER_03]: It's launching on all the consoles.

1430
01:50:15,836 --> 01:50:18,597
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC.

1431
01:50:19,217 --> 01:50:23,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox One, Xbox Series will be coming, I think, a little bit later.

1432
01:50:24,678 --> 01:50:34,547
[SPEAKER_03]: but this week though on the 10th is when they'll be launching there I hear actually on Epic Game Store I believe this game is going to be free as one of their games that's going to be coming out I looked today

1433
01:50:35,871 --> 01:50:58,509
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's pretty cool and yeah they even have on the modern console versions they're going to have an HD overlay as well that makes the game look like the cartoon yeah you can play it as NES and it looks kind of like DuckTales Remastered sort of thing where like you can well in DuckTales Remastered you can flip back and forth maybe like Wonder Boy the trap that one

1434
01:50:59,420 --> 01:50:59,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1435
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:00,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon's Trap.

1436
01:51:00,881 --> 01:51:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think it's pretty cool, though, because, like, I remember, like, back in the Nintendo days and stuff, it's like, we wouldn't necessarily go, oh, it's a Rugrats game.

1437
01:51:08,123 --> 01:51:14,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be like, you know, a lot of those, like, tie-in games were pretty good.

1438
01:51:14,405 --> 01:51:16,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the games based off TV shows and stuff.

1439
01:51:17,006 --> 01:51:21,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, remember, like, oh, Real Monsters, and, like, they had the Simpsons games and stuff like that.

1440
01:51:21,128 --> 01:51:25,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of the Simpsons games weren't so good, but, you know, some of the games were good.

1441
01:51:26,649 --> 01:51:28,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, this is exciting, so...

1442
01:51:28,973 --> 01:51:29,273
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1443
01:51:45,555 --> 01:52:02,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I do indeed so um Konami is saying stay tuned uh with uh information for Metal Gear Solid 4 um this is for the remaster of Silent uh I said Silent Hill didn't I?

1444
01:52:02,523 --> 01:52:03,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Gear Solid 4 um

1445
01:52:06,201 --> 01:52:15,745
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a conversation with Okamura Noriaki, who is the Konami producer for all the Metal Gear Solid stuff.

1446
01:52:16,946 --> 01:52:24,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said that they are aware of the situation where Metal Gear Solid 4 is not playable on current platforms.

1447
01:52:24,909 --> 01:52:30,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And he hinted that the game might be included in the yet-to-be-announced Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2.

1448
01:52:32,681 --> 01:52:33,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read the exact quote.

1449
01:52:33,782 --> 01:52:36,443
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely are aware of the situation with MGS4.

1450
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:41,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, we can't really say too much at the moment with Volume 1 containing Metal Gear Solid 1 through 3 dot dot dot.

1451
01:52:42,306 --> 01:52:43,947
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably connect the dots.

1452
01:52:44,487 --> 01:52:51,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, we still are internally concerned about what we should be doing for the future of the series.

1453
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:55,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So sorry, we can't really reveal anything to you at the moment, but stay tuned.

1454
01:52:56,391 --> 01:52:59,233
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be those acid games that were on PSP at some point too.

1455
01:52:59,494 --> 01:53:01,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure could round out a collection like that.

1456
01:53:01,836 --> 01:53:03,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So be interesting.

1457
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:04,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

1458
01:53:05,404 --> 01:53:25,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, unfortunately in sadder news, and really this actually is the last story we have slotted tonight, even though it's rapid-fire news, but on a sad note, Andrew C. Greenberg, who was the co-creator of the series Wizardry, which of course is an infamous series of RPGs, unfortunately passed away at the age of 67.

1459
01:53:25,978 --> 01:53:31,801
[SPEAKER_04]: This news was shared to Facebook by his collaborator from the Wizardry days, Robert Woodhead.

1460
01:53:33,402 --> 01:54:01,415
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously huge influence on RPGs especially in that early PC era I believe this game was remade just recently Digital Eclipse did a very recent remaster of the first game so if you haven't experienced this game you can do it in classic form or in this more modern form with what Digital Eclipse put out so very sad to hear that he has passed but obviously the legacy lives on which you know

1461
01:54:02,458 --> 01:54:03,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Wizardry was huge in this.

1462
01:54:03,699 --> 01:54:16,045
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you want to know some of the inspiration, a tweet in 2022 written by Yuji Horii, the creator of Dragon Quest, has cited Wizardry as primary inspiration.

1463
01:54:16,085 --> 01:54:24,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that tweet, talked about meeting Robert Woodhead for the first time, saying, when I think back, it all started 40 years ago when I really got into Wizardry.

1464
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:28,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have that game to thank an awful lot.

1465
01:54:29,533 --> 01:54:30,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest in peace.

1466
01:54:31,144 --> 01:54:38,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's travel around the world real quick and check out some release dates of maybe some new games that Wizardry has inspired or otherwise.

1494
01:58:17,433 --> 01:58:17,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I was.

1495
01:58:17,873 --> 01:58:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sitting all night on that joke.

1496
01:58:19,034 --> 01:58:19,294
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1497
01:58:20,155 --> 01:58:25,198

1498
01:58:25,838 --> 01:58:30,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure exactly what this game is, but it looks a little bit like an old school dungeon crawler type of game.

1499
01:58:30,341 --> 01:58:34,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it might be cute and something like up my alley because it also has puzzle elements in it for whatever reason.

1500
01:58:35,045 --> 01:58:36,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm always down with that.

1501
01:58:36,546 --> 01:58:37,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can check that out.

1502
01:58:38,247 --> 01:58:45,972

[SPEAKER_04]: all out this week on the Switch.

01:58:48,234 --> 01:58:55,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, on the PlayStation 5, we have... Ooh, Test Drive Unlimited, Solar Crown is out this week.

1505
01:58:55,622 --> 01:59:01,569
[SPEAKER_04]: The Test Drive series, somehow still not killed off by a bunch of mediocre releases over the years.

1506
01:59:02,009 --> 01:59:02,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe...

1507
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:04,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Just maybe this one will break the curse.

1508
01:59:05,191 --> 01:59:07,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It does look nice in screenshots, I will say.

1509
01:59:07,393 --> 01:59:09,774
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how that looks when it actually comes out.

1510
01:59:10,215 --> 01:59:16,278
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, speaking of like the spectrum and games I was playing in the Commodore 64 era, the original test drive was one of them.

1511
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:19,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is out on the PlayStation 5 this week.

1512
01:59:20,441 --> 01:59:21,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check out Europe, DarkSakura.

1562
02:03:09,267 --> 02:03:19,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a super massive game set in... Well, the thing with Dead by Daylight is that it touches different universes or different versions of universes and everything.

1563
02:03:20,856 --> 02:03:21,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1564
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:48,663
[SPEAKER_07]: you can um it starts with like a little bit of time travel and story and you were i mean every i'm sure people who care have seen the demo by now where you play the police officer rescuing the baby um from frank stone um and then it's what happened to frank stone where is he where's the spirits things like that and and how does the entity play into all of this

1565
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:52,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead by Daylight for the game to still make sense, right?

1566
02:03:52,944 --> 02:03:53,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_04]: Wake me when it actually is sitting on a shelf somewhere.

1570
02:04:44,121 --> 02:04:44,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a while.

1571
02:04:44,861 --> 02:04:45,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whatever.

1572
02:04:45,662 --> 02:04:50,506

1573
02:04:50,967 --> 02:04:51,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care.

1574
02:04:51,727 --> 02:04:52,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, get it right.

1575
02:04:52,468 --> 02:04:53,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck it up.

1576
02:04:53,409 --> 02:04:53,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it right.

1577
02:04:54,330 --> 02:04:54,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1578
02:04:55,905 --> 02:05:02,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well with that then, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought and all that stuff, but I do want to thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1579
02:05:02,352 --> 02:05:05,014
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, help us spread the word.

1580
02:05:05,054 --> 02:05:08,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1581
02:05:08,898 --> 02:05:15,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify, wherever you found this show, those go an awful long way.

1582
02:05:15,765 --> 02:05:17,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate that, but of course, tell a friend.

1583
02:05:17,807 --> 02:05:19,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Word of mouth is always the best.

1584
02:05:19,629 --> 02:05:45,111
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopefully we'll see you at a convention be it DragonCon, TwitchCon or otherwise in the future I actually did see a couple listeners at DragonCon I forgot to give shoutouts earlier but it was great to see folks so yeah it's always lovely and if anyone runs into me at TwitchCon say hi and I take affection in the form of chocolate you can pay tribute that way this is true by the way 100% this is true so

1585
02:05:46,932 --> 02:05:48,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I demand tribute.

1586
02:05:48,712 --> 02:05:48,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Kidding.

1587
02:05:49,492 --> 02:05:52,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially the fancier and more imported, the better.

1588
02:05:53,353 --> 02:05:55,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it has to be extra imported.

1589
02:05:56,674 --> 02:05:57,014
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

1590
02:05:57,174 --> 02:06:00,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to go through several countries and illicit bank accounts.

1591
02:06:00,534 --> 02:06:01,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that place in Chicago I went to?

1592
02:06:01,995 --> 02:06:02,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Vossages?

1593
02:06:02,775 --> 02:06:03,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Vossages.

1594
02:06:03,395 --> 02:06:03,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Vossages.

1595
02:06:04,455 --> 02:06:06,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was some expensive stuff, but it was good.

1596
02:06:07,176 --> 02:06:07,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.

1597
02:06:07,676 --> 02:06:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I get why you have a taste for it.

1598
02:06:09,356 --> 02:06:11,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know me.

1599
02:06:11,856 --> 02:06:14,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's the same thing I applied to alcoholism.

1600
02:06:15,734 --> 02:06:17,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not an alcoholic because I have expensive taste.

1601
02:06:18,056 --> 02:06:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1602
02:06:18,716 --> 02:06:21,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I only drink tequila that is over a certain price.

1603
02:06:21,339 --> 02:06:21,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

1604
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:22,499
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1605
02:06:22,539 --> 02:06:26,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's wrap up and say goodnight.

1606
02:06:26,743 --> 02:06:29,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, I know you're going to be streaming your game tonight, so I'll let you go.

1607
02:06:29,645 --> 02:06:33,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1608
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:38,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I need like five more hours per day that I can use for napping.

1609
02:06:40,054 --> 02:06:40,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear that.

1610
02:06:41,502 --> 02:06:41,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1611
02:06:42,402 --> 02:06:42,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, Jamie.

1612
02:06:42,983 --> 02:06:43,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good stream.

1613
02:06:43,923 --> 02:06:44,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1614
02:06:44,743 --> 02:06:45,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, bye.

1615
02:06:45,984 --> 02:06:48,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Loki, we'll go to you and what's your final thought tonight?

1616
02:06:50,766 --> 02:06:52,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... I have a lot of work to do.

1617
02:06:53,767 --> 02:06:54,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to do work.

1618
02:06:57,147 --> 02:07:20,126
[SPEAKER_04]: my final thought tonight is I can't believe I just got back from DragonCon and now I'm like in Seattle in less than two weeks because unfortunately when you all are at TwitchCon I'm in Seattle for an Ingress related thing but it's gonna be fun I'm not you know I'm not sorry I'm sorry not sorry it'll be fun but I'm sad to miss TwitchCon especially in a year when a lot of y'all are going I think you'll all have a good time so I'm excited for you

1619
02:07:21,366 --> 02:07:23,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear his show, but is Bobby going?

1620
02:07:23,767 --> 02:07:27,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know they're doing the Game Sun Quick X or whatever.

1621
02:07:27,309 --> 02:07:29,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby will not be going to TwitchCon after all.

1622
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:30,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1623
02:07:30,951 --> 02:07:36,173
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think he was not able to get to TwitchCon until after it already started.

1624
02:07:36,553 --> 02:07:40,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that kind of, you know, they needed folks that were going to be available.

1625
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bobby will be here on the network, though, that night.

1626
02:07:43,816 --> 02:07:46,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those of you that need something to listen to in a couple weeks, Bobby will be here.

1627
02:07:46,657 --> 02:07:47,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is that.

1628
02:07:48,318 --> 02:07:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but otherwise, yeah, I'm hoping I get back to some personal streaming this week.

1629
02:07:52,182 --> 02:08:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a minute, but, um, with all the other bullshit going on, uh, hopefully if I have like the hardest part of this Convid stuff, you know, Paxilvid's been keeping most of the symptoms at bay.

1630
02:08:02,753 --> 02:08:06,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the fucking fatigue today has been really bad, but actually like,

1631
02:08:08,291 --> 02:08:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.

1632
02:08:23,624 --> 02:08:28,405
[SPEAKER_04]: with Bobby and I where we will get into all the non-game things that happened too because there was a lot of really cool stuff.

1633
02:08:28,425 --> 02:08:29,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get into all that later this week.

1634
02:08:30,206 --> 02:08:40,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to our Discord for the latest and our socials, especially Blue Sky where you can just find us at vognetwork.com because on Blue Sky you can just have your domain, vognetwork.com.

1635

1636
02:08:42,009 --> 02:08:42,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, hey, it's your domain.

1637
02:08:42,909 --> 02:08:44,630
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right, that's it.
