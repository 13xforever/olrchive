1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:17,122
[SPEAKER_10]: The subheader for one of tonight's stories referring to the PS5 Pro's paid optical disc drive accessory says, The beefed up console is lacking a pretty important feature right out of the box.

2
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:18,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it pretty important?

3
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:24,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe for the now minority of people that want it, who I guess is the article's target audience, physical media is increasingly a minority need.

4
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,784
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want that capability, it's time to pay for it.

5
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:28,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this what being a politician feels like?

6
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:30,185
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my punditry intro.

7
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:34,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somerson, Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:37,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:46,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:58,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1017 of our show for tonight, September the 15th of 2024.

11
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:06,050
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and not joining us at the moment but will be here shortly as on the way is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,411
[SPEAKER_09]: They are running just a little bit behind us.

13
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:30,143
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR will not be here next week because TwitchCon's going on and both you and DarkSakura are going and she's been before and has talked at length about it on the show but this is going to actually be it this is your very first like TwitchCon coming up this weekend like ever right?

14
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ever, yeah.

15
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting.

16
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:33,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

17
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:34,952
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you kind of, like, looking for?

18
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:37,812
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking about you kind of set up an aggressive schedule this week, right?

19
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:38,752
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you looking forward to?

20
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:44,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been trying to, like, plan out my... Because I'm going for all three days and the day before.

21
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right now, I mean, I have a pretty loaded schedule in terms of, like, a lot of stuff surrounding MCC and Nox Crew, so there's a few different...

22
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,657
[SPEAKER_02]: events that I've been invited to.

23
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:04,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Some I don't know what they are, some I do know what they are.

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:14,984
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different meet and greets, different panels that I was going to try to check out, all mostly Minecraft related, except for meet and greet with Doug Doug.

25
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:16,785
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just funny, but...

26
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to be pretty busy.

27
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:27,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And over in our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

28
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,072
[SPEAKER_09]: That's VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

29
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:37,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And the previously mentioned Bobby Blackwolf is in chat saying, wait, you got invited to things at TwitchCon?

30
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen very often.

31
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:40,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

32
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Rolling out the red carpet for Loki's first year.

33
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:51,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one other quick thing I want to ask you about, and then we'll go over to DarkSakura who just joined us.

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:01,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to mention, Loki, the game playing behind you tonight is Astro Bot for the PlayStation 5, which really feels like it's taken the gaming world by storm, quite frankly.

35
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:07,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not picked this game up myself yet because I bought cheaper games this week, but

36
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:14,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, a lot of the hype for this game is really making me go, alright, maybe I do need to pick this up at full price.

37
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:20,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, even though this screams the type of game that Sony would give away in a year on PS Plus, I feel like I need to pick this up right away.

38
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm feeling like this might be a game of the year contender at the Game Awards.

39
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:26,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I really am getting that vibe.

40
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:28,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's looked pretty good.

41
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:34,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I would have picked it up if I had a PlayStation 5, but I don't, so I'm not purchasing a system for this, but...

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good.

43
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like on level with Mario Odyssey or something like that.

44
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:40,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

45
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:45,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're going to have the chance to get a PlayStation 5 for $700, but we'll talk about that in just a little bit.

46
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:49,967
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I want to say hello to, of course, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

47
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope you're doing well tonight, Jamie.

48
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

49
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,314
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not coming through, but sometimes it takes a second to tune in.

50
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,395
[SPEAKER_03]: My microphone is on.

51
00:03:59,435 --> 00:03:59,775
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

52
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:02,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why, but sometimes if it's just a quick high, it doesn't come through, but that's all right.

53
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:03,458
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?

54
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:05,760
[SPEAKER_03]: You also sound like you're talking a thousand miles a minute.

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what else is new?

56
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out, I just had a fresh cup of coffee, so yes.

57
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:21,277
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

58
00:04:40,235 --> 00:05:02,398
[SPEAKER_03]: it's okay it's okay I have been really I don't know what it is I've just been really like having extra fatigue lately yeah and it's been like I've just been like the combination of my week and everything just getting ready for TwitchCon I have been I've been

59
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty poopified.

60
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:06,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I understand.

61
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you hang in there okay.

62
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:14,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you mentioned TwitchCon as well, what does it look like for you?

63
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:16,177
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you excited about for this year's TwitchCon?

64
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:18,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Going.

65
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited about wearing my platform tall heel Crocs.

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

67
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't Crocs a sponsor in Vegas?

68
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:30,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, yep.

69
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:31,906
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I thought.

70
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:32,667
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so funny.

71
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:37,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope they are again so I can go into my Crocs and say, get ready to sponsor me, bitches.

72
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:40,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

73
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:40,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

74
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,817
[SPEAKER_09]: You're cosplaying as well, right?

75
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:46,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm doing two different pig cosmetics.

76
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:53,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing my normal one that I wear with the drill weapon and the red shirt and the crown.

77
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm also doing the outfit that goes with the crown.

78
00:05:56,943 --> 00:06:04,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So the short skirt, the thigh high fishnets, combat boots, the purple shirt from the first movie.

79
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:04,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:19,440
[SPEAKER_03]: and I discovered something Rob something I can get away with instead of having to wear an uncomfortable skirt that I can't move in I'm buying a fucking tennis skirt with like a skort type one with the shorts underneath it oh nice

81
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know what?

82
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Function before fashion when it comes to conventions.

83
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:34,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how some of these Dragon Con, like, you know, which, and I bring that up because obviously it's like a cost, it's cosplay heaven or cosplay hell, depending on how you look at it.

84
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:39,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But Dragon Con, some people go all out and I don't know how they do it because the function.

85
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,287
[SPEAKER_03]: They do it at Anime Cons too.

86
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:45,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a big daddy at TwitchCon two years ago.

87
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:46,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, daddy.

88
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:47,789
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a Reptar.

89
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, what?

90
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Pink elephant is if you're drunk.

91
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:19,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just elephant.

92
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:20,447
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fine.

93
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:26,890
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to address the blue elephant in the room about what's been going on this week.

94
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And you may have seen on social media that it is official.

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:39,516
[SPEAKER_09]: We are in a Guinness publication as the longest running English language magazine.

96
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,175
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

97
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,226
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think they had to, you know, probably research and update a few things.

98
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:33,686
[SPEAKER_09]: but I happened to log into the OLR account because I think there was a gaming news story where there was a headline or something and I saw the little mail icon and I was like, oh, what's this?

99
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I saw what it was, I almost choked.

100
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:46,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So I emailed the individual from Guinness who reached out with some basic information but to be fair, I didn't really know what it was going to be.

101
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,319
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

102
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:04,196
[SPEAKER_09]: and as you all may recall, it changed.

103
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:11,525
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of funny because if we hadn't posted about it on Twitter, the individual may not have seen it and actually changed the date.

104
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:17,833
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's right in the book, but that's only because they changed the date at the literal like last second for them whenever their deadline was.

105
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,490
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

106
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,788
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted something like, can you get us something by tomorrow?

107
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:47,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And I couldn't get the three of us together to take a new picture, and we just didn't have a lot of pictures as a group.

108
00:09:48,135 --> 00:09:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We had only really done two official publicity shoots.

109
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,379
[SPEAKER_09]: There was the one you see in the book.

110
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, that was Mistress Tia that shot that photo from the very last non-to-go edition of OLR ever.

111
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:03,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little fun history there.

112
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Mistress Tia shot that photo.

113
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:22,188
[SPEAKER_09]: and let me think there was one other publicity photo thing we did a few years later with Eddie rest in peace actually came over and shot us you might recall this is when we were in the garage studio on Justin TV and

114
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:35,958
[SPEAKER_09]: and the picture I liked the best from that was the one, so there's a really funny picture of us sitting around the table and like Loki's on an old ass brick laptop, DarkSakura's, no, DarkSakura's on the laptop.

115
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki is talking into an Xbox 360.

116
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,741
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my Toshiba.

117
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:44,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I was playing a Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS, but a DS.

118
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:48,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a big old bottle of Goldschlager on the table.

119
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually don't think that picture would have been suitable for print anyway.

120
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:59,271
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that we sent was easy enough for them to remove the background from.

121
00:10:59,451 --> 00:10:59,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

122
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:01,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So it worked out.

123
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:10,842
[SPEAKER_09]: If we'd known, the funny thing is, you, me, and Loki got together for the 1,000th episode and we took pictures in front of Golf Land and put that on social media.

124
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would have been a great thing to have in the book.

125
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:15,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that was already past their deadline.

126
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is what it is.

127
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:17,667
[SPEAKER_09]: You make do with what you have, right?

128
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:18,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how could we know?

129
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's just, you know, when these things happen, they happen.

130
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't even 100% positive that it was going to be, like, for the longest running, you know, podcast.

131
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:29,473
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought, oh, maybe we'll be just mentioned, like, on a list or something.

132
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:32,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we didn't know if, like, we were like, who else did they contact?

133
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:33,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually asked Bobby.

134
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, because, like, you know, I trust Bobby to keep his mouth shut.

135
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:38,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, Bobby, did they contact you?

136
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:38,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, no.

137
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,098
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so I was like, okay.

138
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:45,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they reached out to like and I'm thinking like maybe like Gamer Tag Radio has been on a long time.

139
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,023
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the show?

140
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,204
[SPEAKER_09]: The Outsider, Video Game Outsider has been a long time.

141
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:51,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they reached out some of the other shows.

142
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:52,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

143
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, turns out in the book and I do want to address this.

144
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:04,092
[SPEAKER_09]: In the book, they actually acknowledge another podcast out of Spain called Game Over, and they actually give them the distinction of the longest running podcast.

145
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:11,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have the distinction of the longest running English language podcast, which when you consider that the book is English language, it's important.

146
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:19,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to choose my words carefully here because I do not want to mean any disrespect to these hardworking individuals at the Game Over podcast in Spain.

147
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I can't listen to it because I don't speak the language.

148
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:24,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't understand it.

149
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:26,942
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure they work very hard.

150
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I know very well.

151
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:29,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, DarkSakura, we all know very well.

152
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:33,326
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a heck of a lot of discipline to do this for a long time.

153
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:43,892
[SPEAKER_09]: That all being said, in the promotion we use for Orange Lounge Radio, in the descriptions on social media and things, we say longest running video game podcast.

154
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not going to change that.

155
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,033
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to tell you why.

156
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:51,136
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I got to be careful here because I don't mean this with any disrespect.

157
00:12:52,099 --> 00:13:02,443
[SPEAKER_09]: However, from what I have done the research on the Game Over podcast out of Spain, they kind of start and stop a little bit.

158
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:07,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a little bit hard to call yourself the longest running player.

159
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

160
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,771
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:44,844
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

162
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,831
[SPEAKER_09]: We are currently on episode number 1017.

163
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:16,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Now have we been able to be on every week?

164
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:16,874
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

165
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:25,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Things are going to happen and I'm not going to apologize for taking a winter vacation or when my mother passed away we were out for two weeks.

166
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I think these are all fairly reasonable things.

167
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:37,614
[SPEAKER_09]: But this other show, and again, respectful, oldest podcast maybe, but not longest running.

168
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:41,737
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're taking every summer off and you've taken an entire year off.

169
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:52,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is the logic that we are going to continue to use and why we will continue to brand ourselves the longest running podcast about video games until we are no longer on.

170
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:57,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Frodo Swaggins in chat says, video game outsiders claims to be the longest running also.

171
00:14:58,248 --> 00:14:58,348
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

172
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,230
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, again, I want to be respectful.

173
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,092
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to be on the same network with those guys.

174
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no hard feelings or anything.

175
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:06,715
[SPEAKER_09]: They are hardworking.

176
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:10,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Michelle was even a guest on a show about Warcraft I did once.

177
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine group of folks.

178
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,264
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that is what is being claimed, and I understand this is coming through a game of telephone.

179
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:21,148
[SPEAKER_09]: If they are saying they are one of the longest running, that's different.

180
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:21,949
[SPEAKER_09]: They can say that.

181
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:26,071
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it is the longest running, unfortunately, that is incorrect.

182
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:33,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've given you all the evidence you need as far as our claim to it.

183
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:36,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is, they know better.

184
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and so again, I'm going to hope, again, I want you to listen for this.

185
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:45,836
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're saying they are one of the longest running, that's fine.

186
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,477
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us have an issue with that.

187
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:50,479
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they say longest running, that should be corrected.

188
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope they will do that.

189
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, they should know because we were on the same network, All Games Radio, for quite some time.

190
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:57,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

191
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But nothing but the best.

192
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:00,775
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

193
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:07,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite frankly, if you are still going, like any of these shows I mentioned, there's a lot of other hard-working, long-running shows out there.

194
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:11,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to think we're celebrating with you.

195
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:17,589
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a lot of discipline to do this for one year, let alone over 20.

196
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody should be proud of what they've accomplished.

197
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,695
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is also, if it sounds like we're being dicks about this...

198
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:37,159
[SPEAKER_09]: that's why because we worked hard for this title we're going to hang on to it yes we are so hope you understand hope you understand um

199
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:38,916
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that.

200
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:41,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else, DarkSakura and Loki, you want to add about this?

201
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:45,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've been talking, but obviously you all share in this 100%.

202
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:52,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I did reach out through a couple of channels to see about getting our certificates.

203
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:56,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually submitted an application because we were awarded this without an application.

204
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:58,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

205
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:04,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to have everything above the table, as it were.

206
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:04,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

207
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:25,918
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I've put in an official application with under us as a group and with our names on there and copied and pasted verbatim thank you text copy from preview everything that was in the article page number publication date all of it like you guys wrote this about us I'm not making it up

208
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And if two of us, we've got stage names listed.

209
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and two of them are right.

210
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I should address, they put the wrong name for me in there.

211
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I know what they did.

212
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:42,499
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just going to say...

213
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not have been upset if they put Rob... Well, I'm not upset.

214
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:50,004
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just my luck and I just roll my eyes and have fun with it.

215
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:57,369
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it had said Rob Sky, S-K-I-E, Roberts, I would have been like, all right, yeah, I used that nickname for a very, very long time.

216
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:58,450
[SPEAKER_09]: That goes back to DDR Freak.

217
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I ain't mad about it.

218
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Where V comes from...

219
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna walk around with my mug I'm a winner baby

220
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:42,046
[SPEAKER_09]: But in serious, you know, you bring up a good point, DarkSakura, is that we had actually asked six years ago, five, no, it was when the 20th, you did it for the 20th.

221
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:50,189
[SPEAKER_09]: We sent them, you sent them a contact and they said basically pay us because they saw Orange Lounge Radio.

222
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,209
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, you're a business.

223
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:53,710
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to pay a thousand dollars to be considered.

224
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were like, we don't have that kind of money.

225
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:59,312
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they said I put in the wrong application and that I had to reapply.

226
00:18:59,532 --> 00:18:59,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.

227
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, but the application they wanted had the money, right?

228
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:07,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's if you wanted to push it through.

229
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well...

230
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:12,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a $5 application fee for just doing a standard 12-week application.

231
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:23,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless, we have this Gamers Edition probably to thank for the fact that it came back for this distinction.

232
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:33,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to the editors at the Guinness Gamers Edition for finding us and for giving us the distinction.

233
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super appreciated.

234
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,121
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

235
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:35,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

236
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:36,982
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

237
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you again to all of you that have supported us over the years.

238
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:42,485
[SPEAKER_09]: You all share in this too.

239
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,147
[SPEAKER_09]: You all have been a part of this.

240
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:50,292
[SPEAKER_09]: You all get to say you have been part of what is now a Guinness World Record holding podcast.

241
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:50,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's your fault.

242
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's pretty fucking phenomenal.

243
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,497
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

244
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:56,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, anything you want to add?

245
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:03,304
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just think it's really exciting to finally be acknowledged, you know, without having to, you know,

246
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:04,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, maybe.

247
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:29,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, it's in going back to what somebody else had brought up a moment ago and chat about potentially other shows claiming they're the longest running because they just they don't know about us.

248
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:35,923
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it is it is nice to see that Guinness did the homework to figure it out.

249
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's that's very kind.

250
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:39,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And that does.

251
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:42,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that does feel nice because, you know,

252
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:50,476
[SPEAKER_09]: We aren't listened to by hundreds of thousands of people every week or even tens of thousands or barely a thousand every week.

253
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:57,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nice that, you know, to be found in our little corner of the internet, our little fam that we have here on Sunday night.

254
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:01,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, I really appreciate them for doing the homework and finding us.

255
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Super appreciate it.

256
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do.

257
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:05,909
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

258
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:06,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

259
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:12,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with that, we can stop talking about ourselves and get back into talking about some video games and gaming news.

260
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:17,596
[SPEAKER_09]: And well, actually, let me just quickly mention some comments in chat, of course, over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

261
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,758
[SPEAKER_09]: S2 and Hunter Matt says, congrats.

262
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:21,859
[SPEAKER_09]: We from the OL Army are proud of you.

263
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,501
[SPEAKER_09]: We would be here if you guys didn't bring the awesome and bring us joy every week.

264
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:25,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, 100%.

265
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:29,344
[SPEAKER_09]: ZenMonkey11 says, no shame in being proud of your work.

266
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:30,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for understanding that.

267
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:31,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, again...

268
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:32,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

269
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:55,518
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, now if there is ever a Wikipedia entry page, they can't take it down now.

270
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you bring up an excellent point.

271
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:08,061
[SPEAKER_09]: The old Wikipedia page was pulled because there was no, all the sourcing in it was from like our own pages.

272
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:12,242
[SPEAKER_09]: You now have a source from Guinness World Record Gamers Edition 2025.

273
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:13,122
[SPEAKER_09]: What page number, Loki?

274
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:44,457
[SPEAKER_09]: 62 62 that says we're the longest running English language podcast about video games so now you can source something like that's a pretty respectable source I don't know copy and paste that I put in our application I'm putting it in chat I don't know how to make a Wikipedia page and as I understand that would be outside the ethical guidelines anyway since I'm involved with this show but maybe those of you that know a little more about it

275
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:50,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Go forth and have fun and I would love that if it works.

276
00:22:52,423 --> 00:23:02,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, Bobby Blackwell pointing out, I'm on episode 907 starting in July 2005, you know, kind of pointing out that he's been running just as long as some of these other shows that are longest running.

277
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:13,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bobby, obviously, a huge part of why we're still on the air to this day, saving us from Life 365 and getting us our former All Games Radio partnership.

278
00:23:13,863 --> 00:23:15,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate that as well.

279
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:16,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

280
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:18,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, thank you for Bobby.

281
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:38,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have to, at some point, also say a huge thank you to VXJasonXV because even though his face is not on the wall right now, he was with this show for a very long time in person, but every week without fail, he's putting in the work of doing the intro, doing those bumps, some of the web stuff behind the scene.

282
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:39,866
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jason,

283
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:42,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely shares in this with us as well.

284
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jason's in chat.

285
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:43,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're welcome.

286
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,170
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

287
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,171
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I didn't even know you were here.

288
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:50,097
[SPEAKER_09]: But Jason shares with us in that 100% as well and needs to be called out.

289
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,840
[SPEAKER_09]: So put that on Wikipedia.

290
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,922
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get into... Okay, enough talk about ourselves, I promise.

291
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:02,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into talking about some video game news.

292
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:05,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, pretty big one dropped this week.

293
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:06,408
[SPEAKER_09]: New console, am I right?

294
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:10,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we kind of knew it was coming because of all the leaks and everything.

295
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:14,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So the PlayStation 5 Pro has been officially announced.

296
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:19,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to a presentation by Mark Cerny.

297
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:29,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Having you compare the two images sent by corporate that are identical because, you know, they look very close in quality.

298
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:33,039
[SPEAKER_02]: No, to be fair, the PlayStation 5 Pro does have better graphics.

299
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Very small details, but that's been kind of one of the sticking points with it.

300
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:58,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a 67% larger GPU, 28% faster RAM, and renders at 45% faster, as well as improved ray tracing speeds and AI upscaling that they call PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.

301
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's $700.

302
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:00,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

303
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:29,974
[SPEAKER_02]: $700 for a digital version $699 US dollars $699 US dollars and that is of course if you want your physical collection to be able to play on it you're going to have to pay $80 to get one of those drives that is if you can get one of the disc drives for it because scalpers are a thing and they have bought the drives so that nobody else can have them um

304
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:39,363
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course, you know, $700 or in this case $800 because also the vertical stand's not included as well in case you want it not to tip over easily.

305
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:50,049
[SPEAKER_02]: The argument is I guess that it's a console that you could sell your old one and then trade it in and it's only $350 then, right?

306
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,950
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not so bad, right?

307
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:59,094
[SPEAKER_09]: That's if it's in good condition and you get all the money and all that good stuff, but yes.

308
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:05,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I personally will not be jumping to get one of these because I don't see the point, and it's expensive.

309
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:06,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

310
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:09,439
[SPEAKER_02]: They also raised the controller prices too, I believe, recently.

311
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,080
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that as well.

312
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:14,583
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole bunch of price gouging.

313
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:24,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think this is going to go over about as well as the original announcement of the PlayStation 3 when Sony really took it on the chin.

314
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:32,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, granted, there's a huge difference here, and that is that Microsoft came out the very next day and basically was like, our system's going to be $100 cheaper.

315
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it was the other way around.

316
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:34,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember.

317
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:35,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a long time ago, but...

318
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:37,134
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

319
00:26:51,331 --> 00:27:10,665
[SPEAKER_09]: but if there's there's a lot that's different now and even looking at the PlayStation 4 Pro because I posted my own distaste about you know this and the fact that I really think this is too expensive and I had a rando reply to me on Blue Sky basically saying I don't see the difference between this and what they did with the PS4 Pro and I'm like

320
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:28,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Pro or Sib, like this is actually a huge difference because when the PlayStation 4 Pro came out, it was the exact same price that the PlayStation 4 was originally introduced at, which I believe was $399, $499 at the time.

321
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:34,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, my memory is vague, but I know it was the exact same price as the PlayStation 4 when it first came out.

322
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:36,430
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

323
00:27:52,282 --> 00:27:57,204
[SPEAKER_09]: You might start looking at, can I get a gaming PC or a gaming rig?

324
00:27:57,704 --> 00:28:02,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of Sony's exclusive games are also on PC at this point.

325
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:06,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they're still committed to putting out stuff on PC as well.

326
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:20,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on top of that, going back to the PlayStation 4 Pro... Well, I just want to quickly say before somebody corrects me, I understand a super-duper graphics card is going to be very expensive, but still, I think perception...

327
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:24,436
[SPEAKER_09]: is always going to be more important than the truth in this industry.

328
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,778
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a hard fact, hard pill to swallow.

329
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:30,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And the perception of the $700 price tag right now is it doesn't buy you much.

330
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:31,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Loki.

331
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:54,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was gonna say like the the jump from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 4 Pro was a bit more significant like especially when we're talking like VR and stuff they would really enhance you know what can be done with PlayStation VR like the resolution was much higher there was a lot of other nice features to go along with that you know smoother gameplay and stuff

332
00:28:54,713 --> 00:29:02,495
[SPEAKER_02]: What they showed, like the comparison screenshots that they showed or gameplay videos, they had to zoom way in on the background.

333
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, see this thing way in the distance over there?

334
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's slightly more sharp now.

335
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not night and day different.

336
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:12,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It really isn't.

337
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:22,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe there'll be more games that support that later on, or maybe they'll just have specific games that only play on the PlayStation 5 Pro, but...

338
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really making the argument as well.

339
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recall, and I could be wrong, and if somebody wants to fact check me in real time, fine.

340
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:35,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recall there ever being a PlayStation 4 Pro only game.

341
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:44,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some people are thinking about new 3DS, and that was a thing, but that was a very different can of worms.

342
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:48,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe there was ever a game that would only run on PlayStation 4 Pro.

343
00:29:49,707 --> 00:30:04,796
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think Sony had said that is that they kind of mandated it had to run on the base PS4 even if crappy which I think is what happened with Cyberpunk so yeah I mean like it's

344
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,957
[SPEAKER_02]: They certainly had, like... I just think the performance was better.

345
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:21,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the jump in performance with games was much more significant because we were talking... It was... I mean, there was still 4K gaming, I think, but it wasn't as, like... It was a little bit more...

346
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:50,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Noticeable, like you had games go from 30 to 60 FPS and you had, you know, a lot more detail in there and some of these more performance modes and stuff but just with this, just from what they even showed, like the argument that they're trying to make on some of these older games, it's like, yeah it looks slightly better, but like it's not that much better, it's not like we're talking, going from something looking very basic to just like holy cow, this is retrace the hell and

347
00:30:51,016 --> 00:31:19,486
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just the most amazing looking graphics I've ever seen it's not that at all it could be something later on in the future that you may have more of these enhancements and stuff and it's also something where they have that performance mode and they have the high fidelity mode and now with the Pro you get the best of both worlds with that but it just hasn't sold me on it it's very expensive and the performance upgrade

348
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:22,907
[SPEAKER_02]: What they demonstrated was not enough.

349
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this item, you know, I'm not saying there's not a place for it.

350
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it will end up being very much a boutique kind of item.

351
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this thing ends up being a high collectible value.

352
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:40,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this really does become a collector's item.

353
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:49,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in a few years, people who had a PS5 Pro, it's going to be like, ooh, that was kind of like the niche one that ran things a little better.

354
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:49,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, interesting.

355
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:51,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when we kind of look back,

356
00:31:51,975 --> 00:32:10,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the collectability of this thing is going to be pretty good I don't think that sells a lot of units at the end of the day and I'm just trying to be fair like some of you might be rolling your eyes at what I'm saying but I think realistically with the high price tag it becomes like a high-end car it's like oh okay fancy but you can't drive it but my Prius gets better gas mileage

357
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,781
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:38,845
[SPEAKER_09]: who actually said, now if Nintendo wants to put Switch 2 out for $399, that would be closer to the realm of possibility.

359
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:47,792
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and a moment ago I mentioned one big difference between this and the PlayStation 3 price tag I compared this to is that you don't have Microsoft coming out the next day.

360
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:53,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't see Microsoft kind of changing their Series X and Series S type of thing.

361
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:54,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Series X is not a PS5 Pro.

362
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:56,399
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a PS5.

363
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Series S is actually under...

364
00:32:59,341 --> 00:32:59,902
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:35,393
[SPEAKER_09]: and do that first unveiling of the Switch 2, which to be fair, would be in line with how the Switch was unveiled.

366
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:45,101
[SPEAKER_09]: There was like a two minute commercial that came out in like October the year before that basically showed the Switch concept.

367
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:47,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the people playing on the rooftop and all that shit?

368
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was like January.

369
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:51,107
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was the year before.

370
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:55,888
[SPEAKER_09]: that they showed it very quickly and then January was the deep dive.

371
00:33:56,388 --> 00:34:05,589
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the full press announcement with all the pomp and circumstance, the full launch lineup, the date, the price, all that stuff.

372
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:19,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's very possible Nintendo in the next couple weeks comes out and shows an early concept and I think that still could take the thunder from this thing a little bit.

373
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:26,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure there's a lot of oomph behind this anyway.

374
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think your...

375
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:56,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost want to say well-to-do or at least people with a high gaming budget let's say people with a high gaming budget friends that want this as a collectability that's going to be who gets this and I don't really think a Switch 2 announcement cuts into that too much but it could be very interesting I think from a talk of the town type of thing I think once that Switch 2 commercial hits nobody's talking about PS5 Pro anymore nobody

376
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

377
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:00,893
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

378
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:06,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby is remembering a time when Loki said that commercial showed hardware that was not possible.

379
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:08,855
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember saying that.

380
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:15,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby says, to be fair, I also thought it was exaggerating how quickly it would go from handheld to docked.

381
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all kind of thought that at the beginning.

382
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:19,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they're souping this up for the commercial.

383
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:21,718
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to switch over that fast.

384
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, well, shit, it did.

385
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:24,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

386
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,380
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fucking fast, actually.

387
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,504
[SPEAKER_09]: So it will be interesting to see what happens when and if the Switch 2 is unveiled.

388
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:37,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the PlayStation 5 Pro, props to you if you can afford one.

389
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:38,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to hate on it.

390
00:35:38,728 --> 00:35:41,470
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have a nice little collector's item, I think, if you can afford one.

391
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Me, I'm going to pass.

392
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:45,592
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

393
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:47,594
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's it on the PS5 Pro,

394
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:54,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

395
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:55,616
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

396
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:56,296
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week?

397
00:35:58,077 --> 00:35:58,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of annoying.

398
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:01,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play some Dead by Daylight.

399
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:02,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played the new mode yet.

400
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do that tonight after the show.

401
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:36,441
[SPEAKER_03]: but I tried to start the casting of Frank Stone and my game would just go black and not let me past anything every time I had to do this one part where you deck the titular character in the face that's without spoiling much about the game so I went to log back in today to see if I could check up on that and when I hit continue it darted me over from the beginning

402
00:36:38,069 --> 00:37:06,794
[SPEAKER_03]: so needless to say I'm a little bit frustrated by that that's annoying and don't forget people playing DBD if you put in blood pint one word in the store you will redeem 500,000 blood points and of course for those of us who got the pre-order bonuses though for that game that was 2 million blood points they gave out it was pretty epic um

403
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:31,384
[SPEAKER_03]: and then um I played Simpalia and that's really about it just because I had so much going on um because we had Fuck It Friday um which was of course at my house and we decided to be terrible human beings and break out the bigger blacker box and uh

404
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:50,568
[SPEAKER_03]: the things we found super objectionable we just like put them somewhere else and backed them away and said we weren't touching them and I did something else oh yeah I saw Beetlejuice Beetlejuice last night was that a good time?

405
00:37:52,481 --> 00:38:16,736
[SPEAKER_03]: um yeah it was really good it was quite the worthy sequel but I wanted the they had like these like promotional uh lowball glasses as they called them but they ran out so I just basically drank um not just one espresso margarita not margarita but espresso martini but he said drink some down there's some left in the container

406
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: and I just saw him pour Grey Goose for a while and I'm like, oh lord I'm either gonna pass out or have to pee or just be really hyper the latter two happened the movie was really good, I very much enjoyed it there's nothing after the credits it was very worthy and I'm pretty sure the door is open for a tertiary entry into it

407
00:38:49,728 --> 00:39:01,195
[SPEAKER_03]: but I really enjoyed it that ending was well paced and very good I thought that they did it just right so

408
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It also reminds me just how weird the lyrics of MacArthur Park are.

409
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:20,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went back, though, and was just playing Jackie Crush and Devil's Crush and just a few little teeny things on my own.

410
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:21,577
[SPEAKER_03]: But I...

411
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been low on bandwidth all week with getting ready for TwitchCon, so yeah.

412
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

413
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:36,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And PodCulture, I normally do not play Cards Against Humanity because of practices within the company.

414
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:43,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I no longer give them any business, but I already had the box, so it is what it is.

415
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on to Loki.

416
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

417
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:50,833
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was mostly Minecraft.

418
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally, I've been playing some of the Discord games.

419
00:39:57,217 --> 00:40:11,046
[SPEAKER_02]: My co-hosts, or not co-hosts, are one of the fellow cast members to have me try this Zynga game called Farmerge Valley that's just a brain-dead gacha game.

420
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:11,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

421
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:14,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pretty brain-dead, but...

422
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

423
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another ferret.

424
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:46,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you found one of those old ass fair.

425
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:47,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

426
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:50,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to perform surgery to get the batteries replaced.

427
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:50,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

428
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:51,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

429
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the world record thing, we may have some new listeners this week.

430
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:59,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So we used to have this mascot, this little stuffed fair.

431
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hold it up for the camera, Loki?

432
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So at least the live listeners.

433
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:03,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually in the book.

434
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:05,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

435
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:08,583
[SPEAKER_09]: They took that part of the clip art, didn't they?

436
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:09,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

437
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's all pixel art that I made.

438
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:13,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

439
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:24,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So we used to have this little stuffed ferret, called a scoozie, that would make these dumb little noises that Jamie used to love and cling to during the old episodes of OLR.

440
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:27,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And the ferret was kind of like the mascot of OLR, which is why...

441
00:41:28,396 --> 00:41:28,836
[SPEAKER_09]: They did, yeah.

442
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:01,066
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's annoying they have like battery boxes inside of them but there's no way to open them up so I had to kind of perform surgery to get the batteries replaced.

443
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,127
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTutsu asked, does it make the noise?

444
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like it does but it's just not coming through your mic right now.

445
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:05,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

446
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make noise.

447
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:12,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to like see if I can pick it up if I'm talking while doing it.

448
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:17,059
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds all robot-y like audio compression or something.

449
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's outside noise.

450
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta suppress it.

451
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:22,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it

452
00:42:23,946 --> 00:42:48,420
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it'll keep filtering it out unfortunately all right well that's that's awesome all right any anything else for your gaming week uh no that's just it um yeah like I said I've got well TwitchCon this week so there's lots of Minecraft related things I'll be doing uh this week and networking and stuff so that'll be fun um I just put up put an episode out today so yeah nice

453
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:51,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And happy belated birthday.

454
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:52,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Your birthday was this past week.

455
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:56,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we all gave you shouts on social media and in the Discord and all that.

456
00:42:56,459 --> 00:43:01,502
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, the best birthday present you could give Loki is get someone to subscribe to his YouTube channel.

457
00:43:01,522 --> 00:43:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch time.

458
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:03,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch time would be nice.

459
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:06,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my watch time, it's year to year and it keeps going down.

460
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:07,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

461
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:09,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like a few thousand followers.

462
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,370
[SPEAKER_02]: The episodes just don't get watched.

463
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:23,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's a bunch of bots that sub to my channel or something, but it's... Well, if you want to get Loki a present, then have one of his videos on in the background while you cook dinner.

464
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:27,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you should watch it, but short of that, have it on while you cook dinner.

465
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:33,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say watch it illegally or bought it, but just watch it while you're multitasking.

466
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:33,980
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

467
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,421
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it on loop.

468
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did a thing.

469
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:42,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you buy one of these things off eBay or something?

470
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,474
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one on Macari for $11.

471
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:47,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's not so bad.

472
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:48,175
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not so bad.

473
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:48,875
[SPEAKER_01]: $11 is good.

474
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:52,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this was only like, it was less than $10, I think.

475
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:54,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

476
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:57,439
[SPEAKER_03]: They had one of the original, like, bigger ones for like $30.

477
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:01,485
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

478
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:38,702
[SPEAKER_02]: um but I think even those I think those had like battery box like velcro battery boxes and stuff that you could do like this is sewn in which is annoying because I had to cut it open to get to the the box to replace the watch batteries in there that were super old um but yeah

479
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:51,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of the OLR old throwback days, since we're really reminiscing this week, do you know who I kind of actually... So I posted the world record thing on Facebook, and I got to say, I was not expecting the response I got.

480
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:55,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I think more people liked the world record thing on my Facebook than liked the post when I got married.

481
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:59,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is what it is.

482
00:44:59,645 --> 00:45:00,565
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the algorithm.

483
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Either it's going to get you or it's not.

484
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:29,906
[SPEAKER_09]: and one of the people who reached out out of the blue who I hadn't heard from in quite some time was Darkchild who I don't know if you remember but him and Janae I can't remember if Janae used a stage name or not so sorry if I'm I'm doxing her but Janae and Darkchild were in the studio when Matt and I lived together so this would have been like the really early seasons of OLR when it was you know live probably pre-podcast time actually and

485
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:34,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Darkchild reached out to me and was like, hey, I heard about the world record.

486
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:35,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

487
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:36,711
[SPEAKER_09]: We should catch up.

488
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:37,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been forever.

489
00:45:37,872 --> 00:45:42,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I just realized if it wasn't for OLR, Janae and I would have never met.

490
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you all know him and Janae are married now and have a kid.

491
00:45:46,238 --> 00:46:13,448
[SPEAKER_09]: and they met because of OLR and being in the studio together all those years ago so that was really cool to hear from him out of the blue so shout out if you're out there Dark Child and Janae of course so miss I um unfortunately you don't really do the in-person thing anymore but I would I would love to even just have you on over discord just to just to catch up all these years later that would be such a fun I don't know if it would be a good Sunday night show but maybe like a spin-off thing at VOG Network like reach out to some of these people

492
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:15,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't heard from him forever.

493
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:16,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Like those two.

494
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:19,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Puppy comes to mind.

495
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:20,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he's still around.

496
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:24,120
[SPEAKER_09]: You know he does like Star Wars lightsaber battle shit that's like really intense.

497
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It really looks cool.

498
00:46:25,401 --> 00:46:26,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I follow him on Instagram.

499
00:46:26,923 --> 00:46:27,564
[SPEAKER_09]: He's still around.

500
00:46:27,964 --> 00:46:29,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Who else from back in those days?

501
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Princess Irene.

502
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I could get a hold of her pretty easy.

503
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:32,830
[SPEAKER_09]: She's still around.

504
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:38,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people, unfortunately, I don't talk to anymore, such as Life.

505
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't promise everybody from back in the day.

506
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:44,336
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Mels, the Mels would always be happy to pop on and say hello.

507
00:46:44,476 --> 00:46:47,077
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it might be fun to come back.

508
00:46:47,117 --> 00:46:48,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, DDR Angel.

509
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:49,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

510
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:52,380
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel is now Tech Angel and she streams.

511
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's very easy to find.

512
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:55,041
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

513
00:46:56,886 --> 00:46:58,408
[SPEAKER_09]: VAMPIRE SURVIVORS

514
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:21,268
[SPEAKER_09]: because it's only five bucks and hey, I can grind for trophies and I really love Vampire Survivors.

515
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:28,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a great, fun, mindless game that, you know, suddenly, oops, it's two hours later.

516
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,050
[SPEAKER_09]: What have I been doing?

517
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing Vampire Survivors.

518
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was really fun to get.

519
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:35,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I also picked up a game just based on word of mouth.

520
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a pretty reasonable price and people seemed to really like this game.

521
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:40,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was really curious, like, would I be into this game?

522
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:41,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So I bought a game.

523
00:47:41,173 --> 00:47:43,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'm going to pronounce this right, but it's called Bellatro.

524
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:44,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I think

525
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:45,374
[SPEAKER_09]: is the name of the game.

526
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that card game.

527
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:47,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you got it.

528
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:54,098
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the card game that sort of has they call roguelike elements into it because there's some deck building type of mechanics that are in it.

529
00:47:55,299 --> 00:48:10,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically the whole concept is around these different jokers that do these different effects on how you total your hand at the end because the whole like totaling of the hand feels very similar to like cribbage, which is an old game I really like.

530
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:11,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of interesting.

531
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:12,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it in forever.

532
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:13,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

533
00:48:13,587 --> 00:48:39,057
[SPEAKER_09]: so I think Bellatro is interesting I'm not sure it's grabbing me as much as I thought it would because let's be real this is a game they could have done on like Windows 3.1 like this is more of a reflection of like the popularity of roguelikes and casual games and those sorts of things there's nothing about this game why it needs to be on PS5 and PC which is fine a good game is a good game

534
00:48:39,557 --> 00:48:44,519
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I was kind of really expecting to be like drawn in and sucked in by the gameplay.

535
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to admit, I'm kind of not.

536
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see where it's addicting for some people.

537
00:48:49,741 --> 00:48:52,182
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not sure it's addicting for me, to be quite honest.

538
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:53,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's okay.

539
00:48:53,783 --> 00:48:54,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't mean it's a bad game.

540
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:57,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think like I played it for a little bit.

541
00:48:57,364 --> 00:49:01,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I'm not sure I understand the strategy here.

542
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:04,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the tutorial really just cuts off at some point.

543
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:06,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, I'm not sure what I should be doing.

544
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:08,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I keep winning these hands.

545
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:33,885
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm not sure I understand all of these mechanics and some might say that's part of the experience is learning all that shit but I don't know I feel like I needed just a little more like move me in the right direction so I really understand if I'm playing this game well or what I need to be doing better that was the only thing that kind of got me about it but otherwise I mean it's pretty cheap so it's pretty hard to go wrong at the price it's at

546
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:36,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other game I played this week.

547
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:42,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So happy anniversary to the Dreamcast, which turned 25 this last week.

548
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:44,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we mentioned at the end of last week's show.

549
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:53,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was able to... I went to one of my friends on Monday who got out the Dreamcast and we fucking played Power Stone.

550
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:54,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And boy...

551
00:49:55,845 --> 00:49:57,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, am I bad at Power Stone.

552
00:49:57,906 --> 00:49:59,547
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not bad at Crazy Taxi.

553
00:49:59,607 --> 00:50:01,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually played that for a little bit, and that was fun.

554
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:06,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on Friday, I went out to the local Daddy Bar.

555
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I call it the Daddy Bar.

556
00:50:08,393 --> 00:50:08,893
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Bolt.

557
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:09,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you know that place.

558
00:50:10,394 --> 00:50:14,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So I went out to the Bolt because they have Gamer Night with a Y. G-A-Y-M-E-R Night.

559
00:50:15,197 --> 00:50:16,018
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend rents that.

560
00:50:16,698 --> 00:50:19,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, every second Friday is when that is.

561
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:21,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I know your friend?

562
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:21,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably do.

563
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:22,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Unite

564
00:50:41,098 --> 00:50:55,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my fucking ass destroyed and get your mind out of the gutter because we're not talking about the bolt in this sentence I'm talking about Marvel vs. Capcom 2 I got destroyed they do have that swing in there you know

565
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:58,689
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not talking about that.

566
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:03,650
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about good old-fashioned video games, which I was terrible at.

567
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not realize how bad I was.

568
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:07,811
[SPEAKER_09]: We did play, though.

569
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get taken for a ride?

570
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:12,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, out on the patio.

571
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:12,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

572
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:17,454
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I did not leave it at home, but no, I got wrecked.

573
00:51:18,735 --> 00:51:21,796
[SPEAKER_09]: But earlier in the week, again on Dreamcast night, I played...

574
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:47,058
[SPEAKER_09]: it wasn't Dreamcast but there was also just Steam Deck going around so I played SNK versus Capcom because they just released that not that long ago on Steam and so and my friend was like oh you actually are pretty you're pretty decent at this one because I'm bad a lot but that one has Mai and I love Mai and when I started playing as Mai I was actually winning and he was like oh you're you're pretty decent at this one I was like yes because I can play as Mai

575
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:50,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So, alright.

576
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:51,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that was my gaming week.

577
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:53,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope y'all are proud of me.

578
00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:55,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I played quite a few games besides just Final Fantasy XIV.

579
00:51:55,876 --> 00:52:02,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news and some things that are going on in the gaming world, which there's a lot to talk about again this week.

580
00:52:03,158 --> 00:52:04,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's gonna start us off.

581
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:04,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

582
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Flappy Bird!

583
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:09,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're talking about Flappy Bird.

584
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2013 all over again.

585
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,880
[SPEAKER_02]: What year is it?

586
00:52:14,161 --> 00:52:17,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Flappy Bird is coming back to mobile storefronts and web browsers.

587
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:20,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out next year.

588
00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:49,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, are you saying Don Nguyen's finally getting his coin all these years later off this?

589
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:51,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess we should be happy for it, shouldn't we?

590
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,920
[SPEAKER_02]: and then what else did they also probably get in there?

591
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did we say NFTs?

592
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:23,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what makes all good games nowadays is if it has NFTs in it and that's what they're doing is they're bringing NFTs into Flappy Bird.

593
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:46,329
[SPEAKER_02]: needless flappy tokens I do like how they're being the company is being harassed on social media by some journalists which I thought was funny they keep asking them questions about it so everything I'm saying about Don Nguyen the original creator is very tongue-in-cheek because y'all know what happened here right

594
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:55,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, trademark law has a thing where if you don't use something for so long, you have effectively abandoned it.

595
00:53:55,504 --> 00:54:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence, why Nintendo always fights all of their IPs, even when they frustratingly are not making new games in them.

596
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:04,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero.

597
00:54:06,294 --> 00:54:28,209
[SPEAKER_09]: but that's why they'll put an F-Zero download content thing into Mario Kart because that renews the timer on their trademark so that nobody else can just swoop in and get that trademark and Don Nguyen has actually come out and said no I have no relation with their game I did not sell anything also I don't support crypto um

598
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:34,148
[SPEAKER_02]: He never re-upped the trademark, which led to it being acquired by another company.

599
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,529
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is tied to Web3, likely has microtransactions.

600
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:43,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, fuck all of this.

601
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:47,816
[SPEAKER_09]: is basically... Maybe that's opinion, but fine.

602
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:49,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck all of this.

603
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:56,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they literally stole... I mean, yeah, it's legal, but let's be real.

604
00:54:57,248 --> 00:54:59,651
[SPEAKER_09]: So much with trademark and copyright.

605
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:01,273
[SPEAKER_09]: These laws in this country...

606
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:15,764
[SPEAKER_09]: were built long before the internet and goddamn do they need some modernization because another excellent example of where trademark laws are doing people fucking dirty is with, I'm sure you all know Jules from TikTok.

607
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:22,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you don't watch TikTok, you've probably heard the phrase, very demure, very mindful, very cutesy.

608
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:26,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was a trans woman of color that started that trend.

609
00:55:26,452 --> 00:55:27,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what?

610
00:55:27,232 --> 00:55:30,795
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as that whole very demure, very mindful caught on,

611
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:40,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other little troll, trademarked, very demure, very mindful, so that they could put it on a t-shirt and make all the money.

612
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:54,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I believe, thankfully, some pro bono folks are helping Jules out, and I think she... I haven't caught the latest on the drama, but I think last I heard, quotey, it's all been worked out, which means...

613
00:55:55,219 --> 00:56:23,125
[SPEAKER_09]: they sent hefty letters to these individuals that were trademarking basically saying we're going to sue the fuck out of you if you don't let this go and so they let it go and I don't know if you heard but however you feel about that phrase and however you feel about that trend she is getting the surgeries that she wanted paid for thanks to the TikTok revenue so hey I would much rather she be making some coin

614
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:29,990
[SPEAKER_09]: and some of the people that are making coin on another popular social media site but I'm not going to go there because I promise to be nice today.

615
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:31,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

616
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:33,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Patrick Klepek.

617
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:36,295
[SPEAKER_02]: They just sing so great.

618
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:44,102
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep responding to all the posts by the Flappy Bird account saying, I'm ready for the answer to what your relationship is with the original creator of this game.

619
00:56:44,562 --> 00:56:45,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Who made this game?

620
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:47,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd you get the IP?

621
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:49,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't you answering any questions?

622
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:50,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

623
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:54,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

624
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:55,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

625
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:59,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, hope you flop.

626
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope it's floppy bird, quite honestly.

627
00:57:01,394 --> 00:57:04,056
[SPEAKER_09]: So that will be the last we'll be talking about this game on this show.

628
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,778
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is a tough lesson learned.

629
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:12,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So let this be a warning to all of you if you're going to start making games, Loki.

630
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:26,670
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to still make money off those games 10 years later, if your game goes viral, so I'm sorry, Loki, maybe you don't need to worry about this, but if your game goes viral and somebody else wants to make coin off of it, you better renew them trademarks.

631
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:34,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And boy, do we need some people in the trademark, patent, copyright offices, legal stuff in this country.

632
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:39,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, we need some people at the helm that understand the internet and how the internet has changed the entire fucking game.

633
00:57:40,492 --> 00:58:04,063
[SPEAKER_09]: so because we need some modernization in these laws if Mickey Mouse can stay untouched for 95 years can't can't this world be free of Flappy Bird for another 95 years 85 whatever anyway go buy Don Nguyen a coffee Bobby's saying it's because he stopped selling on the store which makes sense

634
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:09,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, he pulled, yeah, I mean, it's, what, here's the thing.

635
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:14,251
[SPEAKER_09]: What these guys, these NFT companies, what they're doing is not illegal.

636
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,512
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, some would say it's smart.

637
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:26,975
[SPEAKER_09]: But we can all look at this and look under the layer of how they got to where they're at and where that money is actually going.

638
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:34,217
[SPEAKER_09]: We can say, you can look at it and go, it was a well-played capitalist move, but you can look at that and go, and it's fucking shitty.

639
00:58:35,014 --> 00:58:41,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's immoral, so I mean, yeah, it's legal, but you're... Who cares about morals when there's money to be made?

640
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:46,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, you know, it's just like the quote, it's like, you know, you're not wrong, you're just an asshole.

641
00:58:46,837 --> 00:58:48,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to what we said at the top of the show.

642
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:52,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the facts that matter, it's perception.

643
00:58:52,939 --> 00:58:58,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of this shit that's coming out about how Flappy Bird is getting rebooted, not a good perception.

644
00:59:00,723 --> 00:59:02,724
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

645
00:59:22,222 --> 00:59:23,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, look at this, look at this, look at this.

646
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:29,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Flappy Bird, still in my library with the little icon to download it.

647
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it wouldn't do shit.

648
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:34,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it's not going to run on this phone because of the whole Apple changed those rules a few years ago.

649
00:59:34,793 --> 00:59:38,717
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least I can say that's my little piece of gaming history.

650
00:59:39,697 --> 00:59:40,078
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

651
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:46,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby is also saying, I bet this new company will absolutely go after people who made Flappy Bird clones.

652
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:47,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes, they will.

653
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes, they will.

654
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:58,813
[SPEAKER_09]: If you made a Flappy Bird clone, you better delist that shit fast or you better call it Flappy Pow World because apparently that makes you invulnerable to these types of lawsuits.

655
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you know you just have to add guns to things and everything is legal?

656
01:00:02,594 --> 01:00:04,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Give the bird a gun and you'll be fine.

657
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:07,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen that game?

658
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:14,611
[SPEAKER_02]: The new one that's kind of along the lines of Palworld.

659
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:16,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Long Winter.

660
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:19,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically Animal Crossing.

661
01:00:19,893 --> 01:00:21,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the same company?

662
01:00:23,172 --> 01:00:32,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same company, but it's another company that took... I mean, you look at the article... But this is two years ago.

663
01:00:32,097 --> 01:00:33,278
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't exactly new.

664
01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:33,838
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

665
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not new, but like... I'm reacting live to this on Eris.

666
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing the video for folks on our... Oops, I gotta show the right screen, don't I?

667
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:43,884
[SPEAKER_09]: On our other screen here.

668
01:00:43,984 --> 01:00:45,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's fast forward to this here.

669
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:46,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

670
01:00:47,566 --> 01:00:50,688
[SPEAKER_09]: That character, like, isn't even legally distinct.

671
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:50,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

672
01:00:51,708 --> 01:01:08,645
[SPEAKER_09]: like that that is a fucking Animal Crossing character I'm sorry that we're seeing here on the screen let me uh let me fast forward a little further into what's going on here I mean I mean the game itself looks different yeah the game does look different like certainly not as good

673
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

674
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:12,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

675
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:13,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Nintendo.

676
01:01:13,868 --> 01:01:16,029
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell me, so they have guns?

677
01:01:16,529 --> 01:01:17,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they fracking?

678
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:18,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the fracking?

679
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a survival game and you have guns as well.

680
01:01:22,032 --> 01:01:24,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it looks like with all these rigs and things, this is fracking.

681
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:25,713
[SPEAKER_09]: It's animal fracking.

682
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:27,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal fracking?

683
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:30,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Nook strikes again.

684
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:35,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

685
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:38,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, even the interface, you look at the interface and the interface looks the same too.

686
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:39,420
Yeah.

687
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:41,912
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on.

688
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:45,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I don't have good news to follow this up with.

689
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:47,614
[SPEAKER_09]: We go from one shitty thing to another.

690
01:01:48,214 --> 01:01:52,376
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, on this story, we're going to be talking about layoffs.

691
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, Microsoft has conducted more layoffs this week.

692
01:01:56,558 --> 01:01:57,738
[SPEAKER_09]: They laid off 650 people this week.

693
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,320
[SPEAKER_09]: from the Xbox Gaming Division.

694
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:16,272
[SPEAKER_09]: This was announced in a company-wide memo that Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer sent and is also stressed as a part of this, no new games were being canceled or studios closed as a result of the latest round of cuts.

695
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:21,697
[SPEAKER_03]: This... Meaning people are going to be overworked and understaffed.

696
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:23,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

697
01:02:24,155 --> 01:02:28,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I have tried so hard over the years to really stick up for Phil Spencer.

698
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:31,280
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making it really fucking hard this year, Phil.

699
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever since this Activision acquisition.

700
01:02:34,423 --> 01:02:40,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, hey, I will say, you got Bobby Kotech out of the industry.

701
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,769
[SPEAKER_09]: That's his new name, Bobby Kotech.

702
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:44,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You got him out of the industry.

703
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Congrats.

704
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:53,039
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount of money that he was given as a golden parachute probably could have paid the salaries for these people for another four years.

705
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo his tomato.

706
01:02:55,682 --> 01:02:55,923
[SPEAKER_09]: That...

707
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:59,080
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

708
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,753
[SPEAKER_09]: how am I supposed to celebrate that?

709
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:30,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't

710
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I could read the rest of the comment here.

711
01:03:38,206 --> 01:03:48,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess in the interest of lighting up all sides, I guess I could say that Phil Spencer said the 650 rolls cut were, quote, mostly corporate and supporting functions.

712
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:58,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.

713
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:04,819
[SPEAKER_09]: No games, devices, or experiences are being canceled and new studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.

714
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,848
[SPEAKER_09]: which as we know was different from when there was 1,900 layoffs.

715
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:14,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this one stings a little more.

716
01:04:14,621 --> 01:04:16,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be completely transparent here.

717
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:21,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much I want to talk about this because this isn't my business and this isn't my thing to complain about.

718
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:26,624
[SPEAKER_09]: However, in this particular circumstance, I happen to know somebody that was affected by this.

719
01:04:27,224 --> 01:04:39,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm feeling a little bit extra jumpy on this or I feel a little extra snippy on this news because I've seen it personally affect somebody who says they will be fine and they are taking it personally.

720
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:40,687
[SPEAKER_09]: What can you do?

721
01:04:40,707 --> 01:04:41,347
[SPEAKER_09]: What can you do?

722
01:05:11,553 --> 01:05:18,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, something to think about when it's time to re-up your Game Pass subscription for the increased fee they're going to be charging this year.

723
01:05:18,902 --> 01:05:20,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Just putting that out there.

724
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:21,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Good thing I never got one to begin with.

725
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:22,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to think about.

726
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:24,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

727
01:05:24,368 --> 01:05:24,769
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

728
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:51,552
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so um it looks like that um oh gosh I hate when they put up these pop-ups okay so um Evercade is adding uh analog controller support in their latest update I don't have one of these it would be nice um but at any rate um

729
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the Evercade VS, I believe.

730
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:56,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

731
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks kind of like reverse Super Famicom colors.

732
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:07,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you can play your games that require a little bit more third dimensional activity.

733
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:09,403
[SPEAKER_03]: People have asked for it.

734
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:10,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on there.

735
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:29,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the games that have listed that will support it is Worms Armageddon, Speedball 2100, 40 Winks, Duke Nukem Last of the Babes, Duke Nukem Time to Kill, Glover, Tomb Raider 3, Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver.

736
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're also adding a cartridge eject feature.

737
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:38,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have the Evercade.

738
01:06:39,107 --> 01:06:42,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's Evercade Versus because it was the first one that has two players.

739
01:06:44,128 --> 01:06:46,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about them very well.

740
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:47,568
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually what I have.

741
01:06:47,648 --> 01:06:52,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will say the controller's kind of the weakest part of this system.

742
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:56,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of interesting that they're going to be adding this.

743
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this mean I can just pop in a PS5 controller?

744
01:06:58,691 --> 01:06:59,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that would actually be rad.

745
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:00,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here it is.

746
01:07:01,492 --> 01:07:03,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox, PlayStation, 8-bit, Dewpads.

747
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:03,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

748
01:07:03,512 --> 01:07:03,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

749
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:05,013
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

750
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:33,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so this makes sense that we're now seeing Sony removing Concord from players' accounts because, well, they did the whole mass refund on it.

751
01:07:33,241 --> 01:07:37,004
[SPEAKER_02]: You're obviously not going to get to keep a launcher for a game that doesn't exist anymore.

752
01:07:37,965 --> 01:07:46,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, yeah, late last week, they pulled down the servers and everything and they have removed it from the accounts.

753
01:07:46,372 --> 01:07:49,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this is while they determine their best path ahead.

754
01:07:50,776 --> 01:08:12,900
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've refunded everybody at least they're supposed to be refunding everyone PlayStation I think the Sony stuff was taking like a couple weeks but like PC they've already done all that so let's we'll have to wait and see what happens Concord is still going to be part of that series that Amazon has coming out in December so that's going to be interesting

755
01:08:13,446 --> 01:08:18,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we still see some sort of free-to-play version come out at some point as like a PlayStation Plus.

756
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:20,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

757
01:08:20,949 --> 01:08:28,812
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's... It's one of those things where it's like, yeah, it's kind of shitty that they're pulling it from people's accounts.

758
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:31,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of the whole PT.

759
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:34,495
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, they gave you your money back.

760
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:34,955
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't play it.

761
01:08:36,756 --> 01:09:01,715
[SPEAKER_09]: and they did give you the money back so it's like it feels a little less shitty I think it more stings in game preservation and that whole thing which you know we've kind of already talked about with this game that it you know it is a bit of a bummer that you will never be able to play this game as it was again but I also think you know if we cared that much shouldn't we have supported it when it first came out well but there but I was the game had its fans

762
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:03,336
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

763
01:09:19,997 --> 01:09:22,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But until we know, we don't know.

764
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So an E3VL points out PT, you can at least play it.

765
01:09:26,003 --> 01:09:29,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And Shayla, hi there, says PT, that one scary game I'm thinking of.

766
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:34,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that was the infamous trailer for Silent Hills, which never happened.

767
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:36,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of games that got canceled.

768
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:39,897
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was probably one of the most infamous demos of all time.

769
01:09:40,098 --> 01:09:40,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

770
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:55,807
[SPEAKER_09]: but also free so when they pulled it you can't exactly be pissed off because I paid for that no you didn't well I mean yeah I would still understand being angry it's the preservation standpoint like I fucking like that and I'd like to be able to play it again someday

771
01:09:56,587 --> 01:09:57,849
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

772
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:30,941
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole thing where now because of that, we can allow the corporate gremlins literally to come in in the middle of the night and take something off of my console, which has been happening ever since the PlayStation 3 days and the other OS thing that happened.

773
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:31,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

774
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:32,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

775
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:35,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that we are always online, the corporate...

776
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:57,126
[SPEAKER_09]: the corporate gremlins can come in in the middle of the night and take shit off of our consoles and that shit sucks that's the price we're paying for this convenience and this is why some people and yes it is a minority at this point but why some people are still clinging to physical media and you know because the physical I mean if you have Concord on disc

777
01:10:58,783 --> 01:11:16,766
[SPEAKER_09]: you have some it won't do much but you have something and now this is now the challenge to every hacker and home brewer working in a PlayStation 5 environment out there get Conker to work with the disc if you're the home brewer that figures that out they're gonna write ballads with your name

778
01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:21,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

779
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:26,411
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of those stories that's like, what?

780
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:27,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally what?

781
01:11:30,177 --> 01:11:34,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Annapurna Interactive, who actually publishes a lot of games.

782
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to make sure we're very clear.

783
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:37,822
[SPEAKER_09]: They are a publisher.

784
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:39,304
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not a creator.

785
01:11:39,984 --> 01:11:49,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though they have been behind some very big games that have been released over the years, things like Alan Wake, Control, some of those reasons, there's a lot of indie games they're behind.

786
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:51,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Annapurna publishes these games.

787
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:59,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be interesting to see what happens moving forward with these games because the entire staff resigned.

788
01:12:00,598 --> 01:12:16,332
[SPEAKER_09]: and this was the entire staff resigned yeah that's like trippy first off what a fucking power play like kudos honestly as weird as it is to be talking about this whole thing like that is the the

789
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:22,327
[SPEAKER_09]: The chutzpah, I think the word would be to pull a move like that.

790
01:12:22,347 --> 01:12:22,768
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

791
01:12:23,328 --> 01:12:24,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Chutzpah.

792
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:24,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

793
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:25,992
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what I mean.

794
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:27,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the point come across or did it not?

795
01:12:28,195 --> 01:12:30,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just an excuse for me to make the ch sound.

796
01:12:31,499 --> 01:12:34,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all had to do that is pretty impressive.

797
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:36,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let me get to the rest of what really happened here.

798
01:12:37,465 --> 01:12:49,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So the staff resigned following a dispute with the owner Megan Ellison, which again, I have also learned something this week, that she is the daughter of Oracle's Larry Ellison?

799
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:50,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that his name?

800
01:12:51,175 --> 01:12:53,616
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did not realize there was a connection there.

801
01:12:53,697 --> 01:12:53,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knew?

802
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:57,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So dickliness runs in the family?

803
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:01,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'd phrase it that way.

804
01:13:04,956 --> 01:13:16,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and the rest of the team were negotiating with Megan Ellison to spit off the division, publishing the video games, into an independent entity.

805
01:13:17,549 --> 01:13:20,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Megan Ellison backed out of those negotiations.

806
01:13:20,733 --> 01:13:25,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Nathan Gary and other executives and two dozen staff resigned.

807
01:13:26,127 --> 01:13:47,933
[SPEAKER_09]: a spokesperson for Annapurna Interactive well who's left at this point if they all resigned who's left but apparently there is a spokesperson maybe from the temp agency maybe Megan for Annapurna confirmed in a report to Bloomberg and Jason Schreier's reporting at Bloomberg that they had explored spinning off the company into an independent entity but there was a failure to reach an agreement

808
01:13:48,843 --> 01:13:56,589
[SPEAKER_09]: In a statement to Bloomberg, Megan Ellison said, Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition.

809
01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:11,341
[SPEAKER_09]: We're committed to not only our existing slate of games, but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming and theater.

810
01:14:12,122 --> 01:14:14,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to make a game when you don't have staff?

811
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:15,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're not making it.

812
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:16,165
[SPEAKER_09]: They're publishing it.

813
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:24,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be more difficult, but my thought is here's the reality.

814
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:36,879
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had thousands of people across the industry in these sorts of publishing roles that have been laid off and are looking for new jobs.

815
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:43,784
[SPEAKER_09]: If Annapurna wants to find talented individuals to fill these roles, they're probably not going to have a problem.

816
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:46,346
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the reality of the situation.

817
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:51,630
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it's even more like those folks literally quit publishing.

818
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:58,852
[SPEAKER_09]: In the state of the industry right now, that's why I say like it took, they obviously felt very strongly about what was going on.

819
01:14:59,232 --> 01:15:08,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it really sounds like those individuals, to quote a TV or movie adage, will be easily replaced.

820
01:15:10,216 --> 01:15:14,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mean that literally, but I feel like that's like the vibe I'm getting from these statements.

821
01:15:15,938 --> 01:15:16,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

822
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:23,339
[SPEAKER_09]: If a developer has a publishing contract with Annapurna, apparently they're scrambling to find new points of contact.

823
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:29,544
[SPEAKER_09]: But the same spokesperson had told Bloomberg that all existing games and projects are still under the company.

824
01:15:29,964 --> 01:15:40,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And the newly appointed president, Hector Sanchez, congrats on your ascension, has told developers it will honor existing contracts and replace the departed staff.

825
01:15:44,121 --> 01:15:44,722
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

826
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:07,803
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

827
01:16:24,978 --> 01:16:34,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, you're going to have Annapurna 2.0, but now you're going to have this mystery competitor yet to be announced, but I bet will be announced in the coming months.

828
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:40,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, y'all wanted more competition in the gaming industry, here you go.

829
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:45,003
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just a weird fucking way for it to happen.

830
01:16:50,316 --> 01:16:53,058
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJO and Hunter Matt says, what are the games Annapurna was working on?

831
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:54,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the publishing rights with?

832
01:16:54,339 --> 01:16:55,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Silent Hill Townfall?

833
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe you'll get a delay from this, but I don't, it's not going to stop the game from happening.

834
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:02,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Wild, wild, wild.

835
01:17:03,746 --> 01:17:06,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all right, let's move on.

836
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:08,309
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura on a very different note.

837
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:16,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, now, you know, we super, super, super support game preservation.

838
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:25,507
[SPEAKER_03]: What we don't support is making a profit off of game preservation, if you know what I mean.

839
01:17:26,248 --> 01:17:32,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, people going back and selling retro games.

840
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:40,335
[SPEAKER_03]: but pirated, rebuilt versions of them lying about what you're selling, basically

841
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:56,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is what actually was going on in Italy and this game ring that was worth 50 million euros was finally broken into by Italian police.

842
01:17:57,888 --> 01:18:01,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Fake vintage consoles and games.

843
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:03,394
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, that's about...

844
01:18:05,155 --> 01:18:06,957
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit over $55 million.

845
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: U.S.

846
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:09,980
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars.

847
01:18:10,801 --> 01:18:17,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there were games that were like Street Fighter 2, Super Mario Bros., Star Wars, you know, the stuff that people want.

848
01:18:17,828 --> 01:18:19,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that there were like

849
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:24,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the really big ones that people will actually pay top dollar for.

850
01:18:26,314 --> 01:18:37,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Just taking advantage of the whole retro gaming swing, they said it was about 12,000 consoles and over 47 million pirated games.

851
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,301
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

852
01:18:59,173 --> 01:18:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot.

853
01:19:00,094 --> 01:19:06,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he also said that these are from all over China and were imported to be sold in specialized shops or online.

854
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: They were fitted with non-certified batteries and electrical circuits and did not pass EU technical or safety standards.

855
01:19:16,805 --> 01:19:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: The games and consoles have been destroyed.

856
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:28,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine Italian nationals have been arrested and charged with trading in counterfeited goods and they can face up to eight years in prison.

857
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:46,102
[SPEAKER_03]: um yeah it's you know when we have in a world where you know sealed copies of you know retro games are selling for ridiculous amounts of money yeah

858
01:19:47,045 --> 01:19:48,566
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't surprise me.

859
01:19:49,366 --> 01:19:51,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that they were able to knock that down.

860
01:19:54,088 --> 01:20:06,614
[SPEAKER_09]: 100% what you just said there about that people are realizing there's money to be made in the game collection area and people are willing to do seedy things to pass things off as things that aren't legit.

861
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:16,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember one time, this is not quite the same thing, but this is how I learned that lesson, that there are people that will try to pass things off or maybe misrepresent it a little bit.

862
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:20,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at Denio's auction, right?

863
01:20:20,303 --> 01:20:21,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Out in Roseville, right?

864
01:20:21,444 --> 01:20:22,486
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit of local stuff.

865
01:20:22,506 --> 01:20:23,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Peter Dan still out there?

866
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:26,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who it was that I bought from, and I don't know.

867
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:29,735
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because the place across the street is no longer there.

868
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:32,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was when I was in the place across the street from Denio's.

869
01:20:32,298 --> 01:20:32,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

870
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:33,079
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?

871
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:33,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember where that place was.

872
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:34,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Also...

873
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: The purchase I regret the most ever.

874
01:20:37,824 --> 01:20:50,151
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a full-on BurgerTime cabinet, legitimate cabinet that they were selling for $400 and I should have fucking bought it that day because then that place closed like a month later and I never will see one of those that cheap again.

875
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:50,511
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

876
01:20:51,171 --> 01:20:51,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I digress.

877
01:20:52,112 --> 01:21:00,017
[SPEAKER_09]: What I really bought that day is I found for the Super Nintendo, I was like, oh my gosh, it's a sealed copy of Clue for the Super Nintendo.

878
01:21:00,097 --> 01:21:00,958
[SPEAKER_09]: This is incredible.

879
01:21:01,298 --> 01:21:02,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to buy this.

880
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:04,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love Clue on the Super Nintendo.

881
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck yeah, I'm going to buy this.

882
01:21:05,381 --> 01:21:08,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I bought it and I brought it home and I took it because I wanted to fucking play it.

883
01:21:09,003 --> 01:21:10,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So I took it out of the ceiling and then realized,

884
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:15,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, all the cards in here and the instruction manual on the game, they've already been filled out.

885
01:21:15,386 --> 01:21:16,086
[SPEAKER_09]: People use this.

886
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:18,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody just resealed this game.

887
01:21:19,387 --> 01:21:21,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, in fairness, that was my mistake.

888
01:21:22,088 --> 01:21:29,470
[SPEAKER_09]: The person wasn't trying to pass it off as like sealed brand new, but the presenting on the shelf gave that impression.

889
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:31,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this person didn't do anything illegal.

890
01:21:31,991 --> 01:21:34,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying I learned a lesson that day.

891
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:38,512
[SPEAKER_09]: How easy it is to represent a collectible.

892
01:21:38,532 --> 01:21:39,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it shrink-wrapped?

893
01:21:39,653 --> 01:21:40,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that whole thing.

894
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:44,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You can usually tell by the kind of shrink wrapping.

895
01:21:44,512 --> 01:21:47,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, but that was the whole like, oh, fuck, I need to learn that lesson.

896
01:21:48,734 --> 01:22:00,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it just goes to show not just that, but to reseal or shrink wrap or whatever, or now what people can do is dumping their own cartridges.

897
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:08,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Loki has his own Pixel Poops 2 on legitimate cartridges that he did, he put together.

898
01:22:08,728 --> 01:22:09,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I still want one.

899
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:10,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

900
01:22:10,589 --> 01:22:11,329
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on.

901
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:11,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

902
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:49,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so this has been going on for a while, like this whole controversy with Unity and changing other prices, and they kind of backed down from that.

903
01:22:49,763 --> 01:22:55,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And the new thing that was supposed to be coming is that runtime beat with the new versions of Unity.

904
01:22:56,189 --> 01:22:57,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's supposed to be starting in 2025.

905
01:23:01,354 --> 01:23:22,171
[SPEAKER_02]: but now almost a year later after they announced their changes and then walked that back they are not going to be implementing the runtime fee and Unity will return to a subscription model with that the personal license will remain free until the game has brought in $200,000 in revenue

906
01:23:25,799 --> 01:23:37,295
[SPEAKER_02]: or funding and then also a Unity Pro subscription though however will increase by 8% to $2,200 a year and Enterprise will also increase by 25% um

907
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:43,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, other changes.

908
01:23:43,915 --> 01:23:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So previously, the Unity Personal was capped at, it was $100,000 is where you had to hit it before you had to pay the fee.

909
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they have upped that to $200,000.

910
01:23:56,025 --> 01:24:01,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the Made with Unity splash screen will still be optional for games developed with Unity 6.

911
01:24:03,691 --> 01:24:06,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's set to launch later this year.

912
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:10,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's everything.

913
01:24:10,231 --> 01:24:30,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they said, yeah, with the Unity Enterprise, it says experience, you know, their 25% increase with new minimum subscription requirements for customers generating over $25 million in annual revenue, which, yeah, when I see them, I'm like, I'm never going to see that kind of money ever in anything.

914
01:24:31,994 --> 01:24:38,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, interesting that, you know, it's almost in some ways quietly reverted all this time later after the controversy.

915
01:24:38,316 --> 01:24:42,837
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still notable that it's happened this way, so.

916
01:24:43,398 --> 01:24:50,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and with that, like, even though they've walked everything back, I think there's folks that are just still hesitant about it.

917
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, they did it this time, but what...

918
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to happen the next time they want to change something?

919
01:24:57,562 --> 01:25:00,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, not to keep drilling this home, but I'm going to.

920
01:25:00,643 --> 01:25:05,764
[SPEAKER_09]: The perception of Unity now, based on how quick they made that change, yeah, not a great look.

921
01:25:07,245 --> 01:25:09,145
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to take time to earn that trust back, right?

922
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:14,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And decisions were made that week to pivot to other platforms when all that shit went down with Unity.

923
01:25:15,087 --> 01:25:19,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were decisions you can't go back on at a certain point.

924
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:26,055
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, but this is Unity continuing to try to get that trust back with a lot of people, I think.

925
01:25:27,896 --> 01:25:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: A year later.

926
01:25:28,877 --> 01:25:29,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

927
01:25:29,278 --> 01:25:30,819
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

928
01:25:31,638 --> 01:25:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's talk about the PlayStation 5 and a firmware update that happened this week that is going to be adding.

929
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:41,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen this yet, but I also haven't launched my PlayStation 5 today.

930
01:25:41,463 --> 01:25:44,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I launched it the day the firmware update went out and I didn't see this.

931
01:25:45,144 --> 01:25:47,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's slowly rolling out across the coming days.

932
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:49,006
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of you may have seen it.

933
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:51,387
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a customizable home screen.

934
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:52,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be a little bit different.

935
01:25:53,508 --> 01:25:55,849
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have a new welcome hub on your PlayStation 5.

936
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:59,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're saying it's basically like a canvas that you can fill with widgets.

937
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:05,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really reminded of cell phones because iOS and Android both do this in their own ways.

938
01:26:05,614 --> 01:26:12,758
[SPEAKER_09]: You have these different widgets you can put on your home screen of the phone that show you like, here's the weather, here's the battery charge.

939
01:26:12,838 --> 01:26:19,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the one on iOS that lets you see the battery charge on all your devices at once so I know if I need to plug something in.

940
01:26:20,202 --> 01:26:20,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So

941
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very that, but for Sony.

942
01:26:23,245 --> 01:26:26,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can see things like, again, battery level for accessories.

943
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:31,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see your storage space, which of your friends are online, which trophies you've recently gotten, and all that stuff.

944
01:26:31,995 --> 01:26:35,078
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to replace the Explore tab that's currently there.

945
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:37,841
[SPEAKER_09]: You can resize and arrange things, which is cool.

946
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:39,203
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a way that you can customize.

947
01:26:39,784 --> 01:26:41,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can change the background.

948
01:26:41,886 --> 01:26:43,207
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

949
01:26:54,622 --> 01:26:55,663
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

950
01:27:14,744 --> 01:27:21,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in this update, a little lesser known feature, but personalized 3D audio profiles.

951
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:28,798
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have headphones or earbuds, this will let you make various adjustments to better fit unique hearing characteristics.

952
01:27:29,318 --> 01:27:34,119
[SPEAKER_09]: This is currently in beta, but look forward to more updates and all that good stuff.

953
01:27:34,179 --> 01:27:38,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, party voice chat links will be able to be shared on messaging or social media.

954
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:45,541
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could literally drop a messaging link on threads or something and people could join your chats.

955
01:27:45,901 --> 01:27:47,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I could go to Discord or something and do that.

956
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:50,982
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be very interesting, even if you're not friends on the PlayStation Network.

957
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:55,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you'd want to use that responsibly, but I could see that kind of opening up different things.

958
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:57,945
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

959
01:27:58,826 --> 01:28:04,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason also pointing out, since I brought up cell phones, Jason mentioning iOS 18 lands tomorrow.

960
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,351
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty big deal in the Apple world.

961
01:28:07,872 --> 01:28:15,538
[SPEAKER_09]: He also continues, widgets and personalization on a gaming console, of course, makes sense, but doing the same stuff as a phone does seem silly.

962
01:28:15,778 --> 01:28:25,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it feels like it's... I don't think it's going to show weather and news headlines like your phone does, but I think it's going to show things that are relevant to the PlayStation console, which I think is kind of interesting.

963
01:28:25,584 --> 01:28:25,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

964
01:28:26,405 --> 01:28:35,332
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I did order an iPhone Pro Max 16 a couple days ago because I had a lot of credit at work.

965
01:28:35,512 --> 01:28:37,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, eh, what the heck?

966
01:28:37,934 --> 01:28:40,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we get incentives that we can trade in for gift cards.

967
01:28:41,377 --> 01:28:46,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just stock up Apple gift cards because I know Rob loves expensive toys from Apple.

968
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:49,703
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just stock up the Apple gift cards and cash them in.

969
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:53,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you privately.

970
01:28:54,227 --> 01:28:54,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay.

971
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:01,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason in chat says, I may have also pre-ordered a 16 Pro Max today.

972
01:29:01,692 --> 01:29:02,512
[SPEAKER_09]: May have.

973
01:29:03,032 --> 01:29:04,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like you did.

974
01:29:04,933 --> 01:29:05,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what?

975
01:29:05,493 --> 01:29:09,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to do it twice because the first time I forgot to apply my balance, but I got it all sorted out.

976
01:29:09,974 --> 01:29:10,354
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

977
01:29:10,414 --> 01:29:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

978
01:29:11,194 --> 01:29:12,635
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm excited.

979
01:29:13,235 --> 01:29:13,515
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

980
01:29:14,596 --> 01:29:15,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm due.

981
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:15,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm due.

982
01:29:16,376 --> 01:29:16,676
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

983
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

984
01:29:17,777 --> 01:29:19,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's travel back to a simpler time.

985
01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:19,817
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

986
01:29:20,117 --> 01:29:21,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Your consoles didn't have widgets.

987
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:24,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Your cell phones didn't tell you the weather.

988
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:32,482
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to know the time, you called time, and it would say, at the sound of the tone, the time will be 7.35 p.m.

989
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:33,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Beep.

990
01:29:35,383 --> 01:29:37,263
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you knew the fucking time on your phone.

991
01:29:37,884 --> 01:29:39,024
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the classic game of the week.

992
01:29:39,044 --> 01:29:40,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Was yours British?

993
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:41,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually...

994
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:44,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to digress?

995
01:29:44,892 --> 01:29:46,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we are, before I roll the bumper.

996
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:49,698
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to have, I wish I remember the phone number.

997
01:29:49,858 --> 01:29:51,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, maybe you remember this.

998
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, I think it was, it was something, it was a gag we used to do on Under Sedation Live.

999
01:29:57,631 --> 01:29:59,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the number was 332-2222.

1000
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:04,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't call it because I don't think this exists anymore.

1001
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:09,426
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you would call it, it would go, hello, my name is Mona.

1002
01:30:10,247 --> 01:30:13,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the sound of the moan, the time will be 736 p.m.

1003
01:30:18,897 --> 01:30:44,238
[SPEAKER_09]: and that was the thing and then it would play an ad it played an ad for some porn site or 900 number or something but I just remember that Mona was like the alternative to time I sort of remember I feel like every I feel like every teenage boy knew about Mona all right uh where was I oh yes classic game here we go

1004
01:30:55,037 --> 01:31:02,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1005
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1006
01:31:05,921 --> 01:31:07,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a pretty rad game tonight, DarkSakura.

1007
01:31:07,882 --> 01:31:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you pick?

1008
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:15,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked, I was like, because we don't have the wiki and I didn't want to decode all the XML.

1009
01:31:15,482 --> 01:31:18,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DT, for sending me the XML of the site.

1010
01:31:18,465 --> 01:31:21,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkTetsuya is working on that and thinks he can get it back.

1011
01:31:21,447 --> 01:31:27,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there was a problem with one of the transcripts that had some dirty language in it that the website didn't like.

1012
01:31:27,772 --> 01:31:30,495
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, sorry, but you reminded me to make that update.

1013
01:31:30,535 --> 01:31:30,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Jamie.

1014
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:35,071
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is Super Don Quixote.

1015
01:31:36,932 --> 01:31:38,653
[SPEAKER_03]: They spell it really weird.

1016
01:31:39,813 --> 01:31:44,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Q-U-I-X-O-T-E when there wasn't that in the original novel.

1017
01:31:47,897 --> 01:31:52,199
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, it was a Laserdisc video game that was released by Universal in 1984.

1018
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:58,643
[SPEAKER_03]: You play as the knight Don to rescue a princess from a witch named Leona.

1019
01:31:59,503 --> 01:32:12,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very loosely based on the novel Don Quixote, which, if you've never read Don Quixote, it just sounds like such a weird thing to derive from.

1020
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:18,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I love the full title being The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.

1021
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:23,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also kind of a parody novel.

1022
01:32:23,311 --> 01:32:24,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, back to the game.

1023
01:32:28,025 --> 01:32:31,886
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Dragon's Lair in Space Ace.

1024
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:40,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the icon that points out which of your little quick time events to do.

1025
01:32:43,088 --> 01:32:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually has the overlay that shows you.

1026
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:52,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the other ones didn't do anything except giving you a flash that's incorporated into the animation.

1027
01:32:54,190 --> 01:33:18,364
[SPEAKER_03]: so basically you are Don who is trying to save Princess Isabella from Leona who is going to sacrifice her to a demon he has a donkey that goes with him that's based on the original Don Quixote's horse I always mispronounce this

1028
01:33:19,224 --> 01:33:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosinante and a fat little man called Sancho that is based on Sancho Panza who is his sidekick in the book.

1029
01:33:32,396 --> 01:33:32,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You

1030
01:33:34,478 --> 01:33:45,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Really the only big things that has in common with the book, apart from some certain character names, is the fight at the giant windmill, but everything else is really fucking weird.

1031
01:33:45,525 --> 01:33:56,312
[SPEAKER_03]: You fight a mummy, a dragon, skeletons, demons, giant snakes, flying electric jellyfish, a totem pole, Leona's daughter, and a bunch of other stuff that has nothing to do with the book!

1032
01:33:57,793 --> 01:33:58,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

1033
01:34:00,396 --> 01:34:05,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you slay the lady, the witch, and you go home.

1034
01:34:06,078 --> 01:34:06,758
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

1035
01:34:07,818 --> 01:34:20,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the first and only game that was ever released on the Universal System 1, which was supposed to be a standard Laserdisc video game system.

1036
01:34:20,563 --> 01:34:26,625
[SPEAKER_03]: They had other games that were planned for it that were never released, including Adventure Middle-Earth, Adventure Time Mr. Do,

1037
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:31,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Timeslip, Circus Circus, Space Dracula, and Wilderness Kingdom.

1038
01:34:32,009 --> 01:34:33,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Space Dracula, okay?

1039
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:41,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game from Universal that followed a similar format was Captain Zap, which is a motorbike combat game.

1040
01:34:42,981 --> 01:34:43,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1041
01:34:44,622 --> 01:34:52,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also the only Laserdisc game to be demonstrated at London's Associated Leisure Preview 86 or Arcadia 86 show they did in October 1985.

1042
01:34:52,885 --> 01:35:07,750
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, Game Machine listed this on their December 15, 1984 issue as being the most successful upright arcade unit of the month.

1043
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:27,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Computer and Video Games gave it a positive review in December 1984, saying that the movements of all characters are smooth and beautifully depicted, really praising the animation, that they didn't think it was as much fun as Dragon's Lair, but said that Don Quixote was a lot less frustrating.

1044
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:34,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, pretty decently well-received, just, you know, didn't have Don Bluth behind it.

1045
01:35:35,311 --> 01:35:36,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

1046
01:35:37,352 --> 01:35:37,632
[SPEAKER_03]: But

1047
01:35:39,724 --> 01:36:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a pretty good one and I'm trying to actually see where the art house for this was but I'm not finding that in this article but at any rate they had one at California Extreme I played it for a hot minute but you know it's cute

1048
01:36:07,659 --> 01:36:07,979
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

1049
01:36:08,019 --> 01:36:10,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was just going to say, you're absolutely right.

1050
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Don Bluth, but I feel like they're kind of trying to go for that vibe still.

1051
01:36:15,623 --> 01:36:16,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they are.

1052
01:36:17,024 --> 01:36:18,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It's why it's hard to figure out who it is.

1053
01:36:19,986 --> 01:36:27,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And Don Bluth's animation is rather striking because it still has that kind of Disney vibe to it.

1054
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:31,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has a very anime vibe to it, you know?

1055
01:36:31,472 --> 01:36:31,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1056
01:36:31,712 --> 01:36:31,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1057
01:36:33,648 --> 01:36:37,731
[SPEAKER_03]: The animation in it, I thought, is really nice.

1058
01:36:37,811 --> 01:36:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really smooth and really good.

1059
01:36:41,014 --> 01:36:42,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly, this had a budget.

1060
01:36:42,815 --> 01:36:44,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when you consider, again, this is 1984.

1061
01:36:45,477 --> 01:36:48,379
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not something that was made in the 90s, even.

1062
01:36:48,419 --> 01:36:50,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty old.

1063
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:53,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We had other games, though.

1064
01:36:53,143 --> 01:36:56,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the VHS and DVD games that came out later?

1065
01:36:56,665 --> 01:36:57,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.

1066
01:36:58,297 --> 01:37:02,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but this has nothing to do with the novel.

1067
01:37:02,919 --> 01:37:03,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1068
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:04,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1069
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:13,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, still, a very unique sort of game, and as SHO100Matt puts it in chat, I've never seen this game before, and now I kind of want to play it.

1070
01:37:13,462 --> 01:37:16,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would call that another successful Classic Game of the Week.

1071
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:42,946
[SPEAKER_09]: all right thank you for that DarkSakura good pick good pick and hopefully we have a wiki working again next week uh so we could because we we use that as a resource ourselves and making sure we don't repeat things i use it too for the little bumps at the beginning i'm like have i made this joke before so it's important i do cliff jumper as a game

1072
01:37:43,854 --> 01:37:44,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I did.

1073
01:37:45,975 --> 01:37:47,637
[SPEAKER_03]: The loop in the third one.

1074
01:37:49,057 --> 01:37:50,078
[SPEAKER_09]: There ought to be a way.

1075
01:37:50,138 --> 01:37:54,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess it sounds like Dark Titsy already did that to get that file so you can at least open that.

1076
01:37:54,641 --> 01:37:56,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the XML.

1077
01:37:57,103 --> 01:38:00,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly didn't necessarily have a bunch of time.

1078
01:38:00,185 --> 01:38:02,046
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, let me open it in my XML editor.

1079
01:38:02,726 --> 01:38:03,227
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, all right.

1080
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:10,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, while you plot out the next few classic games until we have a wiki back, let's... Dr. Sia says, stay tuned.

1081
01:38:10,172 --> 01:38:12,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hopeful to be back before post-TwitchCon.

1082
01:38:12,754 --> 01:38:15,136
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, appreciate all your hard work on that for sure.

1083
01:38:15,957 --> 01:38:19,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I didn't even know we had transcripts on there.

1084
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:29,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought 13 Forever had their own transcript archive, which is... Because they had that software that did everything, which again...

1085
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:32,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... You know, here's the thing.

1086
01:38:32,862 --> 01:38:37,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine with you all who have been listening to this show for a long time and supporting this show a long time.

1087
01:38:37,285 --> 01:38:42,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if you want to find an old in-joke or something, I'm fine with you having access to transcripts.

1088
01:38:42,429 --> 01:38:48,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Who I don't want having access to transcripts are people that are trying to dig old shit up on us to try to cancel us with.

1089
01:38:49,254 --> 01:38:50,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't fucking play that game with me.

1090
01:38:51,095 --> 01:38:59,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this show has been around for 22 years, and I've said it time and again, there is shit in the old episodes that was said I would not say today because...

1091
01:39:00,202 --> 01:39:01,203
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1092
01:39:21,818 --> 01:39:26,982
[SPEAKER_09]: You all that, you know, I know you all are just looking for, oh, when was the first time they brought this up?

1093
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:42,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like Loki, you had a really good, you were trying to figure out when Time to Penis originated on this show because you thought it could have been before what was being mentioned in some of the mainstream gaming media as the first instance of it.

1094
01:39:42,334 --> 01:39:46,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it turns out it was the same year, but not technically before, at least what we can find.

1095
01:39:47,138 --> 01:39:47,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

1096
01:39:47,919 --> 01:39:48,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1097
01:39:49,780 --> 01:40:00,751
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, and this is just offering it really to anybody, if you are wanting something that's good for helping you read through XML or for doing Python coding, definitely look at Brackets.

1098
01:40:01,892 --> 01:40:03,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really good little app.

1099
01:40:05,996 --> 01:40:11,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like right now why I'm able to go in and just copy off the list of classic games in plain text.

1100
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:12,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1101
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:12,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1102
01:40:14,203 --> 01:40:42,577
[SPEAKER_09]: and then so my point with the whole transcript discussion was just delete all the transcripts off the wiki it's not needed just it's fine you know what I would just rather if apparently there's problematic shit in it I would just rather it not be out there anyway so because it probably wasn't wasn't funny so just just delete it it's cool we we need that we want the useful shit like the episode summaries the classic game of the week and that type of stuff if somebody really wants a transcript they can go download the episode and there's tools to help you do that so

1103
01:40:43,297 --> 01:40:43,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, cool.

1104
01:40:43,917 --> 01:40:45,297
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says that was the plan.

1105
01:40:45,457 --> 01:40:45,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1106
01:40:46,218 --> 01:40:46,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear ya.

1107
01:40:46,678 --> 01:40:47,038
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

1108
01:40:47,078 --> 01:40:47,398
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

1109
01:40:47,758 --> 01:40:48,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1110
01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:53,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some rapid fire news and cover some other headlines real quick.

1111
01:40:53,939 --> 01:40:54,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we'll go to you.

1112
01:40:56,119 --> 01:41:03,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's now news that Tony Hawk is working on something with Activision.

1113
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:09,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee, I wonder what it could be that you would be working on with Activision.

1114
01:41:10,162 --> 01:41:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could tell you more.

1115
01:41:11,752 --> 01:41:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: but I can't tell you that I or I can tell you that I've been working or talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting we're working on something this will be the first time I've said that publicly cool looking forward to it um

1116
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:54,661
[SPEAKER_02]: and then as people do with popular celebrities or people that have come into the spotlight a bit more recently since Tim Walls, the Democratic Vice President nominee mentioned that he used the game on the Dreamcast someone took it upon themselves to add him as a playable character in Dreamcast

1117
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:58,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy Taxi, thanks to a mod.

1118
01:42:00,663 --> 01:42:24,226
[SPEAKER_09]: that's that's brilliant I I think this is funny as fuck actually uh and I love that someone did this um interesting because we were talking about like the trademark and all that stuff you know using his likeness in the mod is that acceptable and actually another interesting sort of perk of uh law in that because he is a well-known federal politician uh the the parody is considered fair game

1119
01:42:24,827 --> 01:42:26,828
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1120
01:42:49,324 --> 01:42:52,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, my political leanings are no fucking secret on this show.

1121
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:55,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the world of Tim Walls, I think he's fantastic.

1122
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:58,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love that somebody put him in Crazy Taxi.

1123
01:42:58,432 --> 01:42:58,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great.

1124
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:02,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I interject something real quick?

1125
01:43:02,495 --> 01:43:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1126
01:43:04,116 --> 01:43:06,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this kind of goes back to something.

1127
01:43:06,558 --> 01:43:12,683
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember how I talked about the people who were doing the Keitai game preservation?

1128
01:43:12,703 --> 01:43:12,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1129
01:43:13,843 --> 01:43:17,366
[SPEAKER_03]: and how there had been like some that were still missing that they couldn't find.

1130
01:43:18,267 --> 01:43:23,171
[SPEAKER_03]: They found one of the missing Professor Layton games.

1131
01:43:23,571 --> 01:43:24,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

1132
01:43:25,593 --> 01:43:28,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Professor Layton and the Mansion of Deathly Mirror.

1133
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:32,558
[SPEAKER_03]: They found it on a phone that survived a house fire.

1134
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:34,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1135
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:38,523
[SPEAKER_03]: All six chapters on an F906i.

1136
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:42,146
[SPEAKER_03]: They had before only had the first three chapters.

1137
01:43:42,286 --> 01:43:43,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they have them all.

1138
01:43:44,631 --> 01:44:02,220
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was also Mr. Driller Aqua and yeah so those were other games that they thought they were either never going to get the complete version of or at all lost games now alive and well on a survivor of a keitai

1139
01:44:03,676 --> 01:44:04,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd throw that out there.

1140
01:44:05,097 --> 01:44:08,459
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so wild, the things that just turn up in the most random places.

1141
01:44:08,519 --> 01:44:14,723
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like going garage sale in Silicon Valley and finding a prototype cartridge you would have never thought.

1142
01:44:15,203 --> 01:44:15,723
[SPEAKER_09]: It's wild.

1143
01:44:16,804 --> 01:44:21,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I picked up this junk for you at the flea market.

1144
01:44:22,367 --> 01:44:23,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you find an Appalisa?

1145
01:44:23,888 --> 01:44:24,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?

1146
01:44:27,989 --> 01:44:31,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Where did you find a black label version of Symphony of the Night on PlayStation 1?

1147
01:44:32,655 --> 01:44:34,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I find those all the time.

1148
01:44:35,559 --> 01:44:36,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that rare?

1149
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:39,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there some Konami PlayStation game that's super rare?

1150
01:44:39,104 --> 01:44:40,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Suikoden, probably.

1151
01:44:41,365 --> 01:44:58,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, well, I have both versions of Final Fantasy VII, and we had the import of Symphony first, of Nocturne and the Moonlight, and then got the US one as soon as it came out, because this was Dan.

1152
01:45:00,677 --> 01:45:01,017
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1153
01:45:01,978 --> 01:45:03,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, DarkSakura, you have a rapid-fire story for us.

01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1155
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:07,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a plan!

1156
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:09,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fun to say, tell a plan.

1157
01:45:10,223 --> 01:45:10,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1158
01:45:11,318 --> 01:45:25,740
[SPEAKER_03]: excuse me I'm sorry I just had a choke on something they are doing reissues of more Toaplan shmups Slap Fight and Grindstormer

01:51:28,146 --> 01:51:30,747
[SPEAKER_09]: You are a sentient bread on a quest...

1218
01:51:35,159 --> 01:51:58,904
[SPEAKER_09]: you play as a flower golem that's F-L-O-U-R a flower golem who possesses a never-ending childlike wonder and a set of odd abilities it comes with a home-cooked battle system should be a home-baked battle system I don't know and team up with your buddies because Loaf, the main character can't do it alone

1219
01:52:00,689 --> 01:52:08,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna know what rabbi ran out of rocks and decided to make a golem out of flour.

1220
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:15,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna know how fucking high did somebody get when they decided to make... Hey, hey, hey, man.

1221
01:52:16,051 --> 01:52:16,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey.

1222
01:52:18,532 --> 01:52:19,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good one.

1223
01:52:19,293 --> 01:52:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Try Board of Sativa is what this game sounds like to me.

1224
01:52:22,974 --> 01:52:29,116
[SPEAKER_01]: What if, man, what if, what if, what if Fred could walk?

1225
01:52:29,216 --> 01:52:31,217
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly on the Switch Japan this week...

1226
01:52:32,905 --> 01:52:36,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Kama Itachi no Yoru is also out on the Switch.

1227
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:38,089
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the PlayStation 5?

1228
01:52:38,169 --> 01:52:42,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have Death End Request Code Z. Bang on Balls Chronicles is there as well.

1229
01:52:42,952 --> 01:52:45,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Also a game called Candle Night is there as well.

1230
01:52:45,494 --> 01:52:53,259
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't get enough bread, you can get more on the PS5 as Board of Bread is also out on the PlayStation 5 in Japan this week.

1231
01:52:53,619 --> 01:52:54,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.

1232
01:52:54,620 --> 01:53:02,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I named this game after the club I went to Bang on Balls because that's all they did all night.

1233
01:53:04,466 --> 01:53:05,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm done.

1234
01:53:05,686 --> 01:53:06,787
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Europe, DarkSakura?

1235
01:53:09,008 --> 01:53:09,948
[SPEAKER_03]: We ain't seen shit.

1236
01:53:09,968 --> 01:53:10,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1237
01:53:10,588 --> 01:53:15,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, on the 16th, we have Phoenix Falls for PC.

1238
01:53:17,171 --> 01:53:21,592
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 17th, Throne and Liberty for PC, PS5, Xboxes, blah blah.

1239
01:53:21,973 --> 01:53:24,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 16 also for PC on the 17th.

1240
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:44,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Star Wars Jedi Survivor, PS4, Xbox One, The Plicky Squire, all the things, Enotria, the last song for PC, UFO 50 on the 18th, Enotria for PS5 on the 19th, God of War Ragnarok for PC on 19th.

1241
01:53:45,529 --> 01:53:47,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess a re-release or something?

1242
01:53:48,110 --> 01:54:11,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Broken Sword, Shadow of the Templars for all of the things also on the 19th Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster on the 19th Monument Valley on Netflix Bzzzt on Switch on the 19th Frostpunk 2 for PC on the 20th I'm sorry, how many Z's in Bzzzt?

1243
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:16,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that many

1244
01:54:18,254 --> 01:54:24,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh is that it?

1245
01:54:28,137 --> 01:54:32,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could go another week after that since I won't be here, but no.

1246
01:54:32,618 --> 01:54:32,998
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1247
01:54:33,058 --> 01:54:33,418
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1248
01:54:34,499 --> 01:54:36,179
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let it be a surprise for people.

1249
01:54:36,739 --> 01:54:36,919
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1250
01:54:36,939 --> 01:54:38,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, none of us will be here next week.

1251
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we said that, but there's no show next week.

1252
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:42,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki and DarkSakura at TwitchCon.

1253
01:54:42,581 --> 01:54:46,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not doing a show by myself, but also I'm in Seattle for completely unrelated reasons.

1254
01:54:47,142 --> 01:54:48,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not here.

1255
01:54:48,322 --> 01:54:52,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf will be here, though, to hold down the fort and catch you up on all the news of the week.

1256
01:54:52,643 --> 01:54:55,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So check that out for those of you here live at the Voice Geeks Network.

1257
01:54:56,164 --> 01:55:00,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we have a few more headlines for you and then we'll see if there's any calls or any of that good stuff.

1258
01:55:00,787 --> 01:55:03,088
[SPEAKER_09]: But Loki, you have some Minecraft news.

1259
01:55:04,309 --> 01:55:12,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we were just waiting to hear what's going on with Minecraft Live because that's usually around middle of October.

1260
01:55:13,755 --> 01:55:21,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But Minecraft put out, or I should say Mojang put out an announcement talking about changes to how they're going to be doing updates.

1261
01:55:24,001 --> 01:55:25,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So my opinion is that they're just...

1262
01:55:27,332 --> 01:55:31,556
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of trying to do less.

1263
01:55:31,616 --> 01:55:36,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're trying less hard now, I guess, with updates.

1264
01:55:37,282 --> 01:55:41,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Being that there's no more themed updates anymore.

1265
01:55:41,666 --> 01:55:48,093
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to try... I mean, they've already said that they were going to be doing this, trying to push out smaller updates instead of just waiting for...

1266
01:55:48,593 --> 01:56:07,602
[SPEAKER_02]: A larger update release so there's gonna be lots of sub updates which sucks for mod developers because then you have to constantly update your mods every time they break stuff which is all the time especially now that they're going to like a component-based system on the back end so it's kind of changing how everything's structured but in the long run it'll be nice

1267
01:56:08,362 --> 01:56:13,384
[SPEAKER_02]: They are now confirming that they're going to be doing two Minecraft Live showcases instead of one.

1268
01:56:14,844 --> 01:56:16,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not confirming when that first one's going to be.

1269
01:56:17,365 --> 01:56:22,287
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's still going to be in October and then there'll be like another one in the spring or what the case may be.

1270
01:56:24,249 --> 01:56:53,557
[SPEAKER_02]: so we're just going to kind of wait to hear about that hopefully in the next couple weeks we'll get a date on that because that should be right around the corner oh and mob votes are going away so that's a big one because it's pretty contentious typically with Minecraft Live they have the Minecraft players vote on which mob they want in the next update and you know in the past you've had like large creators like Dream manipulated to put the crappiest mob of the bunch in there you've had

1271
01:56:55,129 --> 01:57:20,474
[SPEAKER_02]: other votes seem to be kind of manipulated or just like weird so now they're just getting rid of it all together honestly I don't understand why they do it that way in the first place it really should have just been here's three mobs we're going to bring them to the game which one do you want in there first and we'll prioritize that one and then the other two will come in later on like that would be the best way to do it but that's not how they operate so whatever um

1272
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:27,976
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so that's what we're looking forward to more announcements and smaller updates.

1273
01:57:28,516 --> 01:57:34,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, with the theme stuff, the last few updates that they've done with Tricky Trials and...

1274
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:38,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if that's... Trails and Tales.

1275
01:57:38,673 --> 01:57:46,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's felt very... Here's some features we have done and we're going to shove them all together and what kind of theme does that feel like, you know, with that?

1276
01:57:46,976 --> 01:57:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not kind of working towards a theme.

1277
01:57:49,157 --> 01:57:56,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of here's what we have done and it's the tricky trials.

1278
01:57:56,599 --> 01:57:58,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it because the trial chambers are in here.

1279
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's the armored...

1280
01:58:02,011 --> 01:58:30,356
[SPEAKER_02]: dog armored armadillo one it's got dog armor and armadillos yay um so I think they're just now they're just not even going to try to come up with a theme for it and it'll be just like okay this is what's coming out and here's what it is and stuff like that but I know there's lots of tweaks that they're doing I'm just kind of curious about when all that's going to come out and what what that means to the game because they're retooling a lot of stuff um will we be getting a Minecraft update on who won the fucking Mega Man competition

1281
01:58:34,606 --> 01:58:35,646
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an old joke.

1282
01:58:35,786 --> 01:58:36,947
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming.

1283
01:58:37,187 --> 01:58:38,507
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still deliberating.

1284
01:58:38,527 --> 01:58:40,688
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an old joke at this point, for those that don't get the joke.

1285
01:58:41,168 --> 01:58:48,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki created an incredible fucking Mega Man build that absolutely would win this competition, but we'll never know because Microsoft never named a winner.

1286
01:58:49,152 --> 01:58:50,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, they never named a winner.

1287
01:58:50,272 --> 01:58:56,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It was their first... Well, it wasn't the first, but it was one of the first feature-me Minecraft...

1288
01:58:58,459 --> 01:58:58,939
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

1289
01:59:23,639 --> 01:59:29,423
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point was that it was supposed to be everyone does steampunk or they do cyberpunk and stuff like that.

1290
01:59:29,963 --> 01:59:32,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody has done Mega Man.

1291
01:59:32,764 --> 01:59:35,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just thought, okay, let's just run with that.

1292
01:59:37,347 --> 01:59:38,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought, this is perfect.

1293
01:59:39,048 --> 01:59:41,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Look what I found with a Google search on Reddit.

1294
01:59:41,389 --> 01:59:41,949
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?

1295
01:59:42,509 --> 01:59:42,990
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?

1296
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,065
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's VTuber is...

1297
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:37,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why VTuber makes it funnier I was also spelling taco yeah they do the live events in October typically what's been and in each year it's been less and less exciting because at first they showed off okay we're going to do the wild update and the wild update was supposed to be we're taking all the existing biomes in the game and we're going back and making them feel more full of life

1298
02:00:38,044 --> 02:00:54,133
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to be tweaking and they showed an example here's what we imagine the birch forest could look like and they had some concept art and then the update came out and it's like well where are all these biome changes that you said you're going to have because all you've included is you have one new swamp biome

1299
02:00:54,881 --> 02:00:57,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is cool, that's great, that's a new biome.

1300
02:00:57,502 --> 02:01:02,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one biome that was left over from the previous update that you just didn't have done at the time.

1301
02:01:02,444 --> 02:01:04,065
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that the wild update?

1302
02:01:04,105 --> 02:01:06,226
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't do the thing that you said that you were going to do.

1303
02:01:06,526 --> 02:01:10,428
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, well, that was just concept art, we never promised that we were going to do all these things.

1304
02:01:10,468 --> 02:01:13,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that was the whole point of calling it the wild update.

1305
02:01:13,749 --> 02:01:16,871
[SPEAKER_02]: You explained it, that this is what you were going to do, and you did none of it, so...

1306
02:01:17,851 --> 02:01:24,075
[SPEAKER_02]: and when you're wondering why people are upset and they're like, well, we're just never going to show you guys concept art anymore because you guys are just going to take it out.

1307
02:01:24,155 --> 02:01:25,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting it in the game.

1308
02:01:25,076 --> 02:01:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh my God.

1309
02:01:26,977 --> 02:01:29,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with the communication stuff, it's ridiculous.

1310
02:01:30,219 --> 02:01:36,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we get to our next story, I'm kind of curious what you think about this chat comment over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network as we are broadcasting live.

1311
02:01:37,424 --> 02:01:43,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Zenmonkey11 in chat says, just make Minecraft 2 and leave old Minecraft alone, please.

1312
02:01:43,587 --> 02:01:44,248
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll never do it.

1313
02:01:46,189 --> 02:01:53,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have thought Minecraft 2 would have happened a long time ago, but I think we get these spin-off games instead.

1314
02:01:54,560 --> 02:02:03,912
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be constantly supporting this one, because they're monetizing it on the Bedrock side, which is the majority of...

1315
02:02:05,491 --> 02:02:13,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the breakdown between Java and Bedrock is, but there's a lot of stuff being supported through Bedrock.

1316
02:02:13,238 --> 02:02:17,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of the marketplace stuff, those add-ons, that's big business for them.

1317
02:02:17,963 --> 02:02:19,224
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making lots of money.

1318
02:02:20,505 --> 02:02:23,588
[SPEAKER_02]: You could technically sell on their storefront as well.

1319
02:02:23,648 --> 02:02:24,850
[SPEAKER_02]: You could set up as a creator.

1320
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:25,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I've

1321
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:29,693
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our cast members does that sort of on the side as a few things.

1322
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:33,116
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out cosmetics on there and stuff.

1323
02:02:33,516 --> 02:02:34,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a big business for them.

1324
02:02:34,517 --> 02:02:39,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they're making the money to keep the game going because obviously they're not selling a ton of new copies.

1325
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:48,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't think they'll ever put out a Minecraft 2 because then they'll splinter their player base and...

1326
02:02:50,805 --> 02:02:51,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1327
02:02:51,826 --> 02:02:54,528
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have to stop supporting those older platforms and stuff.

1328
02:02:54,568 --> 02:02:56,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just kind of keep evolving the game as it is.

1329
02:02:57,691 --> 02:02:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see them doing that.

1330
02:02:59,332 --> 02:03:02,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would buy it, but I just don't see them doing that.

1331
02:03:02,275 --> 02:03:06,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Jason in chat says, there's no such thing as a sequel in a live service game.

1332
02:03:07,459 --> 02:03:10,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Diablo says hello, but I get your point.

1333
02:03:10,544 --> 02:03:11,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

1334
02:03:11,966 --> 02:03:21,920
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a time and place where I sort of thought Minecraft 2 was an inevitability when Microsoft came in and bought it, but I think we kind of got the spinoff games instead, and it's just more about refining...

1335
02:03:24,723 --> 02:03:27,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm bringing new people into this existing game.

1336
02:03:27,845 --> 02:03:30,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And the movie is going to be an interesting effect on that.

1337
02:03:30,107 --> 02:03:32,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I also think the movie is going to be kind of a non-starter.

1338
02:03:32,849 --> 02:03:34,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't think it's going to be very good.

1339
02:03:34,330 --> 02:03:34,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

1340
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:37,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say with the movie.

1341
02:03:37,031 --> 02:03:37,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

1342
02:03:39,212 --> 02:03:39,572
[SPEAKER_02]: FPMobile

1343
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I could... I don't know.

1344
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:07,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see them doing a sequel.

1345
02:04:07,311 --> 02:04:10,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be a tough sell, I think, to get a lot of people there.

1346
02:04:10,071 --> 02:04:16,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you would be... You have all those, like, bedrock players that are playing, like, the older versions and stuff.

1347
02:04:17,193 --> 02:04:19,854
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you sell that content to them?

1348
02:04:19,894 --> 02:04:25,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more profitable to, like... What they've done in the last few updates is they've tweaked all of the back...

1349
02:04:26,215 --> 02:04:48,491
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like to make everything component based now the way that the data is set up and it's supposed to make it easier for like map makers and mod developer add-on developers and stuff for on the bedrock side because they sell add-ons it's it's essentially selling mods um there's usually you buy maps or you can get add-ons that do different things um

1350
02:04:49,674 --> 02:04:53,700
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they're kind of working it towards that because that's what's going to bring them in the money.

1351
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:58,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Like doing a sequel, yeah, they would get those initial sales right off the bat, but they'd be in the same boat that they're in now.

1352
02:04:59,247 --> 02:05:04,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus now they have to support two different sets of games and it's just, I don't know.

1353
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:05,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1354
02:05:05,436 --> 02:05:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they'll do it someday.

1355
02:05:07,608 --> 02:05:09,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more story for you all.

1356
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:13,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking about, you know, live service games, let's talk about an Ubisoft live service game.

1357
02:05:13,593 --> 02:05:14,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about The Crew.

1358
02:05:15,155 --> 02:05:27,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the original Crew is no more, but we have The Crew 2 that is still ongoing, which, by the way, it was brought to my attention in our Discord server this week over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, cheap plug.

1359
02:05:27,926 --> 02:05:33,652
[SPEAKER_09]: You can join us and chat throughout the week, such as the alert that came through that The Crew 2 was on sale for a dollar.

1360
02:05:34,232 --> 02:05:45,452
[SPEAKER_09]: and still is I believe for another week so if you want to pick up the crew too for one whole dollar you can do that right now I think that's on Steam somebody correct me if I'm wrong in chat but I think that was on Steam um

1361
02:05:46,946 --> 02:05:47,806
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1362
02:06:08,697 --> 02:06:18,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently, a tweet that went out from the official Crew account called AtTheCrewGames said, We heard your concerns about access to the Crew games.

1363
02:06:19,305 --> 02:06:24,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of the Crew 2 and the Crew Motor Fest.

1364
02:06:24,469 --> 02:06:29,392
[SPEAKER_09]: We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long-term access to both titles.

1365
02:06:29,852 --> 02:06:32,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned for more news in the next months.

1366
02:06:32,674 --> 02:06:37,678
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, please do not bring this back up to the British government because they're likely to fuck us up.

1367
02:06:38,398 --> 02:06:54,968
[SPEAKER_09]: on this but this is you know what I mean I don't like to say bullying works but in this case maybe it was necessary because now they're getting now the offline mode is getting happening um so that's that's cool that uh we're getting gonna get an offline mode and this game can essentially live forever

1368
02:06:55,308 --> 02:07:22,704
[SPEAKER_09]: which must mean they're also planning on pulling the plug on this game at some point at least on the crew too well if you want to find out for better or worse again it's only a dollar right now so you can check that out apparently that will be coming in the next few months when that comes out at least the good news is you can expect they're not going to pull the plug until that patch is ready to go so that is that is kind of neat yeah for a dollar I'll probably check it out too to be quite honest so we'll see what happens with that

1369
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:27,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with that, that is all the official stories we had slotted tonight.

1370
02:07:27,261 --> 02:07:30,583
[SPEAKER_09]: We will open up the green room on Discord if anybody wants to give us a call tonight.

1371
02:07:30,944 --> 02:07:36,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to visit our mailbag, though I don't think we got anything, but maybe I am wrong.

1372
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:44,975
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to email us, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place where you can send us an email every week.

1373
02:07:45,015 --> 02:07:48,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we don't have an email, but we do have somebody in the green room waiting to get on the air.

1374
02:07:48,778 --> 02:07:51,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go to Discord and say hello.

1375
02:07:51,661 --> 02:07:52,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1376
02:07:52,702 --> 02:07:53,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1377
02:07:53,593 --> 02:07:57,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Long time no see, or at least like two hours and 15 minutes and sporadically in chat.

1378
02:07:57,677 --> 02:08:00,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, it's so good to have you on tonight.

1379
02:08:00,179 --> 02:08:00,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hello.

1380
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:05,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being here, especially in light of the announcement we were talking about earlier tonight.

1381
02:08:06,265 --> 02:08:06,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean it.

1382
02:08:06,765 --> 02:08:09,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't be here without you, so I'm glad you can partake in tonight's episode.

1383
02:08:10,413 --> 02:08:11,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you start the show and...

1384
02:08:39,354 --> 02:08:40,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

1385
02:08:40,996 --> 02:08:47,426
[SPEAKER_10]: That is 100% legit and real and deserved and well broken down by your statements at the top of the show.

1386
02:08:47,766 --> 02:08:49,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, wild stuff.

1387
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:50,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Surprise!

1388
02:08:53,254 --> 02:08:53,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny?

1389
02:08:53,815 --> 02:08:54,256
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't even...

1390
02:08:55,678 --> 02:09:05,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So behind the scenes inside baseball, I had some other stuff going on today with the love horror events that I host here locally for some promo early stuff I was working on.

1391
02:09:06,149 --> 02:09:12,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I didn't get our show role, which is basically like, I don't want to say script, but it's basically like the outline that's like,

1392
02:09:12,755 --> 02:09:36,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's gonna talk about this Matt's gonna talk about this like that whole thing it's gonna show that in advance and I almost sent it to Jay or because I couldn't get that out until late I didn't send it to like 4 30 pacific tonight which is very late usually I have that out by one two o'clock and I was gonna text Jason and say because Jason needs that so he knows what to intro at the top of the show and I almost sent you a text that said hey Sherwell's gonna be late just talk about PS5 Pro or the Guinness World Record

1393
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:40,453
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I'd sent you that text, I would have ruined the whole thing.

1394
02:09:40,893 --> 02:09:42,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I just assumed you knew.

1395
02:09:44,156 --> 02:09:48,660
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I am aware that I am increasingly out of the loop.

1396
02:09:49,661 --> 02:09:58,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe due to age, maybe due to business, definitely due to not being in the mass media circle that everybody relies on for this kind of news.

1397
02:09:58,548 --> 02:10:00,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't blame you for that decision one bit.

1398
02:10:01,671 --> 02:10:03,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry I didn't get to tell you personally.

1399
02:10:03,473 --> 02:10:03,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1400
02:10:04,033 --> 02:10:05,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, hey, I took the news directly.

1401
02:10:05,534 --> 02:10:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy with that.

1402
02:10:06,434 --> 02:10:19,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think it's kind of sad that people don't talk to each other to, you know, interact and learn about their lives, you know, and just expect that it was read online or something.

1403
02:10:19,762 --> 02:10:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1404
02:10:20,182 --> 02:10:24,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, people send me, like, Facebook stuff all the time, and I don't do Facebook at all.

1405
02:10:24,965 --> 02:10:25,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1406
02:10:26,566 --> 02:10:30,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Even more inside baseball, Rob, you didn't mention this at all.

1407
02:10:30,108 --> 02:10:31,549
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw each other a month ago.

1408
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:33,631
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why?

1409
02:10:33,711 --> 02:10:36,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And you said it was in the works for longer than that, didn't you?

1410
02:10:36,253 --> 02:10:44,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, I knew about it in March or April, but if I didn't make it clear, I don't ever trust that these things are actually going to happen until they happen.

1411
02:10:44,482 --> 02:10:47,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right, because the book just printed and shipped.

1412
02:10:47,225 --> 02:10:47,986
[SPEAKER_09]: The book just dropped.

1413
02:10:48,006 --> 02:10:49,627
[SPEAKER_10]: It only officially became official.

1414
02:10:50,248 --> 02:11:14,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even order the book because I was like eh I mean even though I did see so what they did send me I don't know how much I'm allowed to say but oops they did send me like a little preview that showed the picture and then it showed it showed that there was text there but it didn't I couldn't read the text it was like gray it looks like um like old ass fucking page makers zoomed out where all you see is gray blocks so that they sent you a picture of the proof

1415
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:17,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they sent me a picture of the proof, I guess.

1416
02:11:18,109 --> 02:11:18,789
[SPEAKER_09]: But I couldn't see.

1417
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:20,251
[SPEAKER_09]: It was only that corner.

1418
02:11:20,331 --> 02:11:21,753
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't show anybody else.

1419
02:11:21,853 --> 02:11:22,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't see the other show.

1420
02:11:23,374 --> 02:11:27,319
[SPEAKER_09]: It just showed the corner with us in it because they were verifying.

1421
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:29,020
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, can you verify everybody's name?

1422
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:30,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did, and they still got it wrong.

1423
02:11:33,425 --> 02:11:37,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, that is why I never trust these things until they actually happen.

1424
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:53,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have very much taken to, as a, perhaps related to, but I think for its own reasons, because I'm also not in the social networking, posting, commenting reactionosphere,

1425
02:11:55,137 --> 02:12:01,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, like, I'll hear about things that are interesting basically just by headlines of trailers, directs, showcases, etc.

1426
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:08,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, I'll take away a few things that I'm interested in, but then I just wait until it exists.

1427
02:12:08,141 --> 02:12:10,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't care about what it is until it exists.

1428
02:12:10,742 --> 02:12:12,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about that stuff anymore.

1429
02:12:14,123 --> 02:12:14,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I take away...

1430
02:12:16,124 --> 02:12:44,118
[SPEAKER_10]: taking away the knowledge of what something could have been appeals to is is relevant and no knock against journalists news rumor people like no no knock to the people that do it I don't so I don't part I have chosen not to partake in the the thick of the media only rather than the actual product itself and I get it I get it anyway I know you didn't call in to talk about Guinness night but we had to talk about it but what did you want to talk to us about tonight Jason

1431
02:12:44,426 --> 02:12:51,469
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny, because that segued perfectly because that last point is basically the one that I'm going to repeat with other examples.

1432
02:12:52,950 --> 02:13:02,975
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the side in the intro for if you're not listening to it right now, you could go rewind and re-listen to the, is this what a politician feels like?

1433
02:13:03,455 --> 02:13:05,556
[SPEAKER_10]: That I spoke out of the side of my mouth in the intro.

1434
02:13:06,296 --> 02:13:09,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I have obviously used the intro as my own opinion.

1435
02:13:09,518 --> 02:13:11,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the butterfly meme?

1436
02:13:11,999 --> 02:13:13,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this politics?

1437
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:18,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Even more relevant given the day of the month that it currently is.

1438
02:13:18,362 --> 02:13:19,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get Pikachu's face in there.

1439
02:13:20,243 --> 02:13:21,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this politics?

1440
02:13:22,965 --> 02:13:29,489
[SPEAKER_10]: ShockedPikachu.jpg.gif.mp4 It's in addition, because like I...

1441
02:13:30,925 --> 02:13:36,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I backed Star Citizen to the tune of 200-something dollars in 2012.

1442
02:13:37,572 --> 02:13:44,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I have turned into the result of the person that I am now, I see people talking about it whenever there's new content updates.

1443
02:13:44,219 --> 02:13:45,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I see this, that, and the other.

1444
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:50,405
[SPEAKER_10]: My response or my internal voice says, call me when Squadron 42's out.

1445
02:13:50,465 --> 02:13:52,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a shit about anything else.

1446
02:13:52,507 --> 02:13:54,109
[SPEAKER_10]: MMOs, make your own adventure, no.

1447
02:13:54,769 --> 02:14:15,056
[SPEAKER_10]: not my thing I bought it for Squadron 42 tell me when that's out I want to play it because I very much am a story directed experience kind of thing as well but I don't like my brain for the other things that I believe in and aligned with even if I don't practice keep

1448
02:14:16,016 --> 02:14:17,196
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was talking about before.

1449
02:14:34,542 --> 02:14:38,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Phoenix Wright, the Ace Attorney preservation.

1450
02:14:38,684 --> 02:14:44,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't remember if they mentioned that specifically, but yeah, when you said it, it was like, oh, hey, even more relation to the things going on in my brain.

1451
02:14:44,828 --> 02:14:56,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I 100% believe in preservation, restoration, and everything, and it's kind of shitty to say that somebody needs to do the unpaid labor to enable it.

1452
02:14:57,225 --> 02:14:57,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1453
02:15:13,927 --> 02:15:15,148
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more.

1454
02:15:37,123 --> 02:15:38,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Landed With A Flop

1455
02:16:02,314 --> 02:16:11,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be preserved for some kind of reference to look back on, and that's harder to do in gaming.

1456
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:26,587
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I speak, when I choose to speak of the 20 seconds that I have to come up with a point, I'm going to make it pretty concise, and it's going to be with the context of, for me, this is my opinion for myself.

1457
02:16:26,927 --> 02:16:30,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been 100% digital only since 2010.

1458
02:16:33,104 --> 02:16:33,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1459
02:16:33,465 --> 02:16:33,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1460
02:16:33,765 --> 02:16:34,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1461
02:16:34,565 --> 02:16:34,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1462
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:54,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no way of using it.

1463
02:16:54,921 --> 02:16:55,901
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an exaggeration.

1464
02:16:56,002 --> 02:17:07,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a USB Blu-ray drive literally sitting right next to me, but my PC that I'm staring at, my laptop that I use on a daily basis, my car that I drive, none of those things have an optical media drive.

1465
02:17:07,427 --> 02:17:10,148
[SPEAKER_10]: That medium is dying.

1466
02:17:11,048 --> 02:17:32,561
[SPEAKER_10]: and yes, you're not part of the that medium is not part of the major market anymore so if you want it for any and every reason unfortunately some might say the minority the minority what the hell is the word I'm looking for the minority needs get to pay for it kind of a shitty thing to say but

1467
02:17:34,450 --> 02:18:00,804
[SPEAKER_10]: it is an accessory, it is an extra you have to buy one to use your PS5 library for the people that have already probably spent way more money on physical media you can actually get sales on physical media I don't know, that's where I see my influence of the gaming era right now is that physical media is an accessory and that means it costs too, like every other accessory

1468
02:18:01,164 --> 02:18:02,986
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1469
02:18:19,181 --> 02:18:43,503
[SPEAKER_09]: you know it kind of talked about that before was kind of like the equity of what that cartridge or that disc or whatever is still worth especially when we know we kind of talked about earlier in the show sometimes these collectible things are hot items like you know look what's look what's happening for conquered whether it's eye rolling or you know not you know suddenly these this physical medium the last way to actually have a piece of this game is suddenly like very popular even if we're kind of rolling our eyes at it or not you know so

1470
02:18:44,284 --> 02:19:00,440
[SPEAKER_09]: or it's as simple as being able to loan somebody a game or being able to sell it back and all this stuff but there's something to be said now in this day and age about the convenience because these games are so large about having the game just fired up up there on screen ready to go and

1471
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:17,581
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think what's most important and what's going to need to really continue to be important especially in the console space because it's already true in the gaming space if I, or in the PC space excuse me, if I upgrade my PC or whatever computer I'm using, if I upgrade my computer my Steam library carries with me and I can play everything on Steam on that new

1472
02:19:18,522 --> 02:19:19,243
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1473
02:19:42,404 --> 02:19:46,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there will, you know, and I know you kind of addressed it talking about like the minority.

1474
02:19:46,587 --> 02:19:59,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just like the fact that Target sells vinyl records now, I feel like there is always going to be a space for physical, but I understand that like, especially as the cloud and, you know...

1475
02:20:00,496 --> 02:20:04,817
[SPEAKER_09]: for better or for worse, AI computing on the fly, especially cloud-based.

1476
02:20:04,917 --> 02:20:09,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's where the industry is going, whether we like it or not, to get some of these higher-end graphics.

1477
02:20:09,719 --> 02:20:14,160
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll say cloud-based processing is going to kind of force more things to be digital.

1478
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:17,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I understand that.

1479
02:20:17,121 --> 02:20:24,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, there's that flip side I just talked about that I talked about earlier in the show that's always going to be in the back of people's minds.

1480
02:20:24,923 --> 02:20:28,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the corporate gremlins going to sneak into my house overnight and take my digital copy away from me?

1481
02:20:30,353 --> 02:20:52,496
[SPEAKER_10]: removal like PT being the obviously like stand out significant what the fuck scenario is the extreme example and hundreds of them happen year over year because of ties because of server side ties that don't need to be a thing but they were designed to be that way

1482
02:20:54,421 --> 02:21:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw does point out, and he's not wrong, that one of the main reasons things are going digital is that physical media doesn't last forever.

1483
02:21:00,883 --> 02:21:02,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to eventually break down.

1484
02:21:03,324 --> 02:21:04,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially the older games.

1485
02:21:05,505 --> 02:21:08,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Back when they were cartridges, that shit was built to last.

1486
02:21:08,566 --> 02:21:15,009
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you really think that these companies are going to be saving their games on their servers once they get old?

1487
02:21:15,049 --> 02:21:20,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll be lucky to have some source code that might be preserved that's not available for public consumption.

1488
02:21:20,871 --> 02:21:21,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1489
02:21:22,032 --> 02:21:27,256
[SPEAKER_10]: On one hand, to that end, on one hand, the Giga leak went back decades.

1490
02:21:28,317 --> 02:21:35,763
[SPEAKER_10]: On the other hand, Square, or whomever is most responsible, lost, had to rebuild Kingdom Hearts entirely.

1491
02:21:35,843 --> 02:21:43,469
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like, yes, if people, if companies are mindful enough to do it, but no, because accidents happen and things go wrong.

1492
02:21:43,489 --> 02:21:44,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1493
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:56,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and on the server front, there's also the could there possibly in our lifetime in the next few years be regulation that regulates some sort of longevity to these online games?

1494
02:21:56,834 --> 02:22:01,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll tell you what, that whole Ubisoft story we just covered is them running in fear of that.

1495
02:22:03,592 --> 02:22:14,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and again, to the same extent, I am 100% in support of legislation to keep things working that go in people's hands.

1496
02:22:15,039 --> 02:22:26,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Stadia, Stadia refunding all of the game license fees and ultimately keeping all the subscription fees was a huge positive deal for consumers.

1497
02:22:28,067 --> 02:22:31,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I got refunded for my Founders Kit, my controller and Chromecast.

1498
02:22:32,049 --> 02:22:33,491
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura has some thoughts on that.

1499
02:22:34,533 --> 02:22:49,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, and all of that money that got me first class back and forth to Alabama when my mom was in the hospital and then having to redo all of my freaking Dead by Daylight achievements and having to, after three months, rebuy all my DLC.

1500
02:22:51,245 --> 02:23:19,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I think and it's one of the being a little bit more business minded now and less blanket anarchist which is a very weird situation to find myself in mentally like I do believe that a well run company is going to continuously plan for the exit I don't know how many do I don't know if any of the companies I've ever worked with plan for the exit that's only a thing as far as I know that's only a thing legislatively and like

1501
02:23:19,746 --> 02:23:24,849
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the BP cleanup related story is kind of the only thing I can remember in that world.

1502
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:43,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I think companies, when they have released media, released product, like stake in people's hands, it needs to be able to be allowed to be, it needs to be made to be permanent because it's not yours anymore when it's in other people's hands.

1503
02:23:43,918 --> 02:23:45,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You are making something for people.

1504
02:23:45,919 --> 02:23:48,121
[SPEAKER_09]: That is such a fascinating point you just brought up.

1505
02:23:48,161 --> 02:23:50,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just kind of want to highlight that.

1506
02:23:50,163 --> 02:23:54,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Plan for the exit is something that we don't really see gaming companies do.

1507
02:23:54,727 --> 02:23:56,869
[SPEAKER_09]: But when they do it, it's almost infamous.

1508
02:23:56,929 --> 02:24:00,472
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost the things of legend that buys a lot of trust.

1509
02:24:00,612 --> 02:24:02,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And my case in point is Valve.

1510
02:24:02,734 --> 02:24:07,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the most popular and well-known in the industry plan for the exit is the Steam button.

1511
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:10,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody knows that Steam has a button.

1512
02:24:11,081 --> 02:24:20,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And if Valve ever closes their doors, what that button's going to do is it's going to open up all of the games you own on Steam to be DRM free and no longer require Steam.

1513
02:24:20,768 --> 02:24:23,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fascinated by hearing about that.

1514
02:24:24,051 --> 02:24:26,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember reading that article however many years ago.

1515
02:24:26,712 --> 02:24:28,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fascinated by that and want to know more.

1516
02:24:29,074 --> 02:24:36,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody might know, but they're not going to blast the EMP to do absolutely crazy things.

1517
02:24:36,122 --> 02:24:37,743
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that is a great example.

1518
02:24:38,204 --> 02:24:46,733
[SPEAKER_10]: That has come up in conversation for a company that has been the dominant PC distributor for 20 years now?

1519
02:24:46,753 --> 02:24:46,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

1520
02:24:47,333 --> 02:25:02,988
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is, I think, a mentality that goes with just about any business that people don't, and maybe it's a point of too much pride or what have you, but they don't think that their business isn't going to outlive them.

1521
02:25:03,328 --> 02:25:03,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, absolutely.

1522
02:25:04,289 --> 02:25:06,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is going to be forever.

1523
02:25:06,271 --> 02:25:07,352
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't possibly fail.

1524
02:25:07,392 --> 02:25:08,053
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in the lead.

1525
02:25:09,107 --> 02:25:10,389
[SPEAKER_10]: We're making money hand over fist.

1526
02:25:10,409 --> 02:25:12,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Why plan for something that isn't going to happen?

1527
02:25:12,612 --> 02:25:16,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as the saying goes, gravity works.

1528
02:25:19,935 --> 02:25:23,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I prefer the version that's Gravity Sucks, which is said in jest, of course.

1529
02:25:23,457 --> 02:25:24,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I prefer the ban.

1530
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:25,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Gravity kills.

1531
02:25:26,419 --> 02:25:27,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Must come down.

1532
02:25:28,901 --> 02:25:30,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, good shit, as always.

1533
02:25:30,923 --> 02:25:33,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate your perspective on this show.

1534
02:25:33,644 --> 02:25:34,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for calling in.

1535
02:25:34,525 --> 02:25:42,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you for everything you do to keep OLR a record-running podcast at this point.

1536
02:25:43,371 --> 02:25:44,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Round of applause to all of us!

1537
02:25:44,772 --> 02:25:48,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Round of applause every chat!

1538
02:25:48,974 --> 02:25:50,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Jason, thanks a bunch.

1539
02:25:50,474 --> 02:25:51,194
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk to you next time.

1540
02:25:51,995 --> 02:25:52,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Hear us in two weeks.

1541
02:25:53,235 --> 02:25:53,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, two weeks.

1542
02:25:54,076 --> 02:25:54,376
[SPEAKER_09]: See you then.

1543
02:25:56,397 --> 02:25:57,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thanks Jason for that.

1544
02:25:57,677 --> 02:25:58,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate that.

1545
02:25:59,078 --> 02:26:02,760
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, I think we are ready to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.

1546
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:05,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for everybody for listening.

1547
02:26:05,921 --> 02:26:09,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I realized I need to check in with Loki for any last minute stories.

1548
02:26:09,202 --> 02:26:10,363
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have had kind of a

1549
02:26:11,854 --> 02:26:13,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Visier week than usual.

1550
02:26:15,458 --> 02:26:25,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... Yeah, the last minute story, so I don't know what this is gonna be, but so I decided, um, when we were talking about, like, um...

1551
02:26:26,966 --> 02:26:31,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we were talking about like publishing and stuff like that with Annapurna Interactive and stuff like that.

1552
02:26:32,028 --> 02:26:35,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it reminded me, oh yeah, I should probably check my HIO to see if I have sold anything.

1553
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:39,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, you know, because no one's purchased it.

1554
02:26:39,432 --> 02:26:43,874
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I have a note or a comment.

1555
02:26:44,654 --> 02:26:49,358
[SPEAKER_02]: from 72 days ago, because I, once again, I don't check my account very often.

1556
02:26:50,059 --> 02:26:53,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, I discovered and played this tonight.

1557
02:26:53,422 --> 02:26:55,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in with low expectations, but this is brilliant.

1558
02:26:55,563 --> 02:26:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we get in touch?

1559
02:26:56,865 --> 02:26:59,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to publish a physical version of the game for you.

1560
02:26:59,647 --> 02:27:04,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a company called, it's ITGsoft out of Taiwan.

1561
02:27:05,552 --> 02:27:31,044
[SPEAKER_09]: well look into it and make sure it's legit because I could also see that you know and I do not know this company so this is not shade it's just reality make sure it's legit and not a scamming thing because you know but of course if it is legit then fucking good for you and how fucking funny that you I almost missed the Guinness thing because I don't fucking read Twitter and you did miss this because you don't read Twitch.io laughing

1562
02:27:32,169 --> 02:27:33,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1563
02:27:33,410 --> 02:27:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we'll see.

1564
02:27:36,951 --> 02:27:43,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that there's, like, some other folks that have worked with them in the community, so I just said, hey, what's going on?

1565
02:27:44,154 --> 02:27:44,715
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

1566
02:27:44,815 --> 02:27:46,655
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, is this legit or not?

1567
02:27:47,156 --> 02:27:54,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to publish to Retroverse, but they're not up and ready to go, and I don't know how long it's going to take them to do that.

1568
02:27:54,399 --> 02:27:55,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want to see you on Evercade.

1569
02:27:55,759 --> 02:27:57,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want to see you on Evercade.

1570
02:27:57,140 --> 02:27:57,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be cool.

1571
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:58,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's ever going to happen.

1572
02:27:59,321 --> 02:27:59,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1573
02:28:00,414 --> 02:28:03,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think I have to reach out to them, though, to do that.

1574
02:28:03,655 --> 02:28:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

1575
02:28:04,095 --> 02:28:04,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

1576
02:28:04,495 --> 02:28:04,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I can ask.

1577
02:28:05,856 --> 02:28:07,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you make another NES game someday.

1578
02:28:07,476 --> 02:28:07,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do.

1579
02:28:07,977 --> 02:28:08,257
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1580
02:28:08,617 --> 02:28:09,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a lot of work.

1581
02:28:09,417 --> 02:28:13,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It's easy for me to sit here and say, go ye to work, Loki, and make me a game.

1582
02:28:13,879 --> 02:28:15,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a lot of work.

1583
02:28:15,719 --> 02:28:17,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I want to respect that, too.

1584
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:24,082
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm glad somebody's fucking giving you the kudos you deserve.

1585
02:28:25,148 --> 02:28:25,948
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1586
02:28:41,517 --> 02:28:43,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight.

1587
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:44,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, thank you.

1588
02:28:44,941 --> 02:28:48,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, can't say it enough tonight, especially in light of the big news this week.

1589
02:28:48,606 --> 02:28:54,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for all the support you've given us over the years, whether this was your first week or your 1017th week.

1590
02:28:54,853 --> 02:28:55,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being here.

1591
02:28:56,055 --> 02:28:56,916
[SPEAKER_09]: It really means the world.

1592
02:28:57,216 --> 02:29:00,038
[SPEAKER_09]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

1593
02:29:00,098 --> 02:29:04,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1594
02:29:05,721 --> 02:29:13,846
[SPEAKER_09]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show, go an awful long way, and we appreciate them all.

1595
02:29:14,287 --> 02:29:17,529
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, we're going to go around and get some final thoughts.

1596
02:29:18,349 --> 02:29:19,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun at TwitchCon, gang.

1597
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:22,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really sorry I can't be there, but I think you guys are going to have a great time.

1598
02:29:23,372 --> 02:29:24,893
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, I know you're streaming tonight.

1599
02:29:24,993 --> 02:29:25,974
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a final thought for us.

1600
02:29:27,148 --> 02:29:27,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights out.

1601
02:29:28,729 --> 02:29:29,309
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, have fun.

1602
02:29:30,169 --> 02:29:31,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will have a Shayla with me.

1603
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:32,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good.

1604
02:29:34,732 --> 02:29:35,672
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll see you all soon.

1605
02:29:35,712 --> 02:29:37,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try to lurk after I get the podcast up.

1606
02:29:38,593 --> 02:29:39,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Lurk and twerk.

1607
02:29:39,414 --> 02:29:41,695
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I will, except I won't be sharing the twerking.

1608
02:29:41,755 --> 02:29:42,035
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1609
02:29:43,256 --> 02:29:43,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1610
02:29:43,736 --> 02:29:43,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1611
02:29:44,796 --> 02:29:45,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how about you?

1612
02:29:45,997 --> 02:29:46,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thought for us tonight?

1613
02:29:48,278 --> 02:29:50,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Big week this week, so look forward to it.

1614
02:29:52,806 --> 02:30:00,271
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I'm looking forward to my little trip to Seattle and the Ingress competition that's happening up there.

1615
02:30:00,391 --> 02:30:09,377
[SPEAKER_09]: But even if we were to lose it horrifically, which we won't, but you never know, I'm still just excited to go to Seattle and see my buddies up there, to be honest.

1616
02:30:09,737 --> 02:30:11,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be a fun personal trip for me.

1617
02:30:12,299 --> 02:30:13,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun, everybody who's going to TwitchCon.

1618
02:30:13,679 --> 02:30:16,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to miss it this year, but Alan and I will try to get back there next year.

1619
02:30:18,443 --> 02:30:19,403
[SPEAKER_09]: We just needed a year off.

1620
02:30:19,583 --> 02:30:21,505
[SPEAKER_09]: After all the walking in Vegas last year,

1621
02:30:22,265 --> 02:30:26,746
[SPEAKER_09]: and the near panic attack I had on the monorail in Vegas, we needed a year off.

1622
02:30:26,826 --> 02:30:29,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad they moved it back to San Diego and holy fuck, I hope they keep it there.

1623
02:30:31,647 --> 02:30:32,707
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

1624
02:30:32,827 --> 02:30:33,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good.

1625
02:30:33,587 --> 02:30:38,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the precautions yesterday to get my shots so that I don't bring home con crud.

1626
02:30:38,768 --> 02:30:40,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, you know, for you.

1627
02:30:40,168 --> 02:30:41,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I hope you don't get convid.

1628
02:30:42,249 --> 02:30:43,449
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's no fun at all.

1629
02:30:43,529 --> 02:30:45,429
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, good for you taking those precautions.

1630
02:30:45,829 --> 02:30:47,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I can't get it for three months.

1631
02:30:48,570 --> 02:30:51,774
[SPEAKER_09]: because you don't get the shot after you've had a positive COVID case.

1632
02:30:51,794 --> 02:30:56,198
[SPEAKER_09]: But the silver lining is that I'll get it just in time for the cruise next year.

1633
02:30:56,519 --> 02:30:58,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you don't do that?

1634
02:30:58,281 --> 02:30:58,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

1635
02:31:00,043 --> 02:31:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not supposed to have the shot if you already had COVID within the past three months.

1636
02:31:04,588 --> 02:31:04,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

1637
02:31:07,774 --> 02:31:09,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah, wah, wah.

1638
02:31:09,795 --> 02:31:10,155
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1639
02:31:11,015 --> 02:31:11,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1640
02:31:11,496 --> 02:31:13,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's a downside to it.

1641
02:31:13,416 --> 02:31:19,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, I don't know if it's like less effective or I think maybe the thought process is you don't need it because you already have the immunity.

1642
02:31:19,559 --> 02:31:20,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

1643
02:31:22,768 --> 02:31:23,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask your doctor.

1644
02:31:23,629 --> 02:31:24,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a fucking doctor.

1645
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:26,551
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to end on that note tonight.

1646
02:31:26,891 --> 02:31:27,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a fucking doctor.

1647
02:31:28,011 --> 02:31:29,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll see you in two weeks.

1648
02:31:30,313 --> 02:31:32,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great two weeks, everybody.

1649
02:31:32,394 --> 02:31:33,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time.

1650
02:31:33,495 --> 02:31:35,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun with Bobby Blackwolf Live next week.

1651
02:31:35,796 --> 02:31:36,636
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time.

1652
02:31:37,037 --> 02:31:37,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy TwitchCon.

1653
02:31:38,758 --> 02:31:39,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.
