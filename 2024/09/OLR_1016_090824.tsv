9622	10543	I don't watch a lot of movies.
10643	11223	I don't avoid them.
11263	12424	I just end up not seeing them.
12664	23630	Despite that, I feel like I've been continually aware of Jack Black's roles, as far back as his supporting role in Enemy of the State, to his back-to-back-to-back roles in video game movies that you, and even those that aren't in gaming culture, probably know at least two of the three.
23870	27132	I guess I just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Jack Black's effort, and his beard.
27472	29053	This is the Rose-Tinted Glasses intro.
29273	33935	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about why Jack Black is relevant to gaming news.
34316	36497	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39386	41847	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41888	47291	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47451	59718	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back tonight, September the 8th of 2024 with episode number 1016 of our show.
59838	67863	We are back after a week off for the Labor Day holiday, and I was at Dragon Con, and I'm sure my co-hosts were up to no good as well.
68223	68483	DarkSakura
88383	92486	I am the best and full of energy and perky!
92766	94307	I'm glad to hear it, me too!
95247	96828	Yay, us!
97589	100110	Which is also a lie, but I'll get through tonight.
100431	104533	Well, okay, in all seriousness, I hope you feel better.
105154	105774	Thank you.
105914	107395	I'm also not feeling great.
107575	111658	I caught Convid, Conronavirus, what have you.
112358	115020	Which, you know, a lot of people are going to be like, you idiot.
115834	119055	That's what happens when you go to a big convention with a lot of people is you're going to be exposed to that.
119095	120215	My answer is, I know.
120555	132197	I know it's a risk, but the reality is my mental health after coming out of that convention, holy shit, I had an incredible, amazing, wonderful year.
132397	138438	Yeah, it sucks that I got the big C, but you'll notice my symptoms are in pretty good shape.
138458	139998	You left with 19 crows, you know, COVID-19.
140018	140618	That's right, COVID-19.
144039	146100	It's really only the fatigue at this point.
146900	148400	E3VL is asking, were you bedridden?
148461	149021	Not really.
149201	153202	I don't want to minimize it because I know it's worse for other people.
153402	157203	And disclaimer, I had Paxilvid, and Paxilvid started to act really fast.
158104	160464	So it was really just like sniffles, sore throat, the flu.
162865	171608	I know ironically in the beginning we weren't supposed to say it was just a flu, but with drugs and stuff and this far into things, it was very reminiscent of the flu.
172148	174369	Just this nasty fatigue thing going on.
174729	176689	And yeah, it's the weird thing about it.
177469	178590	Alan did not get sick.
179010	180330	Bobby did not get sick.
180710	183351	Somebody else we were hanging out with the entire time got sick.
184511	186272	But just kind of looking at the various discords.
186312	187872	I'm in a discord for digital media.
188172	190053	I'm in a discord for video games.
190553	193074	Like, overall, again, I'm not trying to minimize the risk.
193154	200257	I'm just saying, as I see on the stats, yeah, it's way less people than got it at 2022 and 2023.
200877	204958	So I'm just lucky, yay, that I got it.
204978	209740	Because I would say it's less than five in both of those servers.
209800	213461	Again, that's one small sampling of a much bigger population.
213541	215242	And I'm sure there's other people...
218092	234357	Get your shots, take precautions, do what you need to do But I'm just saying, it does seem like it's not quite the effect it was a couple years ago My friend Annie came back with it from Stuff Mom Never Told You Oh, was she at DragonCon too?
235137	243160	Yeah, she was Disco Luke Oh, how fun As in a specific German interview Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
244088	245970	and the sequined Luke Skywalker.
247591	247872	So, yeah.
248032	248672	That's fun.
248873	250314	Oh, I wish I'd seen them.
250394	253577	I don't know if she brought Winter Soldier this year.
253657	256119	I didn't ask, but I know Disco Luke was the big one.
257360	259582	SSJ100Matt says, there's been a COVID surge lately.
259662	259863	Yes.
260023	262745	So even if you didn't go, you could have gotten in at the store for 15 minutes.
262765	264247	So enjoy your life to the fullest.
264367	265588	That's where my brain is at.
265708	266289	Absolutely.
266389	267149	You know, it's just...
267870	268350	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
288661	289522	I don't know.
289562	291464	Peachy Keen Jellybean, to quote one of my friends.
291704	292325	Okay, I like that.
292345	294487	Did you have a good Labor Day weekend?
294647	295107	Long weekend?
295288	299792	Did you get a chance to work on more Minecraft videos?
300473	301353	Yeah, I think so.
302094	304056	I don't remember when I put up the last one.
304376	305938	Was that the week before?
306038	306538	I don't remember.
306558	307539	The time is...
308407	309867	Yeah, we're kicking no one down.
309907	310027	Yeah.
339136	345139	No, it's more footage from the game than I ever wish to play.
345279	346559	The game that you will never play.
347520	349721	Well, yeah, I don't know if they're ever going to bring it back.
349921	351341	We'll get into that in a little bit.
351421	354543	But I could see them retooling it and re-releasing it.
356687	360068	Yeah, it was, let's see, yeah, so it would have launched, it was on the 23rd that it launched.
360108	360208	Okay.
381315	384917	because I think we talked about it's really pitiful numbers that it had.
385378	386158	Oh, yes, we did.
386258	386578	We did.
386638	389820	We talked about that on Steam, but we didn't know how it was performing on PlayStation.
389880	390481	That was the whole thing.
390501	391481	Apparently not well.
391942	392222	Whoops.
392662	396965	So, yeah, so apparently it wasn't doing well.
397245	397685	It peaked.
397765	405090	It was around like 700 or so players on Steam and then only went down from there.
405670	414794	and so Sony and I guess Firewalk, I'm going to say it's more on the Sony side, decided that they're going to pull it offline.
415675	422298	They took it down on September 6th and essentially refunded everybody for the game.
422438	423499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
441797	466772	you know we've seen games that get taken down after a year like Babylon's Fall or something but they don't they don't get refunded because at least they were up for a year or whatever but two weeks that that would be a hard one if there were to be a class action or something behind that it is probably the shortest amount of time for a AAA game not the shortest amount of time ever though for a live service game because that was that scam game that was I think earlier this year last year so there was that one but
467492	471235	Well, then there was Cyberpunk, but they also didn't refund that.
471975	474597	And they always had the intention to bring that back.
474957	477079	We're pulling it to address critical things.
477099	478440	It was kind of a different circumstance.
478560	482583	Yeah, that was only on the PlayStation platform, so it wasn't on every platform.
483283	485125	The other one you're talking about was something, too.
485145	489548	It was a sequel, but it was like... I know what you're talking about.
489948	492470	It wasn't a sequel, or maybe it was.
492530	492870	Who cares?
492930	493631	It was a scam.
494511	496553	The whole thing was a scam, essentially.
498027	505945	Good point by Tigerclaw in chat as well is that the PC version of Cyberpunk was not affected in all of that mess.
506265	507728	It was only the console stuff.
509516	524511	So, according to a blog post that they had on, so a few days before they pulled the servers, they shared on their blog that, you know, Concord fans, we've been listening to you closely and to your feedback since launch of the Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC.
524872	531258	Yeah, too bad you didn't listen to us beforehand when we said that this was a terrible idea and it was going to bomb really hard, but...
533425	534946	You try it anyways.
535467	540370	Without sounding like, you know, every other cynical gamer out there, can we take a deep dive?
540451	541111	Let's refresh.
541491	541792	Why?
542232	543993	Why were we warning them it was going to bomb?
544754	545474	So a few things.
545875	550078	One, price point was a factor.
550158	560286	So it was competing against games that essentially are free to play, but it was charging a $40 price point and still monetizing like a free to play game.
560586	560986	FOMESTARS
581346	581606	Yeah.
581646	581827	Yeah.
581847	581967	Yeah.
605469	622121	it's fine you know and that game probably could have done a lot better if the AI thing hadn't been sandbagging it because I'm telling you that turned a lot of people off from the game and that's going to continue to turn people off I guarantee it people but anyway that's that's another Concord didn't have the AI problem so yeah Concord didn't
622741	624083	Didn't have the AI problem.
624924	637018	Just the whole draw that they were marketing it as is supposed to have interesting characters, which, to be fair, the characters felt like a knockoff of Guardians of the Galaxy.
637458	640199	Like, it just felt like a knockoff of it.
640839	644560	And so right then, you didn't have people that were interested in these characters.
644600	652362	They weren't interested in these lore, storyline, cinematics that you said that you were going to produce every single week.
654242	662005	The gameplay itself was alright, because it did have veteran developers from other games like Destiny and stuff working on that.
662705	666066	The problem was... Yeah, this doesn't look like I'm watching it being played behind you here.
666446	666826	Oh, yeah?
666846	667186	DarkSakura?
668093	687126	nothing I thought Matt still was saying something I'm sorry I have one more thing yeah so the problem was though they also had some weird like gameplay um mechanics in there as well so like for example they would have it where you couldn't play the same character over and over in certain game types which is kind of weird um
688660	689120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
712402	740864	it's competing against Overwatch but Overwatch has interesting characters with interesting abilities whereas these characters aren't interesting and their abilities are kind of weird they're not necessarily interesting either and so that was kind of the uphill battle that they were facing and yeah I mean I think it should have been looked at a little bit closer they probably didn't think that it was going to bomb this hard though obviously if they pushed it forward
741175	746960	I was going to mention a minute ago, watching the gameplay behind you, this doesn't look particularly bad.
747320	750202	It looks like the graphics are kind of nice and it looks very fluid.
750723	757148	I'm going to chop up this kind of choppy frame rate I see to more what we're getting over Discord and the relay than the game itself.
757188	758189	Probably runs a pretty smooth 60.
759170	764875	But what I notice about it is that I've seen this game a lot of times.
765535	772619	and that's a big part of the problem when you're asking $40 for it is that it does look pretty generic.
772659	773219	I hate to say it.
773619	776761	And you know what else I think is a really like...
777913	779593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
802836	809443	What is the number one reason, if you know, what is the number one reason people dislike Overwatch 2 versus Overwatch 1?
810124	815669	What is the number one thing they changed from Overwatch 1 to Overwatch 2 people don't like?
816430	821495	So much so that they're looking at doing like an experimental mode to bring this back into Overwatch 2.
822366	825247	Was it the 5v5 versus 4v4?
825307	825808	Ding, ding, ding.
825848	827889	It's 5v5 versus 6v6.
828209	828829	That's what it is.
830050	831150	Fair enough, E3VL.
831190	836252	There are other reasons too, but I see as far as the game mechanics, because E3VL mentions Battle Pass.
836613	839054	That's fair, because it transitions to free-to-play and so forth.
839514	843136	But the fact that they went from 6v6 to 5v5.
843716	850099	So why, if you're listening to what the community doesn't like about your competitors...
851019	859766	Why do you then release a 5v5 shooter when that's the thing that people don't like about Overwatch 2 versus the original Overwatch?
860326	866171	If they had made it a 6v6 shooter and they could have had a whole campaign around, come on back to 6v6 play.
866511	869373	Come on back to the most entertaining 6v6 game on the market.
869674	870514	You know, or things like that.
870554	871975	That's a stretch.
872015	873396	But still, you know what I'm getting at, right?
873457	878601	It just feels very like they really just didn't do the work
879341	888444	to see, and the programmers did their job, the graphic people did their job, the artists did their job, but the people who designed it didn't really do their job, in my opinion.
888464	890805	I mean, look at the level designs, like, they're very plain.
890845	899288	They're supposed to be going to all these different planets, but they all look like some industrial corridor shooter thing, which is kind of annoying.
900149	908972	The other thing, but yeah, like, even from the outset, when they announced it, the announcement trailer with the cinematic, which is supposed to get you hyped about it, people are just like, eh.
909804	910866	Nah, I'm good.
911687	913950	It wasn't very exciting.
913990	926927	I could say a good example of a game like this that did have, I think, the hype behind it just because of the trailer and what they showed gameplay-wise would have been... Oh gosh, I just had it in an...
928752	930773	The Finals was a good one.
931193	933775	Like, that one, like, I got excited about that game.
934195	935356	I don't want to play it, but I got it.
935676	937477	It was an exciting trailer.
937557	938958	Like, wow, that looks really cool.
939238	944841	Like, when I saw the cinematics for this, I'm like, wow, no, I don't want to play this.
944941	948203	I'll play Guardians of the Galaxy instead, but I don't want to play this.
948323	949844	I don't want to play this type of thing.
949904	957849	Now, if this was like a Guardians of the Galaxy game, where they're like, you know, like an arena shooter like that, that...
958615	984257	could be cool ironically Loki Mike Deft in chat mentions we have something like Marvel Rivals which would be close enough to what you're talking about coming later in the year and that game got quite the reception on their latest beta absolutely a lot of streamer pals were streaming that Marvel Rivals beta those that could get into it doesn't bode well for all that talk of you can never seem to launch something that doesn't tie in as a sequel or something with an existing IP but
985017	987179	Um, but it is what it is, right?
987259	993122	That's, that's why Marvel Rivals is kind of getting attention too, is that it's, you know, Overwatch, but Marvel.
994483	999946	So, um, as Joe and Hunter Matt also says, they also developed this for eight years.
1000346	1004889	Back when they started Overwatch was the hot game when shooters weren't as prevalent.
1005269	1007430	Now 5v5 hero shooters are all over the place.
1007891	1010072	Such a long dev cycle hurt this thing.
1010752	1018575	Quest Buster in chat says, I'll be honest, when I first saw the reveal trailer, I was kind of excited for what I thought was going to be a looter shooter with a Guardians-like vibe.
1018635	1022216	And then when they said 5v5 team shooter, I lost all interest.
1022276	1029239	Maybe once again, people kind of wanting a PvE element or something else in it, not getting it and deciding to do a pass.
1030179	1035761	E3VL brings up an interesting game that launched recently that's doing much different than this.
1036481	1037962	E3VL mentions Deadlock.
1038502	1039403	Deadlock Deadlock Deadlock
1060419	1064762	Technically, Deadlock is a little more MOBA vibe into it.
1064863	1071408	I don't think you can quite call it Overwatch, but there's definitely like Overwatch meets Dota.
1071728	1074650	You know, it's very, you know, kind of that whole thing is what that game is.
1075351	1080314	But again, maybe it's just the fact that, oh my God, Valve is doing a game because...
1081275	1104331	the characters in Deadlock are original characters you know and they're fine they're cool they're Valve characters it's just but it's but there's so many more people that care about Deadlock versus this game it's just interesting right but Deadlock's also free so so yeah that's the thing like a free play like I don't think this would have been a big deal if it was well first off you'd have more people playing it
1105394	1106495	if it was free to play.
1107436	1109658	I think it's just the $40 price point.
1109978	1113221	You buy into it, and it's like, oh, there's no one playing.
1113461	1120747	They should have known, though, because they had 25,000 sales from that, or even pre-orders.
1120947	1123249	They had very few pre-orders for this game.
1123969	1126711	So it's like, don't you see the writing on the wall?
1126731	1127032	Maybe delay it?
1127052	1128072	Delay a bit, and
1132503	1133164	I don't know.
1133184	1134605	Maybe they were hopeful that it would do better.
1134705	1137088	I think the $40 was the problem.
1137248	1138029	I think it was the biggest problem.
1149941	1159672	The article that should come out is that vice presidents and above at this studio were all let go this week, and the staff under them were transferred to XYZ Studio under Sony.
1160633	1162335	And this studio is no more.
1162375	1164097	That's the story I would want to see.
1164498	1166740	If the studio is going to close, that's not going to be – we all know.
1166880	1167901	We all know that's not the reality.
1168542	1177332	So if the studio doesn't close next week, I would assume that this game will be relaunched as a PlayStation Plus free thing.
1177752	1184079	And they're going to look at a different way to try to monetize it, which hopefully is a little better than what they tried.
1184920	1186982	Do not pay for those discs.
1188003	1192224	I mean, because people are saying, oh, this is a hot collector item, you'll never be able to play this game, da-da-da.
1194324	1196325	I don't think Sony writes this off completely.
1196405	1202586	I think it does come back, and essentially all those discs are going to do are ping the server to download the new game now.
1202646	1209647	It's not, you know, I guess you could always have an offline copy of it, but it doesn't do you much good when it's an offline game.
1209867	1211848	Yeah, I was going to say, technically, I don't think it does anything.
1211868	1214008	Can't play the game offline.
1214708	1221289	I don't think those discs are really worth much, so you can go track one down if you want, but yeah, I don't know about that.
1222330	1225690	Phila9 says they should add a Glenn Close cosmetic.
1225810	1226970	Boom, game fixed.
1227451	1233652	You know, you joke, but maybe it's all they have to do is put a Sony character in it.
1234352	1235672	Put Kratos in space.
1235892	1236252	I don't know.
1236692	1237473	The problem is this.
1238153	1239933	Aloy in space.
1240613	1241913	Do they have character?
1242094	1243694	Astro Bot with guns.
1245295	1260690	yeah it's I mean talk about Astro Bot you know meanwhile you've got this going on over here on the other hand Sony puts out Astro Bot this week I don't know if any of you have had a chance to check it out I haven't checked it out myself I don't know PlayStation 5 I'll play it when it comes to PC if ever
1261375	1267097	But literally game of the year, unironic game of the year discussions going on with Astro Bot right now.
1267157	1268158	It's that good, apparently.
1269378	1273760	This is the platformer Sony has always needed.
1274140	1275540	They need a mascot character.
1275661	1278382	Yeah, and honestly, the Astro Bot VR game was pretty decent.
1279182	1281583	So I'm kind of not surprised to hear this.
1282663	1287025	But I guess I am surprised how loud...
1287665	1289827	People are about, nope, Astro Bot.
1289967	1291187	This is going to be the game of the year right here.
1292308	1292709	This is it.
1293569	1296731	So it's interesting that Sony does it in the scope of two weeks.
1297452	1301214	They launched the biggest flop and what may be the biggest success story of the year.
1302415	1302615	So.
1303516	1304697	The duality of man.
1306278	1310821	SHO and Hunter Matt in chat says, Concord, California is just happy they're the best Concord this week.
1311957	1312797	Forever and always.
1312817	1313678	I don't know.
1314058	1314778	The queues are shut down.
1314798	1315259	That's right.
1315659	1318700	That was one of our little intro bumper fake things a few weeks ago.
1318760	1320021	The Concord queues are shut down.
1320101	1322722	I did get a t-shirt from there before they closed.
1322922	1323403	Oh, I'm glad.
1323423	1323623	Yes.
1323983	1324843	So I have one.
1325344	1326164	It is a bit small, though.
1326524	1333288	But, like, yeah, it is technically the last one, not to change subjects, because S.T.A.R.S.
1333488	1335549	in Vacaville does not have queues there anymore.
1335689	1339511	They have another system now, which I gotta go check out, because it looks pretty cool.
1339551	1339691	But
1340191	1341292	I don't know, I'm kind of over it.
1341332	1344414	Like, QZAR's been, like, bankrupt and out of business for, like, years.
1344514	1346415	Like, I'm surprised that there's any still around.
1346895	1354601	And even the one that Concord had was, like, it was a brand new Q system that I've never played before, so it probably wouldn't have felt the same anyways.
1356062	1358283	It's just, you know, it is what it is.
1358363	1359324	Technology gets better.
1359444	1361745	Like, everything can't be done over radio nowadays.
1361805	1364727	I mean, it's got to be Bluetooth and stuff, because that makes sense.
1365047	1366789	And, you know, you can't run off of, like...
1367725	1369389	God, those computers are so old.
1369750	1370131	DOS.
1370271	1371454	I think they ran off DOS.
1371655	1373118	Like, they were that old.
1373760	1374903	It was just an old system.
1375063	1375584	What can you do?
1376772	1377352	What can you do?
1377512	1377853	All right.
1378473	1379553	Well, let's move on.
1379593	1388218	I want to talk to, before we get to our gaming weeks, I have another little piece for our kickoff tonight, and that is to talk about something kind of big that happened in the week we weren't here.
1389138	1395381	So there was a Nintendo Direct that happened when we weren't here, and there was a lot that they announced as a part of this Direct.
1395721	1398963	I'll quickly go through and talk about some of the headlines from this.
1399103	1402265	I don't know if I'll mention everything, but there's some things that definitely caught my eye.
1402345	1403065	I don't know about y'all.
1404065	1430740	Yakuza Kiwami going to be released on the Nintendo Switch will finally come out in October Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma also coming out on the Switch as well as the Legends of Heroes Trails in the Sky that is a remake that's going to be coming out for the Nintendo Switch pretty cool this is the one I think caught lots of people's eye I'm curious DarkSakura if it caught your eye because this is up your alley Castlevania Dominus Collection
1431680	1437704	This is great that we got this because this is all the DS games Dan and I talked about it Yeah?
1438164	1454495	So we weren't really so much into the DS games Interesting, okay The thing on there that really interested us the most, especially Dan, is the remake of Haunted Castle Yes, a little bonus thrown in, yeah
1454955	1464079	We watched a little bit of it and then started discussing, you know, like what platform might we want this on or, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
1464639	1468601	It's like, well, I'd really want an arcade stick to play this with, so Switch wouldn't really work.
1468881	1472143	And, you know, we were just sort of going back and forth about it.
1472463	1476284	And I mean, yeah, I could get it on Steam.
1476364	1477485	That wouldn't be a problem.
1478405	1480966	But it was very cool.
1481147	1483087	I'll absolutely give it that.
1483167	1483288	It's...
1485583	1486264	In the cards.
1488125	1489827	It was really unexpected, actually.
1490568	1494992	I didn't think they would try to port the DS games to the modern consoles.
1495032	1496533	I think that's really exciting, honestly.
1497414	1497975	I will check this.
1498035	1500677	Obviously, I've had a pretty busy week, but this is on my radar to check out.
1501038	1506423	It is on PlayStation 5 and I believe Xbox as well, question mark.
1506463	1509486	But I'll probably pick it up on PS5 for sure because I think that'll be really fun.
1509986	1519236	Well, and the other thing, though, for us is that, I mean, in the big picture, we've got TwitchCon coming up and, you know, adulting to do.
1519797	1521298	Yes, good point.
1521619	1525683	We won't be here in two weeks because TwitchCon, so it's a FYI.
1526644	1527585	Yep, exactly.
1529416	1536921	Also, kind of out of the blue, was a game that Konami had announced a couple years ago and then it disappeared.
1537602	1541485	Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster confirmed.
1541565	1545288	Not only is it coming to the Switch, we know this is multi-platform, but it was a Nintendo's event.
1545588	1547950	We finally have a date of March 6, 2025.
1548950	1556056	The game is now fully called Suikoden 1 and 2 HD Remaster Gate Dawn and Dunan Unification Wars.
1556916	1575284	you will also be able to speed up combat in the game kind of like you can in like the Final Fantasy 12 and 10 remasters they did which I think is really great and there's going to be an auto battle button so that's really cool this is fucking huge in my opinion this is why I'm like no we're going back to talk about last week I'm sorry
1576044	1597148	This Capcom Fighting Collection 2, DarkSakura, again, surely your ears must have perked up at the fact that this Capcom Fighting Collection 2 has Capcom versus SNK 1 and 2, Project Justice, hello, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and Power Stone 2.
1598349	1599589	This is incredible.
1600475	1602876	I think it also has Power Stone 1 as well, right?
1602916	1604217	Yeah, these are just some of the highlights.
1604257	1605617	I think it's got like 10 games in it.
1606478	1607538	Definitely on the agenda.
1607658	1610580	Yeah, this is... Love me some Power Stone.
1611660	1613841	It's coming out on the Switch, PS4, PC.
1613861	1615302	We'll talk about the Xbox version later.
1615342	1617203	It is coming out on Xbox, but it's delayed a little bit.
1618243	1625487	I'd honestly love to see just like a completely updated SD edition of Project Justice.
1625867	1626127	Yeah.
1626807	1627968	I think it would be beautiful.
1628976	1633207	Dark Tensia points out that Street Fighter Alpha 3 is the Naomi upgrade with more characters.
1633669	1634611	So, very cool.
1635674	1637098	Yeah, honestly, that was the...
1638379	1638980	Naomi.
1639760	1640321	Sorry, Naomi.
1640921	1647827	That was the jaw-dropping announcement of everything at this Direct for me, honestly, when they haven't even released the Marvel one yet.
1648647	1657494	I think it'd also be really fun to have Power Stone back just for those knockdown battles that we used to have over at my house on the Dreamcast.
1657674	1657835	Right?
1657875	1660457	I'm still surprised they haven't announced a new Power Stone.
1660537	1662699	Maybe this is going to be testing the waters for that?
1662779	1663079	I don't know.
1664009	1689515	well I think that's where all those polls were coming in because they were going to be doing this collection like I got the last the collection that had Red Earth in it and that one I like so this makes me happy now here's a genuine question because I don't know because I haven't seen anything in the arcades they don't Capcom doesn't do arcade ports of like their Street Fighter games anymore right?
1691665	1699808	Arcade Perfect Ports Arcade versions of their Street Fighter games Street Fighter 6 is an arcade game, right?
1699948	1707911	Yeah, they did Street Fighter 6 had an arcade release I don't ever see it in the arcade so that's why I asked I thought it was
1708431	1709152	No, it is.
1709232	1714477	It's just, I think Loki is more referring to this problem that it's arcades have nothing but ticket spitters.
1714757	1717099	You have to be at the right arcade to actually find a Street Fighter 6.
1717759	1718740	That's the problem.
1719421	1721503	But I think probably around 1, you might find one.
1722444	1728409	Well, didn't we play, like, the ones that was the test models that were at TwitchCon a couple years ago?
1729390	1730451	They had, like...
1731468	1735309	I mean, they may have been Xbox Ones with arcade stick setups.
1735389	1735849	I don't know now.
1735869	1738909	There's people in chat confirming there's arcade release.
1739170	1742830	They're in candy cabs in Japan, says Bubby Blackwolf.
1742950	1749411	Here, by the way, since we keep talking about what's in this, here's the full list of games in that Capcom Fighting Collection 2.
1750272	1752412	Capcom vs. SNK 1 and 2.
1753332	1754653	Capcom Fighting Evolution.
1755233	1756613	Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper.
1757233	1764336	Project Justice, Power Stone 1, Power Stone 2, and Plasma Sword, Nightmare of Girl Style is also in this.
1764817	1767318	So you can play online, of course.
1767378	1771320	There's training localized in 14 languages with a museum.
1772701	1776062	This is fucking rad, honestly.
1776162	1783206	Like I don't even really get into fighting games anymore that often, but like you had me at Capcom versus SNK 2.
1783326	1784046	You had me at that.
1784126	1785767	And then Power Stone on top of that?
1787586	1788227	One and two?
1788427	1789348	Pinch me!
1791129	1793231	Anyway, also part of the Nintendo Direct.
1793311	1794772	Five Nights at Freddy's games!
1794852	1798215	I kind of didn't realize all of these weren't already on the Switch, but sure.
1798655	1802658	Help 1 and 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch, and then Security Breach is coming.
1802919	1805781	There's a lot of Five Nights at Freddy's coming out as well.
1806682	1809364	Let's see, Tales of Grace's F Remastered is coming out.
1810064	1810165	Um...
1810825	1811666	I hope I say this right.
1811726	1812366	Bellatro?
1812446	1813247	Is that the name of this game?
1813287	1814028	That card game?
1814168	1814328	Yeah.
1814348	1815209	That everybody's talking about?
1815229	1815769	I haven't played this.
1815789	1816229	I have it on Steam.
1816269	1816990	I haven't played it yet.
1817050	1817490	Is it fun?
1817671	1818171	I'm curious.
1818191	1819972	Like, a lot of people I know are kind of addicted to this.
1820012	1821634	I see Nick playing it a lot.
1821694	1822434	Nick really likes it.
1822454	1823575	I'm going to have to check this out.
1823655	1826818	But Bellatro is coming out on Switch, obviously, is what I'm talking about here.
1826838	1831202	But they're also teaming up with... Actually, I think it might already be on Switch.
1831682	1836766	The news is that they're teaming up with The Witcher 3, Vampire Survivors, and Among Us.
1836806	1838908	There's going to be themed decks with it.
1839728	1840149	I believe...
1840609	1867220	I'm crossing wires in my mind because I think they also announced this for mobile recently I think that's why my brain is going it's coming out on Switch no it's coming out on mobile and they announced the expansion stuff during the Nintendo event so I'm gonna have to check this out because everybody seems to be really into it that I know this I thought was interesting because you know I love me some Civilization Civilization 7 is coming to the Nintendo Switch at launch on February 11th 2025 and you know what that tells me
1868186	1872670	Graphics are not going to be cutting edge in this game, apparently.
1872990	1875433	Graphics aren't the most important thing.
1875533	1875933	That's right.
1875953	1877775	We don't play Civ 7 for the graphics.
1878315	1878876	It would have been nice.
1879116	1880798	But we don't play Civ 7.
1881178	1882479	You play to conquer the world.
1882579	1883540	That's why you play, right?
1885702	1886102	That's true.
1886243	1886603	That's true.
1887284	1890647	I play so I can actually be the Queen of England for a day.
1890667	1891487	Okay.
1892608	1898132	Are y'all ready for Power Wash Simulator to get Shrek DLC?
1898252	1898652	That's right.
1898732	1899693	Now you can power.
1899953	1901534	You don't just have to get out of the swamp.
1901654	1902855	Now you can power wash it.
1904196	1910100	You almost think you'd feel like, you know, because it is Shrek that you should be like spraying mud on things.
1910121	1912442	It should go the other way around, don't you think?
1912702	1915104	But you're spraying glitter or you're spraying off glitter.
1915124	1916185	So I guess that works.
1917183	1921465	Sea of Stars got a new trailer for the Throws of the Watchmaker DLC.
1921525	1923646	I know some of you folks love your Sea of Stars.
1923706	1924106	I get it.
1924506	1926487	So that DLC is coming soon.
1926987	1932069	Also in the coming soon department, the Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake.
1933029	1935410	That is being released on November 14th.
1935610	1937491	That is very exciting as well.
1938651	1942273	And then Goat Simulator 3 was shadow dropped on Switch.
1942713	1945674	So if you don't have Goat Simulator 3 yet, you can check that out on the Switch.
1945814	1946375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1965672	1970576	They let Tetris and the 40th anniversary of Tetris be the lead with this.
1970916	1977081	But in celebration of the 40th year anniversary of Tetris, there is a Goldmaster collection from Digital Eclipse coming out.
1977681	1983666	It's going to include something called Tetris Time Warp because Digital Eclipse likes to do these kind of modern takes on the games in the Gold series.
1984407	1986509	There's an interactive museum where you can play
1987069	1991834	The original Famicom version of Tetris, which is not the same as the Nintendo version of Tetris.
1992134	2000382	They announced that that will be coming as the Nintendo Switch Online, which actually surprised me that they had the rights to be able to do that.
2000442	2001963	So that was very cool, honestly.
2002824	2007828	Super Bomb Bliss, Super Tetris 2 and Bomb Bliss, Tetris Battle Gaiden, and Super Tetris 3.
2008369	2011352	And of course, everybody was asking, where's the Grandmaster?
2011840	2016245	Well, Arcade Archives and Hamster, whoever puts that out, has the rights to that.
2016525	2018307	You can get that on the Switch right now if you want.
2019348	2021730	But these are the games that are going to make up this.
2021850	2031580	And the Gold Master Series from Digital Clips, if you are a gaming history, you like that type of stuff, if you believe in game preservation stuff...
2032681	2033841	It's the gold standard.
2033941	2034982	It's not an ironic name.
2035082	2037843	It is the gold standard of how to fucking preserve games.
2038083	2040083	So I will be getting this as soon as it comes out.
2040523	2042864	And it also has Hatris, which is awesome.
2042884	2043824	Does it have Hatris?
2044364	2045085	It does have Hatris.
2045105	2047805	Does it have Wordtris and Facetris and Weltris?
2047825	2048786	No, just Hatris.
2048906	2049646	Okay, that's fine.
2050509	2052930	Blastress, which is the coolest to say.
2053550	2059791	Bobby Blackwolf points out you also get the literal original computer version on the Russian computer, the Electronica 60.
2060431	2061231	I think that's pretty cool.
2061271	2062492	I think they had to remake it.
2062552	2065812	I don't think it's like an emulator for the Electronica 60, but close enough.
2066932	2068833	Oh, I love that Tetris time warp thing.
2068873	2069413	Have you seen that?
2069533	2069973	I have.
2069993	2071573	Yeah, it looks really cool, huh?
2071633	2072854	The ASCII stuff.
2072994	2073474	That's awesome.
2073494	2074034	Yep, yep.
2074994	2076536	Well, that's the original Tetris, of course.
2076676	2085443	So anyway, it does not include, unfortunately, VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf contributed to a game in the 90s called Acid Tris.
2085483	2087144	Was it Acid Tris or Acid Tetris?
2087204	2087564	One of the two.
2088845	2095350	Acid Tetris is not a part of this collection, so I'm sorry you'll have to stick to... It's too cool for that collection.
2096271	2099754	I hear the composer would not license the rights to the music.
2100334	2100955	No, I'm just kidding.
2101075	2101715	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2101735	2102356	I'm starting rumors.
2102716	2103217	They didn't ask.
2104778	2108502	It's available on the Internet Archive, though, at least for now, if you want to check that out.
2109243	2114208	Another shadow drop of a game called Pizza Tower that looks like it's very Wario Land-esque.
2115049	2119994	If you love yourself some Metal Slug and you love yourself some tactical games, guess what?
2120074	2120995	Metal Slug Tactics
2121772	2122352	Fall of 2024.
2123313	2124593	Oh boy, oh boy.
2125874	2127115	And then, let's see, one more.
2127215	2132117	Shovel Knight, Shovel of Hope Deluxe coming out in 2025.
2132297	2133498	A recent classic game.
2133818	2134278	That's right.
2134458	2135038	Very recent.
2135099	2136359	It's almost like you read their mind.
2137720	2139120	You didn't, but it's almost like you did.
2140421	2141542	How dare they read my mind?
2142102	2145524	There's more stuff they announced too, but that was kind of the tip of the iceberg.
2145544	2147905	You're not going to talk about Coffee Talk Tokyo?
2148225	2149005	Coffee Talk.
2149526	2150406	Coffee Talk Tokyo.
2152916	2154337	No, I apparently missed that one.
2154357	2155879	Come by us in Shibuya.
2155919	2156499	We'll talk.
2161124	2161684	There you go.
2162084	2162845	Now I'm verklempt.
2163586	2164346	Here's the topic.
2164707	2165307	Shibuya.
2165728	2167369	Neither a shoe nor booyah.
2167549	2167970	Discuss.
2170054	2173295	By the way, DarkSakura, I did not see disco.
2173495	2175956	I did see full cosplay.
2176076	2184000	I saw a full-on Linda Richmond in cosplay with the sweater, the wig, big glasses, and was carrying around a little picture.
2184080	2188642	It was either like a Barbara vinyl or was carrying around like a photo of Barbara.
2189042	2192603	And I was like, that's the best cosplay I'll see the whole fucking convention right there.
2193243	2194244	That's great.
2194404	2196605	Someone should have been Madonna as her friend.
2198769	2199369	Could you imagine?
2199409	2203372	I'm telling you, the cosplay at DragonCon, next level.
2203432	2206173	I'll talk more about DragonCon in this next segment, but I will say this.
2207914	2216999	The one and only Mr. Alan Alchemy, my husband, has asked that he will not go to DragonCon next year.
2217099	2222962	He likes it, but it's just a little too... For his introversion senses, he's a little too... But...
2226184	2233230	Who is going to come next year, confirmed, because the minute she heard that Alan wasn't going, she was like, maybe I want to come.
2233631	2234592	I do want to come, actually.
2235412	2242399	Victoria, or Arya Snark, my old pal from Shaking and Crying, who by the way is a cosplay queen all her own.
2242859	2245941	She's known in some of those Disney circles like D23 and stuff.
2245961	2249882	So I'm really hoping she brings some of her Disney stuff to DragonCon.
2249902	2250403	So look for it.
2250423	2251623	She has bought her membership.
2251923	2255965	So this is not like a DragonCon 2025.
2256566	2258386	We will be shaking and crying in person.
2258667	2259067	Believe it.
2259607	2260687	So check that out.
2261548	2261828	All right.
2262408	2266190	Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week.
2266670	2267931	So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2271151	2274812	I played, of course, some Dead by Daylight.
2275752	2278493	I played some Palia.
2279813	2285494	I have the casting of Frank Stone, which does look like I'll be able to play it tonight.
2286695	2290856	I did just a little bit of it to test the game.
2292956	2295937	And what else did I do?
2299623	2299944	Why not now?
2319855	2339584	Okay, I went to see Sterlok, who was visiting, and I drove quite a bit to go talk, and we went to a pub and had a great meal, and his mom is a total Disney nerd and an absolute trip, and I adore his folks.
2339744	2340404	They're so nice.
2341465	2343966	I would have gone too if I didn't have Convid.
2345476	2373626	it was really great to finally get to hang out in person and just have great conversations and I'd like to say that he is as kind and personable in person as he is over texts and chats and things and I had a great time and as it worked out because I had no idea where this place was originally because I don't know California geography super great
2374740	2395754	um I ended up uh since I had to go through Petaluma um I went back and saw Susan who is one of as we call it the OG Jew crew out here um me and my friends from synagogue um and so we hung out for a while and went to
2396514	2398115	The Death Star was so good.
2398496	2402139	We got a dark ale that was called The Death Star and it was amazing.
2402599	2405542	It would give Guinness a run for its money.
2406102	2407603	Yeah, The Death Star was amazing.
2408584	2411426	But I stopped by in South Susan and we went to a cafe.
2411486	2415169	I came back with so many leftovers because my stomach was just a wreck yesterday.
2416250	2442772	um but um it was it was overall you know I had a great time it was good catching up with Susan because it's been a couple years but really a lot of fun uh hanging out with Sturlock we had I think a marvelous time and I I'm looking forward to doing it again um on the next visit and maybe spending a little bit more time so a great absolute great time nice
2443285	2443665	Love to hear it.
2444666	2447188	Love to hear friends of the show meeting IRL.
2447288	2447688	That's great.
2448849	2449110	All right.
2449650	2450531	Let's move on to Loki.
2450551	2451211	How was your gaming week?
2452292	2455495	It was mostly Minecraft and editing, that type of stuff.
2455535	2456916	Actually, I think it was mostly editing.
2457496	2469926	I did put out an episode earlier this week off of this spin-off SMP that I was playing on with some of the other members from our SMP and...
2471893	2475235	Some, I think, from other things, Orthoblox and whatnot.
2475735	2480717	And so it was kind of like a survival challenge thing where the whole world was frozen.
2481377	2486219	And so I played a Mr. Freeze character in that.
2487000	2492362	And so I've been kind of having fun grinding through that, but I've kind of run out of things to do in it.
2492442	2494283	So I put out a episode that covers...
2495565	2516240	very fast everything that I did in it and then add some story that can integrate into the channel 64 stuff as well that's fun we did some like animation stuff in there as well and yeah it bombed no one watched it yay keep keep
2517136	2517997	Put that link in chat.
2518137	2519479	Get some more clicks from chat right now.
2520180	2521602	So, there you go.
2522723	2525387	Alright, we gotta get more eyes on Loki's stuff.
2525487	2528751	Somebody, somebody, one of these days, the right person's gonna see it.
2529432	2529913	Keep at it.
2530734	2531014	Yep.
2531574	2531795	All right.
2531815	2532675	Long after I'm gone.
2533876	2534216	Stop.
2534816	2535116	All right.
2535576	2539478	Well, we're going to come back to you in Minecraft in just a minute because boy, do I have a question for you.
2540499	2543140	But meanwhile, let's go to my gaming week.
2543220	2546382	So most of my games this week, you know, Final Fantasy 14.
2547022	2552025	I got my dancer to level 100 max level 70 PS and a little bit Diablo 4 as well.
2552625	2552825	DragonCon
2583105	2592211	and Manny Jacinto from The Good Place who also plays a key character in Star Wars Acolyte and asked these questions and banter back and forth with.
2592271	2600396	It was really wild and really an honor and delight so I really truly thank DragonCon for trusting me to do it and I had a good time.
2600996	2602497	So I'll talk a little more in depth about those panels.
2602537	2603478	I got to do one for...
2604278	2607520	Yes, Bobby Blackwolf says Giancarlo Esposito erasure.
2607720	2611123	No, Natasha Lou Bordizzo also very lovely.
2611203	2612063	They were all great.
2612143	2615205	Just we'll talk more about it on an upcoming show.
2616066	2622810	So Star Trek Lower Decks, probably the funniest fucking panel I've ever done in my entire life, was so good.
2623471	2624231	We'll talk about that as well.
2624291	2627413	But from the gaming front, I got to do a couple of panels.
2627894	2630936	So the very first panel of my convention, well...
2632048	2633608	I did a meetup Thursday night.
2633688	2640150	So VOG Network actually hosted on the digital media track a cool little meetup, which was just like a meet and greet.
2640230	2643411	And we had like icebreaker topics that would rotate on the board.
2643471	2646712	Like what's a promo that you like to use to promote yourself?
2646772	2648332	What's a key piece of software you use?
2648633	2650553	So we kind of, you know, we're able to meet some people.
2650613	2653074	I would say I made some really good connections.
2653134	2657435	If anybody from Thursday night's meetup is out there listening tonight, hello and welcome and thank you for being here.
2658396	2659577	That was really cool.
2659617	2660798	We want to do that again next year.
2660838	2666985	We didn't have a lot of notice this year, so we're going to do it next year with some more notice and try to bring in some more people because we had a lot of fun.
2668607	2675394	Worked with a TikToker who had millions of views when they were viral, so it's kind of interesting to hear about their experience about all that.
2675714	2676475	Yeah, it was very cool.
2677276	2681158	But my first actual panel that I did was Friday morning.
2681518	2685540	And so I had a ballroom panel, which was an hour with Amelia Gotham.
2686160	2687501	And she is a voice actress.
2687681	2689762	And we're going to talk about this term in a little bit.
2689802	2692944	But for the game she worked with, it was just voice acting.
2694184	2695685	I say just, but it's important.
2696385	2699487	She is best known as Princess Mipha.
2699507	2700967	Nice.
2701768	2705750	Yeah, she was that in the... I almost said the link to the past.
2705770	2705990	Sorry.
2706570	2709453	I've got a little bit of the brain thing going on with everything that's happened this week.
2710915	2711615	Breath of the Wild.
2712476	2715479	She played Princess Mipha in a very key couple of scenes in that game.
2715840	2724349	And then they actually kind of ended up expanding on the character in the action-y Zelda game.
2725490	2726531	God damn it.
2727732	2729174	Sorry, my brain is...
2730891	2732432	Age of Calamity Age of Calamity
2754147	2781581	that you know so she was still part of that so we got to do a nice panel and she she has done other video games she actually has a Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns is actually an early credit on her resume I think she did Moogle voices in that game she's additional voices credit but I think she was a lot of the Moogles in that game so she she did some other cool little stuff so she had a ballroom for her panel and I gotta say I was I was really bummed for her that only eight people showed up for the panel and
2781881	2785282	So, you know, but, you know, and this happens sometimes.
2785442	2793983	And sometimes because it's early morning or because I think what happened in this case, this panel was not added to the schedule until late.
2794343	2796444	So it did not make the printed programs.
2796504	2797764	It was only in the app.
2798464	2810206	And, you know, especially Friday, right when the whole thing is really getting underway for a lot of people, I just think it was just an unfortunate sort of arithmetic of issues that caused
2810566	2811506	People Do Not Really Turn Up.
2811586	2815788	It also was not in the usual video game spot, which I think was a key issue too.
2816188	2818669	Most of the video game panels are at the Westin.
2819029	2820490	This one was over at the Hyatt.
2820590	2824812	And I think that does make a difference when your fans are kind of spread out a little bit.
2824892	2826132	So it is what it is.
2826633	2831434	And I had kind of joked with her before when we had a sense that there might not be a lot of people that turn up.
2831475	2832375	I said, you know what?
2832415	2834856	We do the same show, whether it's two people or 200 people.
2834896	2836016	And she said, I like that.
2836036	2837417	That's the sign of a professional.
2837897	2862499	and I appreciated her saying that and you know what we did we had a really long I wish we'd recorded it you know going back hindsight 2020 um I if I'd known it wasn't going to be recorded by Dragon Con I would have brought a recorder because it was really lovely just to have an in-depth chat with her because sure we talked plenty about Zelda and her character and that and what all went into that scene but with the time allotted we were able to really go in depth about
2862819	2869308	Her acting background, she's actually from theater, as you will find a lot of voice actors come from that background.
2869348	2871450	They are not just voice actors, they are actors.
2872031	2879681	If I may interject, something that Neil Newborn has been quoted saying is that it's not voice acting, it's acting.
2880543	2884164	We're going to come back to that because that got brought up live.
2884504	2886085	But I'll get to that in a minute.
2887125	2892227	Anyway, with Amelia, I got to talk to her about that.
2892607	2894308	And we got to talk about inspiration.
2894688	2897749	And the audience got to ask a couple questions.
2898409	2901690	They didn't have a lot because there wasn't that many of them, but they got to ask basically whatever they wanted.
2902090	2904671	And one of the guys was asking about who were...
2905692	2907654	Who was the coolest celebrity you ever met?
2907854	2908535	I thought that was neat.
2908895	2911658	And her answer was actually John Waters.
2912478	2921287	And it took everything within me to not say... And this is me doing good because we're not supposed to make the panels about ourselves.
2922048	2926452	Which, yes, this is hard for me to do because in this, yes, I do get to talk about myself.
2926773	2928755	But it took everything within me to not jump in and go...
2929355	2932156	I met John Waters too, and I love him, you know?
2932456	2935257	So I had to be like, oh, how, you know, so we had to ask this question.
2935658	2940259	And then when it was over, I told her, I said, oh my God, when you brought up John Waters, I love him.
2940640	2942080	You know, we kind of got to talk about that.
2942400	2944481	So she was just really cool.
2944961	2946482	I just liked her as a person.
2946542	2949163	She's really down to earth, as a lot of these folks are.
2949583	2951464	And I thought we were able to have a great conversation.
2951564	2955846	And it really is going to be the biggest crime of DragonCon that that was not recorded.
2956246	2958367	And so 10 people in that room,
2959167	2961408	Got a very special thing that will never be repeated.
2961448	2962348	I'm very sorry to say.
2963129	2966050	But Amelia Gotham, lovely, lovely human.
2966350	2968411	And I really wish her much success.
2968451	2972692	I hope she shows up in future Nintendo games and whatever stuff.
2972712	2975333	I hope her career goes very well because I thought she was very lovely.
2977334	2979095	Also did a panel.
2979175	2981275	Okay, so the other gaming-related panel.
2981616	2986858	So Saturday morning, right after the parade, was my Baldur's Gate 3...
2988649	2988789	Thanks.
2988869	2989069	Thanks.
2989090	2989310	Thanks.
3008670	3009530	was her girlfriend there?
3009711	3029160	yes her girlfriend was there and I actually rearranged the name tags before we started so they could sit next to each other because I was like that's not going to work let me just tell you those two are madly in love madly in love you can see it it was radiating from the stage here's the reality of the way these conventions work
3029640	3030982	Yes, I moderated the panel.
3031302	3041294	That does not mean I like hung out with them or spent a lot of extended time with them because the reality is they're making money while they're at con.
3041534	3043497	When they're at a panel, they're not making money.
3043977	3048543	So they have to clear out the lines for their table, hold the line, get them away from the table.
3048983	3053049	and there was a whole other complication because the DragonCon parade happened Saturday morning.
3053390	3054452	So it took them some time.
3054572	3059740	They walked into the Westin right in the there's little backstage areas where they come in.
3060240	3064166	They came in like one minute before the panel was supposed to start.
3064747	3069008	So I really just got to say, hello, hello, verify some of the pronunciations.
3069308	3075330	Like Jennifer's girlfriend, Iona, she actually asked me, she said, do you know how to pronounce my name?
3075730	3076710	Which I actually appreciate.
3076810	3078711	I don't want to fuck that up on stage, right?
3078811	3079671	I want to get it right.
3080471	3087533	Anyway, I also want to mention Theo, who plays Will, who was actually one of my favorite characters in the game, was also there as well.
3087553	3088614	So it was a really good...
3090929	3093290	a mix of the cast that was there.
3093710	3099113	And I got to say, like for an hour, it really felt like there was just like this family reunion going on.
3099173	3102234	You feel how close knit this group is.
3103075	3107777	And I really just felt like I got to like peek into that just for an hour and ask these questions.
3108177	3111819	Well, one of the questions that came up, so I had Neil sitting next to me.
3112799	3116321	Y'all, I had Neil sitting next to me.
3118201	3119322	I'm full of hatred right now.
3120700	3122022	I'm not gonna lie, you should.
3122583	3126308	And this is one of those things where it's like, I'm just, like, pinch me.
3126388	3128151	That period happened, period.
3128552	3134881	But, you know, I'm a professional, and I would never let Neil know that he's a very, very, very handsome man.
3136303	3137443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DragonCon
3155290	3155831	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3170365	3177052	I fucking loved it because if the audience was targeting certain people with questions, which is what happens, right?
3177412	3183579	When you get a lineup, you know, and the lineup I just mentioned, you can imagine there were one or two people on that panel that were getting more questions than others.
3183899	3189725	But what I could do is then, aha, here's a question from Discord and I'm going to throw this at somebody who's not getting a lot of questions.
3190045	3192007	And I love that as a moderator to be able to do that.
3192408	3193068	And I will say,
3193949	3194390	and DarkSakura.com.
3216664	3217125	You're welcome.
3217285	3220028	Like, yeah, I wanted to make sure everybody had a say, right?
3220449	3222992	So that was really cool.
3223073	3228840	But one of the questions that came in on Discord was, I have a question as an aspiring voice actor.
3229441	3231484	And that's where Neil said, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
3231764	3232324	Actors, Actors, Actors
3248570	3273157	so just call us actors and I said okay we can do that and then I read the rest of the question which really was about voice acting tips and I think it was Dev who piped in and said well now Neil the question really was about voice acting now wasn't it so I did so it kind of took a little bit of the heat off of me as the moderator because I was just kind of but I'm really glad that topic did come up because yes especially it is interesting a game like
3273937	3298870	Zelda Breath of the Wild which may have done mocap in Japan but certainly not with what Amelia did um she really was just doing voice acting not to diminish her talents she's fantastic and and all but it is a like that was voice acting and what the Baldur's Gate folks did was acting they had the mocap suits they did that and so it is something we need to be aware of these days and uh um
3300110	3305075	Uh, folks who want to get into voice acting need to be prepared to get into acting.
3305916	3306056	Yeah.
3306677	3307838	Um, going to some comments in chat.
3308078	3315605	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the Red Dead Redemption 2 panelists did the same and used performance actor as their preferred term a few years back.
3315885	3321611	That's the term I started to lobby thinking they would say the same thing, but no, it actually wasn't that.
3321671	3322692	So there was, there was that.
3323272	3323352	Um,
3324173	3342246	and by the way I gave the feedback to the appropriate channels at DragonCon and in future years you should no longer see things labeled just voice actor so it is so yay it's just that's just a relic of the past because again 20 years ago before we had uh that type of motion cap acting it really was nothing but voice acting so it is what it is we got it um
3344073	3349034	DJ Ranma S in chat says, most voice actors I know would prefer you to call them voice actors.
3349314	3360777	But Ranma, I'm going to guess that's because you come from an anime background, an anime jam session, and they're not doing anything but voice for anime because it's animated, right?
3361198	3368139	So I think maybe it is a good policy to ask, what do you prefer to be credited as?
3368439	3370280	Actor, performance actor, voice?
3370720	3371321	Voice Actor.
3371761	3376607	We're going to need to ask that question as moderators and people that put on panels, and I fully plan to do so.
3377348	3380192	DW Wreckage in chat says, that's a great system for Q&A.
3381013	3381693	100% agree.
3382314	3384297	I want all the QA to be like that in the future.
3384697	3387521	I really hope DragonCon adopts that as the new standard, to be quite honest.
3387981	3388882	So, yeah.
3389302	3389622	Let's see.
3389922	3397047	Questbuster in chat says, I did everything I could to redeem Astarion, such a fantastic character, and Neil was a huge part.
3397407	3401450	All the characters in Baldur's Gate were really amazing, and the actors did such a great job bringing them to life.
3401750	3401450	100%.
3402390	3403651	That was just such a fun panel.
3404131	3407694	And, you know, as moderators and essentially as a DragonCon volunteer...
3408274	3408654	I love it.
3408754	3409175	I love it.
3435865	3436626	Yes, I do.
3436786	3437486	Thank you.
3437987	3443391	And so, and this is from my Instagram, so I'm sorry to show a picture of a picture, but there it is.
3444391	3444652	Nice.
3446133	3446693	That's awesome.
3447754	3448294	You're muted.
3448715	3448975	No.
3449055	3449395	Sorry.
3449695	3449916	Sorry.
3449996	3452197	When I was holding up the thing, I brushed the mute button.
3452217	3452418	Sorry.
3453058	3453698	But that happened.
3453759	3456320	That was just really fucking cool that that happened.
3456401	3458042	It was just a loss of words.
3458242	3458742	Yeah, it was.
3458802	3461244	It was just a loss of words for how amazing that whole experience was.
3461264	3461905	Well, you've beclumped.
3462305	3462705	I was.
3462865	3463246	I was.
3465404	3466485	Talk amongst yourselves.
3467246	3468007	I'll give you a topic.
3468027	3468949	I'll give you a topic.
3468969	3473394	That selfie was neither self nor e. Discuss.
3473414	3474255	Baldur's Gate.
3474736	3476518	Neither bald nor a gate.
3476679	3477259	Discuss.
3481244	3481745	All right.
3481825	3483668	And then one other panel I did.
3484909	3485810	ZELDA, JAPANESE COMPANY
3503709	3505729	Baldur's Gate, European Company.
3506550	3511951	So they were not subject to the same thing that Mass Effect was, which was the voice actor roundup.
3512671	3513871	So I got to do a cool little panel.
3514011	3517112	Bobby did the same panel on a different day with an extra.
3517192	3521192	So Saren, Fred who played Saren was also on Bobby's panel.
3521232	3523893	He was not on mine because he didn't get to the convention until Saturday.
3524353	3529494	But it was Courtney Taylor who plays Jack, Ash who plays...
3530854	3534955	Tali, and Mark Muir, of course, who plays Mail Shepherd.
3534975	3535816	We're all on this panel.
3536216	3540657	And I was actually very thankful to Courtney because she actually offered backstage.
3540697	3543538	Again, we don't get a lot of time to talk backstage, but I let them know.
3543598	3546139	I said, hey, I'm aware of what's going on with the strike.
3546179	3549240	And Courtney was kind of like, well, we can talk about it.
3549300	3551481	We just can't advertise it as Mass Effect.
3551701	3553362	She's like, do you want me to talk about it?
3553462	3556163	And I was like, yes, actually, I would fucking love that.
3556243	3557083	So I didn't use that word.
3557143	3558343	But, you know, yes, I would love that.
3558384	3559424	I'm sure my expression showed it.
3559884	3568654	So we actually started and Cordy was able to give a nice, long, deep dive about why the strike is important and why these AI protections are important.
3568874	3575381	And if we don't fight for these AI protections with voice actors, it's going to come for other industries as well.
3575461	3581108	So voice actors and actors are really at the forefront of these types of protections because it's coming for every industry.
3581468	3581949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3603732	3604934	So she did a great job explaining that.
3605414	3612182	Now I, so somewhere along the, I was told when I started that we were not to talk about Mass Effect.
3612643	3616067	And so I fielded all the questions and we had a great discussion.
3616087	3619030	We had a great hour where I did not bring up Mass Effect at all.
3619591	3620492	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3639608	3644469	I took about voice acting, other projects, other, you know, elements.
3644829	3648350	You know, there was a lot of like D&D related things, you know, just a lot of other like random questions.
3648410	3649691	I thought we still had a great discussion.
3650131	3654332	And to be quite honest, how old is Mass Effect at this point?
3654512	3658273	You know, we are all still drawn to this game because it's so good.
3658453	3660053	But I think... Except Rob.
3660333	3660533	What?
3660613	3663014	There was that trailer for the fifth Mass Effect.
3664294	3667115	Yeah, but we don't have confirmation any of these actors are in it.
3668570	3671232	We do know that Liara's voice actor is in it.
3671272	3672853	Jennifer Hale has signed up for it.
3672994	3674855	There's a few of them.
3675035	3675836	Yeah, that's fair.
3676336	3676697	That's fair.
3676777	3680039	But neither of those individuals are in the room.
3680439	3684443	And plus, you have to be very careful talking about future projects.
3684703	3689867	As a moderator, I usually filter the future project questions out just because it's a slippery slope.
3689887	3691588	But you were bringing up relevance.
3691708	3691869	Yeah.
3692569	3698835	No, and I want to be careful using that because obviously Mass Effect has diehard fans till the end.
3698975	3702138	I'm one of them, you know, and there's plenty of them at DragonCon that still dress up.
3702158	3709704	But I'm just like, I'm more thinking of the whole like, I think about like actors that were on Star Trek The Next Generation who are also at DragonCon.
3710936	3716379	How many fucking years can you talk about Star Trek The Next Generation without wanting to talk about something else?
3716399	3718500	That's the person who went on the Star Trek cruise.
3718781	3723924	No, I know, but I love it when they don't talk about Star Trek, quite honestly.
3724164	3726885	I love to hear about their other passions.
3727005	3734110	Last year's strike year was actually some of the best panels that ever happened at DragonCon because they had to talk about something else.
3734770	3735330	It was great.
3736431	3737692	But that is a personal opinion.
3738052	3739533	Not everybody feels the same way.
3739673	3741594	So, you know, we mix it up.
3742515	3744696	The best panels mix it up a little bit.
3744796	3748118	So anyway, I went really long on the DragonCon.
3748158	3751260	We'll talk more about other panels too, but those are the gaming-related ones.
3752260	3753001	I had a great time.
3753561	3755102	I'll be going back to DragonCon next year.
3755202	3762126	What panels I get to do, that's on DragonCon, but I really, really, really hope I'm asked to do some of the big fun ones again because I had a great time.
3763567	3764788	on my personal list.
3765329	3770233	So not that I have anything to do with who gets booked for DragonCon, but I'm curious.
3770293	3777239	Let's assume everybody here, you all are capable of moderating panels at a convention, and if you haven't yet, you'll do it someday.
3777679	3781382	Who would be your dream video game-related panel?
3782043	3786147	Because I'll tell you mine in a heartbeat, the panel I want to do.
3786967	3790691	But I'm curious, what video game panel would you want to moderate?
3790771	3791051	Loki?
3792537	3793877	What video game panel would you want to monitor?
3794918	3796258	What panel?
3799359	3799759	I don't know.
3799919	3804620	I would think... What would be a property I'd be really excited about?
3804780	3807541	I mean, Minecraft stuff, but not necessarily.
3808041	3813422	I'm trying to think of TV stuff that would be fun.
3818944	3819884	Yeah, I'd see my...
3821252	3832640	Yeah, like, I would say, like, probably Minecraft is what I'm most familiar with, but, like, even, like, entertainment-wise, I would say something like, um, like, any of the Marvel panels would be fun, or even, like, the boys.
3833680	3835141	Yeah, they had that, yeah.
3835221	3843227	Anthony Starr is, you know, he'd be a lot of fun, and, um, uh, I'm trying to think what else.
3843247	3845048	Alright, well, let me go to DarkSakura.
3845208	3846489	What would be your dream panel, DarkSakura?
3847324	3851525	I'd probably want to do something with, like, the early days of Compile.
3853226	3854646	Ooh, you're like, okay.
3855147	3856047	Okay, I like that.
3856127	3858027	Going, like, video game history panels.
3858308	3858668	Heck yeah.
3858728	3863369	I've got a list of people that I would love to just have on the show in general.
3863529	3868351	But, you know me, I go for the classic stuff or, like, the super technical stuff.
3868391	3872232	Like, I would, you know, want to do a focus on, like, say, mocap.
3873968	3900829	or something that's like a panel of people who do this event who may not necessarily be in the same game you know so something that's a little bit more peel back the layers of this aspect of the industry or about sound designers have like Koji Kondo or Uematsu or you know yeah it's about it's sound one would be good
3901212	3905235	I was going to say, too bad it's a dead series now, but like the Saints Row people would have been fun.
3905315	3909418	Like back when we're talking like back in the original first or third games.
3910043	3933165	sometimes they'll do like a 10th anniversary just because the game has got like the original Mortal Kombat mocap folks were on a panel with Bobby last year so you know the brothers that did like half the cast were these two brothers they were on a panel with Bobby last year so sometimes they do that stuff like a reunion type of panel it's possible okay so mine across all mediums anything not just games Tim Curry
3933685	3935366	I mean, come on, how can I not say Tim Curry?
3936266	3936606	That's it.
3937887	3946550	While we still can't, I believe he still does Q&A and that type of stuff, but, you know, obviously, since the stroke, he's a little more limited in mobility, but I would love to see him do that.
3946570	3948691	He's someone I would just want to have tea with, Rob.
3948791	3949631	Right, right.
3950652	3953093	But in video games specifically... For our birthday.
3954457	3956819	In video games specifically, Ben Starr.
3957219	3958780	I want the Ben Starr panel.
3959200	3961922	I want the chaotic energy that Ben Starr would bring to DragonCon.
3961983	3964344	And quite frankly, I'm surprised he wasn't at this DragonCon.
3964664	3966326	But maybe he's working on a project or something.
3966366	3967567	But that's the panel I want.
3968027	3968767	That or...
3969690	3996202	Jonathan Bailey who is in Final Fantasy 14 as Grahatia but he's done he's in a lot of stuff now he's in he's gonna be in Wicked he's in damn it there's some other my brain is is frying a little bit so yeah that would that would be like how about a panel with both of them and Gideon Emery will be a Final Fantasy voice acting panel we'll just do that
3999450	4003512	I would want him for Dragon Age stuff.
4003532	4004073	Oh.
4004753	4006133	They've had Dragon Age folks.
4006314	4008915	Well, a lot of the people that do Mass Effect also do Dragon Age.
4009195	4010115	So, yeah.
4012361	4013261	Anyway, all right.
4013582	4014662	That's enough about Khan.
4015402	4018224	Please look forward to next year in just under 360 days.
4018644	4018964	All right.
4019885	4023926	Now, looking forward a little bit, let's talk about this.
4024607	4034111	Loki, I've been dying for the last few days to ask you, our resident Minecraft fan, about a little something that hit the internet this week.
4034612	4037413	Could you please tell us about it and your thoughts?
4038402	4066105	well I mean so we knew this was coming and we've seen like leaks of images so it wasn't a complete shock but the Minecraft movie teaser trailer has finally been released it was like a minute or so of the movie it's a live action and CG movie which from the outset like when I heard about this like years ago
4067233	4068314	I don't think that's a bad idea.
4068534	4071815	It should be fully animated like the Lego movie or something like that.
4073136	4074857	I hear there's good writers on it.
4075197	4088284	I want to say it was the guy that did the Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre movies as well as I think they even have some folks that worked on the Lego movie in there as well.
4091546	4094207	But the trailer just sends the wrong vibes I think.
4094627	4095348	One, it looks...
4097245	4103875	The live action folks look very out of place in the actual shots.
4104016	4106980	I don't know if that's intentional or not, but it looks cheap.
4107661	4111107	And what's weird is I've seen... I mean, there's been...
4112268	4133048	So many Minecraft movies or little fan things that people have done, which is why they're calling it a Minecraft movie, not the Minecraft movie, because I think that's kind of the whole celebrating that there are a lot of folks out there that create content that are fans of it, and this is just a take from that.
4134275	4136376	My problem with it is there's a lot of things.
4137177	4138377	There are some issues with it.
4138397	4150723	So technically, just with the trailer, from the outset, all of the characters in the trailer don't seem to be interested to be in the scenarios that they are.
4150823	4161269	So for example, all of the reactions from the characters to the environment and the people inside of this are just annoyed, which...
4162637	4164278	That's not how you sell a movie.
4164498	4166959	You have to sell excitement.
4167099	4171482	You don't go, ugh, ugh, why am I, ugh, what is that?
4171902	4173583	Ugh, yo, this guy's stupid.
4174003	4175043	Ugh, like, what?
4175964	4177705	You can't sell a movie like that.
4177745	4178705	That's just stupid.
4178785	4180806	Like, why would you market a movie like that?
4182147	4188230	Outside of that, like, I have so many nitpicks, like, the technical points of it, because, you know, I play Minecraft, and I play modded Minecraft as well.
4188290	4191192	Like, the movie itself, um...
4193429	4197612	It's hard to take Minecraft and make it realistic in the first place.
4197712	4203356	Minecraft blocks are supposed to be a square meter in size, which is huge, obviously.
4203536	4211081	It doesn't make sense to be a square meter for... These kids would have to be hoisted up on the environment.
4211101	4214403	So I guess there are some creative liberties taken there.
4214883	4217685	But the size proportions are all over the place.
4217725	4218366	So you have...
4219066	4222350	Blocks that look to be about two feet square, which is fine.
4222870	4231418	Then you have the actual items that drop that are like the size of a Rubik's Cube or even smaller than that, which is just really weird.
4233140	4238585	You have things that are in this movie that are clearly not Minecraft.
4238786	4240647	You have spinning windmills.
4241806	4244028	That's not a thing that's in vanilla Minecraft.
4244529	4247031	Like, there's not that type of movement in the game.
4248112	4251436	What if it's a secret announcement, like the Wizard and Mario 3?
4251836	4253738	It is not, come on.
4254198	4254799	It's not.
4255540	4259283	The other thing too is there's a lot of focus on the piglins in this, which...
4259844	4260945	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4279239	4283583	Um, which is awful because Legends was awful and that's why it's not a game anymore.
4283683	4290489	Don't make that based around that storyline because it's, I mean, the Penguins are okay, but there's a lot of other things out there.
4290649	4293271	There's not going to be the end or the end of Dragon in this movie already.
4293771	4298235	Um, and like the rest of it, I just don't understand it.
4298275	4300457	Like Jason Momoa, why are you dressed like that?
4300817	4302058	Like, what's the point of that?
4303047	4304627	and Jack Black as Steve.
4304887	4306948	Jack Black is very excited about this role.
4307008	4308568	He's a big fan of Minecraft.
4309049	4311209	But they literally threw a blue shirt on Jack Black.
4311249	4315110	They didn't do anything to Jack Black to make him look more like the character.
4315190	4317331	They didn't do anything with it.
4317371	4319311	At the very least, it should have been animated.
4319611	4324452	Funny enough, there have been already people that have animated the whole trailer in Minecraft.
4324552	4325132	And guess what?
4325253	4325913	It looks better.
4326173	4328113	It's just... It's silly.
4328133	4329394	Yeah, I saw that in our Discord.
4329414	4330874	TigerCloud made that up.
4332580	4334202	I mean, I'm still gonna see it day one.
4334543	4348802	I am still interested to see what it is, and I don't think you can really understand the storyline with it from just a teaser trailer, but everything that they've done so far, just the vibe of that, saying, oh, well, like, all the characters are annoyed, they're like...
4349639	4351620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4369966	4371047	and then there's the art style which I
4391673	4392694	I don't know what that is.
4393174	4395335	They didn't commit either way.
4395796	4404661	And it's so funny that the guy that folks working on the movie said they didn't want it to be like Sonic the Hedgehog with the CGI.
4405461	4409144	And yet the first thing you see is a character that looks like the original Sonic.
4409304	4409564	It's like...
4411232	4411552	Why?
4411912	4412833	Why did you do that?
4412933	4414333	Like, you didn't have to do that.
4414833	4416374	They don't have to have human teeth.
4417835	4418735	Why did you do that?
4418875	4424977	I don't have the same horse in the race where, like, I don't have the same feelings about Minecraft.
4425017	4426798	I haven't invested as much in it or whatever.
4427238	4433301	But I will just say that those, the llama and the pig or whatever that was, the animals, those are the things of nightmares.
4433321	4433841	Llama and the sheep?
4434241	4435702	Those are the things with nightmares.
4435962	4437083	The sheep looks bad.
4437303	4438544	The llama looks okay.
4438744	4440025	The wolf looks good.
4440846	4442266	The piglins look good.
4443447	4446169	The ghasts, creepy, but they're always creepy.
4446189	4454155	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm going to laugh if this is a Ni No Kuni situation and the movie is actually really good, but had the trailer done by a crappy studio.
4454995	4456736	Everybody, please note the date and time.
4457076	4459337	Bobby finally admitted that Ni No Kuni is a good game.
4459557	4462218	He did it in a roundabout way, but he finally fucking did it.
4462538	4463138	We got there.
4463518	4463898	We did it.
4463918	4464739	Mission accomplished.
4464759	4467500	Got him!
4467720	4470981	No, I mean, seriously though, I am excited to see the movie.
4471481	4477143	I'm not excited that the same large content creators are the ones being showcased in these movies, but that's neither here nor there.
4479858	4488105	I just think that in general, if you're marketing a movie, it's best not to market it in a way that makes it seem like this movie's lame.
4488285	4492128	Like, don't have your characters going, ugh, I don't want to be here.
4492308	4493049	What about this, Loki?
4493089	4499734	Because there's a lot of people in chat that are bringing up the point about, you know, and I think Kotaku ran a whole article on this too, about how the movie is for kids, right?
4500155	4503457	You know, like, if you were a kid, you're probably going to view this movie in a different way.
4503517	4507140	Now, I know you have kids, but maybe I would actually say your kids are probably actually a little too old.
4507921	4509842	Yeah, they're more in that tween age.
4510803	4513805	Right, but I play Minecraft still.
4513825	4515526	I play it every single day.
4515726	4527955	Like, it's not like... And I understand... Like, why dismiss my opinion, like, in general, like Kotaku or whoever, why dismiss my opinion, you know, my nitpicks about the movie?
4528435	4532358	I think they are very valid in the sense of, like, you know...
4533631	4559057	it's you know thankfully it's not you know any like sort of like targeting gender or anything like that but we're talking like we're talking about like technical like stuff in the in the actual trailer and an adult ticket is worth more money than a child ticket exactly and well and on top of that I'm not saying that like what you're saying if you make the argument well it's targeted towards children so what you're saying that argument right there says that
4560638	4564300	We didn't invest the time to make this story good.
4564320	4566521	We just, you know, we put a little bit of effort into it.
4566541	4568022	There's just a threadbare storyline that
4579848	4581450	An Idiot Child Can Follow.
4581931	4590259	And we made sure to just have cameos of things on there because their simple minds can't understand more complex things.
4590780	4597707	Mind you that us, we grew up back in the 80s when there was a lot of
4598468	4616646	movies that just had storylines and the movies were out to scar us all remember like Return to Oz or the Never Ending Story Swamp Scene or Return to like there's so many movies that were out to like literally Gremlins that wasn't a kids movie Poltergeist
4619759	4633124	Gremlins was never a kids movie Gremlins was written for adults but they're so cute I don't think that it's fair one, you should never just dismiss your audience because they're like, well it's not targeted towards you
4634522	4645308	Well, I didn't hear no baby shark in there, and I didn't see no, like, Counteen and, you know, the... It wasn't the Teletubbies, it was Jason Momoa.
4645748	4650111	You know, if we really want to target those children, let's put all that garbage.
4650131	4652152	Where's Spider-Man or Elsa in that trailer?
4652172	4653152	Where's Skibbity Toilet?
4654333	4655313	Where's Skibbity Toilet?
4655353	4655874	Exactly.
4655994	4658815	Well, that's coming later on, you know.
4659796	4659876	And...
4660538	4660999	There you go.
4661259	4662079	Perfect example.
4662300	4665803	Michael Bay, is he targeting children for the Skivity Toilet movie?
4666043	4666784	I think not.
4666884	4671548	Like, why would you even, you know, it's an excuse is what it is.
4671668	4672289	It's an excuse.
4672449	4675512	And unfortunately, here's the thing, and I will try to wrap this up.
4676613	4677093	Here's the thing.
4677493	4677994	Mojang
4679048	4679769	and their audience.
4680249	4689917	They've had some struggles recently with capturing what the audience actually wants them to, you know, in a game that they're designing.
4690017	4694801	They go on some tangents that are just kind of out there and don't really make any sense.
4694961	4701167	And unfortunately, like, this trailer does look like it is a live action thing that they filmed for...
4702262	4703883	They're like Minecraft Live stuff.
4703923	4705984	Like, it's very cheap.
4706564	4708245	Funny enough, I think those actually look better.
4708426	4713488	Like, it's very, you know, obvious green screen, all that stuff.
4714249	4716850	But that's to say, this could also be a stylistic choice.
4716990	4718131	It could have a good story.
4718291	4719812	We don't know until we go into it.
4719912	4727456	I just hope it's not like something like the Borderlands movie where it was very threadbare and it was just rushed.
4727776	4728257	And so...
4729787	4732388	I mean, this has been in development for over a decade.
4733609	4734750	Lots of people have touched it.
4736010	4737191	So hopefully it's good.
4737211	4754120	So they don't want anything to fail, but if they don't listen to their audience and just run straight forward with whatever garbage they think that we want to see without actually listening to their audience, then you could end up with, you know, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie without the fixes.
4755148	4757650	Well, we'll find out in April when this movie comes out.
4757750	4760031	But Loki, I must say, I was expecting a lot more yelling.
4760712	4762212	Oh, one more thing.
4762433	4765154	The Sonic the Hedgehog 3 trailer came out as well.
4765575	4766835	A perfect example right there.
4767136	4770158	There is something, hey, that's weird, it's targeted towards kids.
4770358	4771038	And guess what?
4771078	4772459	The story's not bad.
4772619	4773159	And guess what?
4773179	4775361	It has interesting characters.
4775721	4778283	And the CGI doesn't look like total trash.
4778823	4785947	That's so weird that you can make a movie like that that actually respects the audience and everybody that's in there.
4785967	4786607	Because guess what?
4786947	4790629	People that played Sonic the Hedgehog, that game came out decades ago.
4791109	4793651	Do you think maybe some of the adults would want to see that as well?
4794011	4798713	Minecraft has come out over several decades ago.
4798893	4800094	I mean, 15 years, I guess.
4800314	4802095	So 15 years ago, it came out.
4803297	4805478	There's a lot of people that are grown adults now.
4806339	4809061	Do you really think that they don't deserve a good Minecraft movie?
4809521	4810221	Like, come on.
4810381	4811502	Don't make excuses for them.
4811662	4815004	Dear movie writers, go back and watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.
4816225	4816585	The end.
4817666	4817946	Alright.
4818615	4821976	Well, we're going to move on and talk about other types of movies on YouTube.
4822176	4826177	And Nintendo sometimes gets involved with their own policies.
4826217	4830078	You might remember some time ago they had a whole program where they were going to demonetize.
4830298	4831599	Well, that's all long gone.
4831719	4837181	But they have announced some new guidelines for folks that are going to be making YouTubes.
4837781	4839121	And they are as follows.
4839261	4841722	You are not allowed to do, quote,
4842202	4848643	content containing actions that may be considered to impair the gameplay experience in multiplayer and modes.
4849123	4850384	That behavior is now banned.
4851084	4857665	And Nintendo reserves the right to no longer allow the use of Nintendo game content if violations are found.
4858125	4860145	Those are the two big changes this time around.
4860625	4862226	But honestly, like, I gotta be honest.
4862266	4868427	I look at this and I go, okay, so Nintendo doesn't want you doing these, like, multiplayer trolling things in their games.
4868467	4869147	Like, I actually...
4870367	4872588	I can't sit here and go, that's unreasonable.
4872788	4873449	I hate that.
4873749	4876990	There's going to be a certain audience on YouTube that does say, that's not fair.
4877050	4880292	You're taking away our freedom of speech and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4880552	4883433	Well, you're free to do whatever pranks you want.
4883453	4885895	Nintendo just doesn't want their products associated with it.
4886335	4893878	And until YouTube changes their guidelines, which I don't think they're going to until copyright law changes, you're going to have to sit and spin.
4894519	4896260	They're going to claim parody.
4896360	4896800	Yeah.
4897060	4898781	Well, can it...
4900097	4907025	Then the question's going to be, and it depends how far Nintendo's lawyers want to take this, and Nintendo's lawyers often want to take... Although, I don't know.
4907045	4908126	You get into property rights.
4908506	4912110	I've given up on PAL World and that whole thing.
4912210	4916194	I thought for sure we would have seen something Nintendo happen with that now, but apparently...
4916875	4921339	Maybe it is enough percentage of parody where Nintendo has realized they can't do anything about it.
4921879	4922240	I don't know.
4922860	4932768	But I can say that YouTube copyright strikes do not often side with the creator, but they side with the copyright holder.
4933068	4937092	And if Nintendo decides to make your YouTube channels life hell, they can make it happen.
4938055	4940056	Whether you call it this or that.
4940917	4948601	And if you're trolling people in Nintendo games, I can see where they're like, you know what, we don't want our brand associated with that.
4948761	4952483	What this tells me, there's somebody they want to go after.
4954030	4971744	and they're gonna soon so if that is your uh if that is your MMO is uh you know MO or whatever is making uh trolly your MMO sorry uh obviously my brain sucks today if your MO is making um trolly Nintendo things then just you know look out
4972734	4976337	Also, if you're making that kind of content now, what year is it, really?
4977258	4977979	Come on, guys.
4978319	4980701	Grow the fuck up.
4980921	4983243	That's some pretty weak content right there.
4983283	4983963	Yeah, yeah.
4984744	4987606	And I also kind of go, well, how can you troll people in Nintendo games?
4987647	4990729	That would mean that it has to have robust online support.
4992891	4996074	Yeah, I mean, the handful of games that probably have that.
4996534	4996694	Yeah.
4997575	4997795	Anyway.
4998323	5004046	TigerClaw says, I'm sure Nintendo will go after YouTubers having Nintendo characters doing and saying inappropriate things.
5004226	5004767	Oh, I'm sure.
5005327	5005707	I'm sure.
5006227	5006668	Absolutely.
5007788	5007988	All right.
5008008	5008569	Well, moving on.
5008609	5009069	DarkSakura.
5010872	5016798	Well, I have some opinions about this, but I'm overall kind of happy about it.
5018079	5029791	SNK announced ACA Neo Geo Selection Volume 1 and Volume 2 for Switch, both to be released on December 12th in Japan for 5,940 yen each.
5034494	5038135	So about 50 bucks around there.
5039175	5044757	They will have 10 games that were also previously released digitally as ACA Neo Geo titles.
5046557	5051999	The orders are up on Amazon Japan and by camera as well.
5053139	5060401	The titles in the first one are Baseball Stars Professional, Fatal Fury 2, or Garou Densetsu 2.
5063421	5089966	Ghost Pilots, Metal Slug 4, Mutation Nation, Neo Turf Masters, Samurai Shodown, or Samurai Spirits Shock Troopers, Second Squad, Sticks Winner 2, King of Fighters 95 and then the second one is Alpha Mission 2, Garou, Mark of the Wolves Metal Slug X, Riding Hero, Samurai Shodown 5, Savage Rain, Shock Troopers, King of Fighters 94 Top Hunter, Roddy and Kathy, and Top Players Golf
5092708	5094816	Why can't you just take the good ones and put them on one game?
5098402	5121774	of course that's subjective but I mean it's a really good collection I mean the the ones in there that I'm I would say most interested in um I mean I've got a bajillion copies of Summer Showdown I have it on Neo Geo but Summer Showdown 5 would be fun to have as well as the Metal Slug games um I've got Garou Mark of the Wolves on Dreamcast um but that would also be fun
5122834	5129934	I'm a little disappointed to not see either of the Last Blade titles in here I love Last Blade
5132666	5158526	but I mean Shock Troopers in there as well I mean I freaking love Shock Troopers and the King of Fighters games although why King of Fighters 2000 isn't in there because that is like I'd say probably among the best of the King of Fighters games I think some of it could be also because the Arcade Archives has tons of games and some of them might be piecemealed already I'm not sure what is and isn't available as a standalone I was just seeing what my preference would have been yeah I know I get it I get it so
5160201	5178070	all hope may not be lost if you're looking for some of those games it just might cost you more that's the bummer yeah maybe a few hundred dollars for buying a cartridge yeah yeah all right uh let's move on Loki yeah so uh Sony seems to have um
5179420	5180621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5204058	5211740	However, they announced in their blog on the 5th, Sony did, that they're celebrating the 30 years of PlayStation.
5212500	5216421	And in that, there's a graphic that says, you know, PlayStation 30th anniversary.
5216501	5223742	And it has the PlayStation logo, including the, you know, triangle, circle, X, or cross and square.
5224262	5227343	And those images are made up of...
5228363	5251729	Silhouettes of different consoles and peripherals and one of those appears to be the PlayStation 5 Pro because the PlayStation 5 Pro had these diagonal grills on the side of the console and it is clearly visible actually right next to the PlayStation logo itself on the blog post image.
5252149	5256070	It's also on Instagram as well in the circle on the right hand side.
5257199	5260400	So I guess that does confirm that that is what the console looks like.
5260900	5269543	So assuming that this is going to be starting here, I think this week is when they're going to start announcing all the different things for the... Oh, I'm sorry.
5269563	5274544	Yeah, PlayStation tournaments are going to do those the 21st through the 22nd.
5275404	5278165	But there's going to be some other things, I think, happening leading up to that.
5278245	5280206	So maybe we'll get an announcement here very soon.
5281294	5290879	Yeah, rumors are in the next couple weeks and you know, Apple's got a big thing tomorrow, you know, this could be an interesting week of tech announcements.
5291340	5296303	I don't remember September outside of the Apple thing which is usually like clockwork the week after Labor Day.
5296663	5300325	I'm trying to think about like other tech companies doing their announcements.
5301553	5302514	Tokyo Game Show?
5302574	5304755	Oh, right, of course, Tokyo Game Show.
5306256	5307597	I think that's towards the end of the month.
5307617	5311399	I'd have to look up the actual dates, but maybe you're right.
5311419	5314040	It is September 26th through the 29th.
5314120	5317042	Yeah, so that could be that it's going to be timed with Tokyo Game Show.
5318002	5318903	That would make a lot of sense.
5320764	5327527	Let's actually, if we can, DarkSakura, if you're prepared to do it, let's skip to your story next because it's actually a little closer to what Loki just talked about.
5327567	5328688	It makes more sense to go to that.
5330231	5330772	Sure, I guess.
5332893	5340760	So, Sony did share some early glimpses at their 30th anniversary plans.
5340900	5344943	I mean, you know, Loki was bringing up the PS5 Pro.
5347766	5350528	Some of the other stuff that's going on is that, first of all, there was...
5351969	5364602	the Astrobots central hub where the bots that you've saved you can make them dance in like a little lobby area with the 30th anniversary logo.
5366084	5374192	There's also My First Gran Turismo which is a trial version to I guess attract people to Gran Turismo 7.
5375794	5388093	um there's also digital game soundtracks for uh looks like God of War, God of War 2, God of War Ghost of Sparta, Twisted Metal, Starhawk, Warhawk and Unit 13 um
5392357	5415602	there's also then Shapes of Play there are three different kinds of products there is the Shape of Play Battle which is a board game that you can challenge your friend to line up four different shapes of the same color on the board to win I don't know, is that like Go?
5415962	5416402	or something.
5416722	5416983	Anyway.
5418683	5426647	Shapes of Play Create that's magnetic blocks that you position to make drawings or stuff.
5426727	5428688	I used to do these when I was a kid with wood blocks.
5430289	5436752	Shapes of Play Recharge where you can, as I say, experience a new way to recharge between games.
5437853	5439734	They look like squishy toys, I think.
5440074	5440294	Anyway.
5442553	5454121	Those will launch in December 2024 through direct.playstation.com in US, UK, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Benelux.
5456163	5461007	The pre-orders are also starting today through PlayStation Direct.
5462188	5473341	and then not to mention the free online multiplayer weekend September 21st to 22nd and it looks like that's going to be FC24, NBA 2K25 and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
5478648	5479468	from the looks of it.
5479989	5503610	There are going to be some tournaments in the games I mentioned before as well as Tekken 8 and Guilty Gear Strive and other sports titles and avatars that are just a full-on black and white PlayStation 30th anniversary and then another with the colors from the PlayStation logo with like a
5504711	5510137	The button symbol items on the background behind it saying PlayStation 30th anniversary.
5510637	5518506	And it just occurred to me that the colors from the PlayStation are very similar to the colors for the Super Famicom.
5520151	5523053	Different shade of green, but that blue, yellow, and red?
5523453	5523714	Yeah.
5524234	5524954	Very similar.
5525175	5526716	Well, you know, with the history and all.
5527096	5529558	But it's interesting they didn't distance it further, you know?
5529678	5532820	It's fresh in my head because I literally just did my business cards.
5533260	5533601	Oh, funny.
5533741	5537643	And I sampled the same colors from that Thoma composter.
5538064	5538344	Oh, funny.
5539622	5539942	All right.
5540443	5542524	Well, it sounds like they got a lot kind of going on there.
5542624	5546587	And of course, it just, you know, has that moment of, oh, the PlayStation is turning 30.
5547768	5548569	How old am I?
5548809	5549749	You know, that whole thing.
5550630	5552511	But it sounds like they got a lot of fun stuff going on.
5552531	5555053	So it almost seems like for sure they'll do more announcements.
5555954	5561298	How I didn't have worse motion sickness playing through Jumping Flash that many times.
5563526	5580469	but you know the original PlayStation gave us actually I take that back I think it was the Saturn it was either PlayStation or Saturn version I don't remember but in Toshinden there was the the monkey and when he won he did the butt monkey dance so he was the butt monkey
5581798	5582158	All right.
5582298	5586642	Well, maybe maybe when you win in this fighting game, you'll do a butt monkey dance.
5586802	5590384	But it's the Capcom fighting game collections we were talking about earlier in the show.
5590444	5594728	And I mentioned that Xbox is going to be happening, but it's a little bit different.
5594768	5600712	That's because when these games were first announced, both the Marvel versus Capcom fighting collection, which I think is out next week.
5601453	5603114	Yeah, September 12th for most people.
5603734	5624885	and then Capcom Fighting Collection 2 which was just announced we haven't heard anything about what is going to happen with Xbox but we got some clarity on that this week and we know that Capcom will be releasing Xbox One version notice that's Xbox One versions not series but I'm assuming that of course the series will play the Xbox One of course as it does most of the games there
5625925	5638108	So they announced in an update, Capcom, that we are excited to announce that after technical discussions with our partners at Microsoft, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 will release on Xbox One.
5638568	5641428	Both versions will arrive in 2025.
5641908	5643469	So there will be a little bit of a wait.
5644269	5649430	But again, if you're looking forward to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, you can get that on PS4.
5650390	5652792	Switch, and PC on September 12th.
5653153	5656316	You can get a physical edition on November 22nd.
5656376	5663022	Capcom Fighting Collection 2 is already going to be in 2025, so maybe we'll get a little closer to the actual date there.
5663763	5668267	If you were not already aware of what is coming out in Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection...
5668627	5669348	Gonna take you for a ride
5686830	5687670	and The Punisher.
5688071	5699595	Those are all the games that will be in that collection that is out next week if you're buying it digitally, which I imagine most people are probably just going to go ahead and pick that up unless you're really big on the physical collection stuff, which maybe some of you are.
5701295	5701575	All right.
5702076	5705657	Well, Loki, let's go to a game that never ends.
5705717	5706677	And boy, it makes me happy.
5707658	5707858	Yep.
5708498	5714160	So No Man's Sky has added yet another update, the Aquarius update.
5714720	5716281	And in it, it adds fishing.
5717352	5718713	because everybody loves fishing.
5718793	5721415	Everyone does fishing in Animal Crossing.
5721876	5722756	They do fishing.
5723757	5725098	Yeah, everything.
5725598	5726699	Every game has fishing in it now.
5726719	5728701	You know what they didn't add with a name like that?
5728761	5734085	They did not add, this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius.
5734425	5735186	It could have been the trailer.
5735246	5735446	What?
5735766	5735946	What?
5736006	5737067	Minecraft got the Beatles?
5737468	5738068	Like, why can't we?
5738809	5739089	Come on.
5740871	5744834	Yeah, I'm sure that was well worth the money for that trailer.
5746055	5750839	No, but yeah, it's going to be, they have lots of different fish you can catch.
5751640	5756564	You know, you can actually fish off of your spacecraft as well, which is really cool.
5758385	5760647	You can create your own diving suit.
5761047	5768914	They have a catalog for the fish that you catch, as well as a special Aquarius fishing expedition or expeditions, maybe.
5770970	5772051	So yeah, very exciting.
5772151	5782660	Once again, this is a game that came out years ago and they are still providing... Got dunked on by the entire internet and all these years later out of pure spite, they have continued.
5782860	5784801	And I can appreciate that, to be honest.
5784821	5788084	I applaud them for spite-based motivations.
5788184	5790446	Actually, quite the opposite of spite in all seriousness with this.
5790546	5795330	I don't know if you heard, do you know where the inspiration for this update came from, actually?
5795630	5799554	Sean Murray, I think, mentioned it, is that there's actually a piece of fan art
5800154	5806977	that showed a traveler fishing off the side of the ship into the ocean like it was just a fan art somebody did.
5807357	5810679	And Sean Murray or somebody at Hello Games saw that and went, you know what?
5811379	5811699	Yeah.
5812399	5813060	We can do that.
5813180	5813520	Yeah.
5814200	5814940	Yeah.
5815221	5819242	If I were to guess, and this is probably a little bit more like, oh, that makes sense.
5819623	5822324	I mean, they have a new game coming out, right?
5822664	5824705	That game probably has fishing in it.
5825672	5826753	I hope so.
5827094	5827895	Hey, this works here.
5828135	5829536	Let's build this and bring it over.
5829556	5832139	Does this mean I should finally play my copy of the game?
5832239	5832960	You really should.
5833040	5833881	I love the game.
5834041	5839147	Although, well, no, I was going to say you can switch between first person and over the shoulder and you can even do it in the spaceship.
5840168	5841810	Because you can do third person spaceship too.
5841890	5843331	So, actually, you should be fine with it.
5843792	5845474	So, yeah, you should play it.
5846527	5846827	It's fun.
5847207	5850189	And you can turn off, if you don't want to fight things, just turn it off.
5851350	5852451	I don't want to fight things.
5852591	5853992	I just want to explore.
5854692	5855633	I just want to explore.
5855953	5857013	Yeah, that's the best part.
5858054	5861036	That's why I miss playing Star Trek Online.
5861776	5865519	Except I left my character parked at Quarks and would just play there for hours.
5866459	5868701	You said you already have a copy of the game, Jamie?
5868861	5869021	Yeah.
5869830	5873860	Okay, because they say if you don't, 60% off until September 9th.
5874301	5875224	So that's till tomorrow.
5875244	5876687	I got it after they re-released it.
5876988	5877249	Nice.
5878291	5878552	All right.
5879341	5887228	Well, another game that's probably in some of your backlogs that you need to catch up on, I think, is Baldur's Gate 3, which we talked about earlier.
5887629	5894215	Now, while I was doing this awesome voice acting panel, and not just me, actually.
5894275	5896997	The Baldur's Gate crew was doing a panel every day.
5897358	5900481	Garrett Wong interviewed them on Friday, which I thought was really funny.
5900761	5904644	By the way, for those of you that know the history of this show, you're going to find this funny.
5905425	5913209	I run into Garrett Wong in the halls of DragonCon, as sometimes people do, and I looked him right in the eye and said, hey, Garrett, how was Curacao?
5914349	5922854	And he looks back at me and he goes, oh, yeah, yeah, Curacao, wow, people remember that that was the thing, yeah, great, it was great, thanks, and walked on by to his stand.
5922894	5929537	He doesn't fucking remember watching me fucking, I could, I literally almost died in front of Garrett Wong and he forgot.
5929557	5929637	Yeah.
5931704	5933105	He probably saves people all the time.
5933165	5933425	I know.
5933985	5935406	And still won't fucking get promoted.
5937007	5939408	This is why you're not getting promoted, sir.
5939428	5940229	It's because of your memory.
5940349	5940829	No, I'm just kidding.
5941389	5942550	I'm the last one to complain.
5942590	5943170	I'm just kidding.
5943430	5944051	Look, I get it.
5944151	5944511	I get it.
5945131	5945952	Busy, con.
5946052	5951855	I caught him in between point A to B. Not the greatest time to talk to somebody, but I had to take my shot.
5952235	5956257	I had to ask him, and he didn't fucking remember me almost dying in front of him.
5956437	5956898	That's fine.
5957018	5957438	That's fine.
5957738	5959419	I'll have to just try again sometime.
5960840	5961140	All right.
5962193	5964455	Anyway, in all seriousness, let's go back to Baldur's Gate 3.
5965036	5969000	While I was doing that panel and other folks, you know, DragonCon were doing PAX...
5971219	5986325	Patch 7 is coming out this week for Baldur's Gate and it is going to be making mods official.
5986926	5991968	It is through an official mod.io powered so it's running through that site.
5992588	5994769	Mod Manager will work with this.
5995876	6010522	Larian does say we're not going to prevent modding outside of our own official pipeline but only the approved mods will be targeted for stability and cross-platform compatibility so I'm sorry if you have salacious nudie mods
6011222	6017148	Those are not going to be, you can have them, but Larian doesn't want to touch them and put them in the game and make sure they're cross platform.
6017648	6020431	Other things maybe will be there.
6021191	6028778	Larian also says it'll ensure a smoother experience at the cost of more script focused modding, which can still be done outside of our pipeline.
6029159	6029999	So that's pretty cool.
6030880	6031720	Um, so check that out.
6032160	6035821	Um, Mac will also be getting patch seven, but that won't be out until October.
6035881	6037261	There's just a little bit of a delay there.
6037881	6044823	Uh, cross platform save compatibility will also release in October when every device gets that patch.
6044903	6049384	It might be consoles are actually getting that in October as well, but I believe PC is getting it this week.
6049444	6051044	So you can kind of jump in and check that out.
6051704	6054785	Um, and I'm sure a lot of people very excited to do that.
6055305	6055385	Um,
6057023	6058023	Not DLC.
6058123	6060104	This is just, you know, extra stuff.
6060544	6062984	Very similar to the game we were just talking about, No Man's Sky.
6063445	6065965	I'm sure that makes a lot of people very, very happy.
6066825	6067065	All right.
6067185	6070686	Before we get into our next segment, we usually get into the classic game of the week here.
6071066	6073527	I have a little bit of housekeeping that's a little bit strange.
6074207	6078788	So we keep a log of the classic game of the week.
6079428	6085910	And pretty much every episode the show has ever done has been kept by fans on our Orange Launch Radio wiki.
6086750	6087250	DarkTetsuya
6109265	6129245	uh loyal and brave and probably the most frequent contributor to the wiki alongside with Orange Rite I think did a lot too has actually filed an appeal uh to figure out what the hell's going on so my hope is that fandom will bring it back at least we were able to download archives you can download everything so if it doesn't come back
6130472	6131273	Yeah, fandom's kind of, eh.
6157512	6158333	So here's the thing.
6158473	6159614	I'm going to give them one chance.
6160435	6163659	If they don't bring the wiki back, we'll do it somewhere else.
6163939	6169906	I don't want to volunteer something because a lot of the web work is on Bobby to do.
6170306	6172909	So if it's a lot of work, I don't want to volunteer him to do it.
6173290	6175012	But if it's something where we can like...
6175945	6180589	Unpack a wiki shell on the server somewhere and let you guys turn you loose, then great.
6180649	6181469	I think that would be awesome.
6181770	6184232	But if that's not possible, then there's alternatives I've heard about.
6184252	6184812	We'll look into that.
6184852	6187174	It sounds like a lot of you aren't big fans of fandom anyway.
6187534	6191317	So here's their one chance to not burn this fucking bridge forever.
6192218	6193219	You hear me, fandom?
6193639	6194560	Don't burn this bridge.
6195633	6211506	Yeah, I want to say that the Minecraft wiki, which was originally on Fandom, moved off of Fandom several months ago because it was bad as far as stuff being broken all the time, ads, malware, stuff like that.
6212347	6217368	Alright, well we'll see what happens, but yes, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki for now is down.
6217809	6220489	So unfortunately this game will not be able to get tracked today.
6220729	6222210	You'll have to use pen and paper.
6222790	6226391	You'll have to open a OneNote notebook or something else.
6226971	6235053	Or, I don't know, maybe we keep a log on Discord somewhere, but we'll have to just note this somewhere else until we hopefully get the Wiki back in the next week.
6235094	6236534	Because if not, fandom.
6236914	6237875	The classic game page.
6238155	6238676	I know, I know.
6238696	6240338	So we'll try to get that restored somewhere.
6241379	6245523	But just a heads up, that's a difficulty we're dealing with right now.
6245843	6246124	All right.
6246904	6254092	So anyway, let's move on to our classic game of the week segment with, of course, the bumper.
6264918	6272221	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6272681	6275642	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6275842	6283645	Alright, but once a month DarkSakura likes to put a twist on this segment and do a classic cancelled game.
6283805	6287426	One that we never actually got to play, but the proof exists out there.
6287726	6290167	DarkSakura, what is the classic cancelled game of the month?
6291788	6292448	Oh, the...
6293584	6307008	You know, and I did mention the Dreamcast earlier, which I think would be absolutely, you know, it's not one of the best systems that ever was, but the game I picked was called Propeller Arena Aviation Battle Championship.
6308749	6315211	It was originally called Propellerhead Online, and it was meant to be released on September 19th, 2001.
6315251	6315871	Let the date sink in.
6320307	6329315	The game was trademarked on April 14th, 2001, developed and completed by Sega AM2, but the game never got an official release.
6329916	6330757	It was cancelled.
6331838	6332839	Why was it cancelled?
6332919	6334020	Anyone want to hazard a guess?
6337643	6337944	Anyone?
6339365	6341487	It was right after the September 11th attacks.
6342990	6371009	so they were citing similarities in the game packaging and design as the events and the Dreamcast declining market share so it was on display at E3 on May 19, 2001 and it was postponed to work on the cover art and tweak some of those images out of and I mean
6373027	6380731	They wanted to port it to another system, but never did, and the disc image of the game did eventually get leaked.
6381871	6392256	So, basically, there's an air combat tournament in 2045 using planes from the World War II era, and you participate in the tournament.
6393857	6396358	It is basically dogfight deathmatches.
6397409	6398769	You have four modes.
6398909	6401950	You have Championship, where you have a sequence of dogfights.
6402530	6403871	Quick Battle, which is a single.
6404291	6407152	Training Arena, where you learn you have minigames.
6407252	6408632	And then the Network to play online.
6409812	6414714	When you beat the game or training levels, you get other characters and levels.
6415694	6419575	And it had forced feedback via the Dreamcast Jump Pack.
6421085	6429590	The soundtrack had elements of punk rock, and it was created by both branches of Sega.
6429670	6433652	The Japanese team had 13 songs composed and produced in-house.
6434273	6444499	An American team worked with Fat Wreck Chords label to license nine songs from Consumed, Zero Dawn, No Use for a Name, Mad Caddies, and Rise Against.
6445919	6455462	and some of Sega's original songs that did get remixed as instrumentals and reused in Virtua Tennis 3 that came out in 2006.
6459783	6461763	That's really all I can say about the game.
6461843	6463104	It's actually a complete game.
6463144	6464824	You can find the disc image out there.
6470465	6472886	If you play it, let me know how you like it.
6475817	6476758	Shameless Cats.
6477198	6478098	That would be my team.
6478839	6479279	There it is.
6479519	6480720	Propeller Arena.
6481420	6482521	The classic game of the week.
6483382	6483742	All right.
6484322	6487084	Lots of people in chat giving their opinions on that as well.
6487664	6488145	Fun fun.
6489986	6490446	All right.
6491987	6499091	Let's get back to some news that we're going to cover real fast in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
6500472	6501693	Loki, we'll go to you and start.
6504704	6505662	Loki, you're muted, just heads up
6506820	6507540	This is kind of fun.
6507760	6514704	In the vein of the Commodore 64 Mini, we have now the Spectrum Mini.
6515544	6521667	So the Spectrum Mini is a console I'm not too familiar with because I never really got to play a ZX Spectrum.
6521807	6529690	But this new mini console does actually emulate the ZX Spectrum, the 48 and the 128 models.
6529710	6530711	It's got 48 games built in.
6535833	6560994	and includes even um well they have like the hobbit maniac miner head over heels as well as even some homebrew games in there as well a bunch of different you know options that you would expect with like one of these consoles including you know the crt filters the 4x3 aspect ratio um you can also load a usb drive with roms and play them in there as well
6561839	6569885	It even includes, I think this is kind of one of the coolest parts about it, is a 32-page Crash magazine, a mini-mag.
6570105	6575789	It has, like, reviews from the older games, I guess, original game reviews and stuff.
6576269	6577590	So I think that's pretty cool as well.
6577610	6579151	Does it have programs you can type in, too?
6581074	6588402	I don't know, but it's got a full keyboard that's replicated from the original console, so pretty cool.
6588422	6594469	It's supposed to be coming out on November 22nd, so keep an eye on that.
6596451	6603813	And then, speaking of old things that are new again, we have a NES version of a Rugrats game coming out.
6603973	6604573	Yes, I know.
6604673	6605373	What year is it?
6606233	6611675	Rugrats Adventures in Game Land is an old yet new game.
6611895	6614676	It's launching on all the consoles.
6615836	6618597	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC.
6619217	6623978	Xbox One, Xbox Series will be coming, I think, a little bit later.
6624678	6634547	but this week though on the 10th is when they'll be launching there I hear actually on Epic Game Store I believe this game is going to be free as one of their games that's going to be coming out I looked today
6635871	6658509	so that's pretty cool and yeah they even have on the modern console versions they're going to have an HD overlay as well that makes the game look like the cartoon yeah you can play it as NES and it looks kind of like DuckTales Remastered sort of thing where like you can well in DuckTales Remastered you can flip back and forth maybe like Wonder Boy the trap that one
6659420	6659640	Yeah.
6660160	6660700	Dragon's Trap.
6660881	6668063	I still think it's pretty cool, though, because, like, I remember, like, back in the Nintendo days and stuff, it's like, we wouldn't necessarily go, oh, it's a Rugrats game.
6668123	6674205	It would be like, you know, a lot of those, like, tie-in games were pretty good.
6674405	6676966	Like, the games based off TV shows and stuff.
6677006	6681107	Like, remember, like, oh, Real Monsters, and, like, they had the Simpsons games and stuff like that.
6681128	6685169	I mean, some of the Simpsons games weren't so good, but, you know, some of the games were good.
6686649	6688130	But, yeah, this is exciting, so...
6688973	6689273	DarkSakura.com
6705555	6722223	I do indeed so um Konami is saying stay tuned uh with uh information for Metal Gear Solid 4 um this is for the remaster of Silent uh I said Silent Hill didn't I?
6722523	6723463	Metal Gear Solid 4 um
6726201	6735745	There was a conversation with Okamura Noriaki, who is the Konami producer for all the Metal Gear Solid stuff.
6736946	6744449	And he said that they are aware of the situation where Metal Gear Solid 4 is not playable on current platforms.
6744909	6750692	And he hinted that the game might be included in the yet-to-be-announced Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2.
6752681	6753682	I'll read the exact quote.
6753782	6756443	We definitely are aware of the situation with MGS4.
6756583	6761946	Unfortunately, we can't really say too much at the moment with Volume 1 containing Metal Gear Solid 1 through 3 dot dot dot.
6762306	6763947	You can probably connect the dots.
6764487	6771810	Right now, we still are internally concerned about what we should be doing for the future of the series.
6772250	6775172	So sorry, we can't really reveal anything to you at the moment, but stay tuned.
6776391	6779233	There's going to be those acid games that were on PSP at some point too.
6779494	6781735	I'm sure could round out a collection like that.
6781836	6783117	So be interesting.
6784077	6784538	Possibly.
6785404	6805497	Alright, well, unfortunately in sadder news, and really this actually is the last story we have slotted tonight, even though it's rapid-fire news, but on a sad note, Andrew C. Greenberg, who was the co-creator of the series Wizardry, which of course is an infamous series of RPGs, unfortunately passed away at the age of 67.
6805978	6811801	This news was shared to Facebook by his collaborator from the Wizardry days, Robert Woodhead.
6813402	6841415	obviously huge influence on RPGs especially in that early PC era I believe this game was remade just recently Digital Eclipse did a very recent remaster of the first game so if you haven't experienced this game you can do it in classic form or in this more modern form with what Digital Eclipse put out so very sad to hear that he has passed but obviously the legacy lives on which you know
6842458	6843639	Wizardry was huge in this.
6843699	6856045	By the way, if you want to know some of the inspiration, a tweet in 2022 written by Yuji Horii, the creator of Dragon Quest, has cited Wizardry as primary inspiration.
6856085	6864810	And in that tweet, talked about meeting Robert Woodhead for the first time, saying, when I think back, it all started 40 years ago when I really got into Wizardry.
6865110	6868472	So you have that game to thank an awful lot.
6869533	6870033	Rest in peace.
6871144	6878311	Okay, let's travel around the world real quick and check out some release dates of maybe some new games that Wizardry has inspired or otherwise.
6878932	6880554	Let's start in the U.S., Loki.

7039100	7040121	Funko Fusion.
7040221	7040741	Oh, that's right.
7040761	7041362	That's coming out.
7041702	7045346	On PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
7046967	7048709	Hope that one doesn't suck, but...
7050492	7052973	Alright, let's head over to Japan and check out the releases there.
7052993	7054533	We had a really busy week last week.
7054753	7060775	It's slowing down a little bit this week, but we still got quite a bit that's coming out this week on the Switch in Japan.
7060815	7063876	We have the Turrican Anthology Volume 1 and Volume 2.
7064436	7068277	I didn't realize there was this much Turrican that had been released.
7068557	7068757	Oh yeah.
7069457	7095332	but yeah, Turrican Volume 1 has Turrican 1 and 2 for the Amiga, Super Turrican and the Director's Cut for Super Nintendo and Mega Turrican Score Attack for the Genesis Volume 2 has Turrican 3 for the Amiga, Mega Turrican for the Genesis and Director's Cut Super Turrican 2 and Super Turrican 1 Score Attack both on the Super Nintendo If you didn't think you could, you sure Turrican this week on the Nintendo Switch
7096432	7097353	You were waiting for that.
7097433	7097833	I was.
7097873	7098974	I've been sitting all night on that joke.
7099034	7099294	All right.
7100155	7105198	Brave Dungeon W Pack in regular and limited edition is also coming out.
7105838	7110321	I'm not sure exactly what this game is, but it looks a little bit like an old school dungeon crawler type of game.
7110341	7114985	It looks like it might be cute and something like up my alley because it also has puzzle elements in it for whatever reason.
7115045	7116165	So I'm always down with that.
7116546	7117526	So you can check that out.
7118247	7125972	That is also going to be released alongside a game called Tenshei no Uta Collection in a regular and special edition.
7126572	7128114	all out this week on the Switch.
7128234	7135562	Meanwhile, on the PlayStation 5, we have... Ooh, Test Drive Unlimited, Solar Crown is out this week.
7135622	7141569	The Test Drive series, somehow still not killed off by a bunch of mediocre releases over the years.
7142009	7142389	Maybe...
7142970	7144831	Just maybe this one will break the curse.
7145191	7147013	It does look nice in screenshots, I will say.
7147393	7149774	We'll see how that looks when it actually comes out.
7150215	7156278	But, you know, speaking of like the spectrum and games I was playing in the Commodore 64 era, the original test drive was one of them.
7156739	7159180	So that is out on the PlayStation 5 this week.
7160441	7161982	Let's check out Europe, DarkSakura.
7163983	7179796	In Europe, we have on September 9th, which is already, I think, September 9th now in the UK, Warhammer 40k Space Marines 2 for PC, PS5, Xbox, Vampire the Masquerade on the 10th.

7374756	7378839	Speaking of casting a Frank Stone, we're going to say goodbye to you in a minute here.
7378919	7383503	And you're going to actually be streaming that game tonight, if I remember right, instead of the usual Dead by Daylight.
7384444	7385244	If it plays well.
7385464	7386045	Yeah.
7386125	7387366	Tell us a little bit about this game.
7387846	7388587	What to look forward to.
7389267	7399835	Well, it's a super massive game set in... Well, the thing with Dead by Daylight is that it touches different universes or different versions of universes and everything.
7400856	7401116	So...
7403354	7428663	you can um it starts with like a little bit of time travel and story and you were i mean every i'm sure people who care have seen the demo by now where you play the police officer rescuing the baby um from frank stone um and then it's what happened to frank stone where is he where's the spirits things like that and and how does the entity play into all of this
7429881	7432924	Dead by Daylight for the game to still make sense, right?
7432944	7433024	Yeah.
7433044	7433124	Cool.
7449926	7476780	alright well with that then I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up we're not getting a lot of questions but that's okay we've had a pretty good show long enough tonight so we'll wrap it up so well actually wait let me check in real quick with Loki if there's any last minute stories not really the only story is there's a rumor that Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed again but when is that not a thing yeah
7478756	7481118	Wake me when it actually is sitting on a shelf somewhere.
7484121	7484801	It might be a while.
7484861	7485502	I mean, whatever.
7485662	7490506	That's a game that I just... Take your time.
7490967	7491607	I don't really care.
7491727	7492388	Yeah, get it right.
7492468	7493169	Don't fuck it up.
7493409	7493829	Get it right.
7494330	7494670	I get it.
7495905	7502312	Alright, well with that then, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought and all that stuff, but I do want to thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
7502352	7505014	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, help us spread the word.
7505054	7508558	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7508898	7515725	So a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify, wherever you found this show, those go an awful long way.
7515765	7517727	We really appreciate that, but of course, tell a friend.
7517807	7519129	Word of mouth is always the best.
7519629	7545111	and hopefully we'll see you at a convention be it DragonCon, TwitchCon or otherwise in the future I actually did see a couple listeners at DragonCon I forgot to give shoutouts earlier but it was great to see folks so yeah it's always lovely and if anyone runs into me at TwitchCon say hi and I take affection in the form of chocolate you can pay tribute that way this is true by the way 100% this is true so
7546932	7548072	I demand tribute.
7548712	7548932	Kidding.
7549492	7552193	And especially the fancier and more imported, the better.
7553353	7555454	Yeah, it has to be extra imported.
7556674	7557014	What was it?
7557174	7560494	It has to go through several countries and illicit bank accounts.
7560534	7561915	What was that place in Chicago I went to?
7561995	7562575	Vossages?
7562775	7563375	Vossages.
7563395	7563855	Vossages.
7564455	7566936	Yeah, that was some expensive stuff, but it was good.
7567176	7567556	It was good.
7567676	7569256	I get why you have a taste for it.
7569356	7571256	Well, you know me.
7571856	7574617	Well, it's the same thing I applied to alcoholism.
7575734	7577996	I'm not an alcoholic because I have expensive taste.
7578056	7578496	Oh, yeah.
7578716	7581298	I only drink tequila that is over a certain price.
7581339	7581819	That's for sure.
7582239	7582499	All right.
7582539	7586643	Anyway, let's wrap up and say goodnight.
7586743	7589625	So, DarkSakura, I know you're going to be streaming your game tonight, so I'll let you go.
7589645	7593328	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
7595690	7598452	I need like five more hours per day that I can use for napping.
7600054	7600494	I hear that.
7601502	7601842	Alright.
7602402	7602963	Good night, Jamie.
7602983	7603643	Have a good stream.
7603923	7604163	Bye.
7604743	7605424	Thanks, bye.
7605984	7608805	Alright, well, Loki, we'll go to you and what's your final thought tonight?
7610766	7612806	Um... I have a lot of work to do.
7613767	7614607	And I don't want to do work.
7617147	7640126	my final thought tonight is I can't believe I just got back from DragonCon and now I'm like in Seattle in less than two weeks because unfortunately when you all are at TwitchCon I'm in Seattle for an Ingress related thing but it's gonna be fun I'm not you know I'm not sorry I'm sorry not sorry it'll be fun but I'm sad to miss TwitchCon especially in a year when a lot of y'all are going I think you'll all have a good time so I'm excited for you
7641366	7643747	I didn't hear his show, but is Bobby going?
7643767	7647289	Because I know they're doing the Game Sun Quick X or whatever.
7647309	7649350	Bobby will not be going to TwitchCon after all.
7649550	7650610	Yeah, I know.
7650951	7656173	No, I think he was not able to get to TwitchCon until after it already started.
7656553	7660635	And so I think that kind of, you know, they needed folks that were going to be available.
7660695	7663736	So Bobby will be here on the network, though, that night.
7663816	7666377	So for those of you that need something to listen to in a couple weeks, Bobby will be here.
7666657	7667418	So there is that.
7668318	7672102	Um, but otherwise, yeah, I'm hoping I get back to some personal streaming this week.
7672182	7682633	It's been a minute, but, um, with all the other bullshit going on, uh, hopefully if I have like the hardest part of this Convid stuff, you know, Paxilvid's been keeping most of the symptoms at bay.
7682753	7686958	It's the fucking fatigue today has been really bad, but actually like,
7688291	7688912	I'll see you next time.
