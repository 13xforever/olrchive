1
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

2
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:47,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:58,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 1018 of our program after a week off last week.

4
00:00:59,133 --> 00:00:59,634
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

5
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I am fighting Guinness right now.

6
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:19,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is this about the world record acknowledgement thing?

7
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the application that I submitted is like gone.

8
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:34,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my copy of the book though, which is... Yeah, so I found one though that's like longest running weekly podcast with the same host.

9
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

10
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:40,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like all in all podcasts, like ever.

11
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:41,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not just gaming, but all?

12
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:42,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:43,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

14
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:46,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still that other one though.

15
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:47,846
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're fully weekly.

16
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:53,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, I, yeah, it would either be the, well, I guess it would either count the other one if it was gaming.

17
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:55,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that, you know, two weeks ago.

18
00:01:55,254 --> 00:02:00,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I want to say some, I want to say the comic podcast, are Donna Drew still around?

19
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, like there's some old comedy podcasts.

20
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:06,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to need to find out what happened to that application.

21
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:06,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

22
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:06,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Find it.

23
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:07,806
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it in the bin.

24
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:08,627
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

25
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:10,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You better not have.

26
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

27
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Loki.

28
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,609
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this game playing behind you tonight?

29
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:26,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

30
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, having a live chat room here on Twitch, we can get corrected live.

31
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:32,963
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says that Don and Drew faded a while back.

32
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:40,010
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be a couple tech shows and things that are not necessarily gaming related that are still kicking all these years later, I'm sure.

33
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that stuff.

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,551
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Loki, what is this game playing behind you?

35
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that owl in the background looked like the Tootsie Roll owl.

36
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:49,434
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Plucky Squire.

37
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:50,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Plucky Squire.

38
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is like on my list of games I want to get around to playing because the art style in this looked really cool.

39
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had a chance to play this yet?

40
00:02:57,797 --> 00:02:58,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.

41
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:58,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bummer.

42
00:02:59,018 --> 00:02:59,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to check this out.

43
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:00,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really cool.

44
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,013
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Seattle.

46
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:26,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get cheap plane tickets.

47
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:29,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go play Ingress and I'll see some of my friends up here.

48
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:30,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did all of that.

49
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:33,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really fun, but it doesn't really relate to the gaming industry.

50
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:35,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my weekend.

51
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:42,429
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to talk a little more to DarkSakura and Loki because you both were at TwitchCon in San Diego.

52
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And how was it?

53
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It was painful.

54
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:52,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, I had some very wicked shoes.

55
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:54,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.

56
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:54,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

57
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:57,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was really fun.

58
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,819
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, this has got to be at least your what?

59
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like your fourth TwitchCon?

60
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,760
[SPEAKER_02]: My third.

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Your third.

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,421
[SPEAKER_02]: How did this year compare to the other two?

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:24,419
[SPEAKER_01]: um it was about the same I mean it was much better than Las Vegas I'll put it that way but I didn't do as much of the like hardcore networking that I do before and just was I wanted to have a good time this time and check out like news and I didn't really get to go to any of the panels I wanted to but um uh

64
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:34,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the meetup brunch that our big Dead by Daylight and whatnot group does.

65
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:45,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny enough, I was sitting there and I was chatting with Bourbon, who is our friend, DBD, and a variety streamer.

66
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:47,463
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy.

67
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:48,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I lurk in his channel.

68
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:50,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he knows who I am, but I lurk in his channel.

69
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:50,485
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good guy.

70
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:50,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

71
00:04:51,670 --> 00:05:04,299
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had this whole like set up to like do a green screen and take a picture and make it an avatar and blah blah blah and I don't know how it came up I was like yeah I should just have like a sign that says we'll squeak for boops because I was cosplaying pig

72
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,798
[SPEAKER_01]: and like, well, here's some paper and some Crayola markers.

73
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:09,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Have at it.

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:18,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made the sign and I was walking around with Will Boop for Squeaks and had a pig face with a little finger pointing at the nose.

75
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got many boops and oddly enough, like a bunch of photo ops that way.

76
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, for a Dead by Daylight crowd, that's a really clever idea, actually.

77
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:45,940
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a DBD meetup as well yeah because that's a that's a big meme in the game if you know if you've ever watched Dead by Daylight streamers booping a pig which is doing that because there's literally every character for some reason has an emo it's like pointing it's pointing but if you do it really close to pig it looks like you're booping your snoot and everybody loves if you're if you're both kneeling yeah yeah

78
00:05:46,721 --> 00:06:10,269
[SPEAKER_01]: and we even did like some kneeling poses so uh i got my my lunge exercises in for the day um and uh i uh i had to like shed costume to play para para paradise because yes there was a para para and i played the same three songs over and over that i still remember okay um there were a couple other people there the second day that knew the dances so that was fun that's cool

79
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to do Anniversary for you and then I forgot it.

80
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:15,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

81
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:17,986
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one I could maybe do Boom Boom Fire.

82
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:19,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom Boom Fire, Boom Boom Fire.

83
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I did Deluxe.

84
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of remember it.

85
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I did Deluxe and Night of Fire and Eurobeat.

86
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:49,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Eurobeat's an easy one you could just like watch it and pick it pick that one back up but I'm sorry Night of Fire is like the most fun one to do just because it's very active and posey at the same time well it's it's funny that there were people there the second day that knew the dances because I don't know if you know even though this show and I'm sure most people know at this point but if you didn't

87
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:50,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Launch Radio.

88
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:56,466
[SPEAKER_02]: We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and Konami's Bomani series and all that back in the day at the arcades.

89
00:06:56,846 --> 00:07:07,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we used to talk pretty much exclusively about that until that era when Konami really kind of let that go for a long time and then Guitar Hero ended up being on the scene and we ended up kind of expanding to all types of games.

90
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:25,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But I bring that up because now there's all these, I don't know if you know, but there's like new shows and new podcasts and Twitch personalities that are all about Bomani games and all of this because of the renaissance that round one has sort of lended itself to with, you know, Konami series and Konami is kind of investing in this arcades again.

91
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:34,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wouldn't surprise me, Jamie, if these people that came up that knew the dances were like part of this like new crowd and not realizing that you are their Aunt Jamie.

92
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:43,220
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there were like a couple of younger people, but mostly, I mean, I think that they were playing Parapara back in the day, too.

93
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Petition to change DarkSakura to AntSakura.

94
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:51,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I am the drunk auntie of Twitch, so whatever.

95
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:52,086
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love that.

96
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

97
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, this was your very first TwitchCon.

98
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: How were you overwhelmed, or how was it for you?

99
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:07,656
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wasn't necessarily overwhelmed because there wasn't a whole lot that I had scheduled.

100
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:13,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I did have a pretty packed schedule, but it was all kind of front-loaded within the first couple days.

101
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:19,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And then beyond that, it was just kind of like, I don't know, I'll go to some panels if I feel like it.

102
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:24,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up not really going to a lot of panels outside of the Minecraft stuff.

103
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:30,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I had kind of marked off some things that I was going to go check out, but I just didn't end up doing it.

104
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,994
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was packed.

105
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:44,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I peaked your Twitter because, and you know that's a compliment because I don't like to go on that site, but I was curious, like, did Loki post some pictures on TwitchCon?

106
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:45,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you got... I did not.

107
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:50,611
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but you had like a lot of selfies or like meet and greet type photos.

108
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:51,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

109
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:51,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

110
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:57,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, so I'll try to quickly go across what I did at TwitchCon, you know, the days.

111
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So, started the day before TwitchCon.

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:10,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So, essentially, everybody that was going to TwitchCon in, like, the MCC Rising stuff, Avondale, who actually runs...

113
00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:29,874
[SPEAKER_06]: MCC Rising and he does a bunch of other stuff for Nox Crew had asked like they did in Rotterdam if you want premium seating fill out this form and we'll get you on a list and stuff like that for the event so I filled that out but then one of the questions was

114
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you available from noon to six on Thursday?

115
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:35,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't say what it was.

116
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:38,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It just said, are you available from noon to six on Thursday?

117
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:43,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, between noon and six or for, you know, for six hours on Thursday.

118
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just wouldn't say what it was.

119
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was curious.

120
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ended up moving my flight.

121
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,522
[SPEAKER_06]: to make that time.

122
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:55,383
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got there like at 10 in the morning.

123
00:09:56,123 --> 00:10:02,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the day before, they let us know that we were playtesting MCC Twitch Rivals.

124
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:06,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, we got there at noon.

125
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:15,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Then everything kind of got delayed a couple hours because there was a Sanjay slam or whatever that was before it.

126
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:30,485
[SPEAKER_06]: um they were doing testing the producing entertainment always runs behind a couple hours yeah the the street fighter tournament thing they were running behind their testing stuff so we got postponed by two and a half hours this is why you needed six hours reserved

127
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:50,924
[SPEAKER_06]: right pretty much yeah yeah so so we went there and um yeah so we got the full experience of being a being like a contestant in twitch rivals we played on the it's not really a stage i guess it's like sort of a stage in on the actual pcs and everything that the contestants are going to be playing on so you

128
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Survivor Dream Team Survivor Dream Team

129
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:13,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

130
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so there's some stuff that they had to work out.

131
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:29,003
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was also, since it is the full experience, and they are practicing the production part of that as well, there's cameramen up in your face with production studio cameras and everything, and like the boom camera and all that stuff.

132
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:30,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really weird experience.

133
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:35,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have to make sure you pluck those gray eyebrows that I was complaining before the show, everybody.

134
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:40,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a gray eye, one singular gray little hair that was driving me bonkers.

135
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I plucked it in the two minutes before the show tonight.

136
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we got to do all that.

137
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:51,538
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a team with some of the other rising folks, and this guy, WoogieX, who was a friend of a rising person, who ended up playing on our team.

138
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Our team ended up winning, which is awesome.

139
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:57,301
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to win an MCC that doesn't really count, and nobody really can know about it.

140
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:03,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really supposed to share this on social media, but who watches this show after 20 years?

141
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, so we did all that.

142
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Print that in your book of world records.

143
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, world record, yeah.

144
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway,

145
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:12,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did all that.

146
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:13,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It was extremely exciting.

147
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:14,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a really good time.

148
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:23,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we had waited so long, Avondale had given us one of the MCC coins as well that you could purchase for Season 3.

149
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got one of those.

150
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:32,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next day, first day of TwitchCon, we had meet and greets with Hermitcraft folks.

151
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:37,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, I think at first it was the storytelling in Minecraft.

152
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did all that.

153
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

154
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:41,418
[SPEAKER_06]: That was R.A.

155
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really know the people that were doing that, but meet and greets with the Hermitcraft folks.

156
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:54,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was able to meet, I met Cubfan135, who is our coach in MCC, and he was really awesome.

157
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:57,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I've been kind of chatting back and forth with him, and

158
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been just very thankful.

159
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:05,336
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been really good at promoting our SMP and just so inviting.

160
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:09,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I got up to him, I'm like, oh, he's like, oh, who are you?

161
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm Loki.

162
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,761
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, oh, Loki, Loki, oh, come in here.

163
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:14,722
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me a hug and stuff like that.

164
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:15,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a super cool guy.

165
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:24,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I finally got to meet the hermit that I played with in my first SMP, TangoTex.

166
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:27,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to meet him in person and thank him for all the

167
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:55,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Inspiration that he's provided and everything I didn't get to meet a lot of people because at that point it started getting a little chaotic and the line wasn't moving as fast as they wanted it to so they were kind of rushing people through so I only got to see him for like a second and I didn't get to really meet anybody else but then later that night was a thing that I got invited to as part of the MCC stuff as well so it was the MCC Lunar Client Party so it was a private party

168
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Jimmy Buffett's Dollar Tree

169
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:35,359
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah uh anyways whatever it doesn't matter the location they had uh you know they catered uh was it uh pasta and tacos and other stuff there's a reason why Denny's at two in the morning was still fun back in the day even though it was Denny's

170
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:49,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then, so, I didn't really know a lot of people, obviously, at the MCC event, or the party, because there's a lot of people that do play MCC that are, like, really kind of the event hogs.

171
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:53,940
[SPEAKER_06]: They know, like, all the people that play, so they were a lot more familiar with everybody.

172
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't.

173
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki, for next year, Jamie's got the right idea.

174
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear a costume that everybody's going to want to take a picture with, and now you're meeting everybody.

175
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:01,973
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

176
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

177
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:05,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did end up hanging out with Cubfan.

178
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:13,281
[SPEAKER_06]: He was one of the two hermits that showed up because I guess the hermits are really tired, which I can imagine after meeting fans for two hours and 45 minutes.

179
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:19,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I got to hang out with him for like two hours and actually just like talk with him the entire time.

180
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was great.

181
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also...

182
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, can I tangent for a minute?

183
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:30,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Because 5th Dream in chat said, the goth hangout.

184
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:39,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously 5th Dream is talking about the Denny's at 2am reference, but for some reason when my brain first read that, I was like, is he talking about Margaritaville?

185
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Being like, the goth hangout?

186
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Jimmy Buffett secretly a backup singer for The Cure?

187
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what?

188
00:15:51,405 --> 00:16:20,761
[SPEAKER_06]: anyway, please excuse me I got to talk to him and met like Scott Smager who also runs MCC, met Noxite who is co-owner of or I think he is the owner of the Nox crew and just some other people as well another celebrity guy in the space TommyInIt and SmallishBeans who is Joel who is on the Hermitcraft he's one of the new Hermits this year

189
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:30,204
[SPEAKER_06]: and so yeah it was really cool to get to meet all them and just talk to Cub for like a while and he was just very inviting just made sure I was like comfortable in the whole event and everything.

190
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like the Minecraft community really turned out for this.

191
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:34,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.

193
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Saturday was the day of the event.

194
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got our premium seating, which is like front row.

195
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:50,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in like if you watch the the VODs of the event from TwitchCon, you can see me just constantly.

196
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:51,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just in the front row.

197
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's very obvious I'm wearing my jersey.

198
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,179
[SPEAKER_06]: for the Orange Ocelots.

199
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it was like an incredible time.

200
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:01,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I got swag from that.

201
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:04,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I got so they announced a card game that they're going to be doing, a collectible card game.

202
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:07,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an exclusive card, actually two of the exclusive cards.

203
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't have worn a VOG Network shirt that day, huh?

204
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

205
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:15,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I know MCC, you know, brings you a lot of pride.

206
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:15,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

207
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:16,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

208
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:21,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And then right after that, they had the Hermitcraft panel.

209
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:30,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were talking about 10 years of, you know, making content on Hermitcraft and all that stuff and kind of just going through all that.

210
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:36,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And then afterwards, they decided that they were going to do an impromptu meet and greet for everybody that showed up.

211
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So I finally got to meet a few other creators.

212
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I met Impulse, who does a podcast as well.

213
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:48,633
[SPEAKER_06]: They do the Imp and Skizz podcast, which is kind of with the Hermitcraft folks and Good Times at Scar.

214
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:59,693
[SPEAKER_06]: who is a really incredible builder so I got to meet him and I was able to say bye to Tango and Cub as well and just thank them for everything those guys should be waiting to meet you

215
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:07,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the secret to going viral on YouTube is because I think we all would have done it a long time ago, but you deserve it.

216
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,027
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these days, they're going to all be there to meet you.

217
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:52,129
[SPEAKER_06]: well they said you know they're like yeah we'll come back again and do this again in 10 years and I'm like I'm like well I'm gonna be on stage with you in 10 years so we'll see um and then uh was it uh so Saturday uh finally at that point I have not run into Jamie yet so I finally made up with Jamie and we we hung out pretty much the rest of uh TwitchCon to be fair that happens when Jamie and I both go to TwitchCon too I think one year we didn't see each other till the second day so

218
00:18:55,751 --> 00:19:10,000
[SPEAKER_06]: we met up to go to the Twitch block party but we got stopped by the hype train so I had to wait like 30 minutes for that thing to pull out and then, yeah, the block party was alright

219
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:24,075
[SPEAKER_06]: they had some good food and stuff but it was alright it was kind of weird though because they had a couple stages so there was like the techno electronica stage and then bad karaoke that were just like combining with each other really bad

220
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:48,896
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah it is it was not great uh so we kind of cut that short a bit and then was it Sunday I had a meet and greet with Smajor because he was kind of out of it uh the party that so I didn't really get to talk to him I think that a lot of the UK folks that were flying in were just really jet lagged so um I met him and thanked him for everything that he's done for like MCC and just in

221
00:19:49,296 --> 00:20:13,918
[SPEAKER_06]: keep including us and all that and uh so that's fun and then yeah we played uh music games and stuff got to play Dance Rush and stuff like that wow it sounds like they had quite a little music arcade they had quite the arcade yeah yeah Dance Rush uh they had a DDR machine that had uh it was a multi-loader in it because uh one day I saw it had Extreme we played it when it had Disney's Rave um

222
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,316
[SPEAKER_06]: There was, yeah, all sorts of Bomani games there.

223
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:22,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, like, everything from 2DX, DDR, In the Groove, Pump It Up.

224
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, like, so many music games.

225
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:26,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

226
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, what do you think?

227
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,930
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids are only going to get older and more independent.

228
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you might make it back next year?

229
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:33,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

230
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I...

231
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:39,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was very tired after all of that.

232
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I unfortunately came down with norovirus on the flight or the day home.

233
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:45,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something like that.

234
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,456
[SPEAKER_02]: You really were on Margaritaville.

235
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:53,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, so I was very sick to my stomach and just all of that, you know, trying to fly back.

236
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:59,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it took, I just now been able to eat regular food today.

237
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's taken a while to get past all that.

238
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,522
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're skinny.

239
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:08,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, but it was worth it.

240
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

241
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get some other people to go as well.

242
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:20,525
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our members of the Channel 64 SMP, people are thinking about going next year.

243
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:24,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be cool to have someone else to hang out with as well.

244
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:25,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

245
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:26,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

246
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:26,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.

247
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:27,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go back next year.

248
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:29,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll see.

249
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,711
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already said it's still in San Diego, and I'm like, great.

250
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:55,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not probably go to the hotel I was at, that hotel made no sense and it's still pretty far away I would want to see if I could get something a little bit less expensive and maybe closer to the convention because it was still quite a ways, even though it was just within walking distance it was just 8 blocks back and forth, so I don't know

251
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into headlines tonight, I actually want to go back to Jamie talking about TwitchCon a little bit.

252
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you what your damage was in the art dealer hall this year.

253
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:10,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it out pretty decently, I will be honest.

254
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,940
[SPEAKER_01]: This application is so stupid.

255
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

256
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:29,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, let me ask you about, because we didn't talk about, Loki didn't really talk about the vendors in the main hall, and there's always the exhibits in the main hall, and DarkSakura, I know you're pretty good about, you'll just walk up and chat to people that are running booths and stuff.

257
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:33,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious if you saw anything that kind of caught your eye in the main exhibit hall.

258
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,267
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some really good artists.

259
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

260
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:46,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a very... Why can't I think of his name?

261
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:47,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Like...

262
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:52,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Mooka, Alphonse Mooka inspired Garrus print.

263
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a pretty hot kind of bloody Astarion.

264
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Bought dice, mystery dice.

265
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And down, well, there was also vendors downstairs.

266
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:09,203
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, I rolled, in fact, I've got the candle in front of me.

267
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:15,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a candle called A Dicey Surprise by Sweet As Scents Candle Company.

268
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:21,906
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is a lemon, like a lemony candle.

269
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:22,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells really good.

270
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:26,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I rolled a D20 and rolled a 20.

271
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:29,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a 20% off discount.

272
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fun.

273
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:37,285
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people doing, you know, like clothes, nerdy clothes.

274
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:42,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got my Eat Cheese and Sin sticker, which made me very happy.

275
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:44,928
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just a couple of things all around.

276
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:51,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were also, there was one called, oh gosh, was it Melanin Minerals?

277
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:55,112
[SPEAKER_01]: That I picked up a couple of bath bombs the last day.

278
00:23:55,852 --> 00:24:01,755
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD infused bath bombs that honestly, when mixed with my Epsom salts, made for a very nice bath.

279
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:28,343
[SPEAKER_01]: and I needed it because I did Disneyland after the con oh my god I can't imagine I'm stubborn anyway and the block party you should have seen my shoes although last year we did Disneyland first and then TwitchCon and it was pretty rough that's probably why I didn't go back this year to be honest you should have seen my shoes Rob for the party I had regrets I should have worn my toe pads for ballet

280
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:35,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have loved to do karaoke on the big stage though.

281
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the perfect song.

282
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:37,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so good.

283
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:43,653
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people that I really wish would have learned how to pick a key.

284
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting in all this information it wants to erase.

285
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:49,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so stupid.

286
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:49,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

287
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:54,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The song I would do, to be clear, is I'm the Scatman by Scatman John.

288
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:56,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Would absolutely have to be the song you need to do.

289
00:24:56,622 --> 00:25:05,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I forgot to mention, we hung out a little bit with GDQX as well, so that was kind of fun.

290
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:06,349
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

291
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:07,930
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, we got my shirt.

292
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I got mine too.

293
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:10,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how about that?

294
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:16,880
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the limited edition Peloton-sponsored shirts.

295
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

296
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw something of a Peloton-sponsoring GDQX.

297
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:23,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, I was out of town the whole weekend, so I didn't get to see any of it, but interesting.

298
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:24,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

299
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:26,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.

300
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

301
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,704
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was, I mean...

302
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,462
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some interesting costumes as well.

303
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:43,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I said, there was a DBD meet and there was a Jake I met.

304
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Jake cosplay is pretty easy.

305
00:25:46,501 --> 00:26:03,989
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and then um it was you know but he looks the part he really looks he really looks the part and then there was a sort of a Huntress it was really uh kind of I guess Huntress themed and people kept giving me bracelets and stickers I now have a pixel pig sticker I love it

306
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:09,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go look through all of this to find who these artists were, but they were all amazing.

307
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:15,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had a really, really good time, and then on Sunday I was like, no cosplay!

308
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:19,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Loki if he's going back next year.

309
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:20,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to go back next year?

310
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:21,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

311
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:25,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured you were probably already sold on it, but I had to ask.

312
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:27,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm definitely going.

313
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:33,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to probably buy better insoles for those boots, because you know I got a

314
00:26:34,560 --> 00:27:01,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta bring a pig and I got to I'm actually thinking of doing Chibi Huntress or revamping my Julie cosplay well you got a year to figure it out time starts now yes I'm doing all Dead by Daylight cosplay we'll see what happens oh and one thing because I'm allergic to latex so I couldn't wear a big pig mask so I brought my little pig mask and people liked it I guess

315
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,100
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

316
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we will, I'm sure, talk more about TwitchCon as things remind us of that throughout the night.

317
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:17,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to move on with the stories because actually, unlike a lot of weeks here recently on the show where it's kind of like, oh, there's not a lot going on this week.

318
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a lot happened this week, and it's probably thanks to Tokyo Game Show.

319
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:27,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been a lot of stuff kind of happening about the industry and not directly in the industry either.

320
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:32,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you want to tell us about this new law that could change some things in the gaming industry?

321
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:47,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law, AB 2426, to combat disappearing purchases of digital games, movies, and music and e-books.

322
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:57,316
[SPEAKER_06]: They say it'll force digital storefronts to tell customers that they're just getting a license to use the digital media rather than suggesting that you own it.

323
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:11,452
[SPEAKER_06]: and it will ban storefronts from using the terms buy or purchase unless they inform consumers that they're not getting unrestricted access

324
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,063
[SPEAKER_06]: to whatever they're buying.

325
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:18,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this necessarily is going to make much of a difference.

326
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:29,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a pretty good comparison to essentially like those warning labels that you see on a lot of products where it contains lead or something like that.

327
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:35,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just they're going to have that label up there, but at the end of the day, is anyone really going to pay attention to it?

328
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I highly doubt this changes anything at the end of the day.

329
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:47,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more curious about what wordsmithing the lawyers are going to come up with to get around this, basically.

330
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's the fuzzy language you're going to see on PlayStation Store now?

331
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:53,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this isn't just going to affect California.

332
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: California may have passed the law, but let's be real.

333
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,781
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation is going to have to make the change.

334
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:03,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we say that, Nintendo, everybody else is going to have to make the change on their storefronts, and it's going to impact everybody.

335
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:06,986
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm kind of curious how they're going to get around the word buy.

336
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:09,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're going to do something like play now.

337
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Access now.

338
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Add to library.

339
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump in and play.

340
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:16,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Add to library.

341
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:18,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be a huge one.

342
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Add to gaming library now.

343
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:32,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the lawyers will dig into exactly what they can and can't say but I think they're just going to dance around it in the wording front and not a lot is really going to change.

344
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I...

345
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is a good thing to kind of put that front of mind and it also feels a little bit like a Hail Mary for the physical industry too because it kind of

346
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:47,733
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:31,098
[SPEAKER_02]: where that's not possible I'm very curious what happens on that front but you know we'll see what the legal departments come up with yeah Bobby clarifies to be fair they can still say buyer purchase as long as it includes the license verbiage doesn't it have to be the same size as the buy like the license verbiage has to be the same size as buy because if that's the case they're not going to do it it's too that's too much too much wordy on the screen you know what I mean

348
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:35,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like they're going to bury it somewhere.

349
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it count if they mention it in the EULA?

350
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it will be buried and it's going to say add to library now or play now for the will be the button.

351
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:50,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get around it because that's what happens all the time with these types of laws.

352
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:50,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like

353
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:54,176
[SPEAKER_02]: How far down this rabbit hole do I want to go?

354
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:57,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the plastic bag ban here in California.

355
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what happened when they did the plastic bag ban?

356
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Stores started selling a different kind of plastic bag.

357
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:04,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what's happening?

358
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,887
[SPEAKER_02]: All those plastic bags are ending up in the trash.

359
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:13,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're having to do another bill to basically say you can't sell that plastic bag either.

360
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:13,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

361
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:19,224
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's just, you know, they're gonna- Yeah, but the paper bags suck and I like the new plastic bags.

362
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,506
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a lot thicker and so they don't, like, just fall apart like the old plastic bags.

363
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:25,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I the only one that likes a paper bag?

364
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:37,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't- I find that the paper bag, if it wasn't gonna break, the problem is they put a paper bag, you have a paper bag, and then they put, like, the teensiest- they attach it to a handle that is, like,

365
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Like scotch taped to the bag, practically.

366
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:43,424
[SPEAKER_06]: It is just like the weakest garbage ever.

367
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:47,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Trader Joe's, for example, offers those paper bags.

368
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And more times than not, those handles rip right off.

369
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:57,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... I mean, to be fair, you are supposed to use a recyclable bag, I should say.

370
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like, sometimes...

371
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's just not in the plan.

372
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to something last minute and it's just not in the plan.

373
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:08,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they just do it the way they used to.

374
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:14,704
[SPEAKER_06]: They still charge you for a bag now but you could bring your own bags and then they just use those.

375
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:17,765
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it used to be.

376
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:18,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we used to do it.

377
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

378
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:28,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I find it so funny that when I go to a store and purchase something

379
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,920
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

380
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:22,283
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Target for a while while they had those bags banned were giving out like for 10 cents you would get one of those like canvas bags and it would just be that was just the standard that they would hand out with it those were cool I'm like totally fine with those if that's what they want to move to because those hold up just fine and it's not plastic but I don't know it it

381
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:27,512
[SPEAKER_06]: People need to carry stuff home, and they're just, they're not going to use recycled little bags.

382
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's just not going to happen, so.

383
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:37,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Audience chat says, every time I travel to, say, a GDQ and hit up a Target, the fact I have to pay for a bag is so weird.

384
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, consider the reverse.

385
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:42,736
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to CVS at DragonCon, and then I'm like, wait, wait, wait, I get plastic bags?

386
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:46,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I should, like, smuggle these home in my suitcase so I have something to put the cat litter in when I get home.

387
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:50,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring my own bags usually when I shop.

388
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:59,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, and a lot of people do, but sometimes like, you know, just realistically, I could have the bags in the back of the car and it still would make its way into the store.

389
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:00,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't explain it.

390
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a thing.

391
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:02,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

392
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,186
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

393
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it involved bringing it home in a plastic bag or not.

394
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:15,753
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

395
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Busy.

396
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:25,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a bunch of the stupid State Farm games and one of them made me play NBA 2K whatever and I hated it.

397
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:27,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

398
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't like sports ball games.

399
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a booth at Twitch or something?

400
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:33,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Jake was there.

401
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a Jake from State Farm plushie.

402
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:37,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Or pop figure, sorry.

403
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:43,685
[SPEAKER_06]: He was part of the Twitch Rivals thing for some reason.

404
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:43,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that

405
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:49,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like, at the Chevron booth I had to play... It wasn't... Was it Forza?

406
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:55,937
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of those racing games, and I'm used to playing with, like, an actual good wheel and a rig.

407
00:34:56,737 --> 00:35:00,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the last time, literally, I've played, like, a racing game that wasn't R4.

408
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Chevron not, like, a Jake?

409
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:04,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, George the Gas?

410
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:04,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

411
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:06,447
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, though, like...

412
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:16,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it was the last day, just for signing up for their little app, you get a $25 gift card, like a gas card, and then they gave me one just for trying the game.

413
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:25,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this wonderful guy named Luke visiting from Scotland gave me two cards, so I have $100 in Chevron gas.

414
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:30,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That bought you the gas to drive down there and back, to be honest.

415
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:31,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And I drive a Fiat.

416
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:57,249
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that's a few tanks yeah that's nice just saying um but at any rate um i also can't find where i put them they're somewhere in my luggage um at any rate um i also uh like i said played para para um what was that what's that other not ddr game dance rush stardom yeah i played that that was pretty fun um and we also played uh disney's rave

417
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,935
[SPEAKER_01]: That was... I'd forgotten how much fun that game was.

418
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:11,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've played... I haven't played any Dead by Daylight this week, honestly, enough.

419
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:12,085
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did play Polya.

420
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:17,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Suika game, the stupid watermelon game.

421
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:19,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

422
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:26,656
[SPEAKER_01]: and I ran around being absolutely in pain the entire time.

423
00:36:27,116 --> 00:36:31,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wonder if Smuggler's Run counts as a game because I had to push a button a few times and I got a score.

424
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:35,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, was there like a particular Disneyland ride you enjoyed?

425
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're all good, but...

426
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:40,188
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I love Rise of the Resistance and I did that shit twice.

427
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got flirted with by Kylo Ren.

428
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fun.

429
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you by yourself or were you hanging with other DVD people?

430
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: By myself, of course.

431
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:49,773
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way.

432
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:51,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because single writer lines.

433
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, not everything has single writer anymore.

434
00:36:54,831 --> 00:37:03,256
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had this goal that I was going to find a Kylo Ren and defect, just to be silly.

435
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:04,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found one.

436
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:07,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, my lord, I defect to the First Order.

437
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:12,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gets all up in my face and is like, remember this feeling.

438
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:16,706
[SPEAKER_01]: You will remember it every day, the feeling of serving beneath me.

439
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:17,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, you flirting, dude.

440
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:18,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

441
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:19,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

442
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:21,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Kylo Ren!

443
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that was great.

444
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:25,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It would only be good if your voice changed just like that.

445
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Kylo Ren, uwu.

446
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,500
Thank you, daddy, uwu.

447
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,464
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had such a fun time.

448
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:36,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It was...

449
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:41,790
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and like, I actually went, they sell Disney themed Crocs.

450
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that the problem was that my normal ones that I wear every day are like a size too big.

451
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:50,757
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went and got like sandals.

452
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:53,359
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like Minnie Mouse sandals, but they're actually kind of cute.

453
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wore those.

454
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,922
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about the same price as like Crocs sandals would be outside the park.

455
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't mad about it.

456
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:05,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took out like these like compression bands that I use for art support and ballet class.

457
00:38:06,749 --> 00:38:31,238
[SPEAKER_01]: and I felt pretty okay the rest of the time you know until I got back and my feet were swollen um but I mean overall it was you know I'd say that a lot of it was more like there was gaming and then there was more gaming adjacent things but I also have to right now go on the record saying that I think if not for ballet I wouldn't have been able to play all those dancing games

458
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:34,815
[SPEAKER_01]: and have stamina to do it.

459
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:37,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really have stamina for those dancing games.

460
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:52,818
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I played Dance Rush I had to go back to my hotel with the light down because I was so exhausted and felt sick to my stomach from just over-exerting myself because I had been walking so much already.

461
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, why did I do that?

462
00:38:55,439 --> 00:39:01,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that last day we played three games of that each and then I did five games of Parapara and then we did DDR.

463
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:22,343
[SPEAKER_06]: is because I went because I hadn't played the game before and so I went from like you know I was like oh three stars that's nothing I'll play this seven star one it'll be fine you know and it's like yeah no that's way harder uh that is a lot harder uh it's really fun I just was disappointed that um

464
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:38,947
[SPEAKER_06]: some of those songs were locked but I had my EMU's card I should have just scanned it and done that I really wanted to play Gimme a Big Beat because I love that song but I got to watch someone play it and that was just as fun

465
00:39:40,472 --> 00:40:04,217
[SPEAKER_01]: well I you know what it was I noticed myself doing like um every time it would say down you know when you're supposed to crouch or whatever I would do a plie and I was like man I thought you know my ballet class would be kind of proud of me because like now I just can't help it like if I jump it's like you know my feet go into the little arch and then fall back down and it's like

466
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:31,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Ballet has ruined me for doing anything in this game but at least I'm like jumping and crouching properly and my back didn't really hurt so much so it was fun though I had I had a really I want to bring back the Bimani Knights I really do it was so much fun and it was fun because like and Loki I don't know if you got this feeling but it kind of felt like the old days didn't it a little bit yeah

467
00:40:32,031 --> 00:41:01,823
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it really did and I was I'd be down for a trip for round one on a weeknight when it's not gonna be super crowded it it honestly was like one of the happiest feelings I think I've had in a long time just it was nostalgia and and just joy it was really a fun time this is actually really funny that you went down a Bimani nostalgia rabbit hole this week hold that thought so anyway if you're all done with your gaming week I'm gonna go to Loki yeah

468
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:05,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

469
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically the stuff I mentioned before.

470
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dance Rush Stardom, played a couple games of that.

471
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney's Rave played a game of that.

472
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:25,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And Minecraft this week, I've been just playing some stuff, just trying to work on the big build for this season.

473
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:33,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Still stressing out about it because it's massive and I just need to get past it so that I can

474
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:35,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Not stress out about it anymore.

475
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:38,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's coming along.

476
00:41:38,912 --> 00:41:39,853
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks really cool.

477
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so massive and there's so much to do.

478
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:44,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very overwhelming.

479
00:41:45,174 --> 00:41:51,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And then next season I'm going to do something equally overwhelming but a different type of overwhelming so that'll be kind of fun.

480
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:56,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have new people joining up next season as well so that'll be fun as well.

481
00:41:57,438 --> 00:41:57,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

482
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:58,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just looking forward to it.

483
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:03,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have like three months I have left to get this done and I feel

484
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,080
[SPEAKER_06]: The pressure.

485
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:09,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I know how much time this is going to take and I don't have the time.

486
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, I have to get the rest of the park done too.

487
00:42:11,384 --> 00:42:14,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, too much.

488
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,208
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do have folks willing to help.

489
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:23,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to be able to figure out where I can have them help and then they'll do it.

490
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:25,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just trying to figure all that out.

491
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:28,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's project managing, which is a whole other thing.

492
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:38,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just... The problem is I don't have... When I go into some of these projects, especially with a season, I have a vague idea of what I want to do, but I don't have it all planned out yet.

493
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's where the design process sometimes takes a long time because...

494
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:45,007
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

495
00:43:05,738 --> 00:43:10,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on the number of views that I get, no one's going to notice either way.

496
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,621
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because that'll be the one that goes viral.

497
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:14,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch, that'll be the one that Minecraft's going to retweet.

498
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:15,902
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not.

499
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:17,062
[SPEAKER_06]: We all do this.

500
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Jess on Channel 64 does the same thing.

501
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:28,987
[SPEAKER_06]: It does end up pushing our quality much higher than other people, but at what cost?

502
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It took them four months to get an episode out.

503
00:43:31,648 --> 00:43:32,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

504
00:43:33,307 --> 00:43:33,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

505
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:38,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a learning process still even three years into it.

506
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:41,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning the balance polished versus...

507
00:43:43,126 --> 00:44:03,463
[SPEAKER_06]: you know simplicity to get content out because not everything has to be overly complicated you don't have to have the whole project done for one episode I'm having trouble breaking that habit but next season I will have to because it is impossible to get this project done in one episode it would just be ridiculous so I will have to break that habit

508
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,260
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

509
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:27,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is I really want to stream.

510
00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:30,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to figure that out and figure out what do I want to get back into.

511
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:32,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of stewing on it.

512
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:41,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a fun project might be to try to take on old games and try to beat as many as I can on stream.

513
00:44:41,921 --> 00:44:45,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Nintendo doesn't really have an achievement system.

514
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that I'm a trophy whore.

515
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:49,423
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

516
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:20,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of looking at like, okay, well, I wonder if somebody has built some type of mechanism to track maybe like a virtual trophy shelf or something.

517
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:28,221
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, and of course, this thing has existed on the internet for over a decade, and I just recently found out about it.

518
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:32,922
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's this whole website, and it is emulators for better or for worse.

519
00:45:33,202 --> 00:45:33,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

520
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:35,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have their opinions on it.

521
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:40,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind emulators because quite frankly, they can upscale games and make them really fun and do things with them.

522
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:44,927
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's this whole thing called RetroAchievements.org.

523
00:45:45,388 --> 00:45:54,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it is a way to have an achievement system through retro games like emulating Nintendo, PlayStation, all of it.

524
00:45:54,412 --> 00:46:01,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much if RetroArch runs it, it's something that you can actually use emulators and have this achievement system in.

525
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fell down a rabbit hole hard because I was like, okay,

526
00:46:05,217 --> 00:46:34,095
[SPEAKER_02]: so now this can be like the tracking system to sort of track the different games that I beat and there's even like this you know literal literal virtual yeah Bobby's saying waiting for Rob to discover crowd control next I literally have no idea what that is I'm gonna have to google it but anyway um so I haven't touched emulators in a long time to be honest so I kind of fell down this rabbit hole hard because at first I was like all right well let me see how this whole achievement thing works let me play like a Nintendo NES game and

527
00:46:34,396 --> 00:46:35,879
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

528
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:51,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro Achievements actually sort of builds in a system to define what is the clear criteria for certain games.

529
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I sort of realized after that, I was like, oh, you know what?

530
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:58,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never really be able to stream old school DDR games.

531
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:03,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go, I just want to go back and play like some DDR third mix, DDR fifth mix.

532
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what I did.

533
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in and I started playing some DDR fifth mix.

534
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:13,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, yeah, there's just like a million achievements for these games because of course there's an achievement for like,

535
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:18,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You full comboed on Basic, you full comboed on Trick, you full comboed on Maniac, and all this stuff.

536
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And doubles, Loki, your favorite.

537
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:33,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, there's a million things to accomplish, but, like, I have quote-unquote beat DDR third mix at this point because I hit all the criteria, which was basically, I think it was, like, just clear every song.

538
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:41,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You click here on progression, and then it says, like, you just have to beat all of these songs, basically, and then it is considered you have beaten the game.

539
00:47:41,614 --> 00:47:43,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So, according to this website, I have beat...

540
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:49,419
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Third Mix, which is a game I wouldn't really be able to stream anyway because of all the licensed music in it.

541
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:54,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I only realized today, I was like, I guess I could stream Konomics.

542
00:47:55,022 --> 00:48:00,625
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one DDR that's completely safe would be DDR Konomics because that was all the Konami originals in the US.

543
00:48:00,665 --> 00:48:02,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll save that one for someday.

544
00:48:02,486 --> 00:48:04,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, everybody in chat is like,

545
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:05,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I love retro achievements.

546
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:06,949
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean you've never heard of it?

547
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Pixelpaka says, I love retro achievements.

548
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:12,275
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeRite says, retro achievements is great.

549
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't tried it yet, but watch people who use it.

550
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:21,504
[SPEAKER_02]: RecordWN in chat says, I played Super Mario 1 for an embarrassing amount of time last year with retro achievements.

551
00:48:21,824 --> 00:48:22,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So much fun.

552
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: S2-100 Matt has framed this perfectly in chat Rob found a shiny Yes

553
00:48:43,564 --> 00:49:08,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a shiny, exactly Bobby Blackwolf says crowd control hooks into games and lets Twitch chat influence your game to either help you or hinder you I've heard of that in like individual games I didn't know that so that's something you can even do in like retro games that's kind of cool, maybe I will look into that that might be kind of fun, who knows so anyway

554
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:36,087
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the rabbit hole I fell down this week but DarkSakura when you were talking about kind of rediscovering your love of DDR and Bomani games I feel like I hit that same thing a completely different way like there's the path through the forest that diverge and go two different ways but at the end of the day we got to the same place I think that's really funny I think you liked one of my posts on social media about it because I was playing

555
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard some of these songs in a long time.

556
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:45,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Erotic and Captain Jack, but I was playing that If You Can Say Goodbye by The Kate Project, which is one of my favorite songs in DDR3 mix.

557
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:47,493
[SPEAKER_01]: That song was stuck in my head all day, by the way.

558
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:50,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the last time I heard that song, right?

559
00:49:51,676 --> 00:49:54,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was playing that in the game, and I got a full combo and everything, and I was like...

560
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

561
00:49:56,498 --> 00:50:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this cheesy-ass Eurodance music really takes me back.

562
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:10,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I made a blue sky bleat that said something like, I will never apologize for loving cheesy Eurodance music.

563
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:10,961
[SPEAKER_02]: No takebacks.

564
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:11,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Doubling down.

565
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:13,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's true.

566
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:17,742
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about the cheesy songs that take me back to that place.

567
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:19,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's pretty amazing.

568
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:20,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

569
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:25,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, SS2100Matt says, gotta love a good Venn diagram, especially when it's Bomani related.

570
00:50:26,146 --> 00:50:26,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, certainly.

571
00:50:26,947 --> 00:50:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a rabbit hole.

572
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:35,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I will continue to find myself down off stream, but on stream, I will plan to take on some challenges next week.

573
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:46,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And I already know what I want the first game to be because I believe in my heart of hearts, every retro project should always start from here on out with this game.

574
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, I'm going to leave you with that teaser.

575
00:50:49,622 --> 00:50:50,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Tune in next week.

576
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:51,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what it was next week.

577
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:53,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

578
00:50:53,686 --> 00:50:57,050
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, we're going to get into some more gaming news.

579
00:50:57,951 --> 00:51:09,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to that, though, I did just want to mention real quick, as I am aware that there's a big hurricane that happened on the East Coast, Hurricane Helene.

580
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:10,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They shut down the Waffle House.

581
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and so you know shit got real if Waffle Houses were closing.

582
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:18,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a serious note, I know that people passed away because of this, which is really, really sad.

583
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:27,327
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know we may have some folks that live in western North Carolina or eastern Georgia that may have been impacted by this.

584
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:28,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby's in Atlanta.

585
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: He was fine.

586
00:51:29,228 --> 00:51:35,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the original path of the hurricane was supposed to go his way, but it kind of veered a little more towards North Carolina.

587
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:40,912
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless of where it went, I hope those of you that were impacted by that are A-OK.

588
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really sorry to hear about that.

589
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:52,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, and funny enough, I got a text during the show here at the beginning from one of my friends asking if I've heard from Extifer, because Extifer lives in North Carolina.

590
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Xfer made a post this morning.

591
00:51:55,083 --> 00:52:02,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Xfer also lives in the Raleigh-Carrie-Durham Triangle area and which was, I believe, got a lot of rain.

592
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:03,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of similar to Atlanta.

593
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:06,394
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of rain, but not the full force of the storm.

594
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:11,599
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, DJ Ranma S in chat says, one of my friends lost her trailer and everything.

595
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, that's really, really sad to hear.

596
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really sorry to hear that.

597
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:21,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, just anybody who may have been in the path of all that from Florida, because I know we have a lot of listeners in Florida.

598
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:26,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'm not sure I haven't checked in with last time I talked to X-Link.

599
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:27,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a very long time ago.

600
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:36,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he was in North Florida, so I don't know if he was impacted by any of that, but yeah, you know, I'm just, you know, I think about y'all that live in that part of the country often when these, uh, news happens.

601
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:38,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope you all are a okay.

602
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:39,621
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

603
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:42,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and get into some gaming news.

604
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, X-Link is in New York now.

605
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:49,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow missed the memo, but as far as this news is concerned, good.

606
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to hear it.

607
00:52:51,098 --> 00:52:51,358
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

608
00:52:52,138 --> 00:53:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some gaming news and headlines and talk about what is going on this week in gaming, including Loki, Tokyo Game Show, right?

609
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:02,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot out of that.

610
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:09,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was an Xbox event at Tokyo Game Show, which you're like, well, why?

611
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:09,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're going to...

612
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're still trying, so that's good.

613
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they finally making a ploy for Japan again?

614
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying, I guess.

615
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:24,733
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a bunch of trailers that they showed off, so starting off with a new trailer for Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake.

616
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,594
[SPEAKER_06]: However, though, there's still no release date for it.

617
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:37,517
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Overwatch 2 as getting a My Hero Academia mashup with new skins.

[SPEAKER_06]: We have Tanuki Pon Summer, which is a BMX-like sim.

620
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:19,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Tanuki riding a bike?

621
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:20,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that looks amazing.

622
00:54:21,816 --> 00:54:23,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from the makers of Curse of Golf.

623
00:54:23,658 --> 00:54:24,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's going to be cute then.

624
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:32,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cel-shaded game inspired by Japanese small towns, and it's a construction sim with BMX tricks.

[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is, but I'm buying it.

629
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:37,384
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cute.

630
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,073
[SPEAKER_06]: No release date for that, though.

631
00:54:41,093 --> 00:54:41,874

646
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:54,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

647
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fallout 76 is getting pets.

648
00:55:59,587 --> 00:56:00,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the dog.

649
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:07,411
[SPEAKER_06]: But in this case, you'll have dogs, cats, and other furry companions.

650
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,612
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have cats that can kill things like...

651
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,444
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your dog in Fallout 4?

652
00:56:15,725 --> 00:56:16,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog meat?

653
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:17,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to be cat meat?

654
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:24,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Suikoden Remaster is going to be Suikoden 1 and 2 Remasters.

655
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess those are coming to Xbox as well.

656
00:56:26,755 --> 00:56:28,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And they showed off some more stuff for that.

657
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,501
[SPEAKER_06]: All you need is help.

658
00:56:58,522 --> 00:57:01,383
[SPEAKER_06]: QGames, known for the PixelJunk franchise.

659
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:04,145
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a multiplayer party game called All You Need Is Help.

660
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:11,368
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of looks like that Yarn Yoshi game, but it's a 3D Tetris type game with kind of that Yarn aesthetic to it.

661
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming to Xbox Series X and S. PC and Game Pass.

662
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun fun.

663
00:57:18,631 --> 00:57:20,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, we've got...

664
00:57:21,598 --> 00:57:25,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Slitherhead, which was from the original director of Silent Hill.

665
00:57:26,419 --> 00:57:28,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So more shown on that.

666
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:28,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks creepy.

667
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out on November 8th.

668
00:57:32,101 --> 00:57:38,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Starbites Tales of the Desert is a new sci-fi RPG.

669
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:39,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting kind of like.

670
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:46,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Fancy Star Online vibes, I guess, sort of, but the game looks sort of like Mega Man Legends.

671
00:57:47,586 --> 00:57:48,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

672
00:57:49,622 --> 00:58:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D Remake is including a new class that's pretty cool and then oh yeah, Monster Wrangler is the new class that you'll get to be able to learn and use enemy abilities, that sounds like Final Fantasy 4 Final Fantasy 1 through 6 Pixel Remasters finally on Xbox X and S

673
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:41,166
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh yeah I think the only bummer is it kind of feels like too late you know like I feel like most people that one of those games already picked them up if not the original release on PC then picked them up on you know PlayStation or Switch like you know Xbox being last to the ball really only caters to those where Xbox is their primary gaming system of

674
00:58:41,206 --> 00:58:42,807
[SPEAKER_02]: of which I do know a few people.

675
00:58:42,827 --> 00:58:54,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a fair percentage of people that, you know, they don't have a high-end PC, and so yes, their Xbox, especially Series S, being the, you know, a little more budget-friendly option, is the primary gaming device.

676
00:58:54,373 --> 00:59:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am happy for those folks, but it just, in some ways, it feels like, talk about being late to the ball.

677
00:59:00,857 --> 00:59:02,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

678
00:59:02,177 --> 00:59:09,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Square Enix had a new trailer for the Mana port, so the Legend of Mana port,

679
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:11,479
[SPEAKER_06]: and was it Trials of Mana?

680
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:18,021
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also going to have a lot of that supported to Xbox PC and it's going to be on Game Pass as well.

681
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:20,322
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mana games on Game Pass are a pretty big deal.

682
00:59:21,063 --> 00:59:28,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Trials and not Vision, the newest one, Visions, isn't on Game Pass but Trials and Legend, the PS1 reimagining is there.

683
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:28,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

684
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:28,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

685
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:52,034
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's everything for the Tokyo Game Show Xbox showcase we also had on quickly before you go to the other what do you think of that like do you think they did enough like I think it's nice I mean it's one of those things you kind of go well at least they acknowledged Xbox acknowledged Japan you tried they certainly put some effort in I don't know we'll have to see what Japan thinks about it I mean true

686
00:59:53,432 --> 01:00:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, some of that stuff, like the Pixel Remasters doesn't really mean anything to me because it's like, I could play them on PC for a while now I agree with Mike Defko, Trials and Legends on Game Pass is great, I do agree like some of those Game Pass, and then We Heart Katamari also being on Game Pass great, especially when it feels like Game Pass has maybe been losing a little bit of value recently.

687
01:00:14,142 --> 01:00:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's been out forever though, I mean like I understand, like that's cool For people that didn't pick it up, and now Game Pass you know, it's included, it's

688
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:24,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Every game they put on Game Pass enhances the value a little bit, right?

689
01:00:24,508 --> 01:00:25,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It's needed.

690
01:00:25,128 --> 01:00:41,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more like, you know, rooted in Japanese development type of games they can get on there, I think is good, not just for the Japanese audience, but really there's a large audience here in the States that likes to play Japanese developed games, you know, sometimes exclusively so almost.

691
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:43,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think getting that type of stuff is huge.

692
01:00:43,484 --> 01:00:48,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be one of those playing that, you know, that game with the Tanuki and the BMX bike.

693
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:49,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean Minecraft?

694
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

695
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,992
[SPEAKER_06]: If only they had Tanooki and a BMX bike in Minecraft.

696
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:56,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, modded probably, but you know.

697
01:00:58,073 --> 01:01:00,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so not just Xbox, but...

698
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:18,489
[SPEAKER_06]: but PlayStation so we had a state of play they showed off quite a few things with that as well first thing we had was a brand new free expansion or update for Astro Bot which is going to add new character cameos including those from Helldivers and Stellar Blade that's coming in this fall and

699
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:39,611
[SPEAKER_06]: we had a trailer for something called Midnight Walk which is by the developers of Lost and Random it's a stop motion style horror game looks kind of creepy it's going to be out on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR 2 also a game called Hell Is Us

700
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:52,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a science fiction Souls-like game, which I thought almost was Death Stranding at first, because the style of the costumes and everything looks very Death Stranding-like, but it is not.

701
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:55,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's creepy looking.

702
01:01:57,074 --> 01:01:59,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we had Metro Awakening VR.

703
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:05,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a new game in the Metro series that is coming out on PlayStation VR 2 on November 7th.

704
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,400
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah, I like the Metro series.

705
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of cool.

706
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We had ArcheAge Chronicles.

707
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fantasy action game, which looks pretty cool.

708
01:02:18,923 --> 01:02:24,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to have some multiplayer as well coming out on PlayStation 5 in 2025.

709
01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:28,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Palworld announced for the PlayStation 5.

710
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:32,088
[SPEAKER_06]: That timing couldn't be any more awkward.

711
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:33,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold that thought.

712
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:35,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's coming.

713
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:37,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're going to talk about it next.

714
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,886

716
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of friends I have that said, that's all I needed.

717
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:54,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Pack it up.

732
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that you can store your random encounters and do them all at once.

733
01:04:53,632 --> 01:04:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

734
01:04:54,415 --> 01:04:54,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's funny.

735
01:04:56,863 --> 01:04:59,492
[SPEAKER_06]: BioWare showed off new footage for Dragon Age Veilguard.

736
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:04,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh fuck, that's coming too in October.

01:05:05,195 --> 01:05:05,895
[SPEAKER_01]: October 31st.

738
01:05:05,995 --> 01:05:08,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be broke.

739
01:05:08,957 --> 01:05:12,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even as into Dragon Age as you, Shane, and a lot of other people I know.

740
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,401
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks great.

741
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:18,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't let me down.

742
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:19,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for the reviews to come out.

743
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:24,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I let the reviews dictate, but it's a decent barometer.

744
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:27,347
[SPEAKER_02]: If all of the reviewers are saying, Duty...

745
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:33,350
[SPEAKER_02]: or a 10 out of 10 amazing, then it's a pretty decent barometer of where it's going to go.

746
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:42,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if they just pull all the reviews, pull all the review copies before it goes out, that always is a good sign as well.

747
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:44,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless that game gets delayed, which it did.

748
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:53,127
[SPEAKER_06]: The Lake House, Alan Wake 2's new expansion is coming in October and looks creepy.

749
01:05:53,428 --> 01:05:56,973
[SPEAKER_06]: At first I thought this was almost like a game based off of Cabin in the Woods.

750
01:05:57,293 --> 01:05:59,296
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the vibes were I was getting from that.

751
01:05:59,316 --> 01:06:01,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, holy, they're making a game based off Cabin in the Woods?

752
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:02,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Not an M. Night Shyamalan game.

753
01:06:04,212 --> 01:06:06,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Cabin in the Woods, wasn't it?

754
01:06:06,814 --> 01:06:07,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Whedon?

755
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of a different movie.

756
01:06:09,756 --> 01:06:10,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

757
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:11,157
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know what you're thinking.

758
01:06:11,297 --> 01:06:13,999
[SPEAKER_06]: You're thinking of... The Village?

759
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the one where the people show up and tell the gay couple they have to kill each other or all of humanity is going to die or something like that.

760
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:24,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, The Watchers or something like that.

761
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

762
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:27,169
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, it took place in the Cabin in the Woods.

763
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,063
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Hitman World of Assassination on PlayStation VR 2.

764
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:34,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Looked kind of cool.

765
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Not gonna lie.

766
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:50,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Kain Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered which leaked out early but you know they officially announced it as well so that's coming December 10th on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

767
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:55,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Fear the Spotlight is

768
01:06:57,566 --> 01:07:02,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently one of the new Blumhouse horror games that's being developed.

769
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:05,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember during Summer Game Fest when they announced that they were going to have all those games coming?

770
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:10,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 coming out October 22nd.

771
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:14,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Towers of Azaba.

772
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:19,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an island building game coming to early access in November.

773
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:23,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Fortnite is coming.

774
01:07:24,986 --> 01:07:34,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was already available on console, but they're going to be doing a Lego Fortnite DualSense controller or a Fortnite DualSense controller.

775
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:36,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

776
01:07:36,692 --> 01:07:38,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Split screen mode is coming to PlayStation 5.

777
01:07:39,576 --> 01:07:40,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

778
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:44,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can play a two-player LEGO Fortnite split screen on one system.

779
01:07:44,362 --> 01:07:50,190
[SPEAKER_06]: But then they're also doing a Fortnite DualSense controller, which is available for pre-order soon.

780
01:07:52,064 --> 01:08:15,419
[SPEAKER_02]: um and then Dynasty Warriors Sia Tiberius said it in chat and this is going to bug me if no one did Sia Tiberius says the movie I was thinking of is called Knock at the Cabin but it's based off a book called Cabin at the End of the World so the cabin cabin something close gotcha um not that I'm confused with Cabin Fever whole different movie um Dynasty Warriors Origins um

781
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:27,500
[SPEAKER_06]: it is a Dynasty Warriors game I can confirm that with the trailer that is coming out January 17th we got an extended trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds um

782
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:56,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for those people that like Monster Hunter I am not one of them unfortunately I never get into Monster Hunter games except Monster Hunter Now is so good like that is so fun to play with friends like and they the quality of life updates they've done in that this is a Niantic game like Pokemon Go but it's done it's done by the Niantic Japan so whatever studio they acquired they turned into Niantic Japan does the Monster Hunter Now game and when I tell you

783
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:24,973
[SPEAKER_02]: if you play Pokemon Go check out Monster Hunter now just to see what kind of quality of life features they have so you can be so fucking mad that they aren't in Pokemon Go because it's so good like anyway but the reason why I say that is it kind of makes me want to go play the mainline Monster Hunter games because the monsters all come from the mainline Monster Hunter games I'm like oh I could kind of get into this if this is what like the Monster Hunter mainline games are

784
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:53,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what's great is like all this talk about Monster Hunter and this and that we all forgot that Monster Hunter the movie was actually a thing but now you remember um I'll forget again thanks it's alright we'll all forget uh so Horizon um we got a new trailer for Lego Horizon Adventures which looks kinda cool uh that's gonna be coming out here very soon um

785
01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:08,413
[SPEAKER_06]: However, and this I think fits into that same camp of, you know, the remaster that we just had with The Last of Us, which is like, why are we remastering this again?

786
01:10:08,513 --> 01:10:12,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But Horizon Zero Dawn remastered is a thing that's coming out.

787
01:10:13,338 --> 01:10:16,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's being remastered just even though that game...

788
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: original PlayStation 4 game came out not that long ago however if you do own the original PlayStation 4 version you can just upgrade for $10 so at least that's good yeah that's good and the The Last of Us upgrades and all that and the other games they've gone back and done that with seem to do decently so I'm not really surprised I also think it's I think there's probably going to be PS5 Pro enhancements in that and that's what they really want to show off I think that's well they didn't really show yeah I don't know

789
01:10:46,387 --> 01:10:52,549
[SPEAKER_02]: The PS5 Pro didn't really land with us here at OLR, so I'm sure they're trying to put more and more into that wherever they can.

790
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:59,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the remaster is rumored to be coming to PC and PlayStation 5, so that'd be cool.

791
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:10,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Stellar Blade is getting a photo update as well as Nier Automata crossover collaboration content that's coming out later this year.

792
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:38,310
[SPEAKER_06]: we also got some more talk about PlayStation Plus which you're going to be able to get the Dead Space remake Doki Doki Literature Club WWE 2K24 as well as Blood Omen Legacy of Kain and Dino Crisis from the original PlayStation are going to be added to the Classic Collection The Last of Us Part 1 will be joining the PlayStation Plus game catalog

793
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:45,899
[SPEAKER_06]: already, as of Thursday, to commemorate The Last of Us Day, a made-up holiday.

794
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Chroma Collection.

795
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:57,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So PlayStation, they're going to have some console covers and controllers that are, like, shiny.

796
01:11:58,187 --> 01:12:00,968
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, like, a metallic purple, a metallic white.

797
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:03,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's kind of, like, iridescent.

798
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:06,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some metallic green color.

799
01:12:07,472 --> 01:12:08,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd look nice.

800
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't buy them, though.

801
01:12:10,058 --> 01:12:30,116
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh talking about PlayStation 5 Pro updates they listed some of the games they're going to be supporting uh new enhancements for PlayStation 5 Pro including you know Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Horizon Forbidden West, Last of Us Part II, Gran Turismo 7, Outlaw Wake 2 and so on and so forth lots of games um

802
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:57,123
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the big hey look at this we've got one more thing Ghost of Yotai and looks amazing so amazing so that Assassin's Creed got delayed wow the power the power it has to just knock Assassin's Creed into next year it's like oh this game looks awesome Assassin's Creed will be released in our game in February now is Ghost of Yotai coming out this year?

803
01:12:58,993 --> 01:13:00,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

804
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:02,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I assumed it was a 2025 game.

805
01:13:02,095 --> 01:13:04,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so what's Assassin's Creed running from?

806
01:13:04,056 --> 01:13:04,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 2025.

807
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:05,917
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Assassin's Creed running from then?

808
01:13:06,777 --> 01:13:07,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

809
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:11,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's because of that, but they had originally pulled review copies.

810
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:15,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Reviewers weren't going to get review copies, and then they delayed it.

811
01:13:16,343 --> 01:13:19,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that means, yeah, broken bugs.

812
01:13:19,785 --> 01:13:20,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, interesting.

813
01:13:21,165 --> 01:13:24,507
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster in chat says, Ghost of Yotei looks so good as a Ghost of Tsushima fan.

814
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

815
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

816
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:31,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks... That game, that right there, that's a perfect game to showcase.

817
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:32,394
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing, though.

818
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that quote on the back of the box.

819
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, OLR, it's a perfect game.

820
01:13:36,277 --> 01:13:36,958
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

821
01:13:36,998 --> 01:13:37,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on.

822
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:39,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not endorsing anything.

823
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

824
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:41,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

825
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:54,519
[SPEAKER_06]: What they showed off looks incredible, but the reason why... We don't know if that's PlayStation 5 Pro footage or PlayStation 5 footage.

826
01:13:54,879 --> 01:13:57,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is it... Oh, they said this is like PlayStation 5...

827
01:13:59,062 --> 01:14:03,925
[SPEAKER_06]: or PlayStation Pro footage or whatever like that, then that could possibly sell the console.

828
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: But it could be just that this is being shown off and make the assumption that it's a pro that's doing this and not the regular console.

829
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:12,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a safe assumption to make.

830
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:17,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything here on out at a Sony show that is in-game footage is being done on a pro.

831
01:14:17,713 --> 01:14:17,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Bet.

832
01:14:18,113 --> 01:14:20,835
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason for them not to.

833
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:23,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but what's it going to look like on a regular PlayStation 5 then?

834
01:14:23,136 --> 01:14:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

835
01:14:23,476 --> 01:14:24,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should they bother showing you?

836
01:14:26,218 --> 01:14:30,023
[SPEAKER_06]: because they still sell those consoles and I would like to know what it looks like.

837
01:14:30,404 --> 01:14:32,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be shelved away on a YouTube comparison video somewhere.

838
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:35,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it if you know where to look.

839
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:58,163
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah all right digital foundry waiting for your review lots of big game announcements this week with Tokyo Game Show and the Sony State of Play lots of big stuff to look forward to um and that's not even where the big news ends because we had another major development on another front on the Nintendo front and yes we're going to talk about the shoe and

840
01:14:58,323 --> 01:14:58,823
[SPEAKER_02]: PowerWorld.

841
01:14:58,863 --> 01:14:59,423
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

842
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:09,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The shoe showed up and said that it wasn't Gavin opening the ceiling and the microphones fall out.

843
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:09,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

844
01:15:09,906 --> 01:15:12,446
[SPEAKER_02]: A Nintendo opened a trap door and a shoe fell.

845
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's right.

846
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:14,787
[SPEAKER_02]: The other shoe, it finally dropped.

847
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:15,787
[SPEAKER_02]: On to PowerWorld thing.

848
01:15:16,347 --> 01:15:18,428
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember that back in January...

849
01:15:19,088 --> 01:15:23,471
[SPEAKER_02]: January, the Pokemon company said they were going to investigate PAL World.

850
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:26,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were sitting there going, oh, give it a few weeks.

851
01:15:26,793 --> 01:15:27,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.

852
01:15:28,094 --> 01:15:28,514
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

853
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:30,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And nothing ever kind of happened.

854
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:35,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of getting to the point where we were like, well, is Nintendo even going to do anything at this point?

855
01:15:35,138 --> 01:15:36,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here it is.

856
01:15:37,259 --> 01:15:47,506
[SPEAKER_02]: September 18th, Nintendo and the Pokemon company released a statement saying they are suing PAL World developer Pocket Pair on the grounds of patent infringement.

857
01:15:48,373 --> 01:15:56,577
[SPEAKER_02]: The full statement says, Nintendo, together with the Pokemon Company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court against Pocket Pair Inc.

858
01:15:56,978 --> 01:15:57,478
[SPEAKER_02]: on September 18, 2024.

859
01:15:57,918 --> 01:16:08,444
[SPEAKER_02]: The lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the defendant, infringes multiple patent rights.

860
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:09,564
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

861
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:34,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be something that's handled in the Japanese court.

862
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure why all the websites are going to American lawyers comment on it, but sure, we got that.

863
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,660
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

864
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:14,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pals in Palworld, some of them look very inspired by and in a questionable gray zone of legally distinct from Pokemon stuff.

865
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been some social media posts that really, like the people that opened the fucking models in Blender and shit and really took a deep dive to be like, yo, this is really close.

866
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:30,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that would be the stuff that Nintendo would latch onto and then take into court.

867
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:34,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does not appear what's happening at all because this is a patent lawsuit.

868
01:17:35,257 --> 01:17:38,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I'm not sure I get this.

869
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to explain why.

870
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, well, again, we don't know what patent – we do not know what patent it is.

871
01:17:44,843 --> 01:17:47,225
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of theories as to what patent it is.

872
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,926
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that have been doing some investigating trying to figure this out.

873
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:50,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most –

874
01:17:51,564 --> 01:17:52,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use your word, everybody.

875
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:53,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the shot glass ready.

876
01:17:54,145 --> 01:18:02,707
[SPEAKER_02]: The most plausible scenario is that it has to do with Pokemon's mechanic of basically throwing a ball at a monster.

877
01:18:03,027 --> 01:18:05,728
[SPEAKER_02]: The monster goes in the ball, and the ball is yours to keep.

878
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That, in a nutshell, and I'm paraphrasing, is the patent that Nintendo may have actually filed in the last year.

879
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing people are trying to figure out.

880
01:18:17,111 --> 01:18:18,912
[SPEAKER_02]: so that they could go after PAL World.

881
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is, well, it's weird to me that they're doing this and not the trademark copyright thing.

882
01:18:26,478 --> 01:18:31,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the fact that it's taken nine months, there's been a lot of meetings.

883
01:18:31,942 --> 01:18:35,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And for whatever reason, Nintendo's legal team feels like this is the way to go.

884
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:40,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But trust, if they went and filed a patent, if they decided to go about it this way,

885
01:18:42,445 --> 01:18:44,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Their problem is what the Pokemon look like.

886
01:18:44,706 --> 01:18:47,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I even called them Pokemon.

887
01:18:47,407 --> 01:18:47,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

888
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:50,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in court.

889
01:18:50,888 --> 01:18:53,149
[SPEAKER_02]: The pals look too much like Pokemon.

890
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real problem.

891
01:18:54,830 --> 01:19:00,152
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what everybody's pissed off about in Nintendo and Pokemon companies' world.

892
01:19:00,956 --> 01:19:17,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think it's a little bit dangerous for Nintendo to have that sort of patent on that mechanic because there's a lot of fan Pokemon games and things that have come out that are legally distinct enough from Pokemon that these are very clearly like...

893
01:19:18,483 --> 01:19:20,904
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pocket monster collecting games.

894
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:24,586
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made out of a love of Pokemon and that whole world.

895
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:26,187
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to infringe on anything.

896
01:19:26,507 --> 01:19:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be allowed to exist as well.

897
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:33,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And if Nintendo is able to kind of get Power World on that, I almost think it's a little bit dangerous.

898
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:38,554
[SPEAKER_02]: But just because I don't like it doesn't mean it isn't the way the world is going to work.

899
01:19:38,994 --> 01:19:40,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know what a great example of that is?

900
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,631
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

901
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:04,270
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of his, at the time he was doing a lot of mobile gaming projects.

902
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:06,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I ran into him at PAX and that's PAX East.

903
01:20:06,572 --> 01:20:11,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the whole thing started where we did the interview on the show and he was doing a lot of mobile games at the time.

904
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:23,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I say go listen to that interview, he talked a lot about patents and what Konami basically owned in the music space and

905
01:20:23,846 --> 01:20:25,547
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

906
01:20:47,233 --> 01:21:07,266
[SPEAKER_02]: and the default is that and it's five panel I'm inferring because again he hadn't created the game yet at the time but I'm inferring that's what because it's again to get distinct enough from that patent because in that whole experience if Konami really wants to go after you they will there was a lot of other music games they didn't go after but they went after that one

907
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:22,857
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know again I'm not trying to rehash old history but I can't help but see a little bit of a parallel here between that and if Konami really wants to shut the game down they will and what Nintendo is trying to do here with this whole thing.

908
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:25,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

909
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:29,646
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says episode 596 date May 3rd, 2015.

910
01:21:31,027 --> 01:21:33,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have to actually go to the OL Archive to find it.

911
01:21:34,049 --> 01:21:35,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's... Actually, no.

912
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:39,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our live... Actually, I want to say our server goes back to episode 500.

913
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:43,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might still actually live on our servers if you want to check that out.

914
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:45,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really, really good interview.

915
01:21:46,557 --> 01:21:50,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's a nine-year-old interview at this point, so keep that in mind.

916
01:21:50,559 --> 01:21:50,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's good.

917
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dark Tetsuya does remind us, by the way, the OLR wiki is back.

918
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:55,881
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a hold.

919
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:56,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

920
01:21:56,822 --> 01:21:57,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

921
01:21:57,563 --> 01:21:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: The OLR Wiki is back.

922
01:21:58,804 --> 01:22:00,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to DarkTetsuya.

923
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Bobby Blackwolf had a hand in that.

924
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:03,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I know OrangeRite has done some updating.

925
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:07,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to everybody who got the OLR Wiki back online.

926
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there was a transcript of a Travis Donovan spinoff show.

927
01:22:11,516 --> 01:22:29,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That they did not care for I know, I was like, once I heard Oh, it was a Travis Donovan show I was kind of like, what the fuck was a transcript Of one of his shows doing on the Not that, I love Travis, it's not that It's just, I know he says a lot of Back in the day, he said a lot of crude things And I was like, why was that living on the wiki anyway?

928
01:22:29,808 --> 01:22:39,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Travis We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him Please don't get me wrong But I'm just like The man is a living explicit tag Like

929
01:22:41,744 --> 01:22:42,244
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway.

930
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:43,986
[SPEAKER_01]: We love him more.

931
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:44,606
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

932
01:22:44,747 --> 01:22:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

933
01:22:45,187 --> 01:22:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

934
01:22:45,988 --> 01:22:50,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, RecoWN in chat says, sounds like there's a problem with games and patent law.

935
01:22:50,211 --> 01:22:50,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

936
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:54,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Patenting such specific ideas seems wild.

937
01:22:54,455 --> 01:22:54,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

938
01:22:54,935 --> 01:22:57,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that there's a problem with patent law, period.

939
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:04,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that whole thing, especially in light of the California law we talked about at the top of the show.

940
01:23:06,294 --> 01:23:14,077
[SPEAKER_02]: This really screams that this entire thing needs looked at because obviously the technology is evolving faster than the law is.

941
01:23:14,677 --> 01:23:19,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know why because the fucking politicians can't agree on shit.

942
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:23,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And they get paid to not care.

943
01:23:24,021 --> 01:23:31,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've got to figure this out because, well, and then of course I say that, but this issue was filed in Japan.

944
01:23:31,604 --> 01:23:33,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, it actually wouldn't matter.

945
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like when it comes to especially Hollywood-related things, it's kind of like the California law is going to change the way the rest of the country goes.

946
01:23:45,357 --> 01:23:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think it would be a bit bold to say a change in American law would change the way the rest of the world goes, but...

947
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: How about European laws?

948
01:23:54,979 --> 01:23:59,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the European technology laws are changing the way it goes for everybody else.

949
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It can happen.

950
01:24:02,021 --> 01:24:10,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there some laws that were in place in China or something like that that was about the loot box percentages, like the drop rates or something like that?

951
01:24:10,444 --> 01:24:11,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually feel like that was Belgium.

952
01:24:12,045 --> 01:24:15,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it was one of the across the Atlantic.

953
01:24:15,206 --> 01:24:16,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was China.

954
01:24:16,146 --> 01:24:20,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have been China too, but I want to say it was one of the across the Atlantic countries that did that.

955
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah had an effect so yeah yeah anyway it's going to be interesting to see where this ends up but the reality is hashtag it's complicated us armchair experts do not have an easy solution to this so I'm curious to see how this plays out but I will say as much as I think like look

956
01:24:44,727 --> 01:25:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple things can be true I can sit here and say I see how PowWorld is not Pokemon with guns and that hashtag did that game dirty or I should say that subtitle that a bunch of journalists slapped on that game that subtitle did that game dirty that game is not Pokemon with guns

957
01:25:02,128 --> 01:25:08,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that and notice this game is more of a survival-based game that kind of takes some of these mechanics and it does different things.

958
01:25:08,952 --> 01:25:11,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's not Pokemon at all, actually.

959
01:25:12,034 --> 01:25:19,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sit there and say that is true, but then I can also say, but damn, they lifted those monster graphics straight out of Pokemon and made changes to them.

960
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:20,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.

961
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:21,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

962
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,340
[SPEAKER_02]: They sure did.

963
01:25:24,061 --> 01:25:25,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not going to be convinced otherwise.

964
01:25:25,702 --> 01:25:25,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

965
01:25:26,923 --> 01:25:28,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Both those things can be true.

966
01:25:29,185 --> 01:25:38,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a little weird for me to go, it's weird that Nintendo is going to possibly go after them on the first of those things rather than the second.

967
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where this gets really muddy for me.

968
01:25:41,476 --> 01:25:48,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually, I'm not sure I want Nintendo to win that kind of patent lawsuit because what's that going to do to all the fan games?

969
01:25:49,122 --> 01:25:54,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point is, I think Nintendo does have a case against Palworld.

970
01:25:55,543 --> 01:25:57,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think this was the case.

971
01:25:58,988 --> 01:25:59,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not a lawyer.

972
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:01,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't fucking matter what I think.

973
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:10,580
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO and Hunter Matt says, yeah, this isn't Nintendo taking down a fun fan project remaking a Nintendo title.

974
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo has a case here.

975
01:26:12,461 --> 01:26:12,881
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

976
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:15,663
[SPEAKER_02]: But we see Nintendo going after a lot of the other stuff.

977
01:26:15,783 --> 01:26:19,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, with fan titles, fan titles is always a gray area, right?

978
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:27,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they go after some, you know, thing like that, like the music on YouTube and things like that, where it's just kind of like one of those, like, can't you just let it go?

979
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they go after these weird things sometimes.

980
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all know Nintendo can sometimes be overly litigious, right?

981
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:59,705
[SPEAKER_02]: and again, I think they've got a case against Palworld but in a different way but I think here's the thing, if they'd gone against just the monsters that lets Pocket Pair change out the monsters and still keep the game Nintendo wants their fucking head, that's what this is about Nintendo wants them to have to gut something that gets the game pulled completely

982
01:27:01,004 --> 01:27:02,365
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key difference here.

983
01:27:03,006 --> 01:27:04,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's going for their head.

984
01:27:05,067 --> 01:27:07,189
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to totally try to copy it is what they're going to do.

985
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:10,171
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to kill that game and then they're going to copy the mechanics of it.

986
01:27:10,532 --> 01:27:12,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Not with the guns, but the survival aspect.

987
01:27:12,753 --> 01:27:17,537
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be some new Pokemon game that has survival stuff and then they do that.

988
01:27:17,778 --> 01:27:18,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

989
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:19,859
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Loki?

990
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it.

991
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you are absolutely right.

992
01:27:23,402 --> 01:27:23,562
[SPEAKER_02]: or, or, or

993
01:27:40,492 --> 01:27:45,479
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have one in development, and they're worried that they're going to call the PAL world ripoff.

994
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're just trying to kill them.

995
01:27:48,322 --> 01:27:51,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, though, it's just petty to try to kill off another game company.

996
01:27:51,627 --> 01:27:54,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but to be fair to Nintendo...

997
01:27:55,552 --> 01:27:58,233
[SPEAKER_02]: That game company lifted the Pokemon.

998
01:27:58,253 --> 01:27:58,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's be real.

999
01:27:58,934 --> 01:27:59,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's fair.

1000
01:27:59,694 --> 01:28:00,815
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be only one.

1001
01:28:00,835 --> 01:28:01,395
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.

1002
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:06,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are a lot of companies that are blatantly trying to steal things and completely copy that.

1003
01:28:06,938 --> 01:28:14,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the other one we talked about that was basically like a survival game with a very strong Animal Crossing aesthetic to it.

1004
01:28:15,982 --> 01:28:16,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1005
01:28:16,663 --> 01:28:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, MikeDev does point out in chat, has some opinions here talking about, you know, Power World plays different than Pokemon and talking about we already have Legends Arceus.

1006
01:28:25,165 --> 01:28:25,885
[SPEAKER_02]: for fuck's sake.

1007
01:28:26,045 --> 01:28:28,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It has survival elements already.

1008
01:28:28,507 --> 01:28:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's something about Pokemon ZA that they want to do that they think Power World... Let's be real.

1009
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:39,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's just pissed off about the rampant success of Power World and wants to shut it down.

1010
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

1011
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:44,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think Nintendo has a case.

1012
01:28:44,775 --> 01:28:46,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't think they had this case.

1013
01:28:46,796 --> 01:28:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not a lawyer.

1014
01:28:47,537 --> 01:28:47,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Also,

1015
01:28:49,053 --> 01:29:10,796
[SPEAKER_01]: also make sure that your target has some blood in that stone to squeeze out that was something I said earlier in chat but I also think there's an advantage to waiting to see to gauge exactly what success and income is going to be off of that profit that they're making and then plan accordingly

1016
01:29:12,321 --> 01:29:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, real quick before we get to our next story, I want to mention another Nintendo lawsuit story.

1017
01:29:17,164 --> 01:29:23,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, even if this one you are angry at, you think it stifles competition or whatever, I think this next one we can all agree.

1018
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:26,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I am with Nintendo's lawyers on this.

1019
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:26,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1020
01:29:27,009 --> 01:29:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody out there will be contrarian.

1021
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am with Nintendo's lawyers on this one.

1022
01:29:30,471 --> 01:29:34,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is Nintendo is now apparently going after...

1023
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:39,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate calling it X, but since we're talking about a lawsuit... This is Twitter.

1024
01:29:39,464 --> 01:29:39,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Twitter.

1025
01:29:39,905 --> 01:29:40,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Twitter.

1026
01:29:41,205 --> 01:29:51,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But Nintendo is going after Twitter because it's Grok, the AI chatbot that's integrated into the Twitter X platform.

1027
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:58,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes AI-generated images, including images of Mario.

1028
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:06,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And Grock doesn't seem to have some of the same safety mechanisms in place that other AI programs and chatbots do.

1029
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:14,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually get it to do Mario to do things that Nintendo would not want to see Mario doing, like smoking, drinking.

1030
01:30:14,947 --> 01:30:19,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there are AI-generated images of Mario that were made on Grock that have been hit by

1031
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:49,121
[SPEAKER_02]: with DMCA takedowns those were handled by a company called Tracer which is supposedly doing this on Nintendo's behalf but of course there has been no comment at this time but this is the one where you go yeah this one makes sense so anyway I'm all for Nintendo taking Elon Musk's money do that get him get him get him alright

1032
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1033
01:30:52,024 --> 01:30:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about this next story about another company's leadership structure that needs to get got.

1034
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:01,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura, give us some light on this.

1035
01:31:04,975 --> 01:31:08,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, Ubisoft.

1036
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:19,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know really what to say about Ubisoft that we haven't already really said, but their shareholders are not good.

1037
01:31:24,231 --> 01:31:49,806
[SPEAKER_01]: so at any rate it actually is going to go back another step is that they had with poor sales of Star Wars Outlaws there are even more shadows that are just going over them they've had to postpone the release date of Assassin's Creed Shadows and they've taken a financial hit for all of this and Guillaumont has said that they had started an investigation

1038
01:31:50,926 --> 01:32:16,773
[SPEAKER_01]: uh looking better at their financial targets and how to better do a player-centric approach to all of you know their basically we just want to make we want their money we want their money also that they'll do an investigation for but not the um all the sexual harassment and mismanagement in the company there's more there's more um he put out a letter to the employees stating that um

1039
01:32:18,431 --> 01:32:32,226
[SPEAKER_01]: that he was trying to learn from a mistake to be a good motivation for future action and had talked about making changes in their upper management.

1040
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:51,542
[SPEAKER_01]: but the big thing is that investors are really loud about wanting to boot him out of the company like a big old boot to the ass and we agree but there's now a little bit more where 10% of the shareholders are supporting an option to sell the company

1041
01:32:53,243 --> 01:32:55,324
[SPEAKER_01]: sell to an outside source.

1042
01:32:55,805 --> 01:33:08,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was pretty much brought out by AJ Investments and the same company wanting the removal of Guillemot as a CEO.

1043
01:33:08,574 --> 01:33:13,457
[SPEAKER_01]: They managed to gain support from 10% of the company's shareholders to push this.

1044
01:33:13,497 --> 01:33:20,683
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to sell to, quote, external entities or as part of the so-called, quote, private equity for a pair price.

1045
01:33:21,503 --> 01:33:31,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So there hasn't been any announcement out there from either Gamont or from Tencent, the two highest shareholders of the company.

1046
01:33:31,954 --> 01:33:33,215
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll see what happens.

1047
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I find this news to be exciting, quite frankly.

1048
01:33:36,842 --> 01:33:48,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand this AJ Holdings may be some sort of activist shareholding company, but in this case, I'm all for this kind of activism because I really feel like what they are doing... We said this years ago.

1049
01:33:48,827 --> 01:33:58,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when Konami made all these shitty decisions back to back to back and we really landed on the whole, if you really want to affect change at a company, you're going to have to be a shareholder.

1050
01:33:58,431 --> 01:34:01,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And as SSJ100Matt puts it in chat, which is...

1051
01:34:01,852 --> 01:34:03,053
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1052
01:34:30,253 --> 01:34:30,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1053
01:34:46,404 --> 01:34:52,050
[SPEAKER_01]: QuestBuster in chat says Ubisoft has been trying to catch up with the rest of the industry for years

1054
01:35:03,101 --> 01:35:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: with extremely mixed results burning through so much talent and cash and let's be real there have been tons of shitty stories out of Ubisoft recently and I'm sorry to the front end employees that are working their ass off there you know trying to create good products I'm not saying like every Ubisoft game is shit but I am saying there are a lot of shit policies that are coming from the very top out of Ubisoft remember the thing about AI writing quests and dialogue and all that shit guess what company jumped onto that train early

1055
01:35:32,466 --> 01:35:32,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Choo Choo.

1056
01:35:33,006 --> 01:35:33,407
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1057
01:35:33,487 --> 01:35:35,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Ubisoft did that.

1058
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:48,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what company pulled the crew from sales so hard that now California has passed a law to make it so that that is going to be a bunch.

1059
01:35:48,636 --> 01:35:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be more transparent in the future.

1060
01:35:51,718 --> 01:35:52,238
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1061
01:35:52,378 --> 01:35:53,279
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ubisoft.

1062
01:35:53,859 --> 01:35:57,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they also forced an offline mode to be developed for the crew to

1063
01:35:59,029 --> 01:36:18,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Motorfest and The Crew 2 I think as well there is no easy way to put it and the shareholders need to hear it and congratulations to the 10% that have Yves Guillemont is the problem cut him out

1064
01:36:20,444 --> 01:36:22,226
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's not gonna happen, though.

1065
01:36:22,286 --> 01:36:28,172
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll let the company sink before they let them go unless they get an even bigger majority to push the issue.

1066
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:28,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 10% faith.

1067
01:36:31,721 --> 01:36:57,712
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe it'll grow by next week now of course it should be noted and I you might I just bolding underlining it the Gilmont's actually own a stake in Ubisoft that's going to make this whole thing a lot shittier and Tencent but they're the two biggest holders Tencent probably has a lot more money to buy out that stuff that share if they wanted to which I I feel is how this whole thing ends I think Tencent buys the rest of it out but we'll see we'll see what happens

1068
01:36:58,499 --> 01:37:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Gamonk gets a huge payout and that's gonna be the worst part oh god so angry so angry, alright, anyway let's talk about, we need to go visit a happy place, so Loki let's go to your happy place, let's go to Minecraft because Minecraft had some updates this week as well, right?

1069
01:37:19,775 --> 01:37:27,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Minecraft Live 2024 just was on Saturday, and they announced a few things.

1070
01:37:27,657 --> 01:37:44,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So, first thing they announced before all of this is that they're going to be focusing on smaller updates going forward instead of a larger themed update, which makes sense because the last few themed updates, they've been just putting stuff out and trying to... It's like, okay, we've got all these pieces...

1071
01:37:45,262 --> 01:37:46,843
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the picture that this makes?

1072
01:37:49,185 --> 01:37:50,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Tales and Trails?

1073
01:37:51,047 --> 01:37:51,887
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go!

1074
01:37:52,068 --> 01:37:56,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt very disjointed, some of the stuff that they would put out.

1075
01:37:57,092 --> 01:38:04,678
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it's focused on much smaller things, and some of these are called Game Drops now, these smaller updates.

1076
01:38:04,798 --> 01:38:13,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first Game Drop that's right around the corner is the Bundles of Bravery, and what that is is essentially...

1077
01:38:13,965 --> 01:38:18,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Bundles coming out of it being an experimental feature in the game.

1078
01:38:19,087 --> 01:38:22,128
[SPEAKER_06]: They have now dyeable colors of the bundles and everything.

1079
01:38:22,929 --> 01:38:25,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And hardcore mode for Bedrock.

1080
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:29,792
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I hope they fix all the bugs of that because that was so buggy.

1081
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:32,613
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's supposed to be coming out very soon.

1082
01:38:32,653 --> 01:38:34,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I think probably by the end of next month.

1083
01:38:36,883 --> 01:38:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, of course, the fun part, all of their announcements for the new biome got leaked.

1084
01:38:43,688 --> 01:38:47,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So, first, first, they leaked it themselves.

1085
01:38:47,951 --> 01:38:54,416
[SPEAKER_06]: They updated their page with the recap information for the event before it went live.

1086
01:38:54,897 --> 01:38:55,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopsie, everybody.

1087
01:38:56,898 --> 01:39:00,321
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually found it and posted about it online and stuff.

1088
01:39:01,181 --> 01:39:02,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it started to spread.

1089
01:39:02,763 --> 01:39:03,183
[SPEAKER_06]: But then...

1090
01:39:04,884 --> 01:39:30,311
[SPEAKER_06]: then later somebody who was in charge I think of subtitling the the after show video started leaking screenshots from the video and so there was that as well which basically leaked all of the announcements so what were those announcements a brand new biome to the game that's kind of a different take on the dark oak forest called the pale garden it's like a very desaturated uh

1091
01:39:32,062 --> 01:39:33,423
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1092
01:39:57,093 --> 01:40:05,700
[SPEAKER_06]: and um it's less of a dark black forest and more of a dark gray forest I guess um

1093
01:40:06,813 --> 01:40:27,528
[SPEAKER_06]: so you can't actually kill this mob you have to when you hit it it basically creates this like particle effect that points to a creaking heart which is within these trees so think of like the creaking as like a puppet and these trees are where are controlling it and so you can actually you have to take that heart out of the tree in order to be able to defeat the monster and

1094
01:40:28,328 --> 01:40:52,995
[SPEAKER_06]: and then um it has a new white wood type with like black bark which is it's all right but that's uh the the smaller drop that's going to be coming later on uh possibly within they said within the next few months they're also promising that they're going to be doing Minecraft lives instead of once a year it's going to be twice a year so the next one's going to be in the spring of 2025 and we'll hear more about that but more importantly we also heard about

1095
01:40:54,484 --> 01:41:03,547
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed a scene and a little bit of behind the scenes of the Minecraft movie, which I have to say did a better job of showcasing the Minecraft movie than the trailer that they had out.

1096
01:41:03,947 --> 01:41:13,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did get a little bit more context to the scene from the trailer where Jason Momoa's character is making something on the crafting table and makes some weird bucket thing with chains and stuff.

1097
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:18,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially Jason Momoa's character is supposed to be playing kind of like a...

1098
01:41:20,747 --> 01:41:46,126
[SPEAKER_06]: 80s video game champion type guy I think Billy Mitchell but now thrown into this world and he thinks he's like a know-it-all but doesn't really know anything not a fraud yeah and then of course there's like other characters the character Nathan who's the little boy he is like a maker kind of like a makerspace and maybe like a modder as well of Minecraft and

1099
01:41:46,669 --> 01:41:53,281
[SPEAKER_06]: and um I'm not sure who the the female character is or the the other two characters but um

1100
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:55,196
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to wait and see.

1101
01:41:55,416 --> 01:41:58,498
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was neat to see all the behind-the-scenes stuff.

1102
01:41:58,638 --> 01:42:01,941
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Weta working on the props and everything.

1103
01:42:01,981 --> 01:42:02,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks really cool.

1104
01:42:04,002 --> 01:42:08,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Up close, they're showing all the physical props in the movie.

1105
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:09,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked really, really cool.

1106
01:42:10,187 --> 01:42:11,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm kind of excited about it.

1107
01:42:11,788 --> 01:42:12,268
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1108
01:42:12,528 --> 01:42:18,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it still could be kind of dumb, but a little bit more confident since they are working with

1109
01:42:19,193 --> 01:42:45,516
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Mojang and content creators that are really fans of Minecraft and just to make sure that they've got the right feeling for the movie so we'll see give it give it some you know chance um and then last thing was there's gonna be a live experience for Minecraft an interactive experience uh starting in Dallas called uh Minecraft Villager Rescue and it is like these interactive rooms that can go in and they have all these uh different videos projected onto the wall and you can kind of interact with them

1110
01:42:46,096 --> 01:42:47,657
[SPEAKER_06]: in real life, so that's kind of cool.

1111
01:42:48,317 --> 01:42:56,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, coming first to Dallas and then not sure if it's going to be coming to other locales later on, but maybe.

1112
01:42:56,782 --> 01:42:58,143
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to wait and see.

1113
01:42:59,204 --> 01:43:03,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of stuff, but yeah, it's interesting.

1114
01:43:03,306 --> 01:43:04,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1115
01:43:04,607 --> 01:43:10,190
[SPEAKER_06]: The new biome and stuff is kind of alright, but we'll see what other stuff comes out a little bit later on.

1116
01:43:12,271 --> 01:43:12,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1117
01:43:12,972 --> 01:43:14,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting stuff ahead for Minecraft.

1118
01:43:16,633 --> 01:43:31,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about a game that's excited a lot of people this weekend We have yet to talk about Zelda Echoes of Wisdom which just came out over this weekend I think it released Thursday night, Friday So I think some of you in chat have probably had a chance to play it Very curious what those of you in chat think about it

1119
01:43:32,071 --> 01:43:35,453
[SPEAKER_02]: As we are taping live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1120
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're getting to hear a little bit about some of the development behind the scenes about this game, Zelda Echoes of Wisdom.

1121
01:43:41,196 --> 01:43:50,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had no idea about this, but did you know that the director for this game is Tomomi Sano, who would now be the first female director of a Zelda game?

1122
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:52,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that with this, so that's pretty cool.

1123
01:43:53,683 --> 01:43:58,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And recently she did a Ask the Developer blog with, of course...

1124
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:06,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Anuma, the producer behind the game, and Grezzo, which I think is another studio that helped with this game, Satoshi Terada.

1125
01:44:07,069 --> 01:44:13,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were talking a little bit about the development of the game and how originally in developing this game, Link was going to be the protagonist.

1126
01:44:14,313 --> 01:44:23,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But in developing the game, it was realized that if Link still has a sword and shield, why would the echoes and the new concepts be something that was used?

1127
01:44:24,164 --> 01:44:28,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in a quote, Tarada from Grezzo said...

1128
01:44:28,889 --> 01:44:32,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Echoes plus a sword and shield, it just didn't work well together.

1129
01:44:32,412 --> 01:44:37,597
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a wide variety of Echoes, so to get the most out of the gameplay, we decided to stick with Echoes only.

1130
01:44:38,218 --> 01:44:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Anuma kind of tagging onto that said, if that's the case, it must be someone who doesn't fight with a sword and shield, right?

1131
01:44:45,564 --> 01:44:49,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Who in the series would be a good fit for those powers and bring their insight to them?

1132
01:44:49,388 --> 01:44:50,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that would have to be Princess Zelda.

1133
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1134
01:45:10,097 --> 01:45:13,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And they admit, you know, there's been that feedback over the years.

1135
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Princess Zelda ever be the protagonist?

1136
01:45:16,279 --> 01:45:17,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to play as Princess Zelda.

1137
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:26,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And in response, Anuma said, when asked this question, I've always thought, of course, as long as it makes sense for the game and does justice to her as a character to be the protagonist.

1138
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:30,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd been trying in vain to figure out what would really do justice to her.

1139
01:45:30,964 --> 01:45:38,006
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I saw the team struggling to identify the ideal protagonist for this game, I thought, this is exactly the game for her.

1140
01:45:38,846 --> 01:45:40,107
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1141
01:45:54,355 --> 01:45:59,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the timeline and all that stuff is that important to the game's success, and is it fun?

1142
01:45:59,617 --> 01:46:03,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is interesting to hear about the types of things that they have to consider in making the game.

1143
01:46:03,698 --> 01:46:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm excited to check out the game.

1144
01:46:05,518 --> 01:46:07,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a Nintendo voucher, and I plan to use it on this game.

1145
01:46:08,879 --> 01:46:11,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you can get the two vouchers for that whole thing.

1146
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still have one, actually.

1147
01:46:12,961 --> 01:46:14,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to use it to get this.

1148
01:46:15,121 --> 01:46:18,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I picked it up, but my son's been playing it.

1149
01:46:18,742 --> 01:46:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: How's he been liking it?

1150
01:46:20,763 --> 01:46:21,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's been liking it.

1151
01:46:21,703 --> 01:46:23,364
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been playing more Mario Kart than anything.

1152
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:25,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he likes it.

1153
01:46:25,851 --> 01:46:28,654
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says, the game has a bit of a learning curve, but it's fun.

1154
01:46:29,214 --> 01:46:32,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Sia says, I think Grezzo also did the Link's Awakening remake.

1155
01:46:32,798 --> 01:46:38,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and that's why, quite frankly, they probably look very similar, that they're in a very similar engine.

1156
01:46:38,623 --> 01:46:41,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's a reason for that, but that's okay.

1157
01:46:41,326 --> 01:46:41,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

1158
01:46:42,407 --> 01:46:45,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not bothered by that like that's how a lot of games used to be made.

1159
01:46:46,212 --> 01:46:58,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby was talking about this on his show tonight early on as he was talking about how they made a new Yakuza like a dragon game so fast, because they basically reused a lot of assets from the last game but guess what, that's how they used to make games.

1160
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:28,452
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it's as long as the story is good and a lot you know they can change enough to make it still feel like something really special and I think that's just fine I also take a look at Majora's Mask is basically a lot of the same shit as Ocarina of Time it doesn't matter it's still a great game on its own so you know that's that's okay I don't mind them I don't mind the fact it looks a lot like the Link's Awakening remake so I'll still check it out anyway let's go to you DarkSakra

1161
01:47:30,249 --> 01:47:52,135
[SPEAKER_01]: well we are uh well people need to be held accountable especially companies that abuse their uh their assets that abuse uh their artists that work with them the League of Legends um the uh

1162
01:47:53,985 --> 01:48:03,392
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in the middle of a dispute with the Hollywood Actors Union and an audio company that provides voiceover services for the game.

1163
01:48:05,213 --> 01:48:20,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So SAG-AFTRA is involved in this one as a strike against League of Legends on Tuesday, saying that Formosa Interactive, the company, is trying to get around the ongoing video game strike by hiring non-union actors to work on another unrelated title.

1164
01:48:22,505 --> 01:48:50,343
[SPEAKER_01]: and so yeah, they're like hey, we want some scabbies but it's bad enough I think that they are trying to they're wanting to refuse agreement about fair AI usage you know

1165
01:48:51,428 --> 01:49:17,795
[SPEAKER_01]: but now they're trying to go behind everybody's uh everybody's uh back to try to do this in fact the quote is to commit illegal unfair labor practices is beyond the pale and won't be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members yeah don't do the don't do the scab work if you're an aspiring voice actor you'll be blacklisted you'll regret that don't do it you will totes be blacklisted um and on top of that you know um

1166
01:49:20,517 --> 01:49:48,233
[SPEAKER_01]: people should have their body of work protected and not have their voice likeness be added to a database to just be used willy nilly it's like if I do graphic work for somebody it's only meant to be used for that purpose unless I have specifically licensed it for use of another purpose it's absolutely ridiculous and then on top of that now

1167
01:49:49,326 --> 01:50:01,412
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been so many layoffs that companies are outsourcing like that to try to keep their workload up with the demand for product.

1168
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:18,377
[SPEAKER_01]: and other companies are seeing, you know, this behavior, this sort of going around behind the back as also a damage to their reputations and their ethics.

1169
01:50:19,098 --> 01:50:27,406
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are risks for all companies because a few of them are doing this thing, you know, the bad apple analogy, right?

1170
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:53,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Riot Games is saying that they have nothing to do with the complaint but it's just that that specific aspect has been working with Formosa to they're basically saying that they're engaging with the union to try to resolve things and not

1171
01:50:55,783 --> 01:50:57,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Go Behind Anyone's Back.

1172
01:50:57,264 --> 01:51:00,587
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they never asked Formosa to cancel a game that they've registered.

1173
01:51:02,129 --> 01:51:07,914
[SPEAKER_01]: SAG-AFTRA is saying that this is related to a non-riot game, so they don't really have anything to do with it.

1174
01:51:10,905 --> 01:51:28,182
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're saying that members must immediately stop providing covered services to League of Legends and they are pretty stuck on this one Formosa is a union signatory on here so they are bound by this

1175
01:51:28,863 --> 01:51:33,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, this is a good reminder that the strike is still going on, too.

1176
01:51:33,046 --> 01:51:35,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about it in a couple months, but it's still going on.

1177
01:51:36,169 --> 01:51:45,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And there still has not been movement for the gaming companies to meet the actors at the table.

1178
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting because something that happened... So we've been gone for two weeks because of TwitchCon and everything, right?

1179
01:51:51,000 --> 01:52:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: in that first week we were off I believe there's been a lot of AI stuff that got past legislation and like I know today something the governor vetoed about AI but I think that had to do with some type of like how the companies work but something that passed a couple weeks ago the governor signed was an it was a protecting Hollywood actors and performers from unauthorized AI and

1180
01:52:13,075 --> 01:52:41,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital Clone Law so again California with this law is going to be you know and let's be real every media company has some type of presence in California so they're going to have to and other states will follow soon enough you know are going to have to follow this law so it's weird to me that this didn't end the strike right there like the studios are going to have to give on I realize there's other things they're still working on too but the studios have to give on this AI thing there is no choice now it is now being legislated

1181
01:52:42,731 --> 01:53:10,844
[SPEAKER_01]: yep so I mean that's gonna they're gonna have to come to the table and honestly enough it really I think I think it's the strike that pushed the legislation it needed to happen and this is the second one over over this that I recall maybe third or definitely definitely at least there was one before this that they come to that resolution and then companies sort of went around it and did their business as usual anyway yeah

1182
01:53:12,813 --> 01:53:14,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be interesting to see what develops from this.

1183
01:53:14,754 --> 01:53:17,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, don't do the scab work.

1184
01:53:17,076 --> 01:53:17,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll regret it.

1185
01:53:18,777 --> 01:53:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1186
01:53:19,917 --> 01:53:20,217
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1187
01:53:21,438 --> 01:53:21,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1188
01:53:21,959 --> 01:53:23,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple more stories for you.

1189
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:28,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to go back real quick on a tangent regarding that last story.

1190
01:53:28,282 --> 01:53:28,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1191
01:53:28,563 --> 01:53:33,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you guys seen any of the stuff from the new ChatGPT update with the voice?

1192
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:46,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a TikTok in my algorithm with a guy talking to the chat GPT thing going, I want you to talk to me like you're my gay best friend, my sister or something.

1193
01:53:46,851 --> 01:53:53,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the voice, like it's so funny to hear saying these things, but it's just, it's ridiculous and silly.

1194
01:53:53,374 --> 01:54:01,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Although the one I was seeing, there was one that they were getting, it was getting angry and it started cloning the person's voice when it was responding to them.

1195
01:54:03,223 --> 01:54:05,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it was, like, sounding like them.

1196
01:54:05,304 --> 01:54:07,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, that's concerning.

1197
01:54:08,046 --> 01:54:08,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.

1198
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:13,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1199
01:54:16,032 --> 01:54:17,853
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why that can all sit up.

1200
01:54:18,774 --> 01:54:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where it's like...

1201
01:54:22,955 --> 01:54:25,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It can sit over there in a box and I don't want to touch it.

1202
01:54:25,276 --> 01:54:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, on a professional level as a tool, we're going to have to touch it like it or not.

1203
01:54:31,819 --> 01:54:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: But those borders are going to have to get drawn fast.

1204
01:54:36,701 --> 01:54:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always been with the whole AI can be a tool for art.

1205
01:54:41,743 --> 01:54:43,464
[SPEAKER_02]: AI is not a replacement for art.

1206
01:54:44,731 --> 01:55:12,954
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think we see the legislation is starting to kind of fill in the gaps the same way but it's going to be interesting to see how that all shakes out but that's freaky be very careful what you it's actually a good lesson too and be careful the data you're giving those things to be quite honest read carefully what you are agreeing to when you use these types of things so anyway but read Rob that means people have to take personal responsibility

1207
01:55:14,076 --> 01:55:14,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Who does that anymore?

1208
01:55:16,319 --> 01:55:17,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I read about it in a book.

1209
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I had ChatGPT summarize a book for me that talked about it at some point.

1210
01:55:23,046 --> 01:55:24,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you have next for us in gaming news?

1211
01:55:25,822 --> 01:55:26,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, this is kind of fun.

1212
01:55:27,964 --> 01:55:36,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may remember like with Helldivers, there's the big old controversy about having the required PlayStation Network account in order to be able to play the game.

1213
01:55:36,693 --> 01:55:43,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now, God of War, Ragnarok, has the same issue on PC.

1214
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:48,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It does require you to have a PlayStation Network account, but I think if you're only playing like the

1215
01:55:49,746 --> 01:55:50,827
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing the Lord's work.

1216
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:32,771
[SPEAKER_06]: so they did put out the mod however they did take it down from Nexus Mods not because they were asked to but because they were worried that it was becoming so popular they were worried they were going to get a legal threat from Sony so they have taken it down but what's on the internet always on the internet so it's neat that they found a way to kind of get around that good job modders

1217
01:56:33,584 --> 01:56:50,085
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done it again I think we all need to take a moment you need to thank your local modder take a minute, thank your local modder because, you know, and I was even talking about it earlier in the show with the retro achievements and all that stuff like, a lot of modders are really making this industry better

1218
01:56:50,686 --> 01:56:52,047
[SPEAKER_02]: to be fair.

1219
01:56:52,107 --> 01:56:52,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of them.

1220
01:56:53,028 --> 01:57:04,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes developers, though, sort of indirectly work with the modders, like the whole thing about the custom kit for Baldur's Gate 3, pretty much being left in there for someone to decode.

1221
01:57:04,776 --> 01:57:08,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is a little bit different than Ghost of Tsushima, which did have a multiplayer mode.

1222
01:57:08,599 --> 01:57:11,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think, actually, God of War Ragnarok has a multiplayer mode.

1223
01:57:11,461 --> 01:57:12,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Ragnarok does, no.

1224
01:57:13,003 --> 01:57:15,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a single-player online game, so... I...

1225
01:57:19,375 --> 01:57:19,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1226
01:57:20,016 --> 01:57:20,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they do this.

1227
01:57:22,597 --> 01:57:23,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen... Was it screenshots?

1228
01:57:24,379 --> 01:57:30,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess it's kind of typical with all these other logins and loaders and stuff like that where there was a screenshot.

1229
01:57:30,563 --> 01:57:31,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on Reddit today, actually.

1230
01:57:32,024 --> 01:57:32,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It was talking about...

1231
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:52,331
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the Tom Clancy games someone had purchased on Steam and the Ubisoft client was saying that they hadn't purchased the game and so they wouldn't let them play the game and they're like you have to contact customer service shouldn't have to do any of that because this launcher shouldn't exist but cool

1232
01:57:53,297 --> 01:58:11,907
[SPEAKER_02]: well uh we're gonna get to the classic game of the week in a moment but we have a nice little segue here we need to go back to uh some games that they didn't connect to the internet they only connected to a television with a tube and a big fat butt via a coaxial cable uh that is of course the atari 2600

1233
01:58:13,127 --> 01:58:13,647
[SPEAKER_02]: and friends.

1234
01:58:13,908 --> 01:58:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a collection not that long ago called Atari 50 that's pretty darn good and set the stage for Digital Eclipse's Gold Master Series that started with Karateka and Jeff Minter is going to continue with Tetris.

1235
01:58:28,054 --> 01:58:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't checked out Atari 50, it's a pretty good time to revisit because the first DLC just dropped a few days ago called The Wider World of Atari which includes now 19 new playable games and

1236
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:42,701
[SPEAKER_02]: and 8 video segments.

1237
01:58:43,161 --> 01:58:45,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a new download content you can check out.

1238
01:58:45,702 --> 01:58:49,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of two DLCs that you're going to be able to check out.

1239
01:58:49,683 --> 01:58:52,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The next DLC, which isn't dated yet, but it's going to... Oh, I'm sorry.

1240
01:58:52,984 --> 01:58:53,564
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is dated.

1241
01:58:53,644 --> 01:58:54,905
[SPEAKER_02]: November 8th, actually.

1242
01:58:55,225 --> 01:59:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So only a few more weeks before you get to do the first Console War, which is going to cover Atari versus Intellivision, which is really funny now because Atari owns Intellivision.

1243
01:59:07,489 --> 01:59:09,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be very interesting.

1244
01:59:09,171 --> 01:59:12,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people that were involved with Intellivision in the heyday, unfortunately, have passed away.

1245
01:59:13,776 --> 01:59:16,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure there's archival interviews and things that they will draw from.

1246
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:21,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, back to focusing on this first DLC, talking about the wider world of Atari.

1247
01:59:21,965 --> 01:59:23,087
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually get some different...

1248
01:59:24,588 --> 01:59:37,734
[SPEAKER_02]: videos including unusual and underappreciated innovations for the 2600, hidden gems for the 1980s, a spotlight on Evelyn Seto who created Atari's iconic logo.

1249
01:59:38,655 --> 01:59:40,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a thread on Blue Sky.

1250
01:59:40,776 --> 01:59:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently somebody from Digital Eclipse ran into her at some type of

1251
01:59:45,598 --> 02:00:06,390
[SPEAKER_02]: launch or something for some type of industry meetup celebrating Atari and she was like yeah I made Atari's logo and it was like we should probably interview you and so they did and so it's in the DLC I think that's kind of funny um it also is apparently pretty community heavy talking about unreleased prototypes and the preservation of gaming history

1252
02:00:06,755 --> 02:00:11,960
[SPEAKER_02]: and then archival and contemporary interviews from employees, fans and homebrew developers.

1253
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool too.

1254
02:00:13,681 --> 02:00:15,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to check this out.

1255
02:00:15,563 --> 02:00:19,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked out the original Atari 50 release, but I want to take the deep dive on the DLC.

1256
02:00:20,167 --> 02:00:23,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to quickly tell you some of the games that are in the expansion.

1257
02:00:23,229 --> 02:00:23,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Prototypes.

1258
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:37,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Berserk for the 2600, the voice enhanced Berserk, which was a fan game, which that fan ended up being the CEO of Digital Eclipse, which Bobby had talked to me about on his show tonight, which I never knew.

1259
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:37,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.

1260
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:39,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That is also on the 2600.

1261
02:00:40,782 --> 02:00:49,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Berserk on the 5200, Berserk for the arcade, Frenzy, Red Baron, Skydiver, Avalanche, Destroyer, Superbug, Football, all for the arcade.

1262
02:00:50,326 --> 02:00:55,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sears exclusives, Stellar Track, Submarine Commander, and Steeplechase.

1263
02:00:55,308 --> 02:00:57,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Steeplechase all in the 2600.

1264
02:00:57,649 --> 02:01:05,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Atari Video Cube, Desert Falcon, Off the Wall, Skydiver for the 2600, and Avalanche for Atari 8-bit.

1265
02:01:05,612 --> 02:01:06,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

1266
02:01:06,913 --> 02:01:08,413
[SPEAKER_02]: $7.99 is the price for that. $7.99.

1267
02:01:10,285 --> 02:01:10,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.

1268
02:01:11,325 --> 02:01:15,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So props, props to the game preservation efforts on that.

1269
02:01:15,146 --> 02:01:16,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really cool.

1270
02:01:16,127 --> 02:01:18,807
[SPEAKER_02]: They're literally building a virtual museum and I think it's so cool to see.

1271
02:01:18,887 --> 02:01:19,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to them.

1272
02:01:20,068 --> 02:01:20,328
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1273
02:01:20,828 --> 02:01:26,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been building a virtual museum of our own with this segment through DarkSakura each and every week.

1274
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's roll the bumper.

1275
02:01:38,283 --> 02:01:45,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1276
02:01:46,027 --> 02:01:48,569
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1277
02:01:50,276 --> 02:01:51,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked Wing Commander.

1278
02:02:12,185 --> 02:02:15,846
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first Wing Commander in the series.

1279
02:02:16,767 --> 02:02:23,329
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a spaceflight simulation franchise by Origin Systems.

1280
02:02:23,429 --> 02:02:27,711
[SPEAKER_01]: It was first released for MS-DOS on September 26, 1990 and had ports to Amiga, CD32, Sega CD...

1281
02:02:35,534 --> 02:02:49,632
[SPEAKER_01]: the Super Nintendo and then a re-release as Wing Commander 1 in 1994 for PC and enhanced remake Super Wing Commander for the 3DO in 1994 that was also later ported to the Mac

1282
02:02:51,688 --> 02:03:10,264
[SPEAKER_01]: their expansion missions there was Wing Commander The Secret Missions November 1990 and Wing Commander The Secret Missions 2 Crusade in March 1991 this was like the real big push that that genre needed it was considered a

1283
02:03:10,704 --> 02:03:15,506
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best space dogfight games.

1284
02:03:15,606 --> 02:03:21,729
[SPEAKER_01]: It had great graphics, audio, a story campaign that people would often compare to Star Wars.

1285
02:03:22,929 --> 02:03:26,771
[SPEAKER_01]: People were even referring to it as World War II in space.

1286
02:03:28,851 --> 02:03:33,293
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a massive cast.

1287
02:03:33,313 --> 02:03:37,335
[SPEAKER_01]: You had your multinational cast of pilots for the Terran Confederation.

1288
02:03:38,195 --> 02:04:01,100
[SPEAKER_01]: you had uh you know your aliens that you're against the Kelrathi which were a feline race um but yeah um as I said it is a space flight simulation game where you pilot a ship and complete missions you engage enemy ships uh you know various strengths and weaknesses and uh they're

1289
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:05,901
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an AI-controlled wingman that you can give orders to.

1290
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:15,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Your missions will have different objectives, but you can proceed even if you fail, just as long as you live.

1291
02:04:17,404 --> 02:04:24,186
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a branching, open-ended story, you get promotions and rank, you progress, you get better ships.

1292
02:04:25,606 --> 02:04:30,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, if you fail objectives, you'll get more difficult missions and inferior ships.

1293
02:04:32,068 --> 02:04:58,864
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a losing path that can work back to the winning path or you can fall off the winning path and go to the losing path and your wingmen can be killed permanently in combat and be gone the rest of the campaign and with the secret missions they don't have branching open-ended paths and you have to successfully complete the core missions of that game so you are

1294
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:10,685
[SPEAKER_01]: In the first game, you are a nameless pilot, although in the sequels, they're referred to as Christopher Blair fighting on the TCS Tiger's Claw.

1295
02:05:11,925 --> 02:05:16,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And you name your pilot, you choose your call sign.

1296
02:05:16,748 --> 02:05:16,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1297
02:05:18,779 --> 02:05:46,235
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the in-production I can't make words happen the pilot who is known to the origin personnel as Blue Hair just goes up through the ranks and then you get all kinds of stuff happen I don't really want to go too much into the overall story but you do have two endings with the winning path considered to be the canon path by the game expansion packs and lead into Wing Commander 2 Vengeance of the Calrathi

1298
02:05:49,913 --> 02:05:57,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the secret missions, you go through the Goddard system where you have a distress call.

1299
02:05:58,478 --> 02:06:04,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you arrive, the colony that you're trying to rescue is nothing but, you know, a mess, all dead, blah, blah.

1300
02:06:06,061 --> 02:06:10,926
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to go against a Gravitron weapon and we'll keep going back from there.

1301
02:06:12,528 --> 02:06:17,674
[SPEAKER_01]: More special secret stuff going in on the secret missions to Crusade.

1302
02:06:19,857 --> 02:06:20,558
[SPEAKER_01]: You have...

1303
02:06:22,748 --> 02:06:35,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Missing characters that you need to figure out what happened to them and also like a life sacrifice religious festival that you need to break up or something.

1304
02:06:37,651 --> 02:07:05,274
[SPEAKER_01]: and then going even further than that one of my favorite writers Mercedes Lackey along with Ellen Guion did the first Wing Commander novel which was Wing Commander Freedom Flight and that's pretty cool I've been reading Mercedes Lackey for years and then let's not forget there was Super Wing Commander which was a big push on that as

1305
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:18,215
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from the mission that led the Tiger's Claw to track down the shipyards that were responsible for creating the Seaver Dreadnought.

1306
02:07:18,235 --> 02:07:21,737
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different elements going in and it really pushes the story a bit further.

1307
02:07:23,218 --> 02:07:28,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got four stars out of five for the 3DO that said that it was what it was intended to be.

1308
02:07:29,262 --> 02:07:31,843
[SPEAKER_01]: A straightforward space simulator with an arcade spin.

1309
02:07:32,904 --> 02:07:33,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey-hoo!

1310
02:07:34,451 --> 02:07:34,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

1311
02:07:35,772 --> 02:07:38,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it was just a sneeze.

1312
02:07:40,036 --> 02:07:50,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was originally called Squadron and later renamed to Wing Leader and then eventually they said that there would be...

1313
02:07:54,060 --> 02:08:00,103
[SPEAKER_01]: The EM386 memory manager the game used would give an exception when a user exited the game.

1314
02:08:00,584 --> 02:08:21,957
[SPEAKER_01]: It would print out a message similar to EM386 memory manager error with additional information and then someone Ken Demarest Hex edited the memory manager so it sent a different message and so the error message said thank you for playing Wing Commander and basically they

1315
02:08:22,617 --> 02:08:28,883
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to remove the workaround once they fixed the problem, but Wing Commander is the title.

1316
02:08:30,164 --> 02:08:32,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It was shipped in 1990 for PC DOS.

1317
02:08:33,227 --> 02:08:37,390
[SPEAKER_01]: It had an instruction booklet that looked like a shipboard magazine called Clawmarks.

1318
02:08:40,277 --> 02:09:05,911
[SPEAKER_01]: it had uh just all kinds of neat stuff in it um you could get the mission packs like the secret missions like I was mentioning before and like I said there were lots of ports we had the SNES we had Amiga we had Amiga CD 32 the Sega CD 1994 a Mega Drive version was intended to use the the ACIC graphics chip but never was released um

1319
02:09:07,112 --> 02:09:15,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Wing Commander was retroactively renamed Wing Commander 1 as a bundle with Wing Commander 2 in preparation for the release of Wing Commander 3, Heart of the Tiger.

1320
02:09:15,895 --> 02:09:19,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't Wing Commander 3 the one that had Mark Hamill in it?

1321
02:09:19,376 --> 02:09:20,136
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure was.

1322
02:09:20,996 --> 02:09:21,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, it was.

1323
02:09:23,977 --> 02:09:37,281
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we had a later port to Windows 95 again re-released with Wing Commander 2 and Wing Commander 3, Heart of the Tiger which was all known as Wing Commander, the Karathi Saga

1324
02:09:40,296 --> 02:10:03,270
[SPEAKER_01]: the secret missions um all all reported and the secret mission add-ons uh are they were all available you actually apparently you can download them from Origin's website I think is how that went um Super Wing Commander came out on 3DO and Mac it was like I said a pretty enhanced and exceptional version of the game and then um

1325
02:10:05,385 --> 02:10:34,012
[SPEAKER_01]: it was basically the game that really rose the bar for a genre and it established sort of an action shooter genre as a viable contender EA ported the SNES version to PS Portable as a part of EA Replay this is in 2006 and then in August 2011 the Wing Commander PC version was re-released onto GOG

1326
02:10:35,012 --> 02:10:49,299
[SPEAKER_01]: the lost source code for Wing Commander was given to the fan community that year by a former developer to preserve the game that's awesome it had been

1327
02:10:51,623 --> 02:10:55,506
[SPEAKER_01]: It's contemporaries it was competing with was LucasArts X-Wing.

1328
02:10:56,266 --> 02:11:02,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Magazine even rated the game, giving it a 6 out of 5 stars, which I think is funny.

1329
02:11:05,053 --> 02:11:15,140
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this game, like some of its awards, it won the 1991 Game of the Year from Computer Gaming World and also the Hall of Fame.

1330
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:36,487
[SPEAKER_01]: and the 7 best PC games of all time and the 15 best ways to die all by the same publication Time gave it the title of one of the 100 best video games of all time PC Format said 50 best computer games of all time and PC Gamer US number 23 best game of all time

1331
02:11:37,707 --> 02:11:48,873
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Sega CD version got a pretty great review from GamePro back in the day for having great digitized speech and pretty decent cinematic animation.

1332
02:11:49,133 --> 02:11:51,215
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it gave them the feel of a space opera.

1333
02:11:53,296 --> 02:12:00,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So without going too much into a lot more on that one, as for how it sold by February 1995, it had sold around 290,000 copies.

1334
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:27,976
[SPEAKER_01]: and this was considered to be one of the first examples of a game referred to as interactive cinema and there you go Wing Commander we just need to take a moment to really explain how important this game was in gaming's history especially on the PC front um

1335
02:12:29,213 --> 02:12:55,047
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really fucking important there you go this game was huge there's so much of my youth many hours that I lost to this game and the several sequels you talked about there even watching this footage now has taken me way back as it is many of the people in chat it's pretty incredible great pick but maybe I'm a little biased Wing Commander love it

1336
02:12:56,121 --> 02:12:57,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Horror Picture Show Video Game Coming Out

1337
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:27,160
[SPEAKER_06]: from Freak Zone Games.

1338
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:30,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a retro style action platformer.

1339
02:13:30,361 --> 02:13:31,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordering right now.

1340
02:13:31,701 --> 02:13:36,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm going to be very nitpicky on one point just as somebody who is a huge fan of this stuff.

1341
02:13:36,622 --> 02:13:41,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a Rocky Horror Show adaptation, not picture show.

1342
02:13:41,303 --> 02:13:45,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I make that distinction is because the Rocky Horror Show was the play.

1343
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:45,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1344
02:13:46,464 --> 02:13:51,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Rocky Horror Show also had that original

1345
02:13:51,445 --> 02:13:53,866
[SPEAKER_01]: That awesome song that they took out in the movie.

1346
02:13:54,246 --> 02:13:56,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it does bring the movie down a little bit.

1347
02:13:56,707 --> 02:13:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so good.

1348
02:13:59,689 --> 02:14:00,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

1349
02:14:00,429 --> 02:14:06,652
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually digitally reinserted it back into the movie and it really does kill the inertia of the second half of the movie.

1350
02:14:06,672 --> 02:14:07,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand why they cut it.

1351
02:14:07,952 --> 02:14:14,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, there actually was a really bad game on the Commodore 64 and Apple II that was also Rocky Horror Show.

1352
02:14:14,655 --> 02:14:16,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So to see it coming back is actually pretty rad.

1353
02:14:16,756 --> 02:14:20,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sneak through just a little bit of the chiptune time warp because it's so good.

1354
02:14:26,513 --> 02:14:26,833
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1355
02:14:26,913 --> 02:14:27,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so good.

1356
02:14:27,693 --> 02:14:28,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

1357
02:14:28,134 --> 02:14:28,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1358
02:14:28,414 --> 02:14:30,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to hear the songs chiptuned.

1359
02:14:31,075 --> 02:14:40,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry, Loki, but you know I have... The company that's putting it out has been known for making kind of these obscure cult movie-based games.

1360
02:14:40,718 --> 02:14:44,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did Manos, the Hands of Fate, which was a 2D platformer as well.

1361
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:47,141
[SPEAKER_06]: They've also done the Angry Video Game.

1362
02:14:47,161 --> 02:14:47,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I need that.

1363
02:14:48,201 --> 02:14:51,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Adventure, and its sequel as well.

1364
02:14:52,205 --> 02:14:54,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it looks pretty good.

1365
02:14:55,007 --> 02:14:58,070
[SPEAKER_06]: It's similar to like a Castlevania or Mega Man style game.

1366
02:14:58,270 --> 02:14:59,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So looking forward to it.

1367
02:14:59,631 --> 02:15:02,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get this Manos Hands of Fate one right now.

1368
02:15:02,313 --> 02:15:04,095
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the best MST3K.

1369
02:15:05,356 --> 02:15:08,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the one episode where they apologized for making him watch the movie.

1370
02:15:10,908 --> 02:15:21,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have a game that is in development right now that's launched a Kickstarter campaign called This Is Fine, Maximum Cope.

1371
02:15:21,554 --> 02:15:26,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic meme with the dog sitting in the burning room.

1372
02:15:28,396 --> 02:15:50,610
[SPEAKER_06]: it looks silly and yeah that's supposed to be they're working on getting that put out they said that it's eventually launching targeting March 2026 and available on PlayStation 5 Nintendo Switch and Steam although by then who knows what platforms Nintendo Switch is that even going to be a thing in 2026 I don't know

1373
02:15:54,615 --> 02:15:59,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're trying to reach a goal of 50,000, which I think they probably will.

1374
02:16:00,964 --> 02:16:01,905
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, DarkSakura.

1375
02:16:03,888 --> 02:16:06,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I was mesmerized by Manos, the Hands of Fate.

1376
02:16:09,856 --> 02:16:10,918
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's not Deathbed.

1377
02:16:12,179 --> 02:16:25,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, for Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, or Garou Densetsu, the DLC characters coming up for that for Season Pass 1 is Ken and Chun-Li from Street Fighter.

1378
02:16:27,108 --> 02:16:31,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken is launching Summer of 2025 with Chun-Li coming in the winter.

1379
02:16:32,011 --> 02:16:33,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there you go.

1380
02:16:33,712 --> 02:16:37,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they fucking stop teasing us and just give us Capcom SNK 3?

1381
02:16:37,775 --> 02:16:38,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1382
02:16:38,355 --> 02:16:38,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

1383
02:16:38,695 --> 02:16:39,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

1384
02:16:39,115 --> 02:16:39,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

1385
02:16:39,976 --> 02:16:40,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, enough.

1386
02:16:40,516 --> 02:16:40,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

1387
02:16:41,437 --> 02:16:41,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

1388
02:16:43,407 --> 02:16:44,307
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, this is great news.

1389
02:16:44,347 --> 02:16:44,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to hear it.

1390
02:16:45,608 --> 02:16:45,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1391
02:16:48,249 --> 02:16:53,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, hey, if you are a fan of Tetris, I'm sure you've heard of Tetris the Grandmaster.

1392
02:16:53,492 --> 02:16:55,973
[SPEAKER_02]: To many, it's like the definitive version of Tetris.

1393
02:16:56,273 --> 02:16:57,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next to the NES.

1394
02:16:58,174 --> 02:17:04,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people consider the Nintendo... I want to say the NES original, but technically that was the... Many people consider the Nintendo-branded

1395
02:17:04,777 --> 02:17:05,838
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1396
02:17:24,209 --> 02:17:50,243
[SPEAKER_02]: but then guess what they announced yep it's Tetris the Grandmaster series coming in 2025 so we'll be in the first three months next year the game is designed to help train you into the ultimate Tetris Pro that's all they said no screenshots no nothing yet but come on bitches it's Tetris like you know what to expect and all you need to know is it's another in the Grandmaster series I'm sure that is enough to get you excited about that so please look forward to it early next year

1397

[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTutsuya in chat says, love me some Grandmaster.

[SPEAKER_02]: I have the two on Arcade Archives.

1399

[SPEAKER_02]: It's really my favorite spinoff.

1400
02:17:58,353 --> 02:18:00,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I keep forgetting it's on Arcade Archives.

1401
02:18:00,095 --> 02:18:01,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to pick it up myself.

1402
02:18:02,276 --> 02:18:04,178
[SPEAKER_02]: We love a good run of Tetris.

1403
02:18:04,658 --> 02:18:05,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fun.

1404
02:18:06,039 --> 02:18:10,443

02:22:19,151 --> 02:22:20,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But Kind Words 2 for PC and Mac.

1434
02:22:21,232 --> 02:22:22,213
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's it.

1435
02:22:23,554 --> 02:22:29,237
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we have just a few more stories for you and then we'll see if we get any quick questions or things for Listener Roundtable tonight.

1436
02:22:29,577 --> 02:22:31,759
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's go over to Loki.

1437
02:22:33,075 --> 02:22:33,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1438
02:22:34,856 --> 02:22:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Twitch is removing one of the most famous emotes that's on the platform right now, the Bible Thump, which is, of course, from the game The Binding of Isaac.

1439
02:22:48,641 --> 02:22:49,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it's un...

1440
02:22:51,142 --> 02:22:57,466
[SPEAKER_06]: They posted out on Twitter saying that, you know, the end of the Bible Thump era is nigh.

1441
02:22:58,406 --> 02:23:02,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says, on September 30th, our rights to our beloved emote expire.

1442
02:23:02,869 --> 02:23:06,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And while this is sad news, we know all emotes go to heaven.

1443
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:10,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of sad, we're going to need a new emote to spam these feelings.

1444
02:23:11,193 --> 02:23:11,593
[SPEAKER_06]: However...

1445
02:23:15,766 --> 02:23:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people point out, it's like, oh, it's terrible news.

1446
02:23:18,289 --> 02:23:22,014
[SPEAKER_06]: A small indie company can't afford licensing fees for a single emote.

1447
02:23:24,116 --> 02:23:25,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's funny is actually...

1448
02:23:27,401 --> 02:23:41,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from that, it says for those wondering what happened with the Bible Thumb emote, I'm 100% fine with coming up with a good solution to keep or modify the emote, but I'm not in control of the new Twitch policy, so it's really up to them.

1449
02:23:41,608 --> 02:23:48,011
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the lead developer who, of course, shipped Super Meat Boy and the game.

1450
02:23:48,031 --> 02:23:55,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It says he still owns the rights to the image and would be 100% fine with Twitch renewing them at seemingly little or no cost.

1451
02:23:56,796 --> 02:23:56,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But

1452
02:23:57,555 --> 02:24:26,103
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not going to pay anything I guess for it well I kind of came to the same conclusion that Bobby is apparently officially reporting in chat right now saying Twitch policy is to no longer pay for rights for emotes because they don't have enough money to do so anymore so they're going to let all of their licensed emotes expire they can't pay their staff they're having to cut costs and cut quarters with all that stuff so I'm kind of not surprised to hear that they're cutting the emote to be quite honest

1453
02:24:28,049 --> 02:24:29,930
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1454
02:24:50,771 --> 02:24:53,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that also in Rotterdam as well.

1455
02:24:54,533 --> 02:25:01,275
[SPEAKER_06]: You're telling me that they couldn't scrape up a few thousand dollars from those events?

1456
02:25:01,695 --> 02:25:03,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they needed a donation bin.

1457
02:25:03,256 --> 02:25:06,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Save the Bible Thumb emote.

1458
02:25:06,557 --> 02:25:10,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hard time believing that they can't scrape up that amount of money.

1459
02:25:12,259 --> 02:25:13,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch should do a marathon.

1460
02:25:14,636 --> 02:25:20,383
[SPEAKER_06]: They do all these exclusive parties and stuff like that for their partners and stuff.

1461
02:25:20,904 --> 02:25:24,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe throw one less party and then you can afford your meme...

1462
02:25:27,839 --> 02:25:29,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Emote, but whatever.

1463
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:31,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby has another comment in chat.

1464
02:25:31,441 --> 02:25:41,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's the very, like, it's the corporate line that makes sense on paper that says, I think it's more policy from on high to not pay anybody for emotes.

1465
02:25:41,508 --> 02:25:45,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet the Twitch rank and file would love to license it, but Big Daddy Amazon says no.

1466
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:46,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1467
02:25:46,431 --> 02:25:47,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the policy.

1468
02:25:48,012 --> 02:25:49,212
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the policy.

1469
02:25:50,233 --> 02:25:52,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can still sit here and say the policy sucks.

1470
02:25:52,775 --> 02:25:54,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

1471
02:25:56,332 --> 02:25:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that many people would subscribe.

1472
02:25:58,153 --> 02:25:58,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1473
02:26:19,784 --> 02:26:20,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1474
02:26:20,924 --> 02:26:21,264
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1475
02:26:22,005 --> 02:26:28,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, somebody I think many of you are subscribed to on YouTube, and you're probably sad to see her say, I'm done.

1476
02:26:29,267 --> 02:26:29,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm quitting.

1477
02:26:30,307 --> 02:26:31,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm retiring.

1478
02:26:31,667 --> 02:26:36,409
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Skyrim grandma, or Shirley Curry, is retiring.

1479
02:26:36,449 --> 02:26:36,929
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1480
02:26:37,429 --> 02:26:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: She started when she was just 79 years old, but now she is...

1481
02:26:45,885 --> 02:26:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1482
02:27:02,006 --> 02:27:10,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that I spent most of my time sitting here at this computer and lately, probably for the last month, I walk in here and look at my computer and think, I've got to make a video today.

1483
02:27:10,949 --> 02:27:13,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just shake my head at myself and say, I don't want to.

1484
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:15,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no desire to.

1485
02:27:16,251 --> 02:27:19,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old and I'm tired and I don't feel like doing much anymore.

1486
02:27:20,152 --> 02:27:21,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing it for fun.

1487
02:27:21,252 --> 02:27:21,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1488
02:27:21,632 --> 02:27:22,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not funny.

1489
02:27:22,293 --> 02:27:25,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, honestly, all her reasons are legit.

1490
02:27:25,814 --> 02:27:26,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

1491
02:27:28,767 --> 02:27:38,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that she wants to go live her life and there is a very distinct possibility that Elder Scrolls 6 may not come out in time, if you know what I mean.

1492
02:27:39,416 --> 02:27:42,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little morbid, but yeah.

1493
02:27:42,199 --> 02:27:42,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

1494
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:46,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But she can go out and enjoy her life and make the most of it.

1495
02:27:47,464 --> 02:27:49,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend some of that money you've been earning on YouTube.

1496
02:27:50,406 --> 02:27:51,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Take yourself on a nice cruise.

1497
02:27:52,428 --> 02:27:53,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun with it.

1498
02:27:53,849 --> 02:27:54,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what you want.

1499
02:27:55,919 --> 02:27:58,081
[SPEAKER_02]: She also has a surgery coming up, to be fair.

1500
02:27:58,181 --> 02:27:58,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what?

1501
02:27:59,482 --> 02:28:02,485
[SPEAKER_02]: She's given you all this content and all this stuff to listen to over the years.

1502
02:28:02,705 --> 02:28:03,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.

1503
02:28:04,367 --> 02:28:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100Matt says, I feel like that at 40.

1504
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:11,313
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100Matt also quips, she's bowing out of the race and endorsing Kamala.

1505
02:28:11,393 --> 02:28:15,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good for her, because there's really only two choices at this point.

1506
02:28:16,998 --> 02:28:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think I have to tell you that that would be the same decision I would make as well.

1507
02:28:22,165 --> 02:28:22,465
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1508
02:28:23,006 --> 02:28:28,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move to the listener roundtable where we invite you to participate with our show.

1509
02:28:28,592 --> 02:28:31,215
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some questions in our chat, we'd be happy to field them.

1510
02:28:31,235 --> 02:28:35,379
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running a little long tonight, so I don't know if we want to do a ton of calls, but maybe we can sneak in.

1511
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:36,020
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no email.

1512
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:36,921
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no email?

1513
02:28:37,381 --> 02:28:39,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all had two weeks and no emails?

1514
02:28:40,174 --> 02:28:40,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I am disappointed.

1515
02:28:41,534 --> 02:28:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate at OrangeSongsRadio.com especially if you have a picture where you're booping Dark Sakura in her pig cosplay.

1516
02:28:47,897 --> 02:28:55,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that picture sent to participate at OrangeSongsRadio.com because I need to see this.

1517
02:28:56,019 --> 02:28:56,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So please send that in.

1518
02:28:56,879 --> 02:28:58,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just say hello.

1519
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:01,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know your thoughts on the new Zelda game or what you're playing these days.

1520
02:29:02,241 --> 02:29:04,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're just discovering

1521
02:29:04,742 --> 02:29:05,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me why

1522
02:29:27,612 --> 02:29:29,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be stuck in my head again, Rob.

1523
02:29:29,853 --> 02:29:30,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1524
02:29:32,594 --> 02:29:52,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw, what was it, that the guy that was kind of responsible for dumping a lot of those arcade games, the Bomani stuff, like on Twitter and stuff, he's managed to modify the dump and modify the DDR mini machine to put other mixes.

1525
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:54,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I've heard is kind of a dumpster fire.

1526
02:29:54,321 --> 02:29:54,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1527
02:29:55,041 --> 02:29:56,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's really missing a lot of stuff.

1528
02:29:57,699 --> 02:30:23,162
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah well they it has it apparently it has all those songs still on there they just disabled them so it has like the music and stuff so the modders are oh oh my god the modders are already done re-enabling them because i think i think he's found a way to like well to essentially like to um to dump a new image on there too to unlock that stuff again so be interesting to see what happens with that

1529
02:30:23,982 --> 02:30:31,003
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting, OrangeRite says you can still play them, the machine just mutes them and puts a message on the screen what?

1530
02:30:31,404 --> 02:30:49,387
[SPEAKER_02]: that's even worse that's so funny anyway DarkSakura, just be glad you know what, I'm in my third mix and my fifth mix era, just be glad I didn't go to fourth mix yet, but maybe in the next week because DarkSakura, if I go to fourth mix 1, 2, 3 4, 0, 0, 7 no, no

1531
02:30:57,292 --> 02:31:24,194
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me do you know about the seven the seven tell me do you know about the seven I seriously at my funeral when you lower my casket play the seven jump just do it just do it as we drop your corpse into a fire just do it and then the seven boom

1532
02:31:26,038 --> 02:31:26,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump.

1533
02:31:26,458 --> 02:31:26,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump.

1534
02:31:26,778 --> 02:31:26,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump.

1535
02:31:27,038 --> 02:31:27,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump.

1536
02:31:27,158 --> 02:31:27,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Dump.

1537
02:31:28,139 --> 02:31:28,799
Dump.

1538
02:31:29,099 --> 02:31:29,239
Dump.

1539
02:31:29,299 --> 02:31:29,419
Dump.

1540
02:31:29,479 --> 02:31:29,599
Dump.

1541
02:31:29,799 --> 02:31:29,939
Dump.

1542
02:31:29,959 --> 02:31:30,520
Dump.

1543
02:31:56,808 --> 02:31:58,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand it.

1544
02:31:58,369 --> 02:31:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: That one, right?

1545
02:31:59,470 --> 02:32:01,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it had extra mix.

1546
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:08,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only had the fourth mix plus stuff, so like Cat's Eye and Conga Feelin' and all that shit, but then it had all the bass mix.

1547
02:32:09,213 --> 02:32:15,456
[SPEAKER_02]: The Baby Mama and the Hysteria and all the booty mix songs from the bass.

1548
02:32:15,476 --> 02:32:16,176
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's funny?

1549
02:32:16,516 --> 02:32:16,717
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1550
02:32:17,677 --> 02:32:20,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been going back and watching the episodes of Cat's Eye.

1551
02:32:21,127 --> 02:32:21,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, have you really?

1552
02:32:21,887 --> 02:32:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

1553
02:32:22,568 --> 02:32:24,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great anime.

1554
02:32:24,749 --> 02:32:28,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know at the time it's actually associated with the City Hunter universe.

1555
02:32:29,171 --> 02:32:29,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1556
02:32:30,552 --> 02:32:34,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the characters appear in like some of the City Hunter movies and stuff.

1557
02:32:34,774 --> 02:32:36,115
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually kind of interesting.

1558
02:32:36,735 --> 02:32:38,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it's a really good show.

1559
02:32:38,877 --> 02:32:43,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about like three lady thieves trying to steal back their own stuff.

1560
02:32:44,561 --> 02:32:47,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm screaming because Orange Rite is throwing it way back in chat.

1561
02:32:47,642 --> 02:32:55,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike Deft said, And then Orange Rite followed that up with, We had a bumper around that.

1562
02:32:55,845 --> 02:32:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch, get a new song.

1563
02:32:58,966 --> 02:32:59,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1564
02:32:59,766 --> 02:33:02,347
[SPEAKER_02]: He's throwing it back to that old bumper.

1565
02:33:05,728 --> 02:33:07,689
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to remake those bumpers.

1566
02:33:07,809 --> 02:33:08,269
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't.

1567
02:33:09,109 --> 02:33:09,670
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we do.

1568
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:10,830
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we do.

1569
02:33:13,823 --> 02:33:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, my ex-boyfriend was the voice in a lot of those bumpers.

1570
02:33:19,705 --> 02:33:20,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing it way back.

1571
02:33:20,985 --> 02:33:22,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard from him in years.

1572
02:33:22,426 --> 02:33:29,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know where... I tried looking for... Remember the days of putting in your voice and then lowering the pitch to sound different?

1573
02:33:29,168 --> 02:33:30,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1574
02:33:30,449 --> 02:33:32,929
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a thing that happened for a long time.

1575
02:33:32,989 --> 02:33:36,511
[SPEAKER_01]: That's... I shudder.

1576
02:33:36,951 --> 02:33:37,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I shudder.

1577
02:33:38,763 --> 02:33:40,324
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so many better times now.

1578
02:33:40,504 --> 02:33:41,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't apologize for it.

1579
02:33:41,785 --> 02:33:45,007
[SPEAKER_02]: We did what we had to do at the time for dial-up friendly radio.

1580
02:33:45,548 --> 02:33:46,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

1581
02:33:47,169 --> 02:33:47,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1582
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:50,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, enough reminiscing down memory lane.

1583
02:33:51,312 --> 02:33:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check with Loki if there's any current last-minute stories to talk about tonight.

1584
02:33:56,436 --> 02:33:57,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have anything.

1585
02:33:57,456 --> 02:34:02,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we covered out all the big stuff, so that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio tonight.

1586
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:06,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, as always, for listening to our show, whether this was your first show or your

1587
02:34:07,401 --> 02:34:10,324
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you're off to stream tonight, yes?

1588
02:34:33,763 --> 02:34:37,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and apparently Instacart didn't deliver my sodas.

1589
02:34:37,727 --> 02:34:38,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to go yell.

1590
02:34:39,449 --> 02:34:40,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had the Oreo soda?

1591
02:34:41,251 --> 02:34:41,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

1592
02:34:42,032 --> 02:34:43,594
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I had ordered more of.

1593
02:34:43,694 --> 02:34:44,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't find it.

1594
02:34:44,555 --> 02:34:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it once.

1595
02:34:45,616 --> 02:34:46,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking delicious.

1596
02:34:46,337 --> 02:34:47,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to Walmart.

1597
02:34:47,518 --> 02:34:48,499
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I went to Walmart.

1598
02:34:48,519 --> 02:34:49,140
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have it.

1599
02:34:50,242 --> 02:34:53,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to figure out what the fuck is going on with Instacart.

1600
02:34:53,303 --> 02:34:55,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I set foot at a Walmart, Jamie.

1601
02:34:55,584 --> 02:34:59,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate going to Walmart and I set foot in a Walmart to try to find Oreo Coke.

1602
02:35:00,486 --> 02:35:01,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I found?

1603
02:35:01,487 --> 02:35:02,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Coke flavored Oreos.

1604
02:35:02,527 --> 02:35:03,368
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I didn't find?

1605
02:35:03,468 --> 02:35:04,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreo flavored Coke.

1606
02:35:06,646 --> 02:35:07,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

1607
02:35:07,407 --> 02:35:08,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Missing items.

1608
02:35:08,948 --> 02:35:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreo Coke isn't necessarily that great, but... I ordered my soda.

1609
02:35:13,590 --> 02:35:15,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't my soda showing on the damn thing?

1610
02:35:15,872 --> 02:35:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

1611
02:35:17,313 --> 02:35:23,036
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is just vanilla Coke with an extra little kick, and that's all I need.

1612
02:35:23,076 --> 02:35:27,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really good, and I'm really pissed that they didn't deliver... The fact that it's in a zero flavor is perfect.

1613
02:35:27,879 --> 02:35:28,319
[SPEAKER_02]: My God.

1614
02:35:28,539 --> 02:35:28,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1615
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:31,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to know what happened to my damn order now.

1616
02:35:31,881 --> 02:35:32,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them.

1617
02:35:32,241 --> 02:35:32,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pissed.

1618
02:35:32,922 --> 02:35:33,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them.

1619
02:35:33,582 --> 02:35:33,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1620
02:35:34,583 --> 02:35:34,823
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1621
02:35:36,119 --> 02:35:39,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yes, sorry, PodCulture, it is Oreo Coke Zero.

1622
02:35:39,043 --> 02:35:39,564
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I drink.

1623
02:35:39,644 --> 02:35:44,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, ever since the Dabudis, that's all I drink now is Zero and Diet and all that stuff, so.

1624
02:35:45,391 --> 02:35:52,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't drink, that's not what I drink, because I always say that, and without fail, somebody will come in and say, you know, diet drinks are bad for you.

1625
02:35:53,161 --> 02:35:53,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't

1626
02:35:54,523 --> 02:35:56,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't inject them into my veins.

1627
02:35:56,564 --> 02:35:58,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it all day, every day.

1628
02:35:58,445 --> 02:36:00,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go through a two liter every day.

1629
02:36:00,626 --> 02:36:02,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy the occasional soda with dinner.

1630
02:36:03,267 --> 02:36:04,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's acceptable.

1631
02:36:04,688 --> 02:36:05,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1632
02:36:05,649 --> 02:36:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1633
02:36:05,969 --> 02:36:08,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find them, but I didn't get my stuff.

1634
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're a fever dream.

1635
02:36:09,591 --> 02:36:10,591
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't exist anymore.

1636
02:36:12,972 --> 02:36:14,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I drank the shit out of them.

1637
02:36:15,714 --> 02:36:16,014
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1638
02:36:17,274 --> 02:36:18,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you streaming tonight?

1639
02:36:19,973 --> 02:36:21,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you are doing DBD.

1640
02:36:21,394 --> 02:36:23,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure if you were doing Palia or something else tonight.

1641
02:36:23,334 --> 02:36:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, DBD tonight.

1642
02:36:24,675 --> 02:36:26,415
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big blood hunt going on anyway, isn't there?

1643
02:36:26,695 --> 02:36:27,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is.

1644
02:36:27,396 --> 02:36:28,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Chaos Shuffle.

1645
02:36:28,236 --> 02:36:29,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Chaos Shuffle is always fun.

1646
02:36:29,576 --> 02:36:31,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So, check that out.

1647
02:36:32,077 --> 02:36:34,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just really, really irritated.

1648
02:36:34,298 --> 02:36:37,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, do you want to spread some of that irritation in your final thought tonight?

1649
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:39,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hell yeah.

1650
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:42,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna let them have it.

1651
02:36:42,641 --> 02:36:43,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them have it.

1652
02:36:44,422 --> 02:36:45,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good stream, DarkSakura.

1653
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:47,001
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

1654
02:36:47,081 --> 02:36:47,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1655
02:36:48,122 --> 02:36:49,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, but not a stream.

1656
02:36:49,042 --> 02:36:49,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not streaming.

1657
02:36:49,623 --> 02:36:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll stream tomorrow.

1658
02:36:50,604 --> 02:36:51,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a good stream tomorrow.

1659
02:36:52,785 --> 02:36:53,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1660
02:36:53,246 --> 02:36:53,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1661
02:36:54,027 --> 02:36:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1662
02:36:55,188 --> 02:36:58,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, then that takes us to you and your final thought tonight.

1663
02:36:59,091 --> 02:37:01,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought is I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

1664
02:37:03,012 --> 02:37:03,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, mood.

1665
02:37:03,592 --> 02:37:04,893
[SPEAKER_02]: This weekend wasn't long enough.

1666
02:37:05,013 --> 02:37:07,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I enjoy my job and all, but it's just one of those, like, ah.

1667
02:37:08,655 --> 02:37:14,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had a fucking vacation last weekend, and I'm already, like, I just want to sleep for, like, a whole day.

1668
02:37:14,698 --> 02:37:15,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a day in bed.

1669
02:37:15,598 --> 02:37:16,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a horizontal day.

1670
02:37:16,979 --> 02:37:17,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

1671
02:37:18,420 --> 02:37:18,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1672
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:23,122
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is, yeah, thank you, modders.

1673
02:37:23,623 --> 02:37:27,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, modders, for everything you've done for the community, and you've done an awful lot.

1674
02:37:27,385 --> 02:37:31,667
[SPEAKER_02]: We salute you here on September 29th, officially Modders Day.

1675
02:37:32,771 --> 02:37:33,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I do declare.

1676
02:37:34,772 --> 02:37:36,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for saving our industry.

1677
02:37:36,432 --> 02:37:37,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good week, everybody.

1678
02:37:37,673 --> 02:37:38,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time in seven days.

1679
02:37:38,973 --> 02:37:40,053
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it all over again.

1680
02:37:40,534 --> 02:37:41,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

1681
02:38:02,083 --> 02:38:04,046
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know they were all still true.

1682
02:38:04,126 --> 02:38:04,767
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week.
