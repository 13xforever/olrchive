39534	42437	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
42497	47602	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47742	58613	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 1018 of our program after a week off last week.
59133	59634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
75311	76712	I am fighting Guinness right now.
77353	79915	Oh, is this about the world record acknowledgement thing?
80295	83678	Yeah, the application that I submitted is like gone.
85760	94888	I got my copy of the book though, which is... Yeah, so I found one though that's like longest running weekly podcast with the same host.
96009	96349	Interesting.
96529	100552	Oh, like all in all podcasts, like ever.
100692	101933	Like not just gaming, but all?
101954	102034	Yeah.
102921	103201	Is it?
104202	106945	I think it's still that other one though.
106985	107846	But we're fully weekly.
108146	113672	I think, yeah, I, yeah, it would either be the, well, I guess it would either count the other one if it was gaming.
113712	115093	We talked about that, you know, two weeks ago.
115254	120579	Or I want to say some, I want to say the comic podcast, are Donna Drew still around?
120859	123342	Like that, like there's some old comedy podcasts.
123362	126025	I'm going to need to find out what happened to that application.
126045	126125	Yeah.
126565	126905	Find it.
126925	127806	They put it in the bin.
128347	128627	All right.
128647	130189	You better not have.
130829	133071	Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
134646	135167	Hi, Loki.
135747	137609	What's this game playing behind you tonight?
137629	146898	Because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
146978	150181	And see, having a live chat room here on Twitch, we can get corrected live.
150261	152963	PodCulture says that Don and Drew faded a while back.
153744	160010	There's got to be a couple tech shows and things that are not necessarily gaming related that are still kicking all these years later, I'm sure.
160510	161050	Some of that stuff.
161070	163551	But anyway, Loki, what is this game playing behind you?
163571	166173	Because that owl in the background looked like the Tootsie Roll owl.
168253	169434	It's Plucky Squire.
169734	170794	Oh, Plucky Squire.
171095	175917	Oh, this is like on my list of games I want to get around to playing because the art style in this looked really cool.
175977	177197	Have you had a chance to play this yet?
177797	178218	I have not.
178438	178818	Oh, bummer.
179018	179818	I got to check this out.
179918	180639	It looks really cool.
181633	183013	DarkSakura, Loki, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
204261	205121	I love Seattle.
205402	206662	I can get cheap plane tickets.
206962	209283	Let's go play Ingress and I'll see some of my friends up here.
209303	210164	And so I did all of that.
210584	213425	And it was really fun, but it doesn't really relate to the gaming industry.
213565	215286	So that was my weekend.
215386	222429	But I want to talk a little more to DarkSakura and Loki because you both were at TwitchCon in San Diego.
223169	224910	And how was it?
226954	228235	It was painful.
229055	232996	I mean, for me, I had some very wicked shoes.
233577	234237	It was a lot of fun.
234637	234897	Yeah.
236138	237358	Yeah, it was really fun.
237918	239819	DarkSakura, this has got to be at least your what?
239859	241400	Is this like your fourth TwitchCon?
241420	241760	My third.
241920	242360	Your third.
243100	244421	How did this year compare to the other two?
245920	264419	um it was about the same I mean it was much better than Las Vegas I'll put it that way but I didn't do as much of the like hardcore networking that I do before and just was I wanted to have a good time this time and check out like news and I didn't really get to go to any of the panels I wanted to but um uh
265487	274674	I went to the meetup brunch that our big Dead by Daylight and whatnot group does.
275635	285902	And funny enough, I was sitting there and I was chatting with Bourbon, who is our friend, DBD, and a variety streamer.
285922	287463	He's a good guy.
287623	288384	I lurk in his channel.
288404	290085	I don't think he knows who I am, but I lurk in his channel.
290125	290485	He's a good guy.
290506	290606	Yeah.
291670	304299	and he had this whole like set up to like do a green screen and take a picture and make it an avatar and blah blah blah and I don't know how it came up I was like yeah I should just have like a sign that says we'll squeak for boops because I was cosplaying pig
305575	308798	and like, well, here's some paper and some Crayola markers.
308918	309519	Have at it.
310640	318948	And so I made the sign and I was walking around with Will Boop for Squeaks and had a pig face with a little finger pointing at the nose.
319729	324253	And I got many boops and oddly enough, like a bunch of photo ops that way.
324473	327917	Okay, for a Dead by Daylight crowd, that's a really clever idea, actually.
329058	345940	there was a DBD meetup as well yeah because that's a that's a big meme in the game if you know if you've ever watched Dead by Daylight streamers booping a pig which is doing that because there's literally every character for some reason has an emo it's like pointing it's pointing but if you do it really close to pig it looks like you're booping your snoot and everybody loves if you're if you're both kneeling yeah yeah
346721	370269	and we even did like some kneeling poses so uh i got my my lunge exercises in for the day um and uh i uh i had to like shed costume to play para para paradise because yes there was a para para and i played the same three songs over and over that i still remember okay um there were a couple other people there the second day that knew the dances so that was fun that's cool
371884	373945	I tried to do Anniversary for you and then I forgot it.
374765	375205	That's okay.
375305	377986	The only one I could maybe do Boom Boom Fire.
378447	379887	Boom Boom Fire, Boom Boom Fire.
379907	381548	I did Deluxe.
381628	383528	I just kind of remember it.
384629	388250	I did Deluxe and Night of Fire and Eurobeat.
389662	409461	Eurobeat's an easy one you could just like watch it and pick it pick that one back up but I'm sorry Night of Fire is like the most fun one to do just because it's very active and posey at the same time well it's it's funny that there were people there the second day that knew the dances because I don't know if you know even though this show and I'm sure most people know at this point but if you didn't
410121	410762	Orange Launch Radio.
410822	416466	We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution and Konami's Bomani series and all that back in the day at the arcades.
416846	427434	And so we used to talk pretty much exclusively about that until that era when Konami really kind of let that go for a long time and then Guitar Hero ended up being on the scene and we ended up kind of expanding to all types of games.
427794	445641	But I bring that up because now there's all these, I don't know if you know, but there's like new shows and new podcasts and Twitch personalities that are all about Bomani games and all of this because of the renaissance that round one has sort of lended itself to with, you know, Konami series and Konami is kind of investing in this arcades again.
446141	454004	So it wouldn't surprise me, Jamie, if these people that came up that knew the dances were like part of this like new crowd and not realizing that you are their Aunt Jamie.
455995	463220	No, there were like a couple of younger people, but mostly, I mean, I think that they were playing Parapara back in the day, too.
463560	465942	Petition to change DarkSakura to AntSakura.
467203	471426	Well, I mean, I am the drunk auntie of Twitch, so whatever.
471446	472086	No, I love that.
472146	472607	I love that.
474568	476550	Loki, this was your very first TwitchCon.
478331	481473	How were you overwhelmed, or how was it for you?
483154	487656	No, I wasn't necessarily overwhelmed because there wasn't a whole lot that I had scheduled.
487756	493698	I mean, I did have a pretty packed schedule, but it was all kind of front-loaded within the first couple days.
494018	499360	And then beyond that, it was just kind of like, I don't know, I'll go to some panels if I feel like it.
499741	504422	I ended up not really going to a lot of panels outside of the Minecraft stuff.
505983	510625	I had kind of marked off some things that I was going to go check out, but I just didn't end up doing it.
512592	513994	But it was packed.
515135	524765	Yeah, I peaked your Twitter because, and you know that's a compliment because I don't like to go on that site, but I was curious, like, did Loki post some pictures on TwitchCon?
524805	525966	I saw you got... I did not.
526246	530611	No, but you had like a lot of selfies or like meet and greet type photos.
530651	531131	Yeah, yeah.
531271	531452	Yeah.
532052	537997	So, okay, so I'll try to quickly go across what I did at TwitchCon, you know, the days.
538417	540899	So, started the day before TwitchCon.
541600	550206	So, essentially, everybody that was going to TwitchCon in, like, the MCC Rising stuff, Avondale, who actually runs...
551547	569874	MCC Rising and he does a bunch of other stuff for Nox Crew had asked like they did in Rotterdam if you want premium seating fill out this form and we'll get you on a list and stuff like that for the event so I filled that out but then one of the questions was
571061	573744	Are you available from noon to six on Thursday?
574464	575766	It didn't say what it was.
575846	578428	It just said, are you available from noon to six on Thursday?
578468	583574	I'm like, between noon and six or for, you know, for six hours on Thursday.
585335	587557	And they just wouldn't say what it was.
587858	589079	And so I was curious.
589119	590540	So I ended up moving my flight.
591161	592522	to make that time.
593682	595383	So I got there like at 10 in the morning.
596123	602085	But then the day before, they let us know that we were playtesting MCC Twitch Rivals.
602306	606847	So essentially, we got there at noon.
606967	615211	Then everything kind of got delayed a couple hours because there was a Sanjay slam or whatever that was before it.
616292	630485	um they were doing testing the producing entertainment always runs behind a couple hours yeah the the street fighter tournament thing they were running behind their testing stuff so we got postponed by two and a half hours this is why you needed six hours reserved
631278	650924	right pretty much yeah yeah so so we went there and um yeah so we got the full experience of being a being like a contestant in twitch rivals we played on the it's not really a stage i guess it's like sort of a stage in on the actual pcs and everything that the contestants are going to be playing on so you
650984	652565	Survivor Dream Team Survivor Dream Team
673192	673612	Pretty much.
673833	676594	Yeah, so there's some stuff that they had to work out.
676895	689003	But it was also, since it is the full experience, and they are practicing the production part of that as well, there's cameramen up in your face with production studio cameras and everything, and like the boom camera and all that stuff.
689223	690924	It's a really weird experience.
690984	695107	Yeah, you have to make sure you pluck those gray eyebrows that I was complaining before the show, everybody.
695147	700650	I had a gray eye, one singular gray little hair that was driving me bonkers.
700771	702892	And yes, I plucked it in the two minutes before the show tonight.
703152	704613	Yeah, so we got to do all that.
704653	711538	We had a team with some of the other rising folks, and this guy, WoogieX, who was a friend of a rising person, who ended up playing on our team.
711598	713479	Our team ended up winning, which is awesome.
713499	717301	We got to win an MCC that doesn't really count, and nobody really can know about it.
717582	723085	I'm not really supposed to share this on social media, but who watches this show after 20 years?
723125	725847	But anyways, so we did all that.
725867	727428	Print that in your book of world records.
728789	730210	Yeah, world record, yeah.
730270	730470	Anyway,
732091	732632	So we did all that.
732652	733832	It was extremely exciting.
733913	734813	Just a really good time.
736234	743080	Because we had waited so long, Avondale had given us one of the MCC coins as well that you could purchase for Season 3.
743440	746622	So we got one of those.
747403	752807	So the next day, first day of TwitchCon, we had meet and greets with Hermitcraft folks.
753788	757311	Well, actually, I think at first it was the storytelling in Minecraft.
757751	758512	So we did all that.
758652	759212	And then...
760797	761418	That was R.A.
761458	765921	I didn't really know the people that were doing that, but meet and greets with the Hermitcraft folks.
766001	774729	So I was able to meet, I met Cubfan135, who is our coach in MCC, and he was really awesome.
774789	777311	Like, I've been kind of chatting back and forth with him, and
778952	780173	I've been just very thankful.
780193	785336	He's been really good at promoting our SMP and just so inviting.
785776	789238	So when I got up to him, I'm like, oh, he's like, oh, who are you?
789379	790299	I'm like, I'm Loki.
790339	792761	He's like, oh, Loki, Loki, oh, come in here.
792781	794722	He gave me a hug and stuff like that.
794762	795963	Just a super cool guy.
796923	804228	And then I finally got to meet the hermit that I played with in my first SMP, TangoTex.
804248	807110	I got to meet him in person and thank him for all the
808999	835775	Inspiration that he's provided and everything I didn't get to meet a lot of people because at that point it started getting a little chaotic and the line wasn't moving as fast as they wanted it to so they were kind of rushing people through so I only got to see him for like a second and I didn't get to really meet anybody else but then later that night was a thing that I got invited to as part of the MCC stuff as well so it was the MCC Lunar Client Party so it was a private party
836235	838036	Jimmy Buffett's Dollar Tree
860902	875359	yeah yeah uh anyways whatever it doesn't matter the location they had uh you know they catered uh was it uh pasta and tacos and other stuff there's a reason why Denny's at two in the morning was still fun back in the day even though it was Denny's
876223	889176	Yeah, and then, so, I didn't really know a lot of people, obviously, at the MCC event, or the party, because there's a lot of people that do play MCC that are, like, really kind of the event hogs.
889456	893940	They know, like, all the people that play, so they were a lot more familiar with everybody.
894100	894320	I wasn't.
894341	896943	Well, Loki, for next year, Jamie's got the right idea.
897063	900947	Wear a costume that everybody's going to want to take a picture with, and now you're meeting everybody.
901533	901973	There you go.
902013	903094	Yeah, yeah.
903354	905256	But I did end up hanging out with Cubfan.
905296	913281	He was one of the two hermits that showed up because I guess the hermits are really tired, which I can imagine after meeting fans for two hours and 45 minutes.
913781	919966	So, you know, I got to hang out with him for like two hours and actually just like talk with him the entire time.
920006	921727	So that was great.
922587	924268	And then also...
925805	927545	Sorry, can I tangent for a minute?
927645	930626	Because 5th Dream in chat said, the goth hangout.
931026	939789	And obviously 5th Dream is talking about the Denny's at 2am reference, but for some reason when my brain first read that, I was like, is he talking about Margaritaville?
940309	942089	Being like, the goth hangout?
942469	947351	Was Jimmy Buffett secretly a backup singer for The Cure?
947711	948111	Like, what?
951405	980761	anyway, please excuse me I got to talk to him and met like Scott Smager who also runs MCC, met Noxite who is co-owner of or I think he is the owner of the Nox crew and just some other people as well another celebrity guy in the space TommyInIt and SmallishBeans who is Joel who is on the Hermitcraft he's one of the new Hermits this year
981693	990204	and so yeah it was really cool to get to meet all them and just talk to Cub for like a while and he was just very inviting just made sure I was like comfortable in the whole event and everything.
990725	993008	Sounds like the Minecraft community really turned out for this.
993939	994540	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
994660	995240	Yeah, for sure.
995541	998624	And then Saturday was the day of the event.
998864	1002327	So we got our premium seating, which is like front row.
1002788	1010295	I'm in like if you watch the the VODs of the event from TwitchCon, you can see me just constantly.
1010355	1011396	I'm just in the front row.
1011456	1013679	Like it's very obvious I'm wearing my jersey.
1014099	1015179	for the Orange Ocelots.
1015820	1018581	And yeah, it was like an incredible time.
1019161	1021002	I got swag from that.
1021102	1024743	I got so they announced a card game that they're going to be doing, a collectible card game.
1024783	1027944	I got an exclusive card, actually two of the exclusive cards.
1028044	1030125	Couldn't have worn a VOG Network shirt that day, huh?
1030646	1032526	Just kidding.
1032606	1035247	I know MCC, you know, brings you a lot of pride.
1035267	1035768	I understand.
1035808	1036228	I understand.
1036988	1041910	And then right after that, they had the Hermitcraft panel.
1043027	1050389	So they were talking about 10 years of, you know, making content on Hermitcraft and all that stuff and kind of just going through all that.
1050749	1056470	And then afterwards, they decided that they were going to do an impromptu meet and greet for everybody that showed up.
1056590	1059511	So I finally got to meet a few other creators.
1059591	1063052	I met Impulse, who does a podcast as well.
1063072	1068633	They do the Imp and Skizz podcast, which is kind of with the Hermitcraft folks and Good Times at Scar.
1069233	1079693	who is a really incredible builder so I got to meet him and I was able to say bye to Tango and Cub as well and just thank them for everything those guys should be waiting to meet you
1080882	1087826	I don't know what the secret to going viral on YouTube is because I think we all would have done it a long time ago, but you deserve it.
1087866	1090027	One of these days, they're going to all be there to meet you.
1103820	1132129	well they said you know they're like yeah we'll come back again and do this again in 10 years and I'm like I'm like well I'm gonna be on stage with you in 10 years so we'll see um and then uh was it uh so Saturday uh finally at that point I have not run into Jamie yet so I finally made up with Jamie and we we hung out pretty much the rest of uh TwitchCon to be fair that happens when Jamie and I both go to TwitchCon too I think one year we didn't see each other till the second day so
1135751	1150000	we met up to go to the Twitch block party but we got stopped by the hype train so I had to wait like 30 minutes for that thing to pull out and then, yeah, the block party was alright
1150726	1164075	they had some good food and stuff but it was alright it was kind of weird though because they had a couple stages so there was like the techno electronica stage and then bad karaoke that were just like combining with each other really bad
1165014	1188896	yeah it is it was not great uh so we kind of cut that short a bit and then was it Sunday I had a meet and greet with Smajor because he was kind of out of it uh the party that so I didn't really get to talk to him I think that a lot of the UK folks that were flying in were just really jet lagged so um I met him and thanked him for everything that he's done for like MCC and just in
1189296	1213918	keep including us and all that and uh so that's fun and then yeah we played uh music games and stuff got to play Dance Rush and stuff like that wow it sounds like they had quite a little music arcade they had quite the arcade yeah yeah Dance Rush uh they had a DDR machine that had uh it was a multi-loader in it because uh one day I saw it had Extreme we played it when it had Disney's Rave um
1214813	1217316	There was, yeah, all sorts of Bomani games there.
1217356	1222001	Just, like, everything from 2DX, DDR, In the Groove, Pump It Up.
1222501	1224424	Just, like, so many music games.
1226085	1226406	It was great.
1226426	1227587	So, Loki, what do you think?
1227827	1229930	The kids are only going to get older and more independent.
1229970	1231271	Do you think you might make it back next year?
1232873	1233514	We'll see.
1233534	1234314	Yeah, I...
1235731	1239092	Yeah, I was very tired after all of that.
1239613	1243994	I unfortunately came down with norovirus on the flight or the day home.
1244454	1245435	Yeah, something like that.
1245455	1247456	You really were on Margaritaville.
1247496	1253718	And so, yeah, so I was very sick to my stomach and just all of that, you know, trying to fly back.
1254318	1259220	And then it took, I just now been able to eat regular food today.
1259300	1261681	So it's taken a while to get past all that.
1262241	1263522	But you're skinny.
1265498	1268339	Not really, but it was worth it.
1268540	1269020	It was fun.
1269040	1272842	I'm trying to get some other people to go as well.
1275723	1280525	One of our members of the Channel 64 SMP, people are thinking about going next year.
1280966	1284427	So that would be cool to have someone else to hang out with as well.
1284507	1285968	So we'll see.
1286168	1286588	I don't know.
1286608	1286969	It's pretty good.
1287009	1287829	I'll go back next year.
1288609	1289370	Yeah, we'll see.
1289390	1291711	They've already said it's still in San Diego, and I'm like, great.
1292551	1315277	I would not probably go to the hotel I was at, that hotel made no sense and it's still pretty far away I would want to see if I could get something a little bit less expensive and maybe closer to the convention because it was still quite a ways, even though it was just within walking distance it was just 8 blocks back and forth, so I don't know
1316278	1320484	Before we get into headlines tonight, I actually want to go back to Jamie talking about TwitchCon a little bit.
1320524	1327074	I was going to ask you what your damage was in the art dealer hall this year.
1327174	1330018	I made it out pretty decently, I will be honest.
1332339	1333940	This application is so stupid.
1334260	1334480	Sorry.
1334640	1349385	Well, no, let me ask you about, because we didn't talk about, Loki didn't really talk about the vendors in the main hall, and there's always the exhibits in the main hall, and DarkSakura, I know you're pretty good about, you'll just walk up and chat to people that are running booths and stuff.
1349425	1353506	I'm kind of curious if you saw anything that kind of caught your eye in the main exhibit hall.
1354386	1356267	There were some really good artists.
1356667	1357587	Yeah.
1360238	1366868	I bought a very... Why can't I think of his name?
1367489	1367710	Like...
1368638	1372019	Mooka, Alphonse Mooka inspired Garrus print.
1373059	1377060	And I got a pretty hot kind of bloody Astarion.
1378540	1381561	Bought dice, mystery dice.
1382541	1385322	And down, well, there was also vendors downstairs.
1385602	1389203	One of them, I rolled, in fact, I've got the candle in front of me.
1389223	1395324	I bought a candle called A Dicey Surprise by Sweet As Scents Candle Company.
1396404	1401906	And this one is a lemon, like a lemony candle.
1401926	1402406	It smells really good.
1402847	1406368	Anyway, I rolled a D20 and rolled a 20.
1407368	1409709	So I got a 20% off discount.
1410670	1411370	That was pretty fun.
1413043	1417285	There were people doing, you know, like clothes, nerdy clothes.
1417425	1422447	And I got my Eat Cheese and Sin sticker, which made me very happy.
1423227	1424928	You know, just a couple of things all around.
1424948	1431611	But there were also, there was one called, oh gosh, was it Melanin Minerals?
1432771	1435112	That I picked up a couple of bath bombs the last day.
1435852	1441755	CBD infused bath bombs that honestly, when mixed with my Epsom salts, made for a very nice bath.
1443875	1468343	and I needed it because I did Disneyland after the con oh my god I can't imagine I'm stubborn anyway and the block party you should have seen my shoes although last year we did Disneyland first and then TwitchCon and it was pretty rough that's probably why I didn't go back this year to be honest you should have seen my shoes Rob for the party I had regrets I should have worn my toe pads for ballet
1471926	1475308	I would have loved to do karaoke on the big stage though.
1475328	1476209	I have the perfect song.
1476749	1477589	It's been so good.
1481091	1483653	There were people that I really wish would have learned how to pick a key.
1486415	1488477	I'm putting in all this information it wants to erase.
1488537	1489237	It's so stupid.
1489377	1489617	Anyway.
1489777	1494180	The song I would do, to be clear, is I'm the Scatman by Scatman John.
1494321	1496602	Would absolutely have to be the song you need to do.
1496622	1505448	I was going to say, I forgot to mention, we hung out a little bit with GDQX as well, so that was kind of fun.
1505888	1506349	That's cool.
1506409	1507930	In fact, we got my shirt.
1508790	1509731	Yep, I got mine too.
1509831	1510932	Oh, how about that?
1511618	1516880	We got the limited edition Peloton-sponsored shirts.
1517480	1517960	Oh, yeah.
1517980	1520361	I saw something of a Peloton-sponsoring GDQX.
1520401	1523962	Keep in mind, I was out of town the whole weekend, so I didn't get to see any of it, but interesting.
1524742	1524942	Huh.
1525742	1526123	Pretty cool.
1526223	1528123	Yeah.
1528963	1530704	But there was, I mean...
1532600	1536462	There were some interesting costumes as well.
1536562	1543267	I mean, like I said, there was a DBD meet and there was a Jake I met.
1544207	1545628	I mean, Jake cosplay is pretty easy.
1546501	1563989	yeah and then um it was you know but he looks the part he really looks he really looks the part and then there was a sort of a Huntress it was really uh kind of I guess Huntress themed and people kept giving me bracelets and stickers I now have a pixel pig sticker I love it
1564827	1569310	I need to go look through all of this to find who these artists were, but they were all amazing.
1570831	1575915	Just had a really, really good time, and then on Sunday I was like, no cosplay!
1577596	1579117	I asked Loki if he's going back next year.
1579137	1580018	Are you going to go back next year?
1580899	1581219	Duh.
1581979	1585042	I figured you were probably already sold on it, but I had to ask.
1586243	1587163	Yeah, I'm definitely going.
1589225	1593568	I'm going to probably buy better insoles for those boots, because you know I got a
1594560	1621882	I gotta bring a pig and I got to I'm actually thinking of doing Chibi Huntress or revamping my Julie cosplay well you got a year to figure it out time starts now yes I'm doing all Dead by Daylight cosplay we'll see what happens oh and one thing because I'm allergic to latex so I couldn't wear a big pig mask so I brought my little pig mask and people liked it I guess
1623820	1624100	All right.
1624400	1630162	Well, we will, I'm sure, talk more about TwitchCon as things remind us of that throughout the night.
1630322	1637483	But we're going to move on with the stories because actually, unlike a lot of weeks here recently on the show where it's kind of like, oh, there's not a lot going on this week.
1637603	1640684	Actually, a lot happened this week, and it's probably thanks to Tokyo Game Show.
1641124	1647106	But there's been a lot of stuff kind of happening about the industry and not directly in the industry either.
1647406	1652507	Loki, you want to tell us about this new law that could change some things in the gaming industry?
1653328	1667473	Yeah, so in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law, AB 2426, to combat disappearing purchases of digital games, movies, and music and e-books.
1668934	1677316	They say it'll force digital storefronts to tell customers that they're just getting a license to use the digital media rather than suggesting that you own it.
1680592	1691452	and it will ban storefronts from using the terms buy or purchase unless they inform consumers that they're not getting unrestricted access
1692661	1694063	to whatever they're buying.
1695724	1698727	I don't know if this necessarily is going to make much of a difference.
1699828	1709818	I saw a pretty good comparison to essentially like those warning labels that you see on a lot of products where it contains lead or something like that.
1710018	1715864	It's just they're going to have that label up there, but at the end of the day, is anyone really going to pay attention to it?
1717208	1720490	Yeah, I highly doubt this changes anything at the end of the day.
1721211	1727935	I'm more curious about what wordsmithing the lawyers are going to come up with to get around this, basically.
1727995	1730757	Like, what's the fuzzy language you're going to see on PlayStation Store now?
1730797	1733578	Because this isn't just going to affect California.
1733658	1736000	California may have passed the law, but let's be real.
1736080	1737781	PlayStation is going to have to make the change.
1737821	1743665	And when we say that, Nintendo, everybody else is going to have to make the change on their storefronts, and it's going to impact everybody.
1744485	1746986	and I'm kind of curious how they're going to get around the word buy.
1747126	1749846	And I think they're going to do something like play now.
1750566	1751446	Access now.
1751886	1753827	Add to library.
1754007	1755007	Jump in and play.
1755227	1756067	Add to library.
1756107	1758407	I think that's going to be a huge one.
1758547	1760648	Add to gaming library now.
1761388	1772270	Again, the lawyers will dig into exactly what they can and can't say but I think they're just going to dance around it in the wording front and not a lot is really going to change.
1772310	1772550	I mean, I...
1773630	1784629	I think it is a good thing to kind of put that front of mind and it also feels a little bit like a Hail Mary for the physical industry too because it kind of
1785711	1787733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1808530	1831098	where that's not possible I'm very curious what happens on that front but you know we'll see what the legal departments come up with yeah Bobby clarifies to be fair they can still say buyer purchase as long as it includes the license verbiage doesn't it have to be the same size as the buy like the license verbiage has to be the same size as buy because if that's the case they're not going to do it it's too that's too much too much wordy on the screen you know what I mean
1834197	1835879	I feel like they're going to bury it somewhere.
1835959	1837501	Does it count if they mention it in the EULA?
1837561	1844227	I feel like it will be buried and it's going to say add to library now or play now for the will be the button.
1845008	1850253	They're going to get around it because that's what happens all the time with these types of laws.
1850333	1850633	It's like
1852675	1854176	How far down this rabbit hole do I want to go?
1854677	1857339	It's like the plastic bag ban here in California.
1857499	1859761	Do you know what happened when they did the plastic bag ban?
1860302	1863164	Stores started selling a different kind of plastic bag.
1863504	1864445	And you know what's happening?
1864846	1866887	All those plastic bags are ending up in the trash.
1867248	1873033	So now they're having to do another bill to basically say you can't sell that plastic bag either.
1873053	1873133	Yeah.
1874321	1879224	and it's just, you know, they're gonna- Yeah, but the paper bags suck and I like the new plastic bags.
1879244	1883506	They're a lot thicker and so they don't, like, just fall apart like the old plastic bags.
1883527	1885768	Am I the only one that likes a paper bag?
1885928	1897275	I don't- I find that the paper bag, if it wasn't gonna break, the problem is they put a paper bag, you have a paper bag, and then they put, like, the teensiest- they attach it to a handle that is, like,
1898379	1900842	Like scotch taped to the bag, practically.
1901062	1903424	It is just like the weakest garbage ever.
1903464	1907308	Like Trader Joe's, for example, offers those paper bags.
1907488	1911512	And more times than not, those handles rip right off.
1911812	1917638	It's just... I mean, to be fair, you are supposed to use a recyclable bag, I should say.
1917698	1919921	But it's just like, sometimes...
1921700	1924261	Sometimes it's just not in the plan.
1924381	1926742	You go to something last minute and it's just not in the plan.
1926882	1928442	I don't think they just do it the way they used to.
1928802	1934704	They still charge you for a bag now but you could bring your own bags and then they just use those.
1936665	1937765	That's how it used to be.
1937785	1938806	That's how we used to do it.
1939006	1941647	I don't know.
1941787	1948149	I find it so funny that when I go to a store and purchase something
1949039	1951920	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1976230	2002283	SSJ100 Target for a while while they had those bags banned were giving out like for 10 cents you would get one of those like canvas bags and it would just be that was just the standard that they would hand out with it those were cool I'm like totally fine with those if that's what they want to move to because those hold up just fine and it's not plastic but I don't know it it
2002591	2007512	People need to carry stuff home, and they're just, they're not going to use recycled little bags.
2007712	2009873	Sorry, it's just not going to happen, so.
2011073	2017055	Audience chat says, every time I travel to, say, a GDQ and hit up a Target, the fact I have to pay for a bag is so weird.
2017315	2018475	Well, consider the reverse.
2018675	2022736	When I go to CVS at DragonCon, and then I'm like, wait, wait, wait, I get plastic bags?
2022816	2026157	I should, like, smuggle these home in my suitcase so I have something to put the cat litter in when I get home.
2028175	2030857	I bring my own bags usually when I shop.
2031217	2039703	I know, and a lot of people do, but sometimes like, you know, just realistically, I could have the bags in the back of the car and it still would make its way into the store.
2039803	2040703	I can't explain it.
2040903	2041504	It's just a thing.
2041744	2042024	Anyway.
2042945	2045186	All right.
2046247	2053571	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it involved bringing it home in a plastic bag or not.
2054572	2055753	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2056755	2057115	Busy.
2059296	2065198	I played a bunch of the stupid State Farm games and one of them made me play NBA 2K whatever and I hated it.
2067259	2067599	Sorry.
2067719	2069560	Don't like sports ball games.
2069800	2070960	Was that a booth at Twitch or something?
2072621	2073241	Jake was there.
2074241	2076662	I got a Jake from State Farm plushie.
2076782	2077743	Or pop figure, sorry.
2077823	2083685	He was part of the Twitch Rivals thing for some reason.
2083705	2083905	Isn't that
2084545	2089310	And then, like, at the Chevron booth I had to play... It wasn't... Was it Forza?
2090671	2095937	It was one of those racing games, and I'm used to playing with, like, an actual good wheel and a rig.
2096737	2100421	And that's the last time, literally, I've played, like, a racing game that wasn't R4.
2100822	2102423	Is Chevron not, like, a Jake?
2103124	2104045	Like, George the Gas?
2104065	2104405	I don't know.
2104585	2106447	But at any rate, though, like...
2107588	2116655	Since it was the last day, just for signing up for their little app, you get a $25 gift card, like a gas card, and then they gave me one just for trying the game.
2117155	2125802	And then this wonderful guy named Luke visiting from Scotland gave me two cards, so I have $100 in Chevron gas.
2126142	2130345	That bought you the gas to drive down there and back, to be honest.
2130585	2131566	And I drive a Fiat.
2132403	2157249	yeah that's a few tanks yeah that's nice just saying um but at any rate um i also can't find where i put them they're somewhere in my luggage um at any rate um i also uh like i said played para para um what was that what's that other not ddr game dance rush stardom yeah i played that that was pretty fun um and we also played uh disney's rave
2159451	2162935	That was... I'd forgotten how much fun that game was.
2165738	2171024	And you know, I've played... I haven't played any Dead by Daylight this week, honestly, enough.
2171104	2172085	But I did play Polya.
2174347	2177811	And the Suika game, the stupid watermelon game.
2179112	2179232	And...
2181154	2186656	and I ran around being absolutely in pain the entire time.
2187116	2191958	Oh, I wonder if Smuggler's Run counts as a game because I had to push a button a few times and I got a score.
2191978	2195500	I was going to say, was there like a particular Disneyland ride you enjoyed?
2195540	2196480	I mean, they're all good, but...
2197307	2200188	You know I love Rise of the Resistance and I did that shit twice.
2201069	2202810	Oh, I got flirted with by Kylo Ren.
2203570	2204230	Oh, fun.
2204551	2206932	Were you by yourself or were you hanging with other DVD people?
2206952	2208332	By myself, of course.
2208933	2209773	That's the best way.
2209933	2211114	Yeah, because single writer lines.
2212489	2214630	Well, I mean, not everything has single writer anymore.
2214831	2223256	But I had this goal that I was going to find a Kylo Ren and defect, just to be silly.
2223957	2224537	And I found one.
2224577	2227359	I was like, my lord, I defect to the First Order.
2227419	2232263	And he gets all up in my face and is like, remember this feeling.
2232763	2236706	You will remember it every day, the feeling of serving beneath me.
2236726	2237967	I'm like, oh, you flirting, dude.
2238327	2238607	Okay.
2239247	2239748	Yeah.
2240388	2241429	Yes, Kylo Ren!
2242350	2243071	Anyway, that was great.
2243091	2245674	It would only be good if your voice changed just like that.
2246875	2248337	Yes, Kylo Ren, uwu.
2250279	2251500	Thank you, daddy, uwu.
2252621	2255464	But I had such a fun time.
2256265	2256625	It was...
2257506	2261790	You know, and like, I actually went, they sell Disney themed Crocs.
2262670	2267174	And I realized that the problem was that my normal ones that I wear every day are like a size too big.
2268355	2270757	And so I went and got like sandals.
2270777	2273359	They're like Minnie Mouse sandals, but they're actually kind of cute.
2274320	2275080	And I wore those.
2275100	2277922	They're about the same price as like Crocs sandals would be outside the park.
2277962	2279003	So I wasn't mad about it.
2279844	2285729	And then I took out like these like compression bands that I use for art support and ballet class.
2286749	2311238	and I felt pretty okay the rest of the time you know until I got back and my feet were swollen um but I mean overall it was you know I'd say that a lot of it was more like there was gaming and then there was more gaming adjacent things but I also have to right now go on the record saying that I think if not for ballet I wouldn't have been able to play all those dancing games
2313055	2314815	and have stamina to do it.
2315555	2317536	I didn't really have stamina for those dancing games.
2318776	2332818	The first time I played Dance Rush I had to go back to my hotel with the light down because I was so exhausted and felt sick to my stomach from just over-exerting myself because I had been walking so much already.
2333279	2334599	I was like, why did I do that?
2335439	2341280	Well, that last day we played three games of that each and then I did five games of Parapara and then we did DDR.
2342280	2362343	is because I went because I hadn't played the game before and so I went from like you know I was like oh three stars that's nothing I'll play this seven star one it'll be fine you know and it's like yeah no that's way harder uh that is a lot harder uh it's really fun I just was disappointed that um
2363632	2378947	some of those songs were locked but I had my EMU's card I should have just scanned it and done that I really wanted to play Gimme a Big Beat because I love that song but I got to watch someone play it and that was just as fun
2380472	2404217	well I you know what it was I noticed myself doing like um every time it would say down you know when you're supposed to crouch or whatever I would do a plie and I was like man I thought you know my ballet class would be kind of proud of me because like now I just can't help it like if I jump it's like you know my feet go into the little arch and then fall back down and it's like
2404597	2431404	Ballet has ruined me for doing anything in this game but at least I'm like jumping and crouching properly and my back didn't really hurt so much so it was fun though I had I had a really I want to bring back the Bimani Knights I really do it was so much fun and it was fun because like and Loki I don't know if you got this feeling but it kind of felt like the old days didn't it a little bit yeah
2432031	2461823	yeah it really did and I was I'd be down for a trip for round one on a weeknight when it's not gonna be super crowded it it honestly was like one of the happiest feelings I think I've had in a long time just it was nostalgia and and just joy it was really a fun time this is actually really funny that you went down a Bimani nostalgia rabbit hole this week hold that thought so anyway if you're all done with your gaming week I'm gonna go to Loki yeah
2464517	2465898	Loki?
2467398	2469380	It's basically the stuff I mentioned before.
2469440	2472181	So Dance Rush Stardom, played a couple games of that.
2473722	2475923	Disney's Rave played a game of that.
2476783	2485648	And Minecraft this week, I've been just playing some stuff, just trying to work on the big build for this season.
2485688	2493152	Still stressing out about it because it's massive and I just need to get past it so that I can
2494471	2495951	Not stress out about it anymore.
2497652	2498752	But it's coming along.
2498912	2499853	It looks really cool.
2501633	2503694	It's so massive and there's so much to do.
2503794	2504934	It's very overwhelming.
2505174	2511176	And then next season I'm going to do something equally overwhelming but a different type of overwhelming so that'll be kind of fun.
2511876	2516598	And then we have new people joining up next season as well so that'll be fun as well.
2517438	2517778	I don't know.
2517798	2518598	I'm just looking forward to it.
2518658	2523580	But I have like three months I have left to get this done and I feel
2524500	2525080	The pressure.
2525321	2529403	It's like, I know how much time this is going to take and I don't have the time.
2529443	2531224	Plus, I have to get the rest of the park done too.
2531384	2534406	It's like, too much.
2535427	2538208	But I do have folks willing to help.
2538268	2543372	I just need to be able to figure out where I can have them help and then they'll do it.
2543432	2545933	It's just trying to figure all that out.
2546433	2548915	Now it's project managing, which is a whole other thing.
2549286	2558859	Yeah, it's just... The problem is I don't have... When I go into some of these projects, especially with a season, I have a vague idea of what I want to do, but I don't have it all planned out yet.
2559600	2563946	And so that's where the design process sometimes takes a long time because...
2564486	2565007	and DarkSakura.com
2585738	2590240	Based on the number of views that I get, no one's going to notice either way.
2590420	2592621	No, because that'll be the one that goes viral.
2592761	2594761	Watch, that'll be the one that Minecraft's going to retweet.
2594901	2595902	No, it's not.
2595942	2597062	We all do this.
2598163	2601684	My friend Jess on Channel 64 does the same thing.
2602584	2608987	It does end up pushing our quality much higher than other people, but at what cost?
2609567	2611468	It took them four months to get an episode out.
2611648	2612028	It's like...
2613307	2613688	I don't know.
2615469	2618651	It's a learning process still even three years into it.
2619192	2621954	Learning the balance polished versus...
2623126	2643463	you know simplicity to get content out because not everything has to be overly complicated you don't have to have the whole project done for one episode I'm having trouble breaking that habit but next season I will have to because it is impossible to get this project done in one episode it would just be ridiculous so I will have to break that habit
2645199	2646260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2665337	2667898	I don't know what it is I really want to stream.
2667938	2670718	I'm trying to figure that out and figure out what do I want to get back into.
2670878	2672639	I was kind of stewing on it.
2672759	2681841	I think a fun project might be to try to take on old games and try to beat as many as I can on stream.
2681921	2685642	Because Nintendo doesn't really have an achievement system.
2685882	2687422	And it's not that I'm a trophy whore.
2687802	2689423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2710676	2720779	I was kind of looking at like, okay, well, I wonder if somebody has built some type of mechanism to track maybe like a virtual trophy shelf or something.
2721139	2728221	And sure enough, and of course, this thing has existed on the internet for over a decade, and I just recently found out about it.
2728521	2732922	But there's this whole website, and it is emulators for better or for worse.
2733202	2733883	It is what it is.
2734003	2735343	Some people have their opinions on it.
2735763	2740505	I don't mind emulators because quite frankly, they can upscale games and make them really fun and do things with them.
2741466	2744927	But there's this whole thing called RetroAchievements.org.
2745388	2754372	And yes, it is a way to have an achievement system through retro games like emulating Nintendo, PlayStation, all of it.
2754412	2761335	Pretty much if RetroArch runs it, it's something that you can actually use emulators and have this achievement system in.
2761715	2764717	So I fell down a rabbit hole hard because I was like, okay,
2765217	2794095	so now this can be like the tracking system to sort of track the different games that I beat and there's even like this you know literal literal virtual yeah Bobby's saying waiting for Rob to discover crowd control next I literally have no idea what that is I'm gonna have to google it but anyway um so I haven't touched emulators in a long time to be honest so I kind of fell down this rabbit hole hard because at first I was like all right well let me see how this whole achievement thing works let me play like a Nintendo NES game and
2794396	2795879	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2804815	2811560	Retro Achievements actually sort of builds in a system to define what is the clear criteria for certain games.
2812140	2815362	And then I sort of realized after that, I was like, oh, you know what?
2815382	2818885	I would never really be able to stream old school DDR games.
2819305	2823128	I could go, I just want to go back and play like some DDR third mix, DDR fifth mix.
2823488	2825289	And that's exactly what I did.
2825489	2828811	I went in and I started playing some DDR fifth mix.
2828991	2833915	And like, yeah, there's just like a million achievements for these games because of course there's an achievement for like,
2834275	2838638	You full comboed on Basic, you full comboed on Trick, you full comboed on Maniac, and all this stuff.
2839239	2840940	And doubles, Loki, your favorite.
2841200	2853289	So, like, there's a million things to accomplish, but, like, I have quote-unquote beat DDR third mix at this point because I hit all the criteria, which was basically, I think it was, like, just clear every song.
2853309	2861514	You click here on progression, and then it says, like, you just have to beat all of these songs, basically, and then it is considered you have beaten the game.
2861614	2863456	So, according to this website, I have beat...
2863976	2869419	DDR Third Mix, which is a game I wouldn't really be able to stream anyway because of all the licensed music in it.
2870279	2874442	I only realized today, I was like, I guess I could stream Konomics.
2875022	2880625	That's the one DDR that's completely safe would be DDR Konomics because that was all the Konami originals in the US.
2880665	2882066	So maybe I'll save that one for someday.
2882486	2884167	And of course, everybody in chat is like,
2884907	2885968	I love retro achievements.
2885988	2886949	What do you mean you've never heard of it?
2887810	2889872	Pixelpaka says, I love retro achievements.
2890533	2892275	OrangeRite says, retro achievements is great.
2892535	2895198	Haven't tried it yet, but watch people who use it.
2896439	2901504	RecordWN in chat says, I played Super Mario 1 for an embarrassing amount of time last year with retro achievements.
2901824	2902345	So much fun.
2902685	2904627	S2-100 Matt has framed this perfectly in chat Rob found a shiny Yes
2923564	2948032	I found a shiny, exactly Bobby Blackwolf says crowd control hooks into games and lets Twitch chat influence your game to either help you or hinder you I've heard of that in like individual games I didn't know that so that's something you can even do in like retro games that's kind of cool, maybe I will look into that that might be kind of fun, who knows so anyway
2948812	2976087	that's the rabbit hole I fell down this week but DarkSakura when you were talking about kind of rediscovering your love of DDR and Bomani games I feel like I hit that same thing a completely different way like there's the path through the forest that diverge and go two different ways but at the end of the day we got to the same place I think that's really funny I think you liked one of my posts on social media about it because I was playing
2976667	2979209	I haven't heard some of these songs in a long time.
2979449	2985572	I remember Erotic and Captain Jack, but I was playing that If You Can Say Goodbye by The Kate Project, which is one of my favorite songs in DDR3 mix.
2985592	2987493	That song was stuck in my head all day, by the way.
2987573	2990535	I don't remember the last time I heard that song, right?
2991676	2994938	And I was playing that in the game, and I got a full combo and everything, and I was like...
2995658	2996278	Oh my god.
2996498	3001199	Like, this cheesy-ass Eurodance music really takes me back.
3001239	3010021	And I think I made a blue sky bleat that said something like, I will never apologize for loving cheesy Eurodance music.
3010301	3010961	No takebacks.
3011001	3011661	Doubling down.
3013141	3013822	Because it's true.
3014742	3017742	There's something about the cheesy songs that take me back to that place.
3018022	3019703	So, it's pretty amazing.
3020303	3020563	Alright.
3021483	3025966	Yeah, SS2100Matt says, gotta love a good Venn diagram, especially when it's Bomani related.
3026146	3026867	Certainly, certainly.
3026947	3028288	So that's a rabbit hole.
3028328	3035933	I will continue to find myself down off stream, but on stream, I will plan to take on some challenges next week.
3035993	3046820	And I already know what I want the first game to be because I believe in my heart of hearts, every retro project should always start from here on out with this game.
3047400	3049122	And of course, you know, I'm going to leave you with that teaser.
3049622	3050182	Tune in next week.
3050202	3051023	I'll tell you what it was next week.
3051643	3053145	So, all right.
3053686	3057050	With that, we're going to get into some more gaming news.
3057951	3069124	Before we get to that, though, I did just want to mention real quick, as I am aware that there's a big hurricane that happened on the East Coast, Hurricane Helene.
3069244	3070764	They shut down the Waffle House.
3070804	3074165	Yeah, and so you know shit got real if Waffle Houses were closing.
3074445	3078966	But on a serious note, I know that people passed away because of this, which is really, really sad.
3079046	3087327	But I know we may have some folks that live in western North Carolina or eastern Georgia that may have been impacted by this.
3087607	3088548	Bobby's in Atlanta.
3088608	3089208	He was fine.
3089228	3095829	I guess the original path of the hurricane was supposed to go his way, but it kind of veered a little more towards North Carolina.
3096489	3100912	But regardless of where it went, I hope those of you that were impacted by that are A-OK.
3101473	3103174	I was really sorry to hear about that.
3104015	3112621	Actually, and funny enough, I got a text during the show here at the beginning from one of my friends asking if I've heard from Extifer, because Extifer lives in North Carolina.
3113201	3114943	And yes, Xfer made a post this morning.
3115083	3122711	Xfer also lives in the Raleigh-Carrie-Durham Triangle area and which was, I believe, got a lot of rain.
3122791	3123651	Kind of similar to Atlanta.
3123671	3126394	A lot of rain, but not the full force of the storm.
3126835	3131599	So yeah, DJ Ranma S in chat says, one of my friends lost her trailer and everything.
3131719	3133401	That's really, that's really, really sad to hear.
3133421	3134342	I'm really sorry to hear that.
3134942	3141247	Um, so yeah, just anybody who may have been in the path of all that from Florida, because I know we have a lot of listeners in Florida.
3141868	3146111	Um, and I'm not sure I haven't checked in with last time I talked to X-Link.
3146131	3147232	That was a very long time ago.
3147292	3156699	I know he was in North Florida, so I don't know if he was impacted by any of that, but yeah, you know, I'm just, you know, I think about y'all that live in that part of the country often when these, uh, news happens.
3156739	3158620	So I hope you all are a okay.
3159381	3159621	All right.
3160669	3162370	Let's move on and get into some gaming news.
3163071	3164312	Oh, X-Link is in New York now.
3165073	3169816	I somehow missed the memo, but as far as this news is concerned, good.
3169836	3170497	I'm glad to hear it.
3171098	3171358	All right.
3172138	3181506	Let's move on with some gaming news and headlines and talk about what is going on this week in gaming, including Loki, Tokyo Game Show, right?
3181786	3182807	We got a lot out of that.
3183227	3189152	So there was an Xbox event at Tokyo Game Show, which you're like, well, why?
3189172	3189893	Because they're going to...
3190888	3192449	I guess they're still trying, so that's good.
3192489	3195229	Are they finally making a ploy for Japan again?
3195610	3197650	They're trying, I guess.
3198310	3204733	They had a bunch of trailers that they showed off, so starting off with a new trailer for Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake.
3206133	3208594	However, though, there's still no release date for it.
3210294	3217517	They had Overwatch 2 as getting a My Hero Academia mashup with new skins.
3220035	3244923	there's going to be an expansion coming to Age of Mythology Retold called Immortal Pillars that's coming to PC and Xbox Series X and S and let's see StarCraft 1 and 2 are going to be hitting Game Pass in November on PC that's pretty cool, November 5th
3246743	3257312	We have Tanuki Pon Summer, which is a BMX-like sim.
3257953	3259414	Is that Tanuki riding a bike?
3259774	3260975	Because that looks amazing.
3261816	3263397	It's from the makers of Curse of Golf.
3263658	3264718	Okay, it's going to be cute then.
3266160	3272165	It's a cel-shaded game inspired by Japanese small towns, and it's a construction sim with BMX tricks.
3272305	3272965	Okay, sold.
3273166	3273426	Done.
3274858	3275359	I'm buying it.
3275580	3276923	I don't know what it is, but I'm buying it.
3276943	3277384	It's cute.
3279770	3281073	No release date for that, though.
3281093	3281874	Good job, Microsoft.
3281894	3282335	You got him.
3283398	3283759	Got me.
3283899	3284200	Got him.
3286356	3291018	We have Threads of Time is coming out.
3291078	3293478	It's an HD2D RPG.
3294159	3298600	That's no release date on that, but it looks pretty cool.
3299440	3302901	We Love Katamari Reroll is on Game Pass.
3304542	3307122	We Love Katamari Reroll and Royal Reverie.
3307983	3310703	That's going to be awesome.
3310764	3313724	Check that out again, although I have it in my library already.
3314445	3315445	Frag Punk.
3316260	3319041	The Alchemists of Memories and the Envisioned Land
3343059	3347461	Sin Duality, Echoes of Ada, coming January 2025.
3348582	3352844	It's a third-person extraction shooter with a bunch of mechs.
3353344	3354164	That's pretty cool.
3356386	3359107	And Fallout 76 is getting pets.
3359587	3360588	It's all about the dog.
3362028	3367411	But in this case, you'll have dogs, cats, and other furry companions.
3367931	3370612	We're going to have cats that can kill things like...
3373083	3374444	What was your dog in Fallout 4?
3375725	3376226	Dog meat?
3376586	3377427	Is it going to be cat meat?
3379288	3384012	Suikoden Remaster is going to be Suikoden 1 and 2 Remasters.
3384293	3386254	I guess those are coming to Xbox as well.
3386755	3388576	And they showed off some more stuff for that.
3390780	3392501	All you need is help.
3418522	3421383	QGames, known for the PixelJunk franchise.
3421683	3424145	They have a multiplayer party game called All You Need Is Help.
3424645	3431368	It kind of looks like that Yarn Yoshi game, but it's a 3D Tetris type game with kind of that Yarn aesthetic to it.
3431628	3435830	Coming to Xbox Series X and S. PC and Game Pass.
3437030	3437530	Fun fun.
3438631	3440532	And then, of course, we've got...
3441598	3445839	Slitherhead, which was from the original director of Silent Hill.
3446419	3448100	So more shown on that.
3448220	3448980	Looks creepy.
3449540	3451341	Coming out on November 8th.
3452101	3458103	And then Starbites Tales of the Desert is a new sci-fi RPG.
3458223	3459863	I'm getting kind of like.
3461484	3466585	Fancy Star Online vibes, I guess, sort of, but the game looks sort of like Mega Man Legends.
3467586	3468346	So that's kind of cool.
3469622	3497733	Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D Remake is including a new class that's pretty cool and then oh yeah, Monster Wrangler is the new class that you'll get to be able to learn and use enemy abilities, that sounds like Final Fantasy 4 Final Fantasy 1 through 6 Pixel Remasters finally on Xbox X and S
3499225	3521166	and uh yeah I think the only bummer is it kind of feels like too late you know like I feel like most people that one of those games already picked them up if not the original release on PC then picked them up on you know PlayStation or Switch like you know Xbox being last to the ball really only caters to those where Xbox is their primary gaming system of
3521206	3522807	of which I do know a few people.
3522827	3534333	I know a fair percentage of people that, you know, they don't have a high-end PC, and so yes, their Xbox, especially Series S, being the, you know, a little more budget-friendly option, is the primary gaming device.
3534373	3540076	So I am happy for those folks, but it just, in some ways, it feels like, talk about being late to the ball.
3540857	3542117	Yeah.
3542177	3549001	Square Enix had a new trailer for the Mana port, so the Legend of Mana port,
3550018	3551479	and was it Trials of Mana?
3552319	3558021	They're also going to have a lot of that supported to Xbox PC and it's going to be on Game Pass as well.
3558041	3560322	The Mana games on Game Pass are a pretty big deal.
3561063	3568166	Trials and not Vision, the newest one, Visions, isn't on Game Pass but Trials and Legend, the PS1 reimagining is there.
3568286	3568546	Yeah.
3568686	3568866	Yeah.
3569724	3592034	so that's everything for the Tokyo Game Show Xbox showcase we also had on quickly before you go to the other what do you think of that like do you think they did enough like I think it's nice I mean it's one of those things you kind of go well at least they acknowledged Xbox acknowledged Japan you tried they certainly put some effort in I don't know we'll have to see what Japan thinks about it I mean true
3593432	3614122	I mean, I don't know, some of that stuff, like the Pixel Remasters doesn't really mean anything to me because it's like, I could play them on PC for a while now I agree with Mike Defko, Trials and Legends on Game Pass is great, I do agree like some of those Game Pass, and then We Heart Katamari also being on Game Pass great, especially when it feels like Game Pass has maybe been losing a little bit of value recently.
3614142	3621185	But that's been out forever though, I mean like I understand, like that's cool For people that didn't pick it up, and now Game Pass you know, it's included, it's
3621465	3624087	Every game they put on Game Pass enhances the value a little bit, right?
3624508	3625028	It's needed.
3625128	3641162	And the more like, you know, rooted in Japanese development type of games they can get on there, I think is good, not just for the Japanese audience, but really there's a large audience here in the States that likes to play Japanese developed games, you know, sometimes exclusively so almost.
3641463	3643064	So I think getting that type of stuff is huge.
3643484	3648389	I'm going to be one of those playing that, you know, that game with the Tanuki and the BMX bike.
3648729	3649689	Oh, you mean Minecraft?
3650690	3651270	I'm just kidding.
3652210	3654992	If only they had Tanooki and a BMX bike in Minecraft.
3655112	3656612	I mean, modded probably, but you know.
3658073	3660294	Alright, so not just Xbox, but...
3661089	3678489	but PlayStation so we had a state of play they showed off quite a few things with that as well first thing we had was a brand new free expansion or update for Astro Bot which is going to add new character cameos including those from Helldivers and Stellar Blade that's coming in this fall and
3679790	3699611	we had a trailer for something called Midnight Walk which is by the developers of Lost and Random it's a stop motion style horror game looks kind of creepy it's going to be out on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR 2 also a game called Hell Is Us
3700371	3712633	It's a science fiction Souls-like game, which I thought almost was Death Stranding at first, because the style of the costumes and everything looks very Death Stranding-like, but it is not.
3714134	3715934	And yeah, it's creepy looking.
3717074	3719795	Then we had Metro Awakening VR.
3720255	3725976	It is a new game in the Metro series that is coming out on PlayStation VR 2 on November 7th.
3728079	3730400	and yeah, I like the Metro series.
3730740	3731340	It's kind of cool.
3732701	3734381	We had ArcheAge Chronicles.
3734982	3738763	It's a fantasy action game, which looks pretty cool.
3738923	3744305	And that's going to have some multiplayer as well coming out on PlayStation 5 in 2025.
3745405	3748486	Palworld announced for the PlayStation 5.
3749807	3752088	That timing couldn't be any more awkward.
3752268	3753048	Hold that thought.
3753922	3755703	Yeah, it's coming.
3756323	3757904	Yes, we're going to talk about it next.
3757964	3759886	Hold that thought.
3760486	3769931	Lunar Remastered Collection, which is including Lunar The Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar Eternal Blue Complete with updated visuals.
3770132	3773674	The number of friends I have that said, that's all I needed.
3773834	3774394	Pack it up.
3774494	3774954	That's it.
3776055	3777836	That's the announcement for me.
3778416	3779237	Fuck everything else.
3779777	3780218	Pack it up.
3781318	3781798	I get it.
3781838	3782179	I get it.
3782239	3782419	I do.
3782819	3788421	Yeah, it's got updated visuals, widescreen mode, and it's coming out on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 in 2025.
3788861	3804185	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge, which is also showing, they were showing off the new update Radical Reptiles DLC, which adds Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa as new playable characters.
3805000	3814663	as well as the game getting a remixed an additional remixed soundtrack with several guest composers including I saw Onomatoguchi which is awesome.
3815783	3818244	So that is available now.
3820004	3831348	We have the Sonic Sonic X Shadow Generations is getting some new levels based off of the new film as well as
3832188	3842827	Keanu Reeves voicing Shadow in the update as well and that is coming out December 12th
3844380	3869780	then we have Fantasian Neo Dimension yeah Fantasian Neo Dimension which they showed off has the Nobuo Matsu music in it as well coming out on December 5th on PlayStation 4 and 5 it's a turn-based RPG thank god another turn-based RPG DarkSakura streamed that on that was on Apple Arcade exclusive
3870040	3872881	I like that you can store your random encounters and do them all at once.
3893632	3894214	That's pretty cool.
3894415	3894997	Oh, that's funny.
3896863	3899492	BioWare showed off new footage for Dragon Age Veilguard.
3901773	3904455	Oh fuck, that's coming too in October.
3905195	3905895	October 31st.
3905995	3908797	I'm going to be broke.
3908957	3912559	I'm not even as into Dragon Age as you, Shane, and a lot of other people I know.
3913359	3916401	This looks great.
3916941	3918022	Please don't let me down.
3918062	3919342	I can't wait for the reviews to come out.
3919723	3924465	Not that I let the reviews dictate, but it's a decent barometer.
3924705	3927347	If all of the reviewers are saying, Duty...
3928207	3933350	or a 10 out of 10 amazing, then it's a pretty decent barometer of where it's going to go.
3933570	3942376	Or if they just pull all the reviews, pull all the review copies before it goes out, that always is a good sign as well.
3942656	3944937	Unless that game gets delayed, which it did.
3946818	3953127	The Lake House, Alan Wake 2's new expansion is coming in October and looks creepy.
3953428	3956973	At first I thought this was almost like a game based off of Cabin in the Woods.
3957293	3959296	That's what the vibes were I was getting from that.
3959316	3961319	I was like, holy, they're making a game based off Cabin in the Woods?
3961339	3962621	Not an M. Night Shyamalan game.
3964212	3966614	Well, Cabin in the Woods, wasn't it?
3966814	3967194	Whedon?
3967434	3969516	I'm thinking of a different movie.
3969756	3970076	Never mind.
3970196	3971157	No, I know what you're thinking.
3971297	3973999	You're thinking of... The Village?
3974099	3981465	No, the one where the people show up and tell the gay couple they have to kill each other or all of humanity is going to die or something like that.
3982485	3984007	Oh, yeah, The Watchers or something like that.
3984067	3985067	I don't remember.
3985087	3987169	To be fair, it took place in the Cabin in the Woods.
3990000	3994063	and then Hitman World of Assassination on PlayStation VR 2.
3994223	3994804	Looked kind of cool.
3995725	3997046	Not gonna lie.
3998427	4010256	Legend of Kain Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered which leaked out early but you know they officially announced it as well so that's coming December 10th on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
4012717	4015299	Fear the Spotlight is
4017566	4022451	Apparently one of the new Blumhouse horror games that's being developed.
4022492	4025815	Remember during Summer Game Fest when they announced that they were going to have all those games coming?
4026336	4030160	Yeah, so that's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 coming out October 22nd.
4031641	4034004	Towers of Azaba.
4035786	4039210	It's an island building game coming to early access in November.
4040941	4043604	Lego Fortnite is coming.
4044986	4054678	I thought that was already available on console, but they're going to be doing a Lego Fortnite DualSense controller or a Fortnite DualSense controller.
4056011	4056532	Oh, that's right.
4056692	4058755	Split screen mode is coming to PlayStation 5.
4059576	4060337	So that's kind of cool.
4060357	4064282	So you can play a two-player LEGO Fortnite split screen on one system.
4064362	4070190	But then they're also doing a Fortnite DualSense controller, which is available for pre-order soon.
4072064	4095419	um and then Dynasty Warriors Sia Tiberius said it in chat and this is going to bug me if no one did Sia Tiberius says the movie I was thinking of is called Knock at the Cabin but it's based off a book called Cabin at the End of the World so the cabin cabin something close gotcha um not that I'm confused with Cabin Fever whole different movie um Dynasty Warriors Origins um
4095999	4107500	it is a Dynasty Warriors game I can confirm that with the trailer that is coming out January 17th we got an extended trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds um
4109714	4136320	I'm excited for those people that like Monster Hunter I am not one of them unfortunately I never get into Monster Hunter games except Monster Hunter Now is so good like that is so fun to play with friends like and they the quality of life updates they've done in that this is a Niantic game like Pokemon Go but it's done it's done by the Niantic Japan so whatever studio they acquired they turned into Niantic Japan does the Monster Hunter Now game and when I tell you
4137566	4164973	if you play Pokemon Go check out Monster Hunter now just to see what kind of quality of life features they have so you can be so fucking mad that they aren't in Pokemon Go because it's so good like anyway but the reason why I say that is it kind of makes me want to go play the mainline Monster Hunter games because the monsters all come from the mainline Monster Hunter games I'm like oh I could kind of get into this if this is what like the Monster Hunter mainline games are
4166727	4193108	I know what's great is like all this talk about Monster Hunter and this and that we all forgot that Monster Hunter the movie was actually a thing but now you remember um I'll forget again thanks it's alright we'll all forget uh so Horizon um we got a new trailer for Lego Horizon Adventures which looks kinda cool uh that's gonna be coming out here very soon um
4195740	4208413	However, and this I think fits into that same camp of, you know, the remaster that we just had with The Last of Us, which is like, why are we remastering this again?
4208513	4212237	But Horizon Zero Dawn remastered is a thing that's coming out.
4213338	4216401	So that's being remastered just even though that game...
4216829	4245507	original PlayStation 4 game came out not that long ago however if you do own the original PlayStation 4 version you can just upgrade for $10 so at least that's good yeah that's good and the The Last of Us upgrades and all that and the other games they've gone back and done that with seem to do decently so I'm not really surprised I also think it's I think there's probably going to be PS5 Pro enhancements in that and that's what they really want to show off I think that's well they didn't really show yeah I don't know
4246387	4252549	The PS5 Pro didn't really land with us here at OLR, so I'm sure they're trying to put more and more into that wherever they can.
4253590	4259812	Yeah, but the remaster is rumored to be coming to PC and PlayStation 5, so that'd be cool.
4260472	4270216	Then we have Stellar Blade is getting a photo update as well as Nier Automata crossover collaboration content that's coming out later this year.
4271476	4298310	we also got some more talk about PlayStation Plus which you're going to be able to get the Dead Space remake Doki Doki Literature Club WWE 2K24 as well as Blood Omen Legacy of Kain and Dino Crisis from the original PlayStation are going to be added to the Classic Collection The Last of Us Part 1 will be joining the PlayStation Plus game catalog
4300256	4305899	already, as of Thursday, to commemorate The Last of Us Day, a made-up holiday.
4307200	4308901	Chroma Collection.
4308981	4317746	So PlayStation, they're going to have some console covers and controllers that are, like, shiny.
4318187	4320968	They have, like, a metallic purple, a metallic white.
4322169	4323830	I guess it's kind of, like, iridescent.
4323950	4326852	And then some metallic green color.
4327472	4328072	It'd look nice.
4328112	4328733	Wouldn't buy them, though.
4330058	4350116	and uh talking about PlayStation 5 Pro updates they listed some of the games they're going to be supporting uh new enhancements for PlayStation 5 Pro including you know Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Horizon Forbidden West, Last of Us Part II, Gran Turismo 7, Outlaw Wake 2 and so on and so forth lots of games um
4351440	4377123	and then the big hey look at this we've got one more thing Ghost of Yotai and looks amazing so amazing so that Assassin's Creed got delayed wow the power the power it has to just knock Assassin's Creed into next year it's like oh this game looks awesome Assassin's Creed will be released in our game in February now is Ghost of Yotai coming out this year?
4378993	4380414	I don't think so.
4380474	4382035	I assumed it was a 2025 game.
4382095	4384036	Yeah, so what's Assassin's Creed running from?
4384056	4384276	Yeah, 2025.
4384676	4385917	What's Assassin's Creed running from then?
4386777	4387358	I don't know.
4387458	4391900	I don't know if it's because of that, but they had originally pulled review copies.
4393061	4395802	Reviewers weren't going to get review copies, and then they delayed it.
4396343	4399625	Oh, that means, yeah, broken bugs.
4399785	4400565	Okay, interesting.
4401165	4404507	QuestBuster in chat says, Ghost of Yotei looks so good as a Ghost of Tsushima fan.
4404527	4404807	It does.
4404867	4405448	I can't wait.
4406168	4411313	It looks... That game, that right there, that's a perfect game to showcase.
4411613	4412394	But here's the thing, though.
4413234	4414536	Put that quote on the back of the box.
4414676	4416257	Loki, OLR, it's a perfect game.
4416277	4416958	No, no, no, no, no.
4416998	4417658	Hold on, hold on.
4418279	4419460	I'm not endorsing anything.
4419520	4420180	I'm just saying.
4421502	4421662	So...
4423430	4434519	What they showed off looks incredible, but the reason why... We don't know if that's PlayStation 5 Pro footage or PlayStation 5 footage.
4434879	4437801	Like, is it... Oh, they said this is like PlayStation 5...
4439062	4443925	or PlayStation Pro footage or whatever like that, then that could possibly sell the console.
4443985	4451309	But it could be just that this is being shown off and make the assumption that it's a pro that's doing this and not the regular console.
4451329	4452370	Which is a safe assumption to make.
4452490	4457693	Everything here on out at a Sony show that is in-game footage is being done on a pro.
4457713	4457793	Bet.
4458113	4460835	There's no reason for them not to.
4460855	4463056	Yeah, but what's it going to look like on a regular PlayStation 5 then?
4463136	4463456	I don't know.
4463476	4464277	Why should they bother showing you?
4466218	4470023	because they still sell those consoles and I would like to know what it looks like.
4470404	4472907	It'll be shelved away on a YouTube comparison video somewhere.
4474529	4475651	You'll find it if you know where to look.
4476801	4498163	yeah all right digital foundry waiting for your review lots of big game announcements this week with Tokyo Game Show and the Sony State of Play lots of big stuff to look forward to um and that's not even where the big news ends because we had another major development on another front on the Nintendo front and yes we're going to talk about the shoe and
4498323	4498823	PowerWorld.
4498863	4499423	That's right.
4499483	4509566	The shoe showed up and said that it wasn't Gavin opening the ceiling and the microphones fall out.
4509626	4509886	Nope.
4509906	4512446	A Nintendo opened a trap door and a shoe fell.
4512887	4513327	And that's right.
4513347	4514787	The other shoe, it finally dropped.
4514927	4515787	On to PowerWorld thing.
4516347	4518428	You might remember that back in January...
4519088	4523471	January, the Pokemon company said they were going to investigate PAL World.
4523891	4526693	And we were sitting there going, oh, give it a few weeks.
4526793	4527994	It's going to happen.
4528094	4528514	We're done.
4528974	4530215	And nothing ever kind of happened.
4530655	4535058	And it was kind of getting to the point where we were like, well, is Nintendo even going to do anything at this point?
4535138	4536479	Well, here it is.
4537259	4547506	September 18th, Nintendo and the Pokemon company released a statement saying they are suing PAL World developer Pocket Pair on the grounds of patent infringement.
4548373	4556577	The full statement says, Nintendo, together with the Pokemon Company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court against Pocket Pair Inc.
4556978	4557478	on September 18, 2024.
4557918	4568444	The lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the defendant, infringes multiple patent rights.
4569184	4569564	and DarkSakura.
4591556	4594383	So this is going to be something that's handled in the Japanese court.
4594764	4599817	So I'm not sure why all the websites are going to American lawyers comment on it, but sure, we got that.
4600680	4601660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4622905	4634609	Those pals in Palworld, some of them look very inspired by and in a questionable gray zone of legally distinct from Pokemon stuff.
4635549	4644732	And there have been some social media posts that really, like the people that opened the fucking models in Blender and shit and really took a deep dive to be like, yo, this is really close.
4644772	4650374	And I thought that would be the stuff that Nintendo would latch onto and then take into court.
4650734	4654296	But that does not appear what's happening at all because this is a patent lawsuit.
4655257	4658999	And to be honest, I'm not sure I get this.
4659640	4660520	And I'm going to explain why.
4660600	4664583	Because, well, again, we don't know what patent – we do not know what patent it is.
4664843	4667225	There's a lot of theories as to what patent it is.
4667445	4669926	There's a lot of people that have been doing some investigating trying to figure this out.
4670066	4670707	And the most –
4671564	4672784	I'm going to use your word, everybody.
4672864	4673785	Get the shot glass ready.
4674145	4682707	The most plausible scenario is that it has to do with Pokemon's mechanic of basically throwing a ball at a monster.
4683027	4685728	The monster goes in the ball, and the ball is yours to keep.
4685828	4694550	That, in a nutshell, and I'm paraphrasing, is the patent that Nintendo may have actually filed in the last year.
4694670	4696431	That's another thing people are trying to figure out.
4697111	4698912	so that they could go after PAL World.
4699413	4706438	But it is, well, it's weird to me that they're doing this and not the trademark copyright thing.
4706478	4711282	But, you know, the fact that it's taken nine months, there's been a lot of meetings.
4711942	4715565	And for whatever reason, Nintendo's legal team feels like this is the way to go.
4715625	4720889	But trust, if they went and filed a patent, if they decided to go about it this way,
4722445	4724566	Their problem is what the Pokemon look like.
4724706	4727347	I even called them Pokemon.
4727407	4727627	Oops.
4727927	4730048	Put that in court.
4730888	4733149	The pals look too much like Pokemon.
4733229	4734410	That's the real problem.
4734830	4740152	This is what everybody's pissed off about in Nintendo and Pokemon companies' world.
4740956	4757623	I actually think it's a little bit dangerous for Nintendo to have that sort of patent on that mechanic because there's a lot of fan Pokemon games and things that have come out that are legally distinct enough from Pokemon that these are very clearly like...
4758483	4760904	They're pocket monster collecting games.
4761845	4764586	They're made out of a love of Pokemon and that whole world.
4764606	4766187	They're not going to infringe on anything.
4766507	4768288	They should be allowed to exist as well.
4768729	4773511	And if Nintendo is able to kind of get Power World on that, I almost think it's a little bit dangerous.
4774131	4778554	But just because I don't like it doesn't mean it isn't the way the world is going to work.
4778994	4780715	And do you know what a great example of that is?
4782250	4783631	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4801528	4804270	and some of his, at the time he was doing a lot of mobile gaming projects.
4804310	4806552	I remember I ran into him at PAX and that's PAX East.
4806572	4811616	That's how the whole thing started where we did the interview on the show and he was doing a lot of mobile games at the time.
4812337	4823126	And the reason why I say go listen to that interview, he talked a lot about patents and what Konami basically owned in the music space and
4823846	4825547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4847233	4867266	and the default is that and it's five panel I'm inferring because again he hadn't created the game yet at the time but I'm inferring that's what because it's again to get distinct enough from that patent because in that whole experience if Konami really wants to go after you they will there was a lot of other music games they didn't go after but they went after that one
4869563	4882857	and you know again I'm not trying to rehash old history but I can't help but see a little bit of a parallel here between that and if Konami really wants to shut the game down they will and what Nintendo is trying to do here with this whole thing.
4884761	4885142	Thank you.
4885302	4889646	SSJ100Matt says episode 596 date May 3rd, 2015.
4891027	4893989	So you'll have to actually go to the OL Archive to find it.
4894049	4895691	I don't think that's... Actually, no.
4896191	4899875	I think our live... Actually, I want to say our server goes back to episode 500.
4900655	4903476	So that might still actually live on our servers if you want to check that out.
4903916	4905637	It was a really, really good interview.
4906557	4910219	Again, that's a nine-year-old interview at this point, so keep that in mind.
4910559	4910979	But it's good.
4911039	4914520	And Dark Tetsuya does remind us, by the way, the OLR wiki is back.
4915341	4915881	There was a hold.
4916061	4916582	Yes, it is.
4916822	4917522	Thank God.
4917563	4918684	The OLR Wiki is back.
4918804	4920205	Thank you to DarkTetsuya.
4920545	4922307	I believe Bobby Blackwolf had a hand in that.
4922407	4923989	I know OrangeRite has done some updating.
4924369	4927192	So thank you to everybody who got the OLR Wiki back online.
4927472	4930835	Apparently there was a transcript of a Travis Donovan spinoff show.
4931516	4949508	That they did not care for I know, I was like, once I heard Oh, it was a Travis Donovan show I was kind of like, what the fuck was a transcript Of one of his shows doing on the Not that, I love Travis, it's not that It's just, I know he says a lot of Back in the day, he said a lot of crude things And I was like, why was that living on the wiki anyway?
4949808	4959034	I love Travis We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him Please don't get me wrong But I'm just like The man is a living explicit tag Like
4961744	4962244	All right, anyway.
4963105	4963986	We love him more.
4964126	4964606	That's right.
4964747	4965027	All right.
4965187	4965507	That's right.
4965988	4970171	Anyway, RecoWN in chat says, sounds like there's a problem with games and patent law.
4970211	4970391	Yep.
4971773	4974355	Patenting such specific ideas seems wild.
4974455	4974635	Yep.
4974935	4977818	I would say that there's a problem with patent law, period.
4978558	4984964	I think that whole thing, especially in light of the California law we talked about at the top of the show.
4986294	4994077	This really screams that this entire thing needs looked at because obviously the technology is evolving faster than the law is.
4994677	4999899	And we all know why because the fucking politicians can't agree on shit.
5000460	5003661	And they get paid to not care.
5004021	5011364	But they've got to figure this out because, well, and then of course I say that, but this issue was filed in Japan.
5011604	5013505	So honestly, it actually wouldn't matter.
5014588	5024837	But I feel like when it comes to especially Hollywood-related things, it's kind of like the California law is going to change the way the rest of the country goes.
5025357	5031523	Now, I think it would be a bit bold to say a change in American law would change the way the rest of the world goes, but...
5032918	5034659	How about European laws?
5034979	5039380	Some of the European technology laws are changing the way it goes for everybody else.
5039500	5041241	It can happen.
5042021	5050224	Wasn't there some laws that were in place in China or something like that that was about the loot box percentages, like the drop rates or something like that?
5050444	5051945	I actually feel like that was Belgium.
5052045	5055166	I feel like it was one of the across the Atlantic.
5055206	5056106	I don't think it was China.
5056146	5060388	It may have been China too, but I want to say it was one of the across the Atlantic countries that did that.
5061489	5083369	and yeah had an effect so yeah yeah anyway it's going to be interesting to see where this ends up but the reality is hashtag it's complicated us armchair experts do not have an easy solution to this so I'm curious to see how this plays out but I will say as much as I think like look
5084727	5101588	multiple things can be true I can sit here and say I see how PowWorld is not Pokemon with guns and that hashtag did that game dirty or I should say that subtitle that a bunch of journalists slapped on that game that subtitle did that game dirty that game is not Pokemon with guns
5102128	5108752	I can say that and notice this game is more of a survival-based game that kind of takes some of these mechanics and it does different things.
5108952	5111494	Actually, it's not Pokemon at all, actually.
5112034	5119919	I can sit there and say that is true, but then I can also say, but damn, they lifted those monster graphics straight out of Pokemon and made changes to them.
5120179	5120679	They did.
5121060	5121520	I'm sorry.
5121720	5122340	They sure did.
5124061	5125662	I'm really not going to be convinced otherwise.
5125702	5125983	Sorry.
5126923	5128264	Both those things can be true.
5129185	5138133	So it is a little weird for me to go, it's weird that Nintendo is going to possibly go after them on the first of those things rather than the second.
5139434	5141235	And that's where this gets really muddy for me.
5141476	5148562	And I actually, I'm not sure I want Nintendo to win that kind of patent lawsuit because what's that going to do to all the fan games?
5149122	5154427	So my point is, I think Nintendo does have a case against Palworld.
5155543	5157225	I didn't think this was the case.
5158988	5159889	But I'm not a lawyer.
5160050	5161532	It doesn't fucking matter what I think.
5165457	5170580	SGO and Hunter Matt says, yeah, this isn't Nintendo taking down a fun fan project remaking a Nintendo title.
5170900	5172081	Nintendo has a case here.
5172461	5172881	True.
5173101	5175663	But we see Nintendo going after a lot of the other stuff.
5175783	5179805	I mean, you know, with fan titles, fan titles is always a gray area, right?
5179965	5187730	Like they go after some, you know, thing like that, like the music on YouTube and things like that, where it's just kind of like one of those, like, can't you just let it go?
5187970	5189891	Like they go after these weird things sometimes.
5190351	5193893	And I think we all know Nintendo can sometimes be overly litigious, right?
5195136	5219705	and again, I think they've got a case against Palworld but in a different way but I think here's the thing, if they'd gone against just the monsters that lets Pocket Pair change out the monsters and still keep the game Nintendo wants their fucking head, that's what this is about Nintendo wants them to have to gut something that gets the game pulled completely
5221004	5222365	That's the key difference here.
5223006	5224447	Nintendo's going for their head.
5225067	5227189	They're going to totally try to copy it is what they're going to do.
5227209	5230171	They're going to kill that game and then they're going to copy the mechanics of it.
5230532	5232733	Not with the guns, but the survival aspect.
5232753	5237537	There'll be some new Pokemon game that has survival stuff and then they do that.
5237778	5238498	Oh my God.
5238979	5239859	You know what, Loki?
5240320	5241060	I hate to say it.
5241220	5242681	I think you are absolutely right.
5243402	5243562	or, or, or
5260492	5265479	They already have one in development, and they're worried that they're going to call the PAL world ripoff.
5266400	5267842	And so they're just trying to kill them.
5268322	5271587	Either way, though, it's just petty to try to kill off another game company.
5271627	5274371	Well, but to be fair to Nintendo...
5275552	5278233	That game company lifted the Pokemon.
5278253	5278914	Like, let's be real.
5278934	5279674	I mean, that's fair.
5279694	5280815	There can be only one.
5280835	5281395	That is true.
5281615	5286898	I mean, there are a lot of companies that are blatantly trying to steal things and completely copy that.
5286938	5294222	Like, the other one we talked about that was basically like a survival game with a very strong Animal Crossing aesthetic to it.
5295982	5296263	Yeah.
5296663	5304627	Now, MikeDev does point out in chat, has some opinions here talking about, you know, Power World plays different than Pokemon and talking about we already have Legends Arceus.
5305165	5305885	for fuck's sake.
5306045	5308047	It has survival elements already.
5308507	5316271	Maybe there's something about Pokemon ZA that they want to do that they think Power World... Let's be real.
5316351	5319733	Nintendo's just pissed off about the rampant success of Power World and wants to shut it down.
5319813	5320973	That's what it is.
5322534	5324595	Again, I think Nintendo has a case.
5324775	5326196	I just didn't think they had this case.
5326796	5327517	But I'm not a lawyer.
5327537	5327657	Also,
5329053	5350796	also make sure that your target has some blood in that stone to squeeze out that was something I said earlier in chat but I also think there's an advantage to waiting to see to gauge exactly what success and income is going to be off of that profit that they're making and then plan accordingly
5352321	5357064	Now, real quick before we get to our next story, I want to mention another Nintendo lawsuit story.
5357164	5363587	But, you know, even if this one you are angry at, you think it stifles competition or whatever, I think this next one we can all agree.
5364948	5366369	I am with Nintendo's lawyers on this.
5366489	5366929	I don't know.
5367009	5368310	Somebody out there will be contrarian.
5368390	5370131	But I am with Nintendo's lawyers on this one.
5370471	5374273	And that is Nintendo is now apparently going after...
5375922	5379304	I hate calling it X, but since we're talking about a lawsuit... This is Twitter.
5379464	5379865	It's Twitter.
5379905	5380425	It's Twitter.
5381205	5391412	But Nintendo is going after Twitter because it's Grok, the AI chatbot that's integrated into the Twitter X platform.
5392549	5398674	It includes AI-generated images, including images of Mario.
5399294	5406961	And Grock doesn't seem to have some of the same safety mechanisms in place that other AI programs and chatbots do.
5407041	5414326	So you can actually get it to do Mario to do things that Nintendo would not want to see Mario doing, like smoking, drinking.
5414947	5419871	Apparently there are AI-generated images of Mario that were made on Grock that have been hit by
5420131	5449121	with DMCA takedowns those were handled by a company called Tracer which is supposedly doing this on Nintendo's behalf but of course there has been no comment at this time but this is the one where you go yeah this one makes sense so anyway I'm all for Nintendo taking Elon Musk's money do that get him get him get him alright
5451243	5451924	Let's move on.
5452024	5458889	Let's talk about this next story about another company's leadership structure that needs to get got.
5459130	5461632	And DarkSakura, give us some light on this.
5464975	5468798	So, yeah, Ubisoft.
5469298	5479747	I don't know really what to say about Ubisoft that we haven't already really said, but their shareholders are not good.
5484231	5509806	so at any rate it actually is going to go back another step is that they had with poor sales of Star Wars Outlaws there are even more shadows that are just going over them they've had to postpone the release date of Assassin's Creed Shadows and they've taken a financial hit for all of this and Guillaumont has said that they had started an investigation
5510926	5536773	uh looking better at their financial targets and how to better do a player-centric approach to all of you know their basically we just want to make we want their money we want their money also that they'll do an investigation for but not the um all the sexual harassment and mismanagement in the company there's more there's more um he put out a letter to the employees stating that um
5538431	5552226	that he was trying to learn from a mistake to be a good motivation for future action and had talked about making changes in their upper management.
5554390	5571542	but the big thing is that investors are really loud about wanting to boot him out of the company like a big old boot to the ass and we agree but there's now a little bit more where 10% of the shareholders are supporting an option to sell the company
5573243	5575324	sell to an outside source.
5575805	5588013	And this was pretty much brought out by AJ Investments and the same company wanting the removal of Guillemot as a CEO.
5588574	5593457	They managed to gain support from 10% of the company's shareholders to push this.
5593497	5600683	They wanted to sell to, quote, external entities or as part of the so-called, quote, private equity for a pair price.
5601503	5611093	So there hasn't been any announcement out there from either Gamont or from Tencent, the two highest shareholders of the company.
5611954	5613215	But we'll see what happens.
5614241	5616602	I find this news to be exciting, quite frankly.
5616842	5628767	And I understand this AJ Holdings may be some sort of activist shareholding company, but in this case, I'm all for this kind of activism because I really feel like what they are doing... We said this years ago.
5628827	5638011	Remember when Konami made all these shitty decisions back to back to back and we really landed on the whole, if you really want to affect change at a company, you're going to have to be a shareholder.
5638431	5641112	And as SSJ100Matt puts it in chat, which is...
5641852	5643053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5670253	5670293	Um.
5686404	5692050	QuestBuster in chat says Ubisoft has been trying to catch up with the rest of the industry for years
5703101	5731586	with extremely mixed results burning through so much talent and cash and let's be real there have been tons of shitty stories out of Ubisoft recently and I'm sorry to the front end employees that are working their ass off there you know trying to create good products I'm not saying like every Ubisoft game is shit but I am saying there are a lot of shit policies that are coming from the very top out of Ubisoft remember the thing about AI writing quests and dialogue and all that shit guess what company jumped onto that train early
5732466	5732966	Choo Choo.
5733006	5733407	That's right.
5733487	5735368	It was Ubisoft did that.
5736749	5748536	Guess what company pulled the crew from sales so hard that now California has passed a law to make it so that that is going to be a bunch.
5748636	5750497	I have to be more transparent in the future.
5751718	5752238	That's right.
5752378	5753279	It's Ubisoft.
5753859	5757902	Well, they also forced an offline mode to be developed for the crew to
5759029	5778790	Motorfest and The Crew 2 I think as well there is no easy way to put it and the shareholders need to hear it and congratulations to the 10% that have Yves Guillemont is the problem cut him out
5780444	5782226	You know it's not gonna happen, though.
5782286	5788172	They'll let the company sink before they let them go unless they get an even bigger majority to push the issue.
5788292	5788772	I have 10% faith.
5791721	5817712	and maybe it'll grow by next week now of course it should be noted and I you might I just bolding underlining it the Gilmont's actually own a stake in Ubisoft that's going to make this whole thing a lot shittier and Tencent but they're the two biggest holders Tencent probably has a lot more money to buy out that stuff that share if they wanted to which I I feel is how this whole thing ends I think Tencent buys the rest of it out but we'll see we'll see what happens
5818499	5839279	and then Gamonk gets a huge payout and that's gonna be the worst part oh god so angry so angry, alright, anyway let's talk about, we need to go visit a happy place, so Loki let's go to your happy place, let's go to Minecraft because Minecraft had some updates this week as well, right?
5839775	5847137	Yes, Minecraft Live 2024 just was on Saturday, and they announced a few things.
5847657	5864342	So, first thing they announced before all of this is that they're going to be focusing on smaller updates going forward instead of a larger themed update, which makes sense because the last few themed updates, they've been just putting stuff out and trying to... It's like, okay, we've got all these pieces...
5865262	5866843	What is the picture that this makes?
5869185	5870666	Tales and Trails?
5871047	5871887	There you go!
5872068	5876831	It felt very disjointed, some of the stuff that they would put out.
5877092	5884678	But now it's focused on much smaller things, and some of these are called Game Drops now, these smaller updates.
5884798	5893104	So the first Game Drop that's right around the corner is the Bundles of Bravery, and what that is is essentially...
5893965	5898467	Bundles coming out of it being an experimental feature in the game.
5899087	5902128	They have now dyeable colors of the bundles and everything.
5902929	5905410	And hardcore mode for Bedrock.
5905430	5909792	God, I hope they fix all the bugs of that because that was so buggy.
5910792	5912613	But that's supposed to be coming out very soon.
5912653	5914634	I think probably by the end of next month.
5916883	5923128	Then, of course, the fun part, all of their announcements for the new biome got leaked.
5923688	5927631	So, first, first, they leaked it themselves.
5927951	5934416	They updated their page with the recap information for the event before it went live.
5934897	5935977	Whoopsie, everybody.
5936898	5940321	We actually found it and posted about it online and stuff.
5941181	5942342	And then it started to spread.
5942763	5943183	But then...
5944884	5970311	then later somebody who was in charge I think of subtitling the the after show video started leaking screenshots from the video and so there was that as well which basically leaked all of the announcements so what were those announcements a brand new biome to the game that's kind of a different take on the dark oak forest called the pale garden it's like a very desaturated uh
5972062	5973423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5997093	6005700	and um it's less of a dark black forest and more of a dark gray forest I guess um
6006813	6027528	so you can't actually kill this mob you have to when you hit it it basically creates this like particle effect that points to a creaking heart which is within these trees so think of like the creaking as like a puppet and these trees are where are controlling it and so you can actually you have to take that heart out of the tree in order to be able to defeat the monster and
6028328	6052995	and then um it has a new white wood type with like black bark which is it's all right but that's uh the the smaller drop that's going to be coming later on uh possibly within they said within the next few months they're also promising that they're going to be doing Minecraft lives instead of once a year it's going to be twice a year so the next one's going to be in the spring of 2025 and we'll hear more about that but more importantly we also heard about
6054484	6063547	They showed a scene and a little bit of behind the scenes of the Minecraft movie, which I have to say did a better job of showcasing the Minecraft movie than the trailer that they had out.
6063947	6073449	But we did get a little bit more context to the scene from the trailer where Jason Momoa's character is making something on the crafting table and makes some weird bucket thing with chains and stuff.
6074330	6078531	So essentially Jason Momoa's character is supposed to be playing kind of like a...
6080747	6106126	80s video game champion type guy I think Billy Mitchell but now thrown into this world and he thinks he's like a know-it-all but doesn't really know anything not a fraud yeah and then of course there's like other characters the character Nathan who's the little boy he is like a maker kind of like a makerspace and maybe like a modder as well of Minecraft and
6106669	6113281	and um I'm not sure who the the female character is or the the other two characters but um
6114315	6115196	We'll have to wait and see.
6115416	6118498	But it was neat to see all the behind-the-scenes stuff.
6118638	6121941	They have Weta working on the props and everything.
6121981	6122961	It looks really cool.
6124002	6128445	Up close, they're showing all the physical props in the movie.
6128465	6129726	It looked really, really cool.
6130187	6131467	So I'm kind of excited about it.
6131788	6132268	We'll see.
6132528	6138753	I think it still could be kind of dumb, but a little bit more confident since they are working with
6139193	6165516	you know Mojang and content creators that are really fans of Minecraft and just to make sure that they've got the right feeling for the movie so we'll see give it give it some you know chance um and then last thing was there's gonna be a live experience for Minecraft an interactive experience uh starting in Dallas called uh Minecraft Villager Rescue and it is like these interactive rooms that can go in and they have all these uh different videos projected onto the wall and you can kind of interact with them
6166096	6167657	in real life, so that's kind of cool.
6168317	6176122	Like I said, coming first to Dallas and then not sure if it's going to be coming to other locales later on, but maybe.
6176782	6178143	We'll have to wait and see.
6179204	6183206	Lots of stuff, but yeah, it's interesting.
6183306	6184387	I don't know.
6184607	6190190	The new biome and stuff is kind of alright, but we'll see what other stuff comes out a little bit later on.
6192271	6192591	Alright.
6192972	6194873	Exciting stuff ahead for Minecraft.
6196633	6211550	Let's move on and talk about a game that's excited a lot of people this weekend We have yet to talk about Zelda Echoes of Wisdom which just came out over this weekend I think it released Thursday night, Friday So I think some of you in chat have probably had a chance to play it Very curious what those of you in chat think about it
6212071	6215453	As we are taping live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6215793	6220816	But we're getting to hear a little bit about some of the development behind the scenes about this game, Zelda Echoes of Wisdom.
6221196	6230381	I actually had no idea about this, but did you know that the director for this game is Tomomi Sano, who would now be the first female director of a Zelda game?
6230441	6232863	I did not know that with this, so that's pretty cool.
6233683	6238166	And recently she did a Ask the Developer blog with, of course...
6238966	6246369	Anuma, the producer behind the game, and Grezzo, which I think is another studio that helped with this game, Satoshi Terada.
6247069	6253292	And they were talking a little bit about the development of the game and how originally in developing this game, Link was going to be the protagonist.
6254313	6263703	But in developing the game, it was realized that if Link still has a sword and shield, why would the echoes and the new concepts be something that was used?
6264164	6268409	And so in a quote, Tarada from Grezzo said...
6268889	6272052	Echoes plus a sword and shield, it just didn't work well together.
6272412	6277597	There's a wide variety of Echoes, so to get the most out of the gameplay, we decided to stick with Echoes only.
6278218	6285224	And so Anuma kind of tagging onto that said, if that's the case, it must be someone who doesn't fight with a sword and shield, right?
6285564	6289068	Who in the series would be a good fit for those powers and bring their insight to them?
6289388	6290989	Well, that would have to be Princess Zelda.
6292060	6293361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6310097	6313978	And they admit, you know, there's been that feedback over the years.
6314058	6315919	Will Princess Zelda ever be the protagonist?
6316279	6317860	I'd like to play as Princess Zelda.
6318540	6326642	And in response, Anuma said, when asked this question, I've always thought, of course, as long as it makes sense for the game and does justice to her as a character to be the protagonist.
6327362	6330624	I'd been trying in vain to figure out what would really do justice to her.
6330964	6338006	But when I saw the team struggling to identify the ideal protagonist for this game, I thought, this is exactly the game for her.
6338846	6340107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6354355	6359277	I don't think the timeline and all that stuff is that important to the game's success, and is it fun?
6359617	6363318	But it is interesting to hear about the types of things that they have to consider in making the game.
6363698	6365158	And so I'm excited to check out the game.
6365518	6367919	I still have a Nintendo voucher, and I plan to use it on this game.
6368879	6371520	Remember, you can get the two vouchers for that whole thing.
6371540	6372601	So I still have one, actually.
6372961	6374541	So I'm going to use it to get this.
6375121	6378662	Yeah, I picked it up, but my son's been playing it.
6378742	6379523	How's he been liking it?
6380763	6381683	I think he's been liking it.
6381703	6383364	He's been playing more Mario Kart than anything.
6384950	6385611	I think he likes it.
6385851	6388654	DJ Ranma S says, the game has a bit of a learning curve, but it's fun.
6389214	6392617	Dr. Sia says, I think Grezzo also did the Link's Awakening remake.
6392798	6398303	Yes, and that's why, quite frankly, they probably look very similar, that they're in a very similar engine.
6398623	6401185	So, there's a reason for that, but that's okay.
6401326	6401346	I...
6402407	6405571	I'm not bothered by that like that's how a lot of games used to be made.
6406212	6418829	Bobby was talking about this on his show tonight early on as he was talking about how they made a new Yakuza like a dragon game so fast, because they basically reused a lot of assets from the last game but guess what, that's how they used to make games.
6419850	6448452	that's it's as long as the story is good and a lot you know they can change enough to make it still feel like something really special and I think that's just fine I also take a look at Majora's Mask is basically a lot of the same shit as Ocarina of Time it doesn't matter it's still a great game on its own so you know that's that's okay I don't mind them I don't mind the fact it looks a lot like the Link's Awakening remake so I'll still check it out anyway let's go to you DarkSakra
6450249	6472135	well we are uh well people need to be held accountable especially companies that abuse their uh their assets that abuse uh their artists that work with them the League of Legends um the uh
6473985	6483392	They are in the middle of a dispute with the Hollywood Actors Union and an audio company that provides voiceover services for the game.
6485213	6500384	So SAG-AFTRA is involved in this one as a strike against League of Legends on Tuesday, saying that Formosa Interactive, the company, is trying to get around the ongoing video game strike by hiring non-union actors to work on another unrelated title.
6502505	6530343	and so yeah, they're like hey, we want some scabbies but it's bad enough I think that they are trying to they're wanting to refuse agreement about fair AI usage you know
6531428	6557795	but now they're trying to go behind everybody's uh everybody's uh back to try to do this in fact the quote is to commit illegal unfair labor practices is beyond the pale and won't be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members yeah don't do the don't do the scab work if you're an aspiring voice actor you'll be blacklisted you'll regret that don't do it you will totes be blacklisted um and on top of that you know um
6560517	6588233	people should have their body of work protected and not have their voice likeness be added to a database to just be used willy nilly it's like if I do graphic work for somebody it's only meant to be used for that purpose unless I have specifically licensed it for use of another purpose it's absolutely ridiculous and then on top of that now
6589326	6601412	There have been so many layoffs that companies are outsourcing like that to try to keep their workload up with the demand for product.
6604723	6618377	and other companies are seeing, you know, this behavior, this sort of going around behind the back as also a damage to their reputations and their ethics.
6619098	6627406	You know, there are risks for all companies because a few of them are doing this thing, you know, the bad apple analogy, right?
6630200	6653116	Riot Games is saying that they have nothing to do with the complaint but it's just that that specific aspect has been working with Formosa to they're basically saying that they're engaging with the union to try to resolve things and not
6655783	6657204	Go Behind Anyone's Back.
6657264	6660587	They said they never asked Formosa to cancel a game that they've registered.
6662129	6667914	SAG-AFTRA is saying that this is related to a non-riot game, so they don't really have anything to do with it.
6670905	6688182	but they're saying that members must immediately stop providing covered services to League of Legends and they are pretty stuck on this one Formosa is a union signatory on here so they are bound by this
6688863	6693006	I was going to say, this is a good reminder that the strike is still going on, too.
6693046	6695909	We haven't talked about it in a couple months, but it's still going on.
6696169	6705076	And there still has not been movement for the gaming companies to meet the actors at the table.
6705616	6710240	Which is interesting because something that happened... So we've been gone for two weeks because of TwitchCon and everything, right?
6711000	6732795	in that first week we were off I believe there's been a lot of AI stuff that got past legislation and like I know today something the governor vetoed about AI but I think that had to do with some type of like how the companies work but something that passed a couple weeks ago the governor signed was an it was a protecting Hollywood actors and performers from unauthorized AI and
6733075	6761646	Digital Clone Law so again California with this law is going to be you know and let's be real every media company has some type of presence in California so they're going to have to and other states will follow soon enough you know are going to have to follow this law so it's weird to me that this didn't end the strike right there like the studios are going to have to give on I realize there's other things they're still working on too but the studios have to give on this AI thing there is no choice now it is now being legislated
6762731	6790844	yep so I mean that's gonna they're gonna have to come to the table and honestly enough it really I think I think it's the strike that pushed the legislation it needed to happen and this is the second one over over this that I recall maybe third or definitely definitely at least there was one before this that they come to that resolution and then companies sort of went around it and did their business as usual anyway yeah
6792813	6794654	So it's going to be interesting to see what develops from this.
6794754	6797036	But yeah, don't do the scab work.
6797076	6797636	You'll regret it.
6798777	6799197	Yep.
6799917	6800217	All right.
6801438	6801939	Let's move on.
6801959	6803640	Just a couple more stories for you.
6803680	6808002	I wanted to go back real quick on a tangent regarding that last story.
6808282	6808482	Sure.
6808563	6813566	Have you guys seen any of the stuff from the new ChatGPT update with the voice?
6815226	6826731	I got a TikTok in my algorithm with a guy talking to the chat GPT thing going, I want you to talk to me like you're my gay best friend, my sister or something.
6826851	6833334	And like the voice, like it's so funny to hear saying these things, but it's just, it's ridiculous and silly.
6833374	6841617	Although the one I was seeing, there was one that they were getting, it was getting angry and it started cloning the person's voice when it was responding to them.
6843223	6845004	Like, it was, like, sounding like them.
6845304	6847226	And so, that's concerning.
6848046	6848627	Yeah, it is.
6853390	6853630	Anyways.
6856032	6857853	This is why that can all sit up.
6858774	6859695	It's one of those things where it's like...
6862955	6865216	It can sit over there in a box and I don't want to touch it.
6865276	6871599	But at the same time, on a professional level as a tool, we're going to have to touch it like it or not.
6871819	6875661	But those borders are going to have to get drawn fast.
6876701	6881223	And I've always been with the whole AI can be a tool for art.
6881743	6883464	AI is not a replacement for art.
6884731	6912954	and I think we see the legislation is starting to kind of fill in the gaps the same way but it's going to be interesting to see how that all shakes out but that's freaky be very careful what you it's actually a good lesson too and be careful the data you're giving those things to be quite honest read carefully what you are agreeing to when you use these types of things so anyway but read Rob that means people have to take personal responsibility
6914076	6914957	Who does that anymore?
6916319	6917260	I read about it in a book.
6917700	6922906	Or I had ChatGPT summarize a book for me that talked about it at some point.
6923046	6924848	Loki, what do you have next for us in gaming news?
6925822	6926963	Alright, this is kind of fun.
6927964	6936193	So you may remember like with Helldivers, there's the big old controversy about having the required PlayStation Network account in order to be able to play the game.
6936693	6943680	Well, now, God of War, Ragnarok, has the same issue on PC.
6944221	6948946	It does require you to have a PlayStation Network account, but I think if you're only playing like the
6949746	6950827	They're doing the Lord's work.
6967280	6992771	so they did put out the mod however they did take it down from Nexus Mods not because they were asked to but because they were worried that it was becoming so popular they were worried they were going to get a legal threat from Sony so they have taken it down but what's on the internet always on the internet so it's neat that they found a way to kind of get around that good job modders
6993584	7010085	we've done it again I think we all need to take a moment you need to thank your local modder take a minute, thank your local modder because, you know, and I was even talking about it earlier in the show with the retro achievements and all that stuff like, a lot of modders are really making this industry better
7010686	7012047	to be fair.
7012107	7012728	Not all of them.
7013028	7024316	And sometimes developers, though, sort of indirectly work with the modders, like the whole thing about the custom kit for Baldur's Gate 3, pretty much being left in there for someone to decode.
7024776	7028579	So I think this is a little bit different than Ghost of Tsushima, which did have a multiplayer mode.
7028599	7031441	I don't think, actually, God of War Ragnarok has a multiplayer mode.
7031461	7032442	I don't think Ragnarok does, no.
7033003	7035664	So it is a single-player online game, so... I...
7039375	7039855	I don't know.
7040016	7040956	I don't know why they do this.
7042597	7043998	I've seen... Was it screenshots?
7044379	7050523	I mean, I guess it's kind of typical with all these other logins and loaders and stuff like that where there was a screenshot.
7050563	7051924	It was on Reddit today, actually.
7052024	7052825	It was talking about...
7054520	7072331	one of the Tom Clancy games someone had purchased on Steam and the Ubisoft client was saying that they hadn't purchased the game and so they wouldn't let them play the game and they're like you have to contact customer service shouldn't have to do any of that because this launcher shouldn't exist but cool
7073297	7091907	well uh we're gonna get to the classic game of the week in a moment but we have a nice little segue here we need to go back to uh some games that they didn't connect to the internet they only connected to a television with a tube and a big fat butt via a coaxial cable uh that is of course the atari 2600
7093127	7093647	and friends.
7093908	7107694	And there was a collection not that long ago called Atari 50 that's pretty darn good and set the stage for Digital Eclipse's Gold Master Series that started with Karateka and Jeff Minter is going to continue with Tetris.
7108054	7120640	If you haven't checked out Atari 50, it's a pretty good time to revisit because the first DLC just dropped a few days ago called The Wider World of Atari which includes now 19 new playable games and
7120820	7122701	and 8 video segments.
7123161	7125622	So that is a new download content you can check out.
7125702	7129163	It is one of two DLCs that you're going to be able to check out.
7129683	7132944	The next DLC, which isn't dated yet, but it's going to... Oh, I'm sorry.
7132984	7133564	No, it is dated.
7133644	7134905	November 8th, actually.
7135225	7146569	So only a few more weeks before you get to do the first Console War, which is going to cover Atari versus Intellivision, which is really funny now because Atari owns Intellivision.
7147489	7149011	So that's going to be very interesting.
7149171	7152915	And a lot of people that were involved with Intellivision in the heyday, unfortunately, have passed away.
7153776	7156219	But I'm sure there's archival interviews and things that they will draw from.
7156619	7161425	But anyway, back to focusing on this first DLC, talking about the wider world of Atari.
7161965	7163087	You actually get some different...
7164588	7177734	videos including unusual and underappreciated innovations for the 2600, hidden gems for the 1980s, a spotlight on Evelyn Seto who created Atari's iconic logo.
7178655	7180436	I saw a thread on Blue Sky.
7180776	7184718	Apparently somebody from Digital Eclipse ran into her at some type of
7185598	7206390	launch or something for some type of industry meetup celebrating Atari and she was like yeah I made Atari's logo and it was like we should probably interview you and so they did and so it's in the DLC I think that's kind of funny um it also is apparently pretty community heavy talking about unreleased prototypes and the preservation of gaming history
7206755	7211960	and then archival and contemporary interviews from employees, fans and homebrew developers.
7212420	7213521	So that's pretty cool too.
7213681	7215022	I definitely want to check this out.
7215563	7219806	I checked out the original Atari 50 release, but I want to take the deep dive on the DLC.
7220167	7223209	I want to quickly tell you some of the games that are in the expansion.
7223229	7223770	Prototypes.
7224210	7237300	Yeah, Berserk for the 2600, the voice enhanced Berserk, which was a fan game, which that fan ended up being the CEO of Digital Eclipse, which Bobby had talked to me about on his show tonight, which I never knew.
7237360	7237980	That's really cool.
7238801	7239622	That is also on the 2600.
7240782	7249846	Berserk on the 5200, Berserk for the arcade, Frenzy, Red Baron, Skydiver, Avalanche, Destroyer, Superbug, Football, all for the arcade.
7250326	7255268	The Sears exclusives, Stellar Track, Submarine Commander, and Steeplechase.
7255308	7257169	I played Steeplechase all in the 2600.
7257649	7265532	And then Atari Video Cube, Desert Falcon, Off the Wall, Skydiver for the 2600, and Avalanche for Atari 8-bit.
7265612	7266413	So check that out.
7266913	7268413	$7.99 is the price for that. $7.99.
7270285	7270585	Not bad.
7271325	7275006	So props, props to the game preservation efforts on that.
7275146	7276067	I think that's really cool.
7276127	7278807	They're literally building a virtual museum and I think it's so cool to see.
7278887	7279528	So props to them.
7280068	7280328	All right.
7280828	7286770	Well, we've been building a virtual museum of our own with this segment through DarkSakura each and every week.
7286850	7287570	So let's roll the bumper.
7298283	7305587	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
7306027	7308569	It's time for the classic game of the week.
7310276	7311197	I picked Wing Commander.
7332185	7335846	The very first Wing Commander in the series.
7336767	7343329	It is a spaceflight simulation franchise by Origin Systems.
7343429	7347711	It was first released for MS-DOS on September 26, 1990 and had ports to Amiga, CD32, Sega CD...
7355534	7369632	the Super Nintendo and then a re-release as Wing Commander 1 in 1994 for PC and enhanced remake Super Wing Commander for the 3DO in 1994 that was also later ported to the Mac
7371688	7390264	their expansion missions there was Wing Commander The Secret Missions November 1990 and Wing Commander The Secret Missions 2 Crusade in March 1991 this was like the real big push that that genre needed it was considered a
7390704	7395506	One of the best space dogfight games.
7395606	7401729	It had great graphics, audio, a story campaign that people would often compare to Star Wars.
7402929	7406771	People were even referring to it as World War II in space.
7408851	7413293	It had a massive cast.
7413313	7417335	You had your multinational cast of pilots for the Terran Confederation.
7418195	7441100	you had uh you know your aliens that you're against the Kelrathi which were a feline race um but yeah um as I said it is a space flight simulation game where you pilot a ship and complete missions you engage enemy ships uh you know various strengths and weaknesses and uh they're
7442240	7445901	You have an AI-controlled wingman that you can give orders to.
7447161	7455484	Your missions will have different objectives, but you can proceed even if you fail, just as long as you live.
7457404	7464186	It has a branching, open-ended story, you get promotions and rank, you progress, you get better ships.
7465606	7470588	Although, if you fail objectives, you'll get more difficult missions and inferior ships.
7472068	7498864	you have a losing path that can work back to the winning path or you can fall off the winning path and go to the losing path and your wingmen can be killed permanently in combat and be gone the rest of the campaign and with the secret missions they don't have branching open-ended paths and you have to successfully complete the core missions of that game so you are
7500239	7510685	In the first game, you are a nameless pilot, although in the sequels, they're referred to as Christopher Blair fighting on the TCS Tiger's Claw.
7511925	7516208	And you name your pilot, you choose your call sign.
7516748	7516848	Um...
7518779	7546235	and in the in-production I can't make words happen the pilot who is known to the origin personnel as Blue Hair just goes up through the ranks and then you get all kinds of stuff happen I don't really want to go too much into the overall story but you do have two endings with the winning path considered to be the canon path by the game expansion packs and lead into Wing Commander 2 Vengeance of the Calrathi
7549913	7557377	So with the secret missions, you go through the Goddard system where you have a distress call.
7558478	7564842	And when you arrive, the colony that you're trying to rescue is nothing but, you know, a mess, all dead, blah, blah.
7566061	7570926	and you have to go against a Gravitron weapon and we'll keep going back from there.
7572528	7577674	More special secret stuff going in on the secret missions to Crusade.
7579857	7580558	You have...
7582748	7595285	Missing characters that you need to figure out what happened to them and also like a life sacrifice religious festival that you need to break up or something.
7597651	7625274	and then going even further than that one of my favorite writers Mercedes Lackey along with Ellen Guion did the first Wing Commander novel which was Wing Commander Freedom Flight and that's pretty cool I've been reading Mercedes Lackey for years and then let's not forget there was Super Wing Commander which was a big push on that as
7629370	7638215	It was from the mission that led the Tiger's Claw to track down the shipyards that were responsible for creating the Seaver Dreadnought.
7638235	7641737	You have different elements going in and it really pushes the story a bit further.
7643218	7648621	And it got four stars out of five for the 3DO that said that it was what it was intended to be.
7649262	7651843	A straightforward space simulator with an arcade spin.
7652904	7653384	Hey-hoo!
7654451	7654831	Excuse me.
7655772	7658755	So anyway, it was just a sneeze.
7660036	7670825	But it was originally called Squadron and later renamed to Wing Leader and then eventually they said that there would be...
7674060	7680103	The EM386 memory manager the game used would give an exception when a user exited the game.
7680584	7701957	It would print out a message similar to EM386 memory manager error with additional information and then someone Ken Demarest Hex edited the memory manager so it sent a different message and so the error message said thank you for playing Wing Commander and basically they
7702617	7708883	were able to remove the workaround once they fixed the problem, but Wing Commander is the title.
7710164	7712546	It was shipped in 1990 for PC DOS.
7713227	7717390	It had an instruction booklet that looked like a shipboard magazine called Clawmarks.
7720277	7745911	it had uh just all kinds of neat stuff in it um you could get the mission packs like the secret missions like I was mentioning before and like I said there were lots of ports we had the SNES we had Amiga we had Amiga CD 32 the Sega CD 1994 a Mega Drive version was intended to use the the ACIC graphics chip but never was released um
7747112	7755855	Wing Commander was retroactively renamed Wing Commander 1 as a bundle with Wing Commander 2 in preparation for the release of Wing Commander 3, Heart of the Tiger.
7755895	7759356	Wasn't Wing Commander 3 the one that had Mark Hamill in it?
7759376	7760136	It sure was.
7760996	7761576	Yep, it was.
7763977	7777281	and then we had a later port to Windows 95 again re-released with Wing Commander 2 and Wing Commander 3, Heart of the Tiger which was all known as Wing Commander, the Karathi Saga
7780296	7803270	the secret missions um all all reported and the secret mission add-ons uh are they were all available you actually apparently you can download them from Origin's website I think is how that went um Super Wing Commander came out on 3DO and Mac it was like I said a pretty enhanced and exceptional version of the game and then um
7805385	7834012	it was basically the game that really rose the bar for a genre and it established sort of an action shooter genre as a viable contender EA ported the SNES version to PS Portable as a part of EA Replay this is in 2006 and then in August 2011 the Wing Commander PC version was re-released onto GOG
7835012	7849299	the lost source code for Wing Commander was given to the fan community that year by a former developer to preserve the game that's awesome it had been
7851623	7855506	It's contemporaries it was competing with was LucasArts X-Wing.
7856266	7862731	Dragon Magazine even rated the game, giving it a 6 out of 5 stars, which I think is funny.
7865053	7875140	But yeah, this game, like some of its awards, it won the 1991 Game of the Year from Computer Gaming World and also the Hall of Fame.
7875960	7896487	and the 7 best PC games of all time and the 15 best ways to die all by the same publication Time gave it the title of one of the 100 best video games of all time PC Format said 50 best computer games of all time and PC Gamer US number 23 best game of all time
7897707	7908873	and the Sega CD version got a pretty great review from GamePro back in the day for having great digitized speech and pretty decent cinematic animation.
7909133	7911215	They said it gave them the feel of a space opera.
7913296	7920740	So without going too much into a lot more on that one, as for how it sold by February 1995, it had sold around 290,000 copies.
7926720	7947976	and this was considered to be one of the first examples of a game referred to as interactive cinema and there you go Wing Commander we just need to take a moment to really explain how important this game was in gaming's history especially on the PC front um
7949213	7975047	it was really fucking important there you go this game was huge there's so much of my youth many hours that I lost to this game and the several sequels you talked about there even watching this footage now has taken me way back as it is many of the people in chat it's pretty incredible great pick but maybe I'm a little biased Wing Commander love it
7976121	7977922	Rocky Horror Picture Show Video Game Coming Out
8004980	8007160	from Freak Zone Games.
8007300	8010261	It is a retro style action platformer.
8010361	8011621	Ordering right now.
8011701	8016102	Sorry, I'm going to be very nitpicky on one point just as somebody who is a huge fan of this stuff.
8016622	8021243	It is a Rocky Horror Show adaptation, not picture show.
8021303	8025304	And the reason why I make that distinction is because the Rocky Horror Show was the play.
8025684	8025884	Yes.
8026464	8031285	And the Rocky Horror Show also had that original
8031445	8033866	That awesome song that they took out in the movie.
8034246	8036627	Well, it does bring the movie down a little bit.
8036707	8038908	But it's so good.
8039689	8040309	It's fine.
8040429	8046652	We actually digitally reinserted it back into the movie and it really does kill the inertia of the second half of the movie.
8046672	8047552	So I understand why they cut it.
8047952	8054555	But anyway, there actually was a really bad game on the Commodore 64 and Apple II that was also Rocky Horror Show.
8054655	8056376	So to see it coming back is actually pretty rad.
8056756	8060698	I'm going to sneak through just a little bit of the chiptune time warp because it's so good.
8066513	8066833	There you go.
8066913	8067573	It's just so good.
8067693	8068054	I like it.
8068134	8068374	I love it.
8068414	8070755	I can't wait to hear the songs chiptuned.
8071075	8080638	Anyway, sorry, Loki, but you know I have... The company that's putting it out has been known for making kind of these obscure cult movie-based games.
8080718	8084160	So they did Manos, the Hands of Fate, which was a 2D platformer as well.
8084580	8087141	They've also done the Angry Video Game.
8087161	8087781	I need that.
8088201	8091684	Adventure, and its sequel as well.
8092205	8094767	So yeah, it looks pretty good.
8095007	8098070	It's similar to like a Castlevania or Mega Man style game.
8098270	8099451	So looking forward to it.
8099631	8102273	I need to get this Manos Hands of Fate one right now.
8102313	8104095	That's like the best MST3K.
8105356	8108899	It was the one episode where they apologized for making him watch the movie.
8110908	8121494	And then we have a game that is in development right now that's launched a Kickstarter campaign called This Is Fine, Maximum Cope.
8121554	8126216	It's the classic meme with the dog sitting in the burning room.
8128396	8150610	it looks silly and yeah that's supposed to be they're working on getting that put out they said that it's eventually launching targeting March 2026 and available on PlayStation 5 Nintendo Switch and Steam although by then who knows what platforms Nintendo Switch is that even going to be a thing in 2026 I don't know
8154615	8159122	But they're trying to reach a goal of 50,000, which I think they probably will.
8160964	8161905	All right, DarkSakura.
8163888	8166392	I'm sorry, I was mesmerized by Manos, the Hands of Fate.
8169856	8170918	At least it's not Deathbed.
8172179	8185807	So anyway, for Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, or Garou Densetsu, the DLC characters coming up for that for Season Pass 1 is Ken and Chun-Li from Street Fighter.
8187108	8191391	Ken is launching Summer of 2025 with Chun-Li coming in the winter.
8192011	8193212	So, there you go.
8193712	8197054	Can they fucking stop teasing us and just give us Capcom SNK 3?
8197775	8198175	Come on.
8198355	8198615	Please.
8198695	8199095	Come on.
8199115	8199335	Please.
8199976	8200496	Like, enough.
8200516	8200656	Please.
8201437	8201677	Please.
8203407	8204307	But no, this is great news.
8204347	8204928	I'm happy to hear it.
8205608	8205908	Alright.
8208249	8213392	Also, hey, if you are a fan of Tetris, I'm sure you've heard of Tetris the Grandmaster.
8213492	8215973	To many, it's like the definitive version of Tetris.
8216273	8217414	Maybe next to the NES.
8218174	8224297	Many people consider the Nintendo... I want to say the NES original, but technically that was the... Many people consider the Nintendo-branded
8224777	8225838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8244209	8270243	but then guess what they announced yep it's Tetris the Grandmaster series coming in 2025 so we'll be in the first three months next year the game is designed to help train you into the ultimate Tetris Pro that's all they said no screenshots no nothing yet but come on bitches it's Tetris like you know what to expect and all you need to know is it's another in the Grandmaster series I'm sure that is enough to get you excited about that so please look forward to it early next year
8271548	8274110	DarkTutsuya in chat says, love me some Grandmaster.
8274470	8276352	I have the two on Arcade Archives.
8276432	8277933	It's really my favorite spinoff.
8278353	8280055	Yeah, I keep forgetting it's on Arcade Archives.
8280095	8281115	I need to pick it up myself.
8282276	8284178	We love a good run of Tetris.
8284658	8285419	It's always fun.
8286039	8290443	All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner than the next Grandmaster game.
8291163	8292004	World release dates.
8292064	8293485	Loki, what's coming out this week in the US?

8458721	8461404	How about Sword Art Online, Fractured Daydream?

8482345	8483445	DarkSakura, how about Europe?
8510518	8513599	So what we have, I like trying to remember what today is, oh my goodness.

8543554	8549237	All right, we have just a few more stories for you and then we'll see if we get any quick questions or things for Listener Roundtable tonight.
8549577	8551759	But let's go over to Loki.
8553075	8553435	Alright.
8554856	8568041	So, Twitch is removing one of the most famous emotes that's on the platform right now, the Bible Thump, which is, of course, from the game The Binding of Isaac.
8568641	8569682	Now, it's un...
8571142	8577466	They posted out on Twitter saying that, you know, the end of the Bible Thump era is nigh.
8578406	8582608	And it says, on September 30th, our rights to our beloved emote expire.
8582869	8586050	And while this is sad news, we know all emotes go to heaven.
8586110	8590653	Speaking of sad, we're going to need a new emote to spam these feelings.
8591193	8591593	However...
8595766	8598129	A lot of people point out, it's like, oh, it's terrible news.
8598289	8602014	A small indie company can't afford licensing fees for a single emote.
8604116	8605098	And what's funny is actually...
8607401	8621028	You know, from that, it says for those wondering what happened with the Bible Thumb emote, I'm 100% fine with coming up with a good solution to keep or modify the emote, but I'm not in control of the new Twitch policy, so it's really up to them.
8621608	8628011	That's the lead developer who, of course, shipped Super Meat Boy and the game.
8628031	8635295	It says he still owns the rights to the image and would be 100% fine with Twitch renewing them at seemingly little or no cost.
8636796	8636976	But
8637555	8666103	they're not going to pay anything I guess for it well I kind of came to the same conclusion that Bobby is apparently officially reporting in chat right now saying Twitch policy is to no longer pay for rights for emotes because they don't have enough money to do so anymore so they're going to let all of their licensed emotes expire they can't pay their staff they're having to cut costs and cut quarters with all that stuff so I'm kind of not surprised to hear that they're cutting the emote to be quite honest
8668049	8669930	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8690771	8693952	They did that also in Rotterdam as well.
8694533	8701275	You're telling me that they couldn't scrape up a few thousand dollars from those events?
8701695	8703196	Maybe they needed a donation bin.
8703256	8706457	Save the Bible Thumb emote.
8706557	8710959	I have a hard time believing that they can't scrape up that amount of money.
8712259	8713480	Twitch should do a marathon.
8714636	8720383	They do all these exclusive parties and stuff like that for their partners and stuff.
8720904	8724669	Maybe throw one less party and then you can afford your meme...
8727839	8729520	Emote, but whatever.
8729720	8731381	And Bobby has another comment in chat.
8731441	8741387	And again, it's the very, like, it's the corporate line that makes sense on paper that says, I think it's more policy from on high to not pay anybody for emotes.
8741508	8745310	I bet the Twitch rank and file would love to license it, but Big Daddy Amazon says no.
8745770	8746190	You're right.
8746431	8747711	It's probably the policy.
8748012	8749212	That's just the policy.
8750233	8752414	But I can still sit here and say the policy sucks.
8752775	8754636	You know.
8756332	8758093	Not that many people would subscribe.
8758153	8758454	I don't know.
8779784	8780104	Anyway.
8780924	8781264	All right.
8782005	8788767	Well, somebody I think many of you are subscribed to on YouTube, and you're probably sad to see her say, I'm done.
8789267	8789847	I'm quitting.
8790307	8791007	I'm retiring.
8791667	8796409	But the Skyrim grandma, or Shirley Curry, is retiring.
8796449	8796929	That's right.
8797429	8803971	She started when she was just 79 years old, but now she is...
8805885	8806726	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8822006	8830569	It seems that I spent most of my time sitting here at this computer and lately, probably for the last month, I walk in here and look at my computer and think, I've got to make a video today.
8830949	8833810	And then I just shake my head at myself and say, I don't want to.
8834170	8835370	I have no desire to.
8836251	8839532	I'm old and I'm tired and I don't feel like doing much anymore.
8840152	8841232	I'm just doing it for fun.
8841252	8841512	Okay.
8841632	8842253	And it's not funny.
8842293	8845514	Yeah, like, honestly, all her reasons are legit.
8845814	8846094	Like...
8848767	8858636	I get that she wants to go live her life and there is a very distinct possibility that Elder Scrolls 6 may not come out in time, if you know what I mean.
8859416	8862139	It's a little morbid, but yeah.
8862199	8862819	It is what it is.
8863620	8866042	But she can go out and enjoy her life and make the most of it.
8867464	8869826	Spend some of that money you've been earning on YouTube.
8870406	8871727	Take yourself on a nice cruise.
8872428	8873169	Have fun with it.
8873849	8874490	Do what you want.
8875919	8878081	She also has a surgery coming up, to be fair.
8878181	8878862	So you know what?
8879482	8882485	She's given you all this content and all this stuff to listen to over the years.
8882705	8883186	Enjoy it.
8884367	8886789	S2100Matt says, I feel like that at 40.
8887630	8891313	S2100Matt also quips, she's bowing out of the race and endorsing Kamala.
8891393	8895437	Well, good for her, because there's really only two choices at this point.
8896998	8900141	And I don't think I have to tell you that that would be the same decision I would make as well.
8902165	8902465	All right.
8903006	8908272	Well, let's move to the listener roundtable where we invite you to participate with our show.
8908592	8911215	If you have some questions in our chat, we'd be happy to field them.
8911235	8915379	We're running a little long tonight, so I don't know if we want to do a ton of calls, but maybe we can sneak in.
8915399	8916020	There's no email.
8916100	8916921	There's no email?
8917381	8919143	Y'all had two weeks and no emails?
8920174	8920994	I am disappointed.
8921534	8927857	Participate at OrangeSongsRadio.com especially if you have a picture where you're booping Dark Sakura in her pig cosplay.
8927897	8935559	I want that picture sent to participate at OrangeSongsRadio.com because I need to see this.
8936019	8936819	So please send that in.
8936879	8938360	Or just say hello.
8938520	8941781	Let us know your thoughts on the new Zelda game or what you're playing these days.
8942241	8944062	Or if you're just discovering
8944742	8945162	Tell me why
8967612	8969833	So it's going to be stuck in my head again, Rob.
8969853	8970873	Thank you.
8972594	8992000	I saw, what was it, that the guy that was kind of responsible for dumping a lot of those arcade games, the Bomani stuff, like on Twitter and stuff, he's managed to modify the dump and modify the DDR mini machine to put other mixes.
8992020	8994121	Which I've heard is kind of a dumpster fire.
8994321	8994941	Sorry.
8995041	8996802	It sounds like it's really missing a lot of stuff.
8997699	9023162	yeah well they it has it apparently it has all those songs still on there they just disabled them so it has like the music and stuff so the modders are oh oh my god the modders are already done re-enabling them because i think i think he's found a way to like well to essentially like to um to dump a new image on there too to unlock that stuff again so be interesting to see what happens with that
9023982	9031003	interesting, OrangeRite says you can still play them, the machine just mutes them and puts a message on the screen what?
9031404	9049387	that's even worse that's so funny anyway DarkSakura, just be glad you know what, I'm in my third mix and my fifth mix era, just be glad I didn't go to fourth mix yet, but maybe in the next week because DarkSakura, if I go to fourth mix 1, 2, 3 4, 0, 0, 7 no, no
9057292	9084194	tell me do you know about the seven the seven tell me do you know about the seven I seriously at my funeral when you lower my casket play the seven jump just do it just do it as we drop your corpse into a fire just do it and then the seven boom
9086038	9086298	Dump.
9086458	9086758	Dump.
9086778	9086938	Dump.
9087038	9087138	Dump.
9087158	9087799	Dump.
9088139	9088799	Dump.
9089099	9089239	Dump.
9089299	9089419	Dump.
9089479	9089599	Dump.
9089799	9089939	Dump.
9089959	9090520	Dump.
9116808	9118309	I can't stand it.
9118369	9119009	That one, right?
9119470	9121050	And then it had extra mix.
9121110	9128533	Not only had the fourth mix plus stuff, so like Cat's Eye and Conga Feelin' and all that shit, but then it had all the bass mix.
9129213	9135456	The Baby Mama and the Hysteria and all the booty mix songs from the bass.
9135476	9136176	You know what's funny?
9136516	9136717	What?
9137677	9140218	I've actually been going back and watching the episodes of Cat's Eye.
9141127	9141707	Oh, have you really?
9141887	9142368	That's funny.
9142568	9144469	Yeah, it's a great anime.
9144749	9148431	And I didn't know at the time it's actually associated with the City Hunter universe.
9149171	9149792	Oh my god.
9150552	9154734	Like the characters appear in like some of the City Hunter movies and stuff.
9154774	9156115	It's actually kind of interesting.
9156735	9158776	And I like it's a really good show.
9158877	9163139	It's about like three lady thieves trying to steal back their own stuff.
9164561	9167602	I'm screaming because Orange Rite is throwing it way back in chat.
9167642	9175665	So Mike Deft said, And then Orange Rite followed that up with, We had a bumper around that.
9175845	9178446	Bitch, get a new song.
9178966	9179666	Exactly.
9179766	9182347	He's throwing it back to that old bumper.
9185728	9187689	We need to remake those bumpers.
9187809	9188269	No, we don't.
9189109	9189670	No, we do.
9189690	9190830	No, we do.
9193823	9197564	Oh my god, my ex-boyfriend was the voice in a lot of those bumpers.
9199705	9200885	Throwing it way back.
9200985	9202386	I haven't heard from him in years.
9202426	9209108	I don't even know where... I tried looking for... Remember the days of putting in your voice and then lowering the pitch to sound different?
9209168	9210168	Yeah, yeah.
9210449	9212929	That's a thing that happened for a long time.
9212989	9216511	That's... I shudder.
9216951	9217371	I shudder.
9218763	9220324	We have so many better times now.
9220504	9221725	I don't apologize for it.
9221785	9225007	We did what we had to do at the time for dial-up friendly radio.
9225548	9226168	It is what it is.
9227169	9227489	Alright.
9229050	9230932	Okay, enough reminiscing down memory lane.
9231312	9235555	Let me check with Loki if there's any current last-minute stories to talk about tonight.
9236436	9237376	I don't have anything.
9237456	9242280	Yeah, I think we covered out all the big stuff, so that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio tonight.
9242320	9246343	Thank you, as always, for listening to our show, whether this was your first show or your
9247401	9250324	DarkSakura, you're off to stream tonight, yes?
9273763	9277327	Yeah, and apparently Instacart didn't deliver my sodas.
9277727	9278909	So I have to go yell.
9279449	9280751	Have you had the Oreo soda?
9281251	9281992	Yes, I have.
9282032	9283594	That's what I had ordered more of.
9283694	9284515	We can't find it.
9284555	9285436	We had it once.
9285616	9286317	It's fucking delicious.
9286337	9287298	Just go to Walmart.
9287518	9288499	No, I went to Walmart.
9288519	9289140	They didn't have it.
9290242	9293163	I need to figure out what the fuck is going on with Instacart.
9293303	9295324	I set foot at a Walmart, Jamie.
9295584	9299886	I hate going to Walmart and I set foot in a Walmart to try to find Oreo Coke.
9300486	9301427	And you know what I found?
9301487	9302507	Coke flavored Oreos.
9302527	9303368	You know what I didn't find?
9303468	9304308	Oreo flavored Coke.
9306646	9307287	Here's the thing.
9307407	9308347	Missing items.
9308948	9313470	Oreo Coke isn't necessarily that great, but... I ordered my soda.
9313590	9315572	Why isn't my soda showing on the damn thing?
9315872	9316572	Here's the thing.
9317313	9323036	It really is just vanilla Coke with an extra little kick, and that's all I need.
9323076	9327819	Yeah, it's really good, and I'm really pissed that they didn't deliver... The fact that it's in a zero flavor is perfect.
9327879	9328319	My God.
9328539	9328819	Anyway.
9329680	9331261	Now I want to know what happened to my damn order now.
9331881	9332181	Get them.
9332241	9332762	I'm pissed.
9332922	9333242	Get them.
9333582	9333982	Yeah.
9334583	9334823	All right.
9336119	9339003	Uh, yes, sorry, PodCulture, it is Oreo Coke Zero.
9339043	9339564	That's all I drink.
9339644	9344931	I, you know, ever since the Dabudis, that's all I drink now is Zero and Diet and all that stuff, so.
9345391	9352941	And I don't drink, that's not what I drink, because I always say that, and without fail, somebody will come in and say, you know, diet drinks are bad for you.
9353161	9353582	I don't
9354523	9356384	I don't inject them into my veins.
9356564	9358365	I don't have it all day, every day.
9358445	9360106	I don't go through a two liter every day.
9360626	9362827	I enjoy the occasional soda with dinner.
9363267	9364248	I think that's acceptable.
9364688	9365048	Thank you.
9365649	9365869	Anyway.
9365969	9368630	I couldn't find them, but I didn't get my stuff.
9368650	9369571	No, they're a fever dream.
9369591	9370591	They don't exist anymore.
9372972	9374193	I drank the shit out of them.
9375714	9376014	All right.
9377274	9378475	So what are you streaming tonight?
9379973	9381133	Oh, you are doing DBD.
9381394	9383314	I wasn't sure if you were doing Palia or something else tonight.
9383334	9384475	Okay, DBD tonight.
9384675	9386415	There's a big blood hunt going on anyway, isn't there?
9386695	9387216	I think there is.
9387396	9388156	Chaos Shuffle.
9388236	9389376	Chaos Shuffle is always fun.
9389576	9391897	So, check that out.
9392077	9394118	I'm just really, really irritated.
9394298	9397499	Alright, well, do you want to spread some of that irritation in your final thought tonight?
9398560	9399460	Oh, hell yeah.
9400720	9402161	I'm gonna let them have it.
9402641	9403161	Let them have it.
9404422	9405462	Alright, have a good stream, DarkSakura.
9406440	9407001	You too.
9407081	9407341	Bye.
9408122	9409022	Wait, but not a stream.
9409042	9409603	I'm not streaming.
9409623	9410464	Well, I'll stream tomorrow.
9410604	9411404	I'll have a good stream tomorrow.
9412785	9413126	Bye.
9413246	9413466	Okay.
9414027	9414327	Bye.
9415188	9418971	Loki, then that takes us to you and your final thought tonight.
9419091	9421433	Final thought is I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
9423012	9423472	Ah, mood.
9423592	9424893	This weekend wasn't long enough.
9425013	9427915	Like, you know, I enjoy my job and all, but it's just one of those, like, ah.
9428655	9434098	And I just had a fucking vacation last weekend, and I'm already, like, I just want to sleep for, like, a whole day.
9434698	9435578	I just have a day in bed.
9435598	9436839	I want a horizontal day.
9436979	9437239	Oh, well.
9438420	9438740	Let's see.
9438780	9443122	My final thought is, yeah, thank you, modders.
9443623	9447345	Thank you, modders, for everything you've done for the community, and you've done an awful lot.
9447385	9451667	We salute you here on September 29th, officially Modders Day.
9452771	9453591	I do declare.
9454772	9456092	Thank you for saving our industry.
9456432	9457653	Have a good week, everybody.
9457673	9458933	We'll see you next time in seven days.
9458973	9460053	We'll do it all over again.
9460534	9461234	Good night.
9482083	9484046	But you know they were all still true.
9484126	9484767	See you next week.
