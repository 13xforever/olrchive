9686	17069	Here we are, video game console generation 9, the generation of streaming to and from everywhere, subscription services, and now, quadruple-A games.
17069	26473	That's right, Ubisoft's Skull & Bones' Rise from the Ashes has been so successful, it will be the first quadruple-A game, and will clearly become a tentpole in Ubisoft's lineup.
26473	28774	This is part of Yves Guillemot's decree.
28774	36457	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this, and more of two weeks of gaming news, starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has voice.
39246	41989	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41989	46214	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46214	56787	It is Orange Lounge Radio and a special shout out to our voiceover guy Jason who does those intros for us every single week and just dropped 4000 bits in the chat.
58769	59790	That's a lot of bits.
59790	60770	Thank you so much, Jason.
60770	77760	Thank you to everybody who's getting that hype train going because we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network, usually right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, but Bobby Blackwolf has the night off for another social engagement, but we're all here.
77760	83784	I am Rob Roberts, of course, and my pals that join me every week, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
85054	86915	I hope both teams lose.
86915	88175	I hope Taylor Swift wins.
88175	90616	I think I'm sure everybody's making that joke.
90616	93077	But you know, that's that's that's where I'm at.
93077	96559	Yeah, I could not give two shits about her.
96559	100600	Um, what was I gonna say?
100600	102361	Here's here's what I really wanted to say.
102361	106863	You and I had a very lovely I don't want to say anti Super Bowl brunch but very lovely.
108283	109123	Peaceful.
109123	110444	We had a superb owl.
110444	113465	We had a peaceful alternative this morning.
113465	115826	We had a brunch and that was very lovely.
115826	118807	We, we, we had a superb owl brunch.
118807	119147	That's right.
119147	119647	We sure did.
119647	120488	We ate owl.
120488	122788	In a place with no TVs.
122788	123028	Yes.
123028	126830	I thought that was a great idea to find a place with no TVs and have brunch there.
126830	127630	It was, it was great.
127630	132912	The only thing that would have made it better would have been drag brunch, but all the drag brunch places have TVs.
132912	134793	So, you know, it is what it is.
135760	150744	I only just wish that I had brought something for my tummy, but otherwise I think we had a delightful breakfast, brunch, lunch, foodage, and shopping at the glamorous Joanne's.
150744	153625	Yeah, here's the part DarkSakura maybe doesn't want to tell you, but
155005	159748	Mommy got wine drunk, or mimosa drunk in this case.
159748	161789	Hibiscus drunk.
161789	173075	Needed a little escort over to Joanne's to walk around a little bit and work off some of that cranberry hibiscus champagne.
173075	174676	That was a nice Prosecco.
174676	175056	It was good.
176957	184863	No, and I've I've I've made no secret of this that ever since gastric bypass, like if I have any alcohol, I'm like insta drunk.
184863	185544	Yeah.
185544	190368	One thing that people don't know is if it's hard liquor, I sober up really quickly.
190368	196813	If it is something bubbly like a champagne or even some wines.
196813	202577	No, it's going to last because those bubbles are going to revitalize the alcohol in my system.
202577	204859	I think that's that's my theory and I'm sticking to it.
205783	207664	I also have a low alcohol tolerance.
207664	210845	I have not had the same procedure you have, but I've noticed it ever since.
210845	213346	Well, I've always been lightweight, like even in college.
213346	221989	But I had my gallbladder taken out a few years, about 10 years, no longer than that shit, probably like 15 years ago, actually, at this point.
221989	225371	And when that came out, like my alcohol tolerance dropped significantly.
225371	226751	I don't know what the correlation is.
226751	228532	But yeah, it's been kind of interesting.
229995	236260	The thing is that the gallbladder is not, you know, a useless part of the body.
236260	238242	It does a lot to regulate your digestion.
238242	239303	Yeah.
239303	243547	So without it, you know, your your digestion is going to suffer.
244226	246689	But that is why I did not consume mimosa.
246689	250653	I stuck with my poison of choice, coffee.
250653	252035	I had coffee too.
252035	255218	That probably helped or hindered.
255218	259723	Anyway, let's say hello to somebody unfortunately I didn't have brunch with today, but maybe in the future.
259723	261885	Let's say hello to Techmaster Loki.
261885	262326	Hello.
262326	262766	Hi, Loki.
262766	263087	How are you?
264226	280113	Good, um, sorry for the delay in the punchline for the joke, uh, for the Ubisoft, uh, quadruple A. Um, the extra A stands for abuse, as in the unaddressed abuses by Ubisoft in their, uh, uppermentionment.
280413	283915	I was laughing because I thought you meant like financial or wallet abuse.
283915	286236	I didn't think you were going to the dark place with that.
286236	287597	So all right.
287597	288978	Okay, yikes.
288978	290579	All right, well, we'll get to that story.
290579	291759	And much more later on.
291759	297082	Actually, first, what I want to address, I want to address something that you know, came up or didn't come up as the case may be.
297082	298783	We did not have a show last week.
298783	300104	And this was unexpected.
300484	305525	And it's really funny because some people told me that morning like, hey, you didn't have a new show on the feed.
305525	306205	Is everything all right?
306205	308006	And it's like, no, here's what happened.
308006	315428	So for those that weren't aware, because it was a week ago now at this point, but California had some pretty gnarly storms for California.
315428	321809	I always have to quantify it with that because people on the East Coast see the rain totals here and they're like, that's nothing.
321809	323670	Remember, we're built a little differently.
323670	326230	We're built to tolerate earthquakes, but not hurricanes.
326230	329471	So everything here is plywood and mud.
329471	329591	Yeah.
330111	335173	So the storms, unfortunately, we had a show ready to go.
335173	345257	Everything was set up and the power went out at my place around 3.30 and it did not come back up until, here's the funny thing, 6.10.
345257	347918	So 10 minutes after Bobby's show ends,
348778	351840	And we should have been on, the power comes back on.
351840	357123	But punchline to the punchline, it went out again nine minutes later.
357123	361646	So even if we had like tried like I've been like, oh, rally the troops, let's go live.
361646	364208	It would by the time we actually went live, it would have gone off again.
364208	367350	And it didn't come back until God probably like 10 o'clock at night.
367350	370672	So it was it was pretty late when it came back on.
370672	371633	You know, it's funny.
374278	382044	I had the migraine to end all migraines, but Dan went out to get me food from The Habit.
391571	400415	And, um, I'm wearing flannel by the way, chat, just to say hello to our chat, um, who's discussing about rednecks and wearing flannel.
400415	414282	Anyway, um, my, uh, my neighborhood, according to Dan, as he left our neighborhood, the entire neighborhood was, had no power except for my, my block.
415089	415590	Lucky You!
430249	430850	All around
454524	468471	I had just tweeted, I put out a thing that said, hey, I hope you all will join us for our 1000th episode that's going to be on April 7th, I think was the original projected date.
468471	470111	And what guests do you want to see?
470111	474994	You know, just some type of tweet to just make people aware, hey, we're hitting a really huge landmark in early April.
475854	480275	and just just to be clear, we're talking behind the scenes about what kind of special thing we do.
480275	482156	Don't expect anything big.
482156	487617	We're not going to I'm not seeking a big name to come on the show or anything like that.
487617	490898	Maybe some blast from the past and our little family and so forth.
490898	491819	That would be delightful.
491819	496140	But I'm not trying to aim for getting Reggie Fils-Aim√© or something.
496440	501442	Um, I really enjoyed how we did the 20th anniversary show where we really made it a celebration of us.
501442	503683	Uh, and I, I think that will be great.
503683	516309	Um, so we, there's some ideas out there and I think y'all will enjoy what we end up cooking up for episode 1000, which will now be April 14th because I had the audacity to tweet that our thousandth episode will be April 7th.
516309	519911	So God said, I'll show you bitch and pulled the plug.
519911	521191	So now we're delayed.
522612	526896	The more conservative version of that is man plans, God laughs.
526896	527957	Exactly.
527957	539347	So but we really can't delay that another week because unfortunately, if you get into April 21st, now we're at DarkSakura's birthday weekend.
539347	541028	And this bitch will be at Disneyland.
541028	544091	She wants to get the hell out of town, which I don't blame her.
544091	546593	So, yeah, this is me.
546593	547834	I'm on Big Thunder.
550322	552664	I'm surprised you're not taking- How was your gaming week?
552664	555207	My gaming week was oh my god!
555207	562974	I'm surprised you're not taking the opportunity while you're down there to swing by Universal and go to Mario World, because I was just thinking, I still haven't been to Mario World.
562974	565576	Why would I support the company that supports the Harry Potter theme park?
565576	568439	Oh, that's right, I forgot you were doing that and that whole thing.
568439	573224	I mean, I might, but to be honest, Disneyland completely trumps Nintendo World.
573224	574185	Maybe I'll do them both.
574745	575366	and Sabra.
596764	598424	She's awesome.
598424	600225	And I want all the haters to shut the fuck up.
600225	601385	It's comic book character.
601385	605626	Is this one of the movie trailers they showed during that little little television televised?
605626	606286	I don't know.
606286	608107	They announced this like a couple weeks ago.
608107	609347	Okay, I wasn't aware.
609347	612908	I just know a lot of people are very excited about the trailers during the ball kicking game.
612908	613668	Deadpool.
613668	616028	They have posted that I see them on our discord.
616028	621910	Good old Tiger Claw is always on it on our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to join us throughout the week.
621910	622570	I did.
622570	623490	That was I will say
624130	628414	TigerClaw was actually the first to put in front of my eyes the trailer for Wicked.
628414	634099	Now that got my attention because you know this gay loves a little musical theater, okay?
634099	640805	So the fact that Wicked is coming to the big screen with Ariana Grande at that, very excited.
640805	643267	So it looks like- To this day, I've only ever read the book.
643267	644468	Yeah, it looks like it has a killer cast.
644468	647911	I don't know how I feel about- And of course, the sequel, Son of a Witch.
649298	649899	All right.
649899	653342	Um, anyhow, let's get into our show for tonight.
653342	655063	We're gonna do a little something new tonight.
655063	655904	I figured why not?
655904	659848	We've, you know what, we're 992 episodes in.
659848	661009	Let's do a new segment.
661009	662751	We've never done this before.
662751	663732	So we're gonna try a new game.
663732	664672	Ready for Jaredol.
664672	664953	All right.
665871	666452	So let's do it.
666452	673557	Tonight's segment we're gonna do is, and by the way, something weird is going on with the website vognetwork.com tonight.
673557	675659	I've been getting a lot of timeouts and stuff.
675659	683225	So the bar that you see on the right side as you're watching us live on Twitch, it may be a little bit out of sync or take forever to move.
683225	684166	It's just, yeah, there it goes.
684166	686888	Finally, I hit the button like 60 seconds ago and now it just moves.
686888	690371	So just, I'm aware it's some weird blip.
690371	691332	I'm sure it's just some,
691892	694174	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
712432	729244	rolls around the show is usually pretty locked in save any like super last breaking last minute breaking news which actually was a little bit last week that kind of spills into tonight but don't worry I know what I know there's that big thing y'all every fucking buddies talking about
730204	731005	We're gonna get there.
731005	731705	Okay.
731705	738111	But first, let's revisit last week and play a little word association.
738111	742914	So I'm going to read a headline that we would have talked about last week.
742914	754884	And I would like DarkSakura, Loki, and Chat to react with one word responses to sum up your thoughts on the article.
754884	755304	Here we go.
755304	758306	Okay, the first story we would have talked about is
759475	771099	over 500 studios are currently developing or working on live service games.
771099	776901	Barf.
776901	779562	Why barf, Loki?
779562	786945	Because all of the live service games that like the majority of the live service games that come out are garbage.
788426	789187	DarkSakura, OneWord
808850	810411	Um, good for them.
810411	813151	My word would be I'm using a hyphenated word.
813151	814352	I'm being fancy.
814352	816873	I'm going to say self harm.
816873	819773	Self harm is my word.
819773	820714	Don't do it.
820714	821474	No, don't do it.
821474	823295	And I don't mean to glamorize or do anything like that.
823295	834458	The reason why I choose that word, I think you should be able to figure that out, is that this is this is how the industry, namely, boardroom people are choking themselves.
836044	836404	Underworld.
848945	853007	The next word, or sorry, the next article for a word.
853007	869733	The video game Suicide Squad Killed the Justice League was pulled offline for about an hour due to a bug that basically broke the, oh no, the bug would immediately break the, or excuse me, beat the game
870453	871034	early on.
871034	875657	So it was basically a game breaking bug that would instantly beat the game.
875657	886326	But it should be noted this was patched before the game actually released for the US, but by the time it released in New Zealand, which was a little bit earlier, this bug was out there.
886326	888528	So one word reactions to that.
888528	891991	DarkSakura, I hear you snickering, so I'm picking on you first.
891991	895574	Speedrun.
895574	896835	I was thinking the same thing.
896835	897235	Speedrun.
899787	900427	Okay, I like that.
900427	901228	All right.
901228	903309	Loki, same word or what do you have?
903309	912335	I was gonna say the same one, but I'm gonna say, kind of going back to that first story, Eye Roll.
912335	916278	My word would be Pigpen.
916278	919820	And the reason why, you remember the character from Charlie Brown, Pigpen?
919820	920260	Yeah.
920260	921902	Who had that little fart cloud that followed him?
921902	922542	That's the dirt around him.
922542	923102	Exactly.
923102	924663	That's this fucking game.
924663	927605	It has a little fart cloud around it wherever it goes.
927605	927946	That is...
929246	930906	That is my word.
930906	932667	All right.
932667	936208	Next story.
936208	942670	Was the mobile exclusive MMO Avatar The Reckoning cancelled?
942670	950512	Apparently, there were some strategic adjustments by the developer Arcasaur and Avatar, as in the movie, the series, all that.
950512	954293	Avatar Reckoning potentially cancelled.
954293	955414	Oh, you mean the blue people?
955414	955694	OK.
955694	956214	Yes.
956214	956634	Yes, that.
958429	961932	So, one word reaction to that.
961932	966136	Loki.
966136	970440	So?
970440	974764	Okay, DarkSakura.
974764	975345	Looking forward to it.
976624	977925	That's not a word.
977925	979046	That's not one word.
979046	981428	No, I said my word was sad.
981428	982009	Oh, sad.
982009	982649	Okay, I'm sorry.
982649	983230	It didn't come through.
983230	983710	It didn't come through.
983710	986112	I was gonna taser you for using more than one word.
986112	987573	All right.
987573	998722	It's a run on sentence with no punctuation or spaces, which means I'm really pissed off about it because I neglected to use any of those things that I always use.
998722	999183	Apathy.
999738	1000838	This is my word.
1000838	1001999	It's less Avatar.
1001999	1002459	It's less.
1002459	1003659	I mean, Avatar's fine.
1003659	1008881	I want to play the console game, but it's just mobile MMOs don't usually do it for me.
1008881	1009721	What?
1009721	1011661	I have I have the game.
1011661	1013062	Do you really?
1013062	1015362	Not not the reckoning one, but I have Frontiers of Pandora.
1015362	1018043	Oh, that that I would like to check out, actually.
1018043	1019764	It's it's pretty.
1019764	1020364	I bet.
1020364	1021204	I bet.
1021204	1024305	It's just it's it's I call it linearly open world.
1024305	1024445	Mm hmm.
1025569	1025830	Unobtainium
1042532	1045556	Niantic is working on a skateboard game called Skate Tricks.
1058553	1059074	Curious
1083680	1084900	That's my word.
1084900	1087741	I'm curious, but I'm not totally convinced.
1087741	1089522	But that's my word.
1089522	1091183	DarkSakura, your word.
1091183	1093783	My word's an acronym.
1093783	1096084	NDA.
1096084	1096905	Okay.
1096905	1098625	Loki?
1098625	1100586	Cool.
1100586	1101926	I mean, the video looks cool.
1101926	1111890	Honestly, the video, it's like... The best way to describe it would be, you know how when you're a kid, you kind of imagine, you know,
1113289	1113689	Thanks for watching!
1132168	1140672	Alright, our next headline for One Word Reactions is that there's a collaboration happening between Destiny 2 and Mass Effect.
1140672	1148595	That's right, some inspired dress-ups from Mass Effect will be coming to Destiny 2 on February 13th.
1148595	1158739	That's cosmetics, in-game items, like N7 armor of course, apparently a Garrus set for Hunters, a Liara set for Warlocks, and yes.
1160000	1161040	That's that's that's it.
1161040	1169462	So some cosmetics and stuff for Destiny 2 inspired by Mass Effect, which, of course, is a game we have gone on and on and on and on at length about about how much we love it here on this show.
1169462	1178183	Well, at least DarkSakura and I. So that being said, DarkSakura, I'll go to your word first.
1178183	1182084	All I heard was like half a yawn coming through.
1182084	1183644	That's what I give a half a yawn.
1183644	1185405	That's my word.
1185405	1185865	Loki.
1185865	1187045	I don't give a shit about Destiny 2.
1187924	1192086	I would say nostalgiabate.
1192086	1196748	You're going to have to spell that B-A-T-E and make up a new word if you want that to be one word.
1196748	1197468	Nostalgiabate.
1197468	1198168	No hyphen.
1198168	1200529	If you can have a hyphenated word, so can Loki.
1200529	1201730	Fine.
1201730	1202510	All right.
1202510	1203851	I'm calling you on that one.
1203851	1205171	Okay, then fine.
1205171	1208873	I'm going to use another hyphenated word.
1208873	1211274	Reinstalling.
1211274	1214375	That's a single word.
1214375	1214675	All right.
1216372	1217192	Wireless Guitar Controller
1234517	1242660	PDP is the company that's making this, and there's a Series X and S version and Xbox One, and then there's a PS4 and a PS5 version.
1242660	1245061	So that was also on our list for last week.
1245061	1246542	So one word reactions.
1246542	1247962	Loki, you first.
1247962	1249123	Goodwill.
1249123	1256085	Because honestly, you could probably find these instruments already at Goodwill.
1256085	1259247	My word would be ozone.
1259247	1262168	DarkSakura, what's your word?
1262168	1262708	Okay.
1264406	1265547	That would be okay.
1265547	1268609	Ended with an interrobang.
1268609	1273733	SSJ100 Matt has contributed the word landfill in chat.
1273733	1276055	There you go.
1276055	1278957	I mean, in like, it's, here's the sad thing.
1278957	1281739	Like, I do miss the plastic instrument stuff.
1281739	1284722	And it would be fun to play like once or twice.
1284722	1288324	And like, remember the fun but then after that, it's like, oh, here's this
1289107	1291868	Bullshit taking up space in my room again.
1291868	1292589	All right.
1292589	1292929	One more.
1292929	1294250	Here's here's the last one.
1294250	1295230	This is great.
1295230	1299752	Now, remember, this was last week's stories.
1299752	1311038	And the headline we would have talked about last week was two video game leakers have said a Nintendo Direct presentation is coming this week.
1311038	1311578	Wrong.
1311578	1312158	Including.
1315333	1329116	including, and I'm naming them, Special Nick, who mentioned this on Nintendo Prime's YouTube channel or whatever, and a reliable leaker named Bill Bill Coon, who posted a message on Twitter about it.
1329116	1335117	So and of course, we already know the punchline that that that turned out not to be true.
1335117	1336897	We did not have a Nintendo Direct last week.
1336897	1339317	So Loki's word is wrong.
1339317	1341758	DarkSakura, what would your word be?
1341758	1342158	Whatever.
1344116	1350399	My word would be... My word would be... That's my word.
1350399	1355162	Unreliable.
1355162	1356022	All right.
1356022	1356303	Let's see.
1356303	1362266	I want to see if anybody in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network had a... I agree with Mike, we're being LMAO.
1362266	1363746	Yeah, LMAO.
1363746	1366668	Maybe they're confusing companies.
1366668	1367729	Yeah, maybe.
1367729	1369169	Maybe there was... Oh boy.
1370718	1377820	It's like, it's like your, your, your mom, you know, your mom telling you like, oh, there's a Nintendo Direct this week.
1377820	1379361	Mom, that's just, that's Sony.
1379361	1382142	Isn't that all the same?
1382142	1383342	It's all Nintendo.
1383342	1384762	There's a new Nintendo coming.
1384762	1386823	Haven't you heard?
1386823	1388624	Mom, it's a PlayStation.
1388624	1395266	That new Nintendo show Halo's coming for season two.
1395266	1397426	They're making another Super Mario movie.
1397426	1399427	I saw it on Access Hollywood.
1400322	1408086	Although I say I say that now and you know, who knows in the very future we could get, you know, a Nintendo Halo or something.
1408086	1408706	Yeah.
1408706	1409126	Yeah.
1409126	1413128	Okay, well, let's, let's, let's talk about that, actually.
1413128	1418210	So there's been a lot of rumors going around this week.
1418210	1422432	This is okay, I'm gonna just pitch it to Loki.
1422432	1423873	I have thoughts.
1423873	1425194	I want to let Loki start us off.
1426641	1433604	I'm pretty sure any of you that follow video games closely are well aware about these rumors and maybe even waiting for our take on it.
1433604	1434445	I don't know.
1434445	1440748	But let's jump in and talk about what in the actual fuck is happening with Microsoft and Xbox.
1441848	1469783	Like here's the things like a lot of people like blowing this way out of proportion I feel like they're like overreacting to it basically that Microsoft is looking to publish some of their games on multiple platforms other than just the Xbox so for example the rumors are that Indiana Jones the Great Circle and Starfield are coming to the PlayStation 5 and then of course there's also
1471144	1481453	The HiFiRush and Sea of Thieves is coming to I believe PlayStation and maybe even the Switch.
1481453	1490220	Which, I mean, for Starfield that makes sense because I don't know if it's sold as well as they thought it would.
1490220	1498988	And they've talked about in the past how they want to kind of offer multi-platforms, especially for like Call of Duty and all that.
1499488	1499908	Starfield
1519702	1534436	It makes a lot of sense to release Starfield on the PS5 because the reality is the game is not meeting the expectations it originally, you know, despite your personal feelings about the game or anything like that, this game, I don't, I don't know if I would, it would be accurate to say it flopped.
1534436	1537499	But it definitely was made out to be a lot bigger deal than it actually is.
1537499	1538800	But here's the thing.
1538800	1539421	Here's the thing.
1540947	1552410	Diablo 3 got a huge boost after its PC release and its initial kind of crash and burn with the real monkey, real money, excuse me, auction house and all that stuff.
1552410	1556151	But you had it right the first time, real monkey, auction house.
1556151	1569454	It had a rough ride at the beginning there, but when it re-released on consoles with the additional expansion pack and all that and had the console release, that's when the game started to get a lot of steam and found another life.
1570316	1586528	It's releasing Starfield on PlayStation 5 would allow people to be able to approach that game with fresh judgment after the patches, after these fixes, after the work Bethesda's trying to do to improve the game, and possibly breathe a second life into this game.
1586528	1587369	So honestly,
1588649	1594114	I think this is actually a great fucking idea if they're going to release Starfield on the PlayStation 5.
1594114	1598857	Questbuster in chat says Starfield is not generating the kind of hype that its predecessors did.
1598857	1601459	Even some modders wrote it off because of how it was designed.
1601459	1602059	Yep.
1602059	1604581	PodCulture says worked for No Man's Sky.
1604581	1608844	And, you know, you could draw the parallel there about No Man's Sky was a PlayStation exclusive.
1608844	1614749	It launched on other consoles and it, you know, got a second wind in part because, I mean, of course, all the patches helped too, but.
1615389	1627900	And that's kind of the same thing what's happening with this, allegedly, is that the rumor is that they're working on the port and that's supposed to come out after the Shattered Space DLC, which comes out later this year.
1627900	1636066	So it would almost be, I can almost imagine it coming out like almost a year later than the initial release, which you have a lot of these timed exclusives.
1636066	1637567	And yeah, it's a little strange that
1638328	1639369	Sony MLB The Show
1655393	1660716	Of course, Minecraft is on all the platforms, and that's a Microsoft company as well.
1660716	1664598	It's not so unusual nowadays to see something like that.
1664598	1673643	What I think people are pushing it to is they're like, well, if all the exclusives now go to Sony, then what's the point of me buying an Xbox?
1673643	1675984	I think you're jumping the conclusions there.
1675984	1679346	However, though, I think there is something to this because
1680655	1688906	Phil Spencer announced that there's a business update event next week that's supposed to like address this stuff.
1688906	1692590	So I'm wondering what that means necessarily.
1692590	1694393	So we'll have to wait and see, I guess.
1695294	1695494	I don't
1718311	1733097	y'all between the superbowl and these fucking youtubers getting their clicks i have never seen so many straight men with unwashed assholes be so dramatic in my entire fucking life
1733797	1733857	and
1753837	1756820	Stop treating everything like sports teams.
1756820	1757981	These are game consoles.
1757981	1759782	These are corporations.
1759782	1762664	They don't care what your opinion is on this.
1762664	1765647	It's whatever makes sense to them.
1765647	1768829	I mean, yeah, but I'm saying there's everything.
1768829	1773053	It's like politics, game companies, sports.
1773053	1776656	Everybody is like, oh, I got to root for one side and your side sucks.
1776656	1779238	It's like, who cares?
1779238	1781660	People also get off on the whole exclusivity thing.
1783280	1789204	You know, like, oh, I have this system and I can play this and you can't.
1789204	1792887	It's very, it's very... Are they like a kindergartner?
1792887	1795950	I mean, like, honestly, like, who cares?
1795950	1802795	I'm going to paraphrase something that Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us, wrote on social media that I thought was very succinct.
1802795	1804236	It put it very succinct.
1804236	1807578	Not everybody can afford to buy every video game console.
1807578	1809500	Those of us that own more than one console,
1810220	1814402	are privileged in a way to be able to do that and own that.
1814402	1816023	Not everybody can spend the money.
1816023	1823006	So people buy the console that they decide, they choose, they weigh the options, they buy the console, and they want to be right.
1823006	1826448	They want to make sure they made the right decision and all the right.
1826448	1832591	So if you're somebody who maybe doesn't have a ton of money and you invested in Microsoft and Xbox,
1833431	1851716	I can see where this news is very jarring because you wanted to be right and you trusted Microsoft and gave the money and all this stuff and now you know according to the internet the world is melting but something very important very important these are all still rumors and that's why it's weird for me to even talk about this because
1853152	1860936	Literally this week, according to what Phil Spencer said, we're going to get some clarity and then we can actually talk about it.
1860936	1868820	Because right now, all of this is smoke, mirrors, clickbait, speculation, and internet gone wild.
1868820	1878385	And I also will say this, I'm going to use an analogy that I've heard many times, is that
1880524	1885486	Opening a pie for other people to have some doesn't diminish your own slice of pie.
1885486	1886206	That's right.
1886206	1887806	It just means everyone has pie.
1887806	1900670	And SSU 100 Matt just points out the, and this is very fair, Sony influencers know better because when PlayStation games went to PC, we saw these same theatrics going on, but it should be pointed out.
1900670	1908013	Sony had the sense to put their games on PC, which, you know, the vast majority of that is running on a Microsoft platform.
1908593	1911895	So Sony has released games on a Microsoft platform.
1911895	1913356	Think about it.
1913356	1914737	Well, and here's the thing, too.
1914737	1921301	It's like you are complaining about people getting a chance to play Starfield, like.
1921301	1923942	You should be glad somebody still wants to play it.
1923942	1924483	Exactly.
1924483	1925944	It's like it's like, oh, no.
1927803	1928303	What's next?
1928303	1931204	Are they gonna publish Redfall on the PlayStation as well?
1931204	1933565	I mean, like, it's... Who cares?
1933565	1938087	It's not that gr... It's... It's not a Skyrim, that's for sure.
1938087	1945469	It's pretty underwhelming, and, like... Sure, I'm sure the Indiana Jones game will be great.
1945469	1950191	I don't think it's gonna be like, whoa, this is the best game ever, I need to buy an Xbox for this.
1950191	1952012	It's gonna be alright.
1952012	1955013	It'll be probably on par with the Wolfenstein games, but, like...
1956969	1961572	I just, I really don't see what the point is of like arguing about this.
1961572	1962693	It's such a stupid thing.
1962693	1967616	They're not saying like, hey, the next Halo game we're publishing is going on Sony's platform as well.
1967616	1969377	Then maybe you can get a little upset.
1969377	1975682	But then once again, just because somebody gets to play it on Sony's platform doesn't mean it takes away from you.
1975682	1977563	And hey, maybe there's cross play.
1977563	1982066	Now you get to play with some of your friends that have a Sony PlayStation instead of just your Xbox friends.
1982066	1985448	Like, oh no, now we'll have more fun.
1985448	1986449	That sounds terrible.
1987370	1994657	And far from the chatroom, you can have cake or pie or you can have cake pie.
1994657	1996779	Just get PC and wait.
1996779	1998501	I want to do what I do.
1998501	1999782	Have a Mac.
1999782	2001544	I've got to reply and then you won't play anything.
2001544	2002525	I'm just kidding.
2002525	2003606	No.
2003606	2003926	No.
2003926	2005327	I had to take the cheap shot.
2005327	2005668	Come on.
2007017	2008317	I can play lots of stuff.
2008317	2010978	Especially now with game porting kit, I can pretty much play anything.
2010978	2016600	Well, and on a serious note, I know you do a lot of streaming with cloud gaming.
2016600	2024442	And I think if you really want to look forward, which I think in part, you know, again, we don't know until Microsoft actually fucking clarifies it.
2024442	2027203	But I think there's a lot Microsoft wants to do with cloud gaming.
2027203	2029124	We know that we've known this.
2029904	2039870	Microsoft may be thinking and starting to telegraph a world that doesn't have consoles in the way that we're used to knowing it.
2039870	2045693	They've said a long time ago, Game Pass is where it's at.
2045693	2052156	If you're buying a Game Pass subscription through your Samsung TV that runs a Game Pass app, guess what?
2052156	2053357	Microsoft still wins.
2054958	2074129	If by some grace of God, there is a Game Pass app that lets you play cloud games on your PlayStation 5 on the Xbox thing, a literal Netflix library that Xbox is running, but it's video games on your PS5, if that should come to pass, Microsoft wins.
2074129	2077291	So there is- And I'll be technical.
2077291	2082955	The games that I play through the GeForce experience, they're technically being run off of a virtual PC.
2082955	2083295	Yeah.
2084595	2090918	So, but I really think it's really about cloud to be honest.
2090918	2093939	Um, but I want to respond to this comment in chat because I think this is important.
2093939	2104003	It's, it's, it's up a little ways, but it's been on my mind for a minute where Tiger Claw said, uh, if that happens, Sony and Nintendo will have to release their games on other platforms too.
2104003	2107305	Well, first things first, nobody has to do shit.
2107305	2110146	It may put some pressure on Sony.
2111687	2115790	I think Nintendo that Nintendo Nintendo doesn't have a streaming platform.
2115790	2120173	Nintendo will go bankrupt before they put Mario on PlayStation.
2120173	2121213	Nintendo will go.
2121213	2127717	But if the Wii U did not cause Mario to go to PlayStation, it's not happening.
2127717	2137564	And I'm I don't mean to sound mean, but I just I need people to understand Nintendo is not interested in that ever.
2138204	2150053	Nintendo also has a very key difference between themselves, Sony and Microsoft.
2150053	2153255	Not only are they, by most accords,
2154724	2159607	the greatest game makers in the business, period.
2159607	2167873	They make the best games, better than EA, Ubisoft, Blizzard, Microsoft, Sony, you name it.
2167873	2173317	There's a little opinion in there, but even if you think it's somebody else, you'd be hard-pressed not to say, yeah, but Nintendo's up there.
2174591	2186111	And the other thing is, Nintendo designs their systems unlike the PlayStation and Xbox to be sold at a profit, not a loss.
2189036	2194722	So they make money when you buy a Switch and whatever the Switch's successor will be.
2194722	2204532	That's why they've always lagged behind a little bit in the tech department and the power department is they've always made that decision to make a profit.
2204532	2212880	So they're going to keep moving those consoles by keeping their quadruple A games on that platform.
2214744	2225752	And maybe I will eat my words, but I will probably be dead before I have to because it's not going to happen for at least 25, probably even more, 40 years before something like that ever happens.
2225752	2239261	So remember, Nintendo has a shit ton of cash on hand, and it saved them from the disaster of the Wii U. Anyway.
2239261	2243124	What else on this Xbox topic do we need to discuss?
2245640	2245900	Meh.
2255492	2268962	I think there was one I wanted to mention that there was a like counter rumor, which is weird, but yeah, Phil Spencer said in a meeting, basically that like Microsoft is not stopping making Xbox consoles.
2268962	2270904	That was kind of the latest development of that whole thing.
2270904	2271124	Yeah.
2271124	2283714	I just want to make sure that was out there because I thought I kind of found that an interesting development and it just goes to show seven days from now, we'll have a more educated perspective on all of this right now.
2283714	2285055	This is all just
2286354	2287835	making it up.
2287835	2292837	But I, I swear, some of you need to unsubscribe from certain YouTube channels.
2292837	2294498	Seriously, seriously, you.
2294498	2297959	I really could you do me a favor?
2297959	2300600	Like, honestly, look, we don't charge for this show.
2300600	2303161	We don't ask you to pay for it or any of that stuff.
2303161	2309704	Would you please make it a goal this week to evaluate the YouTube channels that you are subscribed to?
2309704	2311725	And the people that are just
2313573	2315394	milking this for all that it's worth.
2315394	2319335	Will you please consider unsubscribing from that crap?
2319335	2327778	Will you please stop making folks feel like it's okay to just ring the hysteria alarm like this?
2327778	2332020	It's wild to me.
2332020	2337402	Anyway, hopefully none of you were subscribing to that stuff in the first place, but it happens sometimes you accidentally click oops, you know,
2339087	2346363	And I am going to say with any social media, fact check before you repost.
2346363	2348467	And we do not have the facts right now.
2350054	2351215	Exactly.
2351215	2352876	But it is interesting.
2352876	2363022	I will say when I first first heard about this, which I believe the earliest buzz of this was coming up right before the show last week because I kind of said that earlier as I think there was last minute breaking news.
2363022	2365843	I think the earliest because we we had the whole thing about the physical games.
2365843	2369926	Remember that two weeks ago that Walmart was beginning to scale back on the Xbox games and all that?
2370186	2370306	Sigh...
2397616	2403902	SSJ100 Matt says, damn, my ASMR car detailing channel is subbed to is on notice.
2403902	2404522	You know what?
2404522	2406544	There's there's a time and a place for ASMR.
2406544	2407284	I'm not here to talk.
2407284	2411328	I'm not here to start a war with ASMR streamers and YouTubers.
2411328	2412689	If that's your thing, fine.
2412689	2413590	Stop it.
2413590	2415871	If that's your thing, fine.
2415871	2421356	At least put it in your, like, title if you're doing ASMR shit so I can, like, leave your channel.
2424790	2426631	It's really triggering for me, actually.
2426631	2427952	It really is for a lot of people.
2427952	2429092	Interesting.
2429092	2431653	Well, most people, especially if you have sensory issues.
2431653	2435875	Most people on Twitch tag it, so pretty easy to find and avoid it.
2435875	2437055	But not everyone does.
2437055	2438996	No.
2438996	2441637	I hate listening to people whisper.
2441637	2447500	I was going to say, when this news first broke, I did sort of go, oh, is this?
2447500	2452422	And did anyone else have this thought that, oh, all those people Microsoft laid off?
2453473	2455374	They're squealing.
2455374	2459017	And can yeah, can you blame them?
2459017	2461639	Can you blame them?
2461639	2462920	Should squeal more.
2462920	2464221	All right.
2464221	2464742	I love that.
2464742	2470426	SD 100 Matt in chat says unsub from those channels and sub to Loki's channel at Loki OLR.
2470426	2470746	Yes.
2470746	2475530	And please don't forget VOG Network as well.
2475530	2477011	All right.
2477011	2478032	Okay.
2478032	2479092	Don't forget Jamie.
2479092	2479793	Of course.
2479793	2482255	And me, but you know, um,
2483078	2486762	Also, what?
2486762	2488805	What?
2488805	2490847	Hello?
2490847	2491328	Hello?
2491328	2492690	Yeah, you said, Hey, Rob.
2492690	2493611	And then what?
2493611	2494291	Nothing.
2494291	2496574	Oh, no.
2496574	2496935	No.
2496935	2497195	Okay.
2497884	2498584	Jk
2517998	2521100	We're going to be having this conversation more in depth.
2521100	2525482	And then watch Nintendo disrupt the entire thing.
2525482	2527643	That would be so funny.
2527643	2528624	If Microsoft does their thing.
2528624	2530545	They're waiting for that D.Va level mic drop.
2530545	2536688	Microsoft does their thing on Wednesday, and then that night, Nintendo puts out a thing that says, we got a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.
2536688	2540030	Watch Nintendo disrupt this whole fucking thing just because they can.
2542332	2543313	We'll see what happens.
2543313	2544093	All right.
2544093	2551339	In the meantime, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week or the last two weeks, if you will.
2551339	2553921	And how was your gaming week?
2553921	2557564	Sorry, S100 Matt says Nintendo is waiting for the press release via fax.
2557564	2565130	This type of this type of countermaneuver that I get your tech joke, by the way, this countermaneuver has been done before.
2566539	2572323	I point at the infamous E3 after the Xbox One price was unveiled.
2572323	2579007	Sony had three versions of their press event ready to go with three different prices.
2579007	2579608	They were ready for it.
2579608	2582470	This will be Nintendo doing the wig reveal.
2582470	2584671	Yeah.
2584671	2589174	Do not remove your wig unless there is another wig underneath.
2589174	2592576	That would be a good lesson for Phil Spencer to learn this week.
2592576	2595058	Or, or rose petals.
2595058	2595979	All right.
2597273	2598960	And your name is Sasha Velour.
2598960	2600928	Now we can get into your gaming week.
2600928	2602032	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2603650	2608634	Well, I beat Ruru no Hiho last weekend, and I don't have a game to replace it.
2608634	2614499	I was thinking of either Emerald Dragon or going back to start over on Star Ocean.
2614499	2622226	So in lieu of that, I actually played the new game mode in Dead by Daylight last night.
2622226	2627550	I played the Lights Out mode for Dead by Daylight, and honestly, it was fun.
2627550	2630092	And I played Pig because, of course, I play Pig.
2631481	2634342	And I had a really good time.
2634342	2636283	I think I also did a hag game.
2636283	2639485	It didn't go as well as my pig games did.
2639485	2641525	But it was really fun, you know?
2641525	2654771	It was... Oh, and because not so many people are playing them, I actually got the exact same SWF a second time, and they're like, oh shit, I bet it's the same pig, and it was me, so they're just like, we give up.
2654771	2657912	But I played Survivor as well with...
2659913	2661436	Pie, Kitsune, Larry's
2675077	2677739	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2697150	2697810	It was pretty jumpy.
2697810	2701472	I had a lot of fun with it as Survivor as well.
2701472	2708156	But I did find that I liked playing Pig because I could see where all of my jigsaw boxes were.
2708156	2712138	And it gave me an idea for the distance on the map.
2715320	2727083	And I think that if I were to go play Hag or something, I would use her little traps to mark landmarks, so that I'd have a general idea where they are.
2727083	2729904	And we played against a couple of Doctors.
2729904	2735326	They were very effective in Larius, but not completely effective.
2735326	2739687	And then of course we had a Legion who was just like, Legion has it made in this mode.
2740896	2748880	So anyway, I'm very curious how the unreal plays in this mode because I really like playing her when I play killer and I just feel like she would be a lot of fun.
2748880	2751000	I haven't played her since she got changed.
2751000	2752061	I forgot they changed her.
2752061	2755042	I haven't played her since she got changed either.
2755042	2756463	I'll have to have to give it a try.
2756463	2761325	She was quickly becoming my secondary and then I don't know but Freddy's disabled for some reason.
2761325	2763806	Oh, yeah, I don't get it.
2763806	2768468	Maybe it's because with the dark mode his dream doesn't work quite well.
2768468	2769509	Well, maybe it's for the best.
2769509	2770149	Maybe they'll delete them.
2771457	2772039	No!
2772039	2772661	I'm kidding.
2772661	2773705	Freddy's my secondary.
2773705	2776936	I'm kidding.
2776936	2777498	But, um...
2779784	2782585	I also played Genshin Impact.
2782585	2786428	I'm having a lot more fun in that game than I thought that I would.
2786428	2789169	I just went on an exploration fest.
2789169	2792892	I had a lot of fun just running around and exploring.
2792892	2798335	And then I came back and finished up my dailies for reasons.
2798335	2801157	But I'm having a lot more fun with it than I thought that I would.
2801157	2804218	So, really, really good.
2804218	2804579	And then...
2807102	2818090	Honestly, I think that's it for what I played just because I worked 10 hour days and then I had a head part of my toenail removed permanently.
2818090	2818911	Oh, wow.
2818911	2819811	On my big toe.
2819811	2828678	And my other big toe will be following suit when this one heals so that I do not get ingrown toenails when I do ballet because ballet is very important to me.
2828678	2831120	Been there, done that.
2831120	2834122	Oh, yours were permanently removed with the thumbnail and everything?
2834122	2835383	Well, they tried.
2836445	2837626	didn't work.
2837626	2838666	They tried.
2838666	2840307	It's all jacked up now.
2840307	2841168	Oh my gosh.
2841168	2842949	It hurts to walk around for a while.
2842949	2849633	I don't get ingrown toenails anymore, but they didn't do it right.
2849633	2852875	They weren't bad, but every time I'd cut them out, they'd get worse.
2852875	2854496	So I just had them take care of it.
2854496	2861361	But the fun thing is that last night I was trying to sleep and I felt like my toe was swelling.
2861361	2863542	It was really pushing on the bandages.
2863542	2864743	And then I was thinking,
2865683	2870644	What if they did, like, one of those hospital games?
2870644	2873145	Like, what was the ones on Wii U?
2873145	2873945	Or Wii?
2873945	2874705	Trauma Center?
2874705	2875686	Trauma Center.
2875686	2876086	Oh my god.
2876086	2877346	Yeah.
2877346	2883988	What if they did one that was called, like, America's Next Podiatrist or something?
2883988	2887929	I mean, Steam is a large storefront.
2887929	2888609	It's possible.
2888609	2890350	Somebody's made it up by now, right?
2890350	2891650	It's possible it already exists.
2892751	2894412	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2915427	2925615	In fact, even today, not to get too far ahead of myself, but like Pikmin Bloom and the community day going on to get 10,000 steps is what incentivized me to go take a long walk today.
2925615	2929217	I'm still not at 10,000 steps, though, by the way, which is very disappointing.
2929217	2933901	There needs to be something like that for ballet.
2933901	2936603	I don't know if Dr. Lee has a game like that, SSJ100, Dr. Pimple Popper.
2938997	2939578	LA Monga
2954905	2957647	Uh, my gaming week was mostly editing.
2957647	2961830	So I've been editing this episode for, uh, it's Fever Dream.
2961830	2968836	So that wrapped up at the end of January and I've been editing that episode ever since.
2968836	2979484	Uh, it's been a struggle because I am making something that is either the worst thing I've made or the best thing or both at the same time.
2979484	2979604	Um,
2981629	2985253	It lives up to a fever dream.
2985253	2987554	So that'll be coming out here hopefully very soon.
2987554	2993840	I was trying to get it done this weekend, but I still have a little bit left to do.
2993840	2997523	But we're down to the final bit of the episode.
2997523	2999725	So it'll be coming out very soon.
2999725	3004549	And I'm sorry for what you're going to witness if you watch it.
3005578	3006758	Sounds fun.
3006758	3010340	Alright, if that's it, then we'll talk about my gaming week.
3010340	3017622	Um, yeah, I guess I don't talk a lot about like the GPS games, but I'm still playing things like Ingress, which by the way, just rolled out bounties, which is very interesting.
3017622	3020463	They now have and you can get a little bit of gear from this.
3020463	3025525	They basically it's interesting how much Ingress has influenced Pokemon Go is in turn influencing Ingress.
3025845	3031369	because basically it's the equivalent of Pokemon quests that you get from Pokestops are now like a thing in Ingress that you get every day.
3031369	3033451	So it's kind of it's kind of cute.
3033451	3041677	I like that they're still putting more stuff in that game, even though I hit max level again in that game for the fourth time, because you can go back and start from the beginning.
3041677	3044099	It's the recursion on it, but I'm not doing it again.
3044099	3047462	Like I'm going to have to have a real good reason to hit that recurse button again.
3047462	3053767	So it's kind of just, yeah, it's changed my outlook and approach on that game a little bit because I don't have to like microfield everywhere I go.
3054207	3057749	And I kind of like that, to be honest, for those that know that gameplay.
3057749	3060650	Pokemon Go, I've actually been playing more of.
3060650	3063691	I was, you know, kind of playing it for a little bit.
3063691	3071715	But I had some nice, I had a nice little cash infusion this week, we'll put it that way.
3071715	3076357	And so I said, You know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy something stupid.
3077057	3077498	DarkSakura
3095953	3098075	Pokemon Go Plus Pluses
3118809	3123331	I did buy one of those because I didn't realize this when those first came out.
3123331	3127874	Not only do they, you know, track your sleep, which I have no interest in doing that.
3127874	3139579	I still feel that I if I'm going to play Pokemon sleep, it needs to use the watch and the Apple health and all that that I already have that tracks sleep more accurately than the Pokemon thing does.
3139579	3141260	So I'm not interested in that end of it.
3141260	3144982	But the Go Plus Plus has an auto catcher.
3145442	3145742	Niantic
3164229	3164709	Final Fantasy XIV
3186727	3186827	Steve
3201664	3202164	Thanks for watching!
3219537	3221799	So it's fine.
3221799	3224141	I guess I'll have to watch a summary, something like that.
3224141	3225141	I mean, I played the game.
3225141	3225922	I know what happens.
3225922	3227803	But I like to be I want to be refreshed, right?
3227803	3229184	You got to, you got to go in.
3229184	3232787	It's like, it's like when they release movies in multiple parts, right?
3232787	3237691	You want to go see the first part before you go to the theater or watch the second part or whatever it is.
3237691	3238291	So um,
3239468	3244032	That's, that's how I was feeling about Final Fantasy VII Remake, but I'm really looking forward to Rebirth.
3244032	3247736	Rebirth comes out the day I get home from the cruise.
3247736	3255504	And then thankfully, the way it works out, I have like that whole weekend off to just recover to take a vacation from the vacation.
3255504	3259407	And that is exactly how I plan on spending it is playing that game.
3259407	3260528	So it'll be good.
3261530	3263472	All right, that's it for my Game of the Week.
3263472	3268396	Let's get into some more headlines from the week in gaming news.
3268396	3273521	Loki, this is an interesting little coda to what we talked about at the top of the show, but it's worth talking about anyway.
3273521	3274222	So Loki.
3275171	3281612	Yeah, apparently, there's been some sales data that's come out that looks like- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3281612	3283493	I have to stop for a chat comment.
3283493	3284593	What?
3284593	3289454	DJ Ranma S in chat says, you said, or Esther says something about Pimple Popper.
3289454	3292095	DJ Ranma S says, I was on an episode of her show.
3292095	3294395	What?
3294395	3296476	Like, what?
3296476	3298356	Were you in the background?
3298356	3301957	Or like, somebody that's, were you an actual patient on that show?
3303200	3305761	I have seasons of this show paid for.
3305761	3306921	I need to find.
3306921	3307382	Oh, okay.
3307382	3308362	He said in the background.
3308362	3311763	I was like, Ranma was on Pimple Popper and I never knew.
3311763	3312564	What?
3312564	3313904	But he says, okay, it was in the background.
3313904	3316545	I was like, we have to stop the shoot for this.
3316545	3317245	Yes, we did.
3317245	3318266	Yes, we did, Loki.
3319514	3322716	Oh, there's a cosplay episode.
3322716	3324678	Okay, so he's probably some compilation.
3324678	3327480	But that's like when I was on Drag Race.
3327480	3329702	And I tell everybody I was on RuPaul's Drag Race.
3329702	3330622	They do a double take.
3330622	3333785	And I'm like, yeah, I was in a deleted scene for season four.
3333785	3334825	It's it's on the web.
3334825	3336467	You can see it on there.
3336467	3338068	But it's a yeah.
3339554	3351287	So anyway, sorry Loki, but it was very important that we get clarity because if Ranma was on an episode of Pimple Popper, I would stop this entire fucking show to go pull it up on Amazon Prime and watch it right now.
3351287	3354891	As much as that stuff makes me squeamish, I'd have to see it.
3354891	3355812	I'd have to see it.
3355812	3356072	All right.
3358481	3367887	According to a Take-Two Games Q3 financial report, about 77 million Gen 9 consoles have been sold as of December 2023.
3375491	3395448	50 million, well we know that 50 million Playstations have been sold to consumers already thanks to Sony and so you can kind of do the math and see that basically the PlayStation 5 is selling or outselling the Xbox series consoles 2 to 1.
3395448	3399011	It's fun to do math because then it proves your team is right.
3400347	3400407	and
3417990	3418491	doesn't say.
3435319	3438561	which by the way, so that makes, yeah, I guess it could be, I don't know.
3438561	3439441	Can I go quick?
3439441	3441022	Can I peek around this corner real quick?
3441022	3441382	Do it.
3441382	3445784	What happens with the overdose game that Kojima is making with all this Xbox?
3445784	3450286	Cause that's like a huge exclusive for them is Kojima's overdose game.
3450286	3452968	So what, or OD or whatever it's called.
3452968	3455469	Sony gets their, their game too, remember?
3455469	3459631	But isn't it supposed to be like, it's powered with Xbox cloud and all that stuff.
3460413	3465716	Oh, you know, like, I'm very sick of hearing their games powered by Xbox Cloud.
3465716	3467817	What did that do to Crackdown 3?
3467817	3468418	Nothing.
3468418	3469759	That game sucked.
3469759	3478184	So like, I, Xbox Cloud, powering a game, that, that literally means nothing.
3478184	3478484	All right.
3478484	3483187	To be determined, I guess with this whole thing, but it's, it's something I've been thinking about.
3483187	3488990	What, what, that whole nine minutes at the Game Awards where they took announcing that game, what, what, what happened?
3492670	3500920	A month later, 6 weeks later, here we are.
3500920	3502182	Oh yes, outselling.
3502182	3510432	I hate to say it, I don't want to sound like I'm shitting on Xbox because I do love my Series X. I think it's a great console, but are we surprised?
3512080	3516863	Um, like, first off, I don't think it's a big deal.
3516863	3527650	I mean, it is, like, certainly the numbers don't look great, but when you think about it, like, for me, like, I have an Xbox Series X. I don't use that system at all.
3527650	3530692	It is literally in a box below my desk right now.
3530692	3538718	I use my PC to play literally everything that comes out because all of their games that they release on that console are on PC.
3538718	3540058	So I can see where
3541219	3552486	Yeah, they're not selling as much hardware, but to them, maybe that's not such a big deal because they have Game Pass, they have people playing those games on PC.
3552486	3554787	I'd be curious to see how that kind of all factors in.
3554787	3563132	I don't think we're getting the full picture with just console sales anymore, especially in this year, 2024, where the landscape's kind of completely different.
3563132	3568836	So, I mean, that would almost be like saying, you know, when you're talking about game sales and stuff, it's like, oh, well, they only sold, you know,
3571098	3581589	250,000 copies physical, you know, it's like, well, but yeah, because they're selling a lot of that digital or as well, you know, they there's a part of that equation that we're not seeing.
3581589	3582349	So I would
3583391	3589612	Wait and see what Microsoft says, you know, as far as what their numbers are or how about this?
3589612	3595014	Um, I mean, yeah, it's cool to have that factoid, but like, does that really mean anything to us?
3595014	3595574	Nope.
3595574	3598734	Because we are consumers and we're not the companies running this.
3598734	3601795	And we're also not like, I don't work for Microsoft.
3601795	3604155	I don't get paid on the commission about how many units they sell.
3604155	3607956	I, you know, the fate of their company, it doesn't rest in my hands.
3607956	3609637	So.
3609637	3609797	Yeah.
3612503	3614325	All right, let's move on.
3614325	3619550	I mean, again, I feel like there's there's not a lot else to say to this until we hear what Microsoft is planning next week.
3619550	3621712	So I'm just gonna leave it at that.
3621712	3625476	I will move on to something that of course, a lot of people are looking forward to towards the end of the month.
3625476	3628780	And that is the release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
3628780	3630241	Of course, that is on its way.
3630241	3632784	And there was a whole direct that happened.
3632784	3633565	Sorry, not direct.
3633565	3635246	PlayStation State of Play.
3635246	3635527	I mean,
3636267	3645272	It's basically, it's just like, just like their move controllers were original, like, I mean, come on, they were just ripping the format off.
3645638	3659280	So they did an event and it all of course was uh you know at the end they ended up announcing a demo was out and it was coming out today and it's available on the PlayStation Store and a lot of people have been jumping in and playing it.
3659280	3667822	It is the first chapter of Rebirth which is the story I believe of Nibelheim from the original game and what all goes down in that sequence.
3667822	3673783	The interesting thing is they have said that they plan to add to the demo a little more later on
3674383	3679865	Closer to the game's release, which I find kind of a weird way to do a demo, but okay.
3679865	3682526	That all being said, this may surprise you.
3682526	3683646	Oh no, here it is.
3683646	3684226	Junon.
3684226	3690128	The demo is going to be updated to extend Cloud Earth, Tifa Barrett, and Red XIII in Junon.
3690128	3692589	No mention about save progress carrying over.
3692589	3695010	I don't know if people have found out if that's the case or not.
3695010	3698591	I'm going to say something here that might surprise you.
3698591	3701792	I did not watch the State of Play.
3701792	3702612	I'm not going to play the demo.
3703993	3706214	And I did play the demo for Remake.
3706214	3707976	And you might wonder, wait, what's going on, Rob?
3707976	3708836	Is your tone changed?
3708836	3711898	No, it's quite simply this.
3711898	3714500	I would just like to experience the game.
3715697	3716458	when it comes out.
3739008	3744574	because even though the first chapter, I could play it right now, I'm just kind of like, you know what?
3744574	3746636	I'm going to just wait and do the whole thing.
3746636	3747317	I'd rather do that.
3749093	3753515	And I don't really need I don't want to see all the hype on all this other stuff they put in the game.
3753515	3756156	Yeah, Questbuster in chat says the presentation was nice.
3756156	3759138	But at this point, I just want to play it and not hear any more hype.
3759138	3760659	Yeah, I heard they're adding a lot of stuff to it.
3760659	3766221	Like there's a whole little card game in there now, which makes sense of the gold saucers a part of it, you know, they want to kind of tie it to that.
3766221	3767982	And they're doing all these other cool things with it.
3767982	3769823	But I'm just like, you know what?
3769823	3772805	Just bring it on.
3772805	3775186	I'll play it when I play it.
3775186	3776827	All right.
3776827	3777307	Let's move on.
3778368	3783630	Something else I could play now that it's available, DarkSakura.
3783630	3789732	Well, y'all know I love my Super Nintendo, Super Famicom games.
3789732	3804017	And one that I'm sure is common knowledge now is that there were a series for the Satellaview, which was a Nintendo's collaboration that would bring games online through a download service.
3804017	3807578	And the first, they did these Soundlink events
3809278	3814179	And eight of these broadcasts were related to F-Zero.
3814179	3821660	So with the Soundlink event, they had four weeks worth of this.
3821660	3830782	They had Mute, Week 1 was Mute City 1, Big Blue, Death Wind 1, Silence and Sandstorm.
3830782	3834583	And then there were other ones for the next few weeks of them.
3835743	3845471	As this went out, the only one that had been dumped of these was Grand Prix 1.
3845471	3847172	But there was video out.
3847172	3860122	The video was put out by a YouTuber named Kukun Kun, who put recordings of all of the F-Zero SoundLink broadcasts.
3861306	3867739	Recorded in Japan on a Super Famicom Satellaview.
3867739	3870504	When they aired, with the audio, everything.
3870504	3871706	So the videos were there.
3872884	3901683	So what happened is that another user named Flibbity Dibbity had worked on a project for Super Mario Brothers where they called it the Living Leaderboard, where they could take people playing the game and then have all of what happened, you know, basically all of those games running simultaneously and then isolated into what the best run would be to train an AI.
3903632	3907776	He was using a tool called Graphite to train the models.
3907776	3910299	So, you know, it's tool-assisted stuff.
3910299	3919469	But another user who was inspired by that was able to reproduce the controller input sequences from Kukunkun's video.
3920570	3939259	and fed them into some sort of game logic device that would basically outline where the character was at any point and then using the VHS footage were able to recreate those tracks.
3939259	3943801	There were other artists involved who were able to recreate backgrounds.
3945041	3947382	It was some pretty amazing stuff.
3947382	3961206	And, of course, all of the... There was actually some erroneous data for the tracks that they thought they found in other games, but they turned out to be special tracks.
3961206	3965447	Some of them were in F-099.
3965447	3969909	So, they were able to get some of these items there.
3971369	3983781	And then there were also some, like, what's the word I'm thinking of, different vehicles and sprites that were in the game data for the one they were able to dump.
3983781	3985203	So, basically,
3986852	3988553	It's a mod.
3988553	3991234	At the end of the day, it's a mod.
3991234	3998298	But they were able to do as faithfully as possible.
3998298	4007122	They were able to re-release the entire Grand Prix, all four Grand Prix, for F-Zero.
4007122	4008683	I'm sorry, for B.S.
4008683	4010844	Satella View F-Zero.
4010844	4014445	And now it's out as a ROM, or a cartridge.
4016821	4021396	that is called BSF Zero Deluxe.
4025088	4027028	I have it.
4027028	4031329	Not a cartridge version, but I have the game.
4031329	4038570	But F-Zero Deluxe will have four new racing mechanics that were added in.
4038570	4042291	The new cars that came in did not replace the original four.
4042291	4049372	And so those are the Blue Thunder, Luna Bomber, Green Amazon, and Fire Scorpion, which looks very pink to me.
4049372	4053453	There are the leagues that were added to accommodate ten new tracks.
4054153	4065102	So coming from the BS ones, we have Forest 1, Big Blue 2, Sandstorm 1, Forest 2, Silence 2, and BSX League 2.
4065102	4071327	That has Mute City 4, Forest 3, Sandstorm 2, Metal Fort 1, and Metal Fort 2.
4071327	4075331	And records screens have been updated.
4075331	4078313	It's just really like the most complete one.
4078313	4081376	And I'll tell you how I found this was by watching Did You Know Gaming.
4083007	4103656	And they have a very good video about not just what went into recovering these sort of lost levels, but a little bit of the history of Nintendo's relationship that brought about the Satellaview.
4103656	4105477	So it's a really good one.
4105477	4106878	I highly recommend watching it.
4106878	4112300	And if anyone who is in chat is interested, I would gladly link this to you all at this time.
4113206	4114927	All right, let's move on.
4114927	4122772	This is some pretty big news that kind of slipped in throughout the week and all the rumors and stuff, but this is a very big deal in the making, right, Loki?
4135399	4143645	Yeah, Disney's going to be partnering, or they're developing, I guess, a new persistent universe with Epic Games.
4143645	4145166	They're going to be partnering with them.
4145166	4149649	It's a $1.5 billion investment.
4149649	4163519	And basically saying that our exciting relationship with Epic Games will bring together Disney's beloved franchises and brands with hugely popular Fortnite and a transformational new game and entertainment universe.
4164912	4166153	So, that's
4180129	4181330	Disney, Disney Fortnite
4210789	4212510	Fortnite Fortnite Fortnite
4228880	4231703	not quite so Minecraft, but it is definitely.
4231703	4232523	Yeah, I understand.
4232523	4237448	I got more like Dragon Quest Builders kind of vibe out of it, but it's it's fun.
4237448	4238248	I liked it.
4238248	4241191	So, yeah, I think you'll like League of Fortnite.
4241963	4242784	No, I'm sure it would.
4242784	4243284	Yeah.
4243284	4254355	So I'm very curious to see what Disney and Fortnite kind of come up with with this because you know, we already see some type of like, everybody in the same universe between Dreamlight Valley and Speedstorm.
4254355	4257819	We already have kind of seen like, you know, Disney worlds colliding.
4257819	4259720	It's gonna be very, very interesting.
4259720	4262103	I'm, I'm very curious to see where this goes.
4262887	4269510	Yeah, I'm curious to see how they what they do to kind of push it to something different.
4269510	4278735	I mean, it's kind of funny, like, because, you know, there's the whole metaverse trying to create their like or meta trying to create the metaverse stuff.
4278735	4284017	But it's like, I think Fortnite is pulling it off a lot better already.
4284017	4286799	And I mean, they're not even calling it like metaverse because it's
4288149	4290351	And PlayStation Home, where the hell are you?
4290351	4291191	Now's the time to strike, Sony!
4301857	4302758	Welcome to
4321770	4323090	Fortnite has shown its hand as a gaming platform.
4342196	4343016	Thank you for watching!
4361129	4365391	I say that and drop $10 on the Ariana Grande skin, so I have no room to talk.
4365391	4378337	Anyway, all right, let's move on and talk about how the FTC still is trying to do something about this whole Microsoft and Activision Blizzard merger.
4378337	4383399	And yeah, no, this isn't stopped because now that Microsoft laid off 1900 people,
4385120	4392144	The Federal Trade Commission is coming in and saying, Microsoft, you are contradicting what you promised to do.
4392144	4402670	So the FTC actually went so far as to file a complaint in appeals court this week saying that the downsizing quote, contradicts Microsoft's representations in this proceeding.
4402670	4408533	And so they have asked for a pause in Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
4408533	4410174	How the fuck do you pause it now?
4411212	4416136	How would that even work now that 1900 people are laid off?
4416136	4420740	That would just it's so what like, I get why the FTC is pissed.
4420740	4425543	But like, wouldn't that be like more of a fine at this point or something else?
4425543	4427425	Like, I don't know.
4427425	4427605	But
4429338	4443782	Anyway, apparently FTC is saying, you know, Microsoft said it would treat Activision Blizzard as a vertical acquisition, saying there would not be a need to do layoffs, there would be no redundancies, and then of course, we all know what happened after that.
4443782	4455086	Now, Microsoft, later in the week, filed a response to the complaint, saying that there is no evidence of harm resulting from the Activision Blizzard acquisition.
4455086	4457827	I know, I thought it too, but
4458647	4471172	They're justifying it by saying this, quote, consistent with broader trends in the gaming industry, Activision was already planning on eliminating a significant number of jobs while still operating as an independent company.
4471172	4475234	The recent announcement cannot be- Yeah, I mean, it's the December firings.
4475234	4478956	Well, I will give Microsoft this.
4478956	4482237	I definitely make a face at all this, but I will say this.
4482237	4486219	We know that a good chunk of the layoffs was because they ended up canceling a game.
4487879	4496523	So Activision, I think it can be implied that Activision may have already be on the on the edge of cancelling this game anyway.
4496523	4501406	They were looking to Microsoft to save it, and Microsoft said, no, cancel it.
4501406	4511071	And so I could say I'm willing to believe Microsoft to that end, that maybe this was a game that was going to get cancelled anyway.
4511071	4515093	But it's it's so hard to predict these things, like we know nothing about it, right?
4515093	4515453	I don't know.
4516257	4523021	And like the FTC maybe look into like, I don't know, cable company monopolies instead of like this nonsense.
4523021	4532967	I mean, because honestly, like, it feels like we're wasting a lot of time, like having, you know, things about this that are... You know what the FTC needs to fucking spend their time on?
4532967	4536850	Why don't you go figure out what the fuck happened to Coyote versus Acme?
4537290	4543673	Why don't you go rip off David Zaslav's wig and tell us what's going on over there?
4543673	4544854	That's what I'd like the FTC to look at.
4558579	4565004	But I do want to be clear, to be fair, because I don't want to sound insensitive to the fact, you know, yes, 1900 people lost their jobs and that fucking sucks.
4565004	4567145	So I understand where the FTC is pissed off.
4567145	4570428	If Microsoft said, we're not going to lay people off, then they lay people off.
4570428	4571288	So I do.
4571288	4574011	I want to before I'm like, you know, FTC is wasted.
4574011	4576913	I do understand needling Microsoft on this point.
4576913	4580335	It is something worth needling and getting more explanation about.
4580335	4585900	But I'm also of the reality mindset of like, what what can you possibly do now?
4587728	4588749	The FTC ignores the reality.
4607845	4608846	Strong words.
4608846	4613189	The FTC ignores the reality that the deal itself has substantially changed.
4613189	4628779	Since the FTC lost in court last July, Microsoft was required by UK competition authority to restructure the acquisition globally and therefore did not acquire the cloud streaming rights to Activision Blizzard games in the United States.
4628779	4636865	Additionally, Sony and Microsoft signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation on even better terms than Sony had before.
4638165	4656693	That is also a very, in light of everything we talked about at the beginning of the show, it's also very interesting that Microsoft was more than ready and willing to sign these agreements, almost as if they already knew.
4656693	4658794	Hmm.
4658794	4659274	Interesting.
4660697	4665179	Well, the plot continues to thicken on that, but I'm not sure there's much more to say.
4665179	4667759	And again, I don't know what could possibly happen from this.
4667759	4668400	What happens?
4668400	4670040	A fine or something?
4670040	4670460	I don't know.
4670460	4671681	We'll see.
4671681	4674142	They should take it out of Bobby Kotick's severance.
4674142	4675242	Can they still do that?
4675242	4676022	I think they should.
4676022	4677763	They could take it out of his ass.
4677763	4678503	I think they should.
4678503	4680284	Whatever it takes, honestly.
4680284	4682204	All right, let's move on.
4682204	4684385	DarkSakura, you have a fun story for us.
4686425	4686606	I'm
4695762	4702464	I don't know what fans like from certain dormant franchises and which ones I'd like to see back.
4702464	4709247	It's about Dino Crisis, Okami, Darkstalkers, a few more.
4709247	4717950	There's no results from it yet, but they're calling it Capcom Super Elections 10 Questions for Capcom Fans.
4717950	4721391	I will also link this in the chat room.
4721391	4722872	But yeah, I'm voting on it.
4723416	4725018	You better vote on it too.
4725018	4738692	The more votes, the betterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
4739252	4739673	Capcom
4755894	4758795	If you were a member of the cast of Capcom Delta, who cares?
4758795	4760176	Where's the fucking game list?
4760176	4760736	That's what I want.
4760736	4761136	Nope.
4761136	4762837	I think this has to do with it.
4762837	4763458	Oh, God.
4763458	4764998	All right.
4764998	4765479	Let's see.
4765479	4770961	I would be Walking Assistant Robot because my vote is going to absolutely be for Mega Man Legends.
4770961	4773362	If you could learn one special move, what would it be?
4773362	4779225	I'm going to say Hadouken because I think about that when we saw that Mega Man Universe game, how we saw Ryu in that game.
4780186	4785630	and then let's see, Iona 5, a 4, a Switch, Series S, iOS, Steam.
4785630	4787951	Wow, the only thing I don't have is Android.
4787951	4792295	Okay, region is United States.
4792295	4794036	Do I really have to answer all this?
4794036	4796978	Date of birth, I'm going to lie.
4796978	4800000	So sorry for those that are trying to track me here.
4800000	4801521	I'm going to lie.
4801521	4804964	All right, gender, other, because non-binary people are bad.
4804964	4806085	I like that they're providing other.
4806724	4821717	all right email address required stop this spam bull shit at now.com okay perfect create a card I got wallpaper God
4823576	4826137	Oh, cards can be downloaded from the email you receive.
4826137	4826417	Oops.
4826417	4828078	Well, I won't be getting that.
4828078	4829039	Okay.
4829039	4829799	Do I get to vote?
4829799	4830219	All right.
4830219	4834001	So now that gets you into the election venue on the website.
4834001	4834902	Okay, here we go.
4834902	4835642	Oh, there's Chun Li.
4835642	4836883	Looks like she won a beauty prize.
4836883	4837563	Okay.
4837563	4841045	Which of the following Capcom games do you like the best?
4841045	4842225	Oh, this is hard.
4842225	4843526	Rival Schools.
4843526	4845587	Well, what I like- It's the Japanese.
4845587	4850170	Can I say Mega Man instead of Rival Schools?
4850170	4852050	No.
4852050	4853031	I don't put Rival Schools.
4854983	4858105	But I'm lying.
4858105	4859405	Okay, then what?
4859405	4863787	Who is your favorite Capcom character?
4863787	4864508	I don't know.
4864508	4865908	Who is my favorite Capcom character?
4865908	4869010	Tron Bon I do like Tron Bon.
4869010	4869970	I'll go with that.
4869970	4870971	That's a good answer.
4870971	4872151	Okay.
4872151	4875293	Um, what do you look for in Capcom games?
4876445	4878246	Please select up to three.
4878246	4879646	This is the most boring radio.
4879646	4886089	I thought we were going to get to just answer the fucking question on what we were going to get to see.
4886089	4886429	All right.
4886429	4887610	I'm just going to finish this later.
4887610	4889670	I thought we were actually going to get to a list of games.
4889670	4891251	I'm doing it right now.
4891251	4892452	All right, fine.
4892452	4896473	And then when you're done with that, you have to vote for the new Whopper.
4896473	4896933	Oh, my God.
4896933	4900295	What image do you have of Capcom and one of their selections is weird in a good way.
4902515	4904956	Their HQ is in Japan.
4904956	4906277	All right.
4906277	4913722	Let's move on and talk about this next story with From Software.
4913722	4918304	I think it's funny, though, that they acquired Acquire because it makes for a great headline.
4918304	4919365	It does make for a great headline.
4920510	4932617	But yes, FromSoftware, their parent company has now acquired the studio that they put out Octopath Traveler as well as other games.
4932617	4934458	So, that's cool.
4934458	4940241	I mean, was it No Heroes Allowed VR, Akiba's Beat, Akiba's Trip?
4942262	4944324	They're a smaller, I think, Japanese company.
4944324	4948888	But yeah, Octopath Traveler 2 coming, you know, came out last year.
4948888	4954654	I don't know what other games they have kind of similar that coming out soon, but... Neat, yeah.
4954654	4956816	I don't know what that necessarily means.
4956816	4960219	They're gonna generate synergies.
4960219	4961120	That's what they put in there.
4961120	4966826	They literally put the office buzzwords.
4966826	4967026	Neat.
4967785	4967905	I'm
4984321	4985122	Triangle Strategy
5005663	5007205	They're not as diversifying.
5007205	5008566	They're diversifying.
5008566	5015974	They're going to generate those synergies with existing game related subsidiaries.
5015974	5017316	Oh, boy.
5017316	5017976	All right.
5017976	5021020	I love I love when they throw in all the corporate buzzwords in there.
5021348	5022808	Yeah, you got to love it.
5022808	5044375	Well, speaking of corporate buzzwords, if you want to if you want to see some corporate smoke blown up your fucking ass this week, look no further than what Ubisoft has had to say about the price tag of Skull and Bones, a $70 price tag game, even though there are live service elements that you would expect to see in something a lot cheaper.
5044375	5048836	They are calling the game a quadruple A game.
5048836	5049557	Boo.
5049557	5050397	Yves Gilman.
5051991	5061938	who we could say a lot about, but tonight we're just going to keep it to the fact that he has said that you will see that Skull & Bones is a fully-fledged game.
5061938	5063579	I'm trying to see where he said this.
5063579	5066421	It was a Q&A session in an earnings call.
5066421	5072345	It's a very big game, and we feel that people will really see how vast and complete that game is.
5072345	5077089	It's really a full, triple, quadruple-A game that will deliver in the long run.
5078823	5082665	I need to put a trigger warning in front of what I'm about to say.
5082665	5085767	Because honest to God, I thought Trump said this.
5085767	5090010	Because it reads like a fucking Trump quote.
5090010	5092772	Let me read that one more time, and I want you to picture him saying it.
5094278	5097463	You will see that Skull & Bones is a fully-fledged game.
5097463	5103092	It's a very big game, and we feel that people will really see how vast and complete that game is.
5103092	5108500	It's really, it's full, triple, quadruple A game, and it will deliver in the long run.
5109542	5110102	I'm sorry
5129016	5131217	Quintuple A game would be.
5131217	5140821	And Skulls and Bones, you know, that those are parts of the body and therefore it's a full bodied game.
5140821	5151345	And I feel that you should all go out there and purchase it and then give us more money with our live service game that we totally won't shut down in a few years once it doesn't do as well.
5151345	5155867	And I'm sure that the game will come out buggy or anything and that it won't be like, you know,
5156447	5157308	It's a perfect game.
5157308	5158329	It's a perfect game.
5158329	5159971	It's an excellent health.
5159971	5160852	It's Doctor Said So.
5160852	5162233	I hate every minute of this segment.
5162233	5162794	It's a genius game.
5177352	5180453	I had to identify, they gave me a test.
5180453	5182814	I had to identify five things they wanted me to remember.
5182814	5186916	It was, um, man, woman, pirate, ship, whale.
5186916	5191098	And so I had to repeat it back and it was, you know, they said I was super smart.
5191098	5194779	I answered it better than anybody in the has ever answered it.
5194779	5197420	And so therefore that game is going to be perfect.
5197420	5201442	Perfect game.
5201442	5203503	Please do not compare us with that thing, PodCulture.
5205854	5208015	We are Orange Lounge, not Spray Tan Lounge.
5208015	5209836	That's a bannable comment, PodCulture.
5209836	5213257	You better watch yourself.
5213257	5220580	If we were still on IRC, this is where you would get slapped with a large fish, for those that remember that reference of the old MIRC.
5220580	5228424	I would absolutely- wait, slash me slaps PodCulture with a large trout.
5228424	5229764	Wow, it worked.
5229764	5230885	It showed up in a teller.
5233306	5234927	Okay, perfect.
5234927	5238929	Anyway, um, where was I?
5238929	5239550	Uh, let's see.
5239550	5245953	Oh, DarkTetsuya, who we need to hear DarkTetsuya's opinion because he's actually played it.
5245953	5247294	So because of the beta.
5247294	5248434	So here's the comment.
5248434	5261101	I played in the beta and thought it was fun, but wouldn't go so far as to say it was quadruple A. Oh, we have YsGomont responding to DarkTetsuya in the chat with the following comment.
5261101	5261662	Wrong.
5263743	5278588	No, this is the, it's quadruple A because the sound you make playing is... Anyway, Skull & Bones comes out on February 16th for 70 bucks.
5278588	5290472	And if you order the $100 Premium Edition, the very, this is for very good, very good supporters, very good people that are going to buy this Premium Edition game.
5290472	5291392	Very fine people.
5292851	5303637	You'll get two extra missions, cosmetic items, and a smuggler pass token to unlock the premium battle pass, whatever the fuck that means.
5303637	5306819	Oh, because of course there's a battle pass on top of this.
5306819	5314204	But two extra missions, so that doesn't sound like that I'm getting the full game for the $70.
5314204	5320628	I mean, essentially this game is just, you know, Assassin's Creed Black Flag Part 2, right?
5320628	5320908	I mean,
5322304	5322865	Here's the thing.
5333618	5338021	I'm just getting I how do I say this nicely without offending somebody?
5338021	5339002	Don't be nice.
5339002	5339822	Don't preorder games.
5339822	5342144	I'm getting big Starfield vibes from this.
5342144	5345066	I'm getting big Starfield vibes from this.
5345066	5347388	And you can read into that comment however you like.
5347388	5349449	And if that hurts your feelings, sorry about it.
5349449	5351631	But I'm getting big Starfield vibes from this.
5351631	5356174	That's all I have to say.
5356174	5358636	Anyhow, you know what I'm getting from this?
5358636	5358836	What?
5360305	5360766	Jack shit.
5385970	5393735	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5393735	5398279	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5398279	5406905	And you know, just to quickly say, you know what I get for talking shit is a little bit of that Skull and Bones music just peaked through on the feed while I was running the bumper there.
5406905	5410707	So I apologize for the inconvenience at this time.
5410707	5412128	Anyhow, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week.
5412128	5412869	DarkSakura, what'd you pick?
5413919	5419622	The classic game is Linkle Liver Story.
5419622	5423564	1986, developed by Nextech and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn.
5423564	5425825	It is an action RPG.
5425825	5429786	You play a fox girl named Kitsch.
5429786	5432248	As in kitschy.
5432248	5439311	So basically, you get your weapons and stuff in really interesting ways because you have to find seeds and plant them.
5440071	5442972	and then you get them from whatever grew.
5442972	5464639	It is a 2D fully, you know, one of those beautiful Sega Saturn games that shows off just exactly how great it was at 2D graphics, how much more lush the colors and everything were than the 2D games that came out on PlayStation.
5465959	5475884	But you're in a world called Mamuna, and it's inhabited by demi-humans, so, you know, kind of like... It's inhabited by furries, so they're furries.
5475884	5484828	And they're ruled by this guy named Mumma, who uses dark magic and is an authoritarian, of course.
5484828	5490630	But when his powers are waning, he has to find a new source of power, and so...
5492771	5499539	You play Kitsch, who is joining forces with the other Woodland Animals to try to fight back.
5499539	5504024	So she's joined by a Skrull named Ballel and a Rabbit named Lalala.
5504898	5513160	And then her third partner is called Puchimuku, which is a seed that grows throughout the game.
5513160	5525184	And the game was originally supposed to be called RagnaSenti 2 and was supposed to be a sequel to the original RagnaSenti, which was also Crusader of Senti and Soleil.
5526524	5538554	But the company that did this Next Tech, some of the things they were responsible for was, like I said, Crusader of Senti and Ranger X for the Sega Saturn.
5539713	5543216	I mean, not Saturn, but the Genesis or Mega Drive.
5543216	5548440	This was released on March 15, 1996 for Saturn.
5548440	5554586	And it was only released in Japan, but it does have an English translation, which you can find.
5554586	5558028	And the same team that did the game translation also translated the manual.
5560510	5567673	According to Famitsu, Link O'Liver's story sold almost 5,000 copies in its first week.
5567673	5574556	It was given a 26 out of 40, so not like a glowing review, but for Famitsu, that's nice.
5574556	5579138	So it got pretty average ratings, but I think it's just a cute little game.
5579138	5580058	It really is.
5580058	5581439	It's definitely a unique one.
5585663	5594166	They were, it had been misromanized though when they were first publishing stuff about it as Wrinkle River Story.
5594166	5598247	But no, the game title literally says Wrinkle Liver.
5598247	5601108	So that's the game.
5601108	5602129	It's cute, isn't it?
5602129	5603389	Isn't it pretty?
5603389	5607051	I'm getting big Secret of Mana vibes from it in a way, like the way the graphics are.
5607051	5609892	And I admit, I don't know a lot about this game, but it looks really cute.
5609892	5610932	Like I would try this for sure.
5612845	5613805	Oh, well, who knows?
5613805	5617947	Maybe, maybe I'll leave the Super Nintendo realm and move on to the Sega Saturn realm.
5617947	5618267	We'll see.
5618267	5620407	Because I do still want to play through Grandia again.
5620407	5621168	Yeah.
5621168	5625209	But um, but yeah, Link will, Link will live her story.
5625209	5626729	You play as furries.
5626729	5627350	The end.
5627350	5630230	I was on that front, DarkSakura, do what's fun.
5630230	5632931	That always, that always should be the answer to any question you're asking.
5632931	5633631	Do what's fun.
5633631	5634752	Do what's gonna motivate you, you know?
5635632	5636693	That's my thought anyway.
5636693	5638653	Like, Oh, do you want to go to work?
5638653	5640254	Or do you want to stay in bed?
5640254	5641234	Okay, fun.
5641234	5643435	Maybe that doesn't work every situation.
5643435	5646797	But all right.
5646797	5648097	No.
5648097	5648638	There you go.
5648638	5650999	Well, remember, without the paycheck, you can't pay for fun.
5650999	5652819	So think of it as an investment.
5652819	5653980	It's an investment in your fun.
5654895	5656636	All right.
5656636	5657757	We have a few more headlines.
5657757	5661879	We didn't have actually a lot of news this week because people won't shut up about Microsoft.
5661879	5663640	So it's kind of stifled the news this week.
5663640	5666481	But we still have- Or the stupor bowl.
5666481	5671624	We still have a few quick headlines to get to and some maybe last minute stories.
5671624	5679148	And of course, your comments and questions in our listener roundtable, maybe even some calls over on our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5679148	5682470	But first, let's do some rapid fire news and some quick headlines.
5682470	5682670	Loki.
5684174	5694945	So apparently it's been leaked who one of the upcoming DLC characters is going to be in the new Suicide Squad game and that is Mr. Freeze.
5694945	5696967	How'd that get leaked out?
5696967	5705135	Well by the game itself actually because apparently a voice line in the game from Brainiac as he's talking to the main characters there was
5706036	5706537	and Harley Quinn.
5727771	5731093	I mean, this is a live service game, by the way.
5731093	5738956	This is what you get with a live service game where it's just like perpetually going.
5738956	5740557	All we know is companies are greedy.
5740557	5742818	That's why they have live service games.
5742818	5746280	So I guess we'll expect Mr. Freeze to be coming at some point.
5746280	5750322	The industry is killing itself on this live service shit.
5751178	5754521	If they're going all in and they're going to find out that's a mistake.
5754521	5757144	So we'll see what happens.
5757144	5763830	Because I mean, if you think about it, let's imagine for a second here, 95 live service games are coming.
5763830	5769996	You do realize that people have, there are first off, a finite number of people in the world.
5769996	5773459	And those people have a finite amount of time.
5773459	5773619	And
5774600	5777842	To play a live service game, you can only play one at a time.
5777842	5781725	So how is a person going to play 95 of these games?
5781725	5785147	So the vast majority of them are going to fail.
5785147	5787188	It is just math.
5787188	5788970	That's just how it works.
5788970	5792392	You have to you have to look at the parallels to the movie industry as well.
5792392	5796495	Not that the movies ever tried necessarily live service and that whole thing.
5796495	5799577	But not every movie necessitates merchandising.
5800933	5803034	Merchandising, merchandising.
5803034	5810879	But in all seriousness, if you were to try to merchandise every movie that was ever made out there, you're gonna end up with a lot of crap in a landfill.
5810879	5813160	Not everything lends itself to that.
5813160	5818744	And not every video game is suddenly going to be something people want to pony up extra money for some will be
5819909	5822831	But that's going to be the same stuff that drives movies.
5822831	5826172	There's talent involved like Hideo Kojima, like him or not.
5826172	5828034	His name is always going to sell a game.
5828034	5843502	Potentially voice acting talent as well, which is why I've said for a long time, one of the best ways we can counter AI in this industry is to lift up art directors and artists that contribute to games and, you know, recognize their work and buy, you know, based on the artists that we see involved with games.
5845263	5858593	and or it's a long standing series like a Final Fantasy or whatever it is that you know is able to sell on names like a lot of movies do like Twister can sell a whole new movie apparently because people just remember the cow scene.
5858593	5867219	So I feel like there's a lot again comparing with movies here and the game industry is going to learn this the hard way.
5867219	5868320	And they already are.
5868320	5868760	What do you think?
5868760	5870201	Why do you think these layoffs are happening?
5873641	5883909	And then, speaking of, well, you mentioned Final Fantasy, but Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to the Xbox platforms as well.
5883909	5890734	And along with that, we found out that it's going to require players to have a Game Pass subscription in order to
5891434	5892895	Play the game itself.
5908889	5914011	Final Fantasy 11, like way back in the day, didn't even require you to have Xbox Live Gold at the time.
5914011	5914392	Correct.
5914392	5916332	So somebody fucked up.
5916332	5917873	It should not be this way.
5917873	5927017	Somebody fucked up and needs to fix it because the entire Final Fantasy community is looking at this going, wow, way to shoot the Xbox release in the foot.
5927017	5928198	Excellent job.
5928198	5932760	And especially with all this other stuff going on about Microsoft right now, this is not the PR they need.
5932760	5935201	So somebody needs to fix this post haste.
5937679	5938760	Yeah.
5938760	5942985	So well, at least there's other platforms to play it on.
5942985	5950252	PC, for example, PlayStation without PlayStation, PlayStation, or PlayStation Gold or whatever the fuck they call it these days.
5950252	5953796	PlayStation Plus, Plus Gold, Premium Plus, Plus Cloud Plus.
5953796	5956099	Anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5958733	5960295	Oh, just EVO stuff.
5960295	5963557	So they have announced the lineup for EVO.
5963557	5975646	And it looks like it's going to be Street Fighter VI, Tekken 8, Guilty Gear, Granblue Fantasy versus... It's really tiny.
5975646	5977068	Oh, you know, I can just read the actual text.
5977868	5978709	I'll start over.
5978709	5991256	Mortal Kombat 1, Street Fighter VI, Tekken 8, Guilty Gear Strive, King of Fighters XV, Granblue Fantasy vs. Rising, Under Night In-Birth 2, Sisselis, and Street Fighter III Third Strike.
5991256	5993418	Hmm.
5993418	5995119	Guess what's not on the list?
5995119	5995659	Melee!
5998244	6021610	Well, I mean that's I don't think that's ever gonna be on the list because they don't like modded Melee and Nintendo's doing their own thing with smash It's gonna happen on July 19th through the 21st in Las Vegas I recommend do not use any of the ride-sharing at all And be prepared to spend a lot of money on food.
6021610	6027051	Pray that there's no Formula One construction going on around that time God, that's still gonna be going on, you know
6029672	6031193	It's so upsetting.
6031193	6031573	All right.
6031573	6042716	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about this story, which is that Super Mario RPG on the Nintendo Switch has now outsold the original.
6042716	6050658	I kind of find this fascinating, but apparently Super Mario RPG in its original run sold 2.14 million units.
6050658	6054579	And now, thanks to Nintendo's fiscal report, quarter three for 2024,
6055618	6059883	Super Mario RPG has hit 3.14 million units.
6059883	6061645	Hey, that's pi.
6061645	6066510	So yeah, Super Mario RPG is outsold the original by a million, the remake on the Switch.
6066510	6068112	You know what this means?
6068112	6070014	Sequel!
6070014	6070835	I hope so.
6070835	6076762	Gosh, I'm... You think I'm joke, but I... Who would want to see a sequel to the remake?
6078361	6079502	I would absolutely love it.
6079502	6082683	I bought the remake, but I haven't I haven't played it yet.
6082683	6088627	My kid, I bought it for my son, but I do want to play it because I love the game.
6088627	6089567	It's a great game.
6089567	6091068	It's just.
6091068	6094810	Yeah, I mean, I would absolutely play a sequel.
6094810	6095970	Yeah.
6095970	6097291	I hope that's where this is headed.
6097291	6097951	I really do.
6097951	6098452	I really do.
6098452	6098872	But we'll see.
6100248	6104852	All right, with that being said, let's check out some games that you can play this week.
6104852	6109715	You'll be playing it a little sooner than a sequel to that game as we look at some world release dates.
6109715	6112597	And we will start in the U.S., Loki.
6112597	6116981	All right, well, in the U.S., we've got a few things.

6214691	6218814	Skull and Bones, that $70 quadruple A game.
6218814	6223719	Gotta go buy it on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
6223719	6224619	And that's it.
6224619	6227862	I mean, honestly, that's the only game you need, right?
6227862	6234909	Quadruple A. Can't argue with those facts.
6234909	6235129	Well,
6235774	6237296	All right.
6237296	6243846	Sorry, I was just reacting to the news and chat about the little football game and realizing I'm gonna have pissed off coworkers tomorrow.
6243846	6244507	Fantastic.
6244507	6245348	All right.
6245348	6252098	Anyway, um, let's move on and talk about what is happening in Japan and the releases there.
6253732	6256833	Gunvolt Records Cycronical
6271465	6273666	Looks like it might be fun.
6273666	6274706	Check that out.
6274706	6283209	Also coming out, we have The Legend of Heroes Trails Through Daybreak on the Nintendo Switch, as well as Front Mission 2 getting a remake.
6283209	6286670	Mario vs. Donkey Kong also releases in Japan.
6286670	6291092	Hint, it's worldwide on February 16th, just like it is releasing here.
6291092	6294033	Checking out the PlayStation 5 for a minute.
6294033	6297574	That same Gunvolt Records is coming out as well on PlayStation 5.
6299355	6304297	and Cyberpunk 2077 gets a Japanese release, multi-language.
6304297	6308339	I think it's an Ultimate Edition though, so I think this is a re-release also coming out this week.
6308339	6315543	And hey, if you would like to get skull and bones, you want to participate in the quadruple A madness, guess what?
6315543	6320685	The Regular and Premium Edition also headed to Japan.
6320685	6325908	So you all don't get to miss out on paying way too much money for a live service game.
6325908	6326108	Fun.
6327352	6332234	Alright, moving on, DarkSakura, what's coming out in the UK?
6332234	6338076	So on the 13th for PlayStation, we have Ultros Deluxe Edition.
6338076	6342197	On PlayStation and Xbox, we have Banishers, Ghosts of New Eden.

6354361	6357462	Hubris, Mario vs Donkey Kong, Xbox and PlayStation, Skull & Crossbones
6371992	6376535	Well, with that, we are actually at the end of all of our scheduled stories tonight.
6376535	6378496	So we'll open up the listener roundtable.
6378496	6385199	If you have any questions in our chat or something you'd like for us to talk about, put that on in over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6385199	6392203	I know we have less folks tonight than we usually do because you know, there's yay sports going on on TV.
6392203	6395065	Or as I like to say, yay appetizers and food.
6395065	6398847	That's the best part of anything on this day is all the food that people make because people go crazy.
6400208	6403530	But also Bobby Blackwolf, of course, wasn't on tonight either.
6403530	6406832	So it's just us holding it down here at VOG Network.
6406832	6410955	As a reminder, we will be here next week.
6410955	6412997	We will not be here in two weeks.
6412997	6419622	And that was already planned and already factors into the April 14th equation for our thousandth episode.
6419622	6423704	That was the pre-planned week I'm going to have off because I'm going to be on a cruise.
6424608	6429292	As I've talked about before on the show, the Star Trek cruise, so won't be here that weekend.
6429292	6435357	I know that's a very random weekend at the end of February, but life, it happens and goes on.
6435357	6439020	So I don't know if DarkSakura will be streaming or something, or if Loki will be up to no good.
6439020	6439461	Probably will.
6440181	6441042	Thank you for watching!
6459875	6460415	Well, there's that.
6460415	6465279	I will also invite you if you want to join our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6465279	6469802	And if you want to give us a call, you can hop in the green room, which I think is still there.
6469802	6471783	Oh, I didn't even see somebody's waiting in there.
6471783	6477106	I did not scroll down far enough on my computer to see what there's nothing in the mailbox.
6477106	6477327	So
6478530	6483152	Well, not the sad music.
6483152	6484533	Turn it off.
6484533	6489295	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6489295	6491556	Hey, but at least we get to take a phone call.
6491556	6492236	Let's do it.
6492236	6493717	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
6493717	6498999	Who's this?
6498999	6500480	Hola.
6500480	6502441	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6502441	6503901	Is that Ranma?
6503901	6505042	What the heck?
6505042	6505682	Can you hear us?
6505682	6507343	Because we can hear you swearing over there.
6509082	6511403	Uh oh, his brain just exploded.
6511403	6512884	I cannot hear anybody.
6512884	6515645	What the heck is going on here?
6515645	6517505	I am so sorry, okay?
6517505	6518326	I can't hear anybody.
6518326	6521947	I don't know what the heck's going on.
6521947	6524888	I'm gonna mess around with my settings.
6524888	6525909	I honestly don't know.
6525909	6527950	Get your thought out.
6527950	6528930	There we go.
6528930	6531171	I don't know what the heck is going on with my computer today.
6532560	6533401	Okay.
6533401	6534341	Yeah.
6534341	6536342	Loki said this is what you get for watching sports.
6536342	6537743	All right.
6537743	6545347	Well, I'm only a sports fan when there are certain teams involved or just because.
6545347	6545788	That's all.
6545788	6548970	And you were down for the 40 whiners?
6548970	6551211	I have a specific reason for that.
6551211	6552592	Okay.
6552592	6554393	Okay.
6554393	6560016	A close friend of mine is because his father was a big 49ers fan and he lost his father a few years back.
6560016	6561637	So I'm like a support bro for him.
6563177	6564418	Okay, that's fair.
6564418	6565659	But I just want a chicken wing.
6565659	6566519	All right.
6566519	6571923	Hey, I had I had spinach dip and that makes me happy.
6571923	6574404	Yeah, today is not it's not Super Bowl Sunday.
6574404	6576746	It's national seven layer bean dip day.
6576746	6578027	Just so we're clear.
6578027	6580648	All right.
6580648	6584251	It's the Super Bowl when you eat yourself into a stupor.
6584251	6584871	All good.
6584871	6587433	All that crap aside, Ranma, what is really on your mind tonight?
6588214	6595771	Alright, I figured I'd call in and kinda give like a brief explanation about my cameo appearance and I want to say something about Microsoft and all of that.
6595936	6596557	Yes, please.
6596557	6600040	First, I want to explain for the podcast listeners, Ranma has an amazing shirt on tonight.
6600040	6606566	It's a Dr. Mario shirt, and he's holding his thumb up, and he has this, like, A expression.
6606566	6608548	Almost looks like Fonzie from Happy Days.
6608548	6611871	Yes, I know that reference is dated, but, like, Dr. Mario is that.
6611871	6612752	It looks really good.
6612752	6614554	Oh, is it a house parody?
6614554	6615195	Or Breaking Bad?
6615195	6615895	Yes, it is.
6615895	6617297	Oh, it's a house parody.
6617297	6618938	That's what it is.
6618938	6619519	Oh, okay.
6619519	6619959	I get it now.
6620942	6622123	All right.
6622123	6625846	I'm a little slow, but thank you for explaining the joke to me.
6625846	6631490	All right, Ranma, you want to comment on your appearance on national television?
6631490	6636434	Yeah, and I want to say the anniversary of that taping is coming up in like three days.
6636434	6641358	This all happened on Valentine's Day, like six, seven years ago.
6641358	6642719	I don't know exactly the date.
6642719	6646842	Do you know how many years ago, here come my quotey fingers, I was on Drag Race, quotey fingers?
6648732	6649914	Thanks for watching!
6665566	6679550	Alright, to summarize, a former friend asked me and a few others to travel up to Philly for the taping because she has these- she had these keloids on her ears and nobody wanted to touch them.
6679550	6680411	Nobody.
6680411	6684952	So she wrote to Dr. Pimple and hopes as to be the savior.
6684952	6689834	And- Dr. Lee is a good person, okay?
6689834	6690434	Definitely.
6691465	6702747	So, she got picked, and asked me and a couple of people, and I'm like, well, I'm single on Valentine's Day, I ain't going anywhere, I'll hop a Greyhound bus and go to Philly for the day, why not?
6702747	6717471	And since they kinda themed it as we're all cosplayers hanging out and stuff like that, and that's what we did, I showed up as Ayuigi, which is actually Luigi, but they had to put tape over the L so that they wouldn't get CND'd by Nintendo.
6722559	6728225	If you watch the episode, you'll see me sitting there and you'll see tape on my head that looks like an eye.
6728225	6735532	And don't watch the clip version that's online because it doesn't show you at all.
6735532	6738535	Watch it on the app.
6738535	6739156	And that's all there is.
6739156	6741158	I was just there as a support friend.
6742864	6744445	Just agreeing along with everything.
6744445	6747426	I think I said something but probably got cut at the end.
6747426	6754250	I can say that he had the surgery done and it's been several years and they have not grown back.
6754250	6760573	That's actually really good because chelids are notorious for growing back.
6760573	6762834	So what was the other topic you wanted to talk to us about tonight, Ranma?
6764813	6766373	Let's talk Microsoft for a second.
6766373	6768894	I'm going to put this out there for those of you who don't know.
6768894	6771395	I'm a former Microsoft employee.
6771395	6776078	There are things that go along back there that do make sense, but at the same time does not.
6776078	6779279	Now, I can say this.
6779279	6784001	As long as there is Windows, there will be a Microsoft Surface.
6784001	6788523	As long as there is a Game Pass, there will always be an Xbox.
6788523	6792445	Everybody freaking out that Microsoft is going through
6793888	6797150	Does it matter if they do or not?
6797150	6799312	It's not a big deal.
6799312	6805156	There are people like me who have PlayStation for some games and Xbox for other games.
6805156	6806277	And I know the whole thing.
6806277	6807418	Why get an Xbox?
6807418	6809059	You have a PC.
6809059	6813422	I don't game on my PC outside of PSO2 New Genesis.
6813422	6817345	My PC is a studio PC for streaming and editing and all of that.
6818871	6820811	Quick Roundup Broforce, you know?
6820811	6821632	I'm like that.
6821632	6823272	I am not the only person.
6823272	6826113	So, people need to chill and relax.
6826113	6834955	And also, with Game Pass, Microsoft needs a platform to show it what it can do.
6834955	6837855	That's why there will always be an Xbox.
6837855	6840696	And I know some people are thinking, you can do it on PC.
6840696	6840776	No.
6841701	6844662	The Surface is to show off what Windows can do.
6844662	6845943	That's what that's for.
6845943	6849425	That's part of the reason why Microsoft created Surface.
6849425	6855588	That and they got kind of a little butthurt over Apple and iPod and all that stuff, which is understandable.
6855588	6857549	But, is there a Game Pass?
6858968	6876099	You know, there's actually a big, there is a big part of this that you bring up, Ranma, that I do kind of agree with when it comes to Xbox, is that I actually think, you know, and again, it's really weird to talk about this because we just don't fucking know and the news that comes out this next week might blow this whole thing up, but my gut tells me, if nothing else,
6877276	6899164	that if Microsoft were to keep making consoles they might lean into Series S and what that means because I get this feeling that Series S may be coming through for them in a way that maybe X didn't quite do and maybe Microsoft sees a way to sort of position a low-cost alternative device
6899864	6905607	to the PlayStation 5 as something that can be like that gateway, especially what we're talking about.
6905607	6913210	Video games are fucking expensive, especially now you got quadruple A games coming out at a hundred dollar edition with extra shit.
6913210	6920133	Maybe Microsoft wants to put something out there that is like, this is the cheap way to get into playing Game Pass games.
6920133	6927237	And we've seen them kind of needle at this strategy before with the whole, like, remember when they were doing like cell phone style contracts
6927677	6933418	for an Xbox Series S and two years of Game Pass, and then you get that for the monthly fee and all that stuff.
6933418	6948461	So I could see where maybe Microsoft and Xbox, maybe they stopped trying to push the limits of what is technically possible and all this, and they start to scale back to what is the low cost way to put gaming in every home.
6948461	6950602	I could see that being the strategy here.
6952097	6953200	And you're right.
6953200	6960219	Now, part of the issue, without getting too technical, is that, yes, the series S and X are the same, but yet different.
6961277	6965640	You can't play an X game on the S unless it's from the cloud, which makes sense.
6965640	6969922	But for some people, playing in the cloud is slow and choppy, which I get.
6969922	6981990	The coding behind the Series S is slightly different from the X, which is why developers have issues for doing stuff for the S. And I do understand why it sells more, because of the price point.
6981990	6985672	What Microsoft should do... Well, and not everything S is on cloud.
6985672	6986953	Actually, very little of it is.
6986953	6989795	It just, it runs things at lower resolutions and worse frame rate.
6990535	6991597	That's basically what it is.
7001627	7005850	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7027728	7031769	The Xbox is about to disrupt this whole thing with a new console.
7031769	7034570	And that console is what you just said.
7034570	7043092	It's going to be a Series X powered machine with a few of the things stripped out of it at the price of a Series S this far now.
7043092	7043552	That right.
7043552	7046473	They have a digital only Series X coming out here pretty soon.
7046473	7047813	They've already shown that.
7047813	7048273	Yeah.
7048273	7049993	And it's supposed to be two terabytes.
7049993	7053054	And I know they upped the Series S with one terabyte.
7053054	7055095	They announced that in black.
7055095	7056215	And so many people are like,
7056974	7058855	We didn't ask for this.
7058855	7060796	We did not ask for this.
7060796	7064959	Because, as, that Series S is underpowered.
7064959	7072203	I mean, it can't even play Xbox One X games properly because of the memory constraints.
7072203	7072864	And that's sad.
7076818	7078379	It's, it's gonna be interesting to see.
7078379	7083163	But but again, yeah, it's like, it's one of these whole, like, I just, I just got to wait like four or five more days.
7083163	7084784	And we'll finally have these answers.
7084784	7090008	And we can actually have a conversation about is this really the disruption everyone's making it out to be?
7090008	7091429	Or is this not?
7091429	7099295	Or it's, okay, Microsoft's putting some of their games that didn't do as well as expected the first time on the PS5 to try to find a new audience.
7099295	7101617	Because, because keep in mind, that could just be what this is.
7103015	7110837	That could just very well be what this is, is that it's just Microsoft is going to put their games on more platforms when they don't do well on Xbox out the gate.
7110837	7111938	That's all.
7111938	7112578	Yeah.
7112578	7116999	And again, you have the Microsoft fanboys losing their crap over it.
7116999	7118760	The Sony fanboys losing it.
7118760	7121021	I'm like, who hurt you?
7121021	7121781	Really?
7121781	7127703	I mean, yeah, if it doesn't cost a lot of money to port the game over, like, why wouldn't you want it on more platforms?
7127703	7130424	Like, especially if it doesn't perform as well as you'd hoped it would.
7131958	7137463	The issue is, between that, those are people that are still pushing for a console war.
7137463	7147010	There has not been a console war since Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, and I will die on that damn hill.
7147010	7152594	Well... I-I know, I know.
7152594	7155817	There have been others, but I'm just saying, the most memorable one.
7155817	7157959	I mean, there was a documentary about it!
7157959	7160080	There was the Dreamcast and the PS2, so bang.
7167709	7180576	I mean, look, we're at the point where Nintendo is doing their thing.
7180576	7183237	Sony is doing their thing.
7183237	7184938	Microsoft is doing their thing.
7184938	7188060	They're all being nice, nice on social media.
7188060	7189901	They're not slandering each other.
7189901	7190981	They're just being chill.
7190981	7192182	It's like a different
7192987	7195330	Tribes, you know, we're gonna go do our thing.
7195330	7203321	Meanwhile, you got people in the tribe trying- Let them talk shit about each other in private behind each other's back like normal people do.
7203321	7206365	That's what the YouTubers are, but they just say it out in public.
7206365	7208788	And then I just have to hit an X on their channel because I'm like, I'm not dealing with you.
7212403	7215587	Thank you, you're following the request I put out earlier in the show.
7215587	7217910	It is time to unsubscribe from these dramatic people.
7231366	7232367	In a way, it does make sense.
7250113	7251574	Maybe there is an asterisk.
7251574	7255517	Support professional independent broadcasting.
7255517	7256417	I know that sounds weird.
7256417	7257959	That sounds like a, but you know what I mean?
7257959	7260000	Support mature.
7260000	7260761	You're right.
7260761	7273130	Because when you are a YouTube internet gaming journalist and you're promoting your episodes on True Social, I'm just going to hit the X and just keep it walking.
7273130	7273971	No, ma'am.
7273971	7274231	No, ma'am.
7275658	7277480	No, ma'am.
7277480	7281865	In the words of the great jazz, in the words of the great jazzman masters, no, ma'am.
7281865	7283506	No, ma'am.
7283506	7287871	Yeah.
7287871	7292055	Anyhow, any other thoughts you want to bring to the table tonight, Ranma?
7292055	7297101	Remember that whole debacle about Ubisoft and gaming and licensing and stuff like that?
7297748	7303552	Yes, but, quickly, SG100 Matt says, support positivity, not toxicity.
7303552	7305734	I love that angle to it.
7305734	7306414	I like that too.
7306414	7309597	Support non-toxic independent broadcasting.
7309597	7311038	I like that.
7311038	7319024	Sia Tabiri also phrases it this way, support independent broadcasting, but use your sense, you dummy.
7319024	7319884	I love that.
7319884	7320425	Anyway, sorry, Ranma.
7321792	7329413	All I'm gonna say is the same thing's happening with Funimation and Crunchyroll, and if you kind of tune into our show this week- I saw that, Drama.
7329413	7331034	Drama.
7331034	7333674	That's- Here's- but here's the thing.
7333674	7337415	Funimation never sold digital anime.
7337415	7344156	When you buy box sets, you get a voucher for the episodes that you bought so you can watch them online.
7344156	7347797	People are just mad they have to get up and pull the disc off their shelf
7349146	7352769	Blow the dust off the case and put it in their console and watch it.
7357173	7358935	with having physical editions.
7358935	7360156	Oh, that's really funny.
7360156	7361577	I didn't even realize that.
7361577	7363198	That is really, really funny.
7363198	7371546	Still, though, it's still a thing, though, because if you buy it with the expectation that you can do that, then you're still losing something.
7371546	7379032	So regardless of whether it's you're purchasing it just digitally or not, you're still losing value from that.
7379032	7381755	So it's still it's still not right.
7381755	7383596	It's just stupid rights fighting.
7383596	7384097	I don't know.
7384690	7389194	Valid point, but as per the EULA, you only own a license to view or watch it.
7389194	7394939	But the fact of the matter is, you may have lost a digital copy, but you still have a physical copy of it.
7394939	7398623	And there are people, well, you know, hi, hello, or, you know.
7399969	7414921	I don't know, I feel like between all this, the quadruple A games, the cloud, the Zaslav writing off multi-million dollar movies and now Netflix, I feel like the bubble is about to burst on all of this.
7415561	7421045	I realized that would require Congress doing something which is near impossible.
7421045	7426169	But I'm really trying to hope that maybe some things will shift around in the next few years.
7426169	7434415	And the bubble is really going to burst on this shit, because, you know, we're getting to the point where a lot of people that are lawmakers are people that grew up on video games.
7434415	7438419	We're not quite there yet because we got a lot of we got a lot of real old people still.
7438419	7440420	But, you know.
7440420	7440900	It's coming.
7441781	7443782	where there's going to be people that understand this a lot better.
7443782	7447264	They're going to start to, you know, kind of call these companies out on their bullshit.
7447264	7449506	You already see actually what's his name?
7449506	7451047	Joaquin Castro.
7451047	7457710	I believe a representative from Texas already calling out Warner Brothers on this and this whole thing.
7457710	7470138	So, yeah, I read about that a while back and I without getting into deep because of what Warner Brothers did to the movie, it kind of
7472148	7476351	We kind of feel that in my field of work, per se.
7476351	7483816	But again, I'm far up the ladder where if it was to be affected, I'd just see a raindrop come out the window, but you know.
7483816	7485597	Plug your ears.
7485597	7498606	I don't normally support piracy, but it's going to take one hero to knock Zaslav down a few pegs real quick by doing one simple, very illegal thing.
7499693	7504615	Yeah, but all the digital copies are watermarked and they'll be able to find out who did it.
7504615	7508777	Unfortunately, they're all digitally watermarked and there's no way to get rid of it.
7508777	7518382	But yeah, they should still release it or at the very least not allow them to just get a tax write off from it because that's the American tax people are paying for that.
7518382	7524245	So do something like it's ridiculous that they get to work the system like this.
7526641	7531385	I'll say this much when it comes to piracy, and then I'm gonna get off and go do whatever I gotta do.
7531385	7532906	I gotta play Sea of Stars.
7532906	7535969	I was pro-piracy across the board.
7535969	7538231	Get it while you can, yarr har har.
7538231	7544016	But as I got older, I started talking to people in the industry, and I have a different view on it.
7544016	7544676	Same, same.
7544676	7546077	I look at it this way.
7546077	7554805	If you cannot find it through normal means, and the price to acquire it is above your means, see what you gotta do.
7557599	7561465	ZenMonkey11 in chat says it's probably just a bad movie.
7561465	7563388	Let them keep it hidden.
7563388	7564951	You know, you may not be wrong.
7564951	7566573	However, you are
7568584	7570825	And you're all we all see showgirls, right?
7570825	7571525	How would we know?
7571525	7573265	And how would he know it's a bad movie?
7573265	7576526	He allegedly hasn't watched it yet before it's canceled.
7576526	7581948	So how would we know it's a bad movie if it hasn't been viewed by the person that's canceling it?
7581948	7589570	Here's my response to that comment is is you respectfully are forgetting one of the core elements of humanity.
7589570	7594992	People want what they cannot have.
7594992	7595872	That's what it's about.
7598308	7603230	And they had the opportunity to, like, if it was a bad movie, like, here's the thing that doesn't make any sense.
7603230	7610832	They're, they're, they're writing it off for like $30 million out of a $70 million cost for the movie.
7610832	7617114	And yet I think Paramount was willing to pay them the, more than the amount that they would have been able to write it off for.
7617114	7617374	It's like,
7619488	7620588	Why not just do that?
7620588	7622169	Then you can also get residuals from it as well.
7622169	7624829	How much did they fucking lose on Waterworld all those years ago?
7624829	7630611	Well, it's because they want to they want to stop paying the residuals for like people.
7630611	7638893	That's why they got rid of all the discovery programs, because they didn't want to pay those people the residual money for airing those on those networks.
7638893	7642974	So it's just you just see the CEOs need to be fired.
7642974	7645955	Anyway, out of a cannon into a solid wall.
7646175	7651617	Thank you so much for your positive and impactful call into the program.
7651617	7658099	Please, a quick plug for Anime Jam session because I'm sure there's more people that want to talk about this Funimation and Crunchyroll stuff.
7658099	7659940	Tell us all about it, please.
7659940	7660400	Oh, we will.
7660400	7661841	We're gonna be talking about that.
7661841	7664822	There has been some cosplay drama in the world that
7665638	7667899	I have to talk about because I know the people involved.
7667899	7670281	I'm trying to simmer it out.
7670281	7675944	We got that and a whole lot more over at AnimeJamSession.com, Tuesday nights, 9 p.m.
7675944	7679747	Eastern, right here on Twitch TV slash Anime Jam Session.
7679747	7683449	Proud to be part of the Voice of Geeks Network at VOGNetwork.com.
7683449	7686831	I love that elevator pitch, and it's always great to have you as a part of the network.
7686831	7691054	Ranma, you have a wonderful, fantastic night, and we'll talk to you soon.
7691054	7691474	You got it.
7691474	7692655	And by the way, I learned that from you.
7693646	7694406	Thank you.
7694406	7694887	All right.
7694887	7697508	Bye, my friend.
7697508	7698248	What a pal.
7698248	7702370	Now my brain is going, I learned it from watching you.
7702370	7703930	All right.
7703930	7705431	I think that is about it.
7705431	7710813	Actually, let me check in with Loki real quick, just to make sure we don't have any last minute stories from Loki.
7710813	7714535	No, I was going to ask you, though, have you seen the Doctor Who The Giggle yet?
7715646	7716326	was that the special?
7716326	7717507	I haven't seen it yet.
7717507	7718488	No, I haven't seen it.
7718488	7721310	That's the one with Neil Patrick Harris playing the Toymaker?
7721310	7722190	Yeah, yeah, no, I haven't seen it.
7722190	7725012	I missed that one, but I need to go back and see it.
7725012	7730536	I saw the one before that that was based off of the 1981 comic.
7730536	7737060	There is a music number in that episode where he dances to Spice Up Your Life.
7737060	7740443	At the very least, just look up the clip online.
7740443	7742204	Nice.
7742204	7744025	He's so good in everything he does.
7744025	7745366	He is absolutely amazing.
7746568	7750671	Alright, well on that note, we are going to wrap things up for the night.
7750671	7752632	Thank you all so much for tuning in tonight.
7752632	7756454	Even with a big football game on TV, y'all made time for us and we appreciate it.
7756454	7761357	And hey, if you listen to us throughout the week on the podcast feed, we, excuse me, we appreciate that too.
7761357	7762358	Thank you so much.
7762358	7765620	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Science Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
7765620	7766280	Help us spread the word.
7766280	7767741	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7768041	7770083	We need more voices to put out on air.
7770083	7776830	A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever you found this show goes an awful long way as well.
7776830	7779132	Thank you all so much for your continued support.
7779132	7781835	It means everything.
7781835	7784758	Let's wrap it up with some final thoughts and all that good stuff.
7784758	7789363	DarkSakura, I will start with you because I know you are going to be off and streaming some Dead by Daylight.
7789363	7791105	Are you doing more lights out tonight?
7791105	7791165	Or?
7791750	7796754	Yeah, I think I am because I want to finish the the brief tome.
7796754	7798876	So I might I might do killer.
7798876	7799997	I might do survivor.
7799997	7800457	We'll see.
7800457	7804381	But it's probably going to be be killer because I want to try out Legion.
7804381	7806522	I think we'll have fun.
7806522	7813949	But yeah, and I'm going to get on my pajamas, play a stealth killer for me like a Myers or I play pig.
7814659	7816340	Oh, yeah, I guess pig stealth.
7816340	7816860	Yeah.
7816860	7819822	Let me know if you're in there and I'll switch to Myers for you.
7819822	7823224	Okay, probably lurk, but we'll see.
7823224	7824405	Just let me know that you're around.
7824405	7824745	Okay.
7824745	7825585	All right.
7825585	7826246	All right.
7826246	7827146	Later taters.
7827146	7831149	And remember fact check all the things.
7831149	7831649	All right.
7831649	7831909	Take care.
7831909	7834431	Stop regurgitating the shit other people say.
7834431	7836132	Have a good night.
7836132	7837452	Bye.
7837452	7839874	Um, with that, I guess we go to you Loki with your final thought tonight.
7840820	7850211	My final thought is I'm super excited that Dropout's Game Changer Season 6 is starting tomorrow.
7850211	7853796	Freaking love that streaming service, but Game Changer is amazing.
7854739	7864047	Alright, my final thought is I want to shout out the Scream Queens Gorlesk here locally, the burlesque troupe I work with and Variety for an amazing show last night.
7864047	7870052	And shout out to Amber Sweet's Rocky Horror Cast for the show they're going to put on this weekend.
7870052	7874195	Had some great, had a great show last night and looking forward to a great show this weekend.
7874195	7876797	Been loving the stage events here in SAC.
7876797	7879319	So yeah, that's that's my final thought.
7880060	7882521	It's 2024 thriving so far.
7882521	7883641	We hope you all are too.
7883641	7884681	Have a great week.
7884681	7886942	We will be back in seven days.
7886942	7889142	And I guarantee.
7889142	7897324	Well, I don't guarantee I shouldn't guarantee anything, but it's adding up to look a lot like we're going to have an awful lot to discuss next week.
7897324	7898745	So be here early.
7898745	7899625	Have a good night, everybody.
