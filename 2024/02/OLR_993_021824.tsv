9927	17349	Xbox president Sarah Bond has stated that Microsoft is working on the next-gen Xbox, which will be the largest technical leap you've ever seen in a hardware generation.
17349	26671	Maybe making up for the fact that the leap from the last generation to this one was not so incredible, despite consoles being larger than they ever have been, and if PC video cards are any indication, they're not getting any smaller.
26671	28651	Inside this cynic is a disappointed idealist.
28651	36233	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about this, the Xbox podcast, and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38823	41685	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41685	49449	Welcome back to another week of the show where we always get it right on the first take and talk about all things video games.
49449	61275	It's the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 993 of our show for tonight, February the 18th of 2024.
61275	65718	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined live each and every week as we do tape live, of course,
66138	74042	Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
74042	79725	And you can hear myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
79725	81106	Hey, guess what?
81106	82867	I made a new theme song for us.
82867	84267	Did you?
84267	84567	Yeah.
84567	85608	You want a preview?
85608	86068	Yeah.
86068	87649	Like legit a new intro.
87649	88549	That's awesome.
88549	89170	You ready?
89170	89590	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
94824	96205	I hate you.
96205	98026	Delete it.
98026	99246	Show's over.
99246	101927	Okay, so here's the thing.
101927	104909	I've been having some microphone issues as we're doing live tonight.
104909	106009	It's not microphone issues.
106009	108870	It's setting issues and configurations that got reset and everything.
108870	111972	So this is actually the third take of the show's intro, but darn it.
111972	114513	This is going to get it right this time.
114513	116554	So yeah, exactly.
117074	120677	Anyway, uh, we got my soundboard came in handy.
120677	121558	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
121558	122758	All right.
122758	124080	But how's your week going?
124080	128503	Otherwise, DarkSakura, besides all the constant retakes tonight?
128503	131085	Um, well, it's been okay.
131085	133967	Yeah, it's it's been a medical week.
133967	135548	Does that make sense?
135548	137210	Yes, I think so.
137210	141173	But usually, I mean, that's a good good medical stuff, hopefully.
142045	145008	Well, I mean, in the I'll just go ahead and put it out here.
145008	148691	I had part of my toenail permanently removed.
148691	149712	Mm hmm.
149712	154536	And I had a cortisone shot in my hip.
154536	155516	And I had a blood draw.
155516	161081	OK, so you're you're getting your so like I'm like the human pin cushion today.
161081	164144	You're getting your punch card stamped for ten ten visits.
164144	166306	Get one free at the doctor's office type of thing, right?
167363	176565	I got at least two things done in one day so that was fine.
176565	179906	Not to mention when I got the jab in my toe.
179906	184306	Nothing hurts worse than getting the lidocaine in your toe.
184306	186207	Or whatever they want to give you.
186207	189007	But I will tell you this.
189007	191668	I found that it hurts worse when I can't see it happen.
192995	193496	Reaction
210140	216342	Oh no, when I get my blood drawn, I walk in there and I say, go ahead and take it from right here and put it on the arm.
216342	218003	I'm going to be looking out the window.
218003	218583	No offense.
218583	219544	I just don't like to watch.
219544	222345	You know, I have my system down.
222345	224045	Then do this instead.
224045	232408	When you feel the first, breathe in then, and then just let it out slowly and it will still force you to relax.
232408	233689	It'll make it hurt less.
233809	236270	I do feel like I kind of instinctively do that a little bit.
236270	237510	So maybe.
237510	237890	Yeah.
237890	241872	Anyway, I do want to anyway, I sort of mentioned Medical Lounge Radio.
241872	243932	Yeah, no, I want to mention our chat room, though.
243932	244933	Reekin Elite is there.
244933	245193	Hello.
245193	248194	Hello, saying OMG, you okay?
248194	250034	You know, you're talking to me.
250034	250995	Yeah, I'm fine.
250995	251215	Yeah.
251215	251975	Okay.
251975	257797	Keep in mind, a lot of stuff that I do when when I go in for stuff like this is preventative.
257797	257917	Hmm.
259382	269700	I would rather, like for example I get like mild ingrown toenails and since I'm doing ballet I know they'll get worse so I just had them do it
270686	271006	DarkSakura
292034	295717	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
309046	334238	which I think the normal age like 73, 74 and my dad's like 10 years above that so he finally had to have one of his eyes done this week and so I had to take him not just to the surgery but then the next day take him to the follow-up appointment so I just I had to basically play uber this week which is fine because it sounds like my dad like he's like yeah I can actually see better because right now now he has one eye without and one eye with because he has the other eye now scheduled to be done in April
334778	336739	So he has one eye without, one eye with.
336739	338060	He's like, yeah, I can see the difference.
338060	338821	It's kind of trippy.
338821	341963	Like the, one of them's got different color hues than the other.
341963	345525	So he's kind of living with that for a little bit until they do the other eye.
345525	348707	So, um, kind of interesting.
348707	352350	Once my right toe is healed up, then I'm going to get the left one done.
352350	357113	Um, I might wait and do it after my birthday trip to Disneyland.
357113	358834	Um, so we'll see.
358834	361516	Um, but I mean, you know, uh,
363467	379305	Ranma was saying that he gets a blood draw every three months and I get a full blood panel twice a year for my post-bariatric surgery panel and they also take a few extras like parathyroid and thyroid because I'm on thyroid medication.
380226	382767	So I watch the whole thing.
382767	388310	And every so often, I'll take a picture of the vials and then go get color matched for hair dye.
388310	389931	No, no.
389931	390771	Do you remember?
390771	391212	Do you remember?
391212	393233	Sorry, I promise it's a video game show.
393233	395034	But sometimes we catch up on our personal lives too.
395034	397035	This is our little little chat show every week.
397035	399516	Do you remember when I had that big bump on the back of my neck?
399963	400583	You remember?
400583	401724	I don't know.
401724	402365	The lipoma?
402365	404866	Yeah, most of that was during the pandemic, I think.
404866	407908	So I don't know how if you ever saw it, like when it got like really big or whatever.
407908	410270	But they finally cut that out a few years ago, right?
410270	411511	So I don't have it anymore.
411511	413492	And because because it was starting to hurt.
413492	414953	And the minute I said, I think it hurts.
414953	416354	They were like, Nope, we're taking it out.
416354	417695	We're making sure it's not anything bad.
417695	418976	Good news isn't anything bad.
418976	423779	But the first thing once they took that out, which they did not put me under for, which okay, fine.
423779	424380	It's local anesthetic.
424380	424760	That's normal.
425020	428381	Yeah, but when they took it out, the first thing they were like, do you want to see it?
428381	431322	And I said, absolutely the fuck not.
431322	432703	Do I want to see that?
432703	434724	Throw it in the garbage.
434724	435464	And they did.
435464	436905	My pomas aren't gross.
436905	439706	It literally is just fat.
439706	441606	That whole, that whole experience.
441606	444367	See, and this is people take to the medical stuff differently.
444367	452751	No, that whole thing, like I was in shock for like four hours after that whole thing happened, because I should not have been awake for it.
452751	453131	Honestly,
454071	458434	Lipoma, unless it's like within the muscle or something.
458434	463217	It's absolutely like common procedure to be awake during lipoma removal.
463217	465619	I'm sure it is, but I still should have been.
465619	469661	That's all I'm saying, because I was not a great experience.
469661	480388	But, you know, I actually had to be able to recognize lipoma and cysts and cancers and things as a massage therapist.
480388	480949	But I will.
481927	485549	I will tell you is like I told I told her flat out when I get the other toe done.
485549	486910	I want to watch it.
486910	490592	Gosh, I've been awake for a couple of different surgeries.
490592	499377	Although they said that I talked people's ear off and they that's why they had it to sedate me during the second of one of my surgeries because I want to know everything that's going on.
499377	500158	I want to watch.
500905	503327	All right, well, we need to check in with of course, our other hosts.
503327	505689	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
505689	506169	Hello.
506169	508551	Hey, what fun medical procedures have you had done this week?
508551	509591	You or your family members?
509591	513554	Do you have any good trips to the doctor stories?
513554	515096	Eye surgeries?
515096	515996	Upcoming?
515996	516797	All right.
516797	517477	Well, you're boring.
517477	517898	No, no.
517898	518478	That's all right.
518478	520099	All right.
520099	520960	Well, how are you doing?
520960	521941	Have you had a good week too, Loki?
522745	523666	Thanks for watching!
535953	537654	You know, well, not in grade school.
537654	542195	So I guess that, you know, I can't complain because you know, everybody has Monday off.
542195	546717	I honestly I have so much because I was out for, you know, a good few hours.
546717	552539	My dad was like, I have to check in for a couple hours tomorrow just to get caught up because then I work Tuesday.
552539	553279	And then that's it.
553279	556100	I'm off for like 10 days because it's nice.
556100	560201	Yeah, the cruise and everything and having to travel out to Orlando and everything.
560201	564283	So it's it's Yeah, it's gonna be a nice break.
564283	564583	But yeah,
565808	565868	and
588809	592352	The people that are kind of there this week that hopefully everything's okay.
592352	598818	I really hope it's not like a bumpy road or anything because I'm like, dang, there's like a lot of people that all of a sudden are taking vacation at the end of February.
598818	611289	But I feel like it's a lot of people that had just delayed stuff for various reasons, whether it was, you know, COVID or just other types of, you know, obligations and things that just kind of popped up that like everybody's gone at the same time.
611289	612010	So this is interesting.
612557	615058	I've kind of noticed some of that, too.
615058	620659	Although I'll tell you what's what's weird is that my schedule has been going back and forth.
620659	634382	And finally, I'm just like, pick one, because I went back on my four by ten this past week and I realized that I don't think I can do my four by tens like like I was with the nature of what I do at work.
634382	638183	So I'm back on the five bytes Monday through Friday.
638183	638683	And you know what?
638683	640044	I think I'm OK with it.
640044	640624	Yeah.
640624	640784	Yeah.
642402	647367	SSJ100 Matt says, whatever you do, don't sign on to Slack, not even to see it burning.
647367	648388	Enjoy the break.
648388	649669	Well, we don't use Slack.
649669	651030	We use a different application.
651030	652672	It's essentially the same thing.
652672	657737	But I am lucky enough that I have a work and a personal so and my work... What's going on with Slack?
657737	659478	We don't use it.
659478	660039	That's all.
660039	661961	It's just... I mean, but why did he mention Slack?
661961	663222	Is there something going on with Slack?
663362	670327	No, no, no, it's like if you're awake, I think the point is if you're away on vacation, don't look at everything that's burning while you're away on vacation.
670327	672609	And anyway, I literally can't.
672609	676412	I literally can't take my work phone even if I wanted to because this trip is going out of the country.
676412	678053	And that's that's we're not supposed to do that.
678053	681836	So it's Yeah, so sorry, no work phone for me.
681836	683177	Oh, darn.
683177	684858	I have to enjoy the time off.
684858	685018	So
686039	686639	But it'll be fine.
686639	687500	Everything's gonna be fine.
687500	689300	You know, everything always has a way to work out.
689300	692602	And that's another thing to remember is that, you know, everything works out.
692602	693042	It's good.
693042	694483	I'm gonna have a good break.
694483	701085	So anyway, um, let's see, uh, as Chase Winermath says, I just assumed he was using Slack because most of my friends use Slack.
701085	703146	Bobby Blackwell says, I mute notifications in Slack.
703146	704507	Wow, a lot of you use Slack.
704507	708649	DJ Ranma S says, if I hear Slack go off multiple times in 30 seconds, then I'll answer it.
708649	711750	You know, the weird thing is, I've only ever used Slack because of video games.
712350	719517	A lot of Ingress planning has always happened on Slack, especially live events and things like that.
719517	730488	There's a big Pokemon Go event going on this weekend in LA actually, which if I wasn't going on the cruise, I probably would have tried to go to LA this weekend to do that with some friends because it's relatively close.
730488	732670	But yeah, didn't end up doing that.
734071	740374	I'm sure I'll have to ask my friend how that went because one of my good friends did go down to that so maybe I can get him to do a report next week.
740374	745015	I hear the first day was kind of rough, but he was doing the Sunday so maybe it was a little easier for him.
745015	745896	I don't know.
745896	750918	But anyway, let's get into the news of the week and talk about what is going on in video games.
750918	757840	And again, as I've hinted at a million times during the show, we will not be here next week because of the cruise I was just talking about.
757840	760381	So we'll be back in two weeks to do it all again.
760381	761542	So um,
762262	765444	in the meantime, someone will take requests for gaming.
765444	766705	There you go.
766705	768706	Bobby will be here, by the way, especially too.
768706	772089	So I should encourage everybody to still tune in to VOG Network live next week.
772089	775051	Bobby Blackwolf will be here, but obviously we will not.
775051	777852	And I know it's a weird week to not be here.
777852	786378	So that's why I'm especially after the power outage of last, you know, a couple weeks ago and all that other stuff, which, by the way, we have another big storm coming in tonight.
786378	786818	Yay.
787919	789701	It was so nice earlier too.
789701	792424	I know the worst of that rain is supposed to be till like 11 o'clock.
792424	794126	So we'll be we'll be off the air by that point.
794126	795107	But yeah.
795107	799752	Anyway, um, that means I'm gonna actually sleep like a baby tonight.
799752	800793	That's gonna be last night.
800793	801834	I slept really well too.
801834	809382	But like I was I sleep so incredibly well when there's a hard rain that I have an awful time trying to wake up the next day.
809382	810263	Interesting.
810263	810543	All right.
811227	812229	Let's get into the news.
826929	827169	and more!
846611	848012	Not so much.
848012	849493	This could be a nothing burger.
849493	851895	This could be a nothing burger is what this could be.
851895	855878	But Loki, let's it's I don't know if I would call it a nothing burger.
855878	856658	It's not.
856658	858739	This was definitely like nothing.
858739	868106	Like have you ever ordered your hamburger completely plain with nothing on it and no fixings and it's just a plain ass dry hamburger.
868106	868706	That's what this is.
870328	872691	But Loki, let's let's get into it.
872691	877599	So what happened with the big Xbox podcast and the future?
877599	878981	What is the future of Xbox?
880131	883132	So the future of Xbox is podcasts.
883132	888695	They're going to be doing lots of them to talk about the future of Xbox, and it's a very nice format.
888695	893797	No, they discussed a few things regarding of what's going to be coming up.
893797	899859	So they did confirm that, yes, there are games planned to be put out multi-platform.
899859	904841	However, they are not going to be Starfield or Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
904841	905662	So it's going to be
907751	908612	We'll see.
908612	910213	I'm sorry, PlayStation fans.
910213	911534	You're going to be getting Redfall.
911534	914776	It's probably going to be all Redfall four times, actually.
914776	915697	Not getting Redfall.
915697	918238	They already know what the games are like.
918238	919139	Yeah, they do.
919139	921080	They know what the games are.
921080	923162	They're waiting for those.
923162	929306	They basically said that they didn't want to take away from those teams making those announcements themselves.
929306	932728	So they're waiting on those development teams to make those announcements.
932728	934990	So those will probably come later on the year, honestly, like
936340	940950	I don't think it's a big deal until we find out what it is, like if it's Halo coming to PlayStation 5.
942352	966554	maybe I mean like I I don't I don't know I think like we might tell you right now I'm gonna tell you right now the four games are Grounded, Pentament, Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves those are the four games like it's yeah I mean Xbox hasn't confirmed that Microsoft hasn't confirmed that but it's one of those things where all of the others that we already knew about Hi-Fi Rush we were reporting on that four weeks ago
967495	991945	all of the signs are pointing that way and especially when you consider that Microsoft has laid off a lot of people and some of them are going to start squeaking even though they're doing it in a way they're not going to get caught because they still have an NDA for their severance and all that stuff like it's it's all but certain these are the four games and when you look at the four games it's four games that make a lot of sense to go multi-platform that's why I think we're sitting here going this is this is a plain burger this is barely anything this is not
992145	992365	and more.
1015686	1016026	Elder Scrolls
1032671	1032871	Setsuna
1062688	1065170	or... Oh, I don't even remember what the game was.
1065170	1071274	But they had like a major AA game that now is kind of a AAA game that's getting a sequel.
1071274	1076598	And I can't remember the name of it because I don't... Who does?
1076598	1077939	Microsoft does.
1077939	1082222	They have... They came out with one and now they've been teasing it for like... Hellblade?
1083001	1083581	Hellblade.
1083581	1084062	Yes.
1084062	1084262	Yeah.
1084262	1084622	Hellblade.
1084622	1085422	That's what I was thinking.
1085422	1085643	Yeah.
1085643	1086163	Hellblade.
1086163	1089745	So Hellblade was more of like a double A game when it first came out.
1089745	1099551	And now it's kind of, you know, still being treated like that, but it's kind of elevating itself to a triple A game just because of quality and everything.
1099551	1102412	But it's still relatively small studio putting that out.
1102412	1107395	I mean, you could even argue that like a No Man's Sky is almost like a double A game.
1107395	1109497	That's kind of a triple A game in a sense.
1110584	1118868	Also, we should probably stop referring to games with A's because it's just stupid anyways and that's really only marketing speak for, you know, publishers and who cares.
1121135	1138038	Along with that, though, they did announce that coming to Game Pass, one of the first Activision Blizzard games, aside from I think Call of Duty's been on there before, but Diablo 4 is going to be one of the first from this merger that's going to be coming to Game Pass, and that's going to be arriving at the end of March on the 28th.
1138038	1139439	So that's pretty exciting.
1139439	1142239	I thought I would be surprised by that news, but I'm not.
1142239	1144500	And you know why I'm not surprised?
1144500	1148641	It's it's because they haven't what's not coming to Game Pass, at least not yet.
1148641	1150321	Anyway, we haven't heard the expansion.
1151121	1155805	So they want people to tap into Diablo so they can sell more copies of that expansion.
1155805	1165311	Assuming, I don't know, I feel like when I read the transcript, because I didn't, I actually didn't watch the part, again, I was way too busy with what I was doing during the day.
1165311	1167293	So I didn't watch it live.
1167293	1168654	I read the transcript after the fact.
1169034	1173819	And I want to say in the transcript, he calls out the Diablo expansion as one of those big games.
1173819	1176521	And then he kind of says something about like they're all game pass or whatever.
1176521	1179424	So the waters were a little muddy on that.
1179424	1182707	But my assumption is that expansion will not be game pass day one.
1182707	1183948	I'd love to be wrong.
1183948	1185389	I would assume that's the case.
1185389	1189653	And maybe later on down the line when there's like a Diablo game of the year edition or something, they'll do that.
1189893	1193635	Even if it is included with Game Pass, Diablo still makes plenty of money.
1193635	1195916	Don't forget, they have a battle pass in Diablo now.
1195916	1199598	They're selling $30 portal colors and all these other things in the games.
1199598	1206622	They have other ways to make money with Diablo besides just, you know, the sale of the actual game.
1206622	1217027	So yeah, I was surprised at first and I was like, actually, you know what, this far out from the game's release now, of course, they're gonna try to just make money off that in other ways.
1218956	1219856	Yeah.
1219856	1230260	One of the other things that you talked about too was the fact that one of the catalysts for going multi-platform is, you know, having with all the layoffs they've had to do.
1230260	1235442	So basically saying that, you know, this way they're going to help, you know, be able to, I guess, retain more people.
1236826	1239668	If you believe that, I don't know.
1239668	1242251	So hopefully that's true.
1242251	1242651	We'll see.
1242651	1248396	Because if you have more devs working on porting games to other platforms, I could see that as a positive.
1248396	1252800	But we'll see what that actually ends up looking like.
1252800	1255382	Also, they've committed to new hardware coming.
1255382	1262928	And that it's going to be the largest technical leap that you've ever seen in the hardware generation.
1264069	1264990	I'll believe it when I see it.
1264990	1267411	Is it a holodeck?
1267411	1271512	They say that every time.
1271512	1274974	The technical leap and all that stuff, in one ear, out the other.
1274974	1276454	Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
1276454	1280796	But otherwise, it's, you know, okay, they're committed to the hardware game.
1280796	1284238	Yeah, it's supposed to be coming, or they're gonna announce it this holiday.
1285365	1289206	Have they mastered consumer level quantum computing?
1289206	1291767	Well, anything's possible.
1291767	1300929	But it's interesting that, you know, that goes right in the face of why all those people were, you know, smashing their Xboxes and returning to the store and all that stuff last week.
1300929	1302149	Those people are dumb.
1302149	1303229	I mean, come on.
1303229	1305270	We knew that.
1305270	1307550	It's attention grabbing nonsense.
1307550	1310511	Hysteria media is, you know, what it was.
1311567	1313970	Yeah, E3VL points out iPhone.
1313970	1314911	Name any product.
1314911	1316653	Just put any product where you put there.
1316653	1318856	Our best yet, it's always that.
1318856	1319236	Always that.
1319236	1320178	So it's the same thing with Xbox.
1320178	1321499	Of course it's going to be their best yet.
1321499	1323982	Because if it's not their best yet, then why am I buying it?
1323982	1325224	Or why should I buy it?
1325224	1326586	Because it's cheaper.
1326586	1329930	That would be the Xbox Series S. We've decided to lower your expectations.
1330250	1330891	Lower Your Expectations
1352299	1369422	anyway um yeah i uh it's you know all of this really doesn't seem to be that much the other thing that i kind of caught out of this was the whole like xbox on every screen which is which we knew that's been kind of yeah that's
1370143	1370383	DarkSakura
1386528	1388989	I think that's maybe that's what's coming to holiday me.
1388989	1390290	You don't know.
1390290	1391291	Maybe.
1391291	1391691	Maybe.
1391691	1392131	Who knows?
1392131	1392571	I'm not.
1392571	1398975	Yeah, I'm not going to speculate too much more on that because we've all done enough speculation when it comes to Microsoft for an entire five years.
1398975	1400996	But yeah, here's.
1402162	1404843	Here's where I think a mistake was made, though.
1404843	1407263	Here's where I think Phil Spencer's slipping a little bit.
1407263	1408303	And I'm going to look.
1408303	1412104	I realize I've praised the guy a lot.
1412104	1415125	I think he's made some bad calls in the last couple of months.
1415125	1416845	Obviously, the layoffs don't look good.
1416845	1418305	That's that's not a great thing.
1418305	1428227	There's no there's no easy way to slice that, especially doesn't look good when you kind of told the government that isn't exactly what you were going to do and then say, oh, but never mind, because Activision Blizzard was going to do it.
1428227	1429267	And that all that.
1429267	1430728	Not exactly a layoff.
1430728	1431628	That all looks crappy.
1432148	1437231	But what really looks crappy, I'm sorry, what was he thinking with that tweet?
1437231	1448498	What on earth was he thinking when he wrote that tweet that said, we hear a lot of buzz and rumors about what's going on and we look forward to clarifying next week?
1449298	1452260	There, he should have shut that shit down when he could.
1452260	1457022	Not that he needed to quell the hysterical YouTube users.
1457022	1458403	That's not what I'm talking about.
1458403	1459944	Fuck them and their Xboxes.
1459944	1461245	I don't give a shit.
1461245	1476053	I'm talking about the runaway clickbait headlines that are the reality of the internet and the reality that way too many people get their news from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
1477173	1478454	and Tik Tok.
1478454	1479274	And those types of things.
1479274	1482475	They don't get news, they get fed rhetoric.
1482475	1484196	They get a sentence.
1484196	1488658	They get the thing that's trying to entice you to do more.
1488658	1496042	And for me, that tweet that he wrote was completely ignorant of that fact that that was going to happen.
1496042	1498943	And he easily had an opportunity to say,
1500296	1504523	We hear a lot of rumors about the future of Xbox.
1504523	1512215	We remain committed to Xbox as a platform, including hardware, and we look forward to sharing our vision next week.
1514580	1517161	Yes, it's like you should be in PR or something.
1517161	1520183	Yeah.
1520183	1525685	It's almost like I've had to explain things to people in different ways a few times in my life, but we're not going to go there.
1525685	1527626	My point is it.
1527626	1528026	I just.
1528026	1529166	Welcome to my job.
1529166	1539231	I can't believe that like he didn't craft a better tweet to stop this hysteria from getting out of fucking control when he could have done it.
1539870	1543271	It's their marketing team that should have, or was, no, was it his own account?
1543271	1545412	I mean, it was his own marketing team.
1545412	1545872	Yeah, I'm sure.
1545872	1547413	But it is also a chance.
1547413	1549634	I'm sure a team did that, but still, yeah.
1549634	1558337	To build more buzz, hopefully, in their, like, to try to turn it around, to build a little bit more buzz in, hopefully, a positive way.
1558337	1561919	I mean, they say that there's no such thing as bad advertise, as a,
1562939	1563700	Bad Advertising
1578024	1582186	Let me make sure just for sake, I get the full tweet here.
1582186	1582807	Here it is.
1582807	1584468	And I don't, what are these replies?
1584468	1585749	I can't stand this.
1585749	1591852	Anyway, but just pay attention to the top of the screen here where it says, we're listening and we hear you.
1591852	1599196	We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox.
1600177	1608299	He left this wide fucking open for people to say, oh, this means Xbox is now a publishing platform.
1608299	1610560	They're not going to make hardware anymore.
1610560	1614821	He should have said in that post, they're still committed to hardware.
1614821	1617401	I don't know why he left the door wide open like that.
1617401	1621842	And for me, I've said a lot of great things about Phil, but I got a call.
1621842	1624203	I'm always going to call it out on both sides.
1624203	1625223	When it's right, it's right.
1625223	1626463	When it's wrong, it's wrong.
1626463	1627484	This was wrong.
1627484	1628184	This is a bad move.
1629324	1631025	You know what this makes me think of?
1631025	1642649	I think it was Eddie Izzard said this at the start of a performance that the thing that's best is the anticipation right before the event happens.
1642649	1647091	You know, you speculate and you think and you get excited or it could be this, it could be that.
1647091	1649592	And then when it finally happens, it's like, oh, yeah.
1651008	1679171	I would be very definitely I would be very curious what Xbox console sales look like between the time that tweet happened and the time the event happened now granted it's February and you know it's they haven't had a new console in a bit they were probably pretty low anyway but I would be very curious what financial impact that tweet had because I bet it had some probably not a ton but some
1680595	1681575	DarkSakura
1706357	1708358	I don't understand why it won't.
1708358	1714402	And I know there's probably Xbox fans that would hit me with a rolled up newspaper to kind of paraphrase what someone said in chat a little bit ago.
1714402	1722886	I'm sure there's people that would say that, but I don't see how that wouldn't make that game and its reception even better to have a chance.
1722886	1724467	It's everything I said last week.
1724467	1730150	Relaunch, redo it on the PlayStation with the patch and the DLC and everything.
1730150	1732732	Redo it with Nintendo Switch, LOL.
1733293	1741615	It would literally implode on itself because it's running on such an old engine that maybe they just can't do it or they just...
1742711	1744311	don't know how to do it correctly.
1744311	1754234	Exactly what PogCulture says in chat, pull a No Man's Sky or a Diablo 3 or any, you know, any of these other games that, you know, used a multi-platform approach as a relaunch of the game.
1754234	1762076	I'm a little shocked that they're not willing to gamble with Starfield because I feel like Starfield has already made all the money it's going to make.
1762076	1764777	So why not try to gamble to get a little more?
1764777	1767337	I mean, I'm just, I am legit surprised.
1767337	1768558	The Indiana Jones game
1769378	1770579	Yes, I'm surprised.
1770579	1773942	I'm not surprised all they're they're saying Nope, this was this was Xbox.
1773942	1779306	And I I do see even with these other four games are talking about going multi platform.
1779306	1781888	They've all been out for a year.
1781888	1787072	And usually a game sells what it's going to sell to the fans in a first year.
1787072	1790534	And then everything after that is just icing on the cake.
1790534	1794898	Look at the Sony stuff like that, like a Final Fantasy seven remake.
1795800	1796161	and Matt.
1809730	1816035	It's still gonna mean a lot to have something exclusive for a period of time on the Microsoft platform.
1816035	1817376	I don't know.
1817376	1821038	Sj100mat says the game still has a lot of problems that they're still working on.
1821038	1824861	The last thing they want to do is getting it on other consoles when they're too busy working to fix it.
1824861	1826963	So maybe the timing's not right for this announcement.
1826963	1828003	I don't know.
1828003	1832227	But I just, I will say, I wouldn't have seen the harm.
1832227	1838031	I think if they said we had five games going multi-platform and Starfield was one of them, I would have said, yep, makes perfect sense.
1839986	1842631	And I still would have said this is a hamburger with nothing on it.
1842631	1846919	This is not as big of a deal as everybody was making it out to be.
1846919	1850886	This is not Microsoft goes Sega and this whole thing.
1853683	1857988	But we'll see how the strategy continues to work out for them.
1857988	1866717	I do think, you know, as cloud gaming gets more and more popular, it's going to be a very big disruptor in what we think of as far as traditional hardware.
1866717	1869720	And I sort of see Microsoft is ahead of the curve on some of that.
1869720	1871542	So we'll see.
1871542	1872203	We'll see what develops.
1875561	1881266	Starfield Game of the Year Editions with expansions releasing in 2025 for PCs, Xbox, and PS5.
1881266	1881987	Maybe.
1881987	1884069	Probably.
1884069	1888733	When Starfield will be out of Early Access, it will be on other places like Skyrim.
1888733	1890535	Ouch.
1890535	1891096	How true.
1893779	1901857	Enough about the Xbox drama now that we know, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week with How Was Your Gaming Week.
1901857	1903080	So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1903080	1903781	How was your gaming week?
1905251	1906892	Um, it was pretty good.
1906892	1912314	I played the last bit of the Dead by Daylight, Lights Out, and I loved it.
1912314	1916775	I really had such a good time with it.
1916775	1920157	Although, I pretty much played nothing but pig and hag.
1920157	1921357	I think I played a hag game.
1921357	1922317	I, um...
1925768	1927109	What else?
1927109	1930152	Of course I've played Genshin Impact.
1930152	1935237	I haven't decided on which RPG I'm going to play next.
1935237	1940701	I might go back and just start over on Star Ocean, but I'm kind of not feeling it.
1940701	1946487	So since I don't have a game in mind for Retro Night, I'm just playing Genshin Impact.
1946487	1949049	So it's been super fun.
1949049	1949770	Played a little pinball.
1952898	1954920	Genshin Impact and Dead by Daylight
1970117	1970657	You know what?
1970657	1975379	Start with, well, I'm assuming you mean Battle Royale within Fortnite.
1975379	1980761	I was gonna say start with Lego Fortnite, because it's a completely different game.
1980761	1982361	And it's really, I think it's fun.
1982361	1983402	And then of course, there's Fortnite Festival.
1983402	1985423	I want to play with my friends.
1985423	1987143	Okay, well, yeah, then.
1987143	1988564	Well, you can play Lego Fortnite.
1988564	1989104	But I get it.
1989104	1991325	If they're all playing the Battle Royale, then you would be in there too.
1991325	1991665	I get it.
1991665	1991945	I get it.
1993226	1999089	So yeah, although like I would just like nothing but like a build mode.
1999089	2000910	I want to do nothing but build.
2000910	2004712	But like in the normal version and not Lego-ish.
2004712	2007953	I believe you can do that in a creative mode.
2007953	2010915	Like people have their own islands and stuff.
2010915	2012196	I want to say that's a thing.
2012196	2013596	I'm not super familiar with it.
2013596	2016438	But you know, if that's a thing, sign me up.
2016438	2020960	Yeah, look at look at some of the more like artistic things they put in Fortnite sometimes.
2020960	2022281	I think you'll find your jam in there.
2023081	2024141	So, okay.
2024141	2025262	Yeah, we'll see.
2025262	2026122	Cool.
2026122	2034625	If somebody in chat is a little more familiar with it than I am, by all means, be very curious to refer Jamie to that type of stuff.
2034625	2042748	So, but I'm also waiting for Islands of Insight to get a GeForce version so I can play it because I've been excited about that.
2042748	2044248	Okay.
2044248	2044769	All right.
2044769	2047870	The new behavior MMO.
2047870	2048430	Oh, okay.
2048430	2050390	Thanks.
2050390	2051291	Loki, we'll go to you.
2051291	2051911	How was your gaming week?
2053612	2057255	My week was finishing up my video that is playing behind me now.
2057255	2065000	So I have a new episode out now that was on the Fever Dream SMP, which took place back in January.
2065000	2072505	It is kind of tying in with the Channel 64 SMP in the sense that I have lore that kind of starts off there.
2072505	2076588	Essentially, the whole thing, I mean, like it sounds, it's a fever dream.
2076588	2079070	So as that SMP went on, it was
2079790	2080951	more and more chaotic.
2080951	2084153	They kept adding more things that were strange in it.
2084153	2087015	And so my video is also very strange.
2087015	2089877	It is the complete opposite of the content that I normally make.
2089877	2097662	It is kind of a satire on the modern Minecraft YouTuber, I guess, if you will.
2097662	2108549	You know, the quick, the over editing, the shouting at the camera, the constant calls to action for like subscribing and liking stuff.
2108549	2108689	It's
2110530	2112672	It's interesting, but it's also funny.
2112672	2114192	No, I thought it was great parody.
2114192	2114873	I watched it.
2114873	2115993	I thought it was great parody.
2115993	2117314	You're funny.
2117314	2124518	Yeah, so it's it's, you know, it gets dark in parts and stuff, but it's also going to tie in, like I said, with our season.
2124518	2126399	So it works out in that sense.
2126399	2128600	And so I think it's been it was good.
2128600	2129401	I liked it.
2129401	2136745	I was hoping that it would pop off a bit more than it did, because, you know, I thought that for sure that thumbnail be very clickbaity and
2137185	2140349	And we built it by community, which was fun.
2140349	2147077	You know, lots of people suggesting all sorts of red arrows to put on it and everything, just to a ridiculous extent.
2147077	2148719	So it's been a lot of fun.
2148719	2154647	And then I've been working on designing my dark
2155428	2179111	My water dark ride that I've got so I'm doing a theme park this season and I'm going through the process to design rides like you would an actual like theme park ride so including all the theming and everything like that so I've been working on a water ride a dark ride that's kind of similar to like not Pirates of the Caribbean but in that sense like you know your Disney rides where you're in a boat and water and stuff
2179851	2184936	Um, and you're supposed to be target shooting raccoons that have taken over a lumber mill.
2184936	2189360	And there's like a, it's just, you're not like killing them.
2189360	2190581	You're just capturing them.
2190581	2193503	And then, you know, I mean, you're not killing them.
2193503	2195105	You're just, you know, no, no, seriously.
2195105	2197046	Like you're not supposed, you're not killing them.
2197046	2204473	I mean, they're not, they're not even really raccoons essentially, but, um, it, it's just, it's a silly ride and that hopefully,
2205154	2205855	Thank you for watching!
2221314	2222394	Thank you for watching!
2249938	2255760	Uh, well, if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which was pretty, you know, I, I play a lot of Final Fantasy 14.
2255760	2259121	Uh, so, you know, uh, again, one of my friends recently started playing that IRL.
2259121	2263322	So I've been helping him through the game and just, you know, doing a lot of roulettes and stuff like that.
2263322	2266363	Um, working on my Dark Knight is level 89 now.
2266363	2269944	So it's one level before cap and just, you know, working on the different stuff in that game.
2269944	2273325	I made my mini goals and honestly, that has been really the bulk of my week.
2273325	2274505	I haven't played a lot of other stuff.
2275165	2301135	I know, yes, there was an expansion to No Man's Sky, sort of, a patch, I shouldn't say expansion, a patch, which is usually the type of thing I get right on there and stream right away, but just with how busy everything has been between, you know, prepping for crews, day job stuff, and my dad's stuff all going on at once, there just, there really has not been room for that type of stuff, but I look forward very much to checking that all out when I get back from my trip along with Final Fantasy VII
2301835	2302275	Rebirth
2322885	2329309	Remember Rock Band 3, which had a keyboard or if you want to go way back to Bomani Games, Drum Mania, right?
2329309	2331050	Keyboard Mania was always my jam.
2331050	2332291	I loved Keyboard Mania.
2332291	2333651	I love Keyboard Rock Band 3.
2333651	2341316	And so I'm so happy that they're putting more synthesizer and keyboard songs and really general like pop songs into Fortnite Festival.
2341316	2348080	Just yesterday in the rotation, they had what Into You by Ariana Grande, some Selena Gomez song I never heard, but it was actually good.
2348080	2349181	I liked it.
2349181	2350962	And What Is Love by Hadaway.
2351482	2354885	I wonder if you did keyboard stuff if it would work with a MIDI keyboard?
2371418	2373539	Sadly, because there's only five lanes.
2373539	2377882	I mean, maybe because of the rock band, there was only five lanes in most modes.
2377882	2380144	I think there was like a real keyboard mode, if I remember right.
2380144	2382745	But most of the time you played, you had the same five lane thing.
2382745	2385647	So maybe it could do a similar thing to rock band three.
2385647	2391731	But that's actually a really good question for when they release the plastic instruments and that whole thing.
2391731	2395713	But I would assume that your guitar just becomes your keyboard.
2395713	2398875	But I would be thrilled if they would have like a little keyboard.
2398875	2399396	I mean, I have.
2400436	2408500	I have a USB MIDI keyboard that like, if I could do keyboard parts, like on a keyboard, maybe I'd actually learn how to use it.
2408500	2410981	I of course, I'm sitting here going, I would be thrilled.
2410981	2414562	But then I also know myself, I'd use it like twice and be like, that was fun.
2414562	2422126	And now it just, you know, is this extra thing I have, you know, in my, in my room, but I think one of our emails tonight gets into this later.
2422126	2423707	So we'll, we'll save that for them.
2423707	2424367	We actually have email.
2424947	2425848	Uh huh.
2425848	2430572	But that's, that's it for really my gaming week was just those two things.
2430572	2433394	So looking forward to when I get back and starting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
2433394	2437758	So all right, let's get into more gaming news.
2437758	2442642	And oh, hey, you know what talking about rumors served us so well last week.
2442642	2444724	But here's the thing.
2444724	2445064	I know,
2446411	2451593	Sometimes, you know, it's like, why would you talk about rumors on a gaming news podcast?
2451593	2454255	I've never said this is a gaming news podcast.
2454255	2459057	This is the show where we talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
2459057	2465640	And I would say these types of rumors and things that go around social media, especially when they catch fire and all that stuff.
2465640	2466920	Bobby says at me next time.
2466920	2467921	This is at everyone.
2467921	2470142	It's not at one specific person.
2470142	2471923	But if you believe it applies, apply it.
2473069	2492903	But anyway, but no, all joking aside, like, you know, that's especially when things catch this type of fire that, because even when I first read this, I was like, I rolled my eyes and I was like, whatever, this is like some random website in Brazil talking about this, but, but now like, it won't go away.
2492903	2499588	Like it keeps catching fire and it feels like everything is starting to collaborate with this, where there might be some sense of truth to this.
2499588	2502630	Loki, I'll let you clarify what we're talking about here.
2503228	2511449	Yeah, so apparently the rumor is that the Nintendo Switch successor is going to be coming out next year, or been pushed back.
2511449	2512490	I don't know if it's been pushed back.
2512490	2515790	Did anyone really think it was coming out this year?
2515790	2531493	But apparently, so we have, of course, you know, that Brazilian publication that found the information they said from five sources, then that got backed up later on by from Eurogamer, which also heard similar things from their sources.
2532133	2534054	That's when I paid attention, for the record.
2534054	2537917	When Eurogamer collaborated, I was like, oh, okay, shit, there might be something here.
2537917	2553907	And then VGC also collaborated as well, saying their sources have, that publications have been told that, or I should say, publishers have been told that Nintendo has been pushing the console to launch in Q1 2025.
2553907	2556749	So I could see that, you know, March,
2558021	2560042	That's kind of when the Switch came out.
2560042	2563683	So yeah, I I don't think there's any problem with a first quarter launch.
2563683	2566784	Nintendo has shown it doesn't fucking matter when they put out a new console.
2566784	2567984	People are going to buy it.
2567984	2571086	That that part isn't the surprising part.
2571086	2578328	It's just I think it's the fact that really everybody's expectations has been 2024 Nintendo.
2578328	2583810	It's really time to catch up on technology and they're letting it slip further.
2583810	2584790	It's surprising.
2584790	2586511	Yeah, but it's not.
2587259	2588520	I understand the long game is important.
2605250	2607170	They thought it was launching strongly.
2607170	2612031	It wasn't, because again, it was a bunch of stuff that had already been out for a year.
2612031	2616092	Remember their strategic key partnership with EA that was launched?
2616092	2618553	And then that fucking fizzled so fucking fast.
2618553	2621813	My God, EA left them at the altar after like 60 days.
2621813	2623074	It was wild.
2623074	2625614	But anyway, you know, they didn't have the long game.
2625614	2633336	They didn't have that year of releases to keep things going and keep the Wii U buoyed throughout those early years.
2633336	2634776	And it just tumbled down the hill from there.
2635296	2640492	So if they are delaying it to make sure that the chess pieces are aligned so that way...
2641513	2647678	There's games that come out in March, a game in April, a game in May, a game in June, because that's kind of what they did with the Switch.
2647678	2661049	If you look at the release patterns, yes, it released in March, but they made sure whether it was them or a third party partner, they had a major release coming in April, May, June, July, August, they made sure they were doing one a month.
2661049	2668576	And I think that might be why this delay in the moment feels a little concerning because, well, then what are they going to do this year?
2670100	2673242	And maybe the answer is they don't really have to do shit.
2673242	2675563	Like, you know, the switch is still selling Nintendo.
2675563	2677204	It's done well.
2677204	2679025	Um, you know what they could do?
2679025	2686249	They could finally put the fucking Netflix paramount plus those apps on it, you know, but I guess it's gone.
2686249	2687590	It's gone this long without it.
2687590	2688170	Who needs it?
2688170	2689991	I guess, you know, but I don't know.
2689991	2692153	No, I, I would anticipate.
2693365	2699651	We get something that's going to be easy for them to throw together, which sounds really bad.
2699651	2706297	I don't so mean it that way, but I mean like a Wii U remaster, which I know what's left.
2706297	2707358	There's not a lot left.
2707358	2707838	The Wonderful 101.
2709181	2710081	Maybe?
2710081	2712242	They can remaster the remasters.
2712242	2713523	Remaster Wind Waker.
2713523	2714803	No, I'll tell you exactly what it is.
2714803	2718165	ZWA Chronicles X, that one, the one that was Wii U exclusive.
2718165	2719486	That will be one of them.
2719486	2728389	It could be something that they could they could very easily buff up and put out for the holiday or something like that.
2728389	2736453	But that's if that's what the holiday releases start looking like, then, you know, yeah, that's that's what happened is this thing is definitely delayed to 2025.
2736453	2738014	But can you really delay?
2739048	2742909	a game, a console that was never announced in the first place.
2742909	2754073	I mean, no, that's what I say is like, you know, delayed in the sense that maybe you were expecting in 2024, but no one said anything about it coming out in 2024 or even being announced in 2024.
2754073	2757355	It's just that, you know, that was the assumption, I guess.
2757355	2758355	Yeah, it's been a while.
2758755	2761677	SJ100 Matt in chat says, yeah, there's some smoke to this rumor.
2761677	2766020	Nintendo did nothing holiday window 2016 and they were just fine.
2766020	2768702	Well, they weren't fine.
2768702	2770563	The Wii U was kind of tanking.
2770563	2772024	It is a slightly different.
2772024	2772905	I mean, I get what you're saying.
2772905	2775506	Yes, they ended up OK in the long run, and that's what's important.
2775506	2778648	But the Wii U is in a very different place than where the Switch is now.
2778648	2779029	Right.
2779029	2780550	And so there is a little bit of a difference there.
2780550	2784172	But yeah, if Nintendo kind of.
2784172	2786294	Oh, no, it just hit me.
2787182	2788943	This is what this is what they'll do.
2788943	2791964	This is how Nintendo salvages their holiday period.
2791964	2794185	It's gonna have nothing to do with the switch.
2794185	2796226	They're gonna put out a new classic system.
2796226	2797107	Guaranteed.
2797107	2798087	That's what they'll do.
2798087	2800568	They'll do one of the they'll do an emulation hardware thing.
2800568	2807892	Remember, like the NES classic SNES classic, maybe a Game Boy, a disk system classic.
2808666	2809267	I can't hear Rob.
2827763	2835310	Gameboy Classic, N64 Classic, and I said maybe even an NES Classic Volume 2 or an SNES Classic Volume 2.
2835310	2837112	Like what's to stop them from doing that?
2837112	2838233	People would pick that up as well.
2838233	2840035	And then you said a disc classic as well.
2840035	2844979	Yeah, they'll do the top loader system.
2844979	2848263	You joke, but yes, it will be that.
2850885	2857069	And it will have different games, maybe that they've worked with third-party publishers, and maybe repeat some of the classics in there as well.
2857069	2861692	I don't think that they would, because I think it would devalue... I mean, maybe.
2861692	2863914	Like, Game Boy, I could... I don't know.
2863914	2870678	I still think that their path now is that they want to push people to Nintendo Switch Online in the expansion path, so...
2872458	2881874	I think it's a great idea because, you know, Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass is only $25 in a year, whereas the console, they could sell it for $100, but I don't know.
2881874	2882195	We'll see.
2882694	2885157	Yeah, respectfully, totally disagree.
2885157	2889601	The NES classic and the SNES classic didn't do a damn thing to sales or cannibalize.
2889601	2903056	People still wanted those things and I think if they did an N64 classic or a top loader NES classic or a Game Boy, which would be the three likely candidates to me, as a fan, now as a fan, DarkSakura,
2903616	2907217	I would love, love exactly what you're talking about.
2907217	2912619	A disc system with a bunch of games that have never been released in the U.S.
2912619	2913700	or something like that.
2913700	2926044	Or just, you know, most people have never, even though you can do it on the Switch's virtual console or whatever, I'm sorry, the Switch Online, you can play Metroid with the extra sound chip.
2926044	2929686	They'll put it, they can do a whole- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, like an FM series.
2929686	2929906	Yes.
2929906	2933067	Or maybe even coordinate with Sega.
2935012	2938914	and actually do a good master system mini.
2953281	2958266	I already have the Famicom Mini.
2958266	2963450	Bobby Blackwolf points out, my in-laws have an NES Classic because my mother-in-law grew up playing NES games.
2963450	2965472	She doesn't want to switch, it's too complex.
2965472	2967714	There's still a lot they could do with an NES Classic.
2967714	2976622	Keep in mind, just piggybacking right on Bobby Blackwolf's comment about they have an NES Classic because they grew up playing NES games.
2977742	2987233	There is a huge game that everybody grew up playing that has never been in one of these releases, and it's not on Switch Online either.
2987233	2989295	Duck Hunt.
2989295	2990957	That's the one.
2990957	2993781	Because guns are hard to do when you don't have a CRT.
2995305	2995645	but now
3013550	3014590	That's that's it.
3014590	3015891	I'm a I'm a genius.
3015891	3017691	Mark my words.
3017691	3019351	That is Nintendo's holiday plan.
3019351	3022892	They're going to put out a new classic or some type of hardware thing.
3022892	3026613	And that will be the thing that moves hardware when the switch is having an off year.
3026613	3032135	But they'll still they'll still do the the Wii U release or something like that will still be a thing.
3032135	3033515	But that'll that'll be it.
3037232	3044217	DarkTetsuya says Duck Hunt showed up on Wii U with Wiimote support, so if they could figure that out for a mini, sure.
3044217	3051102	And Bobby Blackwolf says, there is a way to do light gun games on modern LCDs, Arcade1Up figured it out.
3051102	3053283	Yes, and I think we have another light gun story coming up later.
3053283	3056025	I mean, to be fair, you could take one of those.
3056025	3056886	Remember the Wii
3059307	3061250	What was it, the Wii console that they put out?
3061250	3073946	Like, the very end of the life cycle of the Wii that had, like, no internet access, like, no GameCube backwards compatibility and stuff like that, and they were selling it for, like, I think it was, it was under, like, a hundred bucks, I think.
3073946	3075568	It wasn't the Wii, it was the Wii.
3077186	3077707	Right.
3077707	3078808	It was the Wii.
3078808	3080390	Yeah, it was.
3080390	3081191	I don't remember what they called it.
3081191	3082212	They called it something different.
3082212	3084955	It was the Wii, but it had like an extra name on it.
3084955	3086516	They could repurpose that.
3086516	3091422	I mean, that thing could emulate, obviously, Nintendo games since it did.
3091422	3095186	And then you have a light gun right there because you have the Wii remotes.
3096026	3103231	And to be fair to DarkSakura's original point about the fact that Duck Hunt would have to be repurposed, in a sense, to run now.
3103231	3105932	I'm just stating why it hadn't been done to this date.
3105932	3106232	Right.
3106232	3117599	But it's also one of the things, to that point, is that the NES classic, the SES classic, they were nice, they were cute, but they were just ROMs thrown on a piece of hardware.
3117599	3121962	Nintendo, if they really went in, think about the rich trove
3122722	3125323	of things that Nintendo is sitting on that they could do.
3125323	3134508	Seriously, they could do some of their satellites, Teleview games, now that those are all back, and they could do something that incorporates all of those.
3134508	3140311	They could do- And all they have to do is work with the fan translators, because like some of those games have already been fully dumped and translated.
3140311	3142632	There was the thing we talked about F-Zero last week.
3142632	3142892	Right.
3142892	3148475	Well, there's legal reasons they don't do that, but it would- I don't think it would be very hard for them to translate internally.
3149804	3157430	But I mean, they've done it before, like they've put out the like they did Star Fox 2, you know, finally gave us a full release of that.
3157430	3158110	Oh, yeah.
3158110	3158631	No, you're right.
3158631	3159231	You're right.
3159231	3163254	They they've got all of the material for the Satellaview games.
3163254	3173582	I would think that, you know, if they see how popular that ended up being, maybe they would translate some of the Satellaview games or put them in a standard play version.
3173582	3173782	Yeah.
3174381	3178623	I've been saying this for years.
3178623	3184865	I would love for Nintendo to embrace the randomizer concept with some of their old games.
3184865	3187286	They don't have to use the literal stuff that's out there now.
3187286	3191247	Nintendo could come up with their own thing to do a true randomizer for something like Metroid
3191767	3218494	or Zelda 1 or you know all these games that get this treatment and I think that would be so much fun and people would be so into that so I I feel like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit Nintendo could do to make something that would be very mildly interesting for the holiday that they just they just have to do it so we'll see but anyway yes if this if the switch is delayed then fine whatever they're doing it for the right reasons and even though we sit here going wow 2024 is gonna suck
3220686	3224687	Nintendo's position strongly for 2025, so what does it matter in the long game?
3224687	3229989	But I'm just saying 2024 doesn't have to suck, Nintendo.
3229989	3232029	We'll see what happens.
3232029	3237251	Dr. C in chat says this reminds me I saw an article on one of the blogs about NES Remix.
3237251	3238891	They should bring that back in some form.
3238891	3241172	Hell yes, NES Remix was awesome.
3241172	3243393	That was a lot of fun.
3243393	3247634	All right, let's move on and talk about this headline that kind of
3248939	3268165	Kinda slipped under a little bit considering all the things going on with Xbox, but how different at its core, really, is this comment, besides the obvious, from Sony President Hiroki Totoki, who was talking recently in an earnings call Q&A session.
3268165	3276087	He was asked about Sony's profits not keeping up with increasing gross income, and he mentioned that hardware and first-party games were areas of focus,
3276687	3283089	Hardware cost reduction was difficult to come by, so don't expect the price of a PS5 to drop.
3283089	3294051	But then goes on to say, I personally think there are opportunities out there for improvement of margin, so I would like to go aggressive on improving our margin performance.
3294051	3301593	In the past, we wanted to popularize consoles, and a first-party title's main purpose was to make the console popular.
3302253	3304994	This is true, but there's a synergy to it.
3304994	3320021	If you have strong first party content, not only on our console, but also other platforms like computers, a first party game can be grown with multi platform, and that can help operating profit to improve.
3320021	3322823	So that's another one we want to proactively work on.
3323911	3327814	So Sony also talking about multi-platform.
3327814	3330856	Granted, not Xbox, not Switch.
3330856	3331737	Sure.
3331737	3334639	But look at that quote and what he's saying.
3334639	3337321	Is it that different from Xbox?
3337321	3340503	Xbox is just taking this road to get to that point.
3340503	3343285	Sony is taking a different road to get to that point.
3343285	3350451	But it's at the same at the end of the day, it's a first party game can be grown with multi-platform and that can help the overall profit to improve.
3352202	3354998	It's just- But wait, where are the people throwing away their PlayStation 5s?
3356584	3365532	They're not gonna because, well, actually, Loki, to be fair, when they first went to Steam and PC, we saw the YouTube hysteria on that front.
3365532	3366713	That did happen.
3366713	3372177	To be completely fair, Sony fanboys are just as insufferable as the Xbox ones, okay?
3372177	3374479	They're all bad.
3374479	3379223	But yeah, and this far along, does it really matter at the end of the day?
3379223	3381805	Has it really killed the PlayStation exclusives?
3381805	3382006	No.
3383663	3398863	But, he did point out, in 2022, at the time, he said PC gamers would have to wait at least a year to play things like God of War 2018, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Miles Morales was actually a two year turnaround.
3400285	3411271	Something to note, Helldivers 2, a Sony game, just came out on February 8th on PlayStation 5 and Windows, and it's doing very well.
3411271	3412792	We'll talk about that again later in the show.
3412792	3418415	In fact, it is doing better than they expected it to do, which is very interesting.
3418415	3419416	So now again,
3420416	3426458	Unlike Microsoft, Sony didn't name any specifics because this was more of an asterisk during a Q&A at the call.
3426458	3429298	So we don't know if we're talking about like, does this mean Wolverine?
3429298	3432479	Does this mean, you know, a potential future Naughty Dog game or anything?
3432479	3435580	Because we all know Last of Us 3 is going to happen eventually.
3435580	3437060	We don't know yet.
3437060	3443362	But it is very interesting that Sony also sees the benefit of going multi platform.
3443362	3444062	And I think that is
3445404	3449747	that I think that window of the year might get a little smaller, but not too much.
3449747	3454429	I don't I don't know if we see a lot of same day and date, like we're seeing with Helldivers 2.
3454429	3461033	But maybe, maybe the Helldivers 2 is a very interesting because I that game was not on my radar at all.
3461033	3465216	And now it's, I feel like lots of people are talking about that.
3465216	3468418	So anyway, let's move on.
3468418	3470919	DarkSakura, I know you love to talk about classics here.
3470919	3473421	And this is definitely something with the classics, right?
3474662	3479525	Well, Rob, are you familiar with the term, um, kusoge?
3479525	3481606	Uh, no.
3481606	3484268	Kuso means shit.
3484268	3487930	Basically, it means shitty game.
3487930	3497576	So, they have, there is a translation patch for a Dreamcast light gun game that is a pretty shitty game.
3499713	3508396	But it does have some notable music to it, and it's just got a lot of stuff to it.
3508396	3519479	But it's called Death Crimson II, Altar of Melanito, and there is an English patch put out for it.
3519479	3523440	Yeah, and Bobby points out about the Cuso Grande,
3525072	3529175	which is, you know, same thing.
3529175	3539563	But there's also cheat codes that let you use the L and R trigger to increase your credit counts and change your timer.
3539563	3549771	But there's a patch online that you can go get from Derek Pascarella, P-A-S-C-A-R-E-L-L-A, on...
3555703	3556504	and Bobby Blackwolf
3582403	3590888	We were watching that just on their channel as like, it was like an ongoing thing just on the channel itself.
3590888	3593390	We would sometimes watch and go, hey, I know that game.
3593390	3594591	Yeah.
3594591	3595752	Yeah.
3595752	3596972	All right.
3596972	3598974	Well, let's move on.
3598974	3599194	Loki.
3600946	3602007	Uh, yes.
3602007	3603368	Um, it's funny.
3603368	3604209	I mean, it's not funny.
3604209	3608652	None of this is funny, but it, it reminds me of EA in a sense.
3608652	3613696	So Embracer has canceled nearly 30 unannounced games in the last six months.
3615938	3626686	And if you think about it, it's very, this feels a lot like EA and how they used to basically buy up studios and then those studios just go under.
3626686	3629348	But except they're just speed running this now.
3629348	3631550	So apparently the last physical report,
3632990	3633470	Disgusting.
3662914	3679233	and I and all these people who had nothing to do with that decision are the ones that are having to pay for it and it's just it's just so gross the entire mismanagement of the whole thing like I almost feel like certain executives should be personally accountable for some of this stuff it's so bad
3680037	3682158	Absolutely, I would imagine.
3682158	3684080	I would love to see that lawsuit happen.
3684080	3687402	Although, you know, technically, I think a lot of those executives aren't based here.
3687402	3688263	I think it's overseas.
3688263	3689723	So it gets complicated.
3689723	3695908	But it's just it's just really gross to see how horribly mismanaged the whole thing was.
3695908	3700811	Buying all this stuff just to shut it all down sucks.
3700811	3703753	Anyway, I don't care as long as they still have their money.
3705031	3707812	Well, let's talk about something that's completely different.
3707812	3716216	Let's talk about a company that knows how to keep a good thing going and support, support, support a game with free patches, even though you bought it one time.
3716216	3721759	And sure, maybe when you first bought it, it wasn't great, but it's hard to say that this game isn't in a great place now.
3721759	3723940	And that, of course, is No Man's Sky.
3723940	3727782	And I have to admit, I was kind of wondering, like, when's the next patch coming?
3727782	3728662	It's been a minute.
3728662	3732484	And sure enough, this week, in comes the Omega patch.
3733064	3738549	And is the Omega patch, a lot of folks wondering, is the Omega patch the final patch for No Man's Sky?
3738549	3740391	Because it's called Omega.
3740391	3741692	I don't think so, folks.
3741692	3746997	I think it's called that because some of the elements of this actually affect the ending.
3746997	3752282	They changed the Atlas ending a little bit to have a little more choice with it, but...
3755825	3770809	Hello Games has kind of said that they're not ending No Man's Sky support because of Light No Fire, which you know, of course, the folks that made No Man's Sky are working on a kind of single planet sort of game called Light No Fire at this point.
3770809	3774130	And they have explicitly said they're not stopping No Man's Sky.
3774130	3778471	It might get scaled back a little bit, but they're still going to continue on that game.
3778471	3780671	So I don't think Omega needs ending at this point.
3780671	3783792	I think there would have been a lot more fanfare if that was going to be the case.
3783792	3783912	But
3784312	3785494	Oh, excuse me.
3785494	3788138	But what else is sorry how to root beer.
3788138	3793044	But what I think is very interesting is that the game actually was free to play this weekend.
3793044	3796870	I'm sorry to say by the time most of you are hearing this, that free to play window is done.
3796870	3797911	So you probably missed it.
3797911	3799253	But the game was free to play.
3800635	3801056	Twitch Twitch Drops
3818115	3846475	there is a new expedition and it sounds like they've already kind of really changed up the expedition system so instead of having to create a whole new game a whole new save file for the expedition you can fire up the expedition in your existing save which is a very big quality of life thing for a lot of people that want to like have their main save and not all these sub saves and all that so that's pretty cool and then they're doing um a brand new ship type uh there's a really cool staff that they have now in place of a multi-tool so you can look like a
3846775	3847495	Big Pirate Fleets
3859216	3863837	QuestBuster says it was wild seeing so many people in the player hubs.
3878982	3881123	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3899292	3904674	and so like I'm going to have maybe a week when I get back and I want to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
3904674	3912337	So I might miss this one, but I'm going to try not to because I love No Man's Sky is just one of my go to comfort games.
3912337	3913897	It's my comfort food.
3913897	3916358	It's my it's my Taco Bell.
3916358	3922101	I don't eat it every day, but once in a while I crave it and I want it and I go play it.
3922101	3924221	So there's that.
3924221	3925442	All right.
3925442	3928503	DarkSakura with another cool little classic update.
3932949	3939202	Switch had a new release on the 15th and that is the
3941938	3945481	East for the PC-8801.
3945481	3950224	As in, it's a very different... Well, actually, I take that back.
3950224	3954707	East... I was thinking of Valis, never mind.
3954707	3960991	But it's still... It's the original... One of the original versions of East.
3960991	3961791	It's gonna be $6.49.
3961791	3965134	It's a small little game.
3965134	3971038	But it's the game that began the East series put out by Nihon Falcom.
3971958	3975759	So definitely it's worth it.
3975759	3980281	I mean, my jam was YS III and I like the series.
3980281	3984802	So if you want to know where now we're like what on YS IX, something like that.
3984802	3987763	I want to say X. Are we?
3987763	3988603	I lost.
3988603	3991704	I want to say I saw like YX.
3991704	3995005	I know it's YS, but YX.
3995005	3995806	I could be wrong.
3995806	3996986	I thought I saw a thing of that.
3998348	4001291	At any rate, you can go back and play the original.
4001291	4010022	And it's actually been dubbed Egg Console East PC 8801 Mark 2 SR.
4010022	4010943	Sounds like Iron Man's arm.
4012607	4018894	DarkSakura in chat says, I'm tempted to get it just to show the wife some of the early Falcom stuff.
4018894	4022678	And apparently it's still in Japanese, but I'm sure Google Translate might help.
4022678	4033529	Um, oh, well, actually, um, the, um, the menus and how to play is all in English, but the main gaming gallery is in Japanese.
4034150	4037533	Okay, so they translate as the the necessary stuff to get through the game.
4037533	4039435	It sounds like interesting.
4039435	4046541	Well, yeah, I mean, you won't really unless you know enough Japanese to kind of get the gist of the conversation.
4046541	4048703	You know, you will be missing out on some story.
4048703	4057652	But that's still a cool thing for them to release like just and I get you know, Dr. Seuss comment like just almost wanting to buy it just to support this and see this kind of thing.
4057652	4057952	No, do
4058152	4059994	And I do think that is important.
4059994	4065578	Like if this kind of like really like, let's be honest, this is a deep dive in classics.
4065578	4070902	This is not I realize ease is a great thing for a lot of people as are these, you know, Japanese consoles.
4070902	4072624	But you know, like, let's be real.
4072624	4074565	We're not talking about Mario Brothers or Zelda.
4074565	4076366	We're not talking about a re-release of a huge game.
4076366	4078168	We're talking about something that's rather pretty niche.
4078508	4080549	EZ10 Nordics has a page on Steam and is coming out here later
4107222	4111005	I know, I know, I know it makes you all shiver, but it's funny.
4111005	4112806	It's funny.
4112806	4113907	What, Rob?
4113907	4114568	What?
4114568	4117310	All right.
4117310	4119091	No.
4119091	4120172	Moving on, Loki.
4122104	4130671	We have some news regarding a lawsuit against Activision by Optics Gaming.
4130671	4133673	I'm not too familiar with all of this.
4133673	4135995	This is more of the Call of Duty league.
4135995	4138537	It's their professional esports gaming league.
4139518	4141921	And kind of some of the stuff that went along with that.
4141921	4152011	So kind of for context, apparently before the Call of Duty League, there were other professional Call of Duty kind of tournament setups that were out there.
4152011	4154914	Of course, once Activision purchased
4157526	4167833	Some of the competing leagues, they kind of got it down to almost where it was more of a monopoly on the whole competitive space.
4167833	4172777	And so because of that, they were able to leverage some deals that
4174438	4179443	that apparently they found were not beneficial to them.
4179443	4191274	So as such, for example, the founder of the group said that Activision forced him to sell the majority of his company in addition to a $27.5 million entry fee to get into the Call of Duty League.
4196459	4207007	and also that they demanded an unconstitutional 50% share of the revenue the teams generated from ticket sales, sponsorships, and other revenue streams.
4207007	4217676	Along with that, also accusing them of basically forcing players to sign a contract without them being able to run it by their lawyers.
4218977	4220839	do you think there's a case here Loki?
4237600	4239301	I don't know.
4239301	4240601	I don't know if there is or not.
4240601	4252527	It sounds to me, this reminds me a lot of like the whole Smash scene and kind of like the stuff that they're, the regulations Nintendo's putting on people that are running tournaments and stuff like that.
4252527	4259390	To a lesser extent, obviously this is much larger than that when we're talking $680 million where some of these Smash tournaments are.
4261007	4261568	Thanks for watching!
4275247	4276648	Fair enough.
4276648	4281152	Sjohn100mat says, yeah, this and the Overwatch League ended in such disaster.
4281152	4285856	It's kind of a bummer to see this sort of setback for gaming sports.
4285856	4286216	I don't know.
4286216	4294824	I realize people feel some sorts of ways about it, but I, as somebody who was picked on a lot growing up, and I, there's a lot of you that share this with me.
4294824	4296005	I'm not just talking about myself.
4296445	4311271	As somebody who was picked on a lot growing up because I didn't play sports and I tended to lean more towards video games, seeing video games start to have their place amongst the sports and that type of stuff on, you know, ABC Wild, Wide World of Sports or whatever, kind of felt some sort of way.
4311271	4312812	Wide World of Sports, oh my God.
4312812	4321316	Yeah, it kind of felt some sort of way that felt really good, you know, and it was it's just a bummer that you're having all these setbacks because now it feels like shit.
4322136	4328438	Maybe video games aren't going to be able to hold their own there because we keep having these financial and other types of fuck-ups.
4328438	4336641	Well, to be fair, I mean, in the sports world, they have these same types of arrangements with their players that kind of suck.
4336641	4346665	Like, look at the whole college leagues and everything and the amount of ownership that those players have over their likenesses and even some of the EA games and Madden and stuff like that.
4347125	4359625	you know there's the whole it's very regulated in that sense and sometimes especially for like people that are not necessarily savvy in legal stuff they can get run over by these companies and
4360711	4363193	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4383288	4390133	You know, and it's and it's not to say that regular sports quote unquote don't have their problems as well.
4390133	4394676	Did you all hear the news by the way here here locally in our hometown of Sacramento where we're based?
4394676	4397358	We might suddenly have a Major League Baseball team for two years.
4397358	4398359	Have you heard about this?
4398359	4398919	What?
4398919	4399299	No.
4399299	4400120	Yeah, we know.
4400120	4401541	That's that's the latest rumor going around.
4401541	4404603	Yeah, apparently Vegas isn't ready for the A's.
4404603	4405664	So the A's might move here.
4406204	4407225	for just a couple of years.
4407225	4408725	That's that's the latest thing people are talking about.
4408725	4417910	Because if you think about it, the park over in West Sac that has the River Cats, like it's actually a pretty decent facility that's relatively newer and I've enjoyed games there.
4417910	4418511	Yeah.
4418511	4429577	So like they're talking and the fact that it's, you know, down the street, so to speak, from Oakland, they're talking about the Sacramento is like the leading place to hold the A's for a couple of years before Vegas is ready for them.
4429577	4430878	And that came out of fucking nowhere.
4431772	4434954	But that's because of all the fuckery.
4434954	4435995	I wouldn't mind.
4435995	4436695	No, I wouldn't at all.
4436695	4437996	I think it would be very interesting.
4437996	4445080	But that's because of all the fuckery of the guy that owns the A's and how he was dicking around the city and all this stuff.
4445080	4448403	So we're moving just all the Oakland teams to Vegas now?
4448403	4448563	Yes.
4448563	4449383	Is that what's happening?
4449383	4451444	Yes.
4451444	4453426	That is what is happening.
4453426	4458369	There's no clever comeback or pun or joke to make because yes, that is happening.
4459648	4463629	I would pray they take them somewhere else to train though, cause ugh.
4463629	4464610	Yeah.
4464610	4465450	Yeah.
4465450	4468271	Uh, as Jonah Matt says, yeah, the A's move has become a circus.
4468271	4469171	Hey, but you know what?
4469171	4472192	Maybe we'll like, like DarkSakura said, I'll go, I'll go.
4472192	4472492	Sure.
4472492	4475153	I'll go watch an A's game at the Sutter Park or whatever.
4475153	4475953	I think that's the name.
4475953	4476753	It's Sutter Park, right?
4476753	4477733	It's named after Sutter.
4477733	4477954	Yeah.
4477954	4482395	I've had a good time going to, um, our, our minor league games.
4482395	4482875	Yeah.
4482875	4487216	It's, it's not a bad, it's a smaller facility than a major league stadium.
4487216	4489257	So they're definitely going to take a hit on attendance, but
4490458	4491859	Who is going to A's games anyway?
4491859	4495802	Who told you to move them to Vegas?
4495802	4499384	More people are going to go to them here than we're probably going in Oakland, to be quite honest.
4499384	4504307	I think a lot of people in Sacramento will be like, oh, this is this is a novelty, to be honest.
4504307	4507790	So they're not quite so hot as Las Vegas.
4507790	4508130	No.
4508130	4513794	We're like we're like we're like the Sir Robin of of league towns.
4513794	4513994	Yeah.
4514830	4515511	I think they feed Oakland.
4527659	4531861	Yeah, they were feeding the giant, they feed one of the, they always go back and forth.
4531861	4537064	They're feeding one Bay Area team or the other, but yes, was there like, you know, ground for that.
4537064	4539145	But you know, Sacramento's still trying to get a soccer team too.
4539145	4540146	They've been thinking of that.
4540146	4547650	So, you know, it's been, it's been growing here ever since, ever since they, ever since they put a giant fucking purple laser
4548550	4551351	on top of NotCo Arena downtown.
4551351	4553992	Ever since they put a big purple laser on top of that thing.
4553992	4554752	Let me tell you.
4554752	4556093	NotCo Arena.
4556093	4557853	NotCo Arena downtown.
4557853	4560874	Let me tell you, sports suddenly is like this.
4560874	4563875	This town is just like, wants more sports.
4563875	4565356	And we have a team that's good at sports.
4565356	4571718	And now it's like, wow, we actually have the, you know, infrastructure and the people with all the people relocated to support more sports.
4571718	4574079	I, on the contrary, want more lasers.
4576203	4577964	I want a laser on every roof.
4577964	4578965	Yeah, no, think about it.
4578965	4580265	Think about it, Loki.
4580265	4582766	The Kings could have their laser like the beam.
4582766	4591050	And then the Oakland A's could have a green laser, excuse me, the Sacramento A's or the not not yet Vegas A's could have a green laser like that beam.
4591050	4594352	And then they get to get a soccer team.
4594352	4595732	Light this beam too.
4595732	4599234	We could have like fucking 17 lasers going off in the sky all at once.
4601277	4606522	And I'm sure that there's no concern whatsoever being the flight path for the nearby airport as well.
4606522	4609824	I'm sure that it hasn't stopped the purple laser.
4609824	4612747	Usually, usually planes don't fly right over downtowns anyway.
4612747	4615289	So that's why that's why the laser is not a big deal.
4615289	4616750	So anyway,
4618232	4620093	All right, let's start.
4620093	4622975	Yeah, we have the Nays playing at NotCo Arena.
4622975	4623536	I'm down for that.
4623536	4624356	I'm sorry.
4624356	4628079	I'd like to apologize to the listeners, starting with PodCulture.
4628079	4635705	I'd like to apologize for the fact that even we here at Orange Alliance Radio somehow, after all these years, have succumbed to sports talk.
4635705	4639488	I'd like to apologize, everybody.
4639488	4640549	I'm sorry about that.
4640549	4641770	I was talking about lasers.
4641770	4644032	I never mentioned sports at all.
4644032	4645013	I'll have the record show.
4646969	4650112	I was just using it as an excuse to make fun of team names.
4650112	4653336	I have been a long fan of lasers.
4653336	4657740	Have I not played like thousands of games of laser tag?
4657740	4660303	It's not because I like the competitiveness of it.
4660303	4661764	I'm just a fan of lasers.
4661764	4662825	Lasers are fucking rad.
4662825	4666389	I mean, unless we're talking about like that scene in Resident Evil with the lasers, that's a little scary.
4666389	4670093	But like otherwise, lasers that don't cut people up are pretty cool.
4672059	4674802	and that you don't shine directly in people's eyes because that's not fun either.
4674802	4678025	But you know, the space lasers that just shoot in the sky.
4678025	4680868	That's pretty fun.
4680868	4683270	All right, anyway, moving on.
4683270	4684071	You know what else is fun?
4684071	4685553	Video games.
4685553	4686874	Uh, and- Laser tag.
4686874	4688716	I brought- Yeah, laser tag is fun.
4688716	4689737	We're overdue to do that.
4691363	4694065	Let's talk about a game that's been doing very well lately.
4694065	4695927	It's Helldivers 2.
4695927	4697809	I mentioned this earlier in the show.
4697809	4699310	It is doing very well.
4699310	4707818	It's Arrowhead Games Studios' newest third-person PvE co-op shooter, and it has broken records for PlayStation Studios.
4707818	4708379	It's reached 150,000
4711861	4716043	150,000 concurrent Steam players on its opening weekend and it is still growing.
4716043	4725787	It has now surpassed the all time concurrent player records of several big games like Starfield, Destiny 2, Halo Infinite.
4725787	4732750	Now, I believe that's on Steam, so I sort of feel like that's an unfair comparison to games that a lot of people are consuming on Game Pass.
4732750	4736732	However, I will let the I will let the comments stand because that is still a lot of people.
4739036	4747379	Apparently there are server capacity issues resulting from how popular this game is, as tends to happen with video games when they get unexpectedly popular.
4747379	4756282	Arrowhead has capped Helldiver's two servers to 450,000 concurrent players to try to improve server stability.
4756282	4760263	They say they will continue to work with partners to get the ceiling raised.
4760563	4761664	Helldiver 2 is doing really well
4779444	4787847	I mean, although I will, I will point out for Loki, I noticed when I'm looking at some of like the promo art for this game, and maybe Loki, you can see this with me here.
4787847	4794630	You'll notice that in this promotional shot, we have the three people that are, you know, doing their thing, but what's, what's this one got?
4794630	4796170	What's this one got, Loki?
4796170	4797051	A laser sight.
4797051	4798531	That's right.
4798531	4802033	So maybe, maybe we're missing something, Loki.
4802033	4805574	So it does certainly look like knockoff stormtroopers, but you know, that's just,
4806775	4807715	That's fine.
4807715	4808316	That's fine.
4808316	4809276	Fine.
4809276	4811977	Quest Buster says it's wild how viral the game has gone.
4811977	4812337	Yeah.
4812337	4814298	And SEO 100 Matt says it's the new hotness.
4814298	4816299	Clearly, it needs to be something I put on my radar.
4816299	4819120	But I need to watch some people stream at first.
4819120	4823722	That's usually how I feel about these types of games, especially the ones that are asking for $40.
4823722	4829384	I need to watch somebody stream at first and see is this for me because I can usually tell pretty quick if it's for me or not.
4829384	4829484	So
4830169	4830429	What?
4830429	4837472	You're just not going to like buy into it like some sort of quadruple A game that came out to grave reviews.
4837472	4843114	That game was amazing and totally not worse than the game that came out 11 years ago.
4843114	4849816	Let me tell you, I didn't even, I didn't even realize that game came out if that tells you how well the marketing is behind that game.
4849816	4855819	It is, it's just hilarious like what they, it's so,
4857253	4868203	Like, it's funny because we like think back to like Peter Molyneux and like Molyneux, I guess, and like how like all of the stuff that he said was just a bunch of bullshit.
4868203	4870225	And like, nowadays, it's like that.
4870225	4875029	But like, you have Todd Howard, you have just everything thing coming from Ysgamon.
4875029	4877171	I mean, just it's all bullshit.
4877171	4878512	Just don't believe anybody.
4878512	4879973	Just wait for the game to come out.
4879973	4880674	Don't preorder because
4881174	4883175	They want $70 for that game.
4883175	4884255	It's garbage.
4884255	4904780	It's just it's at very best It's just kind of mid just kind of yeah, whatever, but it's certainly not a quadruple quadruple a game look English is a complicated language Loki and the whole thing was it wasn't a quadruple a game it was a quadruple a Game quadruple a game
4905816	4909958	That's yeah, it's just it's sometimes it's hard to know how to pronounce the vowel.
4909958	4911559	Like it's very, it's very complicated.
4911559	4912719	And that's that's what it is.
4912719	4915200	It's a quadruple a game.
4915200	4915941	Yeah.
4915941	4916421	Makes sense.
4916421	4919042	Yeah.
4919042	4919522	I did.
4919522	4922223	I didn't I didn't even fucking know it came out.
4922223	4924444	What does that tell you?
4924444	4932288	I know it came out because it's fun watching the reviews for it because I know it's going to be just like watching the reviews for like, say, Madam Web or something like that.
4934188	4953521	it's fun because there's a lot of mid stuff happening right now isn't there like what is going on i'm a little afraid for madam webb is a quadruple a movie you just don't understand it's just it goes above everyone's head which is why no no no that no no no loki you have to pronounce the vowels differently there too madam webb is a quadruple
4954261	4954481	Zanadu
4978079	4978360	and Matt.
4990540	4991320	Did I watch it?
4991320	4996103	No, because I am not giving Sony any money for their crappy Spider-Man ripoffs.
4996103	5001627	I'll give them money for Across the Spider-Verse, because that's a good movie.
5001627	5002307	Here's an idea.
5002307	5009051	You should take your good writers and make them make those movies, not take the writers that put out Morbius and said, hey, you know what?
5009051	5012153	I want more of that.
5012153	5013674	Give me some more of that Morbius.
5014554	5020878	And so they have Madame Web now, which like it's a bunch of characters that don't even.
5020878	5026342	So like even the marketing was deceptive with it, too, because they showed like all these different spider women in it and stuff.
5026342	5033267	And really, that's just like kind of a really quick vision that she gets of the future that like takes place in like 30 seconds or something.
5033267	5035668	And the rest of the movie is not that at all.
5035668	5037990	But that's what they show off in the trailers.
5037990	5038130	Hmm.
5039601	5044863	Um, let's see, I wanted to point out pod culture points out Rocky Horror is a bad movie too.
5044863	5047885	Well, like I said, there's a time and a place for bad movies.
5047885	5054647	And plus the thing with Rocky Horror, the whole phenomenon with Rocky Horror has very little to do with the movie actually.
5054647	5057268	It's it's more about the community and the people for sure.
5057268	5058309	But that
5058789	5060752	would be a whole other podcast.
5060752	5069584	For now, let's talk about, hey, we're talking about, you know, unfortunately, too many cancelled games and maybe a game that should have been cancelled here, Skull & Bones.
5069584	5074030	But let's talk about a classic cancelled game in this next segment.
5074030	5075252	We'll run the bumper right now.
5085894	5093637	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5093637	5097659	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5097659	5104702	All right, DarkSakura, once a month here at Orange Lounge Radio, you actually pick a little twist.
5104702	5107683	You actually do a classic cancelled game.
5107683	5110804	So what is this month's classic cancelled game?
5112819	5117342	I did the classic, the legend, Thrillkill.
5117342	5117823	Oh boy.
5117823	5131011	And how many people have remembered playing various builds of this game and various levels of completion off of some, you know, burned disc, you know?
5131011	5131832	I think I have.
5131832	5139257	Yeah, I mean, I think that most people, I would say.
5139257	5140158	Yeah.
5140158	5141599	So Thrillkill,
5142814	5150138	was a fighting game that was developed by Paradox Development for the PlayStation.
5150138	5168947	It was intended to be released in 1998 and the game's plot is about 10 people who get sent to hell after dying on Earth and are forced by Marutka, the goddess of secrets, to fight to the death, I guess the again death, for a chance at reincarnation.
5170063	5178509	And it was marketed to be the first four-player 3D fighting game because you could play with the multi-tap.
5180959	5191806	And each of the character has a kill meter that as you keep attacking, once it's filled up, you get a gory finisher move called a thrill kill.
5191806	5205756	The game began life as a game called Earth Monster, which was a sport video game that was based off of a Mesoamerican ball game where you are
5206937	5207598	DarkSakura
5223037	5235405	It basically got an AO rating and it was the, you know, first game to receive its rating like that for violence.
5235405	5242409	But at any rate, the Thrill Kill was considered to be very fun.
5242409	5246272	It was in, you know, going back in beta, people really loved it.
5246272	5249314	I think I played an early beta of it.
5250200	5265061	but then EA, it was actually going to be published by Virgin, Virgin Interactive, but then EA got the publishing rights and chose not to release it or sell it to other publishers because it was considered too graphic.
5265908	5270512	Now that said, welcome to the internet.
5270512	5279581	So there were bootleg versions of the game going around on various pirating platforms and ROM releases.
5279581	5286307	And then the game did live on in a
5287870	5290113	a different version of the game.
5290113	5298003	It was released in 1999 as a re-skinned game called Wu-Tang Shaolin Style.
5298003	5302889	It was developed by Paradox and they used Thrill Kill's engine to do it.
5302889	5306073	In fact, they used Thrill Kill's engine in a few other games.
5307394	5320285	So basically, as it goes, you've got four opponents in a closed 3D room who have to fight each other with gory thrill kills and stuff.
5320285	5327571	So you've got four attack buttons, and each one corresponds to an arm and a leg.
5327571	5330694	If you stand still, you auto-block or hold down a guard button.
5332254	5335436	Double tapping in the direction lets you dash.
5335436	5341639	You have throws, including a swap throw, so you can switch places with another character.
5341639	5345440	You have a hold throw where you, you know, do like a lock or something.
5347882	5352125	And you have a high and low counters instead of, you know, your life bar.
5352125	5373041	Like I said, you've got your kill meter and it increases with each successful attack and whoever hits that meter first has to use their thrill kill on another appointment of their choice which then removes them from the round and you're, you know, so basically whoever hits the most and kills the fastest, you know, ends up on top.
5373781	5375003	You've got different modes.
5375003	5383073	You have an arcade mode where you are a single player through 8 stages against computer controlled opponents.
5383073	5389681	The first 6 or 4 player matches and the latter 2 are 1 on 1 where you fight Judas and Maruka.
5392384	5413641	the Versus where you can play with your friends, you can use the PlayStation MultiTap, there's a training mode for a single player to go against a computer opponent to learn the moves, and you can even do... if you perform each of their moves in this mode, you get a 5th costume to the character.
5419644	5432868	Dante's Cage, The Crematorium, Sacrificial Ruins, Chamber of Anguish, The Lavatory, Insane Asylum, Slaughterhouse of the Flesh, Sewer of Sticks, Sinner's Cell, and Homicide Avenue.
5435229	5438831	So your characters, let's let's begin with the characters.
5438831	5448418	So you have Bella Donna, who is a librarian who became a dominatrix and killed her husband and sister after discovering they were having an affair.
5448418	5452520	And she died by electrocuting herself with a cattle prod.
5452520	5453181	My goodness.
5454611	5455191	Yeah.
5455191	5459754	Oh, these character descriptions, these are gold.
5459754	5466497	You have Cain, who is an arsonist who got trapped inside a building he set on fire and was burned alive.
5466497	5471279	And he has very wide reaches and he farts fire.
5471279	5472480	Nice.
5472480	5478042	You have Cletus, the cannibal who sold homestyle sausages made from people.
5478042	5482545	And he died from a tapeworm infection from one of his victims.
5483542	5489727	He fights with a detached leg and can bite his opponents.
5489727	5502236	There's Dr. Faustus, a plastic surgeon who killed and disfigured his patients and died from an infection after affixing a bear trap to his face.
5502236	5505599	And he uses a scalpel and uses the bear trap as a mouth.
5507059	5515301	And then you have The Imp, who is a small person leather daddy who hates tall people.
5515301	5523783	And he died after amputating his legs and instilling stilts instead.
5523783	5527464	But he hasn't killed anybody during his time on Earth, and he uses the stilts as weapons.
5530487	5536389	Yeah, there's Judas, who is the pair of conjoined twins connected at the torso.
5536389	5539410	No one knows how they ended up in hell.
5539410	5543572	So depending on who's on top, one is the upper and one is the lower.
5543572	5551255	And one of their skins, for the record, looks like Ken and Ryu joined at the torso.
5551255	5552295	That's awesome.
5552295	5552676	Yeah.
5555389	5556790	I used to use that one.
5556790	5562235	There was Mammoth who was a postal employee who went postal after getting fired.
5562235	5565137	And he looks like a large skinless gorilla.
5565137	5571262	Maruka, the demon and goddess of secrets who fights and she can teleport.
5571262	5578527	Oddball is a FBI behavioral analyst who became a serial killer and still wears a straitjacket in hell and can't use his arms.
5578527	5582811	So he kicks in headbutts and he breakdances.
5582811	5583792	Like I said, these are gold.
5584522	5594886	Tormentor, a judge named William Whitefield who would acquit criminals in order to kidnap and torture them later and was eventually executed for his crimes.
5594886	5599067	His outfit is bondage related and he uses a heated whip.
5599067	5607230	Violet, a circus contortionist who developed a strong hatred for men after someone broke into her room and abused her.
5609631	5612772	Stop using that as a plot point for women, by the way.
5612772	5614072	Ugh, I'm gonna go.
5614072	5620894	Anyway, she died of a spinal cord rupture, and she fights as a contortionist.
5620894	5630558	There is a 12th non-player character who is called the Gimp, as in the one from Pulp Fiction.
5630558	5631438	He's a training opponent.
5632697	5633658	So, yeah.
5633658	5636320	This game is, I mean, clearly problematic.
5636320	5640163	I mean, to say the minimum.
5640163	5647669	And it, like I said, it got an AO rating, Adults Only rating, for its content.
5647669	5650131	It's very problematic.
5650131	5651492	But it was a fun game.
5651492	5657597	I mean, despite all of the problematic stuff, the game played well.
5657597	5658318	And, you know,
5659253	5670459	The game already even had, it was 99% done and had a sequel planned that was either going to be called S&M or FUBAR.
5670459	5678404	Yeah, for people who don't, who never have known what FUBAR means, it's for fucked up beyond all recognition.
5678404	5682106	Anyway, they were,
5683363	5685304	They had offers to buy it.
5685304	5687406	Eidos wanted it.
5687406	5697773	But EA was trying to get over the industry stigma about being a violent medium and all of that.
5697773	5700054	It was just a big clusterfuck.
5700054	5703537	And this also had to do with
5705327	5714854	I don't think we were supposed to say his name again, but maybe the Statue of Limitations has, you know, let off on that due to, I'll say, relevancy.
5714854	5721799	So it was the Joe Lieberman connections to EA.
5721799	5723641	I don't think it was him.
5723641	5724882	You're thinking of Jack Thompson.
5724882	5725962	I think that lawyer guy.
5725962	5726703	Yeah, I think I am.
5727003	5732985	that I know Lieberman had been a big thing in there, but he was very opposed to video game violence.
5732985	5734946	And then we call them Jack Voldemort for a while.
5734946	5738507	But now we don't say that term either, because that all got tainted.
5738507	5742448	So my goodness, everything that gets attached, call them all the tainted.
5742668	5745430	Yeah, the Tainted, that's what it is.
5745430	5749572	But anyway, there were tons of bootleg copies that made it out.
5749572	5755876	It was considered one of the most popular downloaded ROMs on the Internet, you know, into the late 90s and early 2000s.
5759598	5766503	Remember Hyde earlier said that the Thrill Kill engine was used in other games by Paradox?
5766503	5778270	It was also used for X-Men Mutant Academy in 2000 and its sequel in 2001, X-Men Mutant Academy 2, and then Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena in 2000.
5782330	5793756	One reviewer described this game as perfect for mindless fun with friends and cold drinks.
5793756	5795617	Mindless but not brainless.
5799439	5808967	There should be enough depth to this gameplay to satisfy the hardcore 3D fighting fans once Paradox has completed its final few months of dedicated beta tweaking.
5817173	5826896	I mean, GamePro put it on the list of 50 best fighting game characters ever in 2011 for, uh, you know, for some of the characters there.
5826896	5833018	I mean, it was, it's, it's a classic.
5833018	5840400	I mean, and as far as I'm considered, because it was just so available, I, I,
5843652	5848154	It was hard for me to even remember that this actually had been a cancelled game.
5848154	5849775	Because it was just everywhere.
5849775	5858799	I mean, you can buy, quote, commercial copies, like the 99% finished ones, with people having filled in the gaps and everything.
5858799	5862641	So, I mean, yeah, that's it.
5862641	5863202	It's Thrill Kill.
5864062	5872606	It is very interesting that, you know, this is a very good story of once it's on the internet, there's no stopping it, right?
5872606	5876727	Like a lot of fan projects to get cancelled by Nintendo and that sort of thing, right?
5876727	5882029	We learned that, you know, you don't announce those sort of things and tell the ROMs on the internet because at that point, well, there's no stopping it.
5882029	5883190	It's everywhere now.
5883190	5886311	This is a very interesting early example of that, right?
5886311	5888512	So, but to... Yeah, something like that.
5888852	5890794	I actually knew very little about this game.
5890794	5894139	I knew of it because I think you've brought it up on the show before.
5894139	5897062	But I brought it over to your house to your apartment.
5897062	5898884	I literally never remember playing this.
5898884	5899325	I know.
5899325	5900446	I don't doubt that that's true.
5900446	5904331	But it's just one of those like, I don't remember it.
5904331	5907475	But now now that I'm seeing it again, I'm like, wow, it looks like garbage.
5909176	5910838	The PS1 was not 100% polished.
5927600	5931443	But it was it played really solidly.
5931443	5940930	Like I could see why they would want to have reused that engine for other games because it was it was a solid engine to boot.
5940930	5941470	Yeah.
5941470	5947334	You know, we had a lot of fun playing playing the game, you know, and just going, Oh, look at that.
5947334	5950196	You know, being like five year olds pointing at the naughty bits.
5950196	5950837	Mm hmm.
5951537	5952299	TeeHee Bloods
5966650	5972814	All right, well, there it is your classic canceled game of the month and we will look forward to next month's canceled game.
5972814	5976096	All right, unless, you know, the segment gets canceled.
5976096	5976576	No, it won't.
5976576	5977957	We'll be back next month with that.
5977957	5986483	Okay, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news and some other quick headlines before we get to the listener roundtable here.
5986483	5988144	So we'll start with Loki with a few quick headlines.
5989020	5994024	Sony is saying that the PlayStation 5 is entering the latter half of its life cycle.
5994024	5998267	I mean, yes, it's been out for a while, so that makes sense.
5998267	6003411	It doesn't feel like it, but only because I waited so long to buy one, because remember, you can't keep a party fine for forever, yeah.
6003991	6005532	That's true.
6005532	6023743	Regarding the PlayStation 5 hardware, which enters its fifth year since launch, partially due to it entering the latter half of the console cycle, we aim to optimize sales with a greater emphasis on balance with profits, so we anticipate a gradual decline in unit sales from the next fiscal year onwards.
6023743	6030187	They may be selling less units, but they still want to be profitable, I guess, is what that means.
6030187	6032229	And then, news that's important to me,
6033317	6033477	Ale
6061885	6075332	Arcade1up had a leak that for the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet that they have X-Men 97 deluxe arcade art.
6075332	6079334	So that's going to be pretty neat.
6079334	6084277	I'm looking at the image that was leaked for it.
6085848	6088511	And yeah, it's like got all of those outfits.
6088511	6095258	It's got, you know, the the Jim Lee era costumes and whatnot.
6095258	6097280	So.
6097280	6098601	Cool.
6098601	6103727	But I'm sure they're kind of kicking themselves about the leak, but I mean, it's artwork.
6103727	6104267	It's pretty good.
6104267	6104788	It's pretty neat.
6105290	6110856	A lot of people very excited about that X-Men 97 cartoon.
6110856	6112538	Even I'd watch that, to be honest.
6112538	6114720	I remember watching the old cartoon.
6114720	6116082	I think it's good times.
6117404	6125748	Alright, well, in Evercade news, which is a thing we're reporting on now, now that I guess I have a vested interest in this, but no, this does sound cool.
6125748	6132051	We actually have news of another cartridge that's going to be coming out for the Evercade that is coming out very soon.
6132051	6144837	It is the Sunsoft Collection 2, which will have Euphoria the Saga, Blaster Master, Enemy Below, that's the Game Boy one, Arrow the Acrobat 2, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, Days Before Christmas,
6145517	6149140	Galaxy Fight, Universal Warriors, and Pre-Pre-Primitive Princess
6167024	6168705	That might be fun to play.
6168705	6170466	I do want to get one of those.
6170466	6172327	I was actually looking at two they have.
6172327	6175830	So there is.
6175830	6177511	Oh, God, they have one.
6177511	6182754	It's not the Evercade, but it's it's similar to that.
6182754	6185336	And it also plays Evercade cartridges.
6185336	6187017	I think it was.
6187017	6189939	It's like it looks like a Game Boy almost.
6189939	6192161	I don't know if Evercade's super popular.
6192461	6194663	Pocket is what it's called.
6194663	6195363	That's the thing.
6195363	6197785	They have a like a desktop and a portable.
6197785	6199066	They have two different systems.
6199066	6199326	Right.
6199326	6205171	But this they have the portal one that's kind of more of the form factor of like a PSP or something like that.
6205171	6209714	And this is more of a form factor of like a Game Boy type of thing.
6209714	6214097	Oh, it's it's the Super Pocket is what it's called.
6214097	6215338	It looks cool.
6215338	6215899	Yeah.
6215899	6218541	I want to get some.
6218541	6218921	All right.
6220240	6228497	Well, I think we have now a chance to travel the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming out in a game store near you.
6228497	6230522	So let's start with the US Loki.
6231802	6244091	Let's see, so in the US we have The Lost Legends of Redwall, The Scout Anthology on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6244091	6246193	Irem Collection Vol.
6246193	6250976	2 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6252458	6260845	Nightingale, BandleTale, League of Legends, LastEpoch, SlaveZeroX, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series

6305499	6319307	And then we've got Yohani, the Parhelion, Namazu in the Mirage, and that's on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5.
6319307	6328473	And last but not least for the week, we have Promenade on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6328473	6328753	That's it.
6329705	6332507	Shin Chan, Shiro of Coal Town, Yohane the Parhyllian, Premium Box Limited Edition
6349617	6350918	School Girl Dating Sim, Seifuku Kanojo
6367307	6370149	Schoolgirl, it's called Schoolgirl.
6370149	6372010	That's what it is.
6372010	6377172	Lunaria, Virtualized Moonchild comes out in regular and limited edition as well.
6377172	6379714	Retro Game Challenge 1 plus 2 replay.
6379714	6381875	I think that's the one Loki was starting to read.
6381875	6386117	That is, I think that's the one based off the show, the CX.
6386117	6387078	Yeah, it's that one.
6387078	6388539	So that's coming out of Japan as well.
6388539	6390840	It looks like it has its own little cute little mini games.
6390840	6394522	I don't know if there are things that were like popularized for the show or what, but it looks cute.
6394522	6395122	So check that out.
6398067	6402370	Retro Game Challenge that is out on this 22nd with everything else on the Switch.
6402370	6414359	We also have Five Fun Go Nii Gai na Ketsumatsu Monochrome no Toshikan comes out as well from D3.
6414359	6417741	And that is it for Japanese releases on the Switch.
6417741	6419262	But let me check the PlayStation 5.
6419262	6421644	I'm gonna guess we're gonna get some overlap there.
6421644	6426007	And yeah, Yohane the Parhelion comes out as well on the PS5.
6427188	6427568	DarkSakura
6451348	6454130	A handful, I'm going to go through the end of the month.
6454130	6460294	We have Operation Serpents for PlayStation for February 23rd.
6460294	6464817	For PlayStation and Switch we have Broforce.
6464817	6471041	On the 27th for PlayStation and Xbox we have Warhammer Age of Sigmar Realms of Ruin.
6473062	6482087	On the 29th we have Welcome to Paradise with a Z for Xbox and PlayStation and then for PlayStation we have Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
6485868	6489672	Well, we will get to our listener roundtable in just a moment.
6489672	6491534	But unfortunately, we do have one more headline.
6491534	6495478	I say unfortunately, because this is a little bit of shocking and sad news.
6495478	6497680	Loki with our final headline tonight.
6497680	6503606	Yes, unfortunately, Yoshitaka Murayama has passed away.
6503606	6506689	And he was best known for, of course,
6510072	6515136	Suikoden, and of course Iodine Chronicles 100 Heroes was the newest game.
6515136	6518618	It was kind of a spiritual successor that he had put together.
6518618	6525082	He passed away at age of 55 from complications due to his illness.
6525082	6528244	And they didn't really disclose much more about what the illness is.
6528244	6530586	Yeah, they're trying to keep it pretty private, it sounds like.
6530586	6530726	Yeah.
6531687	6532787	That's still bad.
6532787	6535108	Yeah, very young, very sad.
6535108	6541809	And, you know, also when you consider that Aiden Chronicles is coming out in like just a couple of months, I think it's an April release, if I remember right.
6541809	6549151	So it's really tragic that he didn't get a chance to see how the game ultimately ends up being received, which hopefully is pretty good.
6549151	6551212	You know, we won't know until we ultimately get our hands on it.
6551212	6560814	But you know, or just the mere fact of getting to see Suikoden, you know, amongst all the Konami fuckery, get a second life of sorts.
6561614	6564876	Um, with this, you know, spiritual successor, it's, it's, it's a bummer.
6564876	6565876	He didn't get to see that.
6565876	6567937	So this makes this news very, very sad.
6567937	6569918	And I see a lot of you in chat kind of echoing that.
6569918	6574020	Bonds006 says, I saw the news of his passing earlier today on socials.
6574020	6575181	Yeah, it's been making the rounds.
6575181	6575961	He actually passed.
6575961	6582544	I want to say he passed on February 6th, but they withheld the news for about a week, probably because of like the privacy and all that stuff.
6582544	6586506	So, um, yeah, just still very shocking, very shocking and sad.
6587742	6589803	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

6638553	6645755	If you'd like to call in tonight, visit our discord over at VOGNetwork.com slash discord and head over to our green room.
6645755	6651276	But I do believe we have at least one email tonight, so I'm going to throw it over to DarkSakura.
6651276	6655937	We do indeed have the just one.
6655937	6656597	We have
6658230	6666954	Hello LR!
6666954	6671656	I couldn't help but comment on reactions last week to the news that new plastic instruments are coming.
6671656	6674658	I believe the reactions included Goodwill, Ozone, Landfill, and OK.
6676156	6686938	Way, way back in 2015, when Rock Band 4 and Guitar Hero Live both launched, I believe they both arrived at least two to three years too early, and they needed to have waited longer to generate adequate demand.
6686938	6688298	Today, I still believe that.
6688298	6702601	We know today that sales of both titles did not meet expectations, but despite that, even now, there are still many devoted fans who continue to enjoy the Rock Band series of games, including many who enjoyed the series back in its heyday, but have not actually played Rock Band 4 yet.
6704144	6708632	I was one of the folks that was thinking about trying Rock Band 4 on Xbox during the pandemic.
6708632	6713220	I managed to get the software cheap, $10 for the disc, and of course I already had a USB microphone.
6713220	6716085	Next I needed the guitar, and here's where the problem begins.
6719275	6726678	Personally, I have a wireless guitar hero controller as well as a wired rock band 1 guitar, both for Xbox 360.
6726678	6729839	Of course, none of those work on modern Xbox consoles out of the gate.
6729839	6731180	Good thing they made adapters.
6731180	6733120	Okay, what do those adapters cost in 2024?
6735641	6744564	The adapter that allows you to use wireless Xbox 360 peripherals and RockBand 4 is currently going between $250 and $300 by itself in used condition.
6744564	6746985	The wired adapter can go up to $400.
6746985	6750607	Forget it, you might say, I'll just get the RockBand 4 guitar controllers.
6750607	6755348	Well, those are starting around $200 used, and you want drums, that'll be at least $250 to $300 used, of course.
6757526	6773048	It's true that music games through the last 20 plus years have often required people spending some serious money on controllers and accessories, especially the niche Japanese titles, but to even be able to play Rock Band 4 at all now is prohibitively expensive for most people.
6773869	6779392	And now in 2024, PDP has announced the production of new Rock Band 4 guitar controllers.
6779392	6785456	Joke if you like, but this means that a number of folks, myself included, will not actually be able to play the game.
6785456	6793000	Even if these new PDP guitars wind up costing over $100, that is still affordable to some folks when compared to some options right now.
6793000	6797843	Not to mention these controllers will be brand new and hopefully will have decent build quality.
6797843	6800905	So yeah, as ridiculous as this may seem, it actually is important to some
6801525	6804449	Folks, anyways, thanks as always for the show.
6804449	6806832	Let's march toward a thousand to continue.
6806832	6808555	Rock on OLR, Erin YYR.
6809585	6815149	Yeah, like, I understand how maybe our somewhat dismissive comments may have rubbed you the wrong way.
6815149	6821214	And I get it because I know you're a music and music game fan at heart, you know, and we were big music game fans too.
6821214	6823815	But yeah, at the end of the day, here's what it is with peripherals.
6823815	6830200	And why, you know, at least my comment was, you know, I think I'd said landfill or so I don't one of those words was mine.
6830200	6832142	But I think it was the end.
6832842	6850251	maybe yeah but but and here's why because in reality when those games were first out those controllers and things were everywhere and people were having rock band parties and you know it was all that good fun and stuff but then it's just kind of like that all kind of disappeared
6850851	6858493	And maybe not for you, but I'm talking about like on a large scale, you know, it's mass popularity kind of disappeared.
6858493	6861174	And now those plastic instruments really feel like they're piling up.
6861174	6868797	I bet a lot of people don't even know that they might be sitting on a gold mine in their garage or in their basement of how much those controllers are worth at this time.
6869437	6878107	But the reality is, I feel like, and I kind of hinted at this earlier in the show when I was talking about keyboards, I feel like if I were to pick one up, I would play it twice, I would be like, okay, that was cool.
6878107	6879269	And then it's done.
6879269	6885196	Because I think it would be a lot harder to find like a group of people who want to come together and do this thing in one place.
6885196	6889461	Because, and this is the other very important part, that's not what Fortnite Festival is.
6890535	6895258	As far as I know, and I could be wrong, you can't play Fortnite Festival on one screen all in the same room.
6895258	6900562	It's meant to be played with people across the internet in different places.
6900562	6905465	So by that nature, it's kind of like, well, they don't really see you with the controller.
6905465	6910569	So I feel like a lot of it kind of loses its charm with Fortnite Festival.
6910569	6911610	I understand that, you know,
6912130	6918772	people have very rich rock band libraries and this will allow people to tap into that still and so forth.
6918772	6925234	I do understand all that but I just kind of wonder for the for most gamers.
6925234	6927455	How long?
6927455	6928155	How?
6928155	6930495	Oh, the rain is really starting to come down outside.
6930495	6931956	How long does that really last?
6933223	6934063	That's all.
6934063	6935824	But I'm glad you know what, I'm glad for you.
6935824	6941927	And you know, there are a lot of music game fans that really appreciate it and would use it on a regular basis.
6941927	6943647	And for that reason, it's cool.
6943647	6950410	But I just I say landfill because for the most part, I think most of those plastic instruments, people don't know the value of them.
6950410	6953151	And that's where they ended up.
6953151	6956152	So, yeah.
6956152	6957413	But I appreciate the perspective.
6957413	6959614	Every gamer has a voice.
6959614	6959854	All right.
6960765	6969370	Well, if you want to send us an email in a future week, perhaps you have a differing opinion than we do that say, okay, participate at orange laundry.com as long as you're civil and respectful about it.
6969370	6973193	We will hear those differing opinions for sure.
6973193	6974373	All right.
6974373	6977335	That is definitely some red cell rain coming down outside right now.
6977335	6978116	It sounds like the shower.
6978996	6980037	That turned on outside.
6980037	6980257	Woo.
6980257	6982118	Has it hit your place?
6982118	6984899	Loki, I know you're a little Eastie here, so it probably hasn't hit you yet.
6984899	6986700	DarkSakura, has it hit your place yet?
6986700	6987300	It's pretty loud.
6987300	6988240	I haven't noticed.
6988240	6990301	I have noise canceling headphones on.
6990301	6991082	Oh, that's probably why.
6991983	6994484	I can't tell because someone's showering right now too.
6994484	6995984	So it just sounds like water anyways.
6995984	6998225	Yeah, it wouldn't it takes you're a little east of me.
6998225	6999385	So probably take some time to get over there.
6999385	7000166	But anyway.
7000166	7001426	All right.
7001426	7003967	Uh, yeah, I know smash the save button when the show ends for sure.
7003967	7004287	For sure.
7004287	7009268	Well, luckily we are getting toward maybe unluckily, luckily we're getting towards the end of the show anyway.
7009268	7011409	So we're gonna wrap things up here.
7011409	7014510	I did want to call out and ask real quick, though, if Loki had any last minute stories.
7015055	7022317	I do have one fun thing, and it is a fan-made remake of Zelda 2.
7022317	7027258	They enhanced it with an enhanced second quest to it as well.
7027258	7028878	We've been watching it today, actually.
7028878	7030599	Did this come out?
7030599	7039421	Yeah, it's available, it's on, so if you go to hoverbat.itch.io slash Z-I-I A-O-L
7040454	7041655	Zelda 2 Adventures of Link
7070387	7071187	Thanks for watching!
7092233	7102099	Some of the other things that they've changed too as well, they've added, yeah, the creator added new areas, new puzzles, as well as introducing heart and magic containers throughout the world.
7102099	7108703	They've also added one-ups that increase your permanent stock of lives even after you have to continue.
7108703	7111185	And there's better checkpoints as well.
7111185	7112806	So, that's nice.
7114744	7120168	Oh, and some of the magic has changed names.
7120168	7123029	So, I mean, I think it's very well done.
7123029	7123930	It's absolutely worth it.
7123930	7128013	I mean, it's still not my favorite game, so I'm not gonna play it.
7128013	7133176	I've never liked the style for Zelda 2, but if you are a fan of it, absolutely go get it.
7133786	7137128	Yeah, I liked it when I was younger, but it's it's aged.
7137128	7140931	Interestingly, I don't know how else to put it.
7140931	7141731	All right.
7141731	7143973	Well, with that, we're about towards the end of the show.
7143973	7148936	So this is a chance for us to wrap it all up and say, we're going to see you in two weeks.
7148936	7151698	Reminder, we will not be here next week, but we will be back in two weeks.
7151698	7156541	But stay tuned to our personal streams and our personal feeds, because it sounds like we might be cooking something up.
7156541	7161645	It sounds like Loki might have something on Saturday and the Dark Sakura could be doing something over here on Sunday.
7161645	7163726	But stay tuned to the local feed.
7163826	7166847	Thanks for checking out our show!
7185055	7187137	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7198494	7204917	I've had some issues with the weather as well, with being able to stay online.
7204917	7213580	Like, it's been affecting the GeForce thing weird, and honestly, I need to take some me time to take care of some stuff tonight.
7213580	7214020	Fair enough.
7214020	7222043	So, as a result, I'm not going to stream, but I do have a deserving target in mind.
7222043	7223504	Cool.
7223504	7226125	Alright, well, do you have a final thought for us tonight before we wrap up?
7228700	7231143	Fact check all the things.
7231143	7233465	Don't believe what you read on the Internet.
7233465	7238171	Fact check all the fucking things.
7238171	7239412	Loki, with that, I'll go to you.
7239412	7241514	Your final thought tonight.
7241514	7247221	I'm just hopefully going to be working hard on getting more content out for my YouTube show.
7249271	7259238	Um, and for me, I just, I'm, I'm looking forward to as what Enya sung in a particular song of hers, sail away, sail away, sail away.
7259238	7260659	That's all I want to do right now.
7260659	7262560	So I will see everybody in two weeks.
7262560	7263921	I'm looking forward to it.
7263921	7266483	I hope you all have some happy gaming and some happy times.
