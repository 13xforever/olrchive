00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:17,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox president Sarah Bond has stated that Microsoft is working on the next-gen Xbox, which will be the largest technical leap you've ever seen in a hardware generation.

2
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:26,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe making up for the fact that the leap from the last generation to this one was not so incredible, despite consoles being larger than they ever have been, and if PC video cards are any indication, they're not getting any smaller.

3
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside this cynic is a disappointed idealist.

4
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:36,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you about this, the Xbox podcast, and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:24,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_06]: You want a preview?

16
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:26,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]: Like legit a new intro.

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:28,549
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,170
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready?

20
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:36,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate you.

22
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:38,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Delete it.

23
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:39,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Show's over.

24
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's the thing.

25
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:44,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having some microphone issues as we're doing live tonight.

26
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,009
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not microphone issues.

27
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,870
[SPEAKER_00]: It's setting issues and configurations that got reset and everything.

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually the third take of the show's intro, but darn it.

29
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:54,513
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to get it right this time.

30
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, exactly.

31
00:01:57,074 --> 00:02:00,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, we got my soundboard came in handy.

32
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:01,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:02,758
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

34
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:04,080
[SPEAKER_00]: But how's your week going?

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, DarkSakura, besides all the constant retakes tonight?

36
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, it's been okay.

37
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's it's been a medical week.

38
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

39
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think so.

40
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,173
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, I mean, that's a good good medical stuff, hopefully.

41
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, in the I'll just go ahead and put it out here.

42
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I had part of my toenail permanently removed.

43
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.

44
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:34,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a cortisone shot in my hip.

45
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:35,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a blood draw.

46
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:41,081
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so you're you're getting your so like I'm like the human pin cushion today.

47
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:44,144
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting your punch card stamped for ten ten visits.

48
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Get one free at the doctor's office type of thing, right?

49
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:56,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I got at least two things done in one day so that was fine.

50
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:59,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention when I got the jab in my toe.

51
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:04,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing hurts worse than getting the lidocaine in your toe.

52
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:06,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Or whatever they want to give you.

53
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will tell you this.

54
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I found that it hurts worse when I can't see it happen.

55
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:13,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Reaction

56
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:36,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, when I get my blood drawn, I walk in there and I say, go ahead and take it from right here and put it on the arm.

57
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be looking out the window.

58
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:38,583
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.

59
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't like to watch.

60
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:42,345
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have my system down.

61
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:44,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Then do this instead.

62
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:52,408
[SPEAKER_06]: When you feel the first, breathe in then, and then just let it out slowly and it will still force you to relax.

63
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:53,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll make it hurt less.

64
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel like I kind of instinctively do that a little bit.

65
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe.

66
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:57,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

67
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I do want to anyway, I sort of mentioned Medical Lounge Radio.

68
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I want to mention our chat room, though.

69
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:04,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Reekin Elite is there.

70
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:05,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

71
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:08,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, saying OMG, you okay?

72
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,034
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're talking to me.

73
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:10,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm fine.

74
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:11,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

75
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:11,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

76
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:17,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, a lot of stuff that I do when when I go in for stuff like this is preventative.

77
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:17,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

78
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:29,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather, like for example I get like mild ingrown toenails and since I'm doing ballet I know they'll get worse so I just had them do it

79
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:31,006
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

80
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:55,717
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

81
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:34,238
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think the normal age like 73, 74 and my dad's like 10 years above that so he finally had to have one of his eyes done this week and so I had to take him not just to the surgery but then the next day take him to the follow-up appointment so I just I had to basically play uber this week which is fine because it sounds like my dad like he's like yeah I can actually see better because right now now he has one eye without and one eye with because he has the other eye now scheduled to be done in April

82
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has one eye without, one eye with.

83
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,060
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, I can see the difference.

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,821
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of trippy.

85
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:41,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, one of them's got different color hues than the other.

86
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:45,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of living with that for a little bit until they do the other eye.

87
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, kind of interesting.

88
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:52,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Once my right toe is healed up, then I'm going to get the left one done.

89
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I might wait and do it after my birthday trip to Disneyland.

90
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:58,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we'll see.

91
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:01,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I mean, you know, uh,

92
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:19,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma was saying that he gets a blood draw every three months and I get a full blood panel twice a year for my post-bariatric surgery panel and they also take a few extras like parathyroid and thyroid because I'm on thyroid medication.

93
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So I watch the whole thing.

94
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:28,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And every so often, I'll take a picture of the vials and then go get color matched for hair dye.

95
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,931
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

96
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?

97
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?

98
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:33,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I promise it's a video game show.

99
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,034
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes we catch up on our personal lives too.

100
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,035
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our little little chat show every week.

101
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when I had that big bump on the back of my neck?

102
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:40,583
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember?

103
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

104
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:42,365
[SPEAKER_06]: The lipoma?

105
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:44,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most of that was during the pandemic, I think.

106
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how if you ever saw it, like when it got like really big or whatever.

107
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,270
[SPEAKER_00]: But they finally cut that out a few years ago, right?

108
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have it anymore.

109
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And because because it was starting to hurt.

110
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:54,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute I said, I think it hurts.

111
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:56,354
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, Nope, we're taking it out.

112
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:57,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making sure it's not anything bad.

113
00:06:57,695 --> 00:06:58,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Good news isn't anything bad.

114
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:03,779
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first thing once they took that out, which they did not put me under for, which okay, fine.

115
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,380
[SPEAKER_00]: It's local anesthetic.

116
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:04,760
[SPEAKER_00]: That's normal.

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but when they took it out, the first thing they were like, do you want to see it?

118
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:11,322
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, absolutely the fuck not.

119
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:12,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to see that?

120
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it in the garbage.

121
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:15,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did.

122
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:16,905
[SPEAKER_06]: My pomas aren't gross.

123
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It literally is just fat.

124
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,606
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole, that whole experience.

125
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:24,367
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and this is people take to the medical stuff differently.

126
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:32,751
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that whole thing, like I was in shock for like four hours after that whole thing happened, because I should not have been awake for it.

127
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly,

128
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:38,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Lipoma, unless it's like within the muscle or something.

129
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:43,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely like common procedure to be awake during lipoma removal.

130
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:45,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it is, but I still should have been.

131
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:49,661
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm saying, because I was not a great experience.

132
00:07:49,661 --> 00:08:00,388
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I actually had to be able to recognize lipoma and cysts and cancers and things as a massage therapist.

133
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:00,949
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will.

134
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you is like I told I told her flat out when I get the other toe done.

135
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:06,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to watch it.

136
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, I've been awake for a couple of different surgeries.

137
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:19,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they said that I talked people's ear off and they that's why they had it to sedate me during the second of one of my surgeries because I want to know everything that's going on.

138
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to watch.

139
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,327
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, we need to check in with of course, our other hosts.

140
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

141
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:26,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

142
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what fun medical procedures have you had done this week?

143
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,591
[SPEAKER_00]: You or your family members?

144
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:33,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any good trips to the doctor stories?

145
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye surgeries?

146
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:35,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Upcoming?

147
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:36,797
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

148
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:37,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're boring.

149
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:37,898
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

150
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:38,478
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.

151
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,099
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

152
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:40,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how are you doing?

153
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a good week too, Loki?

154
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:43,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

155
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, well, not in grade school.

156
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:02,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that, you know, I can't complain because you know, everybody has Monday off.

157
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:06,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly I have so much because I was out for, you know, a good few hours.

158
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:12,539
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was like, I have to check in for a couple hours tomorrow just to get caught up because then I work Tuesday.

159
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:13,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's it.

160
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off for like 10 days because it's nice.

161
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the cruise and everything and having to travel out to Orlando and everything.

162
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:24,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's Yeah, it's gonna be a nice break.

163
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:24,583
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah,

164
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:25,868
[SPEAKER_00]: and

165
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,352
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that are kind of there this week that hopefully everything's okay.

166
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:58,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope it's not like a bumpy road or anything because I'm like, dang, there's like a lot of people that all of a sudden are taking vacation at the end of February.

167
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:11,289
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like it's a lot of people that had just delayed stuff for various reasons, whether it was, you know, COVID or just other types of, you know, obligations and things that just kind of popped up that like everybody's gone at the same time.

168
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is interesting.

169
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of noticed some of that, too.

170
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:20,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I'll tell you what's what's weird is that my schedule has been going back and forth.

171
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:34,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, I'm just like, pick one, because I went back on my four by ten this past week and I realized that I don't think I can do my four by tens like like I was with the nature of what I do at work.

172
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:38,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm back on the five bytes Monday through Friday.

173
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:38,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

174
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm OK with it.

175
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:40,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

176
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:40,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

177
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:47,367
[SPEAKER_00]: SSJ100 Matt says, whatever you do, don't sign on to Slack, not even to see it burning.

178
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:48,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the break.

179
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:49,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't use Slack.

180
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,030
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a different application.

181
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,672
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially the same thing.

182
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:57,737
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am lucky enough that I have a work and a personal so and my work... What's going on with Slack?

183
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,478
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use it.

184
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:00,039
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

185
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... I mean, but why did he mention Slack?

186
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there something going on with Slack?

187
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:10,327
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, it's like if you're awake, I think the point is if you're away on vacation, don't look at everything that's burning while you're away on vacation.

188
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,609
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, I literally can't.

189
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:16,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally can't take my work phone even if I wanted to because this trip is going out of the country.

190
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's we're not supposed to do that.

191
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,836
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Yeah, so sorry, no work phone for me.

192
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:23,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, darn.

193
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to enjoy the time off.

194
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:25,018
[SPEAKER_00]: So

195
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,639
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll be fine.

196
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's gonna be fine.

197
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,300
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything always has a way to work out.

198
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing to remember is that, you know, everything works out.

199
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:33,042
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.

200
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have a good break.

201
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:41,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, um, let's see, uh, as Chase Winermath says, I just assumed he was using Slack because most of my friends use Slack.

202
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:43,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Blackwell says, I mute notifications in Slack.

203
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, a lot of you use Slack.

204
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:48,649
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S says, if I hear Slack go off multiple times in 30 seconds, then I'll answer it.

205
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,750
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the weird thing is, I've only ever used Slack because of video games.

206
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:59,517
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Ingress planning has always happened on Slack, especially live events and things like that.

207
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:10,488
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big Pokemon Go event going on this weekend in LA actually, which if I wasn't going on the cruise, I probably would have tried to go to LA this weekend to do that with some friends because it's relatively close.

208
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:12,670
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, didn't end up doing that.

209
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:20,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'll have to ask my friend how that went because one of my good friends did go down to that so maybe I can get him to do a report next week.

210
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:25,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear the first day was kind of rough, but he was doing the Sunday so maybe it was a little easier for him.

211
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:25,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

212
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:30,918
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, let's get into the news of the week and talk about what is going on in video games.

213
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:37,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as I've hinted at a million times during the show, we will not be here next week because of the cruise I was just talking about.

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be back in two weeks to do it all again.

215
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:41,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So um,

216
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,444
[SPEAKER_06]: in the meantime, someone will take requests for gaming.

217
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:46,705
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

218
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby will be here, by the way, especially too.

219
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:52,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should encourage everybody to still tune in to VOG Network live next week.

220
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Blackwolf will be here, but obviously we will not.

221
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's a weird week to not be here.

222
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:06,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm especially after the power outage of last, you know, a couple weeks ago and all that other stuff, which, by the way, we have another big storm coming in tonight.

223
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:06,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.

224
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so nice earlier too.

225
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the worst of that rain is supposed to be till like 11 o'clock.

226
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,126
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be we'll be off the air by that point.

227
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,107
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.

228
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:19,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, um, that means I'm gonna actually sleep like a baby tonight.

229
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: That's gonna be last night.

230
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:21,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I slept really well too.

231
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:29,382
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I was I sleep so incredibly well when there's a hard rain that I have an awful time trying to wake up the next day.

232
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:30,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

233
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:30,543
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

234
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into the news.

235
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:47,169
[SPEAKER_00]: and more!

236
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much.

237
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,493
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a nothing burger.

238
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,895
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a nothing burger is what this could be.

239
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:15,878
[SPEAKER_00]: But Loki, let's it's I don't know if I would call it a nothing burger.

240
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:16,658
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.

241
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,739
[SPEAKER_00]: This was definitely like nothing.

242
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:28,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Like have you ever ordered your hamburger completely plain with nothing on it and no fixings and it's just a plain ass dry hamburger.

243
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:28,706
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is.

244
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,691
[SPEAKER_00]: But Loki, let's let's get into it.

245
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:37,599
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened with the big Xbox podcast and the future?

246
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,981
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the future of Xbox?

247
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So the future of Xbox is podcasts.

248
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:48,695
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be doing lots of them to talk about the future of Xbox, and it's a very nice format.

249
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:53,797
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they discussed a few things regarding of what's going to be coming up.

250
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:59,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did confirm that, yes, there are games planned to be put out multi-platform.

251
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:04,841
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they are not going to be Starfield or Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

252
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:05,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be

253
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:08,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

254
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, PlayStation fans.

255
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be getting Redfall.

256
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:14,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to be all Redfall four times, actually.

257
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:15,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Not getting Redfall.

258
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,238
[SPEAKER_00]: They already know what the games are like.

259
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:19,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they do.

260
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,080
[SPEAKER_04]: They know what the games are.

261
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,162
[SPEAKER_04]: They're waiting for those.

262
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:29,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically said that they didn't want to take away from those teams making those announcements themselves.

263
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:32,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're waiting on those development teams to make those announcements.

264
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So those will probably come later on the year, honestly, like

265
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a big deal until we find out what it is, like if it's Halo coming to PlayStation 5.

266
00:15:42,352 --> 00:16:06,554
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I mean like I I don't I don't know I think like we might tell you right now I'm gonna tell you right now the four games are Grounded, Pentament, Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves those are the four games like it's yeah I mean Xbox hasn't confirmed that Microsoft hasn't confirmed that but it's one of those things where all of the others that we already knew about Hi-Fi Rush we were reporting on that four weeks ago

267
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:31,945
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the signs are pointing that way and especially when you consider that Microsoft has laid off a lot of people and some of them are going to start squeaking even though they're doing it in a way they're not going to get caught because they still have an NDA for their severance and all that stuff like it's it's all but certain these are the four games and when you look at the four games it's four games that make a lot of sense to go multi-platform that's why I think we're sitting here going this is this is a plain burger this is barely anything this is not

268
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:32,365
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.

269
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:56,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Elder Scrolls

270
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:12,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Setsuna

271
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:45,170
[SPEAKER_04]: or... Oh, I don't even remember what the game was.

272
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:51,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But they had like a major AA game that now is kind of a AAA game that's getting a sequel.

273
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:56,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't remember the name of it because I don't... Who does?

274
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft does.

275
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:02,222
[SPEAKER_04]: They have... They came out with one and now they've been teasing it for like... Hellblade?

276
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:03,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Hellblade.

277
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:04,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

278
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:04,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

279
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:04,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Hellblade.

280
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:05,422
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking.

281
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:05,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

282
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Hellblade.

283
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:09,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So Hellblade was more of like a double A game when it first came out.

284
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:19,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's kind of, you know, still being treated like that, but it's kind of elevating itself to a triple A game just because of quality and everything.

285
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:22,412
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still relatively small studio putting that out.

286
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:27,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could even argue that like a No Man's Sky is almost like a double A game.

287
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a triple A game in a sense.

288
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:38,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we should probably stop referring to games with A's because it's just stupid anyways and that's really only marketing speak for, you know, publishers and who cares.

289
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:58,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with that, though, they did announce that coming to Game Pass, one of the first Activision Blizzard games, aside from I think Call of Duty's been on there before, but Diablo 4 is going to be one of the first from this merger that's going to be coming to Game Pass, and that's going to be arriving at the end of March on the 28th.

290
00:18:58,038 --> 00:18:59,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty exciting.

291
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would be surprised by that news, but I'm not.

292
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know why I'm not surprised?

293
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's because they haven't what's not coming to Game Pass, at least not yet.

294
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:10,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we haven't heard the expansion.

295
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:15,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want people to tap into Diablo so they can sell more copies of that expansion.

296
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:25,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming, I don't know, I feel like when I read the transcript, because I didn't, I actually didn't watch the part, again, I was way too busy with what I was doing during the day.

297
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't watch it live.

298
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:28,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the transcript after the fact.

299
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:33,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say in the transcript, he calls out the Diablo expansion as one of those big games.

300
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he kind of says something about like they're all game pass or whatever.

301
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So the waters were a little muddy on that.

302
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:42,707
[SPEAKER_00]: But my assumption is that expansion will not be game pass day one.

303
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:43,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to be wrong.

304
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume that's the case.

305
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe later on down the line when there's like a Diablo game of the year edition or something, they'll do that.

306
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:53,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it is included with Game Pass, Diablo still makes plenty of money.

307
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, they have a battle pass in Diablo now.

308
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,598
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling $30 portal colors and all these other things in the games.

309
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:06,622
[SPEAKER_00]: They have other ways to make money with Diablo besides just, you know, the sale of the actual game.

310
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:17,027
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was surprised at first and I was like, actually, you know what, this far out from the game's release now, of course, they're gonna try to just make money off that in other ways.

311
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:19,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

312
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:30,260
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other things that you talked about too was the fact that one of the catalysts for going multi-platform is, you know, having with all the layoffs they've had to do.

313
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically saying that, you know, this way they're going to help, you know, be able to, I guess, retain more people.

314
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:39,668
[SPEAKER_04]: If you believe that, I don't know.

315
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully that's true.

316
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:42,651
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

317
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:48,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you have more devs working on porting games to other platforms, I could see that as a positive.

318
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:52,800
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see what that actually ends up looking like.

319
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they've committed to new hardware coming.

320
00:20:55,382 --> 00:21:02,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And that it's going to be the largest technical leap that you've ever seen in the hardware generation.

321
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:04,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll believe it when I see it.

322
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a holodeck?

323
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:11,512
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that every time.

324
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:14,974
[SPEAKER_00]: The technical leap and all that stuff, in one ear, out the other.

325
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.

326
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:20,796
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, it's, you know, okay, they're committed to the hardware game.

327
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:24,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's supposed to be coming, or they're gonna announce it this holiday.

328
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Have they mastered consumer level quantum computing?

329
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anything's possible.

330
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:40,929
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting that, you know, that goes right in the face of why all those people were, you know, smashing their Xboxes and returning to the store and all that stuff last week.

331
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people are dumb.

332
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.

333
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,270
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that.

334
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attention grabbing nonsense.

335
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Hysteria media is, you know, what it was.

336
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, E3VL points out iPhone.

337
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Name any product.

338
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:56,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put any product where you put there.

339
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:58,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Our best yet, it's always that.

340
00:21:58,856 --> 00:21:59,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Always that.

341
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same thing with Xbox.

342
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:01,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it's going to be their best yet.

343
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if it's not their best yet, then why am I buying it?

344
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Or why should I buy it?

345
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's cheaper.

346
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:09,930
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the Xbox Series S. We've decided to lower your expectations.

347
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower Your Expectations

348
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:49,422
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway um yeah i uh it's you know all of this really doesn't seem to be that much the other thing that i kind of caught out of this was the whole like xbox on every screen which is which we knew that's been kind of yeah that's

349
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:50,383
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

350
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:08,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's maybe that's what's coming to holiday me.

351
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know.

352
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

353
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:11,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

354
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

355
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:12,571
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.

356
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:18,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not going to speculate too much more on that because we've all done enough speculation when it comes to Microsoft for an entire five years.

357
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,996
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, here's.

358
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:24,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I think a mistake was made, though.

359
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:27,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I think Phil Spencer's slipping a little bit.

360
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:28,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to look.

361
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:32,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize I've praised the guy a lot.

362
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:35,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's made some bad calls in the last couple of months.

363
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the layoffs don't look good.

364
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:38,305
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not a great thing.

365
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:48,227
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no there's no easy way to slice that, especially doesn't look good when you kind of told the government that isn't exactly what you were going to do and then say, oh, but never mind, because Activision Blizzard was going to do it.

366
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all that.

367
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:50,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Not exactly a layoff.

368
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:51,628
[SPEAKER_00]: That all looks crappy.

369
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:57,231
[SPEAKER_00]: But what really looks crappy, I'm sorry, what was he thinking with that tweet?

370
00:23:57,231 --> 00:24:08,498
[SPEAKER_00]: What on earth was he thinking when he wrote that tweet that said, we hear a lot of buzz and rumors about what's going on and we look forward to clarifying next week?

371
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:12,260
[SPEAKER_00]: There, he should have shut that shit down when he could.

372
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that he needed to quell the hysterical YouTube users.

373
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,403
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm talking about.

374
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:19,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck them and their Xboxes.

375
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:21,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit.

376
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:36,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the runaway clickbait headlines that are the reality of the internet and the reality that way too many people get their news from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,

377
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:38,454
[SPEAKER_00]: and Tik Tok.

378
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,274
[SPEAKER_00]: And those types of things.

379
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:42,475
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get news, they get fed rhetoric.

380
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:44,196
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a sentence.

381
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:48,658
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the thing that's trying to entice you to do more.

382
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:56,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that tweet that he wrote was completely ignorant of that fact that that was going to happen.

383
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:58,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And he easily had an opportunity to say,

384
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:04,523
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear a lot of rumors about the future of Xbox.

385
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:12,215
[SPEAKER_00]: We remain committed to Xbox as a platform, including hardware, and we look forward to sharing our vision next week.

386
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's like you should be in PR or something.

387
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:20,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

388
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:25,685
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like I've had to explain things to people in different ways a few times in my life, but we're not going to go there.

389
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:27,626
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is it.

390
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I just.

391
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to my job.

392
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:39,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe that like he didn't craft a better tweet to stop this hysteria from getting out of fucking control when he could have done it.

393
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their marketing team that should have, or was, no, was it his own account?

394
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was his own marketing team.

395
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:45,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure.

396
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:47,413
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is also a chance.

397
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a team did that, but still, yeah.

398
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:58,337
[SPEAKER_06]: To build more buzz, hopefully, in their, like, to try to turn it around, to build a little bit more buzz in, hopefully, a positive way.

399
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:01,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they say that there's no such thing as bad advertise, as a,

400
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Advertising

401
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:22,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure just for sake, I get the full tweet here.

402
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:22,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.

403
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, what are these replies?

404
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:25,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand this.

405
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:31,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but just pay attention to the top of the screen here where it says, we're listening and we hear you.

406
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:39,196
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox.

407
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:48,299
[SPEAKER_00]: He left this wide fucking open for people to say, oh, this means Xbox is now a publishing platform.

408
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,560
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to make hardware anymore.

409
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,821
[SPEAKER_00]: He should have said in that post, they're still committed to hardware.

410
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why he left the door wide open like that.

411
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:01,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I've said a lot of great things about Phil, but I got a call.

412
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:04,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to call it out on both sides.

413
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:05,223
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's right, it's right.

414
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,463
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's wrong, it's wrong.

415
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:07,484
[SPEAKER_00]: This was wrong.

416
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:08,184
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bad move.

417
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,025
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what this makes me think of?

418
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:22,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Eddie Izzard said this at the start of a performance that the thing that's best is the anticipation right before the event happens.

419
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:27,091
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you speculate and you think and you get excited or it could be this, it could be that.

420
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when it finally happens, it's like, oh, yeah.

421
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:59,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be very definitely I would be very curious what Xbox console sales look like between the time that tweet happened and the time the event happened now granted it's February and you know it's they haven't had a new console in a bit they were probably pretty low anyway but I would be very curious what financial impact that tweet had because I bet it had some probably not a ton but some

422
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,575
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

423
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:28,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand why it won't.

424
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:34,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's probably Xbox fans that would hit me with a rolled up newspaper to kind of paraphrase what someone said in chat a little bit ago.

425
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:42,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's people that would say that, but I don't see how that wouldn't make that game and its reception even better to have a chance.

426
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,467
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything I said last week.

427
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:50,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Relaunch, redo it on the PlayStation with the patch and the DLC and everything.

428
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Redo it with Nintendo Switch, LOL.

429
00:28:53,293 --> 00:29:01,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It would literally implode on itself because it's running on such an old engine that maybe they just can't do it or they just...

430
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,311
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know how to do it correctly.

431
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:14,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what PogCulture says in chat, pull a No Man's Sky or a Diablo 3 or any, you know, any of these other games that, you know, used a multi-platform approach as a relaunch of the game.

432
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:22,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little shocked that they're not willing to gamble with Starfield because I feel like Starfield has already made all the money it's going to make.

433
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not try to gamble to get a little more?

434
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:27,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm just, I am legit surprised.

435
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:28,558
[SPEAKER_00]: The Indiana Jones game

436
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:30,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm surprised.

437
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:33,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not surprised all they're they're saying Nope, this was this was Xbox.

438
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:39,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I do see even with these other four games are talking about going multi platform.

439
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:41,888
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all been out for a year.

440
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:47,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually a game sells what it's going to sell to the fans in a first year.

441
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:50,534
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything after that is just icing on the cake.

442
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:54,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the Sony stuff like that, like a Final Fantasy seven remake.

443
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,161
[SPEAKER_00]: and Matt.

444
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:16,035
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still gonna mean a lot to have something exclusive for a period of time on the Microsoft platform.

445
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:17,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

446
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:21,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Sj100mat says the game still has a lot of problems that they're still working on.

447
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,861
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing they want to do is getting it on other consoles when they're too busy working to fix it.

448
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:26,963
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the timing's not right for this announcement.

449
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

450
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:32,227
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just, I will say, I wouldn't have seen the harm.

451
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:38,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if they said we had five games going multi-platform and Starfield was one of them, I would have said, yep, makes perfect sense.

452
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:42,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still would have said this is a hamburger with nothing on it.

453
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:46,919
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not as big of a deal as everybody was making it out to be.

454
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,886
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not Microsoft goes Sega and this whole thing.

455
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:57,988
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see how the strategy continues to work out for them.

456
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:06,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think, you know, as cloud gaming gets more and more popular, it's going to be a very big disruptor in what we think of as far as traditional hardware.

457
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:09,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of see Microsoft is ahead of the curve on some of that.

458
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.

459
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,203
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what develops.

460
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:21,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Starfield Game of the Year Editions with expansions releasing in 2025 for PCs, Xbox, and PS5.

461
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:21,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

462
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:24,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.

463
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:28,733
[SPEAKER_00]: When Starfield will be out of Early Access, it will be on other places like Skyrim.

464
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Ouch.

465
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,096
[SPEAKER_00]: How true.

466
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:41,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough about the Xbox drama now that we know, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week with How Was Your Gaming Week.

467
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:43,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

468
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,781
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your gaming week?

469
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it was pretty good.

470
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:52,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the last bit of the Dead by Daylight, Lights Out, and I loved it.

471
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:56,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I really had such a good time with it.

472
00:31:56,775 --> 00:32:00,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I pretty much played nothing but pig and hag.

473
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:01,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I played a hag game.

474
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:02,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I, um...

475
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,109
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?

476
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:10,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I've played Genshin Impact.

477
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't decided on which RPG I'm going to play next.

478
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:20,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I might go back and just start over on Star Ocean, but I'm kind of not feeling it.

479
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:26,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So since I don't have a game in mind for Retro Night, I'm just playing Genshin Impact.

480
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been super fun.

481
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:29,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Played a little pinball.

482
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:34,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Genshin Impact and Dead by Daylight

483
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:50,657
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

484
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:55,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with, well, I'm assuming you mean Battle Royale within Fortnite.

485
00:32:55,379 --> 00:33:00,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say start with Lego Fortnite, because it's a completely different game.

486
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, I think it's fun.

487
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, there's Fortnite Festival.

488
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:05,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to play with my friends.

489
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, yeah, then.

490
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can play Lego Fortnite.

491
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:09,104
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get it.

492
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:11,325
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're all playing the Battle Royale, then you would be in there too.

493
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:11,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.

494
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:11,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.

495
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:19,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, although like I would just like nothing but like a build mode.

496
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:20,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do nothing but build.

497
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,712
[SPEAKER_06]: But like in the normal version and not Lego-ish.

498
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you can do that in a creative mode.

499
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:30,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people have their own islands and stuff.

500
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:32,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that's a thing.

501
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super familiar with it.

502
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,438
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if that's a thing, sign me up.

503
00:33:36,438 --> 00:33:40,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look at look at some of the more like artistic things they put in Fortnite sometimes.

504
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll find your jam in there.

505
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:44,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.

506
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll see.

507
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:46,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

508
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:54,625
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody in chat is a little more familiar with it than I am, by all means, be very curious to refer Jamie to that type of stuff.

509
00:33:54,625 --> 00:34:02,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I'm also waiting for Islands of Insight to get a GeForce version so I can play it because I've been excited about that.

510
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:04,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

511
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:04,769
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

512
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:07,870
[SPEAKER_06]: The new behavior MMO.

513
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

514
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

515
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, we'll go to you.

516
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:11,911
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your gaming week?

517
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: My week was finishing up my video that is playing behind me now.

518
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a new episode out now that was on the Fever Dream SMP, which took place back in January.

519
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of tying in with the Channel 64 SMP in the sense that I have lore that kind of starts off there.

520
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:36,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, the whole thing, I mean, like it sounds, it's a fever dream.

521
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:39,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So as that SMP went on, it was

522
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,951
[SPEAKER_04]: more and more chaotic.

523
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:44,153
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept adding more things that were strange in it.

524
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:47,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my video is also very strange.

525
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the complete opposite of the content that I normally make.

526
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:57,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of a satire on the modern Minecraft YouTuber, I guess, if you will.

527
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:08,549
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the quick, the over editing, the shouting at the camera, the constant calls to action for like subscribing and liking stuff.

528
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:08,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It's

529
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, but it's also funny.

530
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:14,192
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I thought it was great parody.

531
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:14,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched it.

532
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:15,993
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was great parody.

533
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:17,314
[SPEAKER_00]: You're funny.

534
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's it's, you know, it gets dark in parts and stuff, but it's also going to tie in, like I said, with our season.

535
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:26,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So it works out in that sense.

536
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's been it was good.

537
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

538
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:36,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping that it would pop off a bit more than it did, because, you know, I thought that for sure that thumbnail be very clickbaity and

539
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:40,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And we built it by community, which was fun.

540
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:47,077
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, lots of people suggesting all sorts of red arrows to put on it and everything, just to a ridiculous extent.

541
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a lot of fun.

542
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've been working on designing my dark

543
00:35:55,428 --> 00:36:19,111
[SPEAKER_04]: My water dark ride that I've got so I'm doing a theme park this season and I'm going through the process to design rides like you would an actual like theme park ride so including all the theming and everything like that so I've been working on a water ride a dark ride that's kind of similar to like not Pirates of the Caribbean but in that sense like you know your Disney rides where you're in a boat and water and stuff

544
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:24,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you're supposed to be target shooting raccoons that have taken over a lumber mill.

545
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:29,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's like a, it's just, you're not like killing them.

546
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,581
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just capturing them.

547
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:33,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I mean, you're not killing them.

548
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,105
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just, you know, no, no, seriously.

549
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're not supposed, you're not killing them.

550
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:44,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're not, they're not even really raccoons essentially, but, um, it, it's just, it's a silly ride and that hopefully,

551
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:45,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

552
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

553
00:37:29,938 --> 00:37:35,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which was pretty, you know, I, I play a lot of Final Fantasy 14.

554
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, uh, again, one of my friends recently started playing that IRL.

555
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:43,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been helping him through the game and just, you know, doing a lot of roulettes and stuff like that.

556
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:46,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, working on my Dark Knight is level 89 now.

557
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:49,944
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one level before cap and just, you know, working on the different stuff in that game.

558
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:53,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I made my mini goals and honestly, that has been really the bulk of my week.

559
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:54,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played a lot of other stuff.

560
00:37:55,165 --> 00:38:21,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, yes, there was an expansion to No Man's Sky, sort of, a patch, I shouldn't say expansion, a patch, which is usually the type of thing I get right on there and stream right away, but just with how busy everything has been between, you know, prepping for crews, day job stuff, and my dad's stuff all going on at once, there just, there really has not been room for that type of stuff, but I look forward very much to checking that all out when I get back from my trip along with Final Fantasy VII

561
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:22,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebirth

562
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:49,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Rock Band 3, which had a keyboard or if you want to go way back to Bomani Games, Drum Mania, right?

563
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:51,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Keyboard Mania was always my jam.

564
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,291
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved Keyboard Mania.

565
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Keyboard Rock Band 3.

566
00:38:53,651 --> 00:39:01,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm so happy that they're putting more synthesizer and keyboard songs and really general like pop songs into Fortnite Festival.

567
00:39:01,316 --> 00:39:08,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Just yesterday in the rotation, they had what Into You by Ariana Grande, some Selena Gomez song I never heard, but it was actually good.

568
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.

569
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And What Is Love by Hadaway.

570
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you did keyboard stuff if it would work with a MIDI keyboard?

571
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:33,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, because there's only five lanes.

572
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe because of the rock band, there was only five lanes in most modes.

573
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:40,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was like a real keyboard mode, if I remember right.

574
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,745
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time you played, you had the same five lane thing.

575
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:45,647
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it could do a similar thing to rock band three.

576
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:51,731
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's actually a really good question for when they release the plastic instruments and that whole thing.

577
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:55,713
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would assume that your guitar just becomes your keyboard.

578
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:58,875
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would be thrilled if they would have like a little keyboard.

579
00:39:58,875 --> 00:39:59,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have.

580
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:08,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a USB MIDI keyboard that like, if I could do keyboard parts, like on a keyboard, maybe I'd actually learn how to use it.

581
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I of course, I'm sitting here going, I would be thrilled.

582
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:14,562
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also know myself, I'd use it like twice and be like, that was fun.

583
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:22,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it just, you know, is this extra thing I have, you know, in my, in my room, but I think one of our emails tonight gets into this later.

584
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll, we'll save that for them.

585
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:24,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have email.

586
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:25,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh huh.

587
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:30,572
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, that's it for really my gaming week was just those two things.

588
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:33,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to when I get back and starting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

589
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:37,758
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, let's get into more gaming news.

590
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:42,642
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, hey, you know what talking about rumors served us so well last week.

591
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:44,724
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing.

592
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:45,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I know,

593
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:51,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you know, it's like, why would you talk about rumors on a gaming news podcast?

594
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:54,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never said this is a gaming news podcast.

595
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:59,057
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the show where we talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

596
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:05,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say these types of rumors and things that go around social media, especially when they catch fire and all that stuff.

597
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby says at me next time.

598
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,921
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at everyone.

599
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:10,142
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not at one specific person.

600
00:41:10,142 --> 00:41:11,923
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you believe it applies, apply it.

601
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:32,903
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, but no, all joking aside, like, you know, that's especially when things catch this type of fire that, because even when I first read this, I was like, I rolled my eyes and I was like, whatever, this is like some random website in Brazil talking about this, but, but now like, it won't go away.

602
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:39,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it keeps catching fire and it feels like everything is starting to collaborate with this, where there might be some sense of truth to this.

603
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:42,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, I'll let you clarify what we're talking about here.

604
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:51,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so apparently the rumor is that the Nintendo Switch successor is going to be coming out next year, or been pushed back.

605
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:52,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's been pushed back.

606
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anyone really think it was coming out this year?

607
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:11,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, so we have, of course, you know, that Brazilian publication that found the information they said from five sources, then that got backed up later on by from Eurogamer, which also heard similar things from their sources.

608
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,054
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I paid attention, for the record.

609
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:17,917
[SPEAKER_00]: When Eurogamer collaborated, I was like, oh, okay, shit, there might be something here.

610
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:33,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And then VGC also collaborated as well, saying their sources have, that publications have been told that, or I should say, publishers have been told that Nintendo has been pushing the console to launch in Q1 2025.

611
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:36,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could see that, you know, March,

612
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:40,042
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of when the Switch came out.

613
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:43,683
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I I don't think there's any problem with a first quarter launch.

614
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:46,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo has shown it doesn't fucking matter when they put out a new console.

615
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:47,984
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to buy it.

616
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:51,086
[SPEAKER_00]: That that part isn't the surprising part.

617
00:42:51,086 --> 00:42:58,328
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I think it's the fact that really everybody's expectations has been 2024 Nintendo.

618
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:03,810
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really time to catch up on technology and they're letting it slip further.

619
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,790
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surprising.

620
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's not.

621
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:08,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the long game is important.

622
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,170
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was launching strongly.

623
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,031
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, because again, it was a bunch of stuff that had already been out for a year.

624
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:36,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember their strategic key partnership with EA that was launched?

625
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:38,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that fucking fizzled so fucking fast.

626
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:41,813
[SPEAKER_00]: My God, EA left them at the altar after like 60 days.

627
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:43,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild.

628
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:45,614
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you know, they didn't have the long game.

629
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:53,336
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have that year of releases to keep things going and keep the Wii U buoyed throughout those early years.

630
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:54,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just tumbled down the hill from there.

631
00:43:55,296 --> 00:44:00,492
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they are delaying it to make sure that the chess pieces are aligned so that way...

632
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:07,678
[SPEAKER_00]: There's games that come out in March, a game in April, a game in May, a game in June, because that's kind of what they did with the Switch.

633
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:21,049
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the release patterns, yes, it released in March, but they made sure whether it was them or a third party partner, they had a major release coming in April, May, June, July, August, they made sure they were doing one a month.

634
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:28,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that might be why this delay in the moment feels a little concerning because, well, then what are they going to do this year?

635
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the answer is they don't really have to do shit.

636
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:35,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the switch is still selling Nintendo.

637
00:44:35,563 --> 00:44:37,204
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done well.

638
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:39,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know what they could do?

639
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:46,249
[SPEAKER_00]: They could finally put the fucking Netflix paramount plus those apps on it, you know, but I guess it's gone.

640
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:47,590
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone this long without it.

641
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Who needs it?

642
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,991
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, but I don't know.

643
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,153
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I would anticipate.

644
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:59,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We get something that's going to be easy for them to throw together, which sounds really bad.

645
00:44:59,651 --> 00:45:06,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't so mean it that way, but I mean like a Wii U remaster, which I know what's left.

646
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:07,358
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot left.

647
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:07,838
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wonderful 101.

648
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe?

649
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,242
[SPEAKER_00]: They can remaster the remasters.

650
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Remaster Wind Waker.

651
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:14,803
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'll tell you exactly what it is.

652
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:18,165
[SPEAKER_00]: ZWA Chronicles X, that one, the one that was Wii U exclusive.

653
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:19,486
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be one of them.

654
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:28,389
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something that they could they could very easily buff up and put out for the holiday or something like that.

655
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:36,453
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's if that's what the holiday releases start looking like, then, you know, yeah, that's that's what happened is this thing is definitely delayed to 2025.

656
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:38,014
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you really delay?

657
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:42,909
[SPEAKER_00]: a game, a console that was never announced in the first place.

658
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:54,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no, that's what I say is like, you know, delayed in the sense that maybe you were expecting in 2024, but no one said anything about it coming out in 2024 or even being announced in 2024.

659
00:45:54,073 --> 00:45:57,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that, you know, that was the assumption, I guess.

660
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been a while.

661
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,677
[SPEAKER_00]: SJ100 Matt in chat says, yeah, there's some smoke to this rumor.

662
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:06,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo did nothing holiday window 2016 and they were just fine.

663
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they weren't fine.

664
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:10,563
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wii U was kind of tanking.

665
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:12,024
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a slightly different.

666
00:46:12,024 --> 00:46:12,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get what you're saying.

667
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:15,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they ended up OK in the long run, and that's what's important.

668
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,648
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Wii U is in a very different place than where the Switch is now.

669
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:19,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

670
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a little bit of a difference there.

671
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,172
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if Nintendo kind of.

672
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, it just hit me.

673
00:46:27,182 --> 00:46:28,943
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what this is what they'll do.

674
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:31,964
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how Nintendo salvages their holiday period.

675
00:46:31,964 --> 00:46:34,185
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna have nothing to do with the switch.

676
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:36,226
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna put out a new classic system.

677
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Guaranteed.

678
00:46:37,107 --> 00:46:38,087
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they'll do.

679
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,568
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do one of the they'll do an emulation hardware thing.

680
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:47,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, like the NES classic SNES classic, maybe a Game Boy, a disk system classic.

681
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:49,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't hear Rob.

682
00:47:07,763 --> 00:47:15,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Gameboy Classic, N64 Classic, and I said maybe even an NES Classic Volume 2 or an SNES Classic Volume 2.

683
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's to stop them from doing that?

684
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:18,233
[SPEAKER_00]: People would pick that up as well.

685
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said a disc classic as well.

686
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:24,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they'll do the top loader system.

687
00:47:24,979 --> 00:47:28,263
[SPEAKER_00]: You joke, but yes, it will be that.

688
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:37,069
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will have different games, maybe that they've worked with third-party publishers, and maybe repeat some of the classics in there as well.

689
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:41,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they would, because I think it would devalue... I mean, maybe.

690
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Game Boy, I could... I don't know.

691
00:47:43,914 --> 00:47:50,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think that their path now is that they want to push people to Nintendo Switch Online in the expansion path, so...

692
00:47:52,458 --> 00:48:01,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great idea because, you know, Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass is only $25 in a year, whereas the console, they could sell it for $100, but I don't know.

693
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:02,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

694
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:05,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, respectfully, totally disagree.

695
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:09,601
[SPEAKER_00]: The NES classic and the SNES classic didn't do a damn thing to sales or cannibalize.

696
00:48:09,601 --> 00:48:23,056
[SPEAKER_00]: People still wanted those things and I think if they did an N64 classic or a top loader NES classic or a Game Boy, which would be the three likely candidates to me, as a fan, now as a fan, DarkSakura,

697
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:27,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love, love exactly what you're talking about.

698
00:48:27,217 --> 00:48:32,619
[SPEAKER_00]: A disc system with a bunch of games that have never been released in the U.S.

699
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:33,700
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.

700
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:46,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just, you know, most people have never, even though you can do it on the Switch's virtual console or whatever, I'm sorry, the Switch Online, you can play Metroid with the extra sound chip.

701
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:49,686
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll put it, they can do a whole- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, like an FM series.

702
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:49,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

703
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:53,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe even coordinate with Sega.

704
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:58,914
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually do a good master system mini.

705
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:18,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have the Famicom Mini.

706
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:23,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Blackwolf points out, my in-laws have an NES Classic because my mother-in-law grew up playing NES games.

707
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,472
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't want to switch, it's too complex.

708
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:27,714
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot they could do with an NES Classic.

709
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:36,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, just piggybacking right on Bobby Blackwolf's comment about they have an NES Classic because they grew up playing NES games.

710
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:47,233
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge game that everybody grew up playing that has never been in one of these releases, and it's not on Switch Online either.

711
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:49,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Duck Hunt.

712
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:50,957
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.

713
00:49:50,957 --> 00:49:53,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Because guns are hard to do when you don't have a CRT.

714
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:55,645
[SPEAKER_06]: but now

715
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,590
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's it.

716
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a I'm a genius.

717
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark my words.

718
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:19,351
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Nintendo's holiday plan.

719
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:22,892
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to put out a new classic or some type of hardware thing.

720
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:26,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be the thing that moves hardware when the switch is having an off year.

721
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:32,135
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll still they'll still do the the Wii U release or something like that will still be a thing.

722
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:33,515
[SPEAKER_00]: But that'll that'll be it.

723
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:44,217
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkTetsuya says Duck Hunt showed up on Wii U with Wiimote support, so if they could figure that out for a mini, sure.

724
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:51,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bobby Blackwolf says, there is a way to do light gun games on modern LCDs, Arcade1Up figured it out.

725
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:53,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I think we have another light gun story coming up later.

726
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to be fair, you could take one of those.

727
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:56,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the Wii

728
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,250
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it, the Wii console that they put out?

729
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:13,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the very end of the life cycle of the Wii that had, like, no internet access, like, no GameCube backwards compatibility and stuff like that, and they were selling it for, like, I think it was, it was under, like, a hundred bucks, I think.

730
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,568
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the Wii, it was the Wii.

731
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:17,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

732
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,808
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Wii.

733
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:20,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

734
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what they called it.

735
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:22,212
[SPEAKER_04]: They called it something different.

736
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Wii, but it had like an extra name on it.

737
00:51:24,955 --> 00:51:26,516
[SPEAKER_04]: They could repurpose that.

738
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that thing could emulate, obviously, Nintendo games since it did.

739
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have a light gun right there because you have the Wii remotes.

740
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:43,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be fair to DarkSakura's original point about the fact that Duck Hunt would have to be repurposed, in a sense, to run now.

741
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just stating why it hadn't been done to this date.

742
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:46,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

743
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:57,599
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also one of the things, to that point, is that the NES classic, the SES classic, they were nice, they were cute, but they were just ROMs thrown on a piece of hardware.

744
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo, if they really went in, think about the rich trove

745
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:05,323
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that Nintendo is sitting on that they could do.

746
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:14,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, they could do some of their satellites, Teleview games, now that those are all back, and they could do something that incorporates all of those.

747
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:20,311
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do- And all they have to do is work with the fan translators, because like some of those games have already been fully dumped and translated.

748
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:22,632
[SPEAKER_06]: There was the thing we talked about F-Zero last week.

749
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:22,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

750
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:28,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's legal reasons they don't do that, but it would- I don't think it would be very hard for them to translate internally.

751
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:37,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, they've done it before, like they've put out the like they did Star Fox 2, you know, finally gave us a full release of that.

752
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

753
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:38,631
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're right.

754
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,231
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.

755
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:43,254
[SPEAKER_06]: They they've got all of the material for the Satellaview games.

756
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:53,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that, you know, if they see how popular that ended up being, maybe they would translate some of the Satellaview games or put them in a standard play version.

757
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:53,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

758
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:58,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying this for years.

759
00:52:58,623 --> 00:53:04,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for Nintendo to embrace the randomizer concept with some of their old games.

760
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:07,286
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to use the literal stuff that's out there now.

761
00:53:07,286 --> 00:53:11,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo could come up with their own thing to do a true randomizer for something like Metroid

762
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:38,494
[SPEAKER_00]: or Zelda 1 or you know all these games that get this treatment and I think that would be so much fun and people would be so into that so I I feel like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit Nintendo could do to make something that would be very mildly interesting for the holiday that they just they just have to do it so we'll see but anyway yes if this if the switch is delayed then fine whatever they're doing it for the right reasons and even though we sit here going wow 2024 is gonna suck

763
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:44,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo's position strongly for 2025, so what does it matter in the long game?

764
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:49,989
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying 2024 doesn't have to suck, Nintendo.

765
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:52,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.

766
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:57,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. C in chat says this reminds me I saw an article on one of the blogs about NES Remix.

767
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:58,891
[SPEAKER_00]: They should bring that back in some form.

768
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:01,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yes, NES Remix was awesome.

769
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,393
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.

770
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:07,634
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on and talk about this headline that kind of

771
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:28,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinda slipped under a little bit considering all the things going on with Xbox, but how different at its core, really, is this comment, besides the obvious, from Sony President Hiroki Totoki, who was talking recently in an earnings call Q&A session.

772
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:36,087
[SPEAKER_00]: He was asked about Sony's profits not keeping up with increasing gross income, and he mentioned that hardware and first-party games were areas of focus,

773
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:43,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardware cost reduction was difficult to come by, so don't expect the price of a PS5 to drop.

774
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:54,051
[SPEAKER_00]: But then goes on to say, I personally think there are opportunities out there for improvement of margin, so I would like to go aggressive on improving our margin performance.

775
00:54:54,051 --> 00:55:01,593
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we wanted to popularize consoles, and a first-party title's main purpose was to make the console popular.

776
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:04,994
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true, but there's a synergy to it.

777
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:20,021
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have strong first party content, not only on our console, but also other platforms like computers, a first party game can be grown with multi platform, and that can help operating profit to improve.

778
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:22,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another one we want to proactively work on.

779
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:27,814
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sony also talking about multi-platform.

780
00:55:27,814 --> 00:55:30,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, not Xbox, not Switch.

781
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:31,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

782
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:34,639
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at that quote and what he's saying.

783
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:37,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that different from Xbox?

784
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:40,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox is just taking this road to get to that point.

785
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony is taking a different road to get to that point.

786
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:50,451
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's at the same at the end of the day, it's a first party game can be grown with multi-platform and that can help the overall profit to improve.

787
00:55:52,202 --> 00:55:54,998
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just- But wait, where are the people throwing away their PlayStation 5s?

788
00:55:56,584 --> 00:56:05,532
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna because, well, actually, Loki, to be fair, when they first went to Steam and PC, we saw the YouTube hysteria on that front.

789
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,713
[SPEAKER_00]: That did happen.

790
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:12,177
[SPEAKER_00]: To be completely fair, Sony fanboys are just as insufferable as the Xbox ones, okay?

791
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:14,479
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all bad.

792
00:56:14,479 --> 00:56:19,223
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and this far along, does it really matter at the end of the day?

793
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it really killed the PlayStation exclusives?

794
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:22,006
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

795
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:38,863
[SPEAKER_00]: But, he did point out, in 2022, at the time, he said PC gamers would have to wait at least a year to play things like God of War 2018, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Miles Morales was actually a two year turnaround.

796
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:51,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to note, Helldivers 2, a Sony game, just came out on February 8th on PlayStation 5 and Windows, and it's doing very well.

797
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:52,792
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that again later in the show.

798
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:58,415
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it is doing better than they expected it to do, which is very interesting.

799
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,416
[SPEAKER_00]: So now again,

800
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:06,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike Microsoft, Sony didn't name any specifics because this was more of an asterisk during a Q&A at the call.

801
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:09,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know if we're talking about like, does this mean Wolverine?

802
00:57:09,298 --> 00:57:12,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this mean, you know, a potential future Naughty Dog game or anything?

803
00:57:12,479 --> 00:57:15,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all know Last of Us 3 is going to happen eventually.

804
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.

805
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:23,362
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is very interesting that Sony also sees the benefit of going multi platform.

806
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:24,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is

807
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:29,747
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think that window of the year might get a little smaller, but not too much.

808
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:34,429
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't know if we see a lot of same day and date, like we're seeing with Helldivers 2.

809
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:41,033
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe, maybe the Helldivers 2 is a very interesting because I that game was not on my radar at all.

810
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:45,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's, I feel like lots of people are talking about that.

811
00:57:45,216 --> 00:57:48,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, let's move on.

812
00:57:48,418 --> 00:57:50,919
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, I know you love to talk about classics here.

813
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:53,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is definitely something with the classics, right?

814
00:57:54,662 --> 00:57:59,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rob, are you familiar with the term, um, kusoge?

815
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no.

816
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:04,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Kuso means shit.

817
00:58:04,268 --> 00:58:07,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it means shitty game.

818
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:17,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they have, there is a translation patch for a Dreamcast light gun game that is a pretty shitty game.

819
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:28,396
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does have some notable music to it, and it's just got a lot of stuff to it.

820
00:58:28,396 --> 00:58:39,479
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's called Death Crimson II, Altar of Melanito, and there is an English patch put out for it.

821
00:58:39,479 --> 00:58:43,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Bobby points out about the Cuso Grande,

822
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:49,175
[SPEAKER_06]: which is, you know, same thing.

823
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:59,563
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also cheat codes that let you use the L and R trigger to increase your credit counts and change your timer.

824
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:09,771
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a patch online that you can go get from Derek Pascarella, P-A-S-C-A-R-E-L-L-A, on...

825
00:59:15,703 --> 00:59:16,504
[SPEAKER_06]: and Bobby Blackwolf

826
00:59:42,403 --> 00:59:50,888
[SPEAKER_06]: We were watching that just on their channel as like, it was like an ongoing thing just on the channel itself.

827
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:53,390
[SPEAKER_06]: We would sometimes watch and go, hey, I know that game.

828
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

829
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

830
00:59:55,752 --> 00:59:56,972
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

831
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:58,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's move on.

832
00:59:58,974 --> 00:59:59,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki.

833
01:00:00,946 --> 01:00:02,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yes.

834
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:03,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's funny.

835
01:00:03,368 --> 01:00:04,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not funny.

836
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:08,652
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this is funny, but it, it reminds me of EA in a sense.

837
01:00:08,652 --> 01:00:13,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So Embracer has canceled nearly 30 unannounced games in the last six months.

838
01:00:15,938 --> 01:00:26,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think about it, it's very, this feels a lot like EA and how they used to basically buy up studios and then those studios just go under.

839
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But except they're just speed running this now.

840
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:31,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the last physical report,

841
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:33,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Disgusting.

842
01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:19,233
[SPEAKER_00]: and I and all these people who had nothing to do with that decision are the ones that are having to pay for it and it's just it's just so gross the entire mismanagement of the whole thing like I almost feel like certain executives should be personally accountable for some of this stuff it's so bad

843
01:01:20,037 --> 01:01:22,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, I would imagine.

844
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see that lawsuit happen.

845
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, you know, technically, I think a lot of those executives aren't based here.

846
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:28,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's overseas.

847
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:29,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets complicated.

848
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:35,908
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just it's just really gross to see how horribly mismanaged the whole thing was.

849
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:40,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying all this stuff just to shut it all down sucks.

850
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:43,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I don't care as long as they still have their money.

851
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:47,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about something that's completely different.

852
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:56,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a company that knows how to keep a good thing going and support, support, support a game with free patches, even though you bought it one time.

853
01:01:56,216 --> 01:02:01,759
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, maybe when you first bought it, it wasn't great, but it's hard to say that this game isn't in a great place now.

854
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, of course, is No Man's Sky.

855
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to admit, I was kind of wondering, like, when's the next patch coming?

856
01:02:07,782 --> 01:02:08,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a minute.

857
01:02:08,662 --> 01:02:12,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, this week, in comes the Omega patch.

858
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:18,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And is the Omega patch, a lot of folks wondering, is the Omega patch the final patch for No Man's Sky?

859
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:20,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's called Omega.

860
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:21,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, folks.

861
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:26,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called that because some of the elements of this actually affect the ending.

862
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:32,282
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the Atlas ending a little bit to have a little more choice with it, but...

863
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:50,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Games has kind of said that they're not ending No Man's Sky support because of Light No Fire, which you know, of course, the folks that made No Man's Sky are working on a kind of single planet sort of game called Light No Fire at this point.

864
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:54,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have explicitly said they're not stopping No Man's Sky.

865
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:58,471
[SPEAKER_00]: It might get scaled back a little bit, but they're still going to continue on that game.

866
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:00,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think Omega needs ending at this point.

867
01:03:00,671 --> 01:03:03,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there would have been a lot more fanfare if that was going to be the case.

868
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:03,912
[SPEAKER_00]: But

869
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:05,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me.

870
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:08,138
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else is sorry how to root beer.

871
01:03:08,138 --> 01:03:13,044
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think is very interesting is that the game actually was free to play this weekend.

872
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:16,870
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to say by the time most of you are hearing this, that free to play window is done.

873
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:17,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably missed it.

874
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:19,253
[SPEAKER_00]: But the game was free to play.

875
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:21,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitch Twitch Drops

876
01:03:38,115 --> 01:04:06,475
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a new expedition and it sounds like they've already kind of really changed up the expedition system so instead of having to create a whole new game a whole new save file for the expedition you can fire up the expedition in your existing save which is a very big quality of life thing for a lot of people that want to like have their main save and not all these sub saves and all that so that's pretty cool and then they're doing um a brand new ship type uh there's a really cool staff that they have now in place of a multi-tool so you can look like a

877
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:07,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Pirate Fleets

878
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:23,837
[SPEAKER_00]: QuestBuster says it was wild seeing so many people in the player hubs.

879
01:04:38,982 --> 01:04:41,123
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

880
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:04,674
[SPEAKER_00]: and so like I'm going to have maybe a week when I get back and I want to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

881
01:05:04,674 --> 01:05:12,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might miss this one, but I'm going to try not to because I love No Man's Sky is just one of my go to comfort games.

882
01:05:12,337 --> 01:05:13,897
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my comfort food.

883
01:05:13,897 --> 01:05:16,358
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my it's my Taco Bell.

884
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:22,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat it every day, but once in a while I crave it and I want it and I go play it.

885
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:24,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.

886
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:25,442
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

887
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:28,503
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura with another cool little classic update.

888
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:39,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Switch had a new release on the 15th and that is the

889
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:45,481
[SPEAKER_06]: East for the PC-8801.

890
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:50,224
[SPEAKER_06]: As in, it's a very different... Well, actually, I take that back.

891
01:05:50,224 --> 01:05:54,707
[SPEAKER_06]: East... I was thinking of Valis, never mind.

892
01:05:54,707 --> 01:06:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still... It's the original... One of the original versions of East.

893
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:01,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be $6.49.

894
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,134
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a small little game.

895
01:06:05,134 --> 01:06:11,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's the game that began the East series put out by Nihon Falcom.

896
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:15,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely it's worth it.

897
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:20,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my jam was YS III and I like the series.

898
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:24,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to know where now we're like what on YS IX, something like that.

899
01:06:24,802 --> 01:06:27,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say X. Are we?

900
01:06:27,763 --> 01:06:28,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost.

901
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:31,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say I saw like YX.

902
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:35,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's YS, but YX.

903
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:35,806
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.

904
01:06:35,806 --> 01:06:36,986
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I saw a thing of that.

905
01:06:38,348 --> 01:06:41,291
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, you can go back and play the original.

906
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:50,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually been dubbed Egg Console East PC 8801 Mark 2 SR.

907
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:50,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like Iron Man's arm.

908
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:58,894
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura in chat says, I'm tempted to get it just to show the wife some of the early Falcom stuff.

909
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:02,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently it's still in Japanese, but I'm sure Google Translate might help.

910
01:07:02,678 --> 01:07:13,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, oh, well, actually, um, the, um, the menus and how to play is all in English, but the main gaming gallery is in Japanese.

911
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so they translate as the the necessary stuff to get through the game.

912
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,435
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like interesting.

913
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:26,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I mean, you won't really unless you know enough Japanese to kind of get the gist of the conversation.

914
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,703
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you will be missing out on some story.

915
01:07:28,703 --> 01:07:37,652
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's still a cool thing for them to release like just and I get you know, Dr. Seuss comment like just almost wanting to buy it just to support this and see this kind of thing.

916
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:37,952
[SPEAKER_00]: No, do

917
01:07:38,152 --> 01:07:39,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that is important.

918
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:45,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if this kind of like really like, let's be honest, this is a deep dive in classics.

919
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:50,902
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not I realize ease is a great thing for a lot of people as are these, you know, Japanese consoles.

920
01:07:50,902 --> 01:07:52,624
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like, let's be real.

921
01:07:52,624 --> 01:07:54,565
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about Mario Brothers or Zelda.

922
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:56,366
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about a re-release of a huge game.

923
01:07:56,366 --> 01:07:58,168
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about something that's rather pretty niche.

924
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:00,549
[SPEAKER_00]: EZ10 Nordics has a page on Steam and is coming out here later

925
01:08:27,222 --> 01:08:31,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, I know it makes you all shiver, but it's funny.

926
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:32,806
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.

927
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:33,907
[SPEAKER_00]: What, Rob?

928
01:08:33,907 --> 01:08:34,568
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

929
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:37,310
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

930
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,091
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

931
01:08:39,091 --> 01:08:40,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, Loki.

932
01:08:42,104 --> 01:08:50,671
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some news regarding a lawsuit against Activision by Optics Gaming.

933
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:53,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too familiar with all of this.

934
01:08:53,673 --> 01:08:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more of the Call of Duty league.

935
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:58,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their professional esports gaming league.

936
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of some of the stuff that went along with that.

937
01:09:01,921 --> 01:09:12,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of for context, apparently before the Call of Duty League, there were other professional Call of Duty kind of tournament setups that were out there.

938
01:09:12,011 --> 01:09:14,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, once Activision purchased

939
01:09:17,526 --> 01:09:27,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the competing leagues, they kind of got it down to almost where it was more of a monopoly on the whole competitive space.

940
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:32,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And so because of that, they were able to leverage some deals that

941
01:09:34,438 --> 01:09:39,443
[SPEAKER_04]: that apparently they found were not beneficial to them.

942
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:51,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So as such, for example, the founder of the group said that Activision forced him to sell the majority of his company in addition to a $27.5 million entry fee to get into the Call of Duty League.

943
01:09:56,459 --> 01:10:07,007
[SPEAKER_04]: and also that they demanded an unconstitutional 50% share of the revenue the teams generated from ticket sales, sponsorships, and other revenue streams.

944
01:10:07,007 --> 01:10:17,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with that, also accusing them of basically forcing players to sign a contract without them being able to run it by their lawyers.

945
01:10:18,977 --> 01:10:20,839
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think there's a case here Loki?

946
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

947
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there is or not.

948
01:10:40,601 --> 01:10:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds to me, this reminds me a lot of like the whole Smash scene and kind of like the stuff that they're, the regulations Nintendo's putting on people that are running tournaments and stuff like that.

949
01:10:52,527 --> 01:10:59,390
[SPEAKER_04]: To a lesser extent, obviously this is much larger than that when we're talking $680 million where some of these Smash tournaments are.

950
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

951
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:16,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.

952
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:21,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Sjohn100mat says, yeah, this and the Overwatch League ended in such disaster.

953
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:25,856
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a bummer to see this sort of setback for gaming sports.

954
01:11:25,856 --> 01:11:26,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

955
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:34,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize people feel some sorts of ways about it, but I, as somebody who was picked on a lot growing up, and I, there's a lot of you that share this with me.

956
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:36,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just talking about myself.

957
01:11:36,445 --> 01:11:51,271
[SPEAKER_00]: As somebody who was picked on a lot growing up because I didn't play sports and I tended to lean more towards video games, seeing video games start to have their place amongst the sports and that type of stuff on, you know, ABC Wild, Wide World of Sports or whatever, kind of felt some sort of way.

958
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:52,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Wide World of Sports, oh my God.

959
01:11:52,812 --> 01:12:01,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it kind of felt some sort of way that felt really good, you know, and it was it's just a bummer that you're having all these setbacks because now it feels like shit.

960
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:08,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe video games aren't going to be able to hold their own there because we keep having these financial and other types of fuck-ups.

961
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:16,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, I mean, in the sports world, they have these same types of arrangements with their players that kind of suck.

962
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:26,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look at the whole college leagues and everything and the amount of ownership that those players have over their likenesses and even some of the EA games and Madden and stuff like that.

963
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:39,625
[SPEAKER_04]: you know there's the whole it's very regulated in that sense and sometimes especially for like people that are not necessarily savvy in legal stuff they can get run over by these companies and

964
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:43,193
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

965
01:13:03,288 --> 01:13:10,133
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's and it's not to say that regular sports quote unquote don't have their problems as well.

966
01:13:10,133 --> 01:13:14,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you all hear the news by the way here here locally in our hometown of Sacramento where we're based?

967
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:17,358
[SPEAKER_00]: We might suddenly have a Major League Baseball team for two years.

968
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:18,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about this?

969
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:18,919
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

970
01:13:18,919 --> 01:13:19,299
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

971
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:20,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we know.

972
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,541
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the latest rumor going around.

973
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:24,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, apparently Vegas isn't ready for the A's.

974
01:13:24,603 --> 01:13:25,664
[SPEAKER_00]: So the A's might move here.

975
01:13:26,204 --> 01:13:27,225
[SPEAKER_00]: for just a couple of years.

976
01:13:27,225 --> 01:13:28,725
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the latest thing people are talking about.

977
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:37,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about it, the park over in West Sac that has the River Cats, like it's actually a pretty decent facility that's relatively newer and I've enjoyed games there.

978
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

979
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:49,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they're talking and the fact that it's, you know, down the street, so to speak, from Oakland, they're talking about the Sacramento is like the leading place to hold the A's for a couple of years before Vegas is ready for them.

980
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:50,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came out of fucking nowhere.

981
01:13:51,772 --> 01:13:54,954
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's because of all the fuckery.

982
01:13:54,954 --> 01:13:55,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't mind.

983
01:13:55,995 --> 01:13:56,695
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wouldn't at all.

984
01:13:56,695 --> 01:13:57,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be very interesting.

985
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:05,080
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's because of all the fuckery of the guy that owns the A's and how he was dicking around the city and all this stuff.

986
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're moving just all the Oakland teams to Vegas now?

987
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:08,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

988
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:09,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what's happening?

989
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

990
01:14:11,444 --> 01:14:13,426
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is happening.

991
01:14:13,426 --> 01:14:18,369
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clever comeback or pun or joke to make because yes, that is happening.

992
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:23,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I would pray they take them somewhere else to train though, cause ugh.

993
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:24,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

994
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

995
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as Jonah Matt says, yeah, the A's move has become a circus.

996
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:29,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, but you know what?

997
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:32,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll like, like DarkSakura said, I'll go, I'll go.

998
01:14:32,192 --> 01:14:32,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

999
01:14:32,492 --> 01:14:35,153
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go watch an A's game at the Sutter Park or whatever.

1000
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:35,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the name.

1001
01:14:35,953 --> 01:14:36,753
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Sutter Park, right?

1002
01:14:36,753 --> 01:14:37,733
[SPEAKER_00]: It's named after Sutter.

1003
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:37,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1004
01:14:37,954 --> 01:14:42,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a good time going to, um, our, our minor league games.

1005
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:42,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1006
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:47,216
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not a bad, it's a smaller facility than a major league stadium.

1007
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're definitely going to take a hit on attendance, but

1008
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is going to A's games anyway?

1009
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:55,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Who told you to move them to Vegas?

1010
01:14:55,802 --> 01:14:59,384
[SPEAKER_00]: More people are going to go to them here than we're probably going in Oakland, to be quite honest.

1011
01:14:59,384 --> 01:15:04,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people in Sacramento will be like, oh, this is this is a novelty, to be honest.

1012
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:07,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're not quite so hot as Las Vegas.

1013
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:08,130
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1014
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:13,794
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like we're like we're like the Sir Robin of of league towns.

1015
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:13,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1016
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:15,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they feed Oakland.

1017
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:31,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were feeding the giant, they feed one of the, they always go back and forth.

1018
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:37,064
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding one Bay Area team or the other, but yes, was there like, you know, ground for that.

1019
01:15:37,064 --> 01:15:39,145
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, Sacramento's still trying to get a soccer team too.

1020
01:15:39,145 --> 01:15:40,146
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been thinking of that.

1021
01:15:40,146 --> 01:15:47,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's been, it's been growing here ever since, ever since they, ever since they put a giant fucking purple laser

1022
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,351
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of NotCo Arena downtown.

1023
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:53,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since they put a big purple laser on top of that thing.

1024
01:15:53,992 --> 01:15:54,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.

1025
01:15:54,752 --> 01:15:56,093
[SPEAKER_00]: NotCo Arena.

1026
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,853
[SPEAKER_00]: NotCo Arena downtown.

1027
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, sports suddenly is like this.

1028
01:16:00,874 --> 01:16:03,875
[SPEAKER_00]: This town is just like, wants more sports.

1029
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a team that's good at sports.

1030
01:16:05,356 --> 01:16:11,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, wow, we actually have the, you know, infrastructure and the people with all the people relocated to support more sports.

1031
01:16:11,718 --> 01:16:14,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I, on the contrary, want more lasers.

1032
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:17,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a laser on every roof.

1033
01:16:17,964 --> 01:16:18,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, think about it.

1034
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:20,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it, Loki.

1035
01:16:20,265 --> 01:16:22,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kings could have their laser like the beam.

1036
01:16:22,766 --> 01:16:31,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Oakland A's could have a green laser, excuse me, the Sacramento A's or the not not yet Vegas A's could have a green laser like that beam.

1037
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:34,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they get to get a soccer team.

1038
01:16:34,352 --> 01:16:35,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Light this beam too.

1039
01:16:35,732 --> 01:16:39,234
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have like fucking 17 lasers going off in the sky all at once.

1040
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:46,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that there's no concern whatsoever being the flight path for the nearby airport as well.

1041
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:49,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that it hasn't stopped the purple laser.

1042
01:16:49,824 --> 01:16:52,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, usually planes don't fly right over downtowns anyway.

1043
01:16:52,747 --> 01:16:55,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why that's why the laser is not a big deal.

1044
01:16:55,289 --> 01:16:56,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway,

1045
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:00,093
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's start.

1046
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:02,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have the Nays playing at NotCo Arena.

1047
01:17:02,975 --> 01:17:03,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down for that.

1048
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:04,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1049
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:08,079
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to apologize to the listeners, starting with PodCulture.

1050
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:15,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to apologize for the fact that even we here at Orange Alliance Radio somehow, after all these years, have succumbed to sports talk.

1051
01:17:15,705 --> 01:17:19,488
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to apologize, everybody.

1052
01:17:19,488 --> 01:17:20,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry about that.

1053
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:21,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about lasers.

1054
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I never mentioned sports at all.

1055
01:17:24,032 --> 01:17:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have the record show.

1056
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:30,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just using it as an excuse to make fun of team names.

1057
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:33,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been a long fan of lasers.

1058
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:37,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I not played like thousands of games of laser tag?

1059
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,303
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because I like the competitiveness of it.

1060
01:17:40,303 --> 01:17:41,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a fan of lasers.

1061
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:42,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Lasers are fucking rad.

1062
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unless we're talking about like that scene in Resident Evil with the lasers, that's a little scary.

1063
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:50,093
[SPEAKER_00]: But like otherwise, lasers that don't cut people up are pretty cool.

1064
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:54,802
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you don't shine directly in people's eyes because that's not fun either.

1065
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:58,025
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the space lasers that just shoot in the sky.

1066
01:17:58,025 --> 01:18:00,868
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty fun.

1067
01:18:00,868 --> 01:18:03,270
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anyway, moving on.

1068
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:04,071
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what else is fun?

1069
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:05,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Video games.

1070
01:18:05,553 --> 01:18:06,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and- Laser tag.

1071
01:18:06,874 --> 01:18:08,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought- Yeah, laser tag is fun.

1072
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:09,737
[SPEAKER_00]: We're overdue to do that.

1073
01:18:11,363 --> 01:18:14,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a game that's been doing very well lately.

1074
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:15,927
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Helldivers 2.

1075
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:17,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this earlier in the show.

1076
01:18:17,809 --> 01:18:19,310
[SPEAKER_00]: It is doing very well.

1077
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:27,818
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Arrowhead Games Studios' newest third-person PvE co-op shooter, and it has broken records for PlayStation Studios.

1078
01:18:27,818 --> 01:18:28,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reached 150,000

1079
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:36,043
[SPEAKER_00]: 150,000 concurrent Steam players on its opening weekend and it is still growing.

1080
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:45,787
[SPEAKER_00]: It has now surpassed the all time concurrent player records of several big games like Starfield, Destiny 2, Halo Infinite.

1081
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:52,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I believe that's on Steam, so I sort of feel like that's an unfair comparison to games that a lot of people are consuming on Game Pass.

1082
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:56,732
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I will let the I will let the comments stand because that is still a lot of people.

1083
01:18:59,036 --> 01:19:07,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently there are server capacity issues resulting from how popular this game is, as tends to happen with video games when they get unexpectedly popular.

1084
01:19:07,379 --> 01:19:16,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Arrowhead has capped Helldiver's two servers to 450,000 concurrent players to try to improve server stability.

1085
01:19:16,282 --> 01:19:20,263
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they will continue to work with partners to get the ceiling raised.

1086
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:21,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Helldiver 2 is doing really well

1087
01:19:39,444 --> 01:19:47,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, although I will, I will point out for Loki, I noticed when I'm looking at some of like the promo art for this game, and maybe Loki, you can see this with me here.

1088
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:54,630
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that in this promotional shot, we have the three people that are, you know, doing their thing, but what's, what's this one got?

1089
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,170
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this one got, Loki?

1090
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,051
[SPEAKER_00]: A laser sight.

1091
01:19:57,051 --> 01:19:58,531
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

1092
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:02,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, maybe we're missing something, Loki.

1093
01:20:02,033 --> 01:20:05,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does certainly look like knockoff stormtroopers, but you know, that's just,

1094
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:07,715
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1095
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1096
01:20:08,316 --> 01:20:09,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.

1097
01:20:09,276 --> 01:20:11,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Quest Buster says it's wild how viral the game has gone.

1098
01:20:11,977 --> 01:20:12,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1099
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:14,298
[SPEAKER_00]: And SEO 100 Matt says it's the new hotness.

1100
01:20:14,298 --> 01:20:16,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, it needs to be something I put on my radar.

1101
01:20:16,299 --> 01:20:19,120
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to watch some people stream at first.

1102
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,722
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually how I feel about these types of games, especially the ones that are asking for $40.

1103
01:20:23,722 --> 01:20:29,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to watch somebody stream at first and see is this for me because I can usually tell pretty quick if it's for me or not.

1104
01:20:29,384 --> 01:20:29,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So

1105
01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:30,429
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1106
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:37,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just not going to like buy into it like some sort of quadruple A game that came out to grave reviews.

1107
01:20:37,472 --> 01:20:43,114
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was amazing and totally not worse than the game that came out 11 years ago.

1108
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:49,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, I didn't even, I didn't even realize that game came out if that tells you how well the marketing is behind that game.

1109
01:20:49,816 --> 01:20:55,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, it's just hilarious like what they, it's so,

1110
01:20:57,253 --> 01:21:08,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's funny because we like think back to like Peter Molyneux and like Molyneux, I guess, and like how like all of the stuff that he said was just a bunch of bullshit.

1111
01:21:08,203 --> 01:21:10,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, nowadays, it's like that.

1112
01:21:10,225 --> 01:21:15,029
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you have Todd Howard, you have just everything thing coming from Ysgamon.

1113
01:21:15,029 --> 01:21:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just it's all bullshit.

1114
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:18,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't believe anybody.

1115
01:21:18,512 --> 01:21:19,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait for the game to come out.

1116
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:20,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't preorder because

1117
01:21:21,174 --> 01:21:23,175
[SPEAKER_04]: They want $70 for that game.

1118
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:24,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's garbage.

1119
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:44,780
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's at very best It's just kind of mid just kind of yeah, whatever, but it's certainly not a quadruple quadruple a game look English is a complicated language Loki and the whole thing was it wasn't a quadruple a game it was a quadruple a Game quadruple a game

1120
01:21:45,816 --> 01:21:49,958
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah, it's just it's sometimes it's hard to know how to pronounce the vowel.

1121
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:51,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's very, it's very complicated.

1122
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:52,719
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's what it is.

1123
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,200
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quadruple a game.

1124
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1125
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:56,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

1126
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:59,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1127
01:21:59,042 --> 01:21:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

1128
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:02,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I didn't even fucking know it came out.

1129
01:22:02,223 --> 01:22:04,444
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that tell you?

1130
01:22:04,444 --> 01:22:12,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it came out because it's fun watching the reviews for it because I know it's going to be just like watching the reviews for like, say, Madam Web or something like that.

1131
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:33,521
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fun because there's a lot of mid stuff happening right now isn't there like what is going on i'm a little afraid for madam webb is a quadruple a movie you just don't understand it's just it goes above everyone's head which is why no no no that no no no loki you have to pronounce the vowels differently there too madam webb is a quadruple

1132
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:34,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Zanadu

1133
01:22:58,079 --> 01:22:58,360
[SPEAKER_04]: and Matt.

1134
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I watch it?

1135
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I am not giving Sony any money for their crappy Spider-Man ripoffs.

1136
01:23:16,103 --> 01:23:21,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them money for Across the Spider-Verse, because that's a good movie.

1137
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:22,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an idea.

1138
01:23:22,307 --> 01:23:29,051
[SPEAKER_04]: You should take your good writers and make them make those movies, not take the writers that put out Morbius and said, hey, you know what?

1139
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:32,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I want more of that.

1140
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:33,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me some more of that Morbius.

1141
01:23:34,554 --> 01:23:40,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they have Madame Web now, which like it's a bunch of characters that don't even.

1142
01:23:40,878 --> 01:23:46,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So like even the marketing was deceptive with it, too, because they showed like all these different spider women in it and stuff.

1143
01:23:46,342 --> 01:23:53,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, that's just like kind of a really quick vision that she gets of the future that like takes place in like 30 seconds or something.

1144
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:55,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of the movie is not that at all.

1145
01:23:55,668 --> 01:23:57,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what they show off in the trailers.

1146
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1147
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:04,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, I wanted to point out pod culture points out Rocky Horror is a bad movie too.

1148
01:24:04,863 --> 01:24:07,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, there's a time and a place for bad movies.

1149
01:24:07,885 --> 01:24:14,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus the thing with Rocky Horror, the whole phenomenon with Rocky Horror has very little to do with the movie actually.

1150
01:24:14,647 --> 01:24:17,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's more about the community and the people for sure.

1151
01:24:17,268 --> 01:24:18,309
[SPEAKER_00]: But that

1152
01:24:18,789 --> 01:24:20,752
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a whole other podcast.

1153
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:29,584
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, let's talk about, hey, we're talking about, you know, unfortunately, too many cancelled games and maybe a game that should have been cancelled here, Skull & Bones.

1154
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:34,030
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about a classic cancelled game in this next segment.

1155
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,252
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll run the bumper right now.

1156
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:53,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1157
01:24:53,637 --> 01:24:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1158
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:04,702
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, DarkSakura, once a month here at Orange Lounge Radio, you actually pick a little twist.

1159
01:25:04,702 --> 01:25:07,683
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually do a classic cancelled game.

1160
01:25:07,683 --> 01:25:10,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this month's classic cancelled game?

1161
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:17,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I did the classic, the legend, Thrillkill.

1162
01:25:17,342 --> 01:25:17,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.

1163
01:25:17,823 --> 01:25:31,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many people have remembered playing various builds of this game and various levels of completion off of some, you know, burned disc, you know?

1164
01:25:31,011 --> 01:25:31,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have.

1165
01:25:31,832 --> 01:25:39,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I think that most people, I would say.

1166
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:40,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1167
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:41,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So Thrillkill,

1168
01:25:42,814 --> 01:25:50,138
[SPEAKER_06]: was a fighting game that was developed by Paradox Development for the PlayStation.

1169
01:25:50,138 --> 01:26:08,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It was intended to be released in 1998 and the game's plot is about 10 people who get sent to hell after dying on Earth and are forced by Marutka, the goddess of secrets, to fight to the death, I guess the again death, for a chance at reincarnation.

1170
01:26:10,063 --> 01:26:18,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was marketed to be the first four-player 3D fighting game because you could play with the multi-tap.

1171
01:26:20,959 --> 01:26:31,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And each of the character has a kill meter that as you keep attacking, once it's filled up, you get a gory finisher move called a thrill kill.

1172
01:26:31,806 --> 01:26:45,756
[SPEAKER_06]: The game began life as a game called Earth Monster, which was a sport video game that was based off of a Mesoamerican ball game where you are

1173
01:26:46,937 --> 01:26:47,598
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1174
01:27:03,037 --> 01:27:15,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It basically got an AO rating and it was the, you know, first game to receive its rating like that for violence.

1175
01:27:15,405 --> 01:27:22,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But at any rate, the Thrill Kill was considered to be very fun.

1176
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:26,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in, you know, going back in beta, people really loved it.

1177
01:27:26,272 --> 01:27:29,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I played an early beta of it.

1178
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:45,061
[SPEAKER_06]: but then EA, it was actually going to be published by Virgin, Virgin Interactive, but then EA got the publishing rights and chose not to release it or sell it to other publishers because it was considered too graphic.

1179
01:27:45,908 --> 01:27:50,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that said, welcome to the internet.

1180
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:59,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were bootleg versions of the game going around on various pirating platforms and ROM releases.

1181
01:27:59,581 --> 01:28:06,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the game did live on in a

1182
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:10,113
[SPEAKER_06]: a different version of the game.

1183
01:28:10,113 --> 01:28:18,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released in 1999 as a re-skinned game called Wu-Tang Shaolin Style.

1184
01:28:18,003 --> 01:28:22,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It was developed by Paradox and they used Thrill Kill's engine to do it.

1185
01:28:22,889 --> 01:28:26,073
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they used Thrill Kill's engine in a few other games.

1186
01:28:27,394 --> 01:28:40,285
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, as it goes, you've got four opponents in a closed 3D room who have to fight each other with gory thrill kills and stuff.

1187
01:28:40,285 --> 01:28:47,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got four attack buttons, and each one corresponds to an arm and a leg.

1188
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:50,694
[SPEAKER_06]: If you stand still, you auto-block or hold down a guard button.

1189
01:28:52,254 --> 01:28:55,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Double tapping in the direction lets you dash.

1190
01:28:55,436 --> 01:29:01,639
[SPEAKER_06]: You have throws, including a swap throw, so you can switch places with another character.

1191
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:05,440
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a hold throw where you, you know, do like a lock or something.

1192
01:29:07,882 --> 01:29:12,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have a high and low counters instead of, you know, your life bar.

1193
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:33,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, you've got your kill meter and it increases with each successful attack and whoever hits that meter first has to use their thrill kill on another appointment of their choice which then removes them from the round and you're, you know, so basically whoever hits the most and kills the fastest, you know, ends up on top.

1194
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:35,003
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got different modes.

1195
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:43,073
[SPEAKER_06]: You have an arcade mode where you are a single player through 8 stages against computer controlled opponents.

1196
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:49,681
[SPEAKER_06]: The first 6 or 4 player matches and the latter 2 are 1 on 1 where you fight Judas and Maruka.

1197
01:29:52,384 --> 01:30:13,641
[SPEAKER_06]: the Versus where you can play with your friends, you can use the PlayStation MultiTap, there's a training mode for a single player to go against a computer opponent to learn the moves, and you can even do... if you perform each of their moves in this mode, you get a 5th costume to the character.

1198
01:30:19,644 --> 01:30:32,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Dante's Cage, The Crematorium, Sacrificial Ruins, Chamber of Anguish, The Lavatory, Insane Asylum, Slaughterhouse of the Flesh, Sewer of Sticks, Sinner's Cell, and Homicide Avenue.

1199
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:38,831
[SPEAKER_06]: So your characters, let's let's begin with the characters.

1200
01:30:38,831 --> 01:30:48,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have Bella Donna, who is a librarian who became a dominatrix and killed her husband and sister after discovering they were having an affair.

1201
01:30:48,418 --> 01:30:52,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And she died by electrocuting herself with a cattle prod.

1202
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,181
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.

1203
01:30:54,611 --> 01:30:55,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1204
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:59,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, these character descriptions, these are gold.

1205
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:06,497
[SPEAKER_06]: You have Cain, who is an arsonist who got trapped inside a building he set on fire and was burned alive.

1206
01:31:06,497 --> 01:31:11,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has very wide reaches and he farts fire.

1207
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:12,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1208
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:18,042
[SPEAKER_06]: You have Cletus, the cannibal who sold homestyle sausages made from people.

1209
01:31:18,042 --> 01:31:22,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And he died from a tapeworm infection from one of his victims.

1210
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:29,727
[SPEAKER_06]: He fights with a detached leg and can bite his opponents.

1211
01:31:29,727 --> 01:31:42,236
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Dr. Faustus, a plastic surgeon who killed and disfigured his patients and died from an infection after affixing a bear trap to his face.

1212
01:31:42,236 --> 01:31:45,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And he uses a scalpel and uses the bear trap as a mouth.

1213
01:31:47,059 --> 01:31:55,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have The Imp, who is a small person leather daddy who hates tall people.

1214
01:31:55,301 --> 01:32:03,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And he died after amputating his legs and instilling stilts instead.

1215
01:32:03,783 --> 01:32:07,464
[SPEAKER_06]: But he hasn't killed anybody during his time on Earth, and he uses the stilts as weapons.

1216
01:32:10,487 --> 01:32:16,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's Judas, who is the pair of conjoined twins connected at the torso.

1217
01:32:16,389 --> 01:32:19,410
[SPEAKER_06]: No one knows how they ended up in hell.

1218
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:23,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So depending on who's on top, one is the upper and one is the lower.

1219
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:31,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of their skins, for the record, looks like Ken and Ryu joined at the torso.

1220
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:32,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1221
01:32:32,295 --> 01:32:32,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1222
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:36,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to use that one.

1223
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:42,235
[SPEAKER_06]: There was Mammoth who was a postal employee who went postal after getting fired.

1224
01:32:42,235 --> 01:32:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And he looks like a large skinless gorilla.

1225
01:32:45,137 --> 01:32:51,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Maruka, the demon and goddess of secrets who fights and she can teleport.

1226
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:58,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Oddball is a FBI behavioral analyst who became a serial killer and still wears a straitjacket in hell and can't use his arms.

1227
01:32:58,527 --> 01:33:02,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So he kicks in headbutts and he breakdances.

1228
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:03,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, these are gold.

1229
01:33:04,522 --> 01:33:14,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Tormentor, a judge named William Whitefield who would acquit criminals in order to kidnap and torture them later and was eventually executed for his crimes.

1230
01:33:14,886 --> 01:33:19,067
[SPEAKER_06]: His outfit is bondage related and he uses a heated whip.

1231
01:33:19,067 --> 01:33:27,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Violet, a circus contortionist who developed a strong hatred for men after someone broke into her room and abused her.

1232
01:33:29,631 --> 01:33:32,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop using that as a plot point for women, by the way.

1233
01:33:32,772 --> 01:33:34,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Ugh, I'm gonna go.

1234
01:33:34,072 --> 01:33:40,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, she died of a spinal cord rupture, and she fights as a contortionist.

1235
01:33:40,894 --> 01:33:50,558
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a 12th non-player character who is called the Gimp, as in the one from Pulp Fiction.

1236
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:51,438
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a training opponent.

1237
01:33:52,697 --> 01:33:53,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1238
01:33:53,658 --> 01:33:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is, I mean, clearly problematic.

1239
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to say the minimum.

1240
01:34:00,163 --> 01:34:07,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And it, like I said, it got an AO rating, Adults Only rating, for its content.

1241
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:10,131
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very problematic.

1242
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:11,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was a fun game.

1243
01:34:11,492 --> 01:34:17,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, despite all of the problematic stuff, the game played well.

1244
01:34:17,597 --> 01:34:18,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know,

1245
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:30,459
[SPEAKER_06]: The game already even had, it was 99% done and had a sequel planned that was either going to be called S&M or FUBAR.

1246
01:34:30,459 --> 01:34:38,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for people who don't, who never have known what FUBAR means, it's for fucked up beyond all recognition.

1247
01:34:38,404 --> 01:34:42,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, they were,

1248
01:34:43,363 --> 01:34:45,304
[SPEAKER_06]: They had offers to buy it.

1249
01:34:45,304 --> 01:34:47,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Eidos wanted it.

1250
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:57,773
[SPEAKER_06]: But EA was trying to get over the industry stigma about being a violent medium and all of that.

1251
01:34:57,773 --> 01:35:00,054
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a big clusterfuck.

1252
01:35:00,054 --> 01:35:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And this also had to do with

1253
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:14,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we were supposed to say his name again, but maybe the Statue of Limitations has, you know, let off on that due to, I'll say, relevancy.

1254
01:35:14,854 --> 01:35:21,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was the Joe Lieberman connections to EA.

1255
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:23,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was him.

1256
01:35:23,641 --> 01:35:24,882
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking of Jack Thompson.

1257
01:35:24,882 --> 01:35:25,962
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that lawyer guy.

1258
01:35:25,962 --> 01:35:26,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I am.

1259
01:35:27,003 --> 01:35:32,985
[SPEAKER_06]: that I know Lieberman had been a big thing in there, but he was very opposed to video game violence.

1260
01:35:32,985 --> 01:35:34,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we call them Jack Voldemort for a while.

1261
01:35:34,946 --> 01:35:38,507
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we don't say that term either, because that all got tainted.

1262
01:35:38,507 --> 01:35:42,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goodness, everything that gets attached, call them all the tainted.

1263
01:35:42,668 --> 01:35:45,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Tainted, that's what it is.

1264
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:49,572
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, there were tons of bootleg copies that made it out.

1265
01:35:49,572 --> 01:35:55,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It was considered one of the most popular downloaded ROMs on the Internet, you know, into the late 90s and early 2000s.

1266
01:35:59,598 --> 01:36:06,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Hyde earlier said that the Thrill Kill engine was used in other games by Paradox?

1267
01:36:06,503 --> 01:36:18,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also used for X-Men Mutant Academy in 2000 and its sequel in 2001, X-Men Mutant Academy 2, and then Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena in 2000.

1268
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:33,756
[SPEAKER_06]: One reviewer described this game as perfect for mindless fun with friends and cold drinks.

1269
01:36:33,756 --> 01:36:35,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Mindless but not brainless.

1270
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:48,967
[SPEAKER_06]: There should be enough depth to this gameplay to satisfy the hardcore 3D fighting fans once Paradox has completed its final few months of dedicated beta tweaking.

1271
01:36:57,173 --> 01:37:06,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, GamePro put it on the list of 50 best fighting game characters ever in 2011 for, uh, you know, for some of the characters there.

1272
01:37:06,896 --> 01:37:13,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was, it's, it's a classic.

1273
01:37:13,018 --> 01:37:20,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and as far as I'm considered, because it was just so available, I, I,

1274
01:37:23,652 --> 01:37:28,154
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hard for me to even remember that this actually had been a cancelled game.

1275
01:37:28,154 --> 01:37:29,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was just everywhere.

1276
01:37:29,775 --> 01:37:38,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can buy, quote, commercial copies, like the 99% finished ones, with people having filled in the gaps and everything.

1277
01:37:38,799 --> 01:37:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, yeah, that's it.

1278
01:37:42,641 --> 01:37:43,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Thrill Kill.

1279
01:37:44,062 --> 01:37:52,606
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very interesting that, you know, this is a very good story of once it's on the internet, there's no stopping it, right?

1280
01:37:52,606 --> 01:37:56,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of fan projects to get cancelled by Nintendo and that sort of thing, right?

1281
01:37:56,727 --> 01:38:02,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that, you know, you don't announce those sort of things and tell the ROMs on the internet because at that point, well, there's no stopping it.

1282
01:38:02,029 --> 01:38:03,190
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere now.

1283
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:06,311
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very interesting early example of that, right?

1284
01:38:06,311 --> 01:38:08,512
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but to... Yeah, something like that.

1285
01:38:08,852 --> 01:38:10,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually knew very little about this game.

1286
01:38:10,794 --> 01:38:14,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew of it because I think you've brought it up on the show before.

1287
01:38:14,139 --> 01:38:17,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But I brought it over to your house to your apartment.

1288
01:38:17,062 --> 01:38:18,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally never remember playing this.

1289
01:38:18,884 --> 01:38:19,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

1290
01:38:19,325 --> 01:38:20,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't doubt that that's true.

1291
01:38:20,446 --> 01:38:24,331
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just one of those like, I don't remember it.

1292
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:27,475
[SPEAKER_00]: But now now that I'm seeing it again, I'm like, wow, it looks like garbage.

1293
01:38:29,176 --> 01:38:30,838
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS1 was not 100% polished.

1294
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,443
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was it played really solidly.

1295
01:38:51,443 --> 01:39:00,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I could see why they would want to have reused that engine for other games because it was it was a solid engine to boot.

1296
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:01,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1297
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:07,334
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we had a lot of fun playing playing the game, you know, and just going, Oh, look at that.

1298
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:10,196
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, being like five year olds pointing at the naughty bits.

1299
01:39:10,196 --> 01:39:10,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.

1300
01:39:11,537 --> 01:39:12,299
[SPEAKER_06]: TeeHee Bloods

1301
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:32,814
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, there it is your classic canceled game of the month and we will look forward to next month's canceled game.

1302
01:39:32,814 --> 01:39:36,096
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, unless, you know, the segment gets canceled.

1303
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:36,576
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't.

1304
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,957
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back next month with that.

1305
01:39:37,957 --> 01:39:46,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's travel around and check out some rapid fire news and some other quick headlines before we get to the listener roundtable here.

1306
01:39:46,483 --> 01:39:48,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start with Loki with a few quick headlines.

1307
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:54,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony is saying that the PlayStation 5 is entering the latter half of its life cycle.

1308
01:39:54,024 --> 01:39:58,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes, it's been out for a while, so that makes sense.

1309
01:39:58,267 --> 01:40:03,411
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like it, but only because I waited so long to buy one, because remember, you can't keep a party fine for forever, yeah.

1310
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:05,532
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1311
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:23,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding the PlayStation 5 hardware, which enters its fifth year since launch, partially due to it entering the latter half of the console cycle, we aim to optimize sales with a greater emphasis on balance with profits, so we anticipate a gradual decline in unit sales from the next fiscal year onwards.

1312
01:40:23,743 --> 01:40:30,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They may be selling less units, but they still want to be profitable, I guess, is what that means.

1313
01:40:30,187 --> 01:40:32,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, news that's important to me,

1314
01:40:33,317 --> 01:40:33,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Ale

1315
01:41:01,885 --> 01:41:15,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade1up had a leak that for the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet that they have X-Men 97 deluxe arcade art.

1316
01:41:15,332 --> 01:41:19,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be pretty neat.

1317
01:41:19,334 --> 01:41:24,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the image that was leaked for it.

1318
01:41:25,848 --> 01:41:28,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's like got all of those outfits.

1319
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:35,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got, you know, the the Jim Lee era costumes and whatnot.

1320
01:41:35,258 --> 01:41:37,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1321
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1322
01:41:38,601 --> 01:41:43,727
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm sure they're kind of kicking themselves about the leak, but I mean, it's artwork.

1323
01:41:43,727 --> 01:41:44,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.

1324
01:41:44,267 --> 01:41:44,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty neat.

1325
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:50,856
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people very excited about that X-Men 97 cartoon.

1326
01:41:50,856 --> 01:41:52,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I'd watch that, to be honest.

1327
01:41:52,538 --> 01:41:54,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember watching the old cartoon.

1328
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good times.

1329
01:41:57,404 --> 01:42:05,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, in Evercade news, which is a thing we're reporting on now, now that I guess I have a vested interest in this, but no, this does sound cool.

1330
01:42:05,748 --> 01:42:12,051
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have news of another cartridge that's going to be coming out for the Evercade that is coming out very soon.

1331
01:42:12,051 --> 01:42:24,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Sunsoft Collection 2, which will have Euphoria the Saga, Blaster Master, Enemy Below, that's the Game Boy one, Arrow the Acrobat 2, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, Days Before Christmas,

1332
01:42:25,517 --> 01:42:29,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Galaxy Fight, Universal Warriors, and Pre-Pre-Primitive Princess

1333
01:42:47,024 --> 01:42:48,705
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be fun to play.

1334
01:42:48,705 --> 01:42:50,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to get one of those.

1335
01:42:50,466 --> 01:42:52,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually looking at two they have.

1336
01:42:52,327 --> 01:42:55,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is.

1337
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:57,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, they have one.

1338
01:42:57,511 --> 01:43:02,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the Evercade, but it's it's similar to that.

1339
01:43:02,754 --> 01:43:05,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also plays Evercade cartridges.

1340
01:43:05,336 --> 01:43:07,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was.

1341
01:43:07,017 --> 01:43:09,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it looks like a Game Boy almost.

1342
01:43:09,939 --> 01:43:12,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Evercade's super popular.

1343
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:14,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Pocket is what it's called.

1344
01:43:14,663 --> 01:43:15,363
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.

1345
01:43:15,363 --> 01:43:17,785
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a like a desktop and a portable.

1346
01:43:17,785 --> 01:43:19,066
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different systems.

1347
01:43:19,066 --> 01:43:19,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1348
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:25,171
[SPEAKER_04]: But this they have the portal one that's kind of more of the form factor of like a PSP or something like that.

1349
01:43:25,171 --> 01:43:29,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is more of a form factor of like a Game Boy type of thing.

1350
01:43:29,714 --> 01:43:34,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's it's the Super Pocket is what it's called.

1351
01:43:34,097 --> 01:43:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks cool.

1352
01:43:35,338 --> 01:43:35,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1353
01:43:35,899 --> 01:43:38,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get some.

1354
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:38,921
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1355
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:48,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we have now a chance to travel the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming out in a game store near you.

1356
01:43:48,497 --> 01:43:50,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the US Loki.

1373
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:26,117
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I think that's the one based off the show, the CX.

1374
01:46:26,117 --> 01:46:27,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's that one.

1375

[SPEAKER_00]: So that's coming out of Japan as well.

1376

1383
01:46:59,262 --> 01:47:01,644

01:47:44,817 --> 01:47:51,041
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 27th for PlayStation and Xbox we have Warhammer Age of Sigmar Realms of Ruin.

1390
01:47:53,062 --> 01:48:02,087
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 29th we have Welcome to Paradise with a Z for Xbox and PlayStation and then for PlayStation we have Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

1391
01:48:05,868 --> 01:48:09,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we will get to our listener roundtable in just a moment.

1392
01:48:09,672 --> 01:48:11,534
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, we do have one more headline.

1393
01:48:11,534 --> 01:48:15,478
[SPEAKER_00]: I say unfortunately, because this is a little bit of shocking and sad news.

1394
01:48:15,478 --> 01:48:17,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki with our final headline tonight.

1395
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:23,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, unfortunately, Yoshitaka Murayama has passed away.

1396
01:48:23,606 --> 01:48:26,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was best known for, of course,

1397
01:48:30,072 --> 01:48:35,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Suikoden, and of course Iodine Chronicles 100 Heroes was the newest game.

1398
01:48:35,136 --> 01:48:38,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a spiritual successor that he had put together.

1399
01:48:38,618 --> 01:48:45,082
[SPEAKER_04]: He passed away at age of 55 from complications due to his illness.

1400
01:48:45,082 --> 01:48:48,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't really disclose much more about what the illness is.

1401
01:48:48,244 --> 01:48:50,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're trying to keep it pretty private, it sounds like.

1402
01:48:50,586 --> 01:48:50,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1403
01:48:51,687 --> 01:48:52,787
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still bad.

1404
01:48:52,787 --> 01:48:55,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very young, very sad.

1405
01:48:55,108 --> 01:49:01,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, also when you consider that Aiden Chronicles is coming out in like just a couple of months, I think it's an April release, if I remember right.

1406
01:49:01,809 --> 01:49:09,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really tragic that he didn't get a chance to see how the game ultimately ends up being received, which hopefully is pretty good.

1407
01:49:09,151 --> 01:49:11,212
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we won't know until we ultimately get our hands on it.

1408
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:20,814
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, or just the mere fact of getting to see Suikoden, you know, amongst all the Konami fuckery, get a second life of sorts.

1409
01:49:21,614 --> 01:49:24,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with this, you know, spiritual successor, it's, it's, it's a bummer.

1410
01:49:24,876 --> 01:49:25,876
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't get to see that.

1411
01:49:25,876 --> 01:49:27,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes this news very, very sad.

1412
01:49:27,937 --> 01:49:29,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of you in chat kind of echoing that.

1413
01:49:29,918 --> 01:49:34,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonds006 says, I saw the news of his passing earlier today on socials.

1414
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been making the rounds.

1415
01:49:35,181 --> 01:49:35,961
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually passed.

1416
01:49:35,961 --> 01:49:42,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say he passed on February 6th, but they withheld the news for about a week, probably because of like the privacy and all that stuff.

1417
01:49:42,544 --> 01:49:46,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, just still very shocking, very shocking and sad.

1418
01:49:47,742 --> 01:49:49,803
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1419
01:50:13,376 --> 01:50:14,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

1420
01:50:27,751 --> 01:50:29,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the listener roundtable.

1421
01:50:29,851 --> 01:50:34,672
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to invite your emails, your calls, your carrier pigeons.

1422
01:50:34,672 --> 01:50:38,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Participate at OrangeLingerie.com is the place where you can send an email.

1423
01:50:38,553 --> 01:50:45,755
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to call in tonight, visit our discord over at VOGNetwork.com slash discord and head over to our green room.

1424
01:50:45,755 --> 01:50:51,276
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe we have at least one email tonight, so I'm going to throw it over to DarkSakura.

1425
01:50:51,276 --> 01:50:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: We do indeed have the just one.

1426
01:50:55,937 --> 01:50:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: We have

1427
01:50:58,230 --> 01:51:06,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello LR!

1428
01:51:06,954 --> 01:51:11,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't help but comment on reactions last week to the news that new plastic instruments are coming.

1429
01:51:11,656 --> 01:51:14,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the reactions included Goodwill, Ozone, Landfill, and OK.

1430
01:51:16,156 --> 01:51:26,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Way, way back in 2015, when Rock Band 4 and Guitar Hero Live both launched, I believe they both arrived at least two to three years too early, and they needed to have waited longer to generate adequate demand.

1431
01:51:26,938 --> 01:51:28,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, I still believe that.

1432
01:51:28,298 --> 01:51:42,601
[SPEAKER_06]: We know today that sales of both titles did not meet expectations, but despite that, even now, there are still many devoted fans who continue to enjoy the Rock Band series of games, including many who enjoyed the series back in its heyday, but have not actually played Rock Band 4 yet.

1433
01:51:44,144 --> 01:51:48,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I was one of the folks that was thinking about trying Rock Band 4 on Xbox during the pandemic.

1434
01:51:48,632 --> 01:51:53,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I managed to get the software cheap, $10 for the disc, and of course I already had a USB microphone.

1435
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:56,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Next I needed the guitar, and here's where the problem begins.

1436
01:51:59,275 --> 01:52:06,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I have a wireless guitar hero controller as well as a wired rock band 1 guitar, both for Xbox 360.

1437
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:09,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, none of those work on modern Xbox consoles out of the gate.

1438
01:52:09,839 --> 01:52:11,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing they made adapters.

1439
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:13,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what do those adapters cost in 2024?

1440
01:52:15,641 --> 01:52:24,564
[SPEAKER_06]: The adapter that allows you to use wireless Xbox 360 peripherals and RockBand 4 is currently going between $250 and $300 by itself in used condition.

1441
01:52:24,564 --> 01:52:26,985
[SPEAKER_06]: The wired adapter can go up to $400.

1442
01:52:26,985 --> 01:52:30,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it, you might say, I'll just get the RockBand 4 guitar controllers.

1443
01:52:30,607 --> 01:52:35,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, those are starting around $200 used, and you want drums, that'll be at least $250 to $300 used, of course.

1444
01:52:37,526 --> 01:52:53,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true that music games through the last 20 plus years have often required people spending some serious money on controllers and accessories, especially the niche Japanese titles, but to even be able to play Rock Band 4 at all now is prohibitively expensive for most people.

1445
01:52:53,869 --> 01:52:59,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And now in 2024, PDP has announced the production of new Rock Band 4 guitar controllers.

1446
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:05,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Joke if you like, but this means that a number of folks, myself included, will not actually be able to play the game.

1447
01:53:05,456 --> 01:53:13,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if these new PDP guitars wind up costing over $100, that is still affordable to some folks when compared to some options right now.

1448
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention these controllers will be brand new and hopefully will have decent build quality.

1449
01:53:17,843 --> 01:53:20,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, as ridiculous as this may seem, it actually is important to some

1450
01:53:21,525 --> 01:53:24,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks, anyways, thanks as always for the show.

1451
01:53:24,449 --> 01:53:26,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's march toward a thousand to continue.

1452
01:53:26,832 --> 01:53:28,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock on OLR, Erin YYR.

1453
01:53:29,585 --> 01:53:35,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like, I understand how maybe our somewhat dismissive comments may have rubbed you the wrong way.

1454
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:41,214
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it because I know you're a music and music game fan at heart, you know, and we were big music game fans too.

1455
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:43,815
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, at the end of the day, here's what it is with peripherals.

1456
01:53:43,815 --> 01:53:50,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And why, you know, at least my comment was, you know, I think I'd said landfill or so I don't one of those words was mine.

1457
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,142
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it was the end.

1458
01:53:52,842 --> 01:54:10,251
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe yeah but but and here's why because in reality when those games were first out those controllers and things were everywhere and people were having rock band parties and you know it was all that good fun and stuff but then it's just kind of like that all kind of disappeared

1459
01:54:10,851 --> 01:54:18,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe not for you, but I'm talking about like on a large scale, you know, it's mass popularity kind of disappeared.

1460
01:54:18,493 --> 01:54:21,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those plastic instruments really feel like they're piling up.

1461
01:54:21,174 --> 01:54:28,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet a lot of people don't even know that they might be sitting on a gold mine in their garage or in their basement of how much those controllers are worth at this time.

1462
01:54:29,437 --> 01:54:38,107
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, I feel like, and I kind of hinted at this earlier in the show when I was talking about keyboards, I feel like if I were to pick one up, I would play it twice, I would be like, okay, that was cool.

1463
01:54:38,107 --> 01:54:39,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's done.

1464
01:54:39,269 --> 01:54:45,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think it would be a lot harder to find like a group of people who want to come together and do this thing in one place.

1465
01:54:45,196 --> 01:54:49,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, and this is the other very important part, that's not what Fortnite Festival is.

1466
01:54:50,535 --> 01:54:55,258
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, and I could be wrong, you can't play Fortnite Festival on one screen all in the same room.

1467
01:54:55,258 --> 01:55:00,562
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to be played with people across the internet in different places.

1468
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:05,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So by that nature, it's kind of like, well, they don't really see you with the controller.

1469
01:55:05,465 --> 01:55:10,569
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like a lot of it kind of loses its charm with Fortnite Festival.

1470
01:55:10,569 --> 01:55:11,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that, you know,

1471
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:18,772
[SPEAKER_00]: people have very rich rock band libraries and this will allow people to tap into that still and so forth.

1472
01:55:18,772 --> 01:55:25,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand all that but I just kind of wonder for the for most gamers.

1473
01:55:25,234 --> 01:55:27,455
[SPEAKER_00]: How long?

1474
01:55:27,455 --> 01:55:28,155
[SPEAKER_00]: How?

1475
01:55:28,155 --> 01:55:30,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the rain is really starting to come down outside.

1476
01:55:30,495 --> 01:55:31,956
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does that really last?

1477
01:55:33,223 --> 01:55:34,063
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

1478
01:55:34,063 --> 01:55:35,824
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad you know what, I'm glad for you.

1479
01:55:35,824 --> 01:55:41,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there are a lot of music game fans that really appreciate it and would use it on a regular basis.

1480
01:55:41,927 --> 01:55:43,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that reason, it's cool.

1481
01:55:43,647 --> 01:55:50,410
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just I say landfill because for the most part, I think most of those plastic instruments, people don't know the value of them.

1482
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:53,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they ended up.

1483
01:55:53,151 --> 01:55:56,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

1484
01:55:56,152 --> 01:55:57,413
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate the perspective.

1485
01:55:57,413 --> 01:55:59,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Every gamer has a voice.

1486
01:55:59,614 --> 01:55:59,854
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1487
01:56:00,765 --> 01:56:09,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you want to send us an email in a future week, perhaps you have a differing opinion than we do that say, okay, participate at orange laundry.com as long as you're civil and respectful about it.

1488
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:13,193
[SPEAKER_00]: We will hear those differing opinions for sure.

1489
01:56:13,193 --> 01:56:14,373
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1490
01:56:14,373 --> 01:56:17,335
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely some red cell rain coming down outside right now.

1491
01:56:17,335 --> 01:56:18,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the shower.

1492
01:56:18,996 --> 01:56:20,037
[SPEAKER_00]: That turned on outside.

1493
01:56:20,037 --> 01:56:20,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo.

1494
01:56:20,257 --> 01:56:22,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it hit your place?

1495
01:56:22,118 --> 01:56:24,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, I know you're a little Eastie here, so it probably hasn't hit you yet.

1496
01:56:24,899 --> 01:56:26,700
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, has it hit your place yet?

1497
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,300
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty loud.

1498
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:28,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't noticed.

1499
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:30,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I have noise canceling headphones on.

1500
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:31,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's probably why.

1501
01:56:31,983 --> 01:56:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell because someone's showering right now too.

1502
01:56:34,484 --> 01:56:35,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just sounds like water anyways.

1503
01:56:35,984 --> 01:56:38,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it wouldn't it takes you're a little east of me.

1504
01:56:38,225 --> 01:56:39,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably take some time to get over there.

1505
01:56:39,385 --> 01:56:40,166
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway.

1506
01:56:40,166 --> 01:56:41,426
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1507
01:56:41,426 --> 01:56:43,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I know smash the save button when the show ends for sure.

1508
01:56:43,967 --> 01:56:44,287
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.

1509
01:56:44,287 --> 01:56:49,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, luckily we are getting toward maybe unluckily, luckily we're getting towards the end of the show anyway.

1510
01:56:49,268 --> 01:56:51,409
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna wrap things up here.

1511
01:56:51,409 --> 01:56:54,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to call out and ask real quick, though, if Loki had any last minute stories.

1512
01:56:55,055 --> 01:57:02,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have one fun thing, and it is a fan-made remake of Zelda 2.

1513
01:57:02,317 --> 01:57:07,258
[SPEAKER_04]: They enhanced it with an enhanced second quest to it as well.

1514
01:57:07,258 --> 01:57:08,878
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been watching it today, actually.

1515
01:57:08,878 --> 01:57:10,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Did this come out?

1516
01:57:10,599 --> 01:57:19,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's available, it's on, so if you go to hoverbat.itch.io slash Z-I-I A-O-L

1517
01:57:20,454 --> 01:57:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda 2 Adventures of Link

1518
01:57:50,387 --> 01:57:51,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1519
01:58:12,233 --> 01:58:22,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other things that they've changed too as well, they've added, yeah, the creator added new areas, new puzzles, as well as introducing heart and magic containers throughout the world.

1520
01:58:22,099 --> 01:58:28,703
[SPEAKER_04]: They've also added one-ups that increase your permanent stock of lives even after you have to continue.

1521
01:58:28,703 --> 01:58:31,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's better checkpoints as well.

1522
01:58:31,185 --> 01:58:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's nice.

1523
01:58:34,744 --> 01:58:40,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and some of the magic has changed names.

1524
01:58:40,168 --> 01:58:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I think it's very well done.

1525
01:58:43,029 --> 01:58:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely worth it.

1526
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:48,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's still not my favorite game, so I'm not gonna play it.

1527
01:58:48,013 --> 01:58:53,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never liked the style for Zelda 2, but if you are a fan of it, absolutely go get it.

1528
01:58:53,786 --> 01:58:57,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I liked it when I was younger, but it's it's aged.

1529
01:58:57,128 --> 01:59:00,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, I don't know how else to put it.

1530
01:59:00,931 --> 01:59:01,731
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1531
01:59:01,731 --> 01:59:03,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with that, we're about towards the end of the show.

1532
01:59:03,973 --> 01:59:08,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a chance for us to wrap it all up and say, we're going to see you in two weeks.

1533
01:59:08,936 --> 01:59:11,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminder, we will not be here next week, but we will be back in two weeks.

1534
01:59:11,698 --> 01:59:16,541
[SPEAKER_00]: But stay tuned to our personal streams and our personal feeds, because it sounds like we might be cooking something up.

1535
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:21,645
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like Loki might have something on Saturday and the Dark Sakura could be doing something over here on Sunday.

1536
01:59:21,645 --> 01:59:23,726
[SPEAKER_00]: But stay tuned to the local feed.

1537
01:59:23,826 --> 01:59:26,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking out our show!

1538
01:59:45,055 --> 01:59:47,137
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1539
01:59:58,494 --> 02:00:04,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some issues with the weather as well, with being able to stay online.

1540
02:00:04,917 --> 02:00:13,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's been affecting the GeForce thing weird, and honestly, I need to take some me time to take care of some stuff tonight.

1541
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

1542
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:22,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as a result, I'm not going to stream, but I do have a deserving target in mind.

1543
02:00:22,043 --> 02:00:23,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

1544
02:00:23,504 --> 02:00:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, do you have a final thought for us tonight before we wrap up?

1545
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:31,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Fact check all the things.

1546
02:00:31,143 --> 02:00:33,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't believe what you read on the Internet.

1547
02:00:33,465 --> 02:00:38,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Fact check all the fucking things.

1548
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:39,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, with that, I'll go to you.

1549
02:00:39,412 --> 02:00:41,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Your final thought tonight.

1550
02:00:41,514 --> 02:00:47,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just hopefully going to be working hard on getting more content out for my YouTube show.

1551
02:00:49,271 --> 02:00:59,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and for me, I just, I'm, I'm looking forward to as what Enya sung in a particular song of hers, sail away, sail away, sail away.

1552
02:00:59,238 --> 02:01:00,659
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I want to do right now.

1553
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:02,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will see everybody in two weeks.

1554
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to it.

1555
02:01:03,921 --> 02:01:06,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you all have some happy gaming and some happy times.

1556
02:01:06,483 --> 02:01:08,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

1557
02:01:08,624 --> 02:01:09,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you are going to be playing that.

1558
02:01:09,985 --> 02:01:15,969
[SPEAKER_00]: That's out in two weeks, but whatever it is that you're playing, we hope you have a fantastic couple of weeks and we will see you next time.

1559
02:01:15,969 --> 02:01:17,009
