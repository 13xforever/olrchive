9716	14857	Last week, I complained to myself that it's early 2024 and things are being announced that won't be out until 2025.
14857	17258	This week, we got announcements of things that won't be out until 2026.
17258	23819	Then again, I am $225 and a Star Citizen and I'm still waiting on Squadron 42, so who am I to gauge time accurately?
23819	27740	Just for the record, my last Star Citizen purchase was in 2014 and I will pledge no more.
27740	34601	On this Mario day, it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, coming to you at a different hour, yet the same hour, to tell you about this week's gaming news.
34601	36662	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39093	52691	hello my friends out there on the internet welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is orange lounge radio we are live tonight on march the 10th of 2024 with episode number 995 of our program
56816	69903	Thank you all so much for being here, whether you are listening to us live on this Sunday night, as we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
69903	71184	So thank you to the live folks.
71184	72305	And thank you, of course, to those
72665	78910	that listen to us on the podcast feed throughout the week, including iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is that you find your podcasts.
78910	81372	Actually, I will point this out.
81372	87676	With the latest iOS update, iTunes now put the transcriptions in the podcast app.
87676	92820	So that's kind of a fun little thing and something folks have been asking us for for quite some time.
92820	99065	But, you know, it used to be something that was done with people listening and they charge a lot of money for it.
99065	99305	So it was
99485	101266	Rob Roberts, DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers
126573	131818	Hi, I'm unsubscribing from spam in our mailbox.
131818	148054	I'm always convinced, and maybe this is just tinfoil hat, maybe these are the conspiracy theories I learned from my pod daddy, Travis Donovan, but I am convinced that when you unsubscribe for spam, you're just telling them there's a real person looking here, send more spam on different topics.
149002	150222	No, it's a legal thing.
150222	159805	They actually are now... It's a legal requirement that when you unsubscribe for any service, they have to remove you from their list.
159805	161945	It's the same when someone calls you.
161945	170007	If you answer the phone and tell them, do not remove me from your list, they have to remove you from theirs and any other list by their company.
170007	173548	Don't matter if the spam's coming from offshore.
173548	175249	Just tinfoil hat.
176567	179709	Yeah, laws don't matter to the lawless.
179709	182591	But that's not how it works.
182591	183372	All right.
183372	184052	Well, good luck.
184052	186594	Good luck clearing out all the spam.
186594	188576	I wish you well.
188576	193980	Speaking of the criminals, I notice Loki is joining us tonight.
193980	195901	Loki's not a criminal.
195901	196641	But hi, Loki.
196641	197082	How are you?
197082	198183	Maybe a smooth criminal.
199600	199980	Red Vs. Blue
214793	218676	the biggest criminal in the entire industry of both movies and games.
218676	220178	This we'll get into later this week.
220178	223901	I actually, uh, unfortunately closed rooster teeth this week.
223901	224321	Am I not?
224321	228705	And of course I am referring to the one and only, uh, count Zaslav over it.
228705	234550	I don't know why I'm calling him count Zaslav, but I feel like that just makes him like implied that he's criminal.
234550	239695	Uh, and, uh, where are we going to get our, our, our headlight fuel or headlight oil?
240754	241654	It's disappointing.
241654	242575	It's upsetting.
242575	243635	It's infuriating.
243635	244935	I guess we'll get into that more later.
244935	247136	But how are you doing, Loki?
247136	247756	I'm okay.
247756	248357	I'm tired.
248357	249237	Yeah, tired.
249237	251258	Is that is it all the daylight savings?
251258	252058	Did you?
252058	252378	Are you?
252378	253639	Are you sad to have lost an hour?
253639	258960	I mean, daylight savings time did not stop me from sleeping in until 1130 today.
258960	259721	A little bit.
259721	260681	I mean, sure.
260681	262442	There's like some getting used to that.
262442	265423	I think it's just been a stressful week.
265423	268384	So it's just as I don't know.
268384	269024	It's everything.
269517	273739	Well, a great way to de-stress is to play some video games.
273739	275840	So we'll get into some gaming news.
275840	278081	I'm looking in chat at some of the comments.
278081	280102	Mike Defton chat says Count Zaslav.
280102	282243	I like it, but that's also too good for him.
282243	287885	It's because you're associating it with Count Chocula, which is, which is a great thing, which I understand, which I understand.
287885	288746	Maybe it is.
288746	290687	I said Zaslav, Hag of the Swamp.
290687	293908	I saw that Zaslav, Hag of the Swamp is a pretty good one too.
293908	295169	That's, that's a good one.
295169	295789	Yeah.
295789	296089	Okay.
296089	297410	Now they're saying Count Ducula.
297850	302012	the count from Sesame Street fine cheese.
302012	311837	I love this gold star comment from quest buster in response to the count from Sesame Street 123 tax breaks.
311837	316419	Ah, thanks.
316419	316879	I hate it.
318382	330010	Yeah, I mean, we're to a point now where they will remove games off of a service because they just don't want to pay the royalties on that for any sales.
330010	331731	Like, it's just bad.
331731	336714	Well, and so that they can claim a loss that will certainly be much greater than how do you claim a loss?
336714	340197	Like, assuming that that's why they're taking these games offline?
340197	342298	How do you claim a loss for a game that came out like
342788	343128	March 10, 2021
360117	366402	And there's absolutely nothing on TV to be watching right now, which is why I'm extra thankful that you all are here joining our program.
366402	371506	But of course, March 10th, I'm sure you've seen this somewhere on social media today.
371506	374448	You abbreviate that to Mar as March usually is Mar 10.
374448	376850	That's Mario.
376850	378591	It's so it's Mario Day.
378591	382734	And so, which it's just Mario Day because it says Mar 10.
382734	383135	It's not like
383815	388898	an actual anniversary of any of the games or I think Mario's like May the 4th.
388898	389458	Yeah, yes.
389458	392720	It's a made up holiday like May the 4th.
392720	394641	Revenge of the Sith.
394641	395542	Whatever.
395542	400325	So yeah, there's there's all these made up holidays and nerd culture.
400325	406288	And this is I think isn't January 17th another one for Star Trek?
406288	409130	There's something I don't I say because you flip it around at 1701.
411411	417718	I just have a better use for May the 4th instead, or for the 4th, and it's...
418960	424621	Oh, it's a sticker I have of a ballerina in fourth position with lightsabers.
424621	427522	And it says, May the fourth be with you.
427522	428882	Bobby Blackwell points out November 7.
428882	429122	Yep.
429122	429962	No.
429962	434804	And seven day it's it's first contract first contact day that all the Star Trek nerds celebrate.
434804	435244	I forgot.
435244	436864	That's, that's the one.
436864	445906	Anyway, but we're gonna talk about Mario Day because Nintendo actually joining in the festivities this year, which is a little unexpected on a Sunday, right, Loki?
447421	448563	I mean, I don't know.
448563	449584	They make announcements.
449584	453470	No, we don't usually see press releases on a Sunday or directs and things like that, so it's...
454363	456083	I mean, yeah, sure.
456083	459344	So we got a few different announcements regarding that.
459344	470167	There's some further news regarding the collaboration between Nintendo and Lego with their Mario sets that they've been doing for the last few years.
470167	479029	Now they're going to be doing a Mario Kart set that's going to be coming out in 2025, or at least they're going to kind of spin it off into that.
479029	480910	So curious to see what that is.
483169	484670	Mario sets are okay.
484670	495675	Like honestly, like I kind of wish they were more just like display pieces versus trying to make this all a game because it just doesn't work very well.
495675	503239	Well, you might you might get your wish with the Mario Kart set because I'm not sure I can actually turn that into a game that's playable very easy anyway.
503239	508862	We've already seen the you know, we had the what the AR Mario Kart game with the actual cars.
509102	509622	Rainbow Road Legos
532489	533351	Thank you for watching!
545897	553661	Mario Day announced that, yes, to no shock whatsoever, there is a sequel to the Super Mario Bros.
553661	555542	movie coming out in April 2026.
555542	557203	Wow!
557203	558864	I'm so shocked!
558864	563547	A new animated movie for their very popular animated movie.
563547	564327	Who would have thought?
564327	566048	How much money did that movie make?
567076	567696	BOTS
582842	584163	Looking forward to the sequel.
584163	587004	I hope they bring in the Koopalings and Bowser Jr.
587004	589105	That could be really cool way to go with it.
589105	599408	I would assume Wario would be a very obvious, you know, I'm sure, you know, and maybe people go, but Bowser and Wario in the same movie?
599408	604230	Sure, if they can put Penguin and Catwoman in the same movie, they can put Bowser and Wario in the same movie.
604230	605911	And yeah, Bowser will be back.
605911	608192	Let's just do Super Mario RPG the movie.
609648	610328	I love it.
610328	611229	That would be great.
611229	615190	But I think I think if they truly are trying to create the cinema, you know who won't be in it?
615190	617671	Donkey Kong because Donkey Kong will get his own movie.
617671	623774	Because if they're truly trying to create this cinematic universe, well, Donkey Kong is on land here pretty soon.
623774	626355	So yeah, yeah, that's what they're building out in Florida.
626355	626755	And I think
627375	628616	Is Japan further along?
628616	629937	I think.
629937	635702	Did you see the testing about how they're showing the test where the car actually jumps the track?
635702	645170	And it's this whole optical illusion they build by the real track is underneath and it's not so like the car is like way high up from this underneath rail.
645170	648913	And so it just looks like it's on the rail right in front of you.
648913	654958	And then when you do the hopping of the tracks, like it just like it makes your brain think you're actually flying, but it's all
655478	656579	DJ Ranma S is hoping for more Daisy
679755	681137	there's a lot of things they could do with it.
681137	683540	So I think the real speculation is where they get to go with it.
683540	693894	That'll be interesting to see what additional voice acting they confirm for the movie because you know, all the originals that they locked the originals in for a trilogy.
693894	697459	So however you feel about Chris Pratt, Jack Black,
698525	700366	I'm fine with Chris Pratt.
700366	702206	They're coming back for a trilogy.
702206	703807	Like, honestly, it didn't take me out of it.
703807	705567	I'm not fine with him as a person.
705567	713030	I'm sure, but, like, I'm talking about, like, as far as the voice acting goes, like... The movie's more than one person, so... That's fine.
713030	716211	Yeah.
716211	720092	So, yeah, and then Keegan-Michael Key is toad, though, absolutely.
720092	723093	So, yeah, the whole, the whole, um, the whole cast
724495	727718	did a fine job with the Mario movie and I'm sure the sequel will be fine.
727718	733364	It's just it's going to be interesting to see who does play Wario or who does play the Koopalings.
733364	737748	You know, depending on those are the additional cast announcements I'll be very curious about.
737748	740130	Who does Charles Martinet get to cameo as?
740130	742092	Because I bet they have him cameo again.
742092	743514	I think they I think they have to.
743514	745956	I think that would be a great little tradition to keep going.
745956	747357	It can be Wario.
749099	750521	I don't know if they go that far.
750521	755448	I feel like Wario is a is a prime opportunity to do a stunt casting.
755448	756629	Like I don't know who are like the
757802	779600	you have to forgive me I finally okay look I'm so behind on Hollywood I finally saw the Barbie movie on the flight to the cruise so I was literally like nine months late to the Barbie movie which was great I loved it it was it was really like I just my favorite part of the entire movie I'm sorry to tangent but I'm also not sorry this is Orange Launch Radio
780646	789948	My favorite part of the entire movie was the very beginning, the Lizzo song that's singing about what's going on, and then after she has that whole moment of like, do you all ever think about death?
789948	801371	Then the song plays up again, and the lyrics have all changed in the background, and it's like, it goes, I, insecurity, N, I'm scared.
801371	802551	I don't remember what they all say.
802551	804032	K, death.
804032	805132	She changed the lyrics.
805132	806972	It's the funniest thing in the whole movie.
806972	807513	So anyway.
809213	811494	PodCulture says, I need to watch that.
811494	815515	It has Kuri Gatwa in it.
815515	821817	Yes, he's, he is in it, but he's, I would relegate his role more to a cameo.
821817	829499	They have so many people in that movie, that a lot of them are relegated to more like cameo status.
829499	832680	So, but he did fine in it for the minimal part.
835069	837371	Alright, anyway, what else?
837371	837911	Sorry.
837911	838332	What else?
838332	841594	So we've got a couple of release date announcements.
841594	854665	So the remasters of Paper Mario, the Thousand Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 will be coming out here in the second quarter.
854665	862051	So we've got Thousand Year Door coming out May 23rd and Luigi's Mansion 2 coming June 27th.
865097	867561	Cool, more remakes or remasters, I guess.
880439	888547	to like extend a game every month to kind of keep the Switch going, so to speak.
888547	899298	So it's interesting, especially with all the talk about a Switch successor and has it been delayed to 2025, I think you're starting to see Nintendo lay down, like they're putting down more bricks
899758	903879	that are going to go through the holiday this year like one game a month through the holiday.
903879	909741	So I think these and there's going to be a lot of re releases and remasters because these are the things they're going to come up with quickly.
909741	918124	So yeah, I think this is just them laying the road till we do get the switch successor, which apparently is going to be next year.
918124	918604	Now.
918604	923486	I think this just kind of lends itself to that is happening.
923486	924806	The delay.
924806	924966	Yeah.
926943	933450	And then we had news that finally Nintendo Switch Online has added some more Game Boy games.
933450	937114	So those are available actually this week on the 12th.
937114	940998	And we'll be getting Dr. Mario, Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis for the Game Boy.
943820	946681	which are all extremely subpar.
946681	954104	I mean, Dr. Mario is fine, but we already have the NES version of that, which you don't really need the Game Boy version with that.
954104	962307	I mean, sure, from a preservation, completionist sort of perspective, okay, great, yay, polite applause.
962307	966668	But this, otherwise this news is nothing to scream about, to be honest.
966668	968109	Yeah.
968109	971230	It's nice to see that they're still adding things to the library, I suppose.
974027	988738	Ssj100 Matt points out the 40th anniversary of Mario Brothers is next year so yeah there's going to be plenty of Mario which you know what if they do release a new Nintendo successor next year
990226	1001555	And if the rumors are true that a new 3D Mario is going to be the game that is bundled with it, I would be very confident in the Nintendo is going to take advantage of that anniversary.
1001555	1016406	And, you know, say a new Mario game for the 40th anniversary of Mario and, you know, maybe something to highlight the back catalog as well in a similar way that they've done with Super Mario All Stars, the 3D All Stars that they did.
1016406	1019829	I mean, I don't I don't know what other like catalog, but maybe maybe just
1020929	1025670	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1047196	1053779	I played some Dead by Daylight, and I played Avatar, and that's pretty much it.
1053779	1065585	I probably have played a lot more of Avatar than I probably should have, but it's been a weird week, so I've pretty much stayed limited to that.
1065585	1067766	I did catch a little bit of your stream last night at Avatar.
1069119	1070220	Isn't it pretty?
1070220	1071261	It looks interesting.
1071261	1075205	Yeah, it's it's uh, yeah, I was more curious like what it would look like visually.
1075205	1076346	I was surprised though.
1076346	1077807	I'm gonna be honest.
1077807	1081731	I you you used to really not be into the first person stuff.
1081731	1085654	So I was kind of surprised that you were playing a first person game, but it is pretty.
1085654	1087356	That's why I put off starting it.
1087356	1091760	But once I did, it's actually a lot smoother than I thought it was gonna be.
1091760	1094242	Because there's other things to break it up.
1095203	1101846	And there's, like, it gets kind of bad in some of the combat, or, like, in the climbing.
1101846	1112750	I sometimes have it riding the Ikran, just because, like, it can bank really weird, or it can dive too fast.
1112750	1114071	I might misjudge things.
1114071	1119953	So I do, it's not that I, it's perfect, but it hasn't given me bad motion sickness.
1122179	1130437	So it's nothing I would want to do VR, but I'm enjoying what I'm doing.
1131411	1132551	Great.
1132551	1134612	Video games should be fun.
1134612	1149556	Well, and on top of that, I just love how well incorporated the the timing system, because you go through a full cycle of day and night and everything, and how like as it starts getting dusk, you start seeing the faint glow.
1149556	1157659	If you go into caves, the bioluminescence of the the plants inside comes up and you can see where you're going.
1158980	1163470	And at night, it is day glow neon madness.
1163470	1165494	It is absolutely gorgeous.
1165494	1166636	It feels magical.
1166636	1169763	It feels like certain rooms at Omega Mart.
1173798	1175979	It's really fun.
1175979	1182541	And for me, you know, I'm a lore nerd and I like artificial sociology, I guess is how I would say it.
1182541	1188343	You know, created languages, created environments, cultures, that type of thing.
1188343	1194686	I like to see if I can understand where they got ideas for certain things from or
1195686	1207910	or Howl, you know, just so for me, it's a lot more mentally stimulating than just run around, shoot thing, run around, gather berry, run around, make arrow.
1207910	1209451	But I love to run around and gather berry.
1209451	1210771	That's what I do in MMOs.
1210771	1214212	I can do all of that and be cerebral at the same time.
1214212	1220334	Or if my brain is just like, then I can just go around and file my big dinosaur.
1220334	1222515	That's definitely my brain when I play a lot of MMOs.
1224440	1237384	Well, one thing I like, too, is that you can get this skill with your Ikran, where if your stamina starts getting low, you can dive by water and skim like a lake or something, and they'll catch fish.
1237384	1238284	And you comment on it.
1238284	1239765	Was that yummy?
1239765	1240745	You know, something like that.
1240745	1245786	You can pet your Ikran until they fall asleep.
1245786	1247487	It's not just you loving Avatar.
1247487	1250868	Mishkins in chat says, I'm addicted, in caps, to Avatar.
1250868	1251888	It is just so gorgeous.
1251888	1254189	And I get an Abahom vibe from the lore and the language.
1256449	1262692	Michi was funny last night.
1262692	1265474	Cause he's like, all right, I'm going to lurk.
1265474	1267295	So I'll get spoiled.
1267295	1268235	10 minutes later.
1268235	1272857	What's that?
1272857	1274818	And then, you know, I'm over here.
1274818	1278180	I've, I've guessed though, like the twist in the game.
1278180	1279521	So it was pretty funny.
1279521	1282562	I was like, Ooh, I bet he did something.
1282562	1284463	And then he's like, I did the thing.
1284463	1285064	You caught me.
1285064	1285844	And I'm like, told you.
1286929	1287490	All right.
1287490	1288991	All right.
1288991	1294376	Questmaster says this is a sandbox fan Frontiers of Pandora is definitely on my list my ever growing list.
1294376	1295737	That is a full mood.
1295737	1297018	Prioritize it.
1297018	1298579	The backlog ever grows.
1298579	1299580	All right.
1299580	1300901	Well, let's go over to Techmaster Loki.
1300901	1303564	Loki, what have you prioritized for your gaming week?
1303564	1304945	I prioritize
1305723	1306123	Editing
1326357	1345785	Yeah, so I played that with Peep a bit and so that was fun to get to go up against they have like two factions now there's like robots that kind of like basically the Terminator and then bugs which are basically you know the creatures from Starship Troopers so
1346725	1355370	It's it I gotta ask a ridiculous question because remember I was out of town on break when this whole thing kind of, you know, got really big, so to speak.
1355370	1356991	Helldiver, what kind of game even is it?
1356991	1357992	Like, what is the game?
1357992	1358792	The shooty game?
1358792	1359233	Is it?
1359233	1360393	Yeah, it's a third person shooter.
1360393	1364876	So essentially, you're going to different locations.
1364876	1369799	So you drop down to a map and you have different objectives that you do in there.
1369799	1371200	So it may be that
1371801	1395916	your primary objective is to destroy this one thing and so you destroy that thing and you have to get back to your extract point but there's also like other bonus objectives you can do and it scales up in difficulty as you pick harder missions and stuff and essentially you have different like patrols that are going around and you have to defend yourself against you know
1396756	1406025	Lots of enemies that are coming and utilize your different drops that you can do to call things down from the sky and stuff like that.
1406025	1406986	It's pretty cool.
1406986	1409388	Mike Defton chat says third person tactical shooter.
1409388	1411511	It's Starship Troopers the game, which quest?
1411511	1416275	Yeah, essentially, yes, essentially Starship Troopers the game and death says it gets harder.
1416275	1417456	So that's okay.
1417456	1417817	That's it.
1417817	1419939	Yeah, yeah, it does definitely get harder.
1420427	1437493	I'm trying to remember what that game is I played recently that was it was kind of like that I felt like you were doing like aliens and stuff but it had a very Dark Souls vibe to it but you could play it with friends it was very difficult for me that's why I didn't get very far with it because it was it was very difficult so the sequel just came out not that long ago
1438837	1439637	Dang it, why can't I remember?
1439637	1441077	I've been playing it on Game Pass.
1441077	1445178	Somebody, somebody in chat will remember what this is.
1445178	1445859	I can't remember the name.
1445859	1448999	It's called the game Rob can't remember the name of, but he can see it clearly in his mind.
1448999	1450419	I know, my lovely memory.
1450419	1452300	I didn't play it very much because I wasn't good at it.
1452300	1454380	And it was like, my friend was very big on it.
1454380	1457521	And I tried to get into it, you know, to like have something to play with my friend.
1457521	1461182	But I just kept getting like, it was very difficult.
1461182	1466483	So but it was it had more of a like Dark Souls vibe to it because you know, a lot of games want to go that direction.
1466483	1466643	So
1467065	1474727	Now, this is very much, like, very much heavily inspired by Starship Troopers, like immensely.
1474727	1481249	And just even the the presentation of it is very much Starship Troopers.
1481249	1483090	Remnant, that's the game, Remnant.
1483650	1484230	Remnant?
1484230	1484571	Okay.
1484571	1487632	Yeah, it's very, very over the top.
1487632	1490473	It's also only a $40 game, which is kind of nice.
1490473	1500538	So it is still early in its development and they're adding like more stuff to it as time goes on.
1500538	1506501	Plus, there's different things that unlock, like they just unlocked these like mech suits that you can get now.
1506501	1511443	And it was a contingent on liberating like a certain amount of the plants and stuff.
1511443	1512804	Because as you play the game, you're also
1513504	1526409	working with all the other players to try to, you know, basically wipe out the resistance of either the automatons or the insects on these planets.
1526409	1529730	And then you get stuff for that.
1529730	1530450	Sounds interesting.
1530450	1531851	I'll have to check that out at some point.
1531851	1533871	It seems to be all the rage right now.
1533871	1534832	It's very cool.
1534832	1538993	Just like, yeah, definitely check out the like even this the intro video.
1538993	1540834	It's extremely Starship Troopers.
1541431	1545996	All right, I'm doing my part.
1545996	1547979	That gif is why I remember from that.
1547979	1548780	All right.
1548780	1550161	Well, there's a lot I remember from that.
1550161	1552924	But specifically, there's that.
1552924	1556629	Let's see other my game a week.
1556629	1558631	A lot of the same stuff I've been playing.
1558631	1559212	Not a lot new.
1559212	1560974	I'm catching up on on these.
1561454	1563495	Seasonal type of things.
1563495	1567757	So like Diablo 4, I've been really going hard on this latest season.
1567757	1569878	I think it's growing on me, but not the season.
1569878	1572499	I still don't don't like the season mechanic, but I do.
1572499	1580403	Well, I like the little pet that you get, the little construct and like how changing their abilities can kind of change what you're doing.
1580403	1588027	But again, I can't stand how much is based around the the trap layers or whatever they call the vaults.
1588427	1590991	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1604871	1632468	Battle Pass tier 35 or something and I'm level 50 no I'm level 60 now level 61 or something like that so I've been been playing that quite a bit still playing Final Fantasy 14 as well eagerly awaiting the Dawn Trail expansion trying to get all of my characters to 90 in their respective classes my Black Mage is 88 and my Dark Knight is 89 so I have like two classes very very close to being level 90 that I can add to the list and I think I only have like four more after that so
1633588	1636910	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out Diablo 4 is coming to Game Pass this month.
1636910	1637510	Yes, it is.
1637510	1643093	And it'll be nice to kind of have that infusion of players into the mix.
1643093	1648836	Because here's the thing, and I realize not everybody is into the end game stuff in Diablo, and that's fine.
1648836	1656180	I really do think the Diablo base experience, the base game, with the whole main story with Lilith, is absolutely worth playing.
1656180	1661423	Like, whether you want to keep going from there, I think that just depends on what you like as a gamer.
1661983	1662945	Thanks for watching!
1672126	1673167	So yeah, that, Final Fantasy XIV.
1673167	1686332	And then the other one that I've been playing is a game I've talked a lot about, No Man's Sky, but what makes it different this time is that there is the twelfth expedition that started in the game before I went on the cruise, and I think I have seven days left to finish it.
1686332	1692435	I'm through the first two parts of five, so I did a stream of that game, I think, on Monday.
1692435	1697257	And then, yeah, so I don't have a whole lot of time left to finish, but I'm gonna hope I can get a little more done.
1697697	1721484	I will say I did not find the expedition so far anyway to be super challenging and it's been a really good way to kind of get the leg up like what it walks you through is it's build a very nice base and I'm going to give you a ton of base parts to help you do it and you know jump to an atlas thing jump to and all these things you have to do is a core part of the story this expedition has felt very much like a jump start to the game
1721964	1724606	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1743365	1761820	Unless they're trying to create a scarcity thing, which I think is silly, unless they have something planned, usually based on track record, they don't, it'll go five weeks, the expedition will end and then we'll have a drive for five weeks until the next patch, which hey, we're lucky the game is getting this support six, seven years after its release as it is.
1761820	1769806	So it's not really a complaint, but just just let the expeditions last as long as you know, they need to not everybody can just like rush in there and play them.
1769806	1770747	So that's all.
1772247	1773850	So we'll see if I beat it or not.
1773850	1778379	I wanted to stream all of my progress, but I just don't think that's going to be possible.
1778379	1781746	I might do some tonight.
1781746	1782147	We'll see.
1782147	1783329	It just kind of depends what's going on.
1785046	1787127	Alright, that's it for my gaming week.
1787127	1793528	So usually I would tell you guys about any upcoming shows off or things to note.
1793528	1799810	I guess the only thing I would note is that tonight is episode number 995 of our show.
1799810	1807772	So if you look at a calendar, that means episode number 1000 of this program will be April 14.
1809184	1815481	So for those that are taking notes, episode 1000, the first weekly gaming podcast to hit 1000 episodes.
1817253	1820234	April 14 and very right before my birthday.
1820234	1820815	Very excited.
1820815	1824996	Well, what a birthday gift coming up.
1824996	1826877	And yeah, we're just excited about it.
1826877	1829718	I don't don't expect a lot of stunts.
1829718	1834100	Because, you know, after we've been doing this for 22 years, we're a little bit stunted out.
1834100	1838482	But I would love to have some old faces come back and visit us on the show.
1838482	1840323	And we have some we have some cute things planned.
1840323	1842984	So but don't set the bar too high.
1844423	1852424	It'll be another week in gaming news that we talk about in the patentedly way that we do every week.
1852424	1854325	So there's that.
1854325	1856885	Def says episode 1000 will be April 14.
1856885	1858045	Knocks on wood.
1858045	1859586	No, it will be April 14.
1859586	1866687	If we have to miss a show, we're going to make up the show midweek because DarkSakura is going to be out the next week for her birthday trip.
1866687	1867687	I'm going.
1867687	1869847	Yeah, yeah, doing my birthday thing.
1869847	1871188	So it has to be April 14.
1871188	1871268	So
1873206	1874267	That's that.
1874267	1875029	All right.
1875029	1877872	Um, yeah, Bobby Blackwell says getting the ladder out to set the bar.
1877872	1878593	Yeah, exactly.
1878593	1879294	Right.
1879294	1880055	All right.
1880055	1882298	Let's get into some gaming news.
1882298	1886344	And we're gonna start off tonight with a follow up, something we were talking about last week, Loki.
1887219	1899662	Yes, for the pre-Mario Day festivities earlier in the week, of course, Nintendo filing lawsuit against the Yuzu emulator.
1899662	1913266	And as kind of what I figured would happen, a company with a large amount of money bullying a smaller company with a lawsuit, of course, they're going to settle and, you know, take the...
1913746	1913806	and
1937853	1946459	Yeah, it's it's stupid, but I don't think the intent of the software was to pirate games, but there are some people that would use it for that.
1946459	1957806	Well, but anyways, but you realize it's hard to deny and disavow that when that talk is happening in your official discord that is paywalled behind a Patreon to get to
1958836	1961859	It's the optics really not good.
1961859	1965261	Like they brought in a lawyer, then they settled.
1965261	1969685	That means that lawyer said you equals fucked settle.
1972530	1980074	So yeah, so Traffic Haze, the company behind Yuzu, has agreed to pay $2.4 million to Nintendo.
1980074	1990839	They're going to cease offering Yuzu, and they also had the handover of yuzu-emu.org to Nintendo.
1990839	1997282	Along with that, they've also taken down Citra and the 3DS simulator as well.
1997282	1998463	Wait, what's the name of the website?
1998463	2000224	I want to see what message Nintendo put on it.
2000224	2000684	What's it called?
2002172	2030553	uh it's yuzu-emu or emu.org oops of course i mistyped it okay i just want to see if nintendo oh no it just says it's their goodbye letter is all this up there right now yeah um i'm glad i downloaded it for preservation purposes when the lawsuit happened everybody was like get get get get it now before it's well it was open source right
2031297	2033160	Yeah, so there's Yuzu out there.
2033160	2035363	It's clones.
2035363	2037346	You know, deviations all over now at this point.
2038342	2042223	Yeah, so yeah, so they've taken that down.
2042223	2046044	I've seen some other emulators also considering taking themselves down as well.
2046044	2060688	There's a Game Boy Advance Game Boy Color one that was unrelated, but they were looking at taking it down because of what happened here, which at least this didn't go to court and set a precedent for emulators because emulators are legal.
2060688	2062529	But, you know, obviously,
2064682	2069112	If they didn't have like the discussion within their own discord about piracy...
2070421	2072462	perhaps they would have had a little bit of a chance.
2072462	2081889	I don't think though necessarily that may have been the case because I think Nintendo would have dragged it out long enough to milk them until they essentially were bankrupt and then they'd have to settle.
2081889	2096580	If you really read into like what Nintendo says, they choose their words very carefully when they're responding to this because they're trying to make it sound like emulators are bad and lead to piracy and all this stuff even though we all know that's not true.
2097140	2102589	They also made him like put out a statement basically saying that, oh yeah, Yuzu is for piracy.
2102589	2103530	It's like, yeah.
2104130	2109652	Yeah, DarkSakura in chat says, Yeah, I thought we settled that in Bleem versus Sony, which I know is a topic that came up on Bobby's show tonight.
2109652	2124237	So yeah, I mean, like, and again, I think the excellent point that was brought up is that Nintendo uses their own emulator, like Nintendo runs emulators to make, you know, perhaps it's different when it's, you know, things that they own, but at face value, piracy.
2124237	2130059	But yeah, Nintendo also does emulators for things that are Sega and other things, but they have
2131039	2134020	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2147065	2151988	for the fact that your emulator is, you know, homebrew open.
2151988	2157751	You know, there's there's plenty of developers out there that will, especially especially for the classic stuff, right?
2157751	2164434	Like you look at like the main emulator and there's lots of old ass arcade games that people have made public domain at this point.
2164434	2174960	They have released the code and these the public domain so that emulators can sufficiently test themselves and so forth and, you know, bring light to these games that for the most part did not get a lot of light back in the day.
2174960	2175260	Yeah.
2175640	2176680	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
2190366	2208558	So you have to have that line in the sand though between the homebrew and the legitimate purposes of an emulator, what they're for, and you can't have talk on your official Discord about here's how to find the latest ROM of a game that's not out yet.
2208558	2211360	You're going to have to police that a little bit if you're going to run a community like that.
2212000	2214281	And that's I think the lesson to learn here.
2214281	2221704	So I I'm sad though, to see the other emulator developers kind of getting out and going like nope, noping out basically, I understand.
2221704	2226205	I'm sympathetic toward it because I'm not I'm not going to sit here and be like, No, you need to stay and fight the good fight.
2226205	2227026	I get it.
2227026	2229627	Like these lawsuits and the million dollar stuff.
2229627	2231027	It's very scary stuff.
2231027	2233008	And especially some of the things that Nintendo is saying.
2233008	2234228	So I get it.
2234228	2235649	But you know, you just
2236289	2244472	Anybody that's working in this just has to make sure they're in the clear because if Nintendo finds an opportunity, they're going to go for it.
2244472	2247213	And that goes with almost anybody.
2247213	2258437	You know, at this point, I don't think Sega gives a damn about their old hardware and things like that, you know, but you know, Nintendo, especially for a current, you know, system is going to take issue with this.
2258437	2258557	So.
2259841	2268490	Yeah, Questbuster also brings up a very good point saying settling with Nintendo also avoided whatever discovery their legal team would have to do.
2268490	2273235	Who knows what else Nintendo would have found on how Yuzu conducted their business.
2273235	2280763	So maybe there could have been things that were obtained in a not so great way.
2281906	2296047	other unreleased roms may I mean you you invent your own scenario here because that's all it is is speculation and maybe that's something the yuzu folks wanted to avoid as well which is why they they caved as quick as they did essentially
2298746	2301669	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2318867	2321910	S200mat in chat says emulation is key for game preservation.
2321910	2323171	We can all agree on that.
2323171	2328436	But when it gets into piracy of new unreleased games, you kind of don't have much of a leg to stand on.
2328436	2330518	That's succinctly it.
2330518	2332861	That is succinctly it in one sentence.
2332861	2334983	So all right, two sentences.
2334983	2335223	All right.
2336229	2336589	Moving on.
2352478	2355139	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2374369	2378973	like justify like is that actually the piracy of the actual movie?
2378973	2380834	No, I don't agree that it is.
2380834	2389481	If that video company has a back room where they're running duplications of said found film, then that's yes, that's a problem.
2389481	2391503	That's what happened here.
2391503	2392484	I don't think it.
2392484	2393424	I don't think it's the same.
2393424	2394866	But yeah, I understand.
2394866	2398529	But also, I think it's a stretch.
2398529	2399810	But you can't you can't.
2400706	2418803	let them have an opportunity and that's what they did is they created these very bad optics you're gonna pay on patreon to get in this discord where we're gonna talk about running a game on the emulator that isn't even out yet this is this bad optics anyway you slice it and that's what allowed nintendo to come in and shut it down
2419383	2422264	Nintendo didn't shut it down because it was an emulator.
2422264	2431208	Nintendo shut it down because they had that, we believe, over a million copies of Twilight, which, you know, one could argue if that figure was accurate or not.
2431208	2437351	But it's all about optics and making a jury believe you.
2437351	2437551	Anyway.
2438956	2440998	Let's go from one hot button issue to another.
2440998	2443300	Who wants to talk about AI?
2443300	2444241	Yay!
2444241	2445522	Alright.
2445522	2446963	Here's the thing.
2446963	2453008	I'm not sure, like, at face value, I think a lot of people make opinions on this, but I'm not sure, I mean, I don't know.
2453008	2458653	Somebody can explain it to me if it's worse than I think it is, because I actually think this isn't bad at all.
2458653	2460375	Which is wild, because I'm about to talk about EA.
2461756	2467260	So EA is talking about using generative AI to make development more efficient.
2467260	2476968	And this is from the CEO, Andrew Wilson, who spoke at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference and talked about some things which were live streamed.
2476968	2484894	And he was talking about how this era of generative AI is incredibly exciting and that they are embracing deeply the new technology.
2485635	2495398	He's talking about also how he thinks about using AI in three kind of pillars or three categories, efficiency, expansion, and transformation.
2495398	2504121	In a direct quote, he said, and now, of course, we're in the era of generative AI, which is the most exciting yet by a fairly wide margin, and something that we're embracing deeply.
2504121	2507683	We think about this in three core vectors, that's what I just said.
2507683	2511304	So he talks about how it takes a long time to develop a game.
2512783	2524468	And apparently in analyzing the game development cycle, he sees that in some of the processes, about 60% have high feasibility to be positively impacted by generative AI.
2524468	2528450	Brings up the example of building a stadium in a sports game.
2528450	2532092	Apparently, it used to take six months in the past.
2532092	2536354	In the past year, it took six weeks, and soon it will take six days.
2537034	2547522	And while we don't have the math of it yet, I would tell you in the back of my mind, my orientation is, how can we use generative AI to make us 30% more efficient as a company?
2557450	2561093	How in three years from today could we be 30% more efficient?
2561093	2564215	And I would tell you part of that is how do we get our people to embrace it?
2564215	2566937	And for creators of games, this is incredibly exciting.
2566937	2571580	The ability to get to the fun faster and get to market faster is the holy grail for them.
2571580	2578325	And so we see a real embrace happening inside of our company and around these things that can help them get to greatness much more quickly.
2582778	2585421	Generative AI impacts monetization on other platforms
2600274	2601715	That's already happening too.
2601715	2607419	I mean, if you're right, exactly curated to show you the content you want to see, like that's, yeah.
2607419	2616846	And I'm not necessarily certain like how they're, I think that they're using the phrase generative AI in not necessarily the right way.
2616846	2623751	Like, for example, that one of the examples they give is that Andrew Wilson is talking about AI can expand the experience for gamers.
2623751	2628015	I'm saying, for example, FIFA 23 had 12 run cycles for the players.
2629095	2636162	EA Sports FC 24 had 1200 all done with generative AI.
2636162	2642467	So that's almost like, you can have like physics based animation and stuff like that.
2642467	2654998	I'm not sure if they're considering that AI as well, or if they're like saying, okay, hey, here are, you know, I mean, they could be just doing like keyframing and having AI generate the inbetweens or something like that, which is
2655839	2656060	Tweening
2664048	2667591	Yeah, you know, admittedly, I need to know more about what's going on here.
2667591	2684504	But in looking at the context about the stadium and all that stuff, and especially if the generative AI is being trained off of EA's own work in EA's own system, you know, AI is I'm not as opposed to what's going on with AI when we talk about again, it's a tool in allowing things to become more efficient.
2684504	2686366	And I think when we talk about graphics, getting
2686886	2690548	Even greater pixels, 8K and things like that, more frames a second.
2690548	2696851	I think to some extent, AI is going to have to be a part of having that happen in a reasonable amount of time, right?
2696851	2704114	But when that replaces, so when AI facilitates art making, I'm a little more okay with it.
2704114	2706995	When AI replaces the art making, I'm not okay with it.
2706995	2708216	That's the problem.
2708763	2717261	I'm just more concerned because their games are kind of jank already or pretty jank just with, you know, the how quickly they turn them around each year.
2717714	2726537	And I get that they're trying to be more efficient, mainly just so that they could please their shareholders even more because infinite money and infinite growth.
2726537	2732299	But I just don't see them utilizing this in a positive way.
2732299	2740882	I think that this is just going to make their already janky games more jank and predatory monetization even more so.
2740882	2742942	And I don't know.
2742942	2743983	I just don't trust Andrew Wilson.
2745665	2749388	I keep having this mental image of the scene.
2749388	2753952	Do you remember the old Santa Claus movie from the 80s that had?
2753952	2756294	Oh, God, John Lithgow.
2756294	2756654	Was it?
2756654	2757695	Yeah, I'm trying to remember.
2757695	2758335	Dudley Moore.
2758335	2760517	Yeah, it had John Lithgow and Dudley Moore.
2761664	2778224	And how, like, his stuff was like, we'll automate everything and then they decided to do an automated, you know, Christmas and everything was falling apart and shitty because it was made with programmed machines that would eventually, you know,
2779668	2782329	It's just kind of the mental image I have right now.
2782329	2789312	You get what you pay for, and when you cut corners and stuff, you know, especially the way things are right now, people can tell.
2789312	2793354	You have the, you know, the AI art with multiple fingers.
2793354	2793734	What was it?
2793734	2799656	The Foamstar Games got a lot of shit for using AI in its soundtrack cover art, because everybody says it looks like garbage.
2799656	2804518	It looks like uninspired AI art is what it looks like.
2804518	2807540	You know, so I think, you know, there's always something wrong.
2807540	2807680	Yeah.
2808380	2812801	So I think, you know, when you take the heart out of it, there's there's that.
2812801	2814862	Um, let's see.
2814862	2818323	Fifth Dream in chat says two words procedural generation.
2818323	2824905	Imagine Elder Scrolls six with a world the actual size of Earth, you know, that shit would be crunch time if people had to plop down every tree.
2825405	2827906	Yes, and you know, Starfield.
2827906	2831547	Well, and No Man's Sky, which is fine, which is a game I really like.
2831547	2833948	Well, yeah, one better than the other.
2833948	2845972	Something different to when when what the the source the machine has to go off of is created by a limited group.
2845972	2847392	Makes sense.
2847392	2851594	Instead of using assets, you know, just from Lord knows where.
2853228	2855390	I prefer, like, the games not to be bigger.
2855390	2857351	I don't think they necessarily need to be bigger.
2857351	2860253	They just need to be as packed as Skyrim was.
2860253	2867679	Like, that was a game that was of adequate size, and with that, like, the world being big doesn't mean that it's big and empty.
2867679	2869740	It was big and full of things to do.
2869740	2872583	That's kind of where, like, with Starfield... Yeah, like Avatar.
2873143	2878186	Yeah, I mean, with Starfield, like, they're like, we're making it even bigger and all these planets and stuff.
2878186	2881447	It's like, yeah, but you didn't make content for all of those planets.
2881447	2886830	You procedurally generate like these same structures on all of those planets.
2886830	2890692	It's boring because it's just the same garbage over and over again.
2890692	2893354	Whereas at least No Man's Sky, everything's procedurally generated.
2893354	2898136	So there are actual like distinct things with each one of those planets.
2898136	2900017	I mean, sure, it starts to get a little bit samey, but
2900077	2900818	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
2922597	2936502	you know, every tree and every flower and those sorts of things being where they need to be where I'm not okay with AI is when we talk about generating the quest text and that type of thing on about generating the story filling in for the storytelling part of the game.
2936502	2938883	Yeah, that's where it crosses the line for me.
2938883	2939943	Yeah, that's not art.
2939943	2940863	Exactly.
2940863	2948306	So you know, I think we just kind of have to find again that right a balance where AI is a tool to the art and not a replacement to the art.
2948686	2949887	That's what it is.
2949887	2952109	AI as a tool for art is fine.
2952109	2954372	AI as a replacement for art is not fine.
2954372	2955693	That's how I view it.
2955693	2961799	Coming from EA though, just like with how they treat their games already and how it's just like it literally is.
2962452	2969838	You know, hey, we're removing features and we'll add them back a couple years later and pretend it's brand new and stuff and call it innovation.
2969838	2976083	Like they haven't innovated in any of those sports games in years.
2976083	2980246	And so like the fact that they're like, yeah, we're going to automate this even more.
2980246	2980526	It's like.
2982546	2984188	It can't be a good thing.
2984188	2985809	Like honestly, it can't be.
2985809	2990673	And Bobby does present this perspective, which was a little out of mind for me.
2990673	2996897	Because I feel like it's happening everywhere in the industry, but saying EA laid off 670 people last week.
2996897	2999919	Some of them are people that did things that generative AI could do instead.
3000720	3007102	You know, we're seeing this, this, this is not just EA, it's the entire industry has been losing people for, you know, various reasons.
3007102	3011143	And some, you know, could point at AI.
3011143	3022705	I pointed a lot of bad business decisions when it comes to doubling down on battle passes, not to get too far ahead of ourselves, and things of that nature and people making games that people don't want to play.
3022705	3028727	And I again, I feel like if the industry leans into the AI thing too hard,
3030199	3033182	People are going to see right through it.
3033182	3038447	I think there's a lot of business people at the top that really underestimate the gaming public.
3038447	3040949	I think Suicide Squad is a great example of that.
3040949	3048977	I think WB thought that game would sell on IP alone, and they severely underestimated how much gamers talk to each other and will share the very, very bad news.
3049517	3073306	yeah and that's the thing too like with games like that where they are even like trying to command a higher price tag already and then it's just like fundamentally broken and all that stuff and there's a lot of buzzwords that they try to throw around the industry to try to get people hyped up about different things you may remember and because it hasn't been mentioned in a while that cloud gaming was this huge thing not necessarily saying that you know
3073706	3076988	Cloud Gaming and the fact that, you know, we have game streaming stuff.
3076988	3080309	No, I'm talking about like cloud gaming to make games more powerful.
3080309	3086893	Remember Crackdown 3, how it's supposed to utilize the Azure cloud servers and be a fully destructible environment.
3086893	3088114	SimCity reboot.
3088114	3089774	Remember that dumpster fire?
3089774	3092736	Oh, yeah.
3092736	3096158	It's well, that that's multiple.
3097130	3106333	you know that the forced online only thing with that which which is unnecessary for I guess DRM or something, whatever it may be.
3106333	3108173	Why did games like that flop?
3108173	3112675	Well, I don't know so much about Crackdown 3, but SimCity in particular gamers fucking talk good.
3112675	3113415	They talk a lot.
3115302	3118503	Yeah, because they promised all this stuff and none of it was there.
3118503	3120143	And same with like Suicide Squad.
3120143	3128586	They promised like, I mean, you have a pedigree of this company that's made all these Batman Arkham games were just fantastic.
3128586	3131687	And they spent a very long time on this game.
3131687	3134227	And it's just, it's awful.
3134227	3138629	It's bad in like every sense of the word.
3138629	3142110	And it's just, it's not even done.
3142110	3143150	And it's just,
3145010	3153314	And they think they can also play off the success of the, you know, just of the Arkham universe alone, too.
3153314	3153634	Right.
3153634	3158037	And then they trashed the Arkham universe, just like even the way they killed off Batman in it.
3158037	3159697	It's just like, really?
3159697	3161678	This is this is how you're going to, you know...
3162819	3171725	Tribulize this character, you're just gonna basically say, oh, hey, you know, he was super cool in all these games and we're just gonna kill him off like a punk here.
3171725	3174026	Just, you know, like, thanks.
3174026	3174546	That's awesome.
3174546	3177488	It's like very disrespectful to the fans.
3177488	3181051	I mean, even once I learned the premise of the story, I was like, yeah, I'm not into this.
3181051	3185834	I mean, I don't like DC anyway, but this is just like even more reason not to play it.
3186567	3188129	I mean, I like Crackdown.
3188129	3194319	I mean, even though the last one kind of sucked, I would play this game just because of like the Crackdown-ness of it.
3194319	3199687	But then after seeing all the reviews and how like, it's just literally every mission is the same.
3199687	3200509	Yeah, I'm good.
3200509	3201811	But like, I don't need to play this.
3203352	3215059	Before we go to our next story, I have to bring this up at some point during the show because if we're going to talk about these CEOs and people that make way too much money in this industry to make some bad fucking decisions, I think some of you know where I'm going with this.
3215059	3217180	Have you heard the latest thing?
3217180	3222744	So of course, the whole like, we're going to ban TikTok thing is coming back all of a sudden.
3222744	3226826	And apparently, it looks like it might actually happen.
3226826	3227847	Like they might actually
3228567	3234410	and TikTok or I guess have it delisted from stores or whatever if the company fails to divest.
3234410	3243814	There is now a group spearheaded by, wait for it, Bobby Kotick looking to buy TikTok.
3243814	3251437	So for all those, for everybody that was wondering, what will that man shit on next now that he's out of the gaming industry?
3251437	3252858	You have your answer.
3252858	3253818	Congratulations.
3253818	3255459	He wants to get into social media.
3257196	3270377	I mean like I'm on TikTok lately I use I guarantee if Bobby Kotick buys that uninstall done not going back like if that if that's if I have a feeling he's not gonna be able to yeah
3272785	3275788	Anyway, Fifth Dream says good timing since ours are about to ban it.
3275788	3279671	To be fair, this is a problem on both sides because Biden said he'll sign it.
3279671	3280932	This is a problem on both sides.
3280932	3283974	Well, it's essentially that they're saying that they have to dive.
3283974	3291000	It doesn't necessarily have to go to Bobby Kotick, but it's essentially that they have to divest from their Chinese business partners.
3291000	3293582	So essentially they have to sell to like a U.S.
3293582	3296905	company or I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be a U.S.
3296905	3297125	company.
3297125	3297626	It could be like
3298266	3302695	a European company, a different company that's not in China, essentially.
3302695	3304679	But yeah, Bobby Kotick, ew.
3304679	3306402	I mean, if you really want to kill the platform, there you go.
3310667	3320992	This is the stupidest thing for Biden to do in an election year because there are going to be so many people that are going to associate.
3320992	3327756	If TikTok gets pulled away, there are going to be so many younger voters, which otherwise would probably be a little bit incentivized to vote.
3328376	3331958	for him that are going to say, you know what, I'm just going to stay home or I'm not going to vote.
3331958	3334799	I'm not going to do it because he shut down TikTok.
3334799	3338540	This is a stupid, stupid thing for him to be doing in an election year.
3338540	3339381	I'm just going to say it.
3339381	3345103	And I fully support him and plan on voting for him, especially to prevent the alternative.
3345103	3346804	God help us all.
3346804	3353127	And this is why I wince and I grimace when I see him making really bad decisions.
3356545	3357687	Bobby Blacko says I'm okay with-
3368760	3390023	Insensitive of age, but I think that we need a president that is young enough to be able to connect to a younger voting base and not too old to be stuck in how things used to be done, but still be old enough to have wisdom to know what to do with it.
3391544	3392265	Make sense?
3392265	3393786	Mm-hmm.
3393786	3399110	Ranma in chat says, the fact that government-managed phones have TikTok blocked, the app is a security hazard.
3399110	3402652	Bobby in chat says, I'm okay with government-managed phones having app restrictions.
3402652	3409617	Yeah, I'm fine with that, too, because, yeah, again, work phones should have work things on it, and TikTok's not a work thing.
3409617	3410998	Separate issue, right?
3410998	3413019	I think we all agree that's a separate issue.
3413019	3417562	Like, work phones can have work apps, and whatever can dictate what work apps look like.
3417562	3419003	Separate issue.
3419003	3420204	Fifth Dream in chat says,
3420584	3423025	People who use TikTok aren't old enough to vote.
3423025	3423885	Old man take.
3423885	3426366	That is an old man take and tells me you're not using TikTok.
3426366	3430327	Sorry, I'm not trying to be rude, but like... I've been using TikTok for a while.
3430327	3431848	I mean, a lot of people.
3431848	3433768	Yeah, look at the people posting videos on TikTok.
3433768	3438770	It's not children because children can't post videos on TikTok.
3438770	3441190	Doesn't stop them, but they're not supposed to.
3441190	3443191	No, yeah, they're not supposed to.
3443191	3444191	All right.
3444191	3446672	Anyway, um, let's move on.
3446672	3449433	Unfortunately, some sad news, but I'll turn it over to DarkSakura.
3452185	3473679	Yeah, so, icon, legend, we all... I'm surprised to find people who don't know this name, or have at least heard of it, but Toriyama Akira died because of an acute subdural hematoma, like a brain clot-ish type thing.
3475380	3480642	And he died on the 1st, and he was in the middle of many, many projects.
3480642	3488286	But yeah, it was very, very, very sudden.
3488286	3495810	I want to go ahead and read the message from Bird Studio and Capsule Corporation Tokyo.
3495810	3498071	But I'm going to also just try to
3499329	3500790	Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z
3519346	3527167	I don't like to acknowledge Dragon Ball GT, but yes, it existed in Dragon Ball Supers, which was pretty good.
3527167	3530608	It also did Dr. Slump.
3530608	3534569	It did Sand Land, a game.
3534569	3546111	He did the character designs for Chrono Trigger, for Blue Dragon, which was a RPG on Dreamcast, and all of the Dragon Quest series.
3547511	3551775	And it's funny.
3551775	3564127	I mean, I couldn't stand watching Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in English just because of how, like, butchered I would say a lot of the localization was.
3564127	3566429	I mean, I guess they did the best that they could, but, you know.
3569292	3573114	It was a very emotional thing.
3573114	3578017	I kind of had a shutdown right after where I couldn't feel anything for a while.
3578017	3580078	Okay, Blue Dragon was Xbox 360.
3580078	3582299	Sorry, I was thinking of something else.
3582299	3590364	But anyway, I remember being in college, this was like 95, and trading off
3594549	3617688	my 5 VHS tapes of Guyver, like legit ones, for a box of Dragon Ball Z fansubs and the movies fansubbed, and some Sailor Moon and some other stuff raw, and some Ranma 1 half fansubbed by the original fansubbers, the Ranma Project.
3618610	3620491	and a bunch of raw episodes.
3620491	3626434	And we sat, and we sat through the entirety.
3626434	3630256	We practically had our daily marathon to watch it.
3630256	3643583	So, but anyway, and then Chrono Trigger for me was very special because I'm sure y'all remember that I had been doing a fundraiser for my papa-san while she died during my marathon.
3644664	3659796	and one of her last messages to me on Facebook was telling me that one of her favorite memories of us hanging out was her coming in to watch me play Chrono Trigger.
3661229	3670997	Dear friends and partners, we are deeply saddened to inform you that manga creator Toriyama Akira passed away on March 1st due to acute subdural hematoma.
3670997	3672838	He was in age of 68.
3686889	3692113	It is our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm.
3692113	3694754	Okay, I think this is translated for the record.
3694754	3699077	Also, he would have many more things to achieve.
3699077	3703801	However, he had left many manga titles and works of art to the world.
3703801	3709184	Thanks to the support of so many people around the world, he has been able to continue his creative activities for over 45 years.
3710425	3718189	We hope that Toriyama's unique world of creation continues to be loved by everyone for a long time to come.
3718189	3722852	We inform you this sad news with gratefulness for your kindness during his lifetime.
3722852	3729215	Funeral service was held with his family in very few relations, following his wishes for tranquility.
3729215	3735339	We respectfully inform you that we would not accept flowers, condolence gifts, visiting offerings, and others.
3736740	3741304	Also, we would ask you to refrain from conducting interviews with his family.
3741304	3744507	Future plans for commemorate gathering is not decided.
3744507	3746629	We will let you know when it's confirmed.
3746629	3749992	We deeply thank you for your understanding and support as always.
3749992	3754497	March 8th, 2024, Bird Studio, Capsule Corporation, Tokyo.
3758804	3771994	Well, I would almost guarantee that one of those projects that was in development is Dragon Quest XII, and it's going to make that game really heavy, I think, when that game comes out, kind of knowing that that's very likely the last thing he's contributing to.
3771994	3773415	I know he had a work staff.
3773415	3779120	I don't know who his official successor was.
3779120	3782522	I'll see if I can find out a little bit more about that.
3782522	3786185	Do you know Dragon Quest XI was seven years ago at this point?
3786185	3787366	Isn't that wild to think about?
3789614	3791256	Um, okay.
3791256	3793337	I knew the name.
3793337	3810712	So, uh, Toyotaro, um, is, uh, he started off, uh, drawing, um, uh, a lot of, uh, you know, related manga, but he also did the manga for Dragon Ball Super.
3810712	3818238	Um, so I think he is, uh, he's, uh, Toriyama's successor.
3818238	3818338	Um,
3820802	3825150	Yeah, he's also done a lot of, he taught himself by doing fan art.
3825150	3830059	So if you ever think that your fan art isn't going to go anywhere, think again.
3832290	3850956	Um, you know, and I think a lot of gamers looking back fondly on, you know, the contributions to gaming culture through whether it be Dragon Quest or Dragon Warrior, as a lot of us discovered it as here on this side of the ocean when we were kids, or I think obviously the huge impact of Chrono Trigger, like, you know, you're talking about there.
3850956	3858738	I think that is a game that, you know, if you were of a certain age when that game came out, you were impacted by, you know, Toriyama's art at some point.
3859298	3863519	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3882512	3885114	Chrono Cross was the true successor of Radical Dreamers
3904062	3914264	So just, uh, obviously a tremendous loss for, you know, especially, you know, Japanese influence because, you know, Dragon Quest is big enough here.
3914264	3921806	And I think a lot of people know that, but think about how monumentally influential the Dragon Quest series is in Japan is.
3921806	3927367	So it's, it is a huge, huge loss for the gaming industry in Japan.
3927367	3931908	We watched an anime that was based on someone.
3933770	3941152	Uh, like virtually playing a Dragon Quest game and ended up thinking he was really the character.
3941152	3944573	It was, it was a pretty good show.
3944573	3945293	Very interesting.
3945293	3945893	I did not know this.
3945893	3951994	This is Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says apparently 20 to 30,000 showed up in the center of Buenos Aires today in support.
3951994	3955975	Dragon Ball is as big in South America as it was in Japan and elsewhere.
3955975	3958636	I can't, I I'm surprised, but I'm not.
3959943	3966807	You know, there's there's a lot of people here where it's not as popular that are definitely feeling this loss.
3966807	3977072	I always thought it was kind of I was a little bit jealous that, yes, there it's much been translated into Spanish Phoenix, and that's what was going on.
3977072	3983936	The original Dragon Ball Z opening song, which is probably one of my favorite anime theme songs ever, is Challa Head Challa.
3983936	3988619	That had been directly translated into Spanish for Dragon Ball Z.
3990080	3992962	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
4005885	4007526	Thank you for watching!
4033649	4034952	All right.
4034952	4041945	Um, okay, let's move on to a story we've been kind of bouncing back and forth on earlier in the show.
4041945	4043688	Let's let's bring this up to the table now.
4043688	4044851	So Loki, I'm gonna turn it over to you.
4045464	4054407	Yeah, Warner Brothers Discovery is going to be retiring several games that are part of Adult Swim games.
4054407	4059028	This includes, you know, I think they had, what was it?
4059028	4066510	Yeah, Headlander, Rain World, Kingsway, Volgar the Viking, Battle Chef Brigade.
4066510	4073272	There was another one, Small Radios, Big Televisions was actually kind of, I think what kind of kicked it off the developer of that
4073812	4081658	said that they he had received a notice from Warner Brothers that they're going to be delisting those games.
4081658	4084481	So it's going to happen within the next 60 days.
4084481	4089404	They're going to be let's let's also mention that guy pulled the power move of I'm just going to put it up for free.
4089404	4090906	Here you go.
4090906	4093868	Which was which I salute you.
4093868	4095409	I salute you for doing that.
4095409	4097451	That's the ultimate FU.
4097451	4100253	I mean, at that point, you're probably not making anything off of it anyway.
4100253	4101194	So, yeah, but I
4101750	4104512	Yeah, great for him.
4104512	4116941	Of course, along with that, and thanks to our background that we have here, there is also the notification that Warner Brothers Discovery is shutting down Rooster Teeth as well.
4116941	4120684	So they're ending the operations after 20 plus years.
4120684	4127449	This was announced via a company memo that was put up on their website.
4127449	4129050	And with that, I believe they said,
4130751	4136255	that the, I think that they're trying to sell off the podcast for it, but everything else is shutting down.
4136255	4137435	Jeez.
4137435	4138436	Which sucks.
4138436	4154867	I really liked Roasted Teeth and all the stuff that they had, especially early machinima stuff, you know, back in the day when that was kind of like the first kind of emerging video game type content, they kind of even, you know, kicked off the whole let's play type of trend as well.
4154867	4159610	So certainly influential in the space, but yeah, it sucks.
4160244	4164227	Phoenix 7726 in chat says Warner seems to be fucking up everywhere.
4164227	4179857	From our perspective, yes, but from the investor and capitalist perspective, no, because Zaslav is excellent at exploiting what I believe this practice is, exploiting these tax loopholes we have in this country that allow companies to profit off of art in this way.
4179857	4182719	And quite frankly, I wish Congress would take up this issue.
4182719	4185761	And I know a lot of people are saying, doesn't Congress have better things to do?
4185761	4188703	Probably, but guess what?
4188703	4189704	They won't get that done either.
4190124	4203949	And I think that when we're talking about these tax loopholes that these huge corporations are making money off of by burning art and writing it off, I'm sorry, if you burn art like Coyote vs. Acme, that shit should become public domain.
4203949	4211692	If you have wrote it off for a public loss, you have sold that to the public as far as I'm concerned, and now that ought to be public domain.
4212532	4216076	That is that is how you should be able to claim a tax break off of that.
4216076	4217057	I don't.
4217057	4220161	And frankly, I don't think it should be such a huge tax break anyway.
4220161	4222544	And I think that's probably what they're doing with this as well.
4222544	4223305	These are games.
4223305	4227950	And Loki, to your credit, these are games that are 10 to 15 years old at this point, to be fair.
4227950	4229572	These are very old games that are taking off Steam.
4229572	4229832	Why?
4231004	4233126	So they can probably take a tax write off on it.
4233126	4237830	And they're going to claim probably more than what they would have actually gotten from this whole thing.
4237830	4239391	And it's just it's cooking the books.
4239391	4246036	And I just I wish I wish Congress would take a look at this, but they won't because they can't do anything.
4246036	4247698	So whatever.
4249919	4255524	SG100 Matt says devs will have to change their games credits to not include Adult Swim games.
4255524	4260208	They should change the thank you portion of their games credits to Fire David Zaslav.
4260208	4261329	I'd love that personally.
4264483	4270846	Phoenix7726 says, Rob, also the decision to change HBO Max to Max was also foolish.
4270846	4276809	Almost as bad as Twitter to X. Not that bad, but let me just put it this way.
4276809	4279651	I don't subscribe, but I didn't subscribe then.
4279651	4280651	I don't subscribe now.
4280651	4282572	I'm not exactly in a hurry to, to be honest.
4284366	4288489	Yeah, and I I am kind of like it's not it's not that bad.
4288489	4292212	The Twitter to X thing is there's no point for it.
4292212	4297916	And you'll notice for all the talk of wanting to own the town square.
4297916	4300158	Y'all know what you're doing by get me going on a Twitter rant.
4301513	4306035	The Town Square has decided, we reject that.
4306035	4311577	The council has heard your idea, we think it's a stupid idea, and so we're going to ignore it.
4311577	4314078	That is exactly what's happening with the whole X thing.
4314078	4324662	The people aren't calling it that because that is a stupid name for a failing company that is nothing but porn bots now at this point in replies and things like that.
4326377	4337209	It's I I really don't know how Twitter is still operating to be quite honest, but whatever it is what it is.
4337209	4338310	Let's see.
4338310	4341935	S200 Matt says the town square now deletes community notes when they feel like it.
4341935	4342155	Well,
4346246	4349029	Y'all keep using it and see how that goes for you.
4349029	4353253	Like, I'm telling you how to make an impact, but it's I get it.
4353253	4354354	Oh, no.
4354354	4363463	The big thing that they've been doing is removing community notes when people have posted certain pro
4365165	4365566	DarkSakura
4382225	4384287	Y'all know what you can do about it if you don't like it.
4384287	4386790	That's that and I've said it a million times on blue in the face.
4386790	4388812	So we'll just move on.
4388812	4389773	All right.
4389773	4391855	Anyway, this WB thing.
4391855	4392756	It sucks.
4392756	4394978	And I hate that they keep getting away with it.
4394978	4401285	So I think we need to keep browsing the rabble rabble that you know what this this practice should not be as legal as it is.
4402025	4403006	Thanks for watching!
4416840	4424766	By the way, it would take one hero to fix this Coyote vs. Acme situation.
4424766	4425947	One hero.
4425947	4427828	And there's people out there that could do it.
4427828	4429610	And there's several people out there that could do it.
4429610	4434613	Because keep in mind, they were shopping that movie around to actual studios.
4434613	4436175	They were shopping that movie around.
4436175	4437296	How do they shop the movie around?
4437296	4439357	They gotta show it.
4439357	4441879	So that movie's sitting on a hard drive somewhere.
4441879	4445642	And one hero could change the narrative significantly on all of this.
4449284	4452785	Alright, moving on.
4452785	4454705	Podculture says I want to see Batgirl dammit.
4454705	4457766	My understanding is Batgirl was not as finished of a film.
4457766	4464347	I don't know if it was that the special effects and those types of things were not finished, and so forth or what actually exists of that.
4464347	4469388	But again, as a tax write off, whatever was done should be belong to the public now.
4469388	4472608	And maybe we would see different public interpretations of what that movie should look like.
4472608	4473869	I don't know.
4473869	4475489	So anyway,
4477956	4483479	Sj100mat says someone offered to cover the expenses to show Coyote vs Acme at South by Southwest to help shop it.
4483479	4487261	Warner Brothers Discovery still said no.
4487261	4493023	Mike Def says one hero that will probably get blacklisted in the industry, but it will make a statement and will be remembered as a hero by many.
4493023	4493544	Absolutely.
4494264	4495405	Absolutely.
4495405	4496266	All right.
4496266	4504412	Well, let's move on and talk about this, which I feel like this topic has kind of come up before, but we have some kind of definitive statements on this.
4504412	4514841	And that is Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth and, you know, Reborn or whatever the ultimate third version is called at some point when the trilogy finishes here.
4515581	4518023	Is this something we're ever going to see on Xbox Game Pass?
4518023	4520085	And the answer is definitively no.
4520085	4530915	Even though there have been other titles like Final Fantasy XIII, you know, other Final Fantasy XII, other games that have made their way to Xbox Game Pass eventually, the Final Fantasy VII trilogy will not be one of them.
4530915	4539282	This is from a comment that Christian Svensson, who is the vice president of second and third party content at Sony Interactive Entertainment said, which is,
4540063	4547387	Securing the Final Fantasy VII Trilogy as a console exclusive is a feather in the PlayStation cap.
4547387	4552550	It's part of recognizing the original game's importance as a defining game for the PlayStation experience.
4554071	4559934	Back in that same console generation, the original PlayStation, Sony Computer Entertainment had few franchises of its own.
4559934	4567137	And in order to find a place in a very competitive video game industry, we sought to win the hearts and mind of key third party developers like Square.
4567137	4569858	That is a that is very much a true statement.
4569858	4573299	Final Fantasy 7 is when I started paying attention to Sony.
4573299	4576941	So that that's a very true statement.
4576941	4578781	But also a very definitive answer.
4578781	4580982	It's a console exclusive.
4580982	4581843	So it'll come out on PC.
4583396	4586737	not gonna happen on Xbox, not gonna happen on Nintendo platforms.
4586737	4588478	So there you go.
4588478	4594881	So if you want to play the game, you're gonna have to suck it up and get a PlayStation or wait for the inevitable PC release.
4594881	4605265	Maybe hoping it's on a cloud thing that works if ironically, on a cloud thing that works if your PC is not up to muster to be able to run it, but hopefully the technology gets cheaper and all that stuff.
4606385	4610287	Phoenix says, is it even on Xbox at all?
4610287	4612868	Not the reboot trilogy.
4612868	4614049	Not the remake trilogy.
4614049	4616630	The original FF7 is, I believe.
4616630	4619691	The one that also came to PC at some point.
4619691	4620291	That all is.
4624233	4631581	But Phoenix also points out, Rob, on the flip side, Final Fantasy XIV was also thought to not come out to Xbox originally, but it did eventually.
4631581	4633883	That was never secured as an exclusive, though.
4633883	4636646	Here's the thing about Final Fantasy XIV.
4636646	4646256	If you actually played it on PC, when it first came out for PC, if you plug in a controller, all the button mappings were Xbox branded.
4648654	4652275	It was to the Windows Xbox specifications.
4652275	4653295	And that's even true now.
4653295	4656596	You plug in a controller, you're going to see Xbox branding.
4656596	4676259	So it was always an interesting gap, but it was assumed that it was one between Square and Microsoft and some type of Xbox limitation of them not wanting the game on the platform because of the cross-play, which was always ridiculous because Final Fantasy XI was a thing.
4676639	4678820	Everybody fucking forgets.
4678820	4681040	Final Fantasy XI was a thing.
4681040	4686262	Final Fantasy XI broke a lot of fucking rules with all of this.
4686262	4688022	All of it.
4688022	4693864	And Final Fantasy XI, to be fair, continues to still be a thing, although it is exclusive to PC at this point.
4693864	4699885	They no longer support it on any of the console versions, but kind of interesting.
4699885	4700186	All right.
4700186	4704567	Anyway, let's move on to some exciting and unsurprising news.
4704567	4705127	DarkSakura.
4706877	4713680	Yeah, oh, I'm just enjoying the quiet all of a sudden.
4713680	4720764	Okay, so I'm very proud of the Activision QA workers.
4720764	4733010	They have gotten together 600-some-odd workers from Activision's Publishing's Quality Assurance Department and have formed a union.
4734218	4745152	They were assisted by the Communications Workers of America and they completed their vote which had them certified by the 8th, a couple days ago.
4745152	4749697	And so they are now Activision Quality Assurance United.
4749697	4750238	They are
4751900	4758829	basically rising out of Microsoft's gaming division to put their foot down.
4758829	4765618	Microsoft did, as we know, affirm a labor neutrality agreement with the CWA before.
4768360	4771842	But I just I think this is this is great.
4771842	4788150	They were the quote from Tom Shelley, who is one of their specialists with that group, says that this has been an emergent effort that's arisen in the last few weeks in response to the opportunities we've had to freely organize following the merger.
4788150	4794213	As QA workers, we often have the weakest protections and lowest pay of any workers in history in the industry.
4794213	4794473	Sorry.
4794973	4800182	Even though our work is integral to the success of the companies we work for and the titles we make.
4800182	4802525	Amen to that.
4802525	4807373	And yeah, I think that that's awesome.
4807373	4809817	I think that we're seeing a little bit more
4812504	4825467	I think it's great that Microsoft themselves have done some work to recognize other unions as well, like the ZeniMax online union.
4825467	4834849	But we're really seeing a lot more unionization in the industry, and I'm super proud of that.
4834849	4840150	I wish I would need to see what was going on with that complaint against Sega.
4842583	4847127	I think to Microsoft's credit, I think they know this is just a train that can't be stopped.
4847127	4849449	So they're not trying to take the perspective of stopping it.
4849449	4855754	They're taking the perspective of coping or how do they, you know, make it work in their vision and so forth.
4855754	4858256	I think that's where Microsoft's at.
4858256	4864481	A company literally does come out looking like the bad guy by union busting and sitting against it.
4864481	4866763	You know, we hear union busting.
4866763	4869986	And I don't know, my thoughts go back to historical, you know,
4872728	4874309	I'm really, really quite pleased to see all of this.
4893291	4897116	leaning in toward this collaboration and unionization going on.
4897116	4899459	I'm very happy about it.
4899459	4905948	I wish other companies would hop on board.
4905948	4907490	You know, and I
4909423	4914827	I know of some in the tech industry that are working on.
4914827	4916529	I want to see something coming from that.
4916529	4924335	There's a lot that's still very, very quiet that I think we're going to see some very surprising things come up through the year.
4927125	4930988	I agree this is going to continue this this more.
4930988	4934852	I think this is the biggest one as of now, but I think there's going to be bigger coming.
4934852	4941237	So especially in light of everything that's happened with the layoffs and everything in this industry, I think you're going to see you're going to see more.
4941237	4942819	So Union.
4942819	4943399	So we'll see.
4944720	4947882	Alright, let's move on.
4947882	4949543	Loki, going back.
4949543	4951705	Boy, you're loving to talk about this company tonight, aren't you?
4951705	4953126	Let's talk about Warner some more.
4953126	4956848	Yeah, let's kick him a little more.
4956848	4973860	So when Warner Brothers saw the success of Suicide Squad, in other words, their below expectation Suicide Squad, being a live service game for one, and that not a lot of people liked that, and they didn't like how the game seemed to be
4974700	4982303	Rushed but also not rushed in the sense that it would took a long time, but still sucked So you know what they said?
4982303	4991868	Hey, you know what instead of going back to the drawing board and maybe making another AAA single-player game They're like now we're gonna double down on live service games.
4991868	4996370	In fact, that's what they're planning on doing because they're saying that it's
4997501	5002983	challenging to release games and have one flop like this.
5002983	5007245	And so essentially it makes their year bad or something.
5007245	5020951	So I think what the push is here is that, well, we could churn out like say four, not so great live service games, but we'd earn extra money with people buying all the monetization with that, I think is the thought process.
5022677	5024578	This is so stupid.
5024578	5033360	This is I mean, I'm sorry, this is and then this leads to them writing off more games and selling off gaming history and deleting it from Steam and stuff.
5033360	5037302	This is this is so well on top of that, you have these games.
5037302	5039322	How stupid do they think gamers are?
5039322	5041623	How well stupid do they think gamers are?
5042415	5065885	On top of that, like if you want to go back to, you know, throwing art into, you know, basically just pissing all over artwork, you know, live service games like this, typically when they shut down the servers for those after, obviously, it's not going to be a very long time, I'll be surprised if this game lasts a year, they stop working, which sucks for preservation in the first place as all, so.
5069686	5077361	I don't understand how these companies think that with 500 live service games in the pipeline
5078410	5081752	Like where are you going to get the player base for that?
5081752	5083834	Like it's not going to happen.
5083834	5087256	It's the MMO issue all over again.
5087256	5089658	World of Warcraft comes out.
5089658	5100385	Everybody thinks they can make a game with a monthly fee and make an MMO and charge a monthly fee for it, because that's that's the solution to keep printing money is to just charge a monthly fee for your game.
5100385	5102126	And then what happens?
5102126	5108250	Quick, name a successful MMO outside of World of Warcraft not called Final Fantasy.
5111496	5113901	It's going to take you a minute to think of them.
5113901	5114783	Eve Online.
5114783	5118290	Eve, well, even currently, is Eve Online still going?
5118290	5118932	Elder Scrolls.
5120963	5122963	Lineage EverQuest Elder Scrolls
5143084	5148147	Sj100mat says, but in their defense, folks still buy into these things.
5148147	5152490	So why not keep throwing crap at the wall to see what sticks for continuing to fund a game?
5152490	5155232	No, and don't get me wrong.
5155232	5158253	You are going to have a player base of people that do support these types of games.
5158253	5159974	It's not going to be enough to pay the people who made the game.
5159974	5161135	Right, exactly though.
5161135	5165358	But that's the thing though, is you have a player base right now of these people, but
5166258	5175765	you can't spread that to 500 games like it's just it's not physically gonna happen like one people have a finite amount of time and money so like
5176604	5178025	It's just not going to happen.
5178025	5187814	Like, and I get it that you may get, you may pick up some more people with different types of games that may be live service games that you might appeal to some folks that aren't into these other ones.
5187814	5201045	But there's a lot of people that don't want to play these types of games because it feels like, because they're like, yeah, we want you to log on and want you to grind and earn, you know, stuff like work, basically work a job at a game.
5201045	5202687	It's like, well, I don't want to do that.
5202687	5203588	Like I want to play a game.
5204554	5209155	Don't work a game you could don't even do you even know what games are like?
5209155	5210155	I don't know it.
5210155	5212656	I have a feeling that this is just going to backfire.
5212656	5213316	Absolutely.
5213316	5218297	And they should take a good hard look at why people aren't buying into Suicide Squad.
5218297	5228699	I mean, like there's just so many examples of live service games that are not successful, like a lot of them, tons and tons of them.
5228699	5230520	Like I don't understand why this would be a
5231661	5234763	I guess they're just naive and think, oh, well, ours will be different.
5234763	5236805	I'm sure that's what everybody says.
5236805	5238546	Like, and it's just not going to happen.
5238546	5243229	You got to just put out a quality game instead.
5243229	5250854	Sorry, Quest Western Chat says, Meanwhile, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to rack up awards for being a good game that came with everything, and it's still selling.
5250854	5252575	That's the other thing to point out.
5252575	5253916	It's still selling.
5253916	5258399	No Man's Sky releases on the Switch years after its original release.
5258399	5259320	It's still selling.
5260219	5262965	because it puts out all this additional content for free.
5262965	5267215	These games that are well known and have a reputation for being an all one package.
5267915	5269096	do just fine for themselves.
5291334	5298980	Yes, like EA, for example, with their live service games, Predatory Monetization, makes a buttload of money.
5298980	5302342	And so that's really what the investors care about in the end.
5302342	5304644	They don't care if the games are absolute trash.
5304644	5316673	And like, let's be honest, like when we went going back to EA, a lot of their games are absolute trash in the end, because they just churn the same game every single year, literally copy and pasting for some of these.
5316673	5316833	And
5318965	5322307	There's an install base that just doesn't care.
5322307	5326089	And until you get those people to care, they're going to continue to be exploited.
5326089	5328251	And this is going to be the garbage that you get.
5328251	5333814	But then again, there's also all these independent studios and to go support them instead.
5333814	5337316	SSJ100 Matt says it will have to burst like crypto for them to pivot off.
5337316	5347883	Well, if this if the failure of Suicide Squad is not the fucking smoke that shows you there's a big dumpster fire brewing, I don't I don't know what to tell these executives and people in power to change their mind.
5349780	5356548	Questbuster in chat says, going back to a statement Rob made earlier, it does feel like WB expected the IP to carry the game.
5356548	5357849	Yes.
5357849	5359791	Yes, they did.
5359791	5364276	Because unfortunately, it worked for them when it came to Harry Potter.
5364276	5369301	And so now they think every game can be that.
5369301	5370262	Yeah.
5370262	5371284	Anyway.
5371284	5371544	All right.
5372512	5373913	Moving on.
5373913	5375033	Let's talk about this.
5375033	5376674	Oh, this is this is kind of sad.
5376674	5377714	I really like this company.
5377714	5382416	And so you you hate to hear about your faves getting hacked and all this stuff and their stuff getting put all out there.
5382416	5383917	But I also feel like
5388313	5397543	WayForward is the company, and WayForward has made the Shantae series, they did the Advance Wars 1 and 2 reboot, they did DuckTales Remastered back in the day.
5397543	5402950	In fact, some of the data was, apparently a drive was found somewhere.
5403450	5417280	that allowed prototypes and source code for some old WayForward games to leak out, including Shantae Risky's Revenge, DuckTales Remastered, Adventure Time, Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?
5417280	5418942	Remember, that was a real game on the DS.
5418942	5421443	And some other WayForward DS games as well.
5421443	5424286	So the code and all this is available online.
5424286	5427268	There's websites, you can find all the prototypes and all this stuff as well.
5427708	5444826	What is interesting though, the person who said that they are in possession of the data has said they are not leaking anything on the Switch Shantae Advanced Risky Resolution, which is supposed to come out later this year.
5444826	5447008	That's very interesting.
5447008	5448630	But yeah, so
5450270	5454031	The old stuff is leaked, but that from my perspective, I'm like, well, it's old stuff.
5454031	5458572	It's not like it's newer way forward titles that are going to, you know, have an impact.
5458572	5469715	I, and I understand maybe this risky revolution is a concern because the, this was a, that was a title that was originally developed like 20 years ago, and then they shelved it and now they're supposed to resurrect it for the switch.
5469715	5474876	So maybe there's concern about that, but the leaker or whoever has said they're not going to touch that.
5474876	5477437	So it's kind of interesting that they are, um,
5478649	5481198	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5485865	5490506	But again, DuckTales Remastered is how old now?
5490506	5492747	It's probably not going to hurt them tremendously to have this out there.
5492747	5496388	If it was newer titles, I think people would care more.
5496388	5508972	But this is probably one of those things where it's like, it's actually probably better the less WayForward talks about it, because then the less the news trickles down to people like us and other websites to then remind you that this information is out there should you choose to seek it out.
5508972	5513954	But for me, from where I'm sitting, I see no need to seek it out.
5514594	5517920	There might be people out there very curious on how games work.
5517920	5519102	How did they do that?
5519102	5520344	How did they code that?
5520344	5521867	I'd like to do something like that.
5521867	5524351	There might be other people out there that are seeking that sort of thing out.
5524351	5524972	Me, I'm not.
5528371	5532315	DarkSakura also reminds us they have Contra OG dropping in a couple days.
5532315	5534598	There's a demo on Xbox that apparently is pretty good.
5534598	5536240	I forgot there was a demo out there.
5536240	5537741	Interesting.
5537741	5539443	I'll check that out at some point.
5539443	5540364	All right.
5540364	5547653	Well, with all of these OG titles we're talking about all of a sudden, there's really only one segment that would be appropriate to do next.
5558368	5566115	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5566115	5569278	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5569278	5574082	And what did you pick for the other Classic Game of the Week this week, DarkSakura?
5574082	5579887	I picked a mindfuck of a game called Purirura.
5579887	5582369	It is an arcade game that came out in 1981 by Taito.
5586009	5594614	It later came out on the FM Towns Marty, the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 in Japan.
5594614	5600899	Although the PS1 and Saturn versions are called Puri Rura Arcade Gears.
5600899	5609465	The PS2 version is part of a compilation from Taito Memories Volume 1 that did not come out in the international release of Taito Legends.
5609465	5612206	It's a fucking weird-ass beat-em-up game.
5614828	5622692	So, Puli Rula takes place in this area called Radishland.
5622692	5630155	And it's a place where they keep time flowing properly with a time key.
5630155	5633836	This is a quote from the English translation.
5645282	5655571	So you play as characters named Zack and Mel and are requested by an old guy to go
5657034	5662076	Beat up all the bad guys with a magic stick.
5662076	5669918	So player one is Zack, player two is Mel, who is actually based on Little Bo Peep.
5669918	5675300	And you have to just fight the enemies until you hit a boss at the end of the area.
5675300	5680121	When you're hit, you get turned into an animal and run off screen.
5680121	5685043	You get points if you walk into animals.
5685043	5685943	But this is...
5688115	5695099	For those watching live right now, I'm sure you can see the kind of bizarreness about this.
5695099	5701303	You have some weird-ass enemies that you fight.
5701303	5706245	And you kind of walk around in, I don't know, it kind of reminds me of Old Flash a little bit.
5708735	5714262	But there is a little bit of controversy.
5714262	5720050	The original version had this area where
5721164	5735068	You're basically, you've got like this wall with a kind of an arch in the center and two open arches to either side of it and out of the two side ones are legs.
5735068	5742711	Just kind of like you're looking up a pair of ladies legs wearing red thigh highs.
5742711	5747192	And occasionally pink elephants come out of there.
5749977	5754391	There was an international release of this, and they omitted that.
5754391	5755815	This is only the Japanese version.
5759014	5764358	But yeah, it's just a really visually... Midna, get down!
5764358	5767160	Sorry, my cat was clawing up my other chair.
5767160	5772443	It's just a really weird visually game.
5772443	5776366	You beat up the bad guys and they turn into animals and they're cute.
5776366	5783251	This is the really weird boss that kind of freaks me out because it looks like she's pogo-sticking off of her nose.
5783251	5786994	She's just a head with a huge nose and red boots.
5786994	5787254	But yeah.
5788586	5789707	It's kind of fun, though.
5789707	5796790	I mean, if you can get past the weird, it's pretty fun.
5796790	5799511	There were some nods to this game, though.
5799511	5810736	In Bubble Symphony, you know, in the Bubble Bobble series, or Puzzle Bobble, I should say, there's a stage that's based on Puli Rula.
5812536	5817738	Enemies and the boss characters are from this game.
5817738	5825700	There was a limited edition soundtrack by Pony Canyon released July 17, 1992.
5825700	5831902	And the character Zack was also an assist character for Arkanoid vs Space Invaders on iOS and Android in 2016.
5833562	5838123	And one last thing, an anime that I have.
5838123	5842564	Oh, this is the one where they have the digitized person who comes up at the screen.
5842564	5846585	Anyway, like I said, weird ass game.
5846585	5855646	Zack and Mel have a cameo in episode 17 of High Score Girl, which is an anime I am pretty fond of.
5855646	5857527	But yeah.
5857527	5859307	Here you go.
5859307	5861808	Enjoy.
5861808	5862988	Enjoy the enjoy the
5864164	5867706	Brain Crack.
5867706	5868447	Go play it.
5868447	5871529	Podculture in chat says, God, I'm glad I'm sober watching this.
5871529	5873890	Yeah, very.
5873890	5879293	I think if you were on a particular substance or two, this this would be even weirder.
5879293	5884337	Also, and people listening at home, just go back and watch the VOD at this point.
5884337	5884757	Yeah.
5884757	5888039	Or just, you know, it's very easy to find the footage of this game if you know how to spell.
5889428	5891670	What's the name of the game?
5891670	5915508	It's P U Asterix L like Lima, I like Indigo Asterix R like Romeo, U like Uniform Asterix L like Lima, A like Alpha So, and between every syllable the P U L I R U L A the asterix is necessary because that's how the game is spelled
5917628	5923390	It's a good thing that but in the background is covered or we might be in violation of Terms of Service right now.
5923390	5927392	Well, that's a sumo.
5927392	5931834	I know, I know, but it doesn't leave much to the imagination.
5931834	5934735	Well, I mean, it's traditional.
5934735	5936596	We can say it's artistic.
5936596	5936876	All right.
5938188	5940209	Well, maybe I should take the footage down at this point.
5940209	5948852	But this is this is this actually my favorite stage that we were just showing was the fighting the Kabuki actor.
5948852	5958115	Well, you know, some folks in chat were suggesting this would have been a great candidate for your flag segment last year, which, you know, once a month DarkSakura mixes it up.
5958115	5960716	But I thought this was an arcade game.
5960716	5961696	Well, I mean, I was
5963007	5967150	I was more going for like the physical arcade games, I guess.
5967150	5967670	Yeah, I get it.
5967670	5968130	I get it.
5968130	5972513	But well, I just go back to there's only 12 months in a year, right?
5972513	5974774	So there's going to be more weird arcade games.
5974774	5981278	I had a hard time finding things sometimes, but no, but this this I look at games like this in
5982259	5984700	You know, as actual game in the category.
5984700	5996102	Well, I think the most interesting part of it, because I did not know this game, but I think when you were talking about the appearances that it had in other games, I think it's always interesting to kind of know where that came from.
5996102	5998122	It's kind of like, oh, interesting.
5998122	6006424	So, yeah, that's what I like to bring that up, because that way, you know, like why are there pink elephants in this?
6006424	6009625	Oh, I also think it's funny because
6011990	6025794	The concept of the pink elephant is, and you actually saw some of it in old Winnie the Pooh, is that pink elephants are meant to be a hallucination.
6025794	6034717	I know that you used to mix your metaphors before by saying pink elephant in the room, which would indicate that everybody was hallucinating.
6034717	6035437	Sometimes they are.
6036539	6054421	Yeah, but, uh, so that just to me lends even more to, uh, the, uh, the whole fever dream part of this by having, you know, a building with lady legs with pink elephants coming out of the Twatl region.
6055840	6059841	Um, PogCulture in chat says drugs were involved with this.
6059841	6065142	Let me, let me tell you something about some of your favorite Atari 2600 games of the 80s.
6065142	6069983	Let me, let me tell you some things about how those aggressive deadlines were met.
6069983	6070704	Anyway.
6070704	6071264	All right.
6071264	6074385	It's, uh, it's, it's definitely, you know what?
6074385	6081426	I, I might have to bust this out on stream someday just to say, Hey, get ready to hallucinate.
6081426	6082406	That's right.
6082406	6083727	Get your shots ready.
6083727	6084447	You're going to need them.
6087128	6093293	All right, let's cover a couple other quick headlines here with some rapid fire news.
6093293	6094955	Loki, we'll go to you.
6094955	6096356	All right.
6096356	6107966	So the Helldivers 2 Studio Arrowhead Game Studio has had to go to social media to let people know, hey, no, we are not being acquired by Sony.
6107966	6111890	So just to let you know, they're not being acquired by Sony.
6111890	6112991	Thank you for the update.
6115761	6122784	And then Temtem is going to stop receiving content updates.
6122784	6137630	The devs have apologized for its shortcomings, but they said that patch 1.8 will complete the transition, allowing for players to cycle through previous season passes in order to reduce FOMO.
6137630	6140811	But they're not going to be adding any more content at the end.
6140811	6143292	They're just going to be recycling the old stuff.
6143292	6143652	All right.
6145691	6146052	DarkSakura
6155117	6160160	Getting a little bit more love from Microsoft.
6160160	6183576	Xbox Game Pass subscribers or PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate that have Boostroid memberships can stream Game Pass titles or things purchased through the Microsoft Store on Windows through Boostroid, including games like Deathloop, Dishonored, Dishonored 2, Gears, Stuff, Ghostwire Tokyo, Pentament.
6183576	6184777	So, yeah.
6185798	6199137	And they have a 10-year deal with the Boostroid company that's from Kiev, Ukraine.
6199137	6200159	So, cool.
6202120	6202941	Wordle Knockoffs
6222118	6226022	Apparently some DMCA's have gone out recently.
6226022	6234130	The New York Times filed a notice against Chase Wackerfuss, who is behind a Wordle clone called Reactl.
6234130	6242198	Apparently this was up on GitHub, so they're saying that GitHub has to delete the infringing repository and all of the forked repositories that came off of this.
6243759	6254365	Chase Wackerfuss who the notice was against has already taken down the GitHub page saying it's not worth getting into a legal battle with the New York Times over this.
6254365	6269494	However, it was forked, which is when somebody kind of takes a derivative of that, 1,900 times before it was removed and used to create other versions of Wordles in different languages, spin-offs with twists, crossword, two-player games, and so forth.
6269494	6270174	So, hmm.
6271915	6277200	The newspaper, The Times, is claiming ownership of the name Wordle and the mechanics.
6277200	6290251	The Times' Wordle copyright includes the unique elements of its immensely popular games, such as the 5x6 grid, green titles to indicate correct guesses, yellow titles to indicate the correct letter but the wrong place, and the keyboard directly beneath the grid.
6290251	6292112	That's a stretch, I'm sorry.
6292112	6298818	The gameplay is copied exactly in the repository, and the owner instructs others how to knock off the game and create an identical word game.
6300160	6304863	So anyway, it's not like Wordle is a very hard game to make.
6304863	6308446	So I don't I don't know to what extent the York Times is going to keep chasing this down.
6308446	6310868	But well, I hope you enjoyed that.
6310868	6315171	I hope you enjoyed that fun trip down memory lane of like, remember Wordle?
6315171	6323957	Remember when that game had a chokehold on everybody and then the Times bought it and a lot of people were like, yeah, I'm over it.
6323957	6324277	All right.
6325290	6332352	Let's travel around the world and check out some dates of games that are coming out that are new, unlike Wordle.
6332352	6334513	Not a lot this week, that's for sure.
6334513	6335293	Yeah.
6335293	6337654	So we have a few things.
6337654	6342635	Contra Operation Galuga on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.
6342635	6344456	That's that game Dr. C was talking about earlier.
6344456	6345316	Yep.
6345316	6347457	PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6347457	6348157	I get it.
6348157	6348797	Operation.
6348797	6350858	It's OG.
6350858	6351518	I get it.
6352904	6359587	I'm the last person in the internet to get that joke.
6359587	6362308	We have Llamasoft, the Jeff Minter story.
6362308	6364089	That's that new digital game.
6364089	6365830	Oh, yeah.
6365830	6367071	So that's out this week as well.
6367071	6368311	That was genuine.
6368311	6369572	I loved the last.
6369572	6372753	Oh, my God.
6372753	6374594	I love that Gold Master Series.
6374594	6376275	I love the Karateka one.
6376275	6378356	So I didn't realize this was around the corner.
6378356	6378736	That's great.
6379016	6385901	Yeah, that's on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch.
6385901	6391326	And the last thing for this week, we have Ib on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6391326	6391666	That's it.
6392438	6395540	All right, well, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases there.
6395540	6404107	On the Nintendo Switch this week, we have Macross Shooting Insight comes out in both, of course, a regular and limited edition because that's how many games are done in Japan.
6404107	6407849	Believe it or not, that is the only release on the Nintendo Switch this week.
6407849	6411452	That same game is released on the PlayStation 5.
6411452	6418877	We also have on the PlayStation 5 a game called Ib is also coming out in regular and deluxe editions as well.
6418877	6419318	And that
6419898	6421159	DarkSakura, how about Europe?
6435148	6437369	A handful.
6437369	6444773	Coming out on the 14th for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch is Garden Life, A Cozy Simulator.
6444773	6447795	I love that they're just putting cozy in the names now.
6447795	6449435	And the others are on the 15th.
6449435	6454678	For the same three, we have PJ Masks, Power Heroes, Mighty Alliance.
6454678	6459240	For Switch, we have Kingdom Come, Deliverance, Royal Edition.
6459240	6464123	And then for PlayStation, Xbox, and computer, Outcast, and New Beginning.
6465345	6465726	All right.
6465726	6467167	That's it.
6467167	6470811	Well, believe it or not, we had no more long form stories scheduled for tonight.
6470811	6476157	Usually we'd talk about some other stuff after the release dates, but I feel like the news was a little bit abbreviated this week.
6476157	6477499	I'm not sure why.
6477499	6481283	At this time of year, we're not like in spring break season yet or anything, right?
6481283	6484427	This is an odd kind of time of year, I suppose.
6484427	6485268	We're not quite to the
6485988	6492412	Anticipation of summer releases and things like that, but it is overall a relatively quiet week.
6492412	6494393	We will open up, of course, the listener roundtable.
6494393	6501557	If you would like to have any questions for us, you can go ahead and plop those in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6501557	6504038	We do welcome your emails, as always, every week.
6504038	6507520	Participate at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us an email.
6507520	6508981	Oh, excuse me, hiccup.
6508981	6511623	Although I believe we don't have any this week, if I remember right.
6513400	6524330	DarkSakura is ready to fend off the spam bots with a big orange bat that will knock them senseless, so no spam please.
6524330	6528093	S2100mat says media is slow in general because of Oscar season.
6528093	6533258	Serious question and I promise I'm not saying this to be that guy or whatever you want to say.
6533258	6535039	Do people really care about the Oscars that much?
6535720	6549207	like maybe it's just because I've had this obligation on Sunday nights and I just I play more games than I see movies I couldn't even tell you what's nominated this year Oppenheimer the movie that looked really weird with the girl from EZA
6550965	6553206	Those movies were nominated, right?
6553206	6556708	So did Barbie get a Best Picture nom?
6556708	6562171	I know Barbie got nominated for a lot but not Greta Gerwig, which was unfortunate because she probably deserved one.
6562171	6567274	So all right, I guess everyone on my Facebook list is talking about the Oscars.
6567274	6567354	Why?
6570700	6597359	why though spoiler Oppenheimer one best picture I figured because that movie it was a Chris Nolan film right is new the Oscar loves his movies and most of most of the ones I've seen are pretty good like I'm not knocking on Chris Nolan so Barbie won one award did it okay won the song that doesn't surprise that's that song hit hard in that movie I didn't realize the context in the movie and I was like damn this hits hard so does that mean does um
6599525	6600446	Oh, did Billy?
6600446	6602387	Wait, Def says guess which one?
6602387	6604349	Oh, I forgot there were two nominated.
6604349	6606871	Was it not the Billie Eilish song that won?
6606871	6608051	Did the other one win?
6608051	6610673	That's surprising if so.
6610673	6614236	I mean, it was also like the Dua Lipa songs.
6614236	6615237	Really a bop.
6615237	6618039	So okay, Def says it was Billie Eilish.
6618039	6618960	Okay.
6618960	6619620	Okay.
6619620	6621782	But doesn't that didn't she win now back to back?
6621782	6624464	Because didn't she have?
6624464	6626105	Did she have a Bond song last year?
6628177	6628237	and
6659539	6661161	Dammit.
6661161	6666446	I don't know very many Billie Eilish songs, I'll be honest.
6666446	6670169	I don't talk shit about you on the internet.
6670169	6672331	What is that song that Kelly Clarkson covered?
6672331	6674393	It's so good.
6674393	6675174	Happier Than Ever.
6675174	6676435	That's it.
6676435	6678597	That's the one.
6678597	6681099	God, I'm talking like I'm my age now.
6681099	6683181	What is that one thing?
6683181	6683241	But
6684827	6685307	You know what?
6685307	6687329	The thing that did the stuff.
6687329	6688049	What's her name?
6688049	6689590	That William Eyelash.
6689590	6691931	It's just.
6691931	6695113	It's William Eyelash.
6695113	6696814	OK.
6696814	6705179	But but look, it's because, look, I think you kind of choose the art that you consume, you know, and video games are the art that I consume.
6705179	6707600	And so I can talk a lot about video games.
6707600	6708501	It means I can't.
6708501	6711963	But I there's still not enough time to play every video game either.
6711963	6713444	So anyway.
6715294	6718256	I found another Toriyama game just randomly.
6718256	6719898	Oh, what's that?
6719898	6723100	Gogo Ackman.
6723100	6728164	I should also open up the discord as well over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you'd like to give us a call.
6728164	6730385	Podculture says Rob your boomer is showing.
6730385	6732007	I'm not a fucking boomer.
6732007	6735429	I'm a I'm a late Gen X. There's a difference.
6735429	6738592	Gen X is where all the Karens come from for whatever reason.
6740089	6755030	Apparently, though, I don't know, because I believe it's all arbitrary anyway, but they were supposed to have, like, repartitioned what Gen X, what all of those things, like,
6756292	6762777	I don't know, because I think you and I are like in the group that's considered cusp Gen X. Yeah.
6762777	6763718	Or I don't know.
6763718	6766080	Zillennial was that name they were thrown around for a while.
6766080	6766720	Zenial.
6766720	6767461	Zenial or that.
6767461	6767681	Yeah.
6767681	6770203	Well, the name I really liked, I didn't like that name.
6770203	6774006	The name I really liked was there was a publication that called it the Oregon Trail Generation.
6774006	6775727	And I was like, yes, that is it.
6775727	6778329	That is that is the name of this generation.
6778329	6783093	And I identify with that harder than I do Gen X, to be honest.
6783093	6785575	This is considered a micro generation.
6787389	6794574	So it's the micro generation of people on the cusp of Gen X and millennial demographic cohorts.
6794574	6803860	So, uh, and I've seen anywhere between like 1995 through 84 or something like that.
6803860	6806522	So I've seen them even tighter than that.
6806522	6808964	I'm like, whatever X is cooler.
6808964	6813867	I thought I saw something that was like 76 through 85 or something like that as like the Oregon Trail generation.
6815355	6817737	Either way, I'd fall into it, and I'm like, whatever.
6817737	6821019	Thank you for making up a word we don't need.
6821019	6834607	Best name because, of course, we're not talking about the actual Oregon Trail, but of course, we are talking about the computer game that many of us played in the computer lab at school during the day and how we learned to use computers.
6834607	6838109	Yeah.
6838109	6841752	I mean, I think it's like I tell people sometimes is that
6842592	6849698	We had it where we did grow up with the technology as it was growing up.
6849698	6861568	Like I was, I mean, without going into too much detail, I was born like right when the first Apple computer was released, like I think the year after.
6863343	6867904	Um, you know, when Star Wars was released, I was nine months old.
6867904	6868424	Oh, yeah.
6868424	6880546	So all of all of this, you know, technology, we were on that cusp of playing outside and then coming in and playing with our NES.
6880546	6883867	Oh, I remember getting extra cool because we did it all.
6883867	6886587	I remember getting taken to the cheap theater to see.
6886587	6889268	I think it was Return of the Jedi.
6890287	6895190	but I vividly remember seeing Return to Oz as a child on the big screen and let me tell you the trauma
6913894	6915797	I remember reading a book before I saw the movie.
6915797	6918440	I read more books as a kid than I do now.
6932032	6933613	I have the novelization of Spaceballs
6952390	6955851	And I may still have it somewhere in this house.
6955851	6963574	Fun dumb fact, the novelization of Clue the movie is how they know that there was a fourth ending that was deleted and what it was.
6963574	6969576	And they've confirmed all these years later they did shoot it and the director threw it in the trash because he said it was terrible.
6970444	6976805	So, because it was, I, the fourth ending of the Clue movie was literally the butler did it.
6976805	6983667	And he, it goes to this weird thing about he poisoned everybody's drink and now he's in the car, but it's, it's, it's a callback.
6983667	6990488	It's a comedy callback to the dogs in the very, very, very beginning of the movie, because the dogs end up in the car with him and they growl.
6990488	6991968	And that's how it ends.
6991968	6993309	It's, it sounds trashy.
6993309	6994309	It's one of those things.
6994309	6994749	Yeah.
6994749	6995029	Yeah.
6995029	6999430	Better for movie trivia.
6999430	6999530	So.
7000680	7008153	But I even remember, like, because I hadn't seen Alien right when it first came out because I was really too little for that.
7009142	7021972	But, um, I remember having the novelization for it and then watching the movie going, I thought that she found them turning into pods or something.
7021972	7029538	And later on it turned out that, yeah, it was a deleted scene and they added in a recut version for the director's cut of Alien.
7029538	7035863	And then they went, cause it was, I think that's where they came up with the queen concept for Aliens.
7036738	7051779	because that scene didn't end up in the final movie and now they've actually done like this whole how adaptable they are that if there's no queen, they will have people mutate into pods themselves to grow a queen.
7053188	7055389	I feel like novelizations of films were a huge thing.
7055389	7060012	You'd find them all the time at the grocery store in the magazines and stuff.
7060012	7063474	So I feel like I don't know if it's still as big of a thing as it used to be.
7063474	7069418	Well, remember, okay, so we can tie it to video games, because remember, then they kind of tried to do that with video games for a hot minute.
7069418	7071439	There was that whole Worlds of Power, right?
7071439	7078584	Remember the FX9 books with Simon's Quest with Blaster Master, you know, there was there and those books
7079502	7083424	When you were 12 years old were the coolest fucking things.
7083424	7089026	Even though you go back and you look at the plot now, it's like Simon Belmont had like a kid helper.
7089026	7091147	It was really... I don't know the coolest.
7091147	7095688	I don't think the plots have aged very well, but when you were 12, they were awesome.
7095688	7100150	The coolest things were just getting all the cheap books at the Scholastic Book Fairs.
7100150	7101351	That was the coolest thing.
7101351	7102071	Yes, yes.
7103504	7119313	I still to this day remember my favorite like I never I usually read like quote grown-up books that I wasn't supposed to read but I picked up a more age-appropriate book that was called Serendipity.
7120515	7129057	about a girl who was like a princess who daydreams and all this other things and rescues a unicorn and blah, blah, blah.
7129057	7135338	And it turns out that she's just a real girl having a daydream with her horse.
7135338	7142119	It's, but it was a cute little story and I kind of wish I could find another copy of it.
7142119	7142699	All right.
7142699	7144379	Well, we don't have emails.
7144379	7145840	I don't see anybody in the green room.
7145840	7148540	Let me check in with Matt and see if we had any last minute stories tonight.
7150873	7170930	uh i don't necessarily i was just looking at this free um homebrew snes game called dotty flowers it looks sweet sorry this comment gets me too phoenix7726 says also animorphs just saying that shit held up well and is even more fucked up we didn't have those i yeah i feel like
7171630	7173331	We missed that a little bit.
7173331	7175531	Like that was starting to get big when I was in high school.
7175531	7178813	But I remember the Babysitter's Club was a big thing.
7178813	7180994	I also remember what were the- Yeah!
7180994	7183354	What were the horror- was it Fear Street?
7183354	7185775	I feel like there was another one in that.
7185775	7186716	Maybe it was Fear Street.
7186716	7190397	I mean that was- Fear Street was the Goosebumps thing.
7190397	7191377	Goosebumps.
7191377	7192378	That was everywhere too.
7194785	7198767	We had scary stories in the dark.
7198767	7203829	There were these black and white covers because we didn't have goosebumps either.
7203829	7210933	But we had the scary stories to tell in the dark that were like these black and white covers with like a red splash somewhere.
7213164	7217230	Yeah, Animorphs, the thing, but I do want to point out, Animorphs is awesome.
7217230	7222016	The author is a very likable person and has come out in support of very good things.
7222016	7227663	So there's no shame in still loving the Animorphs as an adult.
7227663	7229826	I think that was around high school when those started to take off.
7231027	7232248	Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys
7249085	7249586	but I actually
7265669	7290881	went back and read and purchased two Nancy Drew books that I loved when I was a young teenager and one of them is like this murder mystery thing where she like goes to an opera like she sings in an opera in disguise and that's all I had remembered about it for the longest time and then I had like the team up with Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys
7292987	7294508	Uh, those are the days.
7294508	7299032	Um, I would say the stuff- Sweet Valley High.
7299032	7300033	Oh, Sweet Valley High.
7300033	7300473	Yes.
7300473	7305937	I would say the stuff too I vividly remember as a kid would be the Ramona Quimby books.
7307300	7314363	Beverly Clearly and her whole thing, which she passed away at like the age of 100 relatively recently.
7314363	7315863	Or Judy Blume books.
7315863	7316363	That's it.
7316363	7318764	Judy Blume, Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.
7318764	7320124	I even remember being 11.
7320124	7323966	Here's a book after Superfudge that I never read and I need to find it.
7323966	7328627	I remember reading Are You There, God, It's Me, Margaret when I was 11 years old.
7328627	7329748	And I had a lot of questions.
7329748	7331188	How to Eat Fried Worms.
7331188	7333489	Do you know that she tried to make a male version of that book?
7335103	7335163	and
7366055	7372459	I liked all of the ones um there was another one that had Margaret in the lead though wasn't it
7386478	7390300	Um, did she do one later where she came back to like Margaret as an adult or something?
7390300	7390580	Maybe?
7390580	7391561	I feel like that would have been a thing.
7391561	7392121	I don't remember.
7392121	7394402	I thought for sure there was another one.
7394402	7396883	Well, then she got into adult books later on.
7396883	7403146	I don't think she has written a young adult or a child book in quite some time, to be honest.
7403146	7404066	I need to read.
7404066	7409889	I'll find the name of that one that's after Superfudge.
7409889	7412390	Oh, Frecklejuice was another one.
7412390	7413511	There's Doublefudge.
7414864	7416285	So that was it, Double Fudge.
7416285	7424308	There were five books in the Fudge series because there was Super Fudge, Fudgemania and Double Fudge.
7424308	7424909	Oh, I didn't.
7424909	7432292	Yeah, I didn't read the I think the because I read Tales of Fourth Grade and I think I read Super Fudge, but I didn't read anything other than that.
7432292	7433432	Yeah.
7433432	7438435	So and then also, I did not know if they turned Fudge into a TV series at some point.
7438435	7438935	I didn't know that.
7439557	7440898	Yeah, they did.
7440898	7443781	Oh wow, Doublefoot came out in 2002?
7443781	7444702	Are you there God?
7444702	7445963	It's me, Margaret.
7445963	7447444	Finally got turned into a film.
7447444	7448485	Finally.
7448485	7449306	Last year.
7449306	7452028	Did you know they did a movie version of that like last year?
7452028	7460116	I think that kind of like... Yeah, I know that they did, but I never saw it.
7462242	7464643	OddCulture says Encyclopedia Brown.
7464643	7465783	Yeah, I remember that.
7465783	7466604	I remember something.
7466604	7473586	What was the one she would close her eyes and say click and she had a photographic memory and she could remember things and it helped her?
7473586	7476928	Maybe this is... Oh, I remember from the mixed up files of Ms.
7476928	7480109	Basil E. Frankweiler.
7480109	7482590	Where the two kids run away from home to live in the Met.
7483513	7507697	Okay, which Okay, to bring it back and to close it out on a video game topic since we are you know, supposedly a video game show, which of these young adult reminiscing seer which of these young adult books would make the best video game which which book from your youth would make the best video game?
7507697	7509857	This is a hard one.
7509857	7510718	Hmm.
7510718	7512718	I don't know.
7512718	7512778	Um,
7515731	7518172	I can't really think of a ton.
7518172	7524435	I would say, um, uh, Bunnicula.
7524435	7526556	I don't know.
7526556	7527796	Phoenix says Animorphs.
7527796	7529837	That's a, that's a pretty good, some of them.
7529837	7531098	There's already Animorph games.
7531098	7531938	It doesn't count.
7531938	7534159	I was just, well, also like I would say, oh, Nancy Drew.
7534159	7534719	Oh yeah, duh.
7534719	7542063	They have a whole series of games that she's been in, but you know, those types of like crime solving games, I think would be very, very good.
7542063	7542863	Um,
7544915	7546695	Maybe something.
7546695	7552236	I'm going to say The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein for no particular reason.
7552236	7552936	That's my answer.
7552936	7555197	I'm sticking to it.
7555197	7556837	All right.
7556837	7557677	That's it.
7557677	7558517	We're going to wrap up.
7558517	7560158	We're out of here for the night.
7560158	7563758	Thank you all so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week.
7563758	7564519	What?
7564519	7565439	I just had a thought.
7565439	7565759	What's that?
7565759	7572060	Speaking of Silverstein, what if they did like a visual novel version of A Boy Named Sue?
7572060	7572420	Why not?
7575160	7580822	And your purpose is to go around and beat people up to find out where your dad is so you can kick his ass.
7580822	7582543	All right, we're gonna wrap up though.
7582543	7583223	We're done.
7583223	7583983	We're out of here.
7583983	7585784	Thank you as always for listening to Orange Zaunage Radio.
7585784	7589385	Thank you for listening to us, whether it was on the podcast feed or live.
7589385	7591406	We really appreciate you all being here.
7591406	7592446	Help us spread the word.
7592446	7595687	Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7595687	7597248	We need more voices to put out here on air.
7597688	7599249	Episode 1000 is around the corner.
7599249	7601211	It's a really good excuse to get new people to come in.
7601211	7602692	So we appreciate it.
7602692	7607015	A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you found the show goes a long way.
7607015	7613859	By the way, somebody left a Spotify note this last week that just said woke and gay.
7613859	7615340	If you remember last week's show.
7616397	7617537	And of course I approved it.
7617537	7619358	We are woke and gay.
7619358	7621998	So, uh, so they, they, sure.
7621998	7625699	If you want to leave that fine, I don't care as long as it has five stars by it.
7625699	7628260	Uh, and it's, it's funny and it makes sense.
7628260	7631240	Um, but anyway, in all seriousness, thank you for supporting.
7631240	7632180	Appreciate it.
7632180	7633861	Uh, we'll be back to do it all again in seven days.
7633861	7635441	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
7635441	7638262	I believe DarkSakura, you said you were not streaming tonight.
7638262	7642903	So, um, sorry kids, but we'll raid somebody else in a moment here.
7644743	7654766	To speak for myself on this, I have my other toenail done, and I have a back sprain that I'm still healing from.
7654766	7662768	So, I intend to be on medications, which does not make, I mean, it might make for interesting gameplay, but certainly not for Dead by Daylight.
7662768	7668129	I'll be like, ooh, I'm gonna make friends with the, I'm dead.
7668129	7668489	So, yeah.
7671547	7672328	Take it away, David.
7672328	7673228	I will.
7673228	7674289	I'll play on Tuesday.
7674289	7676691	All right.
7676691	7679172	Loki, I see what you linked there in chat.
7679172	7680273	You got your merch store.
7680273	7681194	Is that what you want to plug?
7681194	7681854	Yeah, that's right.
7681854	7685437	I was going to plug the merch store that I've got now.
7685437	7689300	So lokiolr.printify.me.
7689300	7692242	And I think it's also linked in the Discord as well.
7692242	7695024	Merch shirt.
7695024	7695344	All right.
7696223	7698024	Get him if you like him, don't if you don't.
7698024	7698825	That's fine.
7698825	7699945	I don't care either way.
7699945	7705389	Well, sadly, no, no merch store for me to plug here, but I will plug.
7705389	7711693	Hey, if you happen to be local in the Sacramento area, I am hosting an event at the Colonial on April 27th.
7711693	7712794	It's going to be a lot of fun.
7712794	7715235	Burlesque, variety, all that good stuff.
7715235	7717157	Tickets are available at lovehorrorevents.com.
7717157	7718978	So I guess I will plug that for myself.
7718978	7721880	So an in-person sighting, if you will.
7721880	7724982	But I am looking forward more to more in-person conventions and things like that.
