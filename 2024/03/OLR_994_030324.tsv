9884	10845	Kids these days.
10845	13686	Back in my day, we didn't have the world's information in our hands at all times.
13686	19870	We only had to deal with bomb drills and sometimes threats, and have our friend come to our car in the high school parking lot and tell us a plane hit the World Trade Center.
19870	27594	We didn't have to deal with doxing, swatting, and even greater threat of school shootings, nor being bullied for not having rare or expensive Fortnite skins.
27594	29275	This is the We Live In A Society intro.
29275	34598	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about kids these days and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34598	36719	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,
39500	41061	Wow, this episode is gonna be dark.
41061	42801	Hi everybody out there on the internet.
42801	47363	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47363	50144	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50144	60348	We are live and back after a week off once again with episode number 994 of our show tonight for March the 3rd of 2024.
60348	67811	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm feeling refreshed and relaxed after being gone on a cruise last week.
68391	75775	I'm back here tonight to talk about video games with you all with my pals that join me every week, weekend and week out.
75775	78957	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
78957	79777	Sup?
79777	80938	Sup?
80938	83159	How are you doing?
83159	83239	Um,
84221	85241	I'm all right.
85241	89123	I actually threw out my back last week.
89123	94805	And I've been on a kind of semi reclining rest.
94805	97747	So I've actually started feeling better.
97747	103009	I've been able to get back to doing at least like some of my PT stuff for my back physical therapy.
103989	107070	and I've become addicted to a game I'll tell you about in a bit.
107070	108471	Ooh, can't wait to hear.
108471	112172	Well, I hope you're able to make the most of the OLR not happening last week.
112172	114993	Hopefully that wasn't the same time you threw out your back and you were able to enjoy yourself.
114993	116593	That was right after I threw out my back.
116593	117714	Oh, oh, well.
117714	121615	Well, at least, hey, it gave you an opportunity to rest up for the night, I guess.
121615	125216	Well, let's also check in with the one and only Techmaster Loki.
125216	125756	Hello.
125756	126496	Hi.
126496	127737	Did you enjoy a week off, Loki?
129632	131554	I mean it was a week off.
146952	161408	It's not great internet is kind of weird like in my stateroom I don't know if it was because of where we were located on the boat or whatever it did not work very well it was very hard for very slow like I could get internet but it was crappy but when I was out and about especially
162189	170552	on the sun deck, you know, deck 11, which, you know, you're outside at that point, it worked great, which I mean, of course, satellite data, there's a lot to be said about that.
170552	173193	But But of course, it's not my phone directly on the satellite.
173193	177754	So anyway, but for whatever reason, it worked outdoors, much better than did in my stateroom.
177754	179675	And that's I saw a push notification come in.
179675	181676	And I was like, Oh, yeah, Loki is going to be live today.
181676	187598	But sorry, I didn't try to watch because on demand video is a lot for cruise ship.
187598	187818	Right?
187818	188418	I imagine.
188418	189359	Yeah.
189359	190159	But did you have a good stream?
190839	192339	Yeah, it was all right.
192339	193440	Took down trees.
193440	194600	Oh, there you go.
194600	195720	Fun, fun.
195720	199882	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says it's Starlink on Royal Caribbean.
199882	203523	It is and I I did not realize that because they call it something else.
203523	206244	So I didn't realize that until after I'd already bought it.
206244	206824	And then I was like,
208424	212106	Can't believe I gave that guy's company any money at all.
212106	223251	But you can't really put a price on being able to access the blink cameras and get pictures of your cats whenever you need them, which is the actual reason why we get internet on the cruise ship.
223251	227553	Because I know there's some people out there that would say, why do you need internet on a cruise ship?
227553	229954	You're on vacation, stay off the internet.
229954	232755	Nope, we need the internet to check in on cats.
232755	234776	That is, that is it.
234776	234916	So
236308	237069	That's why it's needed.
237069	240792	But thankfully, technology will allow you to do that.
240792	246016	So, well, I hope everybody had a great week off and had some good gaming.
246016	250920	I know there's been a lot of big stuff that's come out in the last couple weeks, especially Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
250920	252961	We will talk about our gaming weeks in just a moment.
252961	255383	I will talk more about my cruise as well.
255383	258065	I know Bobby Blackwolf teased a story on last week's show.
258065	260928	I don't even know if my co-hosts know what happened, but I will share kind of a
262244	264725	a pretty deep thing that happened on the cruise this last week.
264725	266866	I'm going to talk about that during gaming weeks.
266866	279772	But since this is a video game podcast, let's get into the actual gaming news, which unfortunately, this this is the broken record story that just won't go away as much as we want it to.
279772	287615	And Loki, would you mind taking the reins here and telling us about another really unfortunate situation this week to start us off?
288533	296736	Uh, so yeah, so Sony is reducing their staff by about 900 people or 8% of their workforce.
296736	304639	Uh, this was announced by Jim Ryan, um, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.
304639	310521	It's going to, uh, also as a result of that, multiple games have been canceled as well.
310521	311502	Some of those like,
312541	319349	It's a lot of them were like live service games and some we've already kind of heard about that were being canceled.
319349	325576	Like, for example, the I think it was the Last of Us live service game was one of them.
328004	333325	I don't remember some of the other ones, but a lot of the ones I heard were like live service type of games.
333325	336766	Didn't they go from like they had said 10 live service games at one point?
336766	337786	Now they're like five.
337786	338926	I remember that being a thing.
338926	339707	Something like that.
339707	339887	Yeah.
339887	344187	We heard about these layoffs is that they were going to reduce the number of those games.
344187	344748	Yeah.
344748	349249	And then what was it also?
349249	352169	You know, London Studio, I know, was affected by that as well.
352169	354550	I think they closed the whole studio down, if I remember correctly.
356820	359422	But yeah, that sucks.
359422	362504	And I guarantee this is not going to be the last.
362504	363886	And it just seems to be the trend.
363886	368389	Just all these gaming companies laying off a bunch of people.
368389	371311	And then, of course, you have the other side of that, which we'll get into later.
371311	378117	But a lot of these gaming companies have really talented people, and they go on to form their own independent studios that do great things.
379690	387873	But that's not going to be as much as I've tried to say that as a, you know, that sometimes out of these crappy situations come diamonds.
387873	393136	The reality is that's not going to be not everybody's in a situation to be able to make their dream indie game.
393136	397237	And that's just not going to be the reality for a lot of people.
397237	403440	Unfortunately, some people are going to leave more than some people are going to end up leaving the gaming industry and going into, I don't know, banking.
403840	404340	Microsoft Layoffs
423866	437398	And I seem to remember that, you know, we heard that the federal government was going to come after Microsoft for that because, well, you said in your Activision Blizzard acquisition, remember, the government still wants to stop the Activision Blizzard acquisition by Microsoft.
437398	439079	It's too late, isn't it?
439079	440540	It really is.
440540	443963	But they still want to stop it at this point.
443963	451630	And if they really want to, like, stop things from merging that have merged like already after a long period of time, can we like
452677	452877	do it.
467737	470379	I want the government to go after the Willy Wonka experience too.
470379	473002	I don't care that that was in Europe.
473002	481549	Actually, no, you laugh, but I do think the government needs to do something about the AI ads misrepresenting.
481549	485392	If you haven't seen the meme about the Wonka experience, it's everywhere right now.
485392	487314	It's so big I even read about it on Blue Sky.
487794	498707	It doesn't even have to be like an AI ad, it just, it's just, the AI part is not even necessarily a part of it, aside from like, it just like, yeah, but it's false advertising.
498707	503133	Things get misrepresented all the time, but AI makes it easier to falsely advertise.
503899	517881	I very recently on BlueSky and the TWAT site posted a video from the Wall Street Journal on how to spot AI content, video content.
518897	520918	Oh, AI video content.
520918	521518	Interesting.
521518	528462	I always feel like it's referring back to the the new Sage thing that's being put out by the ChatGTP people.
528462	531464	I always still feel like I can tell.
531464	533845	I haven't done a lot with video, though, to be honest.
533845	536126	But at least the pictures, I feel like it's it's odd.
536126	542989	And the thing that really annoys me is that on Facebook all the time, people do this shit on Facebook for clout reposts.
542989	545191	And it works because I see my friends doing it.
545191	547472	For example, I just saw one today that was like,
548412	556058	It was a picture of a pretend Mummy 4 poster, like another Mummy movie with Brendan Fraser, which I think a lot of us would like to see.
556058	562502	I don't know if they've actually confirmed one or not, but this site is posting the poster like it's the real poster.
562502	568086	And if that is happening, I guarantee you they haven't shot a single frame of it, nor they've taken a promo photo.
568086	573891	I get a ton of those, a ton of those where they will fake AI movie posters.
573891	576352	It's so infuriating that like people
577613	579934	Well, and it's also sad that people fall for it constantly.
579934	583295	But anyway, I tried to go back to Facebook and it didn't last.
583295	585076	It lasted like three weeks.
585076	586477	I honestly, I don't blame you.
586477	588177	There's just a lot on social media that's irritating.
588177	592559	But anyway, we're digressing a little bit from what the story is about the layoffs.
592559	598861	And I was talking about Microsoft and, you know, how the government was going to, you know, use this as additional ammo in their campaign.
598861	600382	I actually kind of think
601434	610599	This PlayStation thing now kind of ends that argument because now Microsoft can simply point and say our biggest competitor in this space has done the same thing.
610599	614501	This is an industry epidemic, not something as a result of the buyout.
614501	617043	And I think the government's case is done with that.
617603	618645	Thank you for watching!
633803	634003	Nintendo
652935	656717	So far in this wave, we're not hearing anything.
656717	674705	And then of course you you can't help but think when presented with you can't help but think of Satoru Iwata when he was with us and how he took the pay cut and the other executives took the pay cut because the Wii U underperformed and they did the pay cut as opposed to doing layoffs.
674705	680248	And it's it's hard not to have that be front of mind in light of everything that's going on right now.
680948	701992	and yes to acknowledge what's being said in chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show E3VL says Nintendo work culture is different especially in Japan pay cut is normal in Japanese culture yes but unfortunately as of now
704332	708255	And I say as of now because I think there's a lot of people getting pissed off about this.
708255	712498	It may not be a thing in the next few years, but I think this will be a thing in our lifetime.
712498	713960	It's not a thing in American culture.
714912	716533	But I think you're going to hear more thing.
716533	719775	I think you're really starting to see a push for a lot of people are sick and tired of it.
719775	730403	And you're going to hear a push for things like maximum wage, and you know, severely taxing those that profit off of these systems that I there's a whole other soapbox for that.
730403	732805	And a lot of podcasts talking about that.
732805	738309	But the those tea leaves and everything reading that will absolutely trickle down into the gaming industry.
739363	768681	I mean, look at how much Bobby Kotick, who had a hand in ruining this industry, look at how much he walked away with and tell me that the vast majority of, I'm gonna say decent gamers, meaning people that don't, you know, just shitpost on Twitter all day and all this stuff, the massive bulk of decent gamers aren't in some way pissed off and see the injustice in Bobby, or Bobby Kotick, I almost said Bobby Blackwolf, I'm sorry, Bobby, but I was reading chat.
769742	773524	Bobby Kotick walking away with all that money.
773524	775425	Bobby Blackwolf deserves a raise for the record.
775425	781707	I just want to be very clear on the difference between the two Bobbies.
781707	795473	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf, though, does plan this was the comment I was reading that caused me to almost say his name in place of the other Bobby saying Sony didn't lay off any of their Japanese employees, only their US, UK and Europe employees.
795473	796594	That is interesting.
797936	802603	Let's go back to that for a minute because I find the Sony changes in Europe very interesting.
802603	806508	I think a lot of us are sitting here looking at all this news that's happening going, why?
807893	808873	Why?
808873	811094	And this is the this is the big question, right?
811094	815055	I think if we had all the answers to this, maybe we could in some way stop this.
815055	816336	But why?
816336	824318	And certainly I'm looking at like Sony London, knowing that they did a lot with VR.
824318	831080	Am I am I incorrect in thinking pretty much all the first party Sony VR stuff came out of Sony London?
831080	837002	Unless maybe I know there was a few things at least that came out of Sony London for VR, even on the original PlayStation VR.
837301	842144	I'm trying to think of some of the other like conceptual things, um, came out of a different zoo.
842144	846026	I think for some, I think Sony London was pretty heavily involved with that.
846026	856433	And I, you know, again, I'm trying not to read too much into it, but I can't help but feel like Sony is not really talking about PSVR 2.
856433	858334	I don't know.
858334	861716	And I always said from the beginning, it's, you know, it's a nice piece of tech,
862864	865267	But it doesn't have the must-have game.
865267	869031	It doesn't have the fun factor to justify the prize.
869031	874417	I hear that there's a possibility that they're going to try to get that to work with PC as well.
874417	875378	That's huge.
875378	878041	If that happens, that would be amazing.
878041	881065	That would be amazing and that's how they can save that really good tech.
882202	882302	is
909821	911461	I think it's a lot of factors.
911461	927185	I think some could say COVID plays into it and I think maybe people projected a larger space for games and that, you know, being online together type of thing in COVID and everything that happened in 2020.
927185	933107	And I think maybe it lost sight of the fact that most people wanted to go back to the way it was before.
933387	943913	Of course, there's always going to still be people that, you know, are thrilled about how tech, well, I'm wording this poorly because of course, we're all thrilled that technology allows us to, you know, connect across great distances and all that.
943913	949156	And the way Zoom's taken off, it's not just for, you know, nerds anymore and all that stuff and comparable platforms.
949156	962424	But I think the gaming industry may have thought there was going to be a bigger space for online games that doesn't really exist because people are, for better or for worse, whatever you want to call it, going back to normal at this point.
963399	973565	So, you know, and especially with the CDC recommendations this week change, you know, really, we're just all over COVID at this point as a society, and it's going back to the way it was.
973565	979849	So and I think people's spending habits are reflecting that, but I don't think that's the sole thing to blame either.
979849	982811	I think what's really to blame.
982811	988094	I think every game thinks it can be Pokemon Go.
988094	988575	That's it.
988575	990176	Every game thinks it can be Pokemon Go.
991187	1002954	Every CEO, every game developer, every person that's trying to make a game, every games as a service, everything is trying to be Pokemon Go.
1002954	1010298	And I get it, you can say what you will about Pokemon Go specifically, but I don't want you to think that specifically.
1010298	1017922	I'm using that as the everybody knows that example type of massive market appeal type of game.
1019110	1026463	that was able to drive the types of microtransactions that people are willing to pay.
1026463	1033415	And because people are willing to pay it in a game like Pokemon Go and a very specific subset of other games.
1034636	1042542	people are trying to slap that constantly print the money mechanic of Pokemon Go into every game.
1042542	1043502	And I think we know that.
1043502	1048546	We've seen the explosion of games as a service and battle passes in games.
1048546	1049387	Why do they need it?
1049387	1058533	Like Diablo four and you know, other, other types of, you know, DLC and cosmetic things that are ridiculous, ridiculously priced and so forth.
1058533	1059354	And, um,
1059694	1061235	Niantic NBA All World
1076377	1084584	because they thought people would want to do the Pokemon Go model in the NBA thing, and I'll tell you why that game fucking sucked.
1084584	1088507	And I say this as somebody who loves AR gaming and does an awful lot of it.
1088507	1092671	NBA All-World fucking sucked because at its core, it was a really shitty
1093715	1095555	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1123154	1136376	Well, that's also more of the reason, too, why they should be, you know, well, first off, not green lighting all of these live service games, because, you know, like Pokemon Go, that takes up a certain amount of time.
1136376	1138237	Like you cannot play.
1138237	1142717	I mean, usually you're not playing multiple games at the same time.
1142717	1150879	I mean, passively, maybe you can, but like actively playing these games, you only have time to play maybe one or two of them or something like that.
1152659	1155621	create 10 new live service games.
1155621	1158944	Sony, like you have a live service game, Destiny.
1158944	1162506	You're just cannibalizing yourself at this point.
1162506	1165608	Like you're obviously they're not all going to be successful.
1165608	1171173	And you know, if history shows us recently, even most of them are not.
1171173	1172534	And a lot of them are crap.
1172534	1175216	So like, you know, maybe don't do that.
1176328	1185156	Yeah, there's some really shitty calls happening in the gaming industry at the top levels of what games should we be making.
1185156	1193104	And at its core, I think what's driving a lot of these layoffs is the realization of maybe we shouldn't be making these games.
1193104	1193304	Oops.
1194713	1210542	and now frontline workers and hardworking artists, programmers, PR types of folks are paying the price because somebody at the top thought they could make the next money printing game just by making it.
1210542	1211603	And that's simply not true.
1213004	1220530	I will say though, and I'm not going to repeat too much of what he said on his show, because I'll forge you over to Bobby Blackwolf's show, because he's on before us live.
1220530	1232959	I thought he had a really interesting take on this, and I thought he was really right on, so I do kind of want to repeat it, but he was talking a little bit about how in this day and age, you have these very, very, very large budget games.
1233499	1236260	Final Fantasy VII Rebirth just came out this week, right?
1236260	1239302	Think about how many millions of dollars that game take to make.
1239302	1245424	And think about how many millions of dollars these other large AAA games take to make.
1245424	1249946	And the industry can't substantiate all of these AAA games.
1249946	1253348	The games that tend to succeed are the ones that are made with smaller teams.
1253348	1259531	And if you go back in the day to the Atari 2600 days, it took one person to make a lot of those games.
1260712	1266037	Howard Scott Warshaw programmed ET for better or worse by himself.
1266037	1269800	Art, music, game design, all of it by himself.
1271690	1274012	and David Crane, Pitfall, etc, etc.
1274012	1283221	The story goes on, you know, there were, to be fair to the folks in the 80s, there were, of course, people involved with PR, making the instruction manual, but I think you get my point.
1283221	1286443	You made a big game with a lot less people back in those days.
1286443	1290367	And then those games, when adjusting for inflation, those games were selling for like $90.
1294022	1296268	So, maybe even more, honestly.
1296268	1298374	Bobby gave some of the exact figures on his show.
1298374	1300399	But you know what I mean when we're talking about inflation, right?
1300399	1302765	What used to cost $50 back in the day costs a lot more now.
1304253	1308496	and now- I like what Bad Culture said too.
1308496	1310957	Oh, in chat over at twitch.tv.
1310957	1313719	I'm just going to repeat it because it's a joke.
1313719	1315340	Massive amounts of Coke.
1315340	1315960	That's right.
1315960	1318501	They consume so much Coca-Cola.
1318501	1321583	It just, you know, made Coke what it is today.
1321583	1323664	Which is true.
1323664	1323944	It's true.
1323944	1331629	And I'm not going to pick on this particular individual, but how do you think people met those six week deadlines on those games?
1333268	1337215	Drinking all that delicious Coca-Cola beverage product.
1337215	1338477	And cocaine.
1338477	1339839	Lots of cocaine.
1339839	1341722	Just gonna throw that out there.
1341722	1342964	There it is.
1342964	1345708	Questbuster always... They went on an 8-ball bender.
1346394	1356259	QuestBuster always points out, and this is correct too, to piggyback on what Rob is saying, back then selling 50 or 100K copies of a game for the PC was considered monumental.
1356259	1357020	And so on and so on.
1357020	1359081	And I think, you know, you guys get the point.
1359081	1363183	And again, I want to point at Bobby's show because I think he framed it very well and so forth.
1363183	1368445	And I would hope you're listening to both of our shows because, you know, I want to support all our pals here at VOG Network.
1368445	1372968	But at the end of the day, what it boils down to is that
1374551	1387158	All these companies want to make these very expensive games because they see them printing money like Pokemon Go, but the reality is Pokemon Go is something that happens once in a blue moon, or a Fortnite, you name it.
1387158	1389139	I know I keep coming back to Pokemon Go, but fine.
1389139	1392100	Fortnite, you know, the games that have been successful with it.
1392100	1394421	I was even dead by daylight on the Battle Pass front.
1394421	1395162	Actually, that game...
1395782	1402185	for what it is and the budget that that game was likely made on very well and very long running for that format.
1402185	1410308	But we all know for every Dead by Daylight, there's been easily 20 other horror games flopping.
1410308	1422374	It feels like a lot of it, like if you are focusing, obviously you want to be profitable as a company, but if what you're looking at is I'm looking to make money instead of I'm looking to make a game,
1423334	1427555	then you're going to get garbage is what you're going to get.
1427555	1433477	Well, you know, the video game industry and the movie industry often a lot more related than we'd like to think.
1433477	1437958	And I'm not just talking literally about how like a lot of great TV shows right now are based on video games.
1437958	1441720	I mean, where the movie industry tends to go, the video game industry tends to go.
1441720	1448822	This has been, if there's been one of a few themes that have come up in the 22 years we've been doing this show,
1450049	1451129	That's one of the big ones.
1451129	1454311	Where the movie industry goes, the video games tend to follow.
1454311	1455371	And you know what?
1455371	1459452	The movie industry is suffering a similar problem right now.
1459452	1466735	They're dealing with it in very different ways, but there's also a lot of layoffs happening, I want to say, with all the write-offs.
1466735	1469496	Didn't Warner Brothers actually lay off a bunch of people recently, too?
1469496	1470817	One of those companies did.
1470817	1473037	Sorry, somebody in chat will correct me, I'm sure.
1473037	1473718	Yay, internet.
1473718	1476979	But what I wanted to talk about was all these streaming services.
1477984	1485146	All these streaming services making these big budget productions, big budget productions.
1485146	1487927	And what is the movie industry now learning?
1487927	1492729	People don't want to subscribe to all of these fucking streaming services.
1492729	1504993	And it might not be profitable to make all of these big budget productions because people aren't going to go to a service necessarily just for one thing or they're going to watch it and then they're going to cancel it or so on.
1504993	1506914	It's probably a better idea
1507915	1509056	Paramount Plus and Peacock
1530826	1533167	if they actually were to combine.
1533167	1534148	So I'm all for Mt.
1534148	1534988	Cock.
1534988	1537349	A service with Drag Race and the traitors?
1537349	1537910	Sure.
1537910	1540311	But anyway, all joking aside about Mt.
1540311	1540551	Cock.
1542426	1548849	I feel like this is sadly through these layoffs where we see the game industry may actually be going.
1548849	1550150	It's hard to tell just yet.
1550150	1556153	I'm not willing to give the credit to the CEO of the gaming industries that they're getting it right.
1556153	1557854	I'm not willing to give that credit yet.
1557854	1559995	And I think we're years off from seeing that.
1559995	1561996	But I think the gaming industry is starting to realize
1562916	1576649	We need to be able to make smaller games that move a profitable amount of copies other than putting all of our money into games that will forever print money and then fucking shit the bed when they're released.
1576649	1583435	Well, and that's also kind of I think why we may see this move to more multi-platform stuff because you look at it like
1584176	1595747	Sure, you want to get people in on your, you know, if you're Sony or Microsoft, you want them in on your, you know, ecosystem, but you're not profitable on consoles.
1595747	1599631	Like, I don't think you really care about selling consoles or not.
1599631	1601492	So if you could just get your products
1602233	1606715	wherever people are playing games, then that's a win-win for you.
1606715	1616220	Certainly, though, if you're looking to get more of the money, buying a certain platform, for example, that's where they have those exclusives.
1616220	1621023	But I don't know if those are necessarily paying as much dividends as they used to.
1621023	1630068	So we may see a lot of these things go either exclusive for a short period of time or start really branching out multi-platform.
1630748	1639035	PC, maybe even other consoles, you know, especially if we see Microsoft having success with that, with what they're doing.
1639035	1645601	Sony's already experimented with that a little bit with MLB, but I don't think this is the end of that for sure.
1646677	1649780	reading some comments in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1649780	1655144	There's a lot of comments about release Coyote versus Acme and Batgirl, damn it, says PodCulture.
1655144	1657246	Bobby said the first comment there.
1657246	1660568	E3VL talking about Netflix having crossover content recently.
1660568	1665192	There's a lot of those streaming services are picking up international shows too, which is a big, big thing.
1665192	1666593	But this comment made me laugh.
1666593	1673378	DarkTosuya in chat said, I would be okay that we have Paramount Plus through Walmart and wouldn't mind subbing to the cock.
1674502	1676028	using apostrophe cock.
1677042	1681884	Peacock, you are missing a brilliant marketing opportunity.
1681884	1690086	You could have these ads with like all of these very overtly heterosexual men talking about, yeah, man, are you subbing to the cock?
1690086	1695668	Let's go over to Matt's house tonight because he's got the cock and they could do, it could be this whole thing.
1695668	1698169	And then they're going over there to watch what?
1698169	1704751	Football games that are streamed on Peacock, WWF, and all the very manly things that you can only find on the cock.
1705757	1708782	here's the problem is what is peacock doing?
1708782	1720200	macho little man babies would flip their lid they're like oh my god they're trying to make me woke and gay i can't have this like it just you made me think about cocks oh no
1721321	1722843	Now I am gay!
1722843	1725745	Oh, those liberals, dammit, they've done it again!
1725745	1727707	You know, like, it's... that's the problem.
1727707	1729649	That's the society we live in.
1729649	1740719	If it was, like, the 1990s or something like that, sure, like, that type of joke would be perfectly fine on television, but, uh, unfortunately, people are too, like... I don't know.
1740719	1741940	Uptight, I guess.
1741940	1743041	I'm sorry.
1743041	1745604	You know, I-I just... I can't help but think about...
1746539	1750704	All these panels I've done over the years talking about podcasts at places like DragonCon and stuff.
1750704	1763658	And I always, I always tell people when you're going to start a podcast, you need to think about not just the name of your podcast, but you need to think about what is going to make your podcast different from, and I swear there's a point here, what's going to make your podcast different from other podcasts.
1763658	1766902	And you should always have that movie poster line.
1767262	1767562	right?
1767562	1773626	There's always that movie poster line under the name, you know, like Poltergeist, they're here is like the little thing, right?
1773626	1775708	You always have that little line under it, right?
1775708	1780951	And how much do I believe now the line that should be under Orange Lounge Radio is woke and gay?
1780951	1792079	I've heard
1794335	1795595	to our channel tags.
1795595	1795956	Yeah.
1795956	1798416	Woke and gay.
1798416	1811741	DarkSakura, what would you say, if you could, if you could summarize the secret to having a very successful 22 year long running podcast in just three words, what three words would you pick?
1811741	1812601	Two words.
1812601	1813201	What?
1813201	1816302	Shrug emoji.
1816302	1818023	I pitched you the perfect setup.
1818023	1818723	Swing and a miss.
1818723	1819263	That's all right.
1819263	1821224	Woke and gay.
1821224	1821564	All right.
1821564	1823525	Woke and gay.
1823525	1823805	Yeah.
1825259	1827100	I don't know.
1827100	1833745	Anyway, uh, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1833745	1839989	Tigerclaw says Walmart buying Vizio means that you'll see a lot of Walmart advertisements on those TVs plastered everywhere.
1839989	1841910	Oh, and there's gonna get video games.
1841910	1842431	Same thing.
1842431	1845873	That's how they make some of the money back ads and gamings and all that stuff.
1845873	1847014	Yeah, yeah, all of it.
1847014	1847374	All of it.
1848137	1849498	All right.
1849498	1855024	Anyway, it sucks that these layoffs are happening.
1855024	1856646	I hope it's not the end of it.
1856646	1858748	Unfortunately, it's not the end of it.
1858748	1864533	I think as much as I've been talking about, oh, Nintendo's been to me, I think we'll probably hear something on that front.
1864533	1865454	I hope not.
1865454	1868037	But I'm going to just accept the reality.
1868037	1868818	It's probably coming.
1869611	1877553	I would imagine that these will die down after the end of March.
1877553	1878934	Fiscal year.
1878934	1879774	Fiscal year.
1879774	1887136	I think they're trying to pad the numbers a bit to make them look more profitable than they are by doing these layoffs.
1887136	1895178	And I think once they've passed that mark and they've given the numbers to their investors that it should calm down a little bit for a few months.
1895178	1898059	But like, you know, eventually they'll have to deal with reality again.
1899482	1900983	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1924033	1927794	My gaming week was a little blue.
1927794	1931996	It was a little blue.
1931996	1938238	I'll get a little bit more into that, but basically...
1940079	1943080	I, of course, I played Dead by Daylight.
1943080	1949721	And I played some Genshin Impact.
1949721	1958103	But I played something else that has significantly taken up my attention.
1958103	1964184	What that thing is is Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora.
1964184	1964885	Okay.
1964885	1966825	And honestly,
1968772	1971694	I freaking love it.
1971694	1977458	It's... It's really just... I don't really...
1979161	1981903	I don't really have a way to describe it.
1981903	1992090	It's got all of the exploration and puzzling of, you know, like, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
1992090	2005078	And it has a lot more of the realism and kinda combat-y stuff for folks who like to play those combat-y games, you know?
2005078	2005679	It's, uh...
2008876	2015644	And for me, you know, I like sort of, I've been trying to think of how I like, how I say it was sort of like the artificial sociology.
2015644	2017306	Does that make sense?
2017306	2022713	You know, like created cultures and things like that.
2022713	2023994	I have to say I,
2025345	2027187	I really got into it.
2027187	2029789	Those are the kinds of things that I like in a game.
2029789	2042539	And it took all of my favorite things that I liked in the movies and just smashed them all into one thing and it's really, really freaking pretty.
2042539	2046042	Like, I can't get over it.
2046042	2047864	And I've sat and played
2048911	2049232	DarkSakura
2063045	2064846	I just really don't know what to say.
2064846	2067588	It's just been really nice.
2067588	2068849	No, I mean, really fun.
2068849	2073351	If nothing else, like even I still haven't haven't even seen the second Avatar movie.
2073351	2075833	But one thing I know about Avatar, it's pretty.
2075833	2077694	And sometimes you want to play a video game.
2077694	2078114	Why?
2078114	2079294	Because it's pretty.
2079294	2086599	And I get there's probably more in-depth stuff, especially for somebody who I know you were a fan of the first movie and so forth, you know, and all of that.
2087219	2091223	There's, yeah, there's a lot of there's probably a lot of lore and things to unpack.
2091223	2095947	So it's but it's it's also pretty, you know, so I think there's there's a lot of that.
2095947	2098889	Questbuster in chat says Avatar Frontiers is still on my list.
2098889	2100711	I love open box sandboxes.
2100711	2114743	And yeah, I think especially with that particular IP, and the reason why a lot of people are drawn to Avatar, I think an open box sandbox in that universe is really what, you know, there's there's certain people that are really looking for that a lot of people.
2117136	2121553	SSJ100 says sometimes a shiny comes along and distracts you from your main quest.
2122887	2131589	That happens a lot, but what I like about it is that you also don't really necessarily have, like, A-level systems, per se.
2131589	2139912	You discover things that increase your health, you upgrade your armor, so a little bit more realistic as to how well you do.
2139912	2145593	You know, you find better craftsmen or better quality materials to craft with.
2145593	2145753	And...
2147734	2153519	But I like doing all of the, like, clan things.
2153519	2163187	And, like, my brain is just, like, has been, like, super, like, I want more story for the character I'm playing, you know?
2163187	2165168	I want to give her a name, for example.
2165168	2174756	I want to, you know, they just call her by her clan name, which, you know, she and these other kids that were kidnapped are the only people left.
2175817	2184459	So, I mean, it could be she or he or they or whatever you want, but I've just, I've been just all over the place.
2184459	2188500	They had a non-binary Navi in the game.
2188500	2189901	I thought that was cool.
2189901	2193101	And didn't treat it like it was anything special, you know.
2193101	2194502	They just said, oh, they are here.
2194502	2195482	And when you talk to them,
2195962	2198063	You can't tell.
2198063	2199564	You know.
2199564	2205607	They seem really androgynous to me.
2205607	2208649	And I thought that was handled well.
2208649	2216573	And like, if you try to go to a place that maybe is at the boundary or something, they have a legitimate reason for it.
2216573	2221596	Like, oh, this is too far for your ikran to travel to, or blah blah blah.
2221596	2221756	And...
2225228	2228909	And it's just been... Just, I don't know.
2228909	2230370	I just have so much fun with it.
2230370	2241214	Down to the riding the Dire Horses, to, you know, the whole quest that took me for freaking ever to tame your Ikran, or not tame, but to bond with one.
2241214	2253878	And also it gives a really good message to it, because, you know, when you go to take down these sites by, you know, the RDA, the humans that are trying to be shitholes, you know,
2255422	2264787	The area around it is polluted and sapped of energy and you can't use any of the materials that you find there except for like sticks.
2264787	2267969	And then when you take it down, everything is reclaimed.
2267969	2279136	So I think that, you know, it really drives into about how people want more of things that they don't need instead of being happy with what they have.
2280701	2284722	And I think that that's, you know, that's pretty interesting too.
2284722	2293844	So, uh, you know, certainly moral lessons trying to be taught in it that may not appeal to everybody, but I don't know.
2293844	2294524	I like it.
2294524	2295605	I'm cool with it.
2295605	2298065	It's, it's, I'm having a lot of fun.
2298065	2298545	That's it.
2298545	2299206	That's it.
2299206	2300386	That's the word right there.
2300386	2302066	Video games are supposed to be fun.
2302066	2304327	And if that's fun and how you're having fun,
2305011	2305371	That's it.
2305371	2310615	You don't gotta justify that to anybody.
2310615	2314938	I was just also going over some of the high points of the game.
2314938	2318881	And the thing that I like is that you do not have to beat the game right away.
2318881	2320562	You don't have to beat any of the things.
2320562	2325046	You can just run around and go hunting if you want to.
2326301	2341572	And you can bring back like the things that you gather and give it to different camps and and home like the home tree or the base camp for another group or and It's just really really I don't know.
2341572	2342792	I just think that's fun.
2342792	2344394	You kind of get to live in in
2345134	2347975	in their, you know, bare feet for a little while.
2347975	2358540	Which is, I remember after that first movie came out, that's what some people really wanted to do, was live in that world, you know, and video games are a way to kind of do that a little bit, so.
2358540	2364522	Well, and one other thing that's important as well, that first game that came out is considered non-canon.
2364522	2367783	This is considered canon.
2367783	2373806	Like, they bring in all kinds of stuff in the movies and it's set between the first and second movie.
2376429	2378010	All right, well, let's move on.
2378010	2380591	And if that's it for your gaming week, we'll talk to Loki.
2380591	2382211	And how was your gaming week?
2382211	2385192	I just played Minecraft, as usual.
2385192	2386552	That all?
2386552	2386952	It's that.
2386952	2387532	That's it.
2387532	2396175	Yeah, I've been working on just the big build for my first Dark Ride, which is taking a lot of time.
2396175	2401616	I'm actually editing together another episode now that's kind of in between all that stuff.
2401616	2403517	And just been
2404670	2406755	Messing around in the game.
2406755	2408018	About it.
2408018	2409462	Haven't done anything exciting.
2409462	2410163	Nice.
2410163	2410705	Alright, cool.
2411892	2412572	Final Fantasy XIV
2439420	2441881	I've also been playing a bit of Diablo 4.
2441881	2447404	I've expressed on this show before I was not a fan of the current season compared to the other two, and I'm still not.
2447404	2454288	But they've really tried to make some changes to make it a bit more palatable, make it less annoying with some of the platform mechanics.
2454288	2459451	Again, I think just at its core, putting the platform mechanics in the game was really bad idea.
2459451	2460512	And I think, but I think
2461532	2464013	I think the creators are getting the message loud and clear.
2464013	2468474	It's not on our show roll tonight, but they're going to be doing a public test realm for the next season.
2468474	2472615	And I think that's huge because I think it shows that they want to get feedback before they actually launch it.
2472615	2474635	They're not trying to be so secretive.
2474635	2477476	They're also making huge changes when it comes to things like itemization.
2477476	2479876	So I think that that is all very welcome.
2479876	2487438	I still want to finish the battle pass for this particular season because, yes, I did buy the battle pass, but I love Diablo.
2488418	2495700	And even when I'm not super into the season as much as others, it's still very, like, I get in that zone.
2495700	2499941	I think very similar to, you know, what you hear my co-hosts talk about the games that they enjoy.
2499941	2508984	You get in that zone, and it's just like, just slaying the demons and, you know, clicking and seeing the numbers go up is a very just mind-numbingly wonderful thing.
2510512	2531002	So what I can talk about here instead, I want to take a little bit of a tangent train because I want to talk about the cruise because I know last week we weren't here and I was talking to Bobby Blackwolf on Discord and I told him in a couple sentences something that happened and he kind of left you with a teaser on last week's show and that was true.
2532162	2535705	And I'm going to go ahead and tell you the story now exactly what all went into that.
2535705	2538647	And I know my co host may be wondering what the hell are you talking about?
2538647	2539467	I'll cover it.
2539467	2548814	But I just want to preface this by saying, the day that it happened, I thought that this would be like a funny story, I would be able to tell a lot.
2548814	2550676	But I'm going to tell a story.
2550676	2552857	And in this story, I almost die.
2552857	2556760	This is a very, I'm, this is not, um,
2558314	2559255	hyperbole.
2559255	2561216	This is like a legit thing that happened.
2561216	2562917	I'm going to explain it here.
2562917	2570082	And for that reason, I've been having trauma the past couple nights and difficulty trying to sleep.
2570082	2573584	It's getting better since the incident happened.
2573584	2579227	But there were a few nights after that, that like I was like legit having nightmares and kind of reliving the experience and so forth.
2580348	2589510	So I'm telling this now because I'm fine with this being recorded and out there because I'm not sure how often I want to tell this story again.
2589510	2594671	And I probably will not be telling this story, even though there are some interesting celebrity twists to it.
2594671	2601452	I will not be telling this story on at work, because if I do, I'm going to have to tell it in every meeting I go to.
2601452	2609654	I'm not going to be telling this with the Rocky Horror and Love Horror crowd or even certain groups of people that know me IRL, because I just I'm going to be sick of telling it at a certain point.
2610194	2613856	But I am going to tell it now because I promised I would.
2613856	2615176	So here's what happened.
2615176	2618178	I'm going to tell you about the Curaçao incident.
2618178	2624001	So the boat for this cruise that we were on was scheduled to stop in two places.
2624001	2628163	We were going to Curaçao and we were going to go to Aruba.
2628163	2634406	And obviously, when you go on a cruise ship, you try to plan what are you going to do for those few hours while you're in these different places.
2636327	2639089	Curacao was one of the places that we were going.
2639089	2650838	And the official excursions, that's what they call it when you're going to go on a shopping adventure or you're going to go on a boat tour or something, the official excursions through the Royal Caribbean who did the cruise.
2650838	2656022	And by the way, I think everybody knows this at this point, but for any new listeners, I was on a Star Trek themed cruise.
2656022	2658084	Very important, right?
2658084	2660566	All these actors, it's like a floating convention type of thing.
2661826	2666370	All the excursions for Curacao were sold out long in advance.
2666370	2669272	So sometimes what people will do is they'll put together like a private excursion.
2669272	2674296	They go out and they find these other types of things that can happen.
2674296	2679880	And so a trusted friend was putting together this excursion to go on a powerboat trip
2680680	2683582	Out around the island of Curaçao.
2683582	2686304	And it was going to be about 18 of us.
2686304	2699913	And as part of this trip, we were going to get to have an opportunity to do some snorkeling in what they call the Blue Cave, which is a very, like one of those, and you see these things in books, like it's this underwater cave with blue tinge and a blue hue.
2699913	2706457	And, you know, just the fish you can see when you're snorkeling, like a turtle at the bottom of the ocean and all this stuff with the Blue Cave and everything.
2708018	2710500	So when I saw the pictures, I was like, Oh, hell yes, I want to do this.
2710500	2711901	And we'll be with friends.
2711901	2716465	I mean, it won't just exclusively be friends, because I think the boat held 18 people.
2716465	2717927	So the friend was really trying to fill it out.
2717927	2723592	So it was like, maybe not everybody I would know, but I would know most of the people and everybody's a Star Trek nerd anyway.
2723592	2729397	So, you know, we're all gonna, you know, kind of be in a similar kind of mindset nerds going out on an adventure.
2730117	2731618	So we get to Curacao.
2731618	2733098	We're walking to find the boat.
2733098	2737219	We have a hard time finding it because of its construction, but thanks to maps, we find it.
2737219	2738420	We get there.
2738420	2743361	And actually, before we're actually walking over there, we're getting in the waiting area.
2743361	2750283	And I see that one of the people that's waiting with us is, this is more just an interesting kind of part of the story.
2750283	2752284	One of the people waiting is Garrett Wong.
2752284	2755965	And if you don't know that name, he played a character on Star Trek Voyager, Harry Kim.
2756525	2760728	So if you ever saw Star Trek Voyager, you might remember Harry Kim.
2760728	2764972	The joke is that he was never promoted throughout the entirety of the show and so forth.
2764972	2766573	He even does a stand up bit on that.
2766573	2769275	That was an actor that played that role named Garrett Wong.
2769275	2772297	He actually still he he's very heavy in Star Trek fandom.
2772297	2774899	He goes to Dragon Con and all this stuff.
2774899	2780724	So he was waiting in the area come to find out he was a friend of a friend and was actually coming on this excursion with us.
2781465	2783406	which is just kind of like, I don't, I don't usually guess.
2783406	2783766	Yeah.
2783766	2784026	Right.
2784026	2789708	Like I don't get starstruck or any of that stuff really, you know, once in a blue moon, I did meet LeVar Burton on this cruise.
2789708	2791749	And that was like the one day I was starstruck.
2791749	2799251	I was like LeVar Burton in many ways, like, like literally after school was teaching, he was an educator.
2799251	2799892	He was a teacher.
2799892	2801452	He was one of my favorite teachers, right.
2801452	2802193	Through reading rainbow.
2802193	2805934	And I think people of a certain age, you know, associate that with LeVar Burton, but anyway, so
2806354	2808155	So I get starstruck with him.
2808155	2813077	But you know, like people like Garrett, I'm like, whatever, he goes to Dragon Con like me, and he participates with tracks.
2813077	2818519	He just has this very unique job that he did in his 20s, and continues to dabble in and so forth.
2818519	2823321	So there's a boat, friends, Garrett, going out in the ocean.
2823321	2825181	Curacao, beautiful water.
2825181	2829283	Oh my god, like just blue water that you would only see in fucking books and stuff.
2829283	2830604	It was it was amazing stuff.
2830604	2830924	We go.
2831840	2836784	We're on a boat and it's rocking up and down because it's like it's like being on a roller coaster, right?
2836784	2844531	We get to after probably a good 20 minutes, and I'm watching us on the map, we're going like halfway around the island, we get to where the blue cave is.
2844531	2850217	And this is very exciting, because this is why I wanted to see from all the picture books and all this stuff.
2850217	2852158	But there's a problem.
2852158	2857723	You see, the boat is only able to go inside the blue cave when it's low tide.
2858584	2861807	when it's high tide, the boat can't go in the cave.
2861807	2877801	However, what the excursion folks do is that they park the boat, where it is safe to do so where the water is, you know, deep enough to put the anchor down and you know, whatever it's trade, they can't do it right next to the cave, they have to do it a significant distance from the cave.
2877801	2878682	And they park there.
2878682	2882906	And what you do is that you you get out into the ocean and you snorkel
2885137	2888339	Sorry, I accidentally hit the mute button while I was talking to my hands.
2888339	2892041	You get out of the boat and you snorkel your way over to the cave.
2892041	2898825	Okay, and then you have to like hold your head as you go under the rock so you can actually get into the cave because the water is that high, right?
2898825	2907550	And they actually suggest you can go out with a life preserver on but if you do it, it's going to be almost impossible for you to actually get under the rock and get inside the blue cave.
2909028	2914171	So a few of my friends take off and they start, you know, doing their snorkel thing and they're going over there and so forth.
2914171	2924516	And, you know, I'm kind of thinking, well, my snorkeling experience isn't very vast, but I'm probably in better physical shape than I've been in my entire life ever since I lost the weight for diabetes.
2924516	2929398	I do, you know, I've been swimming enough where I trust my abilities to do so and so forth.
2929398	2930299	So my friends kind of go.
2930939	2932801	But because we were having a conversation,
2952723	2957307	Some of the other people were already pretty much on their way towards the blue cave and almost over there.
2957307	2969638	There was a contingent of people left in the boat looking for life preservers because they they wanted to go but they didn't they were like we don't care we want to get close enough but we don't need to go in like we'll wear the life jackets.
2970539	2973941	So I finally decide to get in the water and I start going.
2973941	2976323	And I go and I'm swimming and I'm a decent swimmer.
2976323	2980065	I get about halfway to where the cave is.
2980065	2987609	And my problem is, is that I'm using really cheap rental snorkel gear that I'm not super comfortable with using and doing.
2987609	2991031	And I start to have a pretty bad mishap.
2991031	2993333	Water starts getting in my tube, the snorkeling tube.
2994033	2994894	DarkSakura
3009949	3010929	continue.
3010929	3015431	And I notice I am halfway exactly between the boat and the blue cave.
3015431	3019833	And I say, you know what, I'm going to head back to the boat.
3019833	3024015	Because the boat, I know what's there, the blue cave, I don't know what's there.
3024015	3029897	I don't know if my friends are over there able to stand on things they weren't, or what they could do, I need to go back to the boat.
3029897	3031058	So I start to go back to the boat.
3031980	3040779	but my problems start to compound and I start to panic more and my legs start burning and they're hurting and I realize I'm in trouble.
3042192	3044354	And I'm starting to get overwhelmed.
3044354	3052359	And this is the moment where I noticed the excursion director, she saw what was happening.
3052359	3055541	She started immediately swimming towards me, she knew what was happening.
3055541	3069150	And I'm trying to float on my back a little bit, because that I do know how to do to try to stay but because of the rough waters, it being high tide, I was having a real problem doing that without water going where it shouldn't be and panicking almost a little bit more.
3069150	3071392	So then it happens, I start screaming, help, help, help.
3072012	3075936	And I hear from the boat, are you serious?
3075936	3077518	Yes, because there were still people in the boat.
3077518	3079601	Remember, just about four or five people in the boat.
3079601	3083184	And yes, and I'm frantically kicking around and so forth.
3083184	3086088	So one of the people still in the boat, by the way, is Garrett Wong.
3086088	3089832	He was one of the people that was looking for life preserver and another friend.
3089832	3091253	Now, in my mind,
3092279	3094180	I get tossed a life jacket.
3094180	3094800	Well, that happened.
3094800	3095461	That wasn't in my mind.
3095461	3099563	In my mind, I saw the life jacket being thrown by Garrett Wong.
3099563	3106506	But later that night at dinner, I found out it was a different friend of a friend, Greg, who actually threw the life jacket, but Garrett was standing next to him.
3106506	3111228	And throws me the life jacket, and I'm able to grab onto it, so I have something to kind of like float in the water with.
3113311	3118659	And finally, the lady kind of makes her way to me and is able to kind of push me there.
3118659	3126712	I get to the ladder, and I get pulled up by Greg and Garrett, basically pull me up over the boat thing, and I make it.
3126712	3127713	I'm back on the boat, and I'm A-OK.
3128919	3134040	But, um, as you can imagine, I'm, my heart rate is through the roof.
3134040	3138041	And as a result, I'm getting nauseous from everything that's going on.
3138041	3141922	Um, and I'm dying of embarrassment is really what it is.
3141922	3143843	I'm dying of embarrassment.
3143843	3155846	Like it's, it's not even the fact that it's like a, a certain type of celebrity, but like all my friends and I like thought I could do this thing, but the situation compounded and just got completely out of control.
3155846	3156946	And I just like,
3157466	3159087	you know, I was just all those things.
3159087	3161387	I was just like, freaking out, right.
3161387	3164648	And finally, I calmed down.
3164648	3176292	And you know, those that wanted to keep going, they did, they got back out to the cave, including Garrett and everybody, they got their life jackets on, they went to the cave, did their thing, and came back, Alan was still on the boat, able to help me, which was fine.
3176292	3185375	And once the boat starts to take off, and we go to our second and third destinations, which I didn't try to do this again, they asked me, do I want to put on a life jacket and try I said, you know what, fool me once,
3186235	3189537	But fool me twice, I'm a dumb bitch, so I'm not gonna do this again.
3189537	3193339	So I stayed in the boat and actually once the boat got moving again, my nausea kind of cleared up.
3193339	3195220	It was a really weird thing.
3195220	3197721	Interestingly enough, I wasn't the only one who got nauseous.
3197721	3205745	One of my other friends who did the swim the whole way out and back, his heart rate got so high as a result, he actually
3206837	3207977	Black Over the Boat
3231539	3233159	Everybody assured me it was fine.
3233159	3233920	These things happen.
3233920	3235980	They were just concerned about my well-being and so forth.
3235980	3237641	But I was certainly dying of experience.
3237641	3241362	And that was definitely a scary experience.
3241362	3245122	And, you know, should I have probably known better?
3245122	3246103	Probably.
3246103	3250464	But at the same time, I'm watching all of my friends in various states of athletic
3251204	3257092	Sizzum, you know, doing this and I was like, Oh, I won't have a problem doing this.
3257092	3257673	And I did.
3257673	3259175	And it was it was really the snorkel spot.
3259175	3262219	I should have been more prepared for what the snorkeling would actually entail.
3262219	3263941	And I wasn't.
3263941	3267726	And so like, if it was going to be like that, I should have just swam normally or something.
3267726	3268126	I don't know.
3268632	3277157	But anyway, like I said, I, I've been replaying that incident a couple times since then.
3277157	3283781	And even though the day it happened, it was one of those like, oh, this is funny, because it was and we were joking about like, I even talked with Garrett about it afterwards.
3283781	3287424	And we were because we were talking about Dragon Con and some other stuff that we have in common.
3287424	3290105	And I was joking about, you know, Garrett, I'm gonna have to tell this story.
3290105	3291226	And I'm going to embellish it.
3291226	3294328	And I'm going to talk about how you saved my life with mouth to mouth resuscitation.
3294688	3322551	and all this stuff right you know and so forth i'm joking he's like oh yeah that's funny you should do it you should tell this story so forth but like in the days that have followed it i'm like i i i actually don't like talking about this so but there you go i promised the story there um there it is and it is i will say this it's interesting like if i'm gonna embarrass myself do it fucking bigly
3324258	3326119	on a big scale, right?
3326119	3331443	So here it is has nothing to do with video games, but I know some of you are curious, the rest of the cruise was fine.
3331443	3335566	I don't like I don't want to make it sound like it ruined everything.
3335566	3344872	But it was just definitely one of those like humbling moments of like, oh, I'll have to take some notes and remember some things for next time.
3344872	3348755	And read the fine print on what an adventure might actually entail and all that stuff.
3348755	3350196	So anyway,
3353018	3353478	All right.
3353478	3353699	Yeah.
3353699	3355320	And Bobby says, I didn't hear the whole thing.
3355320	3356441	I wouldn't have teased it otherwise.
3356441	3357102	Not your fault.
3357102	3361546	I told you to tease it because literally when I was texting you, I was still on the boat, Bobby.
3361546	3363788	Like that had just happened.
3363788	3365429	Like 30 minutes.
3365429	3374097	Because I knew you were live or were about to be I don't remember what the time change and everything because yeah, but I knew it was like coming up and so forth.
3374097	3374197	So
3378653	3384741	E3VL in chat says, did you sue the snorkeling rental company?
3384741	3386203	No, why would I?
3386203	3388186	Nobody forced me to do that.
3388186	3393272	And you know, I can sit here and say, well, the snorkel rent stuff was cheap.
3393272	3393532	But
3394841	3398543	She did do what she needed to do to make sure I wasn't going to drown.
3398543	3399984	Don't forget that part of the story.
3399984	3402886	She instantly saw what was happening and intervened in the situation.
3402886	3407289	So I'm no, I don't like I don't blame the company.
3407289	3408530	So that's that.
3408530	3413352	And I realized having that recorded means I could never take any and that's I don't I don't want to.
3413352	3415394	It's, you know, I
3416877	3418538	made a bad decision.
3418538	3419539	It happens.
3419539	3423742	So, um, SEO 100 Matt says, glad you're safe.
3423742	3424422	Sorry that happened to you.
3424422	3425783	And sorry about the trauma it's caused after.
3425783	3426304	It's okay.
3426304	3438032	You know, I've actually, because I did tell the story to some friends the other night, I actually found out a friend of mine had a almost exact same thing experience minus the Star Trek connection on a different cruise.
3438032	3441054	Like, and he says, that's why I'll never go snorkeling again.
3441054	3442355	That was the, that was the most ridiculous.
3442355	3444697	So anybody that's interested in snorkeling,
3449759	3454461	Do a lot of practice before you do something like that, or know what the alternatives are, or what have you.
3454461	3457162	Don't just, yeah, do it.
3457162	3458683	You know what my secret is?
3458683	3460304	I'm not interested in snorkeling.
3461620	3468082	and Lesson Learned because I'm of two mindsets because there's definitely that one half of Rob.
3468082	3471263	After that happened, I was like, I'm going back home.
3471263	3472984	I'm taking swimming lessons.
3472984	3475225	I'm going to swim once a week at the gym.
3475225	3476825	I'm going to build up that strength I need.
3476825	3478366	And I'm going to do this again next year.
3478366	3480606	And I'm going to fucking kick this thing's ass.
3480606	3485488	I'm definitely there's there's a half of me that was very much like the competitive Rob's like, No, I'm doing this again.
3485488	3486668	And I'm going to do it right.
3486668	3488469	But I think I've more landed on the other half.
3488469	3488909	That's like,
3490114	3491494	You know what?
3491494	3496756	At one point in my life, I ate mayonnaise and I said, this is fucking disgusting.
3496756	3499356	I never want it again.
3499356	3504798	And here I am at one point in my life, I did a snorkeling excursion and I decided, you know what?
3504798	3511379	Next time I'm going to stick with the fucking shopping excursion because I know that that's for me and that's something that I'm going to do.
3511379	3513180	But you know what?
3513180	3513560	I tried.
3515390	3520591	I think I probably would have been more pissed off if I had gone all the way out there and then decided not to try at all.
3520591	3529693	I know that sounds really weird to say, considering what happened, but I can't help but feel like I would have, like, regretted, like, not trying.
3529693	3531654	So.
3531654	3533314	Anyway.
3533314	3533974	There you go.
3533974	3535595	There's the story.
3535595	3536995	We can talk about video games again.
3537793	3538994	Well, I'm glad you made it back.
3538994	3540454	Okay, you know, I do appreciate it.
3540454	3546197	Again, if you know me in real life, you know, because I do have several real life friends, please understand.
3546197	3548479	I'm not in a rush to tell that story again.
3548479	3550380	So don't ask.
3550380	3552481	That's my nice way of saying don't ask.
3552481	3553221	All right.
3553221	3559424	I will say this as someone who lives with permanent PTSD.
3559424	3560765	I'm not
3562179	3573185	Being able to talk about it or finding that you lose words or not being able to push it out is very, very normal.
3573185	3576167	I do hope people respect your wishes.
3576167	3578529	I am super thankful that
3579674	3579774	and
3605273	3614578	give Garrett full permission and even my friend told him that he had full permission to use it in a bit if he wanted to because he tells he tells stories about the cruise and stuff like that.
3614578	3621421	So I if for what I don't think he will I again because I'm sitting here going I don't know how that's funny.
3621421	3622682	I don't know how you make it funny.
3622682	3624403	I think there might be ways to do it.
3624403	3629666	But if for whatever reason he ever tells that story someday, he does have permission.
3629666	3632327	Okay, despite what I just said, I did give the permission.
3632327	3633348	It's fine.
3633348	3633448	Um,
3634773	3637256	But I'm not sure how a story like that's going to be funny.
3637256	3642121	I had heard something about as my friend and him were talking about it, there was a joke about mouth to mouth didn't work.
3642121	3644524	So I tried mouth to south and that got him right up.
3644524	3649810	And so at this point, it turns into things that are completely fucking fiction that are just like so whatever.
3649810	3653414	So if it says if it isn't what actually happened, then whatever.
3653414	3653514	So
3654517	3656759	All right, enough talk about that.
3656759	3661524	Let's go back to video games because video games are how we escape these things.
3661524	3664507	But it was it was overall it was good.
3664507	3665328	All right.
3665328	3666009	That's enough.
3666009	3667851	Let's talk about video games.
3667851	3675559	Loki going back to studio talks and not layoffs, but merging and unmerging, right?
3676359	3677000	Barely.
3677000	3687007	I mean, we just had layoffs from the Embracer group, but now we're hearing of different studios trying to separate themselves from Embracer.
3687007	3697615	So, for example, one of those is Gearbox Entertainment, who is looking to separate from the company.
3697615	3700097	Gearbox was acquired by Embracer for $1.3 billion back in 2021.
3703939	3713384	And according to Randy Pitchford, I'm delighted that what we might be up to is interesting enough for people to make a story about it for your readers.
3713384	3717486	I'm honored and humbled that our company is the topic of rumors, speculation, discussion.
3717486	3722869	As always, I'll be thrilled to share whenever I have projects to announce or share something else.
3722869	3725931	So in other words, he's not going to really say anything about it.
3725931	3730613	But the rumors coming from that there were
3732304	3738145	Basically, folks saying that they're looking to separate, maybe even go independent.
3738145	3741606	So I'm wondering if that's still going to happen.
3741606	3748668	But I hope so, because if not, you know, a lot of the companies under Embracer have kind of gone under.
3748668	3754249	Oh, speaking of Borderlands, the movie trailer was a movie trailer.
3754249	3754729	I'll go see it.
3754729	3755149	I missed that.
3755149	3755969	That came out.
3755969	3757489	I never did go and watch that.
3757489	3758630	I needed to do that.
3758630	3758650	I...
3763560	3766804	I don't think the casting of the characters is great.
3766804	3769887	I just don't see them as those characters.
3769887	3775612	The characters look okay, but I don't know.
3775612	3785241	I just don't see Kevin Hart as Roland, and I don't see... Oh god, I don't remember who's playing Lilith, but Kate Blanchett playing Lilith.
3785241	3785582	It's just...
3787049	3792333	Age and body types are just, it doesn't really fit to me.
3792333	3793514	And also how they portray it.
3793514	3797537	I don't mind Jack Black doing the voice of Claptrap.
3797537	3798418	I mean, that's okay.
3798418	3803342	I wish they had the original guy, but I understand that they broke those, burned that bridge.
3803342	3804382	So that makes sense too.
3806738	3807558	What else?
3807558	3811919	Saber Inactive is looking to leave Embracer Group as well.
3811919	3825243	So Saber Inactive just recently did the remake of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, and apparently that they're looking to, I guess they're worth $500 million.
3825243	3831485	Saber, they're saying this, of course, it was purchased by them back then for $525 million.
3831485	3833526	So it's going to be taking maybe a little bit of loss.
3835373	3843217	but apparently that there's an option for Saber to bring along multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well.
3843217	3850000	So they may be purchasing themselves and maybe somebody else along with that.
3850000	3860885	I will admit this whole separating from the bit that I didn't even know this was a thing that could be done and it's got to be a very complicated legal thing that I'm not going to pretend to understand.
3860885	3863767	I just find this very interesting, especially with all the
3864918	3868919	you know, problems that Embracer has been having in their botched investment.
3868919	3869999	Yeah, they need money.
3869999	3878841	So like, you know, if people are willing to buy some of their assets for, you know, I guess you break it down and make it that simple.
3878841	3880442	Yeah, I guess I guess that's what it is.
3880442	3882722	If Embracer needs to make money, they'll sell, they'll sell them.
3882722	3883463	But it's yeah.
3883463	3886803	So it's weird to hear that happening in a way.
3886803	3887183	Yeah.
3887183	3891705	So it'll be interesting to see what what they end up doing.
3893513	3896434	I just hope it's not more layoffs.
3896434	3903958	Along with that, though, we also have that Toys for Bob is going to be departing from Activision as well.
3903958	3905999	And they're going to be going independent.
3905999	3911041	So, of course, they were the studio behind some of the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro games.
3911041	3916944	And I think at one time they may have even worked on Guitar Hero or Call of Duty.
3917384	3917584	Skylanders
3941721	3943163	Well, I'm right.
3943163	3949853	This seems to be a way for studios to lean the headcount without actually losing jobs.
3949853	3955522	So as as weird as this is, this actually seems like best case scenario for some of these things.
3955522	3955862	I think
3956949	3958330	Am I wrong in that line of thinking?
3958330	3964873	Because it allows, you know, Saber, Toys for, well, Toys for Bob just had layoffs, but I guess to avoid more or whatever.
3964873	3971536	Yeah, it's like separating their own thing that can be run differently and not, you know, be subjected to the same.
3971536	3971817	Right.
3971817	3986344	Like if they're not saying, you know, if they're keeping the IP, like, for example, Activision's keeping the IP and they're looking to cut, you know, bodies, they may be just like, listen, we'll just all leave and we'll be independent.
3987952	3990913	And that'll take care of your body count that you need to cut or whatever.
3990913	3991394	I don't know.
3991394	3992274	I don't know business.
3992274	3994635	I don't know what I'm talking about.
3994635	4000197	I wouldn't, I wouldn't have spent $2 billion or two, was it $2 trillion on all these different studios?
4000197	4000978	Yeah.
4000978	4005179	I mean, and if I did, I certainly would make crappy Saints Row game like they did Jesus.
4005179	4006200	Um, but yeah.
4007233	4014916	Alright, well, let's talk about a big studio with a new game that people are very much looking forward to, I think.
4014916	4028461	But actually, first, I just want to mention this, because in light of the story I just told, and something I'm, I'm noticing, I hadn't noticed till now, because I couldn't see this until under the studio lights, the lights I have here are a different type of hue.
4028461	4035404	And I noticed it when I was holding my hand up to the camera, but this this yellow in there, it's a bruise.
4036004	4039948	That's when I slammed against the boat and was flinging over the edge.
4039948	4052781	So sorry, I know that's a little weird, but I literally just now am seeing this for the first time because I knew it was bruised because I could feel it, but I couldn't see it until it was under this specific type of light until just now.
4052781	4054963	So interesting.
4054963	4055243	Anyway.
4056320	4064184	Let's talk about Pokemon because Pokemon is a great thing that we have fun with and it takes our mind off of all the troubles in the real world.
4064184	4066926	And I love Pokemon Legends.
4066926	4070788	I think it was a great entry in the Pokemon franchise.
4070788	4073990	In fact, I'm gonna be honest, I like Pokemon Legends more than I like mainstream Pokemon at this point.
4073990	4075471	And I know I'm not the only one that thinks that.
4075931	4091364	So, very excited to hear as a part of the recent Pokemon Direct that they did, or the Pokemon Presents, that Pokemon Legends ZA, or Z to A is what it really is, Pokemon Legends Z to A is a new game announced for 2025.
4091364	4099491	They didn't say a lot, don't expect a frame of footage with it, but we just know that it's coming, it's coming in 2025.
4100872	4110799	It is taking place in the Kalos region, that is from Pokemon X and Y, which were on, I believe that is Gen 6?
4110799	4112901	Because it wasn't Sun and Moon, that came after the fact.
4112901	4115623	So it's Gen 6, the first 3DS series?
4115623	4117724	So that's a futuristic version of that.
4117724	4127912	Apparently, the city that is seen in the trailer that looks very Tron, Lumiose City, that is the only region for this game.
4128712	4135693	Now, I'm just going to assume I mean, because it would be silly to have a game with like just one region.
4135693	4138414	It's probably the futuristic element of it.
4138414	4144935	And the fact that it's so big, it's probably split up into all these different varying types, like your ice region, your water region.
4144935	4149956	I'm sure there will be at least five zones, just like there was in the first Pokemon Legends game.
4149956	4154557	But a lot of people are like, oh, Pokemon Legends Zeta is only in Lumiose City.
4154557	4155757	I think there's a lot of
4156517	4157078	Asterisks
4173223	4177389	We don't know that for sure it's just the Switch.
4177389	4180412	There's a lot of talk about the Switch successor.
4180412	4188823	And I'm going to be quite honest, I know there's been a lot of news about the Switch successor delayed to 2025, because that was in the news right before I left on the trip.
4191749	4195470	I really hope this game is coming out on the Switch successor as well.
4195470	4200331	Because from a technical perspective, Pokemon Legends barely made it.
4200331	4205253	And it even has some technical problems, you know, that prevent it from being, you know, way up here.
4205253	4215135	There's a reason why people call POW World Pokemon, when it literally has nothing to do with Pokemon except the fact that some of the art looks really similar.
4216564	4217745	Thanks for watching!
4236349	4239774	I'm done with Pokemon games.
4239774	4243479	I've barely played the last ones I bought.
4243479	4245361	I've lost all interest.
4245361	4246002	They're cute.
4249423	4256905	S2100 Matt says, coming to Switch systems is how they phrased it.
4256905	4259986	Dr. Tsuya says, weren't there also issues with Scarlet and Violet?
4259986	4260927	Oh, yes.
4260927	4261247	Oh, yes.
4261247	4266329	And I'm still convinced there was a Switch successor in planning that never happened.
4266329	4268769	But you know, go back and listen to an old episode.
4268769	4269910	You want to hear me rant about that?
4270530	4272451	Pokemon TCG Trading Card Game is digital with Pokemon TCG Pocket
4291560	4293342	Pokemon TCG Pocket will have new elements
4309637	4311679	I could give a shit about the trading card games.
4311679	4313921	I'm just going to be honest.
4313921	4314882	It's a thing.
4314882	4317785	It's a thing not for me, and that's OK.
4317785	4327275	Also, if you are playing Scarlet and Violet, there are new seven star terror raid battles, including Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise with the Mightiest Mark.
4327275	4332580	So if those are Pokemon you want to add to your team, those started over last week on the 28th.
4334021	4339085	Also, Pokemon Horizons, the series, will be collaborating with Pokemon Go.
4339085	4341666	That already, or no, it's starting on March 5th.
4341666	4344728	Sorry, I've seen so many Pikachus in so many different hats.
4344728	4350212	I thought that we already saw that one, but no, the cap hat will be coming on March 5th.
4350212	4354515	And apparently, a new attack for Pokemon Go, Volt Tackle, will be this as well.
4354515	4359178	So, and some new Pokemon making their debut in Pokemon Go with this event.
4359178	4360839	And then, Pokemon Master Sex,
4361892	4368177	Just kidding, it's Pokemon Masters EX, but you run it together, it's Pokemon Masters SEX.
4368177	4371079	We'll have some new syncing pairs with it as well.
4371079	4376042	I don't play Masters SEX, Pokemon, so not something I really pay attention to.
4376042	4385990	Pokemon Unite, I played this for a hot minute, and they have a Miradon's Unite license available and some more Cyril Edge, Phalanx also joining the roster, coming soon.
4386570	4400303	Pokemon Sleep will be getting a Legendary Pokemon, Raikou will be coming in March 2024, Entei and Sassoon will be coming after that, there's also a login bonus if you are still interested in the Pokemon Company knowing where you sleep at night.
4400303	4404687	And then lastly, Pokemon Cafe Remix, you can do Gimme Ghoul Coins and that.
4404687	4410853	Honestly, everything except the Legends announcement was very, okay, whatever, cool.
4410853	4410993	So.
4412054	4412294	DarkSakura
4427461	4448314	You know, people like to get themselves in trouble, and I don't know why they didn't think this wouldn't be trouble, or why this seems to be the only group that Nintendo is focusing on, but Nintendo has filed a civil lawsuit that happened on February 26th against a developer called Tropic Haze that has a software called Yuzu.
4450356	4454839	Yuzu is a Switch emulator.
4454839	4456340	PC and Linux right now.
4456340	4461324	They actually have on their site, they were working on a Mac one.
4461324	4475834	But they let people with that technology pirate Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom for over 1 million times in a week and a half before the game came out.
4478855	4486722	They basically said that the harm was, and I'm going to use the quote here, manifest and irreparable, end quote.
4486722	4506218	So it was filed with the District Court of Rhode Island, and it says that their Yuzu software unlawfully circumvents the measures they have by executing code necessary to bypass
4507379	4511802	technology associated with the Switch and its games.
4511802	4532314	So basically, it's using a quote, illegally obtained copy of production keys that are secured on console, and then it uses those keys to pass around so that people can basically download and play the company's games outside of the Switch.
4535891	4542816	In effect, Yuzu turns general computing devices into tools for massive intellectual property infringement of Nintendo and others' copyrighted works.
4554944	4569210	Today, Yuzu provides any internet user in the world with the means to unlawfully decrypt and play virtually any Nintendo Switch game, including Nintendo's current generation and most popular games, without ever paying a dime for a Nintendo console or that game.
4569210	4577294	And to be clear, there is no lawful way to use Yuzu to play Nintendo Switch games, including because it must decrypt the game's encryption.
4577894	4586638	Defendant must be held accountable for willfully providing users the means to violate Nintendo's intellectual property rights at such a scale.
4586638	4589499	The harm to Nintendo is manifest and irreparable.
4593689	4598212	Also, that emulator is out on Android, but whatever.
4598212	4619962	So, they are looking for $150,000 in damages and any additional damages and profits Yuzu made from its violations, including their alleged $30,000 a month that Tropic Haze makes from Patreon, and that they stand trial for it.
4619962	4621083	So, yeah.
4623208	4626189	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4645825	4651410	I, I thought that, you know, well, I mean, it's precedent already that this stuff is legal, but I don't know.
4651410	4664622	Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff that Nintendo is, you know, claiming here, but I, honestly, when they talk about a million pirated copies, when you consider the worldwide scale and the, I, I could see it.
4664622	4668185	I really could, but yeah, but, but like pirated,
4669646	4676350	But a lot of people that would work on emulators and pour a lot of their time into it, it's not about pirating software.
4676350	4677931	Do people use emulators for that?
4677931	4678672	Yes.
4678672	4691218	But what emulators are for and should be for is preserving software, of which we all know Nintendo is one of the notorious worst companies doing it in many other things.
4691218	4694800	I realize you all are going to point at the Switch Online and stuff, but no, no, no.
4694800	4697082	There's many, many games that don't exist there and so forth.
4698337	4704681	I think the key circumventing part is going to be the tricky issue that they're going to get in hot water for.
4722216	4725077	But I don't think that they're really circumventing any of the keys.
4725077	4729599	You have to have the keys, you know, it's just like a ton of different emulators out there.
4729599	4736661	What Nintendo's trying to do is trying to, what I think they're trying to do is they're not trying to win this case, they're just trying to bleed them of money.
4736661	4748946	So because getting them into, you know, a lawsuit is going to cost them a lot more money that they don't have versus what Nintendo can pony up and it'll just bleed the company completely bankrupt.
4749406	4750667	is what they're trying to do.
4750667	4751927	Because I don't think they have a case.
4751927	4755829	You can't, first off, let's assume that the 1 million number is correct.
4755829	4760591	You can't prove that all those people downloaded that game to play it on Yuzu.
4760591	4761491	You can't prove that.
4761491	4763032	Like, literally cannot.
4763032	4772736	So to prove the causation that, well, because this emulator existed, all these copies got pirated, that's not necessarily true.
4772736	4775378	Like, there's a lot of things played on actual hardware.
4776881	4780104	I mean, piracy issue is different from the emulator issue.
4780104	4786670	And I absolutely believe we need emulators because that's the only way this industry is going to have game preservation.
4786670	4790373	At the end of the day, we need it.
4790373	4796398	I understand where Nintendo is frustrated when their metrics and whatever they're looking at is showing them that they've lost, you know, a million.
4796398	4802263	But these I we have these were a million people that were never going to buy the game in the first place.
4802263	4804325	There's a lot of people that pirate things because they can.
4806653	4809255	a lot of people that pirate things because they can.
4809255	4810996	But that is a separate issue from the emulator.
4810996	4816179	But yes, the way Nintendo sees it, if they shut down the emulator, aha, then those people have nothing to play this on.
4816179	4818500	They use emulators on their console.
4818500	4819081	I know.
4819081	4820141	I know.
4820141	4822042	I found a couple of others.
4822042	4822302	Hmm.
4822302	4823623	What do you mean?
4823623	4827225	Twitch ones and one of them for the Mac specifically.
4827225	4828506	Oh, like different types of emulator.
4828506	4829007	Yeah, sure.
4830225	4839671	I mean, they literally use emulators on like, I would love them to say, well, emulate, let's come to the conclusion that emulators are only for piracy.
4839671	4845775	And then they can go, well, then why the hell are you using emulators on your software then?
4845775	4846696	Fair question.
4846696	4848537	And they're not even developed by Nintendo.
4848537	4850538	They are licensed.
4850538	4855681	To them to use, they're developed by other people like.
4855681	4857763	You can't make it, you can't have the argument both ways.
4858632	4860216	You should join the legal team, Loki.
4860216	4860958	It's a great argument.
4864314	4867597	Burn them to the ground, they're stupid.
4867597	4874403	The way they treat people over social media and all their stupid legalese with YouTube and all that stuff.
4874403	4883572	Honestly, this company is... I think they need to take an L here pretty soon to be humbled and come back to the way things are.
4883572	4887296	Because right now they're getting too high on their horse and they really need to be kicked down.
4887296	4887656	Honestly.
4888897	4902334	Highjack the conversation, but kinda, because when you talk about Nintendo taking an L, my brain is going back, I'm sorry, but to PAL world, because I'm kinda sitting here going, how has there not been a lawsuit still?
4903830	4906112	I would have fully expected it would happen.
4906112	4906873	It's a different game.
4906873	4907213	No, I know.
4907213	4910236	And I realized I am hijacking the conversation completely.
4910236	4916722	But like with everything that came out about powers, I'm kind of shocked that Nintendo hasn't pursued it legally.
4916722	4925309	And granted, maybe it's still maybe I haven't given it enough time, which I'm, I'm kind of shocked, to be honest.
4925309	4929373	I it's, I'm worried, in a way about the precedent setting.
4930626	4931707	That's all.
4931707	4940333	Because I think there is a strong argument to make about how much art Palworld is liberally borrowing, we'll say.
4941559	4946042	Yeah, but it's hard to say because I get it that things are similar to each other.
4946042	4952106	But also you could say that, you know, they're inspired by real world animals.
4952106	4954608	They're inspired by objects.
4954608	4959731	They're inspired by mythological creatures that we all have artwork that represents that stuff.
4959731	4966736	And yes, if you make two things in a similar art style based off of the same thing, they are going to look similar.
4966736	4971039	They're not identical unless they are caught like literally taking the
4971920	4978528	physical models from Nintendo's games and using them in their games and doing something with it.
4978528	4980070	There's nothing they can do about it.
4980070	4986939	They can whine and bitch about it all they want, but in the end, PAL World, I'm sorry, is going to be a better game, I guess.
4986939	4988622	Let's hope that, let's hope your new one's good.
4989253	4996596	I'm interested to see where the industry sort of takes this thing because to be fair, to be fair, Vampire Survivors had the same thing.
4996596	5001438	It's just nobody cared because Konami hasn't really done anything with Castlevania in years and years and years.
5001438	5003819	And it's it's it's yeah, it's a different thing.
5003819	5009101	I think people kind of look at it differently because like, oh, well, Vampire Survivors is such a different game.
5009101	5013462	It doesn't it's not really very little to do with Castlevania, but it literally lists like it's
5015043	5016884	You can't tell me you don't see Castlevania and Vampire Survivors.
5016884	5021946	Are you talking about Vampire Survivors or are you talking about, what's the other one?
5021946	5027508	The one by the same creator that's in the same style.
5027508	5030190	Vampire Survivors is very different.
5030190	5032210	I'm talking about Vampire Survivors.
5032210	5033471	Oh, OK.
5033471	5035712	Because when you're talking about people
5037083	5039504	literally borrowing from other IP.
5039504	5042206	I mean, Foam Stars, there's one.
5042206	5044387	I mean, that's essentially Splatoon.
5044387	5049190	No, but no, it's it's not it's not the actual assets, right?
5049190	5050410	It's not the squid kids.
5050410	5058875	There's a there's and I understand, but it's to what, like, literally, we're just saying they did something kind of similar, but to put a twist on it, that's Foam Stars.
5058875	5061416	Everybody's mad at Foam Stars over the AI album art thing.
5061416	5063037	That's a totally different issue.
5063037	5065398	It's it's it's bloodstained.
5065398	5066099	That's what I was thinking.
5067110	5070914	Oh, no, no, I don't, I don't think, no, it's nothing to do with Bloodstained and Castlevania.
5070914	5074157	I think those two are, they are legally distinct.
5074157	5077059	But like, look at the art in Vampire Survivors and play the game.
5077059	5080222	You see, you see like sprites that come out of Castlevania stuff.
5080222	5083325	But again, I'm, I'm only saying that I liked Vampire Survivors.
5083325	5085106	It was one of my favorite games that came out that year.
5085106	5086187	Like, go back and listen.
5086187	5086668	I loved it.
5087028	5093213	But it is, I'm just saying, this is an interesting question that the industry is going to have to face sooner rather than later.
5093213	5103321	And I am surprised that Nintendo is not, because they're sure leading a charge against this emulator where the case is kind of rocky here, right?
5103321	5106004	But they're not going after PAL world still?
5106004	5107725	I'm a little bit surprised.
5107725	5108766	That's all.
5108766	5110067	I'm not saying it's right or wrong.
5110067	5111168	I'm just fucking surprised.
5111400	5119523	Yeah, the SSJ-100 PAL world is fizzled in terms of player concurrency.
5119523	5121964	Honestly, though, the devs are totally cool with that.
5121964	5123485	Do they care about petty?
5123485	5124645	Well, no.
5124645	5127727	Do we think Nintendo actually cares about being petty or not?
5127727	5129247	I mean, Nintendo is good to be petty.
5129247	5132529	They're being petty right here with the whole emulator thing.
5132529	5133569	But I think
5134663	5141886	The devs are completely fine with people not, because Palworld, it's just, it's not a live service game or anything like that.
5141886	5144487	It is, has a start and an end, and then you're done.
5144487	5145847	You play through the content, cool.
5145847	5151729	They'll add more content later on as, you know, things develop on it, because it's still, I think, early access or whatever.
5151729	5153990	So I think they're totally fine.
5153990	5158432	In fact, they've made comments to the fact that they were completely fine with the numbers going down.
5158652	5163736	Yeah, and I think it's very simple why the number of concurrent players has dropped significantly.
5163736	5165757	It's a very simple answer.
5165757	5171422	Everybody bought the game because gaming media told them it was Pokemon in HD, and then they downloaded it and played it.
5171422	5172703	Oh, yeah, sorry, Pokemon with guns.
5172703	5173443	I forgot this.
5173443	5175685	Everybody bought it because they thought it was Pokemon with guns.
5175685	5178667	Well, now they all went and played it and thought, this has nothing to do with Pokemon.
5178667	5180088	This isn't fucking Pokemon.
5180088	5181829	And they stopped playing.
5181829	5182970	That's it.
5182970	5184852	Like, I think the answer is a lot more simple.
5185712	5188834	I don't think it's necessarily that they stopped playing because they didn't like it.
5188834	5190415	They stopped playing because they're done with it.
5190415	5191676	They played through the game.
5191676	5193577	There's there's enough people.
5193577	5195679	I mean, it's not like nobody's playing it.
5195679	5197440	It's just it's stabilized a bit.
5197440	5202823	But I think there was a lot of people that bought into the Pokemon with gun shit that just didn't stay for the long ride.
5202823	5203304	That's it.
5203304	5204324	That's it.
5204324	5204765	Right.
5204765	5207326	Like not everybody just plays one game all the time.
5207326	5212590	There are people that do play multiple games and sometimes you just finish the game and you go on to something else.
5212590	5212730	Yeah.
5213939	5218061	All right, um, Zen Monkey says, what's the name of that Splatoon clone?
5218061	5219682	I think you're thinking about Foam Stars.
5219682	5226466	But remember, and again, I again, I don't think you can say I don't think Nintendo has anything to say in the Foam Stars argument.
5226466	5227346	There's nothing there.
5227346	5230468	If you want to talk negative about Foam Stars, look at the AI shit.
5230828	5254888	Okay, but like Foam Stars is you're instead of putting ink on the ground the foam builds up and that becomes a very important component is that that that the foam it changes some of the physics and does different things with it because I did play the early access and know enough from that that it's it's different enough from Splatoon plus it also more takes the overwatch approach where you don't have a homogenous
5255829	5262934	DJ Ranma S in chat says I played POW World, I deleted it after 20 minutes, I realized that I don't like survival-like games.
5262934	5263954	You have succinctly made my point.
5287506	5289407	Let's move on.
5289407	5290828	Let's talk about this story.
5290828	5293110	Rockstar, Loki.
5293110	5296132	Oh, like I completely feel this.
5296132	5311142	So apparently Rockstar Games is ordering their employees back into the office after being remote for a very long time to help with finishing up, I guess, Grand Theft Auto 6.
5311142	5315585	So the company is mandating apparently that they return the office for five days a week starting in April.
5319312	5322756	Rockstar Games has found tangible benefits from bodies being in office seats.
5336323	5336923	I hate that.
5336923	5347891	I swear to God, if my company ever says, oh, we're going in the office, which we can't because we've already sold off buildings, but if I ever get a whiff that they're going to do that, I'm out.
5347891	5359899	But anyways, what sucks, though, is a lot of employees, one, they've enjoyed the work-life balance that they have with remote work, and two, some don't necessarily live near those offices.
5359899	5361000	And honestly,
5362225	5374952	Being that they're at the end of the development cycle for the game, what companies have done recently, not necessarily this company, but other companies have done, is they've
5375859	5383522	Mandated return to office things because they know people quit because they don't want to go back to the office and then that we don't have to pay severances.
5383522	5388684	So that may also be what this is considering we just had 7,000.
5388684	5395807	Really good theory, actually, because that's how Rockstar keeps their name out of the news with the whole layoff thing.
5396827	5397067	and Drew.
5407677	5411200	you know, make them crunch for this stuff as well.
5411200	5428395	So they said, you know, speaking anonymously, many of the employees have reiterated that, you know, working from home has been a lifeline to many of us, that they need to rethink their reckless decision about making and engage with their staff.
5428395	5435641	That also they fear that they'll have to work late hours in the office, which would mean they would miss out on spending time with their families.
5435641	5435801	So
5438001	5441703	The IWGB Game Workers Union at Rockstar are pushing for transparency over paying promotions at health
5460971	5466534	a healthy and inclusive workplace culture, work-life balance centered around what each worker needs.
5466534	5474278	And they said it's unacceptable for Rockstar leadership to have gone back on their word time and time and time again and have ignored workers' requests for basic working conditions.
5474278	5486785	Workers across the industry are done with letting executives make reckless and harmful decisions about Rockstar workers and are showing us the start of what can come if they're continually ignored.
5486785	5489126	There is no better time than now to join the union.
5490441	5492105	Thank you for watching!
5496550	5501311	Grand Theft Auto 6 that trailer that came out not that long ago looks really good.
5501311	5505152	And it looks like a good chunk of that was made at home.
5505152	5510614	I'm I mean, I'm sure that game has been in for years and years, including prior to COVID.
5510614	5516515	But the game looks great and doesn't seem to have been affected negatively by the work from home.
5516515	5522817	So I'm very, you know, but the whole work from home thing, I think is going to be I don't know, it's
5524417	5538345	I want to sit here and say it's going to be something where employees will choose and the, you know, employees will, that'll be a selling feature basically for a company and that, you know, people with a lot of talent will tend to gravitate towards those organizations.
5538345	5545730	But I say that yet in the face of all these layoffs happening, I'm not so sure it's that simple, unfortunately.
5545730	5553855	So maybe, and I would hate to think Rockstar is making an opportunity of that situation to do this.
5555774	5556597	Thanks for watching!
5562782	5565083	Octopath Traveler was delisted on the eshop!
5587637	5590979	And yes, that's likely why the game was delisted.
5590979	5592641	And it'll come back shortly.
5592641	5596984	But here's the the issue I was gonna say problem, but it's not really a problem.
5596984	5601987	Acquire was purchased by from software, right?
5601987	5606651	So because we were like, well, are they gonna make like a Dark Souls version of Octopath?
5606651	5607952	I don't think that's happening.
5607952	5610914	But I because of that purchase,
5611474	5617720	You have Nintendo in the credits of the screen right now being the publisher of the game.
5617720	5628250	I think they probably pulled it down to make a small little change to the loading screen of that game where FromSoftware is now going to show on future copies of the game.
5628250	5636777	It's not as simple of a patch because Nintendo published the games that you bought prior to 2024, and their logo should still be there,
5637458	5643323	But anything you buy after 2024 in this thing will have the new publisher's logo on it.
5643323	5650969	I really think this is just one of those weird, weird things that causes the sensational headline of game is delisted from store.
5650969	5655252	And that's just because they did a poor job communicating it and letting us know how long it was going to be down.
5655252	5660937	But this is obviously just a side effect of the the transaction that just happened and it'll be back.
5660937	5662058	So meanwhile,
5662967	5665009	Visible copies of the game don't change.
5665009	5665629	They still work.
5665629	5667691	Digital copies that you already bought work, to be fair.
5667691	5670193	This only affects new sales of the game.
5670193	5671494	That's all.
5671494	5676879	But how many people are still buying Octopath Traveler Part 1 when 2 is already out there?
5676879	5679721	And even 2 is a year or two old at this point.
5679721	5686928	So, but you know, for game preservation purposes, the original should be available.
5686928	5689250	I think you can also get it on
5690481	5694105	I wanna say PC, but I'm not sure if it's more accurate to say Steam.
5694105	5699310	I don't know if it's multi-platform on the PC universe or not.
5699310	5700311	So.
5700311	5705115	Alright, moving on, DarkSakura.
5705115	5707317	Sorry, I have Gudon.
5707317	5709780	Lucky.
5709780	5709960	Well.
5712415	5716062	One thing about video games that we love is the music.
5716062	5720410	And some of the games that really just have the best music ever
5721781	5726725	are the Final Fantasy games and some of those like that.
5726725	5743779	And of course, we can't have that music without the legend Uematsu Nobuo, who is just an amazing, amazing music creator, composer, very talented person.
5743779	5745861	But he's now saying that
5747542	5751966	He doesn't think he'll be able to do full video game soundtracks.
5751966	5762554	He says that he felt that if nostalgia would take over, he might do it.
5762554	5774124	But he is more... I mean, actually, he says he doesn't really see it happening, but he's more inclined to do something like a main theme or some of the overlying theme music for a game.
5777348	5786003	And he said that, you know, it's something that you have to give all of your energy to and he just doesn't have the fortitude anymore.
5789193	5805171	But he's like, and he did the last game he did a full soundtrack for was Fantasian, the game that I've been playing for a while, which is freaking great.
5805171	5808554	And it was also created by Sakaguchi.
5811256	5821142	But who had even said in 2021 that he felt like it could be Uematsu's last soundtrack, so a little bit prophetic there.
5821142	5825965	But I mean, and that soundtrack was like a 60-piece orchestra soundtrack.
5825965	5835671	For the record, by the way, as a little aside, there is a Steam database entry for Fantasian, so folks on Steam might be able to get to play it.
5835671	5837012	Just throwing that out there.
5837012	5837572	It's a great game.
5839446	5846089	But at any rate, yeah, he's going to still be doing some of his conducting gigs.
5846089	5856113	There's a new conducting gig coming up with the Marignane Heart of Ice.
5856113	5860515	But that might just be it.
5860515	5865917	He's just planning on doing the stuff that his heart is in and doing some main themes and that's it.
5866926	5867726	And you know what?
5867726	5869988	The man's turning 65 this week.
5869988	5871369	Let him retire.
5871369	5872009	He's earned it.
5872009	5874390	He's more than earned it.
5874390	5876331	Yeah, for real.
5876331	5891620	And for the record, I was going to say, going back to Fantasian real quick, it was a scene on SteamDB as listed on there, but it was done by Studio Mistwalker.
5893038	5900065	Um, and, and on the, you know, Uematsu and, you know, the, his, his legacy or what have you, you know what, Final Fantasy will be fine.
5900065	5903528	Soken is doing amazing work with XIV.
5903528	5905230	XVI was, was fine.
5905230	5907452	Um, but you know, XIV is especially is great.
5907452	5914639	I think, I don't know who did, maybe somebody could tell me in chat, uh, especially the recent VII Rebirth.
5914639	5917182	I don't know if it was the same composer that did Remake.
5917622	5917922	Square Enix
5935589	5938531	Questbuster in chat says Uematsu deserves a rest.
5938531	5943015	He's done so much and has made a huge multi-generational mark for so many.
5943015	5948880	SJ100mat says he said that it takes 2-3 years of non-stop work to make a soundtrack.
5948880	5953143	He's tired and deserves the rest and consult when he wants to.
5953143	5956606	I know he had health stuff so if anyone deserves time, it's him.
5957987	5959128	Very much that.
5959128	5967476	I always think back to the memes of the creator of Smash Brothers where it says, Never ask me for anything ever again.
5967476	5968337	I'm just tired.
5968337	5970639	I want to sleep.
5970639	5971120	Sakurai.
5971120	5971560	I get that.
5971560	5973162	Those those memes of Sakurai.
5973162	5974843	Never ask me for anything ever again.
5974843	5977146	All right.
5977146	5978587	Moving on.
5978587	5979288	Let's go to Loki.
5980526	5982547	Let's talk about more cancelled things.
5982547	6000791	So, uh, I completely forgot that Respawn was working on a Star Wars game at EA, but apparently, uh, they were until now they're not because, uh, apparently Respawn or IGN reported that Respawn's in development Star Wars FPS game has been cancelled.
6000791	6002792	Um, so that's unfortunate.
6004039	6009648	But, you know, I think a lot of this comes from the layoffs, cutting projects and whatnot.
6009648	6013995	It would have been cool to see, but we're just never going to see it.
6015605	6018608	Artwork from the game leaks out on people's resumes.
6018608	6039605	Well, and I wonder if this is one of those things where again Perhaps the game was designed to be one of these games as a service it being an EA game and a Star Wars I'm sure it was it was planning to take dollars out of your wallet Consistently and without shame and I wonder if somebody said you know what?
6040646	6044008	It's we're going to have a battlefront two on our hands type of situation.
6044008	6046369	Now, granted, they could change that before release.
6046369	6051152	So maybe, you know, there's got to be something a little more with how the game was playing or coming along or something.
6051152	6055514	Well, I don't want to lie to the layoff situation either, but it's just the thing is just interesting.
6055514	6056614	It's all interesting.
6056614	6062257	They said part of it was because EA's decision to pivot away from licensed IP.
6062257	6062878	Hmm.
6062878	6068841	Which they don't feel will be successful in the changing industry.
6068841	6068981	Um.
6071157	6076221	I don't agree with that, but I mean, sure, you can make an uninformed guess of that.
6076221	6077762	I mean, I don't know.
6077762	6079863	Spider-Man seems to be doing pretty well.
6079863	6080564	That's licensed.
6080564	6084566	I mean, yes, it's technically owned IP, but it's kind of licensed.
6084566	6088869	You know, it's I wonder if it's a little more complicated than that.
6088869	6096434	And that's a dig at how much they're paying for Star Wars and they want to renegotiate said rate.
6096434	6097815	Don't give EA anything.
6099864	6102726	don't just don't give them anything.
6102726	6104627	They're not the EA that they used to be.
6104627	6106589	They're the EA of now and they suck.
6106589	6110091	So just don't don't give them anything.
6110091	6115095	Back in my day should have back in my day it was ECA.
6115095	6116796	Moving on.
6116796	6119918	Let's talk about something else that could be the future of gaming.
6119918	6126523	It's something that Microsoft has been talking about in a partnership with Nvidia, AMD and Intel when in regards to
6127083	6130165	Upscaling Support in Upcoming PC Games
6148519	6176260	that this is where we would rather see AI sort of used is these sorts of situations, not where it's creating the art, but able to adapt and upscale the art based on being trained on said art, you know, so that AI is just, you know, essentially, you know, what it is, the automation of processes happening very quickly, very, very quickly in regards to rendering graphics and, you know, delivering through this direct SR API.
6177361	6181023	I use software that already has the ability to do that.
6181023	6182523	Pixelmator.
6182523	6193187	It has the ability, when you resize something, invoking super resolution, which is literally what it's called.
6193187	6199010	Especially in the case of... What's the word I'm thinking of?
6199010	6200450	Reducing size.
6200450	6203472	Instead of getting some of the fuzzy...
6204913	6206837	Kind of weird scaling.
6206837	6213008	It cleans it up, but it also does the same thing for enlarging, although I haven't tried a massive re-large in it.
6213008	6214089	But yeah, it's been there.
6214089	6216133	The ability's been there.
6216133	6217295	I've been using it for at least a year.
6218599	6229466	The Super Resolution feature was spotted in a test version of Windows 11, which is supposed to be using AI to make supported games play more smoothly with enhanced details.
6229466	6232688	So this API is going to play into this.
6232688	6237211	Anyway, this is going to be available soon via a preview of the Agility SDK.
6237211	6242755	And there will be a sneak peek of all of this at GDC, which remember is just around the corner.
6243115	6246577	This particular session at GDC is going to be March 21st.
6246577	6250759	Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD all participating.
6250759	6266147	This is definitely one to watch, I think, because I think this is very much how we're talking about how video games are going to get to 8K and, you know, even even more frames a second and all this stuff, you know, even more and more lifelike.
6266147	6269529	One step closer to the holodeck, if we will.
6269529	6271210	This will be an interesting one to watch for sure.
6272486	6283634	Alright, well, we're going to go to our next segment, which has a twist this year, because every month DarkSakura talks about a game that didn't see the light of day.
6283634	6285915	It's the cancelled game of the month.
6285915	6287877	But before we get there, let's play The Bump.
6298624	6306368	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6306368	6310250	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6310250	6310550	All right.
6310550	6314132	But as mentioned, it is a cancelled classic game.
6314132	6319135	So DarkSakura, what is the classic cancelled game of the month?
6319135	6321136	It is Robotech Crystal Dreams.
6321136	6321656	And hi, Nelly.
6326512	6335554	Anyway, it is a cancelled Robotech game that was in development for the Nintendo 64 by Gametech.
6335554	6341535	And I am calling it Robotech because it started its life as a Robotech game, not as a Macross game.
6341535	6342856	But we'll get into that in a second.
6343676	6356059	So basically, the overall plot of this is that you play as someone named Kyle Bartley, who was a Veritech pilot who had been disgraced.
6356059	6364001	He was former Robotech Defense Force, and he turned into a mercenary, but then he, I guess, worked to try to still
6366101	6370685	Protect the Earth and the SDF3, the Super Defense Fortress.
6370685	6371865	I think that's what they called it.
6371865	6373206	I didn't watch a lot of real Robotech.
6373206	6381733	I've mostly watched Macross from Zentradi enemies, who were giant kind of blue-purple people sometimes.
6381733	6390299	Anyway, so let's go a little bit into the gameplay of this, and then we're going to go into
6391440	6393082	the development history.
6393082	6400949	So Crystal Dreams was a space fighter simulation, had some resource management to it.
6400949	6409816	You basically, your character Kyle, works as a mercenary, like I said, and could obtain credits based on the type of missions that were completed.
6409816	6417683	And between levels you go back to your base and you can interact with different characters, buy upgrades, modify your mecha.
6419324	6426868	You also had a war timeline where you could get reports of what was happening at different places in space.
6426868	6430689	You could go help people who need it and get any more credits for it.
6430689	6438753	And then, of course, you have your three modes for your... They called them Veritex.
6438753	6443255	Or... Yeah, anyway.
6443255	6446557	You had your Fighter Mode, your Guardian Mode, and Battleloid Mode.
6448462	6450684	Yeah.
6450684	6464353	So anyway, going into a little bit of... For the record, by the way, the Veritecs were called Valkyries in Macross.
6466468	6481527	So, um, and those three different modes, uh, there was, uh, the fighter mode, and then you had Gerwalk mode, which I thought was funny for- it was so funny because we were actually, uh, looking at, uh,
6483127	6490410	I'm thinking of Jetfire toys, and the first Jetfire toy was actually a repurposed Macross Valkyrie.
6490410	6493111	So, thought that was funny.
6493111	6500915	But yeah, and then the... But there was also, like, the human-ish kind of mode.
6500915	6502355	So, there we go.
6502355	6505777	Anyway, going back to the game... Oh, sorry, I love Macross.
6506545	6516871	Going back to the game, the license was purchased from Activision by Gametech and so they pitched a game to Nintendo and Nintendo approved it.
6516871	6519472	It had a 10 person team to work on it.
6519472	6532099	It was announced in May 1995 as a launch game with the title Robotech Academy and then by 1986, middle of the year, it changed to Robotech Crystal Dreams.
6534190	6548239	Nintendo gave support to GameTek to learn the hardware and the art director Mimi Doggett, I'll read this quote, they know we're just getting used to this new hardware so they've been patiently supportive.
6548239	6552702	They're not pushing us to get the game out, they'd rather we take our time to make sure that it's good.
6554362	6565205	However, it was planned for a December 1996 release, and then rescheduled to second quarter 1997, and then further delayed to December 1997.
6565205	6573907	After that, though, GameTech filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early December 1997, after the game had been in development for two years.
6576788	6591454	They were saying that the development of the game was not going to affect the bankruptcy, but by 1997 Ocean acquired the rights to the game and they were going to finish and release it, but they cancelled after a working demo was shown at the 1998 E3.
6594536	6605285	And Arctic Press had a black and white promotional comic book that was handed out at E3, very much a collector's item now, and then Gametech was liquidated in 1998.
6605285	6614893	I was looking for the one thing I found where one of the programmers had a lot of
6615799	6616500	So yeah, it was really sad.
6616500	6618342	A lot of people were looking forward to it, including
6633095	6636157	Tomy of Japan.
6636157	6643101	We're familiar with Tomy as like a toy and development company.
6643101	6654268	They were localizing that into a game called Super Dimension Fortress Macross Another Dimension or Chōjiku Yōsai Macrossu Anaza Dimension.
6654268	6655709	Another Dimension, so mostly English.
6656890	6667701	But at any rate, the thing that they were about this is that it was a chance to have the only Macross game released on Japanese Nintendo 64.
6670546	6685295	Most of the mecha that were used in Crystal Dreams came right from original Macross, not from, like, most beta or any of the others that were used to continue Macross for the animation.
6685295	6688177	And they were pretty all about it.
6688177	6695622	However, when GameTek never completed the game and closed down, that, of course, stuck a wrench in plans.
6697843	6717940	Tommy still wanted to continue with taking it over and they had advertised it in Japanese magazines But Bandai did not release the rights to them to distribute it and so that fizzled in Japan as well and so that's That's it.
6717940	6721623	That's the story of You know Robotech
6723058	6723418	Interesting.
6741778	6742098	Alas.
6758959	6762461	This is like a PC game of the era, to be honest.
6762461	6772488	And as far as I'm aware, the music would be like, you know, of course, Nintendo style digitized versions of the original music from the Macross series.
6773757	6779278	You know, which, if I recall correctly, now keep in mind, I have not watched a lot of Robotech.
6779278	6780618	I've watched a lot of Macross.
6780618	6786260	But I think, didn't Robotech use a lot of the music that was in Macross?
6786260	6786980	Probably.
6786980	6796202	I know that some, I know that some localized anime did that a bit, like going back and watching GeForce.
6796202	6802583	It has a lot of that same repeated, terrible intro music for the US one, but during fight scenes, it totally plays the Gatchaman music.
6803854	6806156	Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs
6822125	6822786	Thank you, Ranma.
6822786	6824128	Thank you.
6824128	6834601	But we noticed that like some of the music from the Japanese version was reused in the American one in different spots.
6834601	6839828	And for the record, the theme song for that in Japanese is Total 80s and it's a vibe.
6840881	6842942	You know what, you triggered Fifth Dream's memories there.
6842942	6845323	Fifth Dream in chat saying, me, I love that show.
6845323	6848805	Saber Rider, the song is in my, I have no idea how it goes, so I can join you.
6848805	6855349	Saber Rider, and the Star Sheriff's whip crack.
6855349	6862672	It also had Peter Cullen in like one role as Ramrod and that was it.
6865034	6868558	All right, your classic canceled game of the month.
6868558	6871040	Our regular segment will resume next week.
6871040	6874324	But this is always a fun- Wait, we need a moment of silence.
6874324	6878648	Pour one out.
6878648	6879889	Okay, done.
6879889	6881010	All right.
6881010	6886076	Uh, let's get into some other news rapidly in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
6886076	6886996	Some other quick headlines.
6886996	6887217	Loki.
6887878	6901002	We have another game that's part of NVIDIA's RTX Remix Toolkit, which I think recently allowed ray tracing in Quake and Portal.
6901002	6912245	Now we have the original Unreal is getting an RTX Remix that allows you to have lots of shiny lights.
6912245	6915066	I mean, that's kind of what it looks like here is just lots of
6916598	6917799	Doom plays on a Robo Lawnmower
6937833	6939035	What?
6939035	6948910	Yes, you can play Doom on, I'm gonna try to pronounce this, it is clearly a foreign name, a Husqvarna lawnmower.
6948910	6949932	It's a $2,000 lawnmower.
6949932	6953097	That's a tech and construction brand.
6954602	6957304	It looks it looks very futuristic as it is.
6957304	6958485	I don't know how you play.
6958485	6960127	I guess it has a screen on it.
6960127	6962749	I don't know how you would do that.
6962749	6963529	It says.
6963529	6971055	But will the will the lawnmower motor play the doom thing?
6971055	6973397	Can it can it actually rev to the theme?
6973397	6974998	No.
6974998	6977641	Yeah, the blades are spinning when you use a chainsaw.
6977641	6979162	Yeah, that'd be scary.
6982168	6985970	Yeah, so I don't know.
6985970	6989112	It's neat that you can do that.
6989112	6992494	But yeah, it's coming in April.
6992494	6994776	He'll allow you to do that.
6994776	6999319	DarkSakura, what do you have?
6999319	7000459	The best news ever.
7001747	7002567	Oh boy.
7002567	7005908	And the most expensive news for me and my house.
7005908	7014611	So Multimorphic is a pinball company that does their P3 table and P3 is a modular pinball.
7014611	7017032	So you can change out one unit for another.
7017032	7018153	I have the Weird Al.
7018153	7020353	Yeah, the Weird Al machine.
7020353	7022254	I remember this from Southern Pride Game Expo.
7022254	7022434	Yeah.
7024442	7031585	Which has like a video part of the table and then, you know, an upper field and it plays all kinds of fun stuff.
7031585	7036528	So Multimorphic has announced their next game for P3.
7036528	7039649	And it's the Princess Bride, dammit!
7039649	7044031	Inconceivable!
7044031	7047413	And I am like, I'm so jazzed.
7049931	7055698	For a movie that came out in 1997, this is my favorite movie on freaking record.
7055698	7058401	My favorite movie.
7058401	7059863	I love it more than Xanadu.
7059863	7060964	I love it more than Barbarella.
7062958	7068362	But it has all kinds of stuff from the Kingdom of Florin.
7068362	7073226	It has the Cliffs of Insanity and the Ball Climbs the Cliff.
7073226	7080632	You have Miracle Max's Hut, the Fire Swamp with the Rodents of Unusual Size, and Prince Humperdinck's Castle.
7080632	7081192	Humperdinck!
7081192	7081632	Humperdinck!
7081632	7082033	Humperdinck!
7082033	7082573	Humperdinck!
7082573	7085455	Anyway.
7085455	7089638	And it's... But...
7091607	7109582	But they, basically, the head of Multimorphic, Jerry Stellenberg, was like, the pinball market's saturated, we know, they're all expensive, but we're putting out the notice now, so if you're really a diehard fan, you get a chance to save for it or whatever you need to do to help you get it.
7110282	7113825	And they wanted people to get excited about it.
7113825	7121312	And also, the creative director for this is the same person who worked on Weird Al and Heist.
7121312	7123193	It's Steven Silver.
7123193	7130639	And there's also Josh Kugler, formerly from American Pinball, who is their software team lead.
7130639	7133922	So they got a pretty good group on it.
7133922	7134803	I'm looking forward to it.
7134803	7136364	It's got the film's music.
7137324	7141809	which did you know that it was written by Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits?
7141809	7144051	Oh, no.
7144051	7144531	Yeah.
7144531	7154761	And so it had been adapted by Paul Farrer to fit the gameplay and has a few extra tracks that were created just for the game.
7154761	7158966	And yeah, it looks
7160492	7163093	Star Dust is also a good movie, I would play that as a pinball too
7180356	7181897	Bye!
7181897	7192080	So I have to tell you something from, and it's in the book As You Wish, which was by Cary Elwes, and it's his memoirs of doing the movie.
7192080	7197442	About, you know, a sword fighting with a broken toe, thanks to Andre the Giant.
7197442	7203024	But he said that the whole scene with Miracle Max was ad-libbed completely with Billy Crystal.
7204193	7212408	And that he was laughing so hard while he was supposed to be dead that they had to change him out for a model.
7212408	7212809	For a dummy.
7214730	7218672	and Mandy Patinkin broke a rib holding in his laughter.
7244201	7250067	Yeah, the two of them, like, made the entire scene just how well they played off of each other.
7250067	7250888	Yeah.
7250888	7256494	Although, I mean, my favorite thing in there is her going, Humperdinck, Humperdinck, Humperdinck!
7256494	7258236	But that movie is great.
7258863	7264506	Alright, well moving on, let's talk about the Sega reboots that have been rumored for some time.
7264506	7269569	You know, some of the rumors and things, leaks I guess if you will, are really gaining fire.
7269569	7278553	I feel like we'd heard some of this before, that we heard that Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are supposed to be coming as games as a service.
7278553	7279054	Oh boy.
7279614	7284937	So these remakes might not, or reboots I should say, might not be exactly what you think of.
7284937	7295584	But apparently a well-known atlas leaker who had announced the Persona game remakes and so forth has gone to Twitter to talk a little bit about these games.
7295584	7302168	And that there are not only the games as a service reboots, but there are also remakes
7302728	7304309	In a series of tweets, the leaker MBKKSSTBHZ5
7325943	7329367	Yes, it's modeled after AAA live service games like Fortnite.
7329367	7332710	There's plans for live events, collaborations, and customizations.
7332710	7337976	The current plan is to create a live games as a service reboot as well as a remake of Crazy Taxi.
7337976	7342661	There is a survival mode with up to 100 players racing in the reboot.
7342661	7347326	Fortnite and GTA Online are some of the main inspiration for the current Sega Super Game plan.
7347726	7353888	Sega wants to be competitive in the live service scene and use classic IPs in new ways with new technology.
7353888	7359709	Both Crazy Taxi and Jet Set are live service games that are also having remakes before the reboot's release.
7359709	7365651	Jet Set is closer in gameplay to Fortnite than Crazy Taxi, and there are shooting elements planned.
7365651	7372472	Jet Set Reboot has graffiti and shooting gameplay, an open-world concept with exploration as focus.
7372472	7374353	There are new characters and story, too.
7375951	7377532	interesting.
7377532	7379833	I'm glad they're doing the remakes as well.
7379833	7381554	I think that's very smart.
7381554	7394079	Because if the gas games servants service if the gas tank is empty, so to speak, they have the remakes to fall back on because I think a lot of people would buy the remakes of both those games.
7394079	7396741	Where's my Hydra Thunder?
7396741	7398401	They did.
7398401	7403804	I don't know if it was a full but there was that Xbox No, they call this a spiritual successor.
7403804	7404044	Yeah.
7405120	7410544	Yeah, I need I need damn the torpedoes.
7410544	7420030	All right, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in a game store online near you a little faster than the Sega remakes.
7420030	7420911	Let's start with the US.
7420911	7422112	What is coming out this week, Loki?
7423310	7438595	Expeditions, a MudRunner game on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series Mediterranean Inferno on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series
7441176	7450883	Coming out of Early Access, but the Outlast Trials on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
7450883	7455887	Berserk Boy on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7455887	7461011	As Dusk Falls on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
7461011	7467535	Top Racer Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
7468776	7481028	AncientWeaponHolly on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 UnicornOverlord on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series UnicornOverlord
7485155	7485916	Mm hmm.
7485916	7489197	I just I this that same game is on my Japanese list.
7489197	7491919	And I just have to say I think it's false advertising.
7491919	7497922	This is an AI Willy Wonka situation because I do not see any fucking unicorns in unicorn overload.
7497922	7499083	Do you see a unicorn here?
7499083	7500043	No, I see.
7500043	7503125	I see a furry, but I don't see a unicorn overlord.
7503125	7504726	But it is this a game?
7505166	7521843	it just looks like fucking about tops it's it's just it looks like it's just fucking Suikoden but with a full cooking simulator because of course of course the Japanese has to have realistic cooking mini games in it because of course uh huh
7522458	7526200	I'm doing a question, are there unicorns in Unicorn Overlord?
7526200	7536064	Well, it says, you know, that the person, one of the main characters of the game is now an adult and burying the magical ring of the unicorn.
7536064	7540285	So there is something unicorn tangentially related to it.
7540285	7541486	Needs more unicorns.
7543516	7549000	Anywho, also very tangentially... 7 out of 10, not enough unicorns.
7549000	7552363	Tangentially related to Unicorn Overlord.
7552363	7565412	If you cannot create your own Unicorn Overlord in that game, perhaps in the custom character creator for WWE 2K24, you can create your own wrestler named the Unicorn Overlord on PC.
7565412	7568574	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
7568574	7568915	That's it.
7570860	7575703	I love the ssj100 map for making a Last Unicorn, uh, reference.
7575703	7578484	Just a bunch of anime shmedrick the magicians.
7578484	7581646	Perfect.
7581646	7586108	Also appearing in Unicorn Overlord, Candy Mountain!
7586108	7586749	Alright, anyway.
7586749	7589610	Candy Mountain, Charlie!
7589610	7593652	It's a magical leopleurodon!
7593652	7596034	I just watched that the other day, by the way.
7596034	7596314	Again.
7597287	7601468	And why, did you watch, I don't know, Homestar Runner as well?
7601468	7605469	And the rejected cartoon by Don Hertzfeldt?
7605469	7608050	I did watch the rejected cartoon for the record.
7608050	7612532	I actually was introduced somebody to it.
7612532	7613792	All right.
7613792	7614252	Let's go.
7614252	7616873	My spoon is too big.
7617501	7618362	I am a banana.
7618362	7621404	I'm a banana.
7621404	7626667	But if you've never seen the rejected cartoon, do yourself a favor.
7626667	7628269	Pause the show.
7628269	7629289	Don't stop.
7629289	7630830	Dawn Hertzfeld.
7630830	7632211	Pause the show.
7632211	7634013	Don't stop, but pause it.
7634013	7636835	Go watch that cartoon and then send us an email.
7636835	7639837	Participate at OrangeLingerie.com with your thoughts.
7639837	7642739	And I want you to know, I saw that
7643786	7649007	on the big screen years ago, probably high.
7649007	7657669	And I say probably because I wasn't doing weed, but everybody around me was, and there's only so much of that around you you can take.
7657669	7659109	Spike and Mike.
7659109	7660110	Yeah, it was the Spike and Mike.
7660110	7661690	Oh God, they don't do those anymore.
7661690	7663170	Twisted Animation Festival.
7663170	7663810	Oh, that was it.
7663810	7665931	It was the Spike and Mike.
7665931	7670192	I watched it when we were at the first OLR house.
7670192	7671472	Yeah, I definitely remember that.
7672537	7674301	Thank you for watching!
7681397	7682819	It's so good.
7682819	7685301	It's just hilarious.
7685301	7686122	Rejected.
7686122	7686862	Cartoon.
7686862	7689405	Don Hertzfeldt will change your life.
7689405	7690846	All right.
7690846	7693489	That's where the line, I am a consumer whore comes from.
7693489	7694950	And how.
7694950	7695611	And how.
7695611	7697473	Can I get to the Japanese release date?
7697473	7698293	Speaking of being a consumer whore.
7698293	7699294	I guess.
7699294	7699615	All right.
7699615	7704239	Coming out on March the 7th, Irem Collection Volume 1 is coming out.
7704239	7705280	Yay!
7705280	7705861	It's our type.
7706241	7710503	Yeah, it's, well, I don't think our type is in this collection.
7710503	7712884	We have Image Fight.
7712884	7714124	Oh, Image Fight's good.
7714124	7719486	Image Fight 2, Operation Deep Striker, and X Multiply are all in this particular set.
7719486	7720467	But that's, that's still fun.
7720467	7721707	Those are some good games.
7721707	7722827	I like Image Fight.
7722827	7725248	Yeah, and these games have not been released in the West before.
7725248	7726349	So that's pretty fun.
7727436	7727956	Unicorn Overlord
7755848	7757160	Let's travel to Europe, DarkSakura!
7760984	7764487	On the 5th, that's what the next few are.
7764487	7770111	For PlayStation and Xbox, WWE, 2K24, Classified France 44.
7770111	7774054	Looks like it's a World War II era game.
7774054	7777657	For PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, Expedition's a Mudrunner game.
7777657	7783981	On the 7th, for PlayStation, we have Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1.
7783981	7788365	And for PlayStation and Xbox, Taxi Life, a driving simulator.

7799493	7808800	On Switch, we have Paw Patrol Grand Prix Complete Edition for PlayStation and Switch, Emergency Call, The Attack Squad.
7808800	7812482	On the Big 3, Unicorn Overlord.
7812482	7814244	And speaking of cancelled games,
7815535	7823302	from before, and this is a game that actually got a release after it was unreleased since 1982.
7823302	7828386	Akka R Special Edition is going to be on PlayStation.
7828386	7830548	All right.
7830548	7832570	Well, we have a few more stories for you.
7833157	7835880	And then we'll get to the listener roundtable if y'all have any questions.
7835880	7838323	I have no idea if we have emails.
7838323	7838883	No.
7838883	7839144	No.
7839144	7839404	All right.
7839404	7841246	Well, that makes that easy.
7841246	7842948	Maybe we'll get some emails about rejected.
7842948	7847913	We'll just get some emails that say, I am a banana.
7847913	7848214	Loki.
7848214	7850216	Totally hats only.
7851761	7861364	Yeah, we got the first bit of news about a new game coming out from one of the creators of Call of Duty, the founder.
7861364	7874048	It's from, I guess, we don't really know the name of the game yet, but I love the company name Bullet Farm, which is led by David Vonderhaar.
7874048	7876789	Somebody remind me to do that as the parody bump next week.
7876789	7878989	Bullet Farming Simulator.
7878989	7879729	Bullet Farm.
7879729	7881270	Yeah.
7882236	7886359	So they're working on a cooperative.
7886359	7897067	They said it was a first person shooter developed in the Unreal 5 engine that's going to emphasize intimate cooperative gameplay set in an original universe.
7897067	7898127	That is vague.
7900290	7900350	I'm
7917777	7919919	We'll add another, you know, add a caboose.
7919919	7929064	But when you were talking about Bullet Farm, it made me think of, so I don't know if Jason's listening, but so there was there was a little boo-boo behind the scenes and these things happen.
7929064	7930165	It's not a big deal.
7930165	7937830	But DarkSakura, when she was linking one of her things tonight, she actually used the link to a video on Twitter.
7937830	7939051	It has to do with the storms.
7939051	7940232	It was it was trucky.
7940232	7941312	It's nothing salacious.
7941312	7942373	It was a blizzard in Truckee.
7942373	7944935	But it's a snow plow plowing all the snow.
7945675	7951041	So Jason sends me a text and it says, is the classic game of the week snowplow simulator?
7951041	7964315	And that's when I realized that the tweet so and I started laughing and I was thinking like, actually, I'd play the fuck out of a snowplow simulator to be quite honest, because you can't see anything and you run into everything.
7964315	7967439	Farming simulator, power wash simulator.
7968139	7969641	Snowplow Simulator is a game
7994873	7998115	It's no plowing simulator, but yes, it is a game.
7998115	8000796	You can play it now.
8000796	8001396	Oh, I'm sorry.
8001396	8003357	You can play it later this year.
8003357	8004798	It is coming out this year.
8004798	8005638	It is not out yet.
8005638	8007419	Wow.
8007419	8016203	So, the Dekotora are... They take the live-in type of long-haul trucks.
8017154	8022758	And they're like, they got lights on them and fun paint and all kinds of decoration.
8022758	8026460	They get people together and like have meetings.
8026460	8032084	You did, Ranma, okay, send me the photos because I have a minor obsession with Dekotora.
8032084	8034766	But, which is short for decorated truck.
8034766	8036147	I mean, there you go.
8036147	8036387	But,
8037322	8054749	Imagine if you had to, like, do a haul, but you had to make sure that, like, your truck was, like, hyper-decorated and you get more decorations as you go until you have the fanciest truck to ever grace Yokohama or something.
8054749	8060692	Live here on Twitch television, I'm playing the preview for Snowplow Simulator.
8060692	8065854	It literally looks like someone just fucking copied PowerWash and made it Snowplows, and I am here for that.
8067796	8071638	What's great is- This is literally Power Wash Simulator with snow plows.
8071638	8084185	What's great about this is that there literally could be a scenario where someone has to go plow snow before they're allowed to simulate plowing snow on a computer game.
8084185	8089188	You can't play your snow plowing game until you go plow the real thing.
8089188	8091330	Anyway.
8091330	8091970	Just like
8094147	8094687	Oh my god.
8094687	8101611	Well, I'd like to- Oh, I found- There's a picture here of a guy who has a chandelier in his truck.
8101611	8108676	Anyway, I just want to thank DarkSakura for her mistake because now I've learned that snow plowing simulator is the thing I need in my life.
8108676	8113458	There's no such thing as mistakes, only happy little accidents.
8113458	8114399	Thank you, Bob Ross.
8116266	8119448	Alright, moving on.
8119448	8121990	Let's get to this.
8121990	8128994	I wonder if Optimus Prime turned into a Dekotora, if that would be the Transformer version of Drag.
8128994	8134077	Alright, let's do this last story, which was what Jason had referenced in the intro tonight.
8134077	8137019	It's a little... Loki, take it away.
8137019	8137680	I don't know what to say.
8138405	8147830	Yes, apparently there was a study done in Norway examining how video games influence children and their social behavior and their spending habits.
8147830	8156874	Apparently, younger players are being bullied over the lack of their cosmetic skins or are using in-game items to be more popular.
8156874	8157775	Yeah, that's interesting.
8168273	8173238	Children may experience being called poor if they haven't spent money on their character.
8173238	8182029	Children who have spent money on their in-game character can gain increased attention and other advantages, thus buying popularity.
8184230	8184930	Gamecompanies
8201849	8202730	It's that type of thing.
8202730	8205311	I think it's just because it's free to play games.
8205311	8209854	And yeah, like you said, Loki, it's this is what the companies want and so forth.
8209854	8211535	I think that's why it's making headlines.
8211535	8213977	And yeah, DarkTetsuya is really right.
8213977	8215658	They'll find any reason to pick on other kids.
8215658	8216518	Shoes with Velcro were cool.
8216518	8217599	Evil, for the record.
8217599	8217839	Yeah.
8217839	8219660	Either of y'all, why would you wear shoes with Velcro?
8219660	8221481	Because they're fucking comfortable.
8221481	8221821	Do you know why?
8221821	8222762	Why are you wearing pumps?
8222762	8225404	My favorite Aldos are the ones without laces.
8225404	8228245	And I'm not apologizing.
8228245	8230527	Oh, no, but it was cool when and like in the like
8231485	8235389	I'd say mid-ish 80s when I was in elementary school.
8235389	8238232	Or sorry, late elementary school, like going into middle school.
8239292	8251340	It was like the thing was laceless keds where you just sewed them close or you sat on the heel of your keds and turned them into mules with no laces.
8251340	8252541	Oh, no, I remember.
8252541	8259365	So right about the same time, DarkSakura, when I was in junior high school, I remember what the must have thing was with shoes, the pump shoes.
8259365	8263468	You remember the little pumping shoes that I was in high school by then?
8263468	8263768	Were you?
8264028	8264509	Thanks for watching!
8274386	8276126	Yeah, no, no.
8276126	8285089	And the thing, too, is like if your parents screwed up and bought you the wrong kind of jeans, then you had to to peg your jeans.
8285089	8285609	My gosh.
8285609	8286689	In the 80s.
8286689	8288390	So silly.
8288390	8295852	SGO100 Matt says the missus is a school teacher and she's had kids fight over being made fun of for having basic Fortnite skins.
8295852	8296912	Those kids are 10.
8296912	8298593	So, yeah, it's a thing.
8298593	8299513	Silly, silly, silly.
8301061	8308307	It happens in Dead by Daylight, though, where you make judgments on whoever's in your lobby based on if they've got default cosmetics or not.
8308307	8320277	You know, it's like we either have someone who's trying to dupe someone, an actual noob, or someone who got banned from their account and they're going to play like an asshole.
8320277	8322799	PodCulture in chat says, Early 90s?
8322799	8324880	Hell, I was out of high school.
8324880	8326542	Damn, I'm old.
8326542	8327923	Yeah, you are.
8327923	8328884	I didn't know you were older than me.
8330578	8332339	I graduated in 94.
8332339	8335880	What else am I supposed to reply to that podculture?
8335880	8345743	But if it makes you feel better, I meet people that are like, like, especially through the horror hosting and stuff that I do on the side, I meet people that are like, Yeah, I was born in 1998.
8345743	8350484	It's like after I graduated high school, and I'm always like, I'm gonna pass away.
8350484	8353225	All right.
8353225	8354926	Anyway, yes, class of 96.
8357502	8366808	I'm just like, my thing is like, especially with what I do when I'm on the phone and I get people who are my age saying, well, you could probably be my kid and blah, blah.
8366808	8368088	I'm like, I'm your age.
8368088	8369589	What?
8369589	8374372	I was like, I just have a young voice and spite keeps me young too.
8374372	8382076	Bobby Blackwell says my favorite is when kids ask, what was life like in the late 1900s?

8417260	8418400	I know it's old school.
8418400	8420280	That's what life was like in the early 1900s.
8420280	8421501	You sent emails.
8421501	8422061	All right.
8422061	8422901	Or late 1900s.
8422901	8423341	Excuse me.
8423341	8424241	I don't even know what I'm talking about.
8424241	8424921	Postcards.
8424921	8426242	Yep.
8426242	8427222	The Pony Express.
8427222	8427382	Yes.
8427882	8429503	You know what?
8429503	8430823	I'm going to say this.
8430823	8434865	People are getting back into sending actual letters and it's fucking beautiful.
8434865	8437226	I've been actually writing people letters.
8437226	8437866	Oh, yeah.
8437866	8438367	Evil's right.
8438367	8442528	You pass notes, but you had to fold them a certain way or you failed the note passing.
8442528	8446230	Aren't kids today using rotary phones, too?
8446230	8448111	Speaking of like old school, I heard that was a thing.
8448111	8449712	Like models of them.
8449712	8454434	But I mean, I kind of miss a rotary phone because you could like kill a person with one.
8456465	8463309	Like if someone broke into your house, you just grab the rotary phone and smack them.
8463309	8463989	All right.
8463989	8465110	I'm serious.
8465110	8466671	No, it's so true.
8466671	8472314	If only, you know, Drew Barrymore had had that in the opening shots of Scream, maybe that would have been a much different movie.
8472314	8477336	By the way, Snowflower Simulator has a free prologue.
8477336	8480258	So, you know, might be worth checking out.
8480258	8481539	I don't know what I'll be streaming this week.
8483113	8487758	Bobby's right, people asking for vinyl records.
8487758	8497489	I will say something, when you have a brand new vinyl record, there is something to hearing it in analog versus digital that it's completely different.
8497489	8502394	And I know that there's another boom for transistor tubes, people looking for old hi-fis.
8503072	8508938	Mishkins in chat says, I just I miss just slamming the receiver down when you get mad for me.
8508938	8511161	Yeah, you can hardly throw your phone across the room.
8511161	8517928	I remember the portable phone like the early portable phones and it was a button called flash would let you because that's how you like you switch to the call waiting.
8517928	8519770	Does anyone remember call waiting?
8519770	8521372	And flash is how you switch.
8521372	8523995	It could also accidentally hang up on your friends accidentally.
8525842	8547291	but if you didn't have call waiting if you tap that flash button to other people it sounded like the sound when someone has a call waiting like that kind of crackle because you can hear a crackle but not the beep that the receiver got and you could just be oh excuse me hit the mute button on your on your phone when you're on like and then just like listen to the other person completely lose their shit
8548728	8554870	SSG100 Matt says gotta have the long phone cord that stretches past the kitchen to the bathroom or your bedroom.
8554870	8559031	Yes, and then you shut the door with the cord hanging through.
8559031	8565213	Or I remember our first cordless phone had a gigantic fucking antenna on it.
8565213	8567794	So it was cordless.
8567794	8572916	My phone, I had a swatch phone that was like the kind of the clear one.
8574292	8584942	and I had a cable that could go from my upstairs bedroom down the stairs into the living room if I wanted to.
8584942	8588185	Those see-through phones are like the quintessential fuckin' 90s phone.
8590876	8592377	and a Welsh Watch.
8592377	8592738	All right.
8592738	8593358	Hey, guess what?
8593358	8600464	We have a caller on our Discord, which you should join, vognetwork.com.
8600464	8603466	If you want to join our Discord server and talk to us throughout the week.
8603466	8607269	There's actually quite a few stories tonight I pulled from our channel and Discord.
8607269	8610252	So thank you to all the participants who chat throughout the week.
8610252	8613154	But we do have a call and somebody wants to come on air with us tonight.
8613154	8614796	So let's say hello.
8614796	8616097	Hi, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio.
8616097	8617338	Who's this?
8617338	8618919	Oh, it's the one and only
8621375	8623837	Uh... Hi.
8623837	8625638	That was a short call.
8625638	8626719	Rob, what'd you do?
8626719	8628180	I didn't do shit!
8628180	8638168	He moved his- Hi, it's the one and only, and instead of turning on his webcam, he fucking sent himself back to the green room.
8638168	8639409	Brilliant.
8639409	8642992	Did you mean to say the one and only fucking Houdini, cause you disappear?
8645066	8645887	He did it again!
8645887	8647228	Stop it!
8647228	8648249	Ranma, stop it!
8648249	8649090	Is it working now?
8649090	8649690	Stop it!
8649690	8650351	Is it working?
8650351	8651091	We hear you!
8651091	8652232	We hear you, we just don't see you.
8652232	8652893	There we go.
8652893	8653954	There you are.
8653954	8654755	There we go.
8654755	8656156	Alright, alright.
8656156	8659759	See, I have a convention coming up, and I don't need this stress.
8659759	8665324	It looks like I'm gonna have to pull Daitenshi down and do a clean format before things kick off.
8665324	8665785	Perfect.
8665785	8667987	Podculture said Ranma hit the flash button.
8669179	8670359	Wait, quick, quick.
8670359	8680603	Ranma, Ranma, Ranma, before you get to whatever it is you really want to talk about tonight, what was the phone you had when you were in junior high?
8680603	8692867	I had an AT&T rotary phone because my great grandmother, Lord rest her soul, refused to get us push button phones because she didn't want to pay extra money for the phones.
8692867	8696829	Because at that time, you couldn't buy phones in retail stores.
8698004	8710507	You probably could, but if you were with AT&T, you had to go to the AT&T store where they would show up the latest model desk phones for you to buy or pay monthly on as part of your phone bill.
8710507	8715589	Some things never fucking change, because they sure figured out how to keep that going, didn't they?
8715589	8722931	We had BellSouth, who AT&T acquired, but you could go to RadioShack and buy a phone.
8723766	8725107	Oh, my God.
8725107	8726407	Anyway, all right.
8726407	8726928	All right.
8726928	8727828	Back on topic.
8727828	8730549	Ranma, what did you call us about tonight?
8730549	8732951	I want to Rob, I want to thank you.
8732951	8736052	You unlocked a core memory.
8736052	8737053	Oh, I love that.
8737053	8737533	What?
8737533	8739254	Tell me more.
8739254	8741935	I will say one thing, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.
8741935	8744977	This is bleeding.
8748605	8753891	I think your noise gate is preventing all that from coming through, but I believe the quote was, my anus is bleeding.
8753891	8755393	Yes, from the receptionist.
8755393	8756334	Yes.
8756334	8759017	The love of God and all that is holy.
8760538	8762919	My anus is bleeding.
8762919	8768323	Jamie, you need that sound effect on your board, the little Xbox achievement unlocked noise.
8768323	8770764	Core memory unlocked.
8770764	8773085	I'm gonna find I'm gonna find that.
8773085	8773886	Okay, Rob.
8773886	8775087	So here's the thing.
8775087	8778369	Back in I would say the late 90s, early 2000s.
8778369	8780170	Good God, I'm dating myself.
8780170	8782451	I'm going to conventions.
8782451	8784152	Some cars will have what's called
8785097	8787341	Anime Hell Night or Hell Anime or whatever.
8787341	8788804	Even I know about this.
8788804	8790247	Oh yeah.
8790247	8792250	So for those who don't know...
8793433	8797234	It starts around 10, 11 o'clock after the masquerade.
8797234	8800936	By this time, you're probably stoned, liquored up, or whatever.
8800936	8808579	You go into main events, and they would just play a bunch of really bad dubs, bad videos, and all this stuff.
8808579	8814681	And a part of this, every year, was rejected by Don Hirschfeld.
8814681	8822784	And I loved it so much, and I remember years back, somebody found the YouTube link, and I was like, save.
8824653	8826254	Yeah, he did a lot of other cartoons, too.
8826254	8828574	I don't know what he does now.
8828574	8831295	One of his one of his cartoons was nominated for an Oscar.
8831295	8833076	I think that was the last time I kind of heard from that guy.
8833076	8834797	Yeah, it was one.
8834797	8837878	It was later, but it was like something was the meaning of life.
8837878	8838598	I don't remember.
8838598	8845140	I have to go look up his wiki or something like that, which one of the listeners in chat is probably doing now.
8845140	8850622	There's always one person, but I'm glad I could unlock the core memory for you.
8853223	8857026	There was- At Anime Expo, they would do AMV Hell.
8857026	8861188	Oh, some conventions still do that, and yes, they still make AMV Hell.
8861188	8877680	One of the things I would do in my room when people would come to hang out, I'd have the alcohol and the mixers ready, my laptop hooked up to the big- to the widescreen, and I would just play AMV Hell, and we would just lose our minds over it, because of how- because how funny and how chaotic they were.
8878610	8885351	In 2016, World of Tomorrow was his film that was nominated for Best Short Film at the 88th Academy Awards, but he did not win.
8885351	8891272	He lost to another, Bear Story was the name of the film that won that year.
8906530	8912394	But that's not that long ago, 2016.
8912394	8918017	Also, they say his visual influence influenced the Pixar film Soul.
8918017	8921039	For those that watched that during the, because that came out during the pandemic.
8921039	8923521	I think that was a Disney Plus thing, so.
8923521	8924521	Interesting.
8924521	8925702	That's on my list.
8925702	8927763	And good God, my list is just big.
8927763	8932827	Now my list is delayed because I finally got my PlayStation 5 and Rebirth is just sitting there.
8933775	8940863	Look, mine's still in the shrink wrap waiting to open and play because I've been out of town.
8940863	8942184	I already cracked it open.
8942184	8949513	There's only one end of Evangelion for me, and it's Redeath.
8949513	8950374	Fair enough.
8950374	8951815	I'm excited to play Rebirth.
8951815	8953877	Hey Stingy, guess what?
8953877	8955059	This is a great make out spot.
8956673	8963317	I'm excited to play Rebirth, but I feel like it's one of those things that more people will watch if I stream it if I don't do it right now.
8963317	8968321	Like, if I wait for other people to beat it first and then stream it, people will be less nervous about spoilers.
8987054	8988519	Golden Saucer Date Night
8996767	8998068	All of them, and it made me happy.
9017423	9020484	Well, Final Fantasy VII Remake isn't a remake.
9020484	9021804	It is not a remake.
9021804	9028945	It is a it's a actually, I can't believe I can't believe I'm going to credit Bobby twice in the universe.
9028945	9039207	I can't believe I'm going to credit Bobby twice tonight on this show, but I'm going to I thought his comparison to saying it is like the newer Star Trek movies was very, very on point.
9039207	9043328	Because it's like a story, you know, but yet it's somehow very different.
9043988	9046669	And I thought that was a very good comparison what he said on his show tonight.
9046669	9047790	So I guess.
9047790	9050331	Or like the new Scott Pilgrim series on Netflix.
9050331	9051892	Yeah, that too.
9051892	9053032	Very that.
9053032	9054673	So, yes, that was so good.
9054673	9055553	Oh, my God.
9055553	9058654	But but Jamie, not that different.
9058654	9060655	Wink.
9060655	9061056	Wink.
9061056	9063277	It really isn't that different.
9063277	9071980	The new Scott Pilgrim was good, but I kind of want like a 90 minute movie to wrap up what they were planning at the end, even though they said it ain't going to happen.
9071980	9073141	It would have been nice.
9073141	9073281	Yeah.
9077010	9083573	I will say this about Remake and then I'll get up on out of here because I was discussing this with a friend of mine and she makes a valid point.
9083573	9087776	She said that the whispers that you see towards the end of the game
9088792	9090854	represents the angry fandom as a whole.
9107427	9126706	So the what they do at the end there where the whispers reset a literal somebody dies that's not supposed to when that happened I fucking screamed by the way I was like what I was I thought they would do something different I didn't think they'd fucking do that but then the whispers reset it all that whole thing and it was like
9127687	9129769	Oh, oh, it's so on point.
9129769	9131210	And I think Alan saw that scene.
9131210	9133031	He was like, oh, are the Whispers the angry fans?
9133031	9135172	Saying, no, the game has to be exact.
9135172	9138614	You can't fucking end the game at Midgar.
9138614	9143958	You have to... Disc 1 should end where Disc 1 ended in the... It's like, it's so on point.
9143958	9144959	It's so on point.
9144959	9149862	And it's a very... Then you find out another character ain't dead yet, so...
9154458	9166646	I would encourage you all to play it if you haven't, because even with what I just said, there's something to be said for it's about the journey, not the destination, that there's a lot of gaps to fill in.
9166646	9174671	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is about fate and destiny, and the characters in the game want to go against fate and destiny.
9175111	9178653	Fate and Destiny in the remake series is the 1997 story.
9178653	9180334	It is very, very that.
9180334	9186058	And that's why that's why I'm really excited to play this, because it's very clear now.
9186058	9199167	If you think you know what's happening in this game, you don't, because you didn't play the first game to to know that they they they done told you by the end of that game, we're going to do whatever the fuck we want.
9199167	9203810	I mean, I know the entire FF7 lore inside and out.
9204881	9211745	When I jumped into Remake, I was like, I cannot wait to see the changes that they made.
9211745	9214988	And I enjoyed every single bit.
9214988	9220951	I am one of those, I don't care about spoilers because I will still watch it or play it regardless.
9220951	9222953	This game is an exception to that.
9222953	9224994	I'm like, I don't want to know nothing.
9224994	9227496	I want to go in and I want to enjoy this.
9227496	9230798	And if I end up screaming like a bitch because of some great shit that happened,
9233677	9234518	JNX Lounge Radio
9263957	9266818	I will listen on the podcast feed on my way to work.
9266818	9270480	But the thing is, that was the underline from episode one.
9270480	9273142	Y'all is woke and Rob is fabulous.
9273142	9279525	And if you don't like that, go take a walk and go do something and touch grass.
9279525	9280605	That's right.
9280605	9283606	Except touch grass wasn't a saying in 2002, but that's all right.
9283606	9284127	All right.
9285007	9287269	And I don't think you came out on the show yet by that point.
9287269	9289631	No, do you remember in the early episodes?
9289631	9291353	You came out on the show.
9291353	9291813	I did.
9291813	9292294	Later.
9292294	9293075	I did.
9293075	9295297	I didn't, I just wasn't out.
9295297	9296998	There's kind of, yeah.
9296998	9299961	Then again, there were some of us who knew and were still happy regardless.
9299961	9301722	Well, I was out IRL.
9301722	9307728	I just had a choice to not be out on the radio at first, but that's because some people on the internet are assholes.
9307728	9311011	And Loki was staying in and even sang about it.
9312230	9313050	That's an all-time high.
9313050	9314210	All right, that's it.
9314210	9315411	We're wrapping up.
9315411	9316031	Too many memories.
9316031	9317471	I'm done with y'all.
9317471	9318691	I can't take y'all anymore.
9318691	9319551	Too many core memories.
9319551	9321192	All right, anime jam session.
9321192	9322192	Listen to it.
9322192	9329333	And maybe you'll hear about anime hell when Grandpa gets on his chair and tells stories.
9329333	9333814	Maybe, but there is talk about a con that may have scammed some people that happened over the weekend.
9333814	9335274	Tune in to find out more.
9335274	9336194	Again?
9336194	9336694	Well, don't worry.
9336694	9339735	They'll give everybody 30 minutes in the ball pit.
9339735	9340135	You got it.
9340819	9341579	All right.
9341579	9342819	Bye Rama.
9342819	9344960	Bye.
9344960	9346240	All right.
9346240	9348441	Uh, with that, I think we're gonna wrap it up.
9348441	9349781	Actually, let me check in with Loki real quick.
9349781	9351361	If there's any last minute stories.
9351361	9353021	I might have missed a headline, but I don't think I did.
9353021	9354122	There is not.
9354122	9354862	I figured.
9354862	9355102	All right.
9355102	9355582	Well, that's fine.
9355582	9357542	Because we're, we're coming up on two and a half hours.
9357542	9359183	I think we're good to wrap up.
9359183	9361763	I do want to of course, thank everybody for listening tonight.
9361763	9365304	Thank you for being back this week, even though we were gone last week very randomly.
9366044	9369826	Let me tell you, I appreciate a vacation in spite of everything we talked about tonight.
9369826	9371006	I had a great time.
9371006	9372507	And I'm going again next year.
9372507	9375128	So I hope y'all are ready for it.
9375128	9376889	And that's, that's it.
9376889	9378490	Thank you so much for listening to the show.
9378490	9381691	We'll be back in seven days to talk about whatever happens this week.
9381691	9382712	Enjoy your gaming this week.
9382712	9390375	If you'd like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
9390375	9392036	So yeah, tell a friend.
9392396	9393197	DarkSakura streaming tonight!
9408920	9411901	It's going to be a little bit short because I have work tomorrow.
9411901	9414563	I'm actually starting training that I don't need.
9414563	9417364	But yeah, it's killer night on Debbie Delight.
9417364	9419265	So it's going to happen.
9419265	9420245	Please be there.
9420245	9421286	Please stay.
9421286	9422346	I could use some company.
9422346	9424087	I've been a little down.
9424087	9425548	So I'd appreciate it.
9425548	9427668	But anyway, you don't have to.
9427668	9429129	Just it would be appreciated.
9429129	9429509	All right.
9429509	9431830	Anyway, well, and what I would like to end with.
9431830	9433811	Yes.
9433811	9435332	Everybody a little bit gay.
9438362	9441023	All right, have a good one, DarkSakura.
9441023	9442964	Bye.
9442964	9444204	All right, we'll go over to you, Loki.
9444204	9446205	What's your final thought tonight?
9446205	9452328	My final thought is that I will be well I I was getting it ready.
9452328	9459691	It's kind of already ready to go but I still want to add a few more things to it but I'll be dropping merch drop merch this week.
9461144	9464329	I'm so excited to see what quotable things you have.
9464329	9466131	Uh, it's right now.
9466131	9469956	It's all the robot master stuff from season two of channel 64.
9469956	9475684	But yeah, we'll see about adding some other non things in there.
9475684	9477727	I do need to do a pixel poop shirt.
9477727	9478148	That'd be fun.
9478984	9480645	you should do a pixel blue shirt.
9480645	9482705	All right, you have all the sprites.
9482705	9487487	I just get permission from Aaron and be the nice thing to do but I think he could be okay with it.
9487487	9487767	All right.
9487767	9490308	Um, that's gonna do it.
9490308	9504873	My final thought I don't know I have a lot of video games to catch up on and most of it is just playing things that have fucking seasonal content and stuff I need to catch up on like Diablo four and no man's sky I needed to get that expedition done that's on my list as well and then I'll get to fall fancy seven rebirth.
9505393	9507755	But that is going to do it for Orange Lingerie tonight.
9507755	9512239	Thank you all so much for being here and staying up with us tonight and listening to us in the podcast feed.
9512239	9513460	And again, joining us after a break.
9513460	9514881	We really appreciate it.
9514881	9517544	The road to 1000 episodes continues, if you can believe it.
9517544	9520506	We're six weeks away at this point from 1000 episodes.
9520506	9522128	And that is that is something no
9522848	9525610	Weekly Gaming Podcast has ever done.
9525610	9526370	Emphasis on weekly.
9526370	9530433	I know there's at least at least one other show that is more than just weekly that has done it.
9530433	9532895	But as far as a weekly show goes, we'll be the first.
9532895	9534456	So that's really exciting.
9534456	9536697	So thank you all for being here and being a part of it.
9536697	9543602	Whether you go all the way back to episode one that DJ Ranma S was quoting earlier, or others, really appreciate all of your support.
9543602	9549906	If you just joined us at episode 993 last week, or even tonight, it means just as much to us as all the rest of it.

9551547	9552348	Have a great week, everybody.
