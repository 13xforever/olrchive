9648	14032	In case you thought otherwise, it's not just deliveries to home addresses that have strange courier mistakes.
14032	17895	Even Panic, makers of the bright yellow Playdate, have been subject to shipping shenanigans.
17895	25421	As revealed in his GDC talk, a pallet of Playdates was delivered to a Circle K construction site instead of to their intended destination, the shipping warehouse next door.
25421	27402	Data is hard, and handling is harder.
27402	28403	Don't get cranky!
28403	33527	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
33527	35769	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,
39127	41529	Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.
41529	46152	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46152	48774	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48774	59303	We are live again tonight on what is totally the first take for the 998th episode of our show tonight, March the 31st of 2024.

69410	72531	DarkSakura, Jamie, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
90481	91321	Yay cake!
91321	94022	And I've decided to go for the cake pie.
94022	95223	The Boston cream pie.
95223	97144	What kind of cake are you getting?
97144	100325	Boston cream pie, which is indeed a cake pie.
100325	102026	I see, I see.
102026	102926	I'm going there, Rob.
102926	103907	I'm going there.
103907	105007	Yum.
105007	106808	And everyone can celebrate with me.
108341	121577	For those of us that are watching us live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except sometimes Bobby takes the night off, as he did tonight.
121577	124741	He'll be back next week, but we are live still at 9 o'clock Eastern.
124741	127965	And something else that is happening tonight that has never
128445	142070	Happened before besides three misfires on the audio board would be look at this if you can see that again Sorry, this is only for the live folks that are watching live tonight Notice there is a cat behind me on the couch.
142070	143531	This never happens.
143531	151254	He's never in here actually during the show and this is why if you're gonna say why is the blanket on the couch unmade and
151934	153074	I can't make it.
153074	155755	He's taken up the couch.
155755	157235	Cat has totally taken over.
157235	160936	Yeah, but that's I mean, that's what messy blankets are for is for cats to take over.
160936	164937	So there it is an actual rare cheddar sighting.
164937	166518	And that's that's the joy of being here live.
166518	168258	I'm sorry to the podcast listeners.
168258	170278	I do have good news for the podcast folks as well.
170278	172759	But first, let me introduce Techmaster Loki.
172759	173179	Hey, Loki.
173179	174599	Hello.
174599	176020	How are you doing?
176020	176640	I'm doing okay.
177051	179873	Okay, what is this game I see behind you live tonight?
179873	183535	It is obviously some sort of Easter game, but not a very good one.
183535	186077	No, I mean, there's not many Easter games to pick from.
186077	192341	It is, for the PlayStation 1, it is called Easter Bunny's Big Day.
192341	193482	Wow, okay.
193482	200306	I didn't even, this strikes me as like, when they remade Wolfenstein 3D as a Noah's Ark game or something like that.
200306	202828	It just, it just doesn't hit the same as the original.
204588	213232	Yeah, I don't know what this would have originally been, but, um, yeah, I just did a real quick Easter long play and this is the first thing that came up.
213232	213812	There you go.
213812	216453	Hey, whatever, whatever works, whatever works.
216453	219294	Uh, we're going to get into the news as we always do here on the show.
219294	221435	I said some good news for the podcast listeners.
221435	222396	So let me tell you what it is.
222396	224377	Well, first, apparently bad news.
224377	227378	So in the, cause you know, what's good news, that little bad news.
227378	228138	Well, here's the thing.
228138	233581	Apparently, uh, Google has decided to kill yet another one of its products.
234281	238384	After all this, you know, Google is infamous for not keeping its price.
238384	239124	It's a miracle.
239124	243667	My Gmail account still functions and that our Google calendar still work.
243667	248190	But Google has decided they will be killing off Google podcasts.
248190	253073	So I used to say at the end of the show, I don't think I've said it in a while, but you could find this show on Google podcasts.
253073	256655	And I think you still can, at least for a few more months.
256655	261699	But Google is going to be sunsetting podcasts in favor of YouTube podcasts.
262339	265222	is the the platform they're going to be folding that into.
265222	272630	And it was brought to my, it was brought to my attention through our discord server, which of course, shout out for VOGnetwork.com slash discord.
272630	276033	It was brought to my attention that we aren't on YouTube podcasts.
276033	277595	And I was like, what?
277595	282720	I kind of assumed that if we were on Google's ecosystem, we were on YouTube's podcast.
282720	283741	So long story long,
284602	286765	We're now on YouTube podcasts.
286765	294833	So or as Tigerclaw reframes it, it's YouTube music, which happens to have a podcast section.
294833	295894	Fine.
295894	296315	Fine.
296315	298337	But my point is- That makes sense.
298337	298597	Yes.
299656	301757	Yes, so we're now there.
301757	306300	So if you weren't aware, and YouTube is actually your preferred platform, there you go.
306300	313705	I do want to point out this is not the video recording of our show that we do on Twitch on YouTube.
313705	315366	So you will not actually see
315866	316467	Check it out!
341940	343382	All right.
343382	348208	Anyway, we're going to get in now to some news and talk about what is going on this week.
348208	348568	Oh, what's that?
348568	351391	There's one more new thing for those who are watching live.
351391	352413	Do you notice anything?
353909	355090	Um, well, okay.
355090	356611	I know this is new.
356611	361794	Oh, your VTube is not, uh, recording.
361794	364496	This is live again, because guess what?
364496	366177	New Mac studio.
366177	366517	That's right.
366517	373902	I knew you got a new, um, not a new PC, a new Mac, because you were, um, talking about that on your own stream, but that's right.
373902	375383	64 gig of RAM.
375383	376303	Oh, how nice.
376303	378184	It's beautiful.
378184	380486	Many, many cores of graphics.
380626	385348	Yeah, I meant to hop in the stream last night, but I was out and about, so I didn't get to watch.
385348	386689	I didn't play last night.
386689	387769	Oh, I mean, two nights ago.
387769	390670	I went to Alicia's birthday party.
390670	392251	But you've done a stream on this new computer.
392251	392631	How did it go?
392631	397093	Yeah, I did, because my computer actually arrived a day early.
397093	399114	It arrived on Thursday.
399114	402075	Oh yeah, this is just for Bradley, since he brought it up.
404525	408046	Oh my god, it actually sees you down to your middle finger.
408046	409646	I didn't think it did that before.
409646	410226	It's very nice.
410226	416088	Two, three, four, five, back to one.
416088	416928	That's nice.
416928	417308	All right.
417308	421909	Anyway, but yeah, I got everything ready.
421909	427551	So I just decided to do my Friday Avatar stream and well, I accidentally beat the game.
427551	428431	Oops.
428431	431952	It has the longest credits ever.
432392	441043	Well, like I made a comment at one point that I was now in a committed relationship with those credits because I was going to see them to the end and see if I got anything.
441043	443886	You can still there's actually like an after game.
443886	446009	You can still keep doing like your quests and stuff.
446009	448192	So I'm going to keep enjoying it.
448192	450935	But it needs a game over the credits like Smash Brothers.
451576	455939	That's I was screaming during that whole last fight, though, because I was like, stupid game.
455939	460783	Because I've tried to the only thing I've used like any kind of FAQ for was like finding stuff.
460783	464526	But anyway, I'll talk about that in my my gaming week.
464526	467548	But I just wanted to bring up that my VTuber's back.
467548	468629	No, thanks for reminding.
468629	471431	It's nice to nice to see you in motion.
471431	471751	It's great.
472532	480338	All right, well, getting into our lead story tonight, let's talk about the Final Fantasy 14 release on the Xbox platform.
480338	482540	But it's not quite the news story you think.
482540	485242	I mean, yes, the game did release on the Xbox platform.
485242	487183	You know, all you know, all out there.
487183	488985	I love Final Fantasy 14.
488985	490626	This isn't why I'm bringing it up, though.
490626	496470	It's actually a report that Final Fantasy 14 players that are playing on Xbox are getting banned.
500012	504492	Not just for playing the game, but apparently for some of the words that they're using.
504492	521716	For example, using the in-game chat to look for a free company with somebody going to Reddit to post that they got banned by Microsoft for advertising a free company under some type of self-promotion or even potentially like NSFW type of chat that's happening there.
522496	527577	Apparently, Microsoft is also overreaching in some of the beds.
527577	529738	So, for example, you can't say Glass.
529738	533919	You can just say GL, because that's censored.
533919	540900	One of the cities in Final Fantasy XIV, or one of the regions, is Thanalan.
540900	546301	And you can't even type Thanalan, because it's T-H-A-N-A-L-A-N.
549642	553763	And unfortunately, there's a nasty little word there in the middle.
553763	558424	And so you talk about like having anal fissures and going to the doctor.
558424	565966	So this is the point is that Microsoft is allegedly anyway, overreaching with a lot of these bands.
565966	567327	Their bot is too sensitive.
568227	574171	Yeah, this bot, she said, well, it's it's funny you call it a bot, because there are some reports out there.
574171	578054	And I don't, you know, again, we're only hearing from the user perspective.
578054	581716	And that's why I have to say allegedly, and so forth, because we don't know.
581716	588741	Allegedly, this person could have advertised a free company and then advertise something bad and said, Oh, I got a ban for this.
588741	590082	You know how some people on the internet are.
590842	597803	But it does seem very likely that the Microsoft ban protocol is really overreaching on this whole thing.
597803	605224	And some people are bringing up the fact that Microsoft actually laid off a chunk of their moderation group.
605224	607505	Remember those big layoffs that happened a few weeks ago?
607505	612006	They've actually laid off a portion of that group in favor of, you ready?
612006	613166	You ready?
613166	617166	AI to be doing a lot of this.
617166	618547	And so it's really Owl.
618547	620087	They're just having Owl do everything.
620737	623338	And now it's a Japanese girl named Ai.
623338	625159	It means love.
625159	632301	Here's, so here is the whole, now again, this is all allegedly we're making it up because of course Microsoft isn't commenting on this.
632301	635942	Until Microsoft comments on this, we have no choice but to make it up.
635942	643185	And that is what the, and Microsoft, if you're out there, this is what the internet is going to continue to do until you make this very clear for folks.
643185	644446	They're going to make it up.
644446	645726	This is human nature.
645726	647967	Your brain fills in the gaps with assumptions.
648607	651930	if you don't, you know, tell people what's going on.
651930	657956	And so people are saying that, you know, this is AI's fault and AI is overreaching.
657956	674591	And this is a case of you reap what you sow for Microsoft's case is that this, this is what you get for thinking that AI could do the job of humans, because it's going to take a very, very, very long time for machine learning to learn a lot of the nuances about
675111	680655	The English language, let alone the hundreds of other languages that are spoken on Xbox Live.
680655	685119	And the fact that a dirty word is not as simple as anal.
685119	696388	Anal can be part of a larger word like thanalan, or like DarkSakura pointed out, there is completely non-abusive, derogatory, scientific reasons why you might say that.
696388	697188	I don't know.
697188	701412	Maybe you're playing Trauma Center and you're having- I don't even think it's on Xbox.
701992	708518	Like, oh, my my cousin is in the hospital for some sort of weird anal cancer.
708518	709899	You know, that's one thing.
709899	714863	And, you know, quite different than saying, you know, let's go do your anal cavity or something.
714863	715464	I don't know.
715464	716244	Yeah.
716244	716925	Legit.
716925	720128	You reminded me of the use of the term.
720128	721749	Actual thing that happens.
721749	723811	And you legit reminded me.
723811	728455	Farrah Fawcett icon legend passed away from a cancer.
728455	728595	Yeah.
729662	730682	You know, I need that.
730682	732003	Yeah, you did a lot of people.
732003	733723	It was the same day as Michael Jackson.
733723	737484	That's why a lot of people like Sarah Fawcett was more important.
737484	738384	What an icon.
738384	739624	She was an icon.
739624	741305	And, you know, I'm saying that hair icon.
741305	747306	I'm saying that complete seriousness is that if you want to be able to raise awareness, it's not a teehee giggly thing.
747306	751367	It's a serious thing that has taken the lives of iconic people.
751367	755828	This stream was talking about the Panama Canal or what about an analysis?
755828	756348	Yeah.
756348	756488	So.
757626	760809	I mean, there is a difference between an analysis and an analysis.
760809	766633	All this talk is like, you know, and obviously, obviously, we are hyper fixated on one thing.
766633	767133	Go figure.
767133	769375	We're hyper fixated on the on the anus.
769375	769996	No, I'm kidding.
769996	781505	But joking aside, like, obviously, it goes to show there is so much nuance with language that you can't expect an automated system to be able to catch.
782185	785146	And obviously- And you're being so anal about it.
785146	790027	And MMOs require people to be able to communicate.
790027	798128	Being able to talk about, hey, you complete that quest in central Thanalan is important to the game.
798128	803369	You collect those gears with mining in East Thanalan.
803369	805350	You need to be able to say those types of things.
806232	815356	So this whole moderation thing, and to be fair, the Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is already fucking weird.
815356	819457	And the reason why is because you have to pay with the Xbox coins.
819457	825119	You don't have your sub directly through the Mog Station like you do on other platforms.
825119	831862	You have to have Xbox Gold or whatever it's called now, Game Pass Essentials, whatever they call what used to be gold.
832122	834704	The stream says the butthole Ian.
834704	845374	You have to be able to have Game Pass and the subscription, which a lot of people are saying you have to double dip because on PlayStation, you don't have to have PlayStation Plus in order to play Final Fantasy XIV online.
845374	849757	So Microsoft, for whatever reason, is putting all of these other barriers in it.
849757	856183	And now you can't even say Free Company or Thanalan or whatever, because there might be a dirty word in it.
856687	859850	And so let's let's set about free company though.
859850	863074	I Oh, well, no, I don't think it's actually the word free company.
863074	875587	But I think because somebody was shouting, Hey, are you interested in joining a group of like minded people that it was advertising for their free company, but the game picked it up as spam, basically is what sounds like.
875587	878230	So and there should you know, sure.
878590	881793	Free company for only $5 a minute.
881793	885315	Call 1-800 or 1-900 free company.
885315	896043	Okay, DarkSakura, you joke, but do you know what they also advertise a lot of times in chat is the after dark dance parties that happen in the housing districts in Final Fantasy 14.
896043	898105	This is a real, real fucking thing.
898105	900587	I'm not making this up.
900587	903569	Discord parties, DJ, it's all.
903569	904310	Yeah, exactly.
904730	906872	The Eorzea Circuit Party.
906872	907552	Yeah, exactly.
907552	909514	The Eorzea Circuit Party.
909514	912656	And remember, they advertised on a billboard one time that was in the news.
912656	914818	But anyway, you should be allowed.
914818	920723	I mean, even though I understand those things can be inconvenient, they do have a right to shout in those channels.
920723	923645	And if you, you know, you can always turn those channels off and so forth.
923645	927728	So at least, you know, they're, they're doing it the way they should.
927728	929930	And it just sucks to see them penalized for it.
929930	931151	Can I even say penalized?
931151	933133	Or is the system going to pick that up as a dirty word too?
934640	939866	Oh, I mean, I guess you could get a penal cyst.
939866	942488	Fifth Dream in chat says, what about free anal?
942488	943029	Join us.
943029	944691	No, I don't think you could be.
944691	949275	The system probably wouldn't like that, like extra, extra a lot.
949275	950897	This is just the thing.
950897	952679	What about annual?
952679	955181	People typo that all the time as anal, right?
955181	955402	Right.
956653	960779	Can't expect AI to do a person's job.
960779	966868	And I can't believe Microsoft, one of the leading tech companies out there, is going to learn this fucking lesson the hard way.
966868	968430	Well, I can actually believe it.
968430	970433	But I also can't believe it.
970433	971675	This is just... I...
972516	991698	It's yet again, another one of those boardroom executive stuffy folk mistakes that make way too much money mistakes that just don't fucking understand how gaming fucking works making these decisions that then just make them look ridiculous, which is what this whole thing is doing.
993777	999162	I just think we just need robots to not do moderation.
999162	1008971	Robots can maybe select things that could be looked at by a human or maybe highlight things that should be looked at later.
1010046	1012587	But the system shouldn't be doing the bands automatically.
1012587	1028855	Essentially, they should understand this is the whole mantra of robotic process automation, which is you have to have it be repeatable and rule-based in order to be able to do any sort of thing with AI or machine learning or that type of thing.
1028855	1031876	It has to be predictable enough to follow certain guidelines.
1034068	1037050	Yeah, they're not also understanding context, obviously.
1037050	1040452	Well, that's one thing that robots don't understand a lot of times is context.
1040452	1045075	And so that's why we run into this type of stuff.
1045075	1051658	Well, this honestly, and I don't I don't mean to, you know, be exaggeratory or whatever, but also I kind of mean it.
1051658	1060824	This this this type of thing ought to be something that Microsoft ought to be held accountable for because their their whole ban appealing system is not great.
1061224	1066187	It takes people forever to have things looked at, if they even get it looked at at all, again, by a real person.
1066187	1078593	But as I pointed out, for this person advertising their free company to be able to play Final Fantasy XIV online, they're paying a Game Pass sub, they're paying for Xbox coins, and now they've been booted off the system for no reason.
1078593	1084536	And I understand that's all in the fine print that you're supposed to scroll through that nobody actually reads, that they are able to do that.
1084536	1087778	I do realize that, but at the same time, there comes a point where it's like,
1088679	1093524	The breach of contract is so egregious as it's happening here that that should not apply.
1093524	1102254	The fact that there is no realistic system to have things appealed in a timely manner, this person should get their money back.
1102254	1103716	100%.
1103716	1107560	And they ought to be entitled to get their money back.
1107560	1109081	At least to do a proper appeal.
1109081	1109322	Yeah.
1110717	1117459	So I look, I don't I don't want to call out the lawyer vultures to come to action.
1117459	1119840	But I think I'm going to have to in this case.
1119840	1123301	I don't mean to call out those Facebook ads that always pop up on my thing.
1123301	1124962	Have you bought something from Steam?
1124962	1126702	Have you subscribed to World of Warcraft?
1126702	1130844	You could be entitled that which is that all that stuff is a scam.
1130844	1135165	But but we need the actual lawyer vultures to come out and do a class action on this.
1135165	1137366	This is the only way this shit's gonna change.
1138166	1141867	That's the it's going to take a fucking class action lawsuit for this to change.
1141867	1146569	And so free company person, I hope you get in on that.
1146569	1152871	And, you know, I'm sure of course, a class action lawsuit is literally not going to cause anybody to actually get their money back.
1152871	1156433	But it will cause Microsoft to change the system.
1156433	1162815	And that's, that's like the one time I actually feel like it might be a good thing until I'm convinced otherwise.
1164912	1170986	Alright, well, we'll get into our gaming weeks and hopefully we weren't banned from any platforms this week, but stay tuned.
1170986	1172048	Maybe we were.
1172048	1173171	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1173171	1173832	How was your gaming week?
1175029	1177491	It was pretty good.
1177491	1187197	Like I said, I got my... I played Dead by Daylight with Fixie and Shayla on Tuesday, which was great because I miss playing with the both of them together.
1187197	1192420	And we made another new friend who played with us.
1192420	1197583	I did get my computer on Thursday, a Mac Studio.
1197583	1201966	I didn't, of course, get the biggest one because I just didn't have the three grand for it, you know?
1202666	1206328	But the one I got is is pretty great.
1206328	1213753	I got like the second level processor and yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty happy with it.
1213753	1218416	If I could find the specs, I would go over a bit more.
1218416	1218957	OK, yeah.
1218957	1230844	So what I got is I have an M2 Max with a 12 core CPU, 38 core GPU, 16 core neural engine, 64 gigabyte of RAM, one terabyte SSD and
1232567	1237606	It's certainly made it where I can use my VTuber and even right now.
1238699	1249048	I have everything that I normally have running during this show, and my full VTuber running, and Daz Studio, which is a 3D software application running in the background as well.
1249048	1251010	So, I'm feeling no pain.
1251010	1265763	I mean, I'm sure my animation is smooth, and everything is fine, so... Of course, that made playing Avatar really nice, but then I learned something is that the problems I'm having with OBS are independent of my computer's capabilities.
1266920	1273004	and that GeForce likes to apply its own idea of a web connection.
1273004	1275966	That has nothing to do with my Gigabit Ethernet either.
1275966	1278648	So, running into some issues there.
1278648	1284471	But I did up my bitrate for Twitch and it still kept up pretty well.
1284471	1285072	It looked alright.
1286353	1290157	But yeah, I beat Avatar Frontiers of Pandora and I'm going to keep playing.
1290157	1297305	I did not play Castlevania or Dracula XX or whatever because I was at my friend's party.
1301029	1308755	I am going to be playing more Dead by Daylight tonight and I'm prepping up for a marathon on my birthday.
1308755	1313278	And I've started like another really stupid game today.
1313278	1315360	It's like, what's it called?
1315360	1317921	It's a Tamagotchi game.
1317921	1319523	Like Tamagotchi World Adventure.
1319523	1320683	Oh, okay.
1322286	1331429	There's like some Animal Crossing ripoff stuff in there, so I'm not gonna go too far into that.
1331429	1336611	But I mean, it was a fun little waste of time, you know.
1336611	1338151	But yeah, that's been it.
1338151	1343813	It's mostly been me trying to... I haven't tried Baldur's Gate on this computer.
1343813	1345894	I still don't know if I'll be able to stream it at all.
1346574	1358318	But I'm gonna go see what happens if I can run Baldur's Gate 3 at max level, because I have the native Mac version.
1358318	1358938	Nice.
1358938	1359898	We'll see.
1359898	1360238	All right.
1360238	1361999	But yeah, I'm having fun.
1361999	1363139	I like it.
1363139	1363799	It's beefy.
1363799	1366780	It's always fun to have a shiny new computer.
1366780	1367621	It's tall.
1367621	1369821	OK, so you know about how tall the Mac mini is?
1369821	1370902	Mm-hmm.
1370902	1373523	This is about three Mac minis and a trench coat tall.
1375583	1376283	Nice.
1376283	1378245	So it's I like it.
1378245	1378805	All right.
1378805	1379385	My baby.
1379385	1382067	I need a new name for her, though.
1382067	1385228	You should have a contest to name.
1385228	1385809	We'll see.
1385809	1386549	Spawn.
1386549	1386909	I don't know.
1386909	1388650	All right, Loki.
1388650	1392052	I was going to say the Tower of Glower.
1392052	1393013	Loki, how was your game week?
1394009	1396810	Um, it was pretty much Minecraft.
1396810	1398550	Actually, I think it was all Minecraft.
1398550	1404592	So, I took a couple days off to work on, um, the theme park ride stuff.
1404592	1406792	I didn't end up doing that the entire time.
1406792	1411574	Instead, I did some of the things that are going towards my next episode.
1411574	1417175	Um, so I got, like, two big farms done, and just some other, like, nonsense grinding and stuff.
1417175	1419956	But I did end up working on some of it, though, so I have, uh,
1420996	1429440	I'm like woolboxing out like the rooms and the show buildings and stuff to try to figure out where all that stuff's going to be laid out.
1429440	1442005	So it's still going to be a process, but I'm trying to work on that and then get, you know, episode content ready to go as well so I can put stuff out while I'm working on this big project.
1442694	1446558	Alright, well, good luck.
1446558	1448260	Let's see my gaming week.
1448260	1452024	Honestly, kind of similar stuff to what I usually play Final Fantasy 14.
1452024	1456168	I actually didn't play the Xbox version of Final Fantasy 14 because I just wanted to unlock achievements.
1456168	1457169	That's all.
1457169	1462514	And if you do have Game Pass Ultimate, you can get the starter edition of Final Fantasy 14.
1462514	1465758	And I just installed that on my Xbox, I logged in, and you have to
1466238	1492770	you have to do things to like trigger the checks like you have to kill a mob to get all the mob related achievements you have to finish a quest to get all the quest related achievements so i didn't get everything because unfortunately the raids you have to do by clearing the raid there's no way to just like get them all but i got a good i got probably like a thousand achievement points just from my fall fantasy history just from like loading it up and and doing a few uh little tasks in game but um
1493490	1496774	That's probably all I'll really play of that version for now.
1496774	1500618	I don't know, maybe I'll play on the TV downstairs at some point, but that's where my Series X is hooked up.
1500618	1501899	I did all of this through
1503355	1505557	playing on the network, Remote Play.
1505557	1510920	So I was on my PC, but I was playing the Xbox downstairs, which I do love that system, to be honest.
1510920	1512001	I love the Remote Play stuff.
1512001	1513141	It's been great for that kind of thing.
1513141	1520246	But yeah, because not only did I do it for Final Fantasy XIV, I did it for Diablo IV, because Diablo IV I've also been playing this week.
1520246	1521987	And that came out on Game Pass.
1521987	1522567	Same thing.
1522567	1524048	I went in and got about 250 achievement points.
1525109	1527551	It makes me wish there was a universal achievement system across all platforms.
1541685	1543466	Um, but I know that's where it was something like that.
1543466	1546808	When I had, when I lost stadia, right.
1546808	1548529	I had to redo all of my DB.
1548529	1552271	The only of my DVD things that I did not have to redo is my P three 50.
1552271	1558134	Cause I mean, they're number one, there's no way, but I had logged in on steam just before that ended.
1558134	1561316	And then it would, it would have seen you already had a character that was there.
1561316	1561896	So that's yeah.
1561896	1565758	Cause that's now considered like, it's like their only legacy achievement left.
1565758	1566278	Yeah.
1566278	1567039	Interesting.
1567039	1567359	All right.
1568078	1571342	So yeah, so it was fun to pop the achievements.
1571342	1577188	Otherwise, I've actually been playing Diablo 4 because this weekend they've done an experience boost.
1577188	1581774	And so I'm kind of working on that to level my Barbarian through the current season.
1581774	1583395	I really feel like the battle pass
1583956	1585057	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
1603926	1604526	It's fine.
1604526	1606847	I'll gain progress as I get more achievements.
1606847	1609007	And maybe this will be the first character I get to 100.
1609007	1609387	We'll see.
1609387	1613688	Because the current season got extended because they're doing all this stuff.
1613688	1621050	They're basically reworking the entire loot and endgame system for the next season in response to a lot of the feedback they're getting.
1621050	1624471	So they had to extend this current season by a month, which is fine.
1624471	1625991	It'll give me time to finish it.
1627079	1628040	Diablo 4 is on Game Pass
1641516	1649143	Don't pick up the Final Fantasy XIV Starter Edition on Game Pass if you are not already a subscriber to XIV.
1649143	1653867	If you are a subscriber to XIV already, yes, go get it, get your license set up and all that stuff.
1653867	1665997	If you have never played XIV before, stick with the free edition until you decide you want to stick with it because once you get that starter edition, you can never go back to the free edition and you'll have to pay a monthly sub.
1666638	1667858	If you want to play it.
1667858	1672240	So it's it's another one of those things that I think is way too overcomplicated about the system.
1672240	1676081	But alas, here we are in the year 2024.
1676081	1680142	And we can't simply and they're still charging money for Final Fantasy 11, quite frankly.
1680142	1685984	So, you know, there's certain things that I don't think Square's figured out or Microsoft, to be quite honest.
1685984	1686104	So.
1687349	1696862	Alright, well with that we will get into some gaming news and I guess Loki starting us off with some other things that Microsoft hasn't seemed to figure out such as stopping leaks, right?
1697683	1698403	Exactly.
1698403	1709686	So apparently, well, we kind of knew that this was coming, I think, from some other leaked stuff where they had, you know, talked about future SKUs and stuff like that.
1709686	1720049	But now we have what appears to be a leaked image of an Xbox Series X that is all white and without a disk drive.
1720689	1729942	And apparently it's supposed to be coming out priced under $500 with an improved heatsink but no other major enhancements.
1729942	1731103	I think a larger...
1732130	1732670	DarkSakura
1763723	1764425	I don't know.
1764425	1765086	I wouldn't want this.
1765086	1770297	This looks more like a mini fridge than the normal Series X, so... Who knows?
1771363	1780368	I mean, I understand that digital is where a lot of things are going and that they probably are doing a refresh to maybe try to move more units over the summer and holiday.
1780368	1783369	I don't think this is too big a deal, though.
1783369	1795396	So, yeah, it's I mean, it's nice to have choice, I guess, as long as they're not like saying, oh, yeah, we're going to discontinue the Series X, I guess, as is with the
1798038	1798919	Nintendo Switch 2
1826778	1833300	June will be when we know for sure because either we get something announced for the holiday or nothing is announced at all except more Switch games.
1833300	1841983	But what's interesting, some moving and shakies going on at the official Nintendo testing center, apparently before the Switch 2 becomes a thing.
1842963	1855673	Apparently, some current and former contractors mentioned that there was a massive downsizing that was going on, meaning layoffs with the video game industry were affecting them as well.
1855673	1860697	And these reports about the launch of Switch 2 being delayed until 2025.
1860697	1872026	Nintendo, in a statement, said these changes will involve some contractor assignments ending as well as the creation of a significant number of new full-time employee positions.
1873757	1878819	All I can see in my head is that TikTok of the, you have been promoted.
1878819	1881579	You are now one of my elite employees.
1881579	1890262	Like that's, this is exactly what this Nintendo email sounds like, is we fired that person, but now you've been promoted to this other person.
1890262	1892362	That's exactly what this, I'm sorry.
1892362	1900945	I shouldn't laugh because, you know, some people lost their job and that sucks, but like this, literally, that's what this statement sounds like to me.
1900945	1901885	That's all, if you haven't seen.
1902225	1904827	And of course, I say it's on TikTok.
1904827	1910592	But just like anything on those short video platforms that that videos everywhere, Instagram, Reels, YouTube, whatever.
1910592	1914856	I know you've seen this if you spend any time looking at all those shit posts on those platforms.
1914856	1919480	Anyway, uh, let's see where we're getting more more money.
1919480	1921862	No, I'm afraid we don't have it in the budget.
1923503	1928545	But, uh, NOA will offer severance packages, provide assistance during the transition.
1928545	1932747	Uh, they say we're incredibly grateful for the important contributions, blah, blah, blah.
1932747	1936689	We don't know exactly how many employees this is.
1936689	1947455	Uh, the, the people that kind of leaked this information to the press say it could be about a hundred contractors, but again, we don't really know cause they're not saying exactly what the number is there.
1947455	1949036	So yeah.
1949036	1949116	Um,
1949777	1954938	Also, apparently, the same people that got laid off and squealed to the press
1956104	1969088	Maybe, I don't know, maybe there's a reason, I shouldn't say that, but you know, they have now squealed about none of them, apparently no one there was having any hands-on time with the upcoming Switch 2.
1969088	1980771	So these folks are allegedly confirming that the Switch 2 has not even been testing yet, which would seem to lend credit to it's not happening until 2025, and this restructuring could be
1981531	1985213	As we are getting so maybe they cut out the people that tend to squeal.
1985213	1985593	I don't know.
1985593	1998821	Well, I think this is just if you lay off people and these press companies have anonymous signal accounts, you know, there's there's people that are going to be more than happy to burn their former employer once they realize that loyalty is not there.
1998821	2000001	So, yeah.
2000001	2003543	So maybe that is why they're doing it now.
2003543	2004804	Maybe they won't squeal.
2004804	2005844	Yeah.
2005844	2006084	Anyway.
2007626	2009768	Uh, so that's, that's all what's going on.
2009768	2019378	So just the report there that also the Switch 2 doesn't even appear to have been being tested yet, but perhaps this whole shift is because that's coming soon.
2019378	2021280	So they're kind of locking in the current system.
2021280	2021700	Who knows?
2021700	2022301	We'll see.
2022301	2024243	Anyway, let's move on, DarkSakura.
2026130	2040665	Well, in terms of layoffs and other things happening, Sega is selling off Relic Entertainment and laying off about 240 employees across Europe.
2040665	2041947	They, and this is
2042607	2064159	Their quote about why is that the business environment surrounding the consumer area especially in the European region is rapidly changing and then reactionary decline from the stay-at-home demand in COVID-19 and the economic downturn due to inflation Basically, we ain't making enough money and people ain't going out and spending enough
2065160	2069021	Well, and the same reason every tech company is claiming right now.
2069021	2070221	Yeah.
2070221	2075302	Anyway, it's funny how they talk about like, you know, economic downturn and all that stuff.
2075302	2079502	But yet, $70 games.
2079502	2080103	Yeah.
2080103	2080603	Yeah.
2080603	2083563	I mean, if they want us to buy the games, drop the price point on the game.
2083563	2085563	Oh, no, no, no.
2085563	2088224	Loki, $70 games with a battle pass.
2088224	2090944	With a battle pass and DLC and all other stuff.
2090944	2092305	And loot boxes.
2092305	2094065	And horse armor.
2094065	2094305	Mm hmm.
2095519	2098860	What if I want my horse to be well protected?
2098860	2104062	You have every right you have every right to buy that there's nothing I'm not gonna people can spend money on what they like.
2104062	2105382	Look, I'm part of the problem.
2105382	2107302	I have the Diablo four battle pass.
2107302	2110063	That's part of my I got a $70 game.
2110063	2114825	No, no, no, I got $100 game because I bought the limited edition.
2114825	2116085	And now I have a battle pass.
2116085	2119086	Of course, season one's battle passes was included with that price.
2119086	2120746	But now I bought season two and season three.
2120746	2122287	So I'm part of the problem.
2122287	2122507	So
2127718	2137628	As I was saying, basically something that's coming out of this though is that Relic is going independent.
2137628	2144635	They found an external investor and they are going to continue on their current projects like Company of Heroes 3 and
2148169	2162678	They are still working on the update coming out in April, new content, and of course, their quote on here, we want to thank Sega, whose support over the years and guidance during this transition have been instrumental to our success.
2162678	2167021	We may be out of the Sega business, but we remain friends and colleagues, meaning we ain't burning our bridges.
2168582	2173146	We may even see a return of some previous things that they might have been working at, like when they cancelled Hyenas.
2187818	2189580	So, who knows?
2189580	2191881	Maybe we'll have something.
2191881	2193843	Maybe we'll have something new from them.
2193843	2201228	But, it is... I think it's a pretty good thing that the company itself is surviving.
2201228	2203310	So, we'll see what comes of them.
2204503	2206204	Alright, we sure will.
2206204	2212449	It's nice to hear at least that you know, the studio was goes independent as opposed to just closing.
2212449	2215531	So yeah, somewhat of a nice footnote.
2215531	2216391	All right.
2216391	2218653	It's something.
2218653	2222276	Well, Loki, let's talk about that economy for another company.
2222276	2224057	Yeah, let's talk about it.
2224057	2225638	So GameStop.
2225638	2226959	Yeah, still struggling.
2227415	2234679	Who would have thought that they didn't make all their money back with the crazy stock prices that they had.
2234679	2237200	And the NFT marketplace didn't make them billionaires.
2237200	2240122	I just thought that that would take off.
2240122	2244164	Their independent software store that they were in.
2244164	2246646	Who could have predicted the flop of NFTs?
2246646	2247566	Who?
2247566	2248687	Who could have predicted that?
2249378	2250959	No one could have predicted that.
2250959	2252981	It's just ridiculous.
2252981	2262829	But yeah, so they apparently are having some financial trouble because, you know, sales are starting to go more digital.
2262829	2268874	And especially now that we have, you know, more consoles going all digital as well.
2269824	2272125	That's obviously eating into their profits.
2272125	2281689	So, apparently, GameStop said earlier that their earnings for 2023, their fourth quarter, totaled $1.79 billion compared to the same period in 2022.
2281689	2284850	That was $2.23 billion, so a 20% decline in sales overall.
2295414	2308182	They say that the increasing mix of digital downloads is hurting physical retail and there is simply no reason to go to the store if a consumer can just order the game and download it immediately.
2308182	2314726	Revenues are highly unlikely to rebound unless management figures out ways to drive store traffic.
2314726	2321371	I mean, yeah, kind of like so, like actually this week I did end up going into a GameStop.
2321371	2322431	We were killing time.
2325201	2332388	We were killing time, but there's not a lot in there anymore.
2332388	2346882	They have their huge wall of Funko Pops, they have a lot of video game memorabilia type stuff, PC hardware even, peripherals and whatnot, but there's not a lot that really
2348524	2349786	Screams out I gotta buy this.
2349786	2356753	Plus when you think about it, there's a lot of games out there now where the physical edition is just a case and a download code.
2356753	2363361	And so it doesn't make sense to go in and go purchase that through a physical retailer.
2365472	2371916	to just, you know, essentially get the same thing just with extra garbage that you're going to throw away.
2371916	2376758	Um, on top of that, like I think even the discounts on their games weren't even very good.
2376758	2385743	Like I was looking at even used copies and it's just like a few bucks cheaper than what it is normally for games that have been out for a very long time.
2385743	2388525	Like I think Skyrim on the Switch was still $50.
2388525	2394148	I was like, no, I'm not buying it for that price.
2394148	2394248	Um,
2395680	2397381	So I don't know.
2397381	2402505	They've been struggling for a while, but they didn't do anything smart with their extra... They're loading themselves along.
2402505	2405366	In part, I'm kind of surprised they're still there, to be honest.
2405366	2412972	Yeah, I mean, they didn't do anything as far as, you know, utilizing the extra capital they have to do something meaningful.
2412972	2414513	Instead, they chased trends, which...
2415561	2418203	I mean, anybody could have told them we're going to fail.
2418203	2423006	Well, and I feel like they're also chasing trends a little bit behind the curve is what's happening.
2423006	2432232	And again, yet again, management not being, you know, having the foresight, you know, investing in dumb things like NFT and, you know, Funko Pops.
2432232	2441078	Sure, I understand they're popular, but I also I don't know, am I just being an old funny daddy feeling like the bubble on Funko Pops is mostly bursts?
2441078	2443200	Like I know people still collect them, but I feel like
2444694	2448757	is it is the demand there for those things to be in like every GameStop across the country?
2448757	2449778	I don't think so.
2449778	2451219	I don't know.
2451219	2465388	And like, honestly, with that type of stuff, like they're so large, like I just wouldn't have... Funko Pops are in Hot Topic, Box Lunch, they're in every fucking Spencer Gifts, they're in every fucking store, right?
2465388	2469731	And but and to that to to that sense as well,
2470672	2486445	Like, yeah, cool, there's Funko Pops at GameStop, but, like, if I'm searching for a Funko Pop for something specific, I go on the internet and search for it and order it online and have it shipped to my door.
2486445	2491269	Like, I don't need to go into GameStop to go see, ooh, what Funko Pops do you got in here?
2491269	2493551	Unless they're doing, like, bicycle trade of that stuff, which,
2495100	2496521	What's the point at that point?
2496521	2498523	Um, but I don't know.
2498523	2507310	There's just, it's, it's not, we're not in a landscape where we used to be where pre-internet, yeah, they, they had a list of like, here's what's coming out.
2507310	2515296	And it was like, Oh, I need to go to them for my, my information on what I should order and all that stuff or what I should pick up.
2515296	2518919	And now it's like, I don't need them because I have the internet.
2518919	2519259	I have,
2520246	2522809	Millions of different YouTubers out there reviewing different things.
2538567	2539948	WhatSquare is able to do.
2539948	2543989	And so people are incentivized to just buy it right there online.
2543989	2547250	You know, that's one example, but many games are like this at this point.
2547250	2551512	It's just, I think GameStop, you know, the used game market is still a thing.
2551512	2563897	And I think GameStop can exist somewhat on that front, but I think they also need to really lean into, I do think the right shift is to shift into like nerd culture types of those sorts of things.
2563897	2565638	Again, I think of a store like BoxLunch,
2566198	2567901	And I enjoy those stores and I go into them all.
2567901	2568842	I think they're neat.
2568842	2572468	And one thing I think they do very well, they're split up into these different sections.
2572468	2575372	So like, you can go to like, oh, here's the Star Wars section.
2575372	2577316	Here's the Harry Potter section.
2577316	2581262	Although if you're a Harry Potter fan in 2024, anyway, that's a whole other subject.
2581642	2585384	GameStop would be smart to make a similar pivot
2599289	2599850	DarkSakura
2620649	2644566	what's that one it used to be attic salt and they changed their name to something else something fire I don't know but they it can kind of hold its own against a lot of these companies that just sell neat stuff like if GameStop had a Final Fantasy section because let me tell you 14 players a battle net Overwatch Wow stuff you know but not just old shirts that you can get online but like really like cool other memorabilia and stuff
2645146	2650330	Yeah, they need to have a, they need to differentiate themselves with this stuff.
2650330	2662718	You can, I mean, I hate to say this cause we hated the GameStop exclusive nonsense when it came to like pre-order stuff, but, but for the sake, for the sake of their business, they need to have something that only you can get at GameStop.
2662718	2672324	Whether, I don't necessarily think it needs to be products, but it could be just like a service or something, but it's, it's hard to say what that would be in this day and age.
2672324	2673065	It would just be.
2674741	2678645	I mean, I don't know, like Landcenter type gaming or something.
2678645	2679987	I don't know what to get people in the store.
2679987	2681508	Especially with that type of merchandise.
2681508	2684872	You can also expect that sometimes stores are going to have exclusives, right?
2684872	2695163	Like, for example, if you have an expensive coach bag, you had to get that from a coach store or a back alley in New York City that looks really, really, really similar.
2695163	2695743	Or Goodwill.
2696684	2724200	but you get my you get my drift you know you kind of expect that you know to get these sorts of exclusives you're gonna you have to go to certain stores that's that's especially when it comes to like shirts and and clothing and things like that that's not i don't think that's too wild to expect that you know they're they're gonna have and we we've uh what we just had the final fantasy shirt collection was it uniclo right that that's the type of thing that should have been a gamestop thing why did gamestop let uniclo have that
2724580	2727101	Now, don't get me wrong, I love Uniqlo, so I'm glad they did.
2727101	2732843	But that's the type of shit that GameStop needs to be fighting for, not fucking NFTs.
2732843	2742466	And Funko Pops, which, by the way, in chat, DJ Ranma S says, the Funko Pop bubble burst last year when they wrote off $30 million of merchandise, dumping them in the trash.
2742466	2750188	Look, I don't want to... I've gotten in trouble for speaking ill of Funko Pops on this program before, and I'm not planning to do that.
2750188	2752969	But, you know, I do think it's the type of thing where it's like,
2754164	2758745	It's a it's I think when I think of Funko Pops, I think of anime conventions and gaming conventions.
2758745	2761346	That's the type of place where you expect to buy and sell that stuff.
2761346	2765908	Not every fucking nerd store in America is just a lot.
2765908	2768028	And Target.
2768028	2770729	Yes, Target has quite a few of those.
2770729	2771790	A lot.
2771790	2775171	And I feel like even the bubbles bursting with the Target supply and all that stuff, too.
2775171	2776071	So anyway.
2777580	2786644	All right, well moving on here's here's another thing that you know, again, GameStop might want to get on this because I think a lot of people are going to be very excited about this.
2786644	2791166	And it's it's GameStop won't sell a single copy of this game.
2791940	2792360	Marvel Rivals
2811934	2812314	Play
2828283	2844479	It's a 6v6 team-based shooter, it will be free to play, and the universe is said to be continually evolving, so new heroes, new villains, new maps, new challenges, all the same shit you expect from a product that is inspired by Overwatch.
2844479	2846762	Apparently the alpha launch will be out in May.
2847142	2857610	and some of the characters you can play when the first testing version goes up will be Spider-Man, Black Panther, Magneto, Magic, and apparently some other unannounced characters.
2857610	2865657	Developers did mention characters like Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Hulk, and Iron Man will be playable, but not known if that's in the alpha or not.
2865657	2870120	We've also seen screenshots with Doctor Strange, Storm, Scarlet Witch.
2870120	2870621	Let's be real.
2871201	2874183	There is a very large Marvel roster for them to choose from.
2874183	2879525	And even if your favorite character is not in the game when this game releases, they probably could come out eventually.
2879525	2880006	I mean, what?
2880006	2882387	There's like 80,000 things in the Marvel roster.
2882387	2884368	There's who knows who knows.
2884368	2885229	Anyway, um,
2886369	2892614	So again, more to come when we get the testing in May, so check that out.
2892614	2901581	But I know a lot of people that are into Overwatch are keeping an eye on this one because, you know, Overwatch 2 has had it a little bit rough.
2901581	2902402	I don't know.
2902402	2911269	I'm very curious how these next few months treat Overwatch 2 now that they are no longer under Activision and you're already seeing change happen.
2911929	2916112	For example, they released a brand new hero this weekend, Venture.
2916112	2918514	And Venture's a new hero that you can... Is that the name?
2918514	2919355	Venture?
2919355	2922057	Or was it... Yeah, I think so.
2922057	2922277	Maybe.
2922277	2923639	Okay, yeah, I think their name was Venture.
2923639	2930524	It was something with a V. But Venture's a new hero that was available on the live servers for just this weekend.
2930524	2934067	And when Season 10 comes out, they are going to be included.
2934067	2937130	You're not going to have to get them through the Battle Pass or anything like that.
2937130	2938571	They're just a character you're going to pick up.
2939171	2939772	as well.
2960055	2975980	In all of the announcement posts and the bio posts, Venture is using they them pronouns which is very exciting for non-binary individuals that would like to see some representation in games and Overwatch 2 has done a lot of representation very well so we have
2977105	2978546	who appears to be our first.
2978546	2982727	I don't know if Blizzard has actually come out and said they are non-binary.
2982727	2984227	I've seen articles that said that.
2984227	2984547	Yeah.
2984547	2990609	Well, the articles are inferring it based on the Blizzard post because Blizzard is not using any other pronouns besides they them.
2990609	2995051	But Blizzard never came out and said Venture is a non-binary hero, at least as far as I know.
2995051	2999232	It's just in all the promotional materials people noticed.
2999232	3001193	But this is this is the hilarious thing.
3002329	3004992	because I was because I was doing what I shouldn't do.
3004992	3008415	And I was reading the comment section, especially it was on Facebook.
3008415	3011658	This is actually where I saw the new hero announced was on Facebook.
3011658	3017243	And everybody in the comments was intentionally trying to misgender this character.
3017243	3024711	But the problem is, half of them are saying she and half of them are saying he because
3025967	3035292	They don't know, and that's kind of what's sort of awesome about this, and Blizzard simply just letting this be a fucking fact.
3036581	3038461	they them deal with it.
3038461	3044983	Like I don't know there's something there's something very fascinating about watching this play out and watching the trolls play themselves.
3044983	3046483	I don't know what it is.
3046483	3051804	But I find it very fascinating as frustrating as as much as it makes me weep for humanity.
3051804	3059146	So anyway, Phil of nine and chat says, Rob, we got to turn your parental controls back on.
3059146	3060666	Stay out of the comments.
3060666	3060846	Yeah.
3061246	3062067	right.
3062067	3078639	Mike def does bring back an interesting point here is Mike def says I say a but that's because in Spanish we don't have non binary pronouns and I believe that's where the whole like Latin x was coming from in part right or
3079780	3084882	I think there's a whole debate on that whole thing right now, actually, that I'm not sure I want to wade into.
3084882	3090524	But yes, you know, because and I don't think Spanish is the only language that's extremely gendered.
3090524	3092225	There's a lot of languages where words change.
3092225	3092825	French.
3092825	3093246	Yeah.
3093246	3099988	There's a lot of languages rooted in change based on, you know, whether a person is male or female.
3099988	3101589	So, yeah.
3103781	3111123	SH100mat says, yeah, folks made a stink about Morph being non-binary for X-Men 97, but they got over it because the series has been good.
3111123	3113804	I didn't even, I need to watch X-Men 97, man.
3113804	3115925	Apparently it's, apparently it's really good.
3115925	3116665	It's really good.
3116665	3117185	Yeah.
3117185	3117705	Yeah.
3117705	3119586	I need to sit down and watch it.
3119586	3126508	Um, but, but I mean, but it makes sense to somebody who doesn't technically have a form with any defining features.
3128297	3129078	DarkSakura
3154085	3157572	So, um, we remember the play date.
3157572	3162021	I mean, certain people on this podcast own one, right?
3162021	3163083	Certain people want one.
3165325	3168467	$40,000 worth of them have gone missing.
3168467	3174771	There were two pallets at a shopping center in Las Vegas and they're gone.
3174771	3177853	They went missing.
3177853	3179514	It's a heist!
3179514	3184998	It got on that train even though it was in Las Vegas and probably at a store.
3184998	3192823	But yeah, they were looking at the inventory numbers at the shopping center in Las Vegas and some of the numbers didn't add up.
3193303	3197967	and they found that two pallets of them were unaccounted for.
3197967	3206355	And so, yeah, it's like the shopping center said FedEx claimed that they were delivered, but they have no trace of them.
3206355	3215604	And then another set of pallets that were eventually recovered ended up being delivered to a construction site of a Circle K next door to the shopping center.
3219192	3222753	Strange things are afoot at the Circle K. Right.
3222753	3238702	But the person, Cable Sasser, who's the co-founder of Playdate, showed a picture of the pallet just sitting there in the open, and then someone went to go get them.
3241497	3249645	But yeah, the same person was supposed to sign off on both of the palettes, and they signed off on the ones that were at the construction site.
3249645	3257572	So I think that person is probably promoted to customer at that shopping center.
3257572	3259514	You have been demoted!
3259514	3263918	No, no, it's promoted to customer.
3265580	3267501	TigerClaw in chats asks, could it be an inside job?
3292272	3298840	Did they drive a bunch of minis in and load them up into little minis and then drive off with them through a sewer?
3307390	3308471	It'd be really hard to flip all those, too.
3308471	3309231	Like, it's a pretty niche console.
3309231	3312032	Like, I get people that want it, but it's still pretty niche.
3329341	3336203	And they'll they'll end up on like street vendors and those those sorts of things where people just go, oh, it's a neat little system.
3336203	3349887	I know folks in chat are saying eBay, but I feel like eBay is a lot maybe some of oil, but I feel like eBay is a lot more traceable to although would they I don't know if they'd necessarily be able to know that this was something that was taken off a pallet or it's a legit sale.
3349887	3350047	So
3351067	3352929	Podculture suggests Teemu.
3352929	3354551	Maybe that's that's where they're getting their deals.
3354551	3355012	I don't know.
3355012	3360037	No, but you know, it's it is wild to think about where these things might be being flipped.
3360037	3362240	All right.
3362240	3366324	Sean322 in chat says GameStop exclusive Play Day handhelds.
3366324	3368467	Oh, maybe that's GameStop's new business model.
3373549	3391154	To be fair, carrying the Playdate in their store wouldn't be viable for them because that's an entirely digital console, but that piece of hardware being in a store would be something that's exclusive
3391914	3394256	to that store because it's right now it's only available online.
3394256	3411229	So like that would be something that I could see like almost like feels like they should be kind of going the whole Netflix route in the sense that they have or maybe even like Netflix, Amazon, where they have like people that are creating custom like software games for their platform.
3411229	3415312	So like GameStop almost needs to be like a publisher at some point and publish their own things.
3415312	3415412	But
3417193	3419513	Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually.
3419513	3421434	They don't have the money to sink into that either.
3421434	3425055	So like it's.
3425055	3431396	Have you tried serving pizza at the restaurant or at your store to like, you know, pizza and games?
3431396	3433616	You know, it's worked for Chuck E. Cheese.
3433616	3435216	You know, why not?
3435216	3435436	Yeah.
3435436	3437537	Why not just become a place instead of trying to sell?
3437537	3439137	Just become an arcade.
3439137	3440037	Arcade and pizza.
3440037	3440998	Just like pivot.
3440998	3442098	Completely pivot.
3442098	3443018	Arcade pizza.
3443018	3443298	All right.
3444150	3446685	Anyway, for now, let's talk about other business decisions, Loki.
3447799	3462011	Uh, yeah, so, uh, you know, I've forgot that Gearbox was owned by the Embracer Group, which sucks because, you know, with their financial troubles that they're in, you know, what does that mean for Gearbox and their Borderlands series and whatnot?
3462011	3475843	Well, thankfully, you know, it is Gearbox and, uh, because of that, you know, and their partnerships with Take-Two Interactive in the past, they have now been, um, acquired by Take-Two Interactive.
3478166	3489222	They paid $460 million to acquire them, whereas Embracer bought them originally for $1.3 billion.
3489222	3491084	Yikes, a little bit of a sale there.
3493305	3503469	But yeah, so they're going to be... Embracer is going to still retain the rights to some parts of Gearbox's business.
3503469	3506051	Like some of the games I think that they've published.
3506051	3510012	Publishing rights to Remnant Franchise and the upcoming Hyper Light Breaker.
3512904	3529339	And they're also going to publish some unannounced games as well, but everything's going to be folded into Take-Two Interactive, I'd imagine, under the 2K Games moniker as well, because, I mean, that's where they've been publishing a lot of their games previously.
3529339	3535545	Yeah, this kind of is a very logical sort of leap because, yeah, 2K has been doing a lot of publishing, so it's interesting.
3535956	3538037	Yeah, so cool.
3538037	3539518	Glad to see that they're not going under.
3539518	3540598	Yeah, exactly.
3540598	3543079	That's with a lot of the Embracer related things lately.
3543079	3544280	I feel like that's the common theme.
3544280	3546140	Well, I'm glad they're not going under.
3546140	3546861	That's for sure.
3546861	3548041	Yeah, that's for sure.
3548041	3552103	And then, yeah, so I'm excited to see.
3552103	3557265	I hear they're working on Borderlands 4, so can't wait to find out more about that.
3557265	3559726	I mean, especially if they time it for the movie.
3559726	3560967	Make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
3560967	3561347	So we'll see.
3562526	3569969	All right, well, before we get to one of our favorite segments here at Orange Alliance Radio, I do have an important update about Twitch streaming culture.
3569969	3576332	I'm sorry to announce you may no longer stream playing video games on your butt.
3576332	3577652	Yes, this was a thing.
3577652	3579933	Yeah, this was a thing that some streamers were doing.
3579933	3582514	That's where I only play video games is on my butt.
3582514	3584415	Well, what you do at home is your own business.
3584415	3591518	But some folks on Twitch were using green screen tricks to green screen like you wear a pair of green
3592093	3599856	Briefs or panties or a bra or something and you can actually play a video game on your body part.
3599856	3614181	Unfortunately, Twitch is now officially prohibiting content that focuses on clothed intimate body parts, such as the buttocks, groin, or breasts for extended periods of time.
3614181	3617382	Twitch said that in a statement and it was immediately banned by Microsoft.
3618117	3619258	No, I'm kidding.
3619258	3623263	But Twitch did say that in a statement on March 29th.
3623263	3626127	Our community guidelines are designed to help make Twitch a welcoming place.
3626127	3626547	Okay, look.
3627662	3628062	I get it.
3628062	3631624	Like, like Twitch just, it is very interesting.
3631624	3638588	It just goes to show, draw a line and people, people like fucking people like fucking cats.
3638588	3639789	No, they won't cross it.
3639789	3641650	They will walk up to the line.
3641650	3643151	They'll sniff around the line.
3643151	3647553	They'll try to put a finger past the line or a butt past the line and see what they can get away with.
3647553	3651115	People will try to get away with anything and everything.
3651115	3655737	If you don't know, if they could, if they could cross that line, they would pogo stick right over it.
3655737	3656498	Absolutely.
3656818	3657579	Well, that's the thing.
3657579	3665523	It's like the people that there are certain individuals on Twitch that are the ones pushing these metas, trying to skirt the line.
3665523	3667164	Just ban them.
3667164	3668865	Just ban them already.
3668865	3670166	Like, what was this?
3670166	3672548	Like, no, permanently ban them.
3672548	3673748	Like- It's not gonna last.
3673748	3674749	They're gonna make another account.
3675894	3702014	that's a ban evasion and they get banned again because like for example Morgpie is one of the ones that's you always see her name when it's coming to these different metas trying to escape you know skirt by the rules and it's just the other reason I was on there is to try it I was just linked to something here oh I can't oh I was going to show it and then I realized that but that's a bad decision you will have to look at the link that TigerClaw dropped in chat because if I show this
3703297	3703537	I can't.
3734838	3735538	I don't know.
3735538	3740801	I would just say ban these people because they're just going to keep coming back doing different things like this.
3740801	3743342	Um, or ask yourself, should they be part?
3743342	3743662	I don't know.
3743662	3744603	Is this person partnered?
3744603	3748545	I'm assuming they are because they probably I'm sure it was easy for them to meet the criteria.
3748545	3748665	Um,
3750217	3754541	you know, ask yourself, do you want to be partners with these types of streamers?
3754541	3760167	And look, I, I understand sex workers work, that's fine.
3760167	3766373	You know, but there are also websites there, there is very explicitly a competitor- Just making OnlyFans like everyone else does.
3766373	3767854	They have an Only- that's the thing.
3767854	3770477	They're using Twitch to drive traffic to that.
3770477	3771438	That's the whole point.
3771618	3779225	There is legitimately a competitor to Twitch where folks are encouraged to play video games and be naked.
3779225	3782247	I can't tell you what it is, but you can go find it.
3782247	3784029	It's not hard to find.
3784029	3788933	Just take a stick and see if it points you in the right direction.
3788933	3789914	It's out there.
3789914	3798662	But if Twitch wants to draw the line for advertiser dollars to keep the place in business, then that's what they have to do.
3801846	3804548	I would also encourage you not to put the website in chat.
3804548	3812574	You can do whatever you want on Discord, I guess, within reason, but don't do it in chat, because I'm sure some of you are like, oh, Rob is talking about... I wouldn't do that.
3812574	3813254	All right.
3813254	3819359	Yeah, Rob is talking about... Yes, I've suddenly become the cartoon strip Kathy.
3819359	3821761	I'm talking about... All right.
3821761	3821961	Yes.
3824036	3824456	Cathy's Retirement
3844184	3846485	And fuck you, especially.
3846485	3847586	And where's my raise?
3847586	3850067	And I'm gonna go and be a political blah blah.
3850067	3851068	No, I didn't.
3851068	3851588	I don't know.
3851588	3853209	Now I'm thinking of that TikTok.
3853209	3853569	Here I am.
3853569	3855410	Apparently this is Rob thinks of TikTok.
3855410	3857011	But I'm thinking of that old lady.
3857011	3858732	And it's always like people repost it.
3858732	3866276	And it says like me reporting to work at Monday after my two hour nap or something is this old lady going, what?
3866276	3867577	What?
3867577	3868037	Fuck you.
3871524	3874105	Oh, yeah, that's me.
3874105	3877046	Except I just think it really loudly.
3877046	3879847	All right.
3879847	3887750	Let's let's get to a orange right and chat says Kathy's resignation rated M for mature.
3887750	3888630	All right.
3888630	3890971	Rated M for yeah, motherfucker.
3890971	3891972	No.
3891972	3897294	Let's get to a popular segment here on the show, which may or may not be rated M for mature.
3897294	3898014	It's the classic of the week.
3908556	3916301	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3916301	3919683	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3919683	3922985	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic game this week?
3922985	3924746	I picked Metamorphic Force.
3926297	3927598	Yay!
3927598	3941165	It is an arcade game that was released by Konami in 1993 and it is one of Konami's last side-scrolling beat-em-ups along with Violent Storm.
3941165	3944807	It actually is a lot like X-Men in the arcade.
3944807	3948148	It runs on the same hardware as Mystic Warriors.
3949329	3963813	So just a basic recap of this game is that the evil King Deathshadow... I mean, that's not what you name your firstborn if you expect them to not be an evil emperor.
3965287	3971651	The ruler of the empire of horror has risen from the dead to take over everything.
3971651	3973793	And Athena's like, bitch, no.
3973793	3984400	So she summons the souls of four ancient guardians and charged them up with her mojo and sent them to stop the evil.
3984400	3988543	And they can turn into different beasts.
3988543	3992026	So kind of like altered beasts, but better.
3992746	3994467	a lot better.
3994467	4000410	So you play as Bon, who is a martial artist, and he turns into a fighting bull.
4000410	4003472	His beast form is a minotaur.
4003472	4006453	His guardian, sorry, is a fighting bull, so he turns into a minotaur.
4006453	4009315	You have Claude, who is a swordsman with a rapier.
4009315	4011576	He turns into a werewolf.
4011576	4015838	Max, a fighter who's a boxer, turns into a werepanther.
4015838	4019720	And Ivan, who is a hunter and wrestler, turns into a werebear.
4021315	4029178	And so you get into your beast mode and collect a power-up from golden statues.
4029178	4031119	And you eventually will get there.
4031119	4040743	There's also this rodent creature that shows up and gives you a health item or a gold statue or something for your score.
4040743	4044464	And they drop other power-ups.
4044464	4047906	If you attack the little ratman, then...
4050934	4057200	I don't know what he does if you attack him.
4057200	4063406	He'll drop power-ups because he's all shook and runs away.
4063406	4070453	But when you get a statue when you're already in beast mode, you get a screen attack, which destroys everything on screen.
4070453	4075277	And if it's collected during a boss fight, the boss is hit super hard and twice.
4077359	4098290	So you have other anthropomorphic creatures that you fight, like frog folks, and lizards, and hedgehogs, and heffalump mans, and boars, and then your bosses, you have one called Cabrios the Ram Man, who looks like Baphomet, and you have Scythe, who is a flaming chicken man.
4098290	4099651	You're fighting BBQ Chicken then?
4100711	4106172	and then a demoness who turns into a dragon.
4106172	4108233	So you've got a bunch of other stuff.
4108233	4109813	So there was a U.S.
4109813	4112334	version and a Japanese version.
4112334	4112934	The U.S.
4112934	4118715	version has a numeric life counter that also doubles as your timer.
4118715	4123496	It goes down by one life point each tick, kind of like Gauntlet, right?
4123496	4126197	The Japanese version uses a traditional health bar.
4127677	4139841	The 5th stage in the US has a boss rush, where you basically fight everybody until you get to the end boss, but in Japanese version you only fight at-level bosses.
4139841	4142142	At-levels boss, sorry.
4142142	4149445	Some of the sprites have been really altered, like stained glass artwork in the elevator has been changed in the US one.
4151867	4166121	Game Machine in Japan Magazine listed Metamorphic Force on their September 15, 1993 issue as being the 17th most successful arcade unit of the month.
4166121	4170185	A lot of places gave it really good ratings.
4170185	4171867	The soundtrack got released
4173608	4182759	In the CDs collection, Konami Amusement Sounds 93 Autumn Edition.
4182759	4188906	Also, one other thing about the game system.
4190265	4200312	that should be pointed out is that the model DD6 and model DD7 of the Bemani games originate from this game.
4200312	4210118	So the model DD6 is used on stage 2 and 7 boss battles, while model DD7 is used for stage 5's boss battle.
4210118	4214081	And, you know, again, these went into the Bemani games.
4215137	4216239	So there you go.
4216239	4219566	The game is Metamorphic Force.
4219566	4222191	It is pretty badass.
4222191	4225998	And I think the action is definitely a lot faster than Altered Beast.
4225998	4227221	I have more fun playing this.
4229599	4231500	How did I not really know about this game?
4231500	4232681	Maybe I did play this.
4232681	4234543	I think maybe I did play this, but I forgot.
4234543	4236264	This was arcade only, remember?
4236264	4237185	Yeah, no, I know.
4237185	4241788	But, you know, they used to have cool arcade games at Golf Land once upon a time.
4241788	4249234	I feel like I played or like Scandia or one of the one of those, you know, you know, the arcade, maybe maybe even the bowling alley, what I recall.
4249234	4253877	I'm pretty sure that I played this in an arcade in Dothan, Alabama at the old Tilt Arcade.
4255606	4258167	and Tilt Arcade takes me back.
4258167	4259727	Some comments about this game in our chat.
4259727	4263148	Orange Rite says Konami sure like to make the US versions quarter suckers.
4263148	4265428	Yeah, well, that's that's the business, right?
4265428	4275191	Quest Buster says if I recall correctly, the animated look Konami used for this game was also reminiscent of that used in Gaiaopolis, Gaiaopolis, which also ran on the same hardware.
4275191	4277231	There you go.
4277231	4277571	All right.
4277571	4282412	Well, there is your classic game of the week.
4282412	4283893	Metamorphic Force.
4283893	4284153	Thank you.
4285103	4285683	Hmm, fun.
4285683	4287665	I have to check that one out.
4287665	4301575	It also also kind of, you know, we had a little joke intro tonight about altered the game altered beast and this game kind of reminds me about that the whole like beast fighting type of thing is kind of a little bit I thought it was ironic you did that when I chose this game.
4301575	4301915	Yes.
4301915	4305397	I didn't know if you made them tighten with each other, but it's awfully funny.
4305397	4305798	Unintended.
4305798	4307879	There was supposed to be a different joke with that bumper there.
4307879	4313003	And it's just unintended that you know, because remember, the beginning of altered beast is rise from your grave.
4313263	4314525	Weiss, Omiyogwob
4325400	4328462	Tigerclaw in chat says, I've never seen this arcade game in my life.
4328462	4332425	So it's nice to hear about classic arcade games you never heard of because you never seen them around back in your days.
4332425	4332745	Yeah.
4332745	4336768	I mean, not not every game that existed always made its way to your local arcade.
4336768	4340970	So or it was there for like six weeks and then didn't do well and was gone.
4340970	4342771	And then Namco would buy your arcade.
4342771	4343392	Yes.
4343392	4346154	Or any of those types of things, too, for sure.
4346154	4347374	All right.
4347374	4351097	Let's check out some other news in a segment we call Rapid Fire News, Loki.
4352455	4364941	Alright, so we have news that Earthblade, the next game from Extremely Okay Games, the folks behind Celeste, it's been delayed.
4364941	4369163	It's not coming out until, I think, next year now.
4369163	4377047	Yeah, it was originally going to have a 2024 release window, but... Yeah, it's going to be a little bit later now.
4377047	4378788	So, yeah.
4379477	4379958	It's good.
4379958	4380920	I can't wait.
4380920	4385149	Celeste was awesome.
4385149	4388074	And then this is a bit of funniness.
4389608	4416430	So I saw this on Twitter actually, but Katsuhiro Hirata of the Tekken franchise was asking fans, because I guess there's been this grassroots effort to try to get him to put Waffle House into the new Tekken game as an official stage, because they want to have people battling out of Waffle House.
4416430	4416750	And he's like,
4417831	4420916	Okay, I'm only gonna ask this once.
4420916	4423120	Why do people keep requesting the Waffle House?
4423120	4424642	Like, he didn't understand the context behind it.
4424642	4426565	Yeah, hello, I am from a different country.
4426565	4430051	Why are you all obsessed with the idea of people battling at a Waffle House?
4430051	4431513	It's like, somebody has to explain the meme.
4434878	4435659	It was funny, though.
4435659	4448168	The responses that were hilarious with like, you know, images of the woman like batting the chair out of the way as it flies through the air and just like, you know, essentially letting them know that, hey, well, it's because it's known for a lot of fighting.
4448168	4450590	And so I think it'd be funny to play in any fighting game.
4450590	4452531	That should be the advertising at Waffle House.
4452531	4455414	It's a place to fight.
4455414	4457135	OK, maybe it's not fighting off those urges.
4457135	4458816	We do.
4458816	4460678	Fighting your colon about 30 minutes later.
4462216	4462636	That's it.
4462636	4466400	We, we, new, new dream game suggestion, I think.
4466400	4468842	And, and, you know, hear me out.
4468842	4474747	We have a pilot like Backroads Battler.
4474747	4488838	And like you have like fighting happen, like at a Waffle House and then like at like a convenience store, you know, you're fighting like the people who try to jump on a robber, you know?
4490007	4496154	or you have it at, uh, what's another place a lot of people get in fights at?
4496154	4497595	Uh, post office?
4497595	4499117	Uh, the kid's little league game.
4500086	4501347	Yeah, no, no.
4501347	4504188	Backstage at a kid's ballet.
4504188	4505209	Oh, Dance Moms.
4505209	4505949	Yes, Dance Moms.
4505949	4508131	We have a Dance Moms area.
4508131	4514995	And we we just we just call this, you know, like I said, American Backroads Battler.
4514995	4517076	America Fight.
4517076	4518036	Yeah.
4518036	4520758	SSU 100 Mountain Chats says Waffle House final destination.
4520758	4524780	No items, five stock.
4524780	4525301	All right.
4525301	4525661	Anyway.
4527067	4528288	DarkSakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire?
4528288	4538452	And there'll be level fatalities where like someone gets a waffle, not a waffle, well done, but like a hash brown smother coverage chunked, you know, land on them.
4538452	4540313	All right.
4540313	4544254	You know, I think I think that would be be beautiful.
4544254	4545295	Take us to another story.
4546852	4552294	Okay, how about some Capcom stuff?
4552294	4558217	They have revealed the most popular games and comments from the fan survey that a bunch of us did.
4558217	4561338	I'm pissed!
4561338	4573223	But according to the graphic below, the biggest things that came up in votes, and this isn't like just titles and everything, it doesn't...
4575089	4591892	but there's like that it looks like it's more it almost looks like it's more of like a yeah it says it's a text my from a text mining tool so i think this is better it's one of those word clouds that corporations love just parses a bunch of text and yeah it's just a fucking word yeah
4592893	4596517	I mean Veronica's on there, I would reckon that's from Code Veronica.
4596517	4604164	But the biggest names on there are Dino Crisis, Mega Man, Capcom, Remake, Game, and Thank You.
4604164	4610090	And then going with Remake and Game respectively, we have Ace Attorney Remake and Resident Evil Game.
4611191	4617454	Um, Rival is on there, Street Fighter is, but it's like, it's really, they're schools.
4617454	4619855	They have schools in larger.
4619855	4623476	Uh, so maybe it's larger than Dragon's Dogma for what it's worth.
4623476	4624937	So I don't know.
4624937	4626737	We just need to be louder, everybody.
4626737	4628178	We need to be louder.
4628178	4628478	Okay.
4629794	4636321	We need to get up on our little soapboxes and scream out to the masses.
4636321	4644671	We need more... Okay, well, DT says Rival Schools is bigger on their Japanese list, although I don't know why it wouldn't say Shiri to Justice Gakuen.
4645812	4661004	Um, but, you know, we need to stand up and say, give us our rival school slash she beats Justice Gakuen and, uh, give us, uh, another Red Earth.
4661004	4662885	Give me cake and Cyberbots.
4662885	4667269	Give me cake or give me rival schools.
4667269	4668329	Now, those are the three.
4668329	4674254	I know I said what I said, because I want another Cyberbots, too, because don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.
4677003	4686707	DJ Ranma S in chat says, Hey Capcom, give us Rival Schools 3 or else we riot.
4686707	4688688	That's, that's, that'll, that'll get it done.
4688688	4689428	That's for sure.
4689428	4690948	New version, Riot Schools.
4690948	4692309	Hey, no, we don't need that.
4692309	4692909	Guess what?
4692909	4699051	Complaining sometimes works because I always bitch and moan about how much I love the Commodore 64 and I want more crap.
4699051	4700292	And guess what's coming out more?
4700692	4703574	Commodore 64 iconery crap.
4703574	4709019	This is the accessory maker 8bitdo is releasing a mechanical keyboard.
4709019	4715564	They did one based on the NES and Famicom before, but this one is going to be based off the Commodore 64.
4715564	4716064	That's right.
4716064	4721909	It is a mechanical keyboard, but it looks like, you guessed it, a Commodore 64 keyboard.
4721909	4724531	And I have to say, it does look kind of cool.
4724531	4727754	I don't know if I would actually be able to use one of these like as my main keyboard,
4728214	4729354	But I think it is pretty badass.
4729354	4734816	And I love that in this mock photo somebody took, they actually have like a game playing on a Commodore monitor.
4734816	4739937	So yeah, I don't know for what like actual use I would have for this keyboard, but I think it does look really cool.
4739937	4741077	Let's see.
4741077	4744198	It's a USB, Bluetooth.
4744198	4749219	It's going to cost $109.99 and will ship on May 26, 2024.
4749219	4751980	Not gonna lie, I still kind of want one.
4751980	4753340	I still kind of want one.
4753340	4756281	Like, maybe I can have it downstairs with the Xbox.
4758050	4758690	There's a thought.
4758690	4760631	There's a thought.
4760631	4761011	All right.
4761011	4762312	Just just what I need to be doing.
4762312	4764652	Justifying stupid purchases right now.
4764652	4765473	All right.
4765473	4771015	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out games that are coming out real soon, if anything.
4771015	4773315	I don't know if there's... Not a lot.
4773315	4775756	We're in the slow time of the year.
4775756	4785160	So we have a couple of things coming up this week, starting with Freedom Planet 2 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
4785160	4785760	The Gap.
4787203	4787643	on YouTube.
4810400	4812182	No, it apparently is.
4812182	4814685	It's not that.
4814685	4820491	And then we have Biomorph on PC.
4820491	4820992	That is it.
4822617	4825499	All right, going to Japan and checking out the releases there.
4825499	4830603	On the Switch this week, we have on April the 4th, Expeditions, a Mudrunner game.
4830603	4832824	That is the only release coming out in Japan this week.
4832824	4834445	And what is a Mudrunner?
4834445	4839629	It's one of those like, you know, power truck things that goes through the mud, you know, kicks dirt everywhere.
4839629	4841330	Hell yeah, dirt rally.
4841330	4843011	It's one of those type of games.
4843011	4846553	But that is the only release on the Switch this week.
4846553	4850076	On the PlayStation 5, you could also check out Expeditions, a Mudrunner game.
4850436	4851017	Yeah, there's nothing.
4851017	4851457	Nothing at all.
4880236	4881357	Nothing at all.
4881357	4881957	All right.
4881957	4882977	Did the music play with it?
4882977	4886840	Hey, this week, you can maybe catch up on your fucking backlog.
4886840	4887480	There you go.
4887480	4889021	How about that?
4889021	4890642	I'm too busy playing other games.
4890642	4891482	Sorry.
4891482	4891882	That's it.
4891882	4892723	Catching up on your backlog.
4892723	4897565	I'm still in the committed relationship with the ending credits of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.
4897565	4903308	I still have to start Final Fantasy VII Rebirth because I keep getting distracted by shiny things.
4903308	4904709	The eternal struggle.
4904709	4907951	One of these days I'll play the Mario RPG remake that I bought too and never played.
4908789	4910576	All right, moving on.
4910576	4914633	Hey, speaking of games and people's backlog, Loki, I think you have one more story for us.
4915717	4931224	Yeah, it's in my backlog because I don't own a PlayStation 5, but apparently there's still talk saying that even though, you know, we know that Final Fantasy 16 is coming to PC, that might not be the end of it.
4931224	4939808	And according to Yoshida, basically said it's not over in the sense that we have the PC version.
4939808	4944510	Once the PC version is released, we're thinking about hopefully moving to other platforms as well.
4946445	4949687	Wonder what other platforms that could be.
4949687	4952128	I think it's time for the Ouija of the Shine.
4952128	4957332	Everybody's saying Xbox, but I really think it's Nintendo's Switch successor.
4957332	4960794	I feel like Nintendo's Switch successor will see the game before Xbox does.
4960794	4961354	But we'll see.
4961354	4962315	Anything's possible.
4962315	4965196	It's not that like Microsoft and Final Fantasy don't get along.
4965196	4969959	In fact, there's a lot of people on Microsoft's platform that wishes they would put out more Final Fantasy games.
4969959	4972401	You know, the Pixel remasters never came out on Xbox.
4972881	4977963	and that has a lot of people heated because there's no reason there that should there's no reason that should be the case.
4977963	4980303	Those pixel remasters are on fucking phones.
4980303	4983044	They're on phones, Steam, PlayStation.
4983044	4984465	They're not on Xbox.
4984465	4985185	Why?
4985185	4986165	Anybody's guess.
4986165	4986945	It's silly.
4986945	4987225	Yeah.
4987225	4989126	So it almost makes you wonder like this.
4989126	4993808	And then all these fucking hoops with Final Fantasy 14, including what we talked about at the top of the show.
4993808	4998369	It makes people go like, seriously, does Microsoft have a fucking problem with Final Fantasy or something?
4998931	5000332	And they don't.
5000332	5004354	It's just Sony's probably paid the money to be exclusive.
5004354	5005534	And so that's why.
5005534	5006014	Yes.
5006014	5012858	But, you know, I'm not sure how much more Final Fantasy 16 copies are going to sell after this new DLC comes out pretty soon.
5012858	5014338	So.
5014338	5019861	See, I guess there'll still be like a game of the year edition that has it all bundled up in one, but.
5019861	5021642	After that, I don't know.
5021642	5021882	Mm hmm.
5022523	5024746	All right, well, that is all the slotted news we had tonight.
5024746	5031234	You know, it was a little, we had some big stories, but it was a little bit of a slower week just because of, you know, everything that's going on.
5031234	5036841	And I think with the end of the fiscal quarter, spring break, et cetera, et cetera, and all of that.
5036841	5039104	Y'all are still talking about Waffle House and Chad?
5040390	5042411	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5059383	5062526	like Tucson, Arizona, which I've actually been to it's right by the airport.
5062526	5069813	Maybe one of the suburbs of Phoenix might technically be closer in miles, but that's about the closest waffle because I don't think there's any of them on the West.
5069813	5072015	I don't think they're in Oregon, Washington.
5072015	5073357	I don't think they're in Nevada either.
5073357	5077781	And I don't think I've seen any in Idaho when I went up there and drove to there.
5077781	5082485	So I feel like they're not really on the West Coast at all except for Arizona.
5082485	5083987	So anyway,
5085876	5094187	I only eat Waffle House when I go to Dragon Con and even then I'm like, like it was fun the first couple times but even now I'm like, okay, I'm, I'm over it.
5094187	5096089	Like it's, it's a meme at this point.
5096089	5097591	Yeah, I don't, I don't need to go.
5097591	5099674	There's much, much better places I'd rather go.
5102714	5106858	Well, I want to open it up to potentially your calls over on our discord server.
5106858	5110481	vognetwork.com slash discord is the place to give us a call.
5110481	5116247	Or if you have random questions in our chat, we'll always take those over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
5116247	5119470	I will punt it over to Loki to check in and see if we have any last minute stories.
5120880	5148512	uh there's just a rumor that 2k is going to announce their fifa game coming tuesday or they're gonna announce it on tuesday it's supposed to be called fifa 2k fc so we'll see we'll see that actually happens we'll see what happens um one small piece of news i know that came up this week because i follow this game is no man's sky you know how i was bitching about the expedition is ending too early do they have a new patch coming out or something well guess what
5149252	5151013	A new patch came out this week for No Man's Sky.
5151013	5152834	The answer is yes, it is.
5152834	5157597	And it takes a feature that a lot of people really liked about Starfield.
5157597	5166542	I'm not sure it was intended to take a feature from Starfield, but it's basically the customizing the ships and building your ships rather than usually had to rely on the algorithm to kind of get you a good ship.
5166542	5170884	But now they have a little bit more of a robust ship building system in the game.
5170884	5172445	I haven't played it since they did the patch.
5172445	5174446	That's why I'm speaking a little bit generally.
5174446	5177188	But I do know they also finally made algorithmic
5178048	5187792	updated space stations, which is kind of cool because every space station kind of looks the same, which I did like because you always know, okay, run to the left and you're going to find the bag upgrade.
5187792	5192474	So you know, unless you were in a pirate space station, every space station relatively looked the same.
5192474	5196035	So now those are being procedurally generated a little bit as well, which is kind of cool.
5196035	5200336	It brings a little more uniqueness to each system in the game.
5200336	5200476	So
5201997	5229096	I saw this article out there while I was doing uh I was digging up stuff for tonight's show and somebody wrote an article about why uh why No Man's Sky is better than Starfield at this point with this with this latest patch it says they've basically taken every feature that made Starfield interesting and it's in No Man's Sky which I I don't know I feel I feel bad-ish for Starfield because I don't want to hate on that game but it didn't click for me the way that No Man's Sky does I don't know
5230049	5236871	Anyway, SJ100Matt is asking in our chat, did you see the SpotPass Fan Archive project that's going on?
5236871	5240552	So apparently there is this website you can access on GitHub.
5240552	5246113	So it's a GitHub server called, or sorry, a GitHub site called SpotPass Archive.
5246113	5259017	And apparently what this site is doing is you can actually dump a database from your system to help various network revival services in preserving SpotPass content.
5259017	5259837	That's kind of interesting.
5260296	5269042	including Mario Kart 7 for ghost data, StreetPass, the puzzle pieces and all of that, Pokemon games for events and stuff.
5269042	5271824	I didn't know, New Super Mario Brothers 2, I forgot about that.
5271824	5272965	But yeah, there was all this.
5272965	5277649	So apparently they are collecting 3DS dumps and Wii U dumps.
5277649	5280070	I miss Swapnote, man.
5280070	5280431	Cool.
5280971	5285455	Anyway, um, but yeah, that's a whole thing that's happening on GitHub, which is kind of neat.
5285455	5293221	But you know, yeah, leave it, leave it to the fans, the archivists, these folks that I know Nintendo doesn't like, but guess what?
5293221	5297145	When you pull the plug on your services, this is how people get it to live on.
5297145	5299927	So some people are going to go ahead.
5299927	5300908	There's a will, there's a way.
5300908	5301849	That's right.
5301849	5303270	Some people are pissed.
5303270	5306893	They're never going to collect every puzzle piece in the street pass.
5306893	5308915	And so that's why this happens.
5308915	5309135	Yeah.
5310444	5312145	Anyway, all right.
5312145	5314727	Well, I guess that about wraps up for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
5314727	5320852	I know it was a shorter show tonight, but it is a multitude of holidays here in the States and so forth, and a little bit of a slower news week.
5320852	5325196	But we will be back next week, if you can believe it, episode number 999 of our show.
5325196	5333102	And in two weeks, we hit 1,000 weekly episodes of this show, which is quite a landmark.
5333102	5335604	Thanks to all of you for getting along to the riots.
5335604	5336665	It's wild to think about.
5336665	5337185	It really is.
5338946	5349191	Somebody also said to me today, actually it was Jason, our voiceover guy, sent this to me in a text and he said, did you know today is also the 25th anniversary of The Matrix coming out in theaters?
5349191	5352713	And I'm like, I saw that movie in the theater twice.
5352713	5353913	I'm feeling very old right now.
5353913	5357735	I'm feeling very attacked.
5357735	5358836	But we're cool.
5358836	5359896	We're cooler.
5359896	5360496	No, I know.
5360496	5361397	We're super cool.
5361397	5361637	Anyway.
5362908	5365290	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5376109	5382593	Yeah, I didn't finish, like, all the things, but they did it to where you don't have to do them all to unlock all of the items.
5382593	5385855	You just need to finish the tomes.
5385855	5386616	That's nice.
5386616	5393760	And, yeah, at least, like, go through a few of both sides, you know.
5393760	5395261	But it was fun.
5395261	5398803	Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
5398803	5400524	Fact check all the things.
5400524	5401525	Do it.
5401525	5404527	You're, yeah, you'll be a better person for it.
5405842	5409564	and be critical of what you love.
