1
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:14,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, I complained to myself that it's early 2024 and things are being announced that won't be out until 2025.

2
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:17,258
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, we got announcements of things that won't be out until 2026.

3
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:23,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, I am $225 and a Star Citizen and I'm still waiting on Squadron 42, so who am I to gauge time accurately?

4
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:27,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the record, my last Star Citizen purchase was in 2014 and I will pledge no more.

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,601
[SPEAKER_02]: On this Mario day, it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, coming to you at a different hour, yet the same hour, to tell you about this week's gaming news.

6
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:52,691
[SPEAKER_07]: hello my friends out there on the internet welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is orange lounge radio we are live tonight on march the 10th of 2024 with episode number 995 of our program

8
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:09,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all so much for being here, whether you are listening to us live on this Sunday night, as we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you to the live folks.

10
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:12,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, of course, to those

11
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:18,910
[SPEAKER_07]: that listen to us on the podcast feed throughout the week, including iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is that you find your podcasts.

12
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I will point this out.

13
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:27,676
[SPEAKER_07]: With the latest iOS update, iTunes now put the transcriptions in the podcast app.

14
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:32,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of a fun little thing and something folks have been asking us for for quite some time.

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it used to be something that was done with people listening and they charge a lot of money for it.

16
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:39,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was

17
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:41,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Roberts, DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers

18
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:11,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm unsubscribing from spam in our mailbox.

19
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:28,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always convinced, and maybe this is just tinfoil hat, maybe these are the conspiracy theories I learned from my pod daddy, Travis Donovan, but I am convinced that when you unsubscribe for spam, you're just telling them there's a real person looking here, send more spam on different topics.

20
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:30,222
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a legal thing.

21
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:39,805
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually are now... It's a legal requirement that when you unsubscribe for any service, they have to remove you from their list.

22
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same when someone calls you.

23
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:50,007
[SPEAKER_09]: If you answer the phone and tell them, do not remove me from your list, they have to remove you from theirs and any other list by their company.

24
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:53,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't matter if the spam's coming from offshore.

25
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Just tinfoil hat.

26
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, laws don't matter to the lawless.

27
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,591
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not how it works.

28
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:03,372
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

29
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:04,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck.

30
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck clearing out all the spam.

31
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish you well.

32
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:13,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the criminals, I notice Loki is joining us tonight.

33
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's not a criminal.

34
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:16,641
[SPEAKER_07]: But hi, Loki.

35
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:17,082
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

36
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:18,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a smooth criminal.

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Vs. Blue

38
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:38,676
[SPEAKER_07]: the biggest criminal in the entire industry of both movies and games.

39
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,178
[SPEAKER_07]: This we'll get into later this week.

40
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, uh, unfortunately closed rooster teeth this week.

41
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I not?

42
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course I am referring to the one and only, uh, count Zaslav over it.

43
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:54,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why I'm calling him count Zaslav, but I feel like that just makes him like implied that he's criminal.

44
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and, uh, where are we going to get our, our, our headlight fuel or headlight oil?

45
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:01,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's disappointing.

46
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:02,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's upsetting.

47
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It's infuriating.

48
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:04,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we'll get into that more later.

49
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,136
[SPEAKER_07]: But how are you doing, Loki?

50
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:07,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay.

51
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:08,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired.

52
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:09,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, tired.

53
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:11,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that is it all the daylight savings?

54
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:12,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you?

55
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:12,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you?

56
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you sad to have lost an hour?

57
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, daylight savings time did not stop me from sleeping in until 1130 today.

58
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,721
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.

59
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure.

60
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,442
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like some getting used to that.

61
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:25,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just been a stressful week.

62
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:28,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just as I don't know.

63
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:29,024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.

64
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:33,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a great way to de-stress is to play some video games.

65
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get into some gaming news.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking in chat at some of the comments.

67
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Defton chat says Count Zaslav.

68
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it, but that's also too good for him.

69
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:47,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because you're associating it with Count Chocula, which is, which is a great thing, which I understand, which I understand.

70
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:48,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it is.

71
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I said Zaslav, Hag of the Swamp.

72
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:53,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that Zaslav, Hag of the Swamp is a pretty good one too.

73
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's a good one.

74
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:55,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

75
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:56,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

76
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're saying Count Ducula.

77
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,012
[SPEAKER_07]: the count from Sesame Street fine cheese.

78
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:11,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this gold star comment from quest buster in response to the count from Sesame Street 123 tax breaks.

79
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:16,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, thanks.

80
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:16,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

81
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:30,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we're to a point now where they will remove games off of a service because they just don't want to pay the royalties on that for any sales.

82
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just bad.

83
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and so that they can claim a loss that will certainly be much greater than how do you claim a loss?

84
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:40,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, assuming that that's why they're taking these games offline?

85
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,298
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you claim a loss for a game that came out like

86
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:43,128
[SPEAKER_01]: March 10, 2021

87
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:06,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's absolutely nothing on TV to be watching right now, which is why I'm extra thankful that you all are here joining our program.

88
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, March 10th, I'm sure you've seen this somewhere on social media today.

89
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:14,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You abbreviate that to Mar as March usually is Mar 10.

90
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:16,850
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Mario.

91
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,591
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so it's Mario Day.

92
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:22,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, which it's just Mario Day because it says Mar 10.

93
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:23,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like

94
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:28,898
[SPEAKER_07]: an actual anniversary of any of the games or I think Mario's like May the 4th.

95
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:29,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yes.

96
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a made up holiday like May the 4th.

97
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Revenge of the Sith.

98
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

99
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:40,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, there's there's all these made up holidays and nerd culture.

100
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:46,288
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is I think isn't January 17th another one for Star Trek?

101
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,130
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something I don't I say because you flip it around at 1701.

102
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:57,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a better use for May the 4th instead, or for the 4th, and it's...

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a sticker I have of a ballerina in fourth position with lightsabers.

104
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says, May the fourth be with you.

105
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:08,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwell points out November 7.

106
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:09,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

107
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:09,962
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

108
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:14,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And seven day it's it's first contract first contact day that all the Star Trek nerds celebrate.

109
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:15,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

110
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:16,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's the one.

111
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:25,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, but we're gonna talk about Mario Day because Nintendo actually joining in the festivities this year, which is a little unexpected on a Sunday, right, Loki?

112
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:28,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.

113
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:29,584
[SPEAKER_01]: They make announcements.

114
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:33,470
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we don't usually see press releases on a Sunday or directs and things like that, so it's...

115
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, sure.

116
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a few different announcements regarding that.

117
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:50,167
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some further news regarding the collaboration between Nintendo and Lego with their Mario sets that they've been doing for the last few years.

118
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:59,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're going to be doing a Mario Kart set that's going to be coming out in 2025, or at least they're going to kind of spin it off into that.

119
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So curious to see what that is.

120
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario sets are okay.

121
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:15,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, like I kind of wish they were more just like display pieces versus trying to make this all a game because it just doesn't work very well.

122
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:23,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you might you might get your wish with the Mario Kart set because I'm not sure I can actually turn that into a game that's playable very easy anyway.

123
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:28,862
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already seen the you know, we had the what the AR Mario Kart game with the actual cars.

124
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:29,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Rainbow Road Legos

125
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

126
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:13,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Day announced that, yes, to no shock whatsoever, there is a sequel to the Super Mario Bros.

127
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,542
[SPEAKER_01]: movie coming out in April 2026.

128
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow!

129
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so shocked!

130
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:23,547
[SPEAKER_01]: A new animated movie for their very popular animated movie.

131
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:24,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would have thought?

132
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: How much money did that movie make?

133
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:27,696
[SPEAKER_01]: BOTS

134
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to the sequel.

135
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:47,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they bring in the Koopalings and Bowser Jr.

136
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,105
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be really cool way to go with it.

137
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:59,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume Wario would be a very obvious, you know, I'm sure, you know, and maybe people go, but Bowser and Wario in the same movie?

138
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:04,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, if they can put Penguin and Catwoman in the same movie, they can put Bowser and Wario in the same movie.

139
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, Bowser will be back.

140
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just do Super Mario RPG the movie.

141
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:10,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

142
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:11,229
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

143
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:15,190
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think I think if they truly are trying to create the cinema, you know who won't be in it?

144
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey Kong because Donkey Kong will get his own movie.

145
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:23,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they're truly trying to create this cinematic universe, well, Donkey Kong is on land here pretty soon.

146
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:26,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, yeah, that's what they're building out in Florida.

147
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:26,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think

148
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Japan further along?

149
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:29,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

150
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:35,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the testing about how they're showing the test where the car actually jumps the track?

151
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's this whole optical illusion they build by the real track is underneath and it's not so like the car is like way high up from this underneath rail.

152
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it just looks like it's on the rail right in front of you.

153
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:54,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you do the hopping of the tracks, like it just like it makes your brain think you're actually flying, but it's all

154
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:56,579
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S is hoping for more Daisy

155
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,137
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of things they could do with it.

156
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:23,540
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the real speculation is where they get to go with it.

157
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:33,894
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be interesting to see what additional voice acting they confirm for the movie because you know, all the originals that they locked the originals in for a trilogy.

158
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So however you feel about Chris Pratt, Jack Black,

159
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with Chris Pratt.

160
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,206
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming back for a trilogy.

161
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:43,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, honestly, it didn't take me out of it.

162
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not fine with him as a person.

163
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:53,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure, but, like, I'm talking about, like, as far as the voice acting goes, like... The movie's more than one person, so... That's fine.

164
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

165
00:11:56,211 --> 00:12:00,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, and then Keegan-Michael Key is toad, though, absolutely.

166
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:03,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, the whole, the whole, um, the whole cast

167
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:07,718
[SPEAKER_07]: did a fine job with the Mario movie and I'm sure the sequel will be fine.

168
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:13,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just it's going to be interesting to see who does play Wario or who does play the Koopalings.

169
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:17,748
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, depending on those are the additional cast announcements I'll be very curious about.

170
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:20,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Who does Charles Martinet get to cameo as?

171
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I bet they have him cameo again.

172
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they I think they have to.

173
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:25,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be a great little tradition to keep going.

174
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:27,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be Wario.

175
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they go that far.

176
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:35,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like Wario is a is a prime opportunity to do a stunt casting.

177
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:36,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't know who are like the

178
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:59,600
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to forgive me I finally okay look I'm so behind on Hollywood I finally saw the Barbie movie on the flight to the cruise so I was literally like nine months late to the Barbie movie which was great I loved it it was it was really like I just my favorite part of the entire movie I'm sorry to tangent but I'm also not sorry this is Orange Launch Radio

179
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:09,948
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite part of the entire movie was the very beginning, the Lizzo song that's singing about what's going on, and then after she has that whole moment of like, do you all ever think about death?

180
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:21,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the song plays up again, and the lyrics have all changed in the background, and it's like, it goes, I, insecurity, N, I'm scared.

181
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:22,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what they all say.

182
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,032
[SPEAKER_07]: K, death.

183
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,132
[SPEAKER_07]: She changed the lyrics.

184
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,972
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the funniest thing in the whole movie.

185
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

186
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,494
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture says, I need to watch that.

187
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It has Kuri Gatwa in it.

188
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:41,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he's, he is in it, but he's, I would relegate his role more to a cameo.

189
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:49,499
[SPEAKER_07]: They have so many people in that movie, that a lot of them are relegated to more like cameo status.

190
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but he did fine in it for the minimal part.

191
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, what else?

192
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:57,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

193
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:58,332
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

194
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:01,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a couple of release date announcements.

195
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:14,665
[SPEAKER_01]: So the remasters of Paper Mario, the Thousand Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 will be coming out here in the second quarter.

196
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:22,051
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got Thousand Year Door coming out May 23rd and Luigi's Mansion 2 coming June 27th.

197
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, more remakes or remasters, I guess.

198
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:48,547
[SPEAKER_07]: to like extend a game every month to kind of keep the Switch going, so to speak.

199
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:59,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting, especially with all the talk about a Switch successor and has it been delayed to 2025, I think you're starting to see Nintendo lay down, like they're putting down more bricks

200
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:03,879
[SPEAKER_07]: that are going to go through the holiday this year like one game a month through the holiday.

201
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,741
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think these and there's going to be a lot of re releases and remasters because these are the things they're going to come up with quickly.

202
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:18,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think this is just them laying the road till we do get the switch successor, which apparently is going to be next year.

203
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:18,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Now.

204
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:23,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this just kind of lends itself to that is happening.

205
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:24,806
[SPEAKER_07]: The delay.

206
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:24,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

207
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:33,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had news that finally Nintendo Switch Online has added some more Game Boy games.

208
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,114
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are available actually this week on the 12th.

209
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:40,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be getting Dr. Mario, Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis for the Game Boy.

210
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,681
[SPEAKER_07]: which are all extremely subpar.

211
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:54,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Dr. Mario is fine, but we already have the NES version of that, which you don't really need the Game Boy version with that.

212
00:15:54,104 --> 00:16:02,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure, from a preservation, completionist sort of perspective, okay, great, yay, polite applause.

213
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:06,668
[SPEAKER_07]: But this, otherwise this news is nothing to scream about, to be honest.

214
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

215
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:11,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to see that they're still adding things to the library, I suppose.

216
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:28,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Ssj100 Matt points out the 40th anniversary of Mario Brothers is next year so yeah there's going to be plenty of Mario which you know what if they do release a new Nintendo successor next year

217
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:41,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the rumors are true that a new 3D Mario is going to be the game that is bundled with it, I would be very confident in the Nintendo is going to take advantage of that anniversary.

218
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:56,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, say a new Mario game for the 40th anniversary of Mario and, you know, maybe something to highlight the back catalog as well in a similar way that they've done with Super Mario All Stars, the 3D All Stars that they did.

219
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't I don't know what other like catalog, but maybe maybe just

220
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,670
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

221
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:33,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some Dead by Daylight, and I played Avatar, and that's pretty much it.

222
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:45,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably have played a lot more of Avatar than I probably should have, but it's been a weird week, so I've pretty much stayed limited to that.

223
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:47,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I did catch a little bit of your stream last night at Avatar.

224
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it pretty?

225
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks interesting.

226
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:55,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's uh, yeah, I was more curious like what it would look like visually.

227
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:56,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I was surprised though.

228
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:57,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be honest.

229
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:01,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I you you used to really not be into the first person stuff.

230
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:05,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was kind of surprised that you were playing a first person game, but it is pretty.

231
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:07,356
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I put off starting it.

232
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:11,760
[SPEAKER_09]: But once I did, it's actually a lot smoother than I thought it was gonna be.

233
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's other things to break it up.

234
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:21,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's, like, it gets kind of bad in some of the combat, or, like, in the climbing.

235
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:32,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I sometimes have it riding the Ikran, just because, like, it can bank really weird, or it can dive too fast.

236
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I might misjudge things.

237
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:39,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do, it's not that I, it's perfect, but it hasn't given me bad motion sickness.

238
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:50,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nothing I would want to do VR, but I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

239
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:52,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

240
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games should be fun.

241
00:18:54,612 --> 00:19:09,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and on top of that, I just love how well incorporated the the timing system, because you go through a full cycle of day and night and everything, and how like as it starts getting dusk, you start seeing the faint glow.

242
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:17,659
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go into caves, the bioluminescence of the the plants inside comes up and you can see where you're going.

243
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And at night, it is day glow neon madness.

244
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It is absolutely gorgeous.

245
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:26,636
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels magical.

246
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:29,763
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like certain rooms at Omega Mart.

247
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,979
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really fun.

248
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:42,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, you know, I'm a lore nerd and I like artificial sociology, I guess is how I would say it.

249
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:48,343
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, created languages, created environments, cultures, that type of thing.

250
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:54,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to see if I can understand where they got ideas for certain things from or

251
00:19:55,686 --> 00:20:07,910
[SPEAKER_09]: or Howl, you know, just so for me, it's a lot more mentally stimulating than just run around, shoot thing, run around, gather berry, run around, make arrow.

252
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,451
[SPEAKER_07]: But I love to run around and gather berry.

253
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,771
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I do in MMOs.

254
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do all of that and be cerebral at the same time.

255
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:20,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if my brain is just like, then I can just go around and file my big dinosaur.

256
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,515
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely my brain when I play a lot of MMOs.

257
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:37,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one thing I like, too, is that you can get this skill with your Ikran, where if your stamina starts getting low, you can dive by water and skim like a lake or something, and they'll catch fish.

258
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:38,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And you comment on it.

259
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that yummy?

260
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:40,745
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, something like that.

261
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:45,786
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pet your Ikran until they fall asleep.

262
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just you loving Avatar.

263
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Mishkins in chat says, I'm addicted, in caps, to Avatar.

264
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:51,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just so gorgeous.

265
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get an Abahom vibe from the lore and the language.

266
00:20:56,449 --> 00:21:02,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Michi was funny last night.

267
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:05,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause he's like, all right, I'm going to lurk.

268
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll get spoiled.

269
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:08,235
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 minutes later.

270
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:12,857
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

271
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, I'm over here.

272
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:18,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, I've guessed though, like the twist in the game.

273
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was pretty funny.

274
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:22,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, Ooh, I bet he did something.

275
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:24,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he's like, I did the thing.

276
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:25,064
[SPEAKER_09]: You caught me.

277
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:25,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, told you.

278
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:27,490
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

279
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,991
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

280
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:34,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Questmaster says this is a sandbox fan Frontiers of Pandora is definitely on my list my ever growing list.

281
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a full mood.

282
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Prioritize it.

283
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,579
[SPEAKER_07]: The backlog ever grows.

284
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,580
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

285
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's go over to Techmaster Loki.

286
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what have you prioritized for your gaming week?

287
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:44,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I prioritize

288
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:46,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Editing

289
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:25,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I played that with Peep a bit and so that was fun to get to go up against they have like two factions now there's like robots that kind of like basically the Terminator and then bugs which are basically you know the creatures from Starship Troopers so

290
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:35,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it I gotta ask a ridiculous question because remember I was out of town on break when this whole thing kind of, you know, got really big, so to speak.

291
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Helldiver, what kind of game even is it?

292
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:37,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what is the game?

293
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:38,792
[SPEAKER_07]: The shooty game?

294
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:39,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

295
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a third person shooter.

296
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:44,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, you're going to different locations.

297
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:49,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So you drop down to a map and you have different objectives that you do in there.

298
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,200
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be that

299
00:22:51,801 --> 00:23:15,916
[SPEAKER_01]: your primary objective is to destroy this one thing and so you destroy that thing and you have to get back to your extract point but there's also like other bonus objectives you can do and it scales up in difficulty as you pick harder missions and stuff and essentially you have different like patrols that are going around and you have to defend yourself against you know

300
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:26,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of enemies that are coming and utilize your different drops that you can do to call things down from the sky and stuff like that.

301
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:26,986
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

302
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:29,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Defton chat says third person tactical shooter.

303
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Starship Troopers the game, which quest?

304
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:36,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, essentially, yes, essentially Starship Troopers the game and death says it gets harder.

305
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's okay.

306
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:37,817
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

307
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it does definitely get harder.

308
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:57,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember what that game is I played recently that was it was kind of like that I felt like you were doing like aliens and stuff but it had a very Dark Souls vibe to it but you could play it with friends it was very difficult for me that's why I didn't get very far with it because it was it was very difficult so the sequel just came out not that long ago

309
00:23:58,837 --> 00:23:59,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it, why can't I remember?

310
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing it on Game Pass.

311
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:05,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody, somebody in chat will remember what this is.

312
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:05,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the name.

313
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,999
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called the game Rob can't remember the name of, but he can see it clearly in his mind.

314
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, my lovely memory.

315
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play it very much because I wasn't good at it.

316
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like, my friend was very big on it.

317
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried to get into it, you know, to like have something to play with my friend.

318
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:21,182
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just kept getting like, it was very difficult.

319
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:26,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So but it was it had more of a like Dark Souls vibe to it because you know, a lot of games want to go that direction.

320
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:26,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So

321
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:34,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is very much, like, very much heavily inspired by Starship Troopers, like immensely.

322
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:41,249
[SPEAKER_01]: And just even the the presentation of it is very much Starship Troopers.

323
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:43,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Remnant, that's the game, Remnant.

324
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Remnant?

325
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

326
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:47,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very, very over the top.

327
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:50,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also only a $40 game, which is kind of nice.

328
00:24:50,473 --> 00:25:00,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is still early in its development and they're adding like more stuff to it as time goes on.

329
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:06,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, there's different things that unlock, like they just unlocked these like mech suits that you can get now.

330
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:11,443
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a contingent on liberating like a certain amount of the plants and stuff.

331
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you play the game, you're also

332
00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:26,409
[SPEAKER_01]: working with all the other players to try to, you know, basically wipe out the resistance of either the automatons or the insects on these planets.

333
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get stuff for that.

334
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds interesting.

335
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to check that out at some point.

336
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be all the rage right now.

337
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:34,832
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cool.

338
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:38,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, yeah, definitely check out the like even this the intro video.

339
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:40,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely Starship Troopers.

340
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:45,996
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm doing my part.

341
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,979
[SPEAKER_07]: That gif is why I remember from that.

342
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:48,780
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

343
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a lot I remember from that.

344
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,924
[SPEAKER_07]: But specifically, there's that.

345
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:56,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see other my game a week.

346
00:25:56,629 --> 00:25:58,631
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the same stuff I've been playing.

347
00:25:58,631 --> 00:25:59,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot new.

348
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:00,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm catching up on on these.

349
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:03,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Seasonal type of things.

350
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So like Diablo 4, I've been really going hard on this latest season.

351
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:09,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's growing on me, but not the season.

352
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:12,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I still don't don't like the season mechanic, but I do.

353
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:20,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like the little pet that you get, the little construct and like how changing their abilities can kind of change what you're doing.

354
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:28,027
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I can't stand how much is based around the the trap layers or whatever they call the vaults.

355
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:30,991
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

356
00:26:44,871 --> 00:27:12,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Battle Pass tier 35 or something and I'm level 50 no I'm level 60 now level 61 or something like that so I've been been playing that quite a bit still playing Final Fantasy 14 as well eagerly awaiting the Dawn Trail expansion trying to get all of my characters to 90 in their respective classes my Black Mage is 88 and my Dark Knight is 89 so I have like two classes very very close to being level 90 that I can add to the list and I think I only have like four more after that so

357
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:16,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out Diablo 4 is coming to Game Pass this month.

358
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

359
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:23,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll be nice to kind of have that infusion of players into the mix.

360
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:28,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Because here's the thing, and I realize not everybody is into the end game stuff in Diablo, and that's fine.

361
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:36,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do think the Diablo base experience, the base game, with the whole main story with Lilith, is absolutely worth playing.

362
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, whether you want to keep going from there, I think that just depends on what you like as a gamer.

363
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:42,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

364
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:53,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that, Final Fantasy XIV.

365
00:27:53,167 --> 00:28:06,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other one that I've been playing is a game I've talked a lot about, No Man's Sky, but what makes it different this time is that there is the twelfth expedition that started in the game before I went on the cruise, and I think I have seven days left to finish it.

366
00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:12,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm through the first two parts of five, so I did a stream of that game, I think, on Monday.

367
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:17,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yeah, so I don't have a whole lot of time left to finish, but I'm gonna hope I can get a little more done.

368
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:41,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say I did not find the expedition so far anyway to be super challenging and it's been a really good way to kind of get the leg up like what it walks you through is it's build a very nice base and I'm going to give you a ton of base parts to help you do it and you know jump to an atlas thing jump to and all these things you have to do is a core part of the story this expedition has felt very much like a jump start to the game

369
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:44,606
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

370
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:21,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they're trying to create a scarcity thing, which I think is silly, unless they have something planned, usually based on track record, they don't, it'll go five weeks, the expedition will end and then we'll have a drive for five weeks until the next patch, which hey, we're lucky the game is getting this support six, seven years after its release as it is.

371
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:29,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not really a complaint, but just just let the expeditions last as long as you know, they need to not everybody can just like rush in there and play them.

372
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:30,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all.

373
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:33,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see if I beat it or not.

374
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to stream all of my progress, but I just don't think that's going to be possible.

375
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:41,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I might do some tonight.

376
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,147
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

377
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of depends what's going on.

378
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it for my gaming week.

379
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:53,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So usually I would tell you guys about any upcoming shows off or things to note.

380
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:59,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the only thing I would note is that tonight is episode number 995 of our show.

381
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:07,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look at a calendar, that means episode number 1000 of this program will be April 14.

382
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So for those that are taking notes, episode 1000, the first weekly gaming podcast to hit 1000 episodes.

383
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:20,234
[SPEAKER_07]: April 14 and very right before my birthday.

384
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:20,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Very excited.

385
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:24,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what a birthday gift coming up.

386
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:26,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we're just excited about it.

387
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:29,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't don't expect a lot of stunts.

388
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, after we've been doing this for 22 years, we're a little bit stunted out.

389
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would love to have some old faces come back and visit us on the show.

390
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:40,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have some we have some cute things planned.

391
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:42,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So but don't set the bar too high.

392
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:52,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be another week in gaming news that we talk about in the patentedly way that we do every week.

393
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:54,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's that.

394
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Def says episode 1000 will be April 14.

395
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Knocks on wood.

396
00:30:58,045 --> 00:30:59,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it will be April 14.

397
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:06,687
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have to miss a show, we're going to make up the show midweek because DarkSakura is going to be out the next week for her birthday trip.

398
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:07,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going.

399
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:09,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, doing my birthday thing.

400
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has to be April 14.

401
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:11,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So

402
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,267
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that.

403
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:15,029
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

404
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:17,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, Bobby Blackwell says getting the ladder out to set the bar.

405
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:18,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

406
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

407
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,055
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

408
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:22,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some gaming news.

409
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:26,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're gonna start off tonight with a follow up, something we were talking about last week, Loki.

410
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:39,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for the pre-Mario Day festivities earlier in the week, of course, Nintendo filing lawsuit against the Yuzu emulator.

411
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:53,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And as kind of what I figured would happen, a company with a large amount of money bullying a smaller company with a lawsuit, of course, they're going to settle and, you know, take the...

412
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:53,806
[SPEAKER_07]: and

413
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:26,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's stupid, but I don't think the intent of the software was to pirate games, but there are some people that would use it for that.

414
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:37,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but anyways, but you realize it's hard to deny and disavow that when that talk is happening in your official discord that is paywalled behind a Patreon to get to

415
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:41,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the optics really not good.

416
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they brought in a lawyer, then they settled.

417
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:49,685
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that lawyer said you equals fucked settle.

418
00:32:52,530 --> 00:33:00,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so Traffic Haze, the company behind Yuzu, has agreed to pay $2.4 million to Nintendo.

419
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:10,839
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to cease offering Yuzu, and they also had the handover of yuzu-emu.org to Nintendo.

420
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:17,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with that, they've also taken down Citra and the 3DS simulator as well.

421
00:33:17,282 --> 00:33:18,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, what's the name of the website?

422
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see what message Nintendo put on it.

423
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:20,684
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it called?

424
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:50,553
[SPEAKER_07]: uh it's yuzu-emu or emu.org oops of course i mistyped it okay i just want to see if nintendo oh no it just says it's their goodbye letter is all this up there right now yeah um i'm glad i downloaded it for preservation purposes when the lawsuit happened everybody was like get get get get it now before it's well it was open source right

425
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:53,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so there's Yuzu out there.

426
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clones.

427
00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:57,346
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, deviations all over now at this point.

428
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:02,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so yeah, so they've taken that down.

429
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:06,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some other emulators also considering taking themselves down as well.

430
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:20,688
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Game Boy Advance Game Boy Color one that was unrelated, but they were looking at taking it down because of what happened here, which at least this didn't go to court and set a precedent for emulators because emulators are legal.

431
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:22,529
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, obviously,

432
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:29,112
[SPEAKER_01]: If they didn't have like the discussion within their own discord about piracy...

433
00:34:30,421 --> 00:34:32,462
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps they would have had a little bit of a chance.

434
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:41,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think though necessarily that may have been the case because I think Nintendo would have dragged it out long enough to milk them until they essentially were bankrupt and then they'd have to settle.

435
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:56,580
[SPEAKER_07]: If you really read into like what Nintendo says, they choose their words very carefully when they're responding to this because they're trying to make it sound like emulators are bad and lead to piracy and all this stuff even though we all know that's not true.

436
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,589
[SPEAKER_01]: They also made him like put out a statement basically saying that, oh yeah, Yuzu is for piracy.

437
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:03,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah.

438
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, DarkSakura in chat says, Yeah, I thought we settled that in Bleem versus Sony, which I know is a topic that came up on Bobby's show tonight.

439
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:24,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I mean, like, and again, I think the excellent point that was brought up is that Nintendo uses their own emulator, like Nintendo runs emulators to make, you know, perhaps it's different when it's, you know, things that they own, but at face value, piracy.

440
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:30,059
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Nintendo also does emulators for things that are Sega and other things, but they have

441
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,020
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

442
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:51,988
[SPEAKER_07]: for the fact that your emulator is, you know, homebrew open.

443
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:57,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's there's plenty of developers out there that will, especially especially for the classic stuff, right?

444
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:04,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you look at like the main emulator and there's lots of old ass arcade games that people have made public domain at this point.

445
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:14,960
[SPEAKER_07]: They have released the code and these the public domain so that emulators can sufficiently test themselves and so forth and, you know, bring light to these games that for the most part did not get a lot of light back in the day.

446
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

447
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,680
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

448
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:48,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to have that line in the sand though between the homebrew and the legitimate purposes of an emulator, what they're for, and you can't have talk on your official Discord about here's how to find the latest ROM of a game that's not out yet.

449
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have to police that a little bit if you're going to run a community like that.

450
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's I think the lesson to learn here.

451
00:36:54,281 --> 00:37:01,704
[SPEAKER_07]: So I I'm sad though, to see the other emulator developers kind of getting out and going like nope, noping out basically, I understand.

452
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:06,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sympathetic toward it because I'm not I'm not going to sit here and be like, No, you need to stay and fight the good fight.

453
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:07,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

454
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Like these lawsuits and the million dollar stuff.

455
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,027
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very scary stuff.

456
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:13,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially some of the things that Nintendo is saying.

457
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So I get it.

458
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,649
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, you just

459
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:24,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody that's working in this just has to make sure they're in the clear because if Nintendo finds an opportunity, they're going to go for it.

460
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:27,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And that goes with almost anybody.

461
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:38,437
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at this point, I don't think Sega gives a damn about their old hardware and things like that, you know, but you know, Nintendo, especially for a current, you know, system is going to take issue with this.

462
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:38,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

463
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:48,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Questbuster also brings up a very good point saying settling with Nintendo also avoided whatever discovery their legal team would have to do.

464
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:53,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows what else Nintendo would have found on how Yuzu conducted their business.

465
00:37:53,235 --> 00:38:00,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe there could have been things that were obtained in a not so great way.

466
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:16,047
[SPEAKER_07]: other unreleased roms may I mean you you invent your own scenario here because that's all it is is speculation and maybe that's something the yuzu folks wanted to avoid as well which is why they they caved as quick as they did essentially

467
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:21,669
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

468
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,910
[SPEAKER_07]: S200mat in chat says emulation is key for game preservation.

469
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We can all agree on that.

470
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:48,436
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it gets into piracy of new unreleased games, you kind of don't have much of a leg to stand on.

471
00:38:48,436 --> 00:38:50,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That's succinctly it.

472
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:52,861
[SPEAKER_07]: That is succinctly it in one sentence.

473
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:54,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right, two sentences.

474
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:55,223
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

475
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:56,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

476
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,139
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

477
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:38,973
[SPEAKER_01]: like justify like is that actually the piracy of the actual movie?

478
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:40,834
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't agree that it is.

479
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:49,481
[SPEAKER_07]: If that video company has a back room where they're running duplications of said found film, then that's yes, that's a problem.

480
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happened here.

481
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:52,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it.

482
00:39:52,484 --> 00:39:53,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's the same.

483
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,866
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I understand.

484
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:58,529
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I think it's a stretch.

485
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,810
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't you can't.

486
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:18,803
[SPEAKER_07]: let them have an opportunity and that's what they did is they created these very bad optics you're gonna pay on patreon to get in this discord where we're gonna talk about running a game on the emulator that isn't even out yet this is this bad optics anyway you slice it and that's what allowed nintendo to come in and shut it down

487
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo didn't shut it down because it was an emulator.

488
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:31,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo shut it down because they had that, we believe, over a million copies of Twilight, which, you know, one could argue if that figure was accurate or not.

489
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:37,351
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's all about optics and making a jury believe you.

490
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:37,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

491
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:40,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go from one hot button issue to another.

492
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to talk about AI?

493
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

494
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

495
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:46,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

496
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:53,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, like, at face value, I think a lot of people make opinions on this, but I'm not sure, I mean, I don't know.

497
00:40:53,008 --> 00:40:58,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody can explain it to me if it's worse than I think it is, because I actually think this isn't bad at all.

498
00:40:58,653 --> 00:41:00,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is wild, because I'm about to talk about EA.

499
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:07,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So EA is talking about using generative AI to make development more efficient.

500
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:16,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is from the CEO, Andrew Wilson, who spoke at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference and talked about some things which were live streamed.

501
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:24,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was talking about how this era of generative AI is incredibly exciting and that they are embracing deeply the new technology.

502
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:35,398
[SPEAKER_07]: He's talking about also how he thinks about using AI in three kind of pillars or three categories, efficiency, expansion, and transformation.

503
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:44,121
[SPEAKER_07]: In a direct quote, he said, and now, of course, we're in the era of generative AI, which is the most exciting yet by a fairly wide margin, and something that we're embracing deeply.

504
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:47,683
[SPEAKER_07]: We think about this in three core vectors, that's what I just said.

505
00:41:47,683 --> 00:41:51,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So he talks about how it takes a long time to develop a game.

506
00:41:52,783 --> 00:42:04,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently in analyzing the game development cycle, he sees that in some of the processes, about 60% have high feasibility to be positively impacted by generative AI.

507
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:08,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Brings up the example of building a stadium in a sports game.

508
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, it used to take six months in the past.

509
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:16,354
[SPEAKER_07]: In the past year, it took six weeks, and soon it will take six days.

510
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:27,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And while we don't have the math of it yet, I would tell you in the back of my mind, my orientation is, how can we use generative AI to make us 30% more efficient as a company?

511
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,093
[SPEAKER_07]: How in three years from today could we be 30% more efficient?

512
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:44,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would tell you part of that is how do we get our people to embrace it?

513
00:42:44,215 --> 00:42:46,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And for creators of games, this is incredibly exciting.

514
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:51,580
[SPEAKER_07]: The ability to get to the fun faster and get to market faster is the holy grail for them.

515
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:58,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we see a real embrace happening inside of our company and around these things that can help them get to greatness much more quickly.

516
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:05,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Generative AI impacts monetization on other platforms

517
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:21,715
[SPEAKER_07]: That's already happening too.

518
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:27,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're right, exactly curated to show you the content you want to see, like that's, yeah.

519
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:36,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not necessarily certain like how they're, I think that they're using the phrase generative AI in not necessarily the right way.

520
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:43,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, that one of the examples they give is that Andrew Wilson is talking about AI can expand the experience for gamers.

521
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:48,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying, for example, FIFA 23 had 12 run cycles for the players.

522
00:43:49,095 --> 00:43:56,162
[SPEAKER_01]: EA Sports FC 24 had 1200 all done with generative AI.

523
00:43:56,162 --> 00:44:02,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's almost like, you can have like physics based animation and stuff like that.

524
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:14,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they're considering that AI as well, or if they're like saying, okay, hey, here are, you know, I mean, they could be just doing like keyframing and having AI generate the inbetweens or something like that, which is

525
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweening

526
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:27,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, admittedly, I need to know more about what's going on here.

527
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:44,504
[SPEAKER_07]: But in looking at the context about the stadium and all that stuff, and especially if the generative AI is being trained off of EA's own work in EA's own system, you know, AI is I'm not as opposed to what's going on with AI when we talk about again, it's a tool in allowing things to become more efficient.

528
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:46,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think when we talk about graphics, getting

529
00:44:46,886 --> 00:44:50,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Even greater pixels, 8K and things like that, more frames a second.

530
00:44:50,548 --> 00:44:56,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to some extent, AI is going to have to be a part of having that happen in a reasonable amount of time, right?

531
00:44:56,851 --> 00:45:04,114
[SPEAKER_07]: But when that replaces, so when AI facilitates art making, I'm a little more okay with it.

532
00:45:04,114 --> 00:45:06,995
[SPEAKER_07]: When AI replaces the art making, I'm not okay with it.

533
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,216
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem.

534
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:17,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just more concerned because their games are kind of jank already or pretty jank just with, you know, the how quickly they turn them around each year.

535
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:26,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that they're trying to be more efficient, mainly just so that they could please their shareholders even more because infinite money and infinite growth.

536
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:32,299
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just don't see them utilizing this in a positive way.

537
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:40,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is just going to make their already janky games more jank and predatory monetization even more so.

538
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.

539
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:43,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't trust Andrew Wilson.

540
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:49,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep having this mental image of the scene.

541
00:45:49,388 --> 00:45:53,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember the old Santa Claus movie from the 80s that had?

542
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:56,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, John Lithgow.

543
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:56,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?

544
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:57,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm trying to remember.

545
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:58,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Dudley Moore.

546
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it had John Lithgow and Dudley Moore.

547
00:46:01,664 --> 00:46:18,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And how, like, his stuff was like, we'll automate everything and then they decided to do an automated, you know, Christmas and everything was falling apart and shitty because it was made with programmed machines that would eventually, you know,

548
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:22,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of the mental image I have right now.

549
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:29,312
[SPEAKER_07]: You get what you pay for, and when you cut corners and stuff, you know, especially the way things are right now, people can tell.

550
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:33,354
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the, you know, the AI art with multiple fingers.

551
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:33,734
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

552
00:46:33,734 --> 00:46:39,656
[SPEAKER_07]: The Foamstar Games got a lot of shit for using AI in its soundtrack cover art, because everybody says it looks like garbage.

553
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:44,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like uninspired AI art is what it looks like.

554
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:47,540
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so I think, you know, there's always something wrong.

555
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:47,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

556
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, when you take the heart out of it, there's there's that.

557
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let's see.

558
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:58,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifth Dream in chat says two words procedural generation.

559
00:46:58,323 --> 00:47:04,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine Elder Scrolls six with a world the actual size of Earth, you know, that shit would be crunch time if people had to plop down every tree.

560
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and you know, Starfield.

561
00:47:07,906 --> 00:47:11,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and No Man's Sky, which is fine, which is a game I really like.

562
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:13,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, one better than the other.

563
00:47:13,948 --> 00:47:25,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Something different to when when what the the source the machine has to go off of is created by a limited group.

564
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:27,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes sense.

565
00:47:27,392 --> 00:47:31,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of using assets, you know, just from Lord knows where.

566
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer, like, the games not to be bigger.

567
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they necessarily need to be bigger.

568
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:40,253
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need to be as packed as Skyrim was.

569
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:47,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that was a game that was of adequate size, and with that, like, the world being big doesn't mean that it's big and empty.

570
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:49,740
[SPEAKER_01]: It was big and full of things to do.

571
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,583
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where, like, with Starfield... Yeah, like Avatar.

572
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:58,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, with Starfield, like, they're like, we're making it even bigger and all these planets and stuff.

573
00:47:58,186 --> 00:48:01,447
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, but you didn't make content for all of those planets.

574
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:06,830
[SPEAKER_01]: You procedurally generate like these same structures on all of those planets.

575
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It's boring because it's just the same garbage over and over again.

576
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:13,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas at least No Man's Sky, everything's procedurally generated.

577
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:18,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are actual like distinct things with each one of those planets.

578
00:48:18,136 --> 00:48:20,017
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure, it starts to get a little bit samey, but

579
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:20,818
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

580
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:56,502
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, every tree and every flower and those sorts of things being where they need to be where I'm not okay with AI is when we talk about generating the quest text and that type of thing on about generating the story filling in for the storytelling part of the game.

581
00:48:56,502 --> 00:48:58,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's where it crosses the line for me.

582
00:48:58,883 --> 00:48:59,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's not art.

583
00:48:59,943 --> 00:49:00,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

584
00:49:00,863 --> 00:49:08,306
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know, I think we just kind of have to find again that right a balance where AI is a tool to the art and not a replacement to the art.

585
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:09,887
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is.

586
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,109
[SPEAKER_07]: AI as a tool for art is fine.

587
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:14,372
[SPEAKER_07]: AI as a replacement for art is not fine.

588
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:15,693
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I view it.

589
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:21,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from EA though, just like with how they treat their games already and how it's just like it literally is.

590
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:29,838
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hey, we're removing features and we'll add them back a couple years later and pretend it's brand new and stuff and call it innovation.

591
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:36,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they haven't innovated in any of those sports games in years.

592
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:40,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like the fact that they're like, yeah, we're going to automate this even more.

593
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:40,526
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like.

594
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be a good thing.

595
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:45,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, it can't be.

596
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:50,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bobby does present this perspective, which was a little out of mind for me.

597
00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:56,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like it's happening everywhere in the industry, but saying EA laid off 670 people last week.

598
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are people that did things that generative AI could do instead.

599
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:07,102
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're seeing this, this, this is not just EA, it's the entire industry has been losing people for, you know, various reasons.

600
00:50:07,102 --> 00:50:11,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And some, you know, could point at AI.

601
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:22,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I pointed a lot of bad business decisions when it comes to doubling down on battle passes, not to get too far ahead of ourselves, and things of that nature and people making games that people don't want to play.

602
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:28,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And I again, I feel like if the industry leans into the AI thing too hard,

603
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:33,182
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to see right through it.

604
00:50:33,182 --> 00:50:38,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of business people at the top that really underestimate the gaming public.

605
00:50:38,447 --> 00:50:40,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Suicide Squad is a great example of that.

606
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:48,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I think WB thought that game would sell on IP alone, and they severely underestimated how much gamers talk to each other and will share the very, very bad news.

607
00:50:49,517 --> 00:51:13,306
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and that's the thing too like with games like that where they are even like trying to command a higher price tag already and then it's just like fundamentally broken and all that stuff and there's a lot of buzzwords that they try to throw around the industry to try to get people hyped up about different things you may remember and because it hasn't been mentioned in a while that cloud gaming was this huge thing not necessarily saying that you know

608
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:16,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Cloud Gaming and the fact that, you know, we have game streaming stuff.

609
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:20,309
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm talking about like cloud gaming to make games more powerful.

610
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:26,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Crackdown 3, how it's supposed to utilize the Azure cloud servers and be a fully destructible environment.

611
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:28,114
[SPEAKER_07]: SimCity reboot.

612
00:51:28,114 --> 00:51:29,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that dumpster fire?

613
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:32,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

614
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:36,158
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well, that that's multiple.

615
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:46,333
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that the forced online only thing with that which which is unnecessary for I guess DRM or something, whatever it may be.

616
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did games like that flop?

617
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:52,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know so much about Crackdown 3, but SimCity in particular gamers fucking talk good.

618
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:53,415
[SPEAKER_07]: They talk a lot.

619
00:51:55,302 --> 00:51:58,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they promised all this stuff and none of it was there.

620
00:51:58,503 --> 00:52:00,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with like Suicide Squad.

621
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:08,586
[SPEAKER_01]: They promised like, I mean, you have a pedigree of this company that's made all these Batman Arkham games were just fantastic.

622
00:52:08,586 --> 00:52:11,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And they spent a very long time on this game.

623
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:14,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's awful.

624
00:52:14,227 --> 00:52:18,629
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bad in like every sense of the word.

625
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:22,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's not even done.

626
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just,

627
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:33,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And they think they can also play off the success of the, you know, just of the Arkham universe alone, too.

628
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:33,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

629
00:52:33,634 --> 00:52:38,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they trashed the Arkham universe, just like even the way they killed off Batman in it.

630
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:39,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, really?

631
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:41,678
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is how you're going to, you know...

632
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:51,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Tribulize this character, you're just gonna basically say, oh, hey, you know, he was super cool in all these games and we're just gonna kill him off like a punk here.

633
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:54,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, like, thanks.

634
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:54,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

635
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like very disrespectful to the fans.

636
00:52:57,488 --> 00:53:01,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even once I learned the premise of the story, I was like, yeah, I'm not into this.

637
00:53:01,051 --> 00:53:05,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't like DC anyway, but this is just like even more reason not to play it.

638
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like Crackdown.

639
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:14,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even though the last one kind of sucked, I would play this game just because of like the Crackdown-ness of it.

640
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,687
[SPEAKER_01]: But then after seeing all the reviews and how like, it's just literally every mission is the same.

641
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:20,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm good.

642
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:21,811
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I don't need to play this.

643
00:53:23,352 --> 00:53:35,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we go to our next story, I have to bring this up at some point during the show because if we're going to talk about these CEOs and people that make way too much money in this industry to make some bad fucking decisions, I think some of you know where I'm going with this.

644
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:37,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard the latest thing?

645
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course, the whole like, we're going to ban TikTok thing is coming back all of a sudden.

646
00:53:42,744 --> 00:53:46,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, it looks like it might actually happen.

647
00:53:46,826 --> 00:53:47,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they might actually

648
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:54,410
[SPEAKER_07]: and TikTok or I guess have it delisted from stores or whatever if the company fails to divest.

649
00:53:54,410 --> 00:54:03,814
[SPEAKER_07]: There is now a group spearheaded by, wait for it, Bobby Kotick looking to buy TikTok.

650
00:54:03,814 --> 00:54:11,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So for all those, for everybody that was wondering, what will that man shit on next now that he's out of the gaming industry?

651
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:12,858
[SPEAKER_07]: You have your answer.

652
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:13,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

653
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:15,459
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to get into social media.

654
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:30,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean like I'm on TikTok lately I use I guarantee if Bobby Kotick buys that uninstall done not going back like if that if that's if I have a feeling he's not gonna be able to yeah

655
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:35,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Fifth Dream says good timing since ours are about to ban it.

656
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:39,671
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, this is a problem on both sides because Biden said he'll sign it.

657
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:40,932
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a problem on both sides.

658
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:43,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's essentially that they're saying that they have to dive.

659
00:54:43,974 --> 00:54:51,000
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily have to go to Bobby Kotick, but it's essentially that they have to divest from their Chinese business partners.

660
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially they have to sell to like a U.S.

661
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,905
[SPEAKER_01]: company or I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be a U.S.

662
00:54:56,905 --> 00:54:57,125
[SPEAKER_01]: company.

663
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:57,626
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be like

664
00:54:58,266 --> 00:55:02,695
[SPEAKER_01]: a European company, a different company that's not in China, essentially.

665
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:04,679
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Bobby Kotick, ew.

666
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you really want to kill the platform, there you go.

667
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:20,992
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the stupidest thing for Biden to do in an election year because there are going to be so many people that are going to associate.

668
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:27,756
[SPEAKER_07]: If TikTok gets pulled away, there are going to be so many younger voters, which otherwise would probably be a little bit incentivized to vote.

669
00:55:28,376 --> 00:55:31,958
[SPEAKER_07]: for him that are going to say, you know what, I'm just going to stay home or I'm not going to vote.

670
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to do it because he shut down TikTok.

671
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,540
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a stupid, stupid thing for him to be doing in an election year.

672
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to say it.

673
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:45,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And I fully support him and plan on voting for him, especially to prevent the alternative.

674
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:46,804
[SPEAKER_07]: God help us all.

675
00:55:46,804 --> 00:55:53,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why I wince and I grimace when I see him making really bad decisions.

676
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:57,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blacko says I'm okay with-

677
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:30,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Insensitive of age, but I think that we need a president that is young enough to be able to connect to a younger voting base and not too old to be stuck in how things used to be done, but still be old enough to have wisdom to know what to do with it.

678
00:56:31,544 --> 00:56:32,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sense?

679
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:33,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

680
00:56:33,786 --> 00:56:39,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma in chat says, the fact that government-managed phones have TikTok blocked, the app is a security hazard.

681
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:42,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby in chat says, I'm okay with government-managed phones having app restrictions.

682
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:49,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm fine with that, too, because, yeah, again, work phones should have work things on it, and TikTok's not a work thing.

683
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:50,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Separate issue, right?

684
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:53,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we all agree that's a separate issue.

685
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:57,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, work phones can have work apps, and whatever can dictate what work apps look like.

686
00:56:57,562 --> 00:56:59,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Separate issue.

687
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:00,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifth Dream in chat says,

688
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,025
[SPEAKER_07]: People who use TikTok aren't old enough to vote.

689
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:03,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Old man take.

690
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:06,366
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an old man take and tells me you're not using TikTok.

691
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:10,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm not trying to be rude, but like... I've been using TikTok for a while.

692
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of people.

693
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:13,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, look at the people posting videos on TikTok.

694
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:18,770
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not children because children can't post videos on TikTok.

695
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't stop them, but they're not supposed to.

696
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,191
[SPEAKER_07]: No, yeah, they're not supposed to.

697
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:24,191
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

698
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, let's move on.

699
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:29,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, some sad news, but I'll turn it over to DarkSakura.

700
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:53,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so, icon, legend, we all... I'm surprised to find people who don't know this name, or have at least heard of it, but Toriyama Akira died because of an acute subdural hematoma, like a brain clot-ish type thing.

701
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And he died on the 1st, and he was in the middle of many, many projects.

702
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:08,286
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it was very, very, very sudden.

703
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:15,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go ahead and read the message from Bird Studio and Capsule Corporation Tokyo.

704
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,071
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to also just try to

705
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z

706
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:47,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like to acknowledge Dragon Ball GT, but yes, it existed in Dragon Ball Supers, which was pretty good.

707
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,608
[SPEAKER_09]: It also did Dr. Slump.

708
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:54,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It did Sand Land, a game.

709
00:58:54,569 --> 00:59:06,111
[SPEAKER_09]: He did the character designs for Chrono Trigger, for Blue Dragon, which was a RPG on Dreamcast, and all of the Dragon Quest series.

710
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:11,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's funny.

711
00:59:11,775 --> 00:59:24,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I couldn't stand watching Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z in English just because of how, like, butchered I would say a lot of the localization was.

712
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess they did the best that they could, but, you know.

713
00:59:29,292 --> 00:59:33,114
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a very emotional thing.

714
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:38,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of had a shutdown right after where I couldn't feel anything for a while.

715
00:59:38,017 --> 00:59:40,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Blue Dragon was Xbox 360.

716
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was thinking of something else.

717
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:50,364
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, I remember being in college, this was like 95, and trading off

718
00:59:54,549 --> 01:00:17,688
[SPEAKER_09]: my 5 VHS tapes of Guyver, like legit ones, for a box of Dragon Ball Z fansubs and the movies fansubbed, and some Sailor Moon and some other stuff raw, and some Ranma 1 half fansubbed by the original fansubbers, the Ranma Project.

719
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,491
[SPEAKER_09]: and a bunch of raw episodes.

720
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:26,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And we sat, and we sat through the entirety.

721
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:30,256
[SPEAKER_09]: We practically had our daily marathon to watch it.

722
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:43,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but anyway, and then Chrono Trigger for me was very special because I'm sure y'all remember that I had been doing a fundraiser for my papa-san while she died during my marathon.

723
01:00:44,664 --> 01:00:59,796
[SPEAKER_09]: and one of her last messages to me on Facebook was telling me that one of her favorite memories of us hanging out was her coming in to watch me play Chrono Trigger.

724
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:10,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear friends and partners, we are deeply saddened to inform you that manga creator Toriyama Akira passed away on March 1st due to acute subdural hematoma.

725
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:12,838
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in age of 68.

726
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:32,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It is our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm.

727
01:01:32,113 --> 01:01:34,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I think this is translated for the record.

728
01:01:34,754 --> 01:01:39,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, he would have many more things to achieve.

729
01:01:39,077 --> 01:01:43,801
[SPEAKER_09]: However, he had left many manga titles and works of art to the world.

730
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:49,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to the support of so many people around the world, he has been able to continue his creative activities for over 45 years.

731
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:58,189
[SPEAKER_09]: We hope that Toriyama's unique world of creation continues to be loved by everyone for a long time to come.

732
01:01:58,189 --> 01:02:02,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We inform you this sad news with gratefulness for your kindness during his lifetime.

733
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:09,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Funeral service was held with his family in very few relations, following his wishes for tranquility.

734
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:15,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We respectfully inform you that we would not accept flowers, condolence gifts, visiting offerings, and others.

735
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:21,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we would ask you to refrain from conducting interviews with his family.

736
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Future plans for commemorate gathering is not decided.

737
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,629
[SPEAKER_09]: We will let you know when it's confirmed.

738
01:02:26,629 --> 01:02:29,992
[SPEAKER_09]: We deeply thank you for your understanding and support as always.

739
01:02:29,992 --> 01:02:34,497
[SPEAKER_09]: March 8th, 2024, Bird Studio, Capsule Corporation, Tokyo.

740
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would almost guarantee that one of those projects that was in development is Dragon Quest XII, and it's going to make that game really heavy, I think, when that game comes out, kind of knowing that that's very likely the last thing he's contributing to.

741
01:02:51,994 --> 01:02:53,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he had a work staff.

742
01:02:53,415 --> 01:02:59,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who his official successor was.

743
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see if I can find out a little bit more about that.

744
01:03:02,522 --> 01:03:06,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know Dragon Quest XI was seven years ago at this point?

745
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:07,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that wild to think about?

746
01:03:09,614 --> 01:03:11,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, okay.

747
01:03:11,256 --> 01:03:13,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew the name.

748
01:03:13,337 --> 01:03:30,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, Toyotaro, um, is, uh, he started off, uh, drawing, um, uh, a lot of, uh, you know, related manga, but he also did the manga for Dragon Ball Super.

749
01:03:30,712 --> 01:03:38,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I think he is, uh, he's, uh, Toriyama's successor.

750
01:03:38,238 --> 01:03:38,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

751
01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:45,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's also done a lot of, he taught himself by doing fan art.

752
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:50,059
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you ever think that your fan art isn't going to go anywhere, think again.

753
01:03:52,290 --> 01:04:10,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, and I think a lot of gamers looking back fondly on, you know, the contributions to gaming culture through whether it be Dragon Quest or Dragon Warrior, as a lot of us discovered it as here on this side of the ocean when we were kids, or I think obviously the huge impact of Chrono Trigger, like, you know, you're talking about there.

754
01:04:10,956 --> 01:04:18,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that is a game that, you know, if you were of a certain age when that game came out, you were impacted by, you know, Toriyama's art at some point.

755
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:23,519
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

756
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:45,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Chrono Cross was the true successor of Radical Dreamers

757
01:05:04,062 --> 01:05:14,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, uh, obviously a tremendous loss for, you know, especially, you know, Japanese influence because, you know, Dragon Quest is big enough here.

758
01:05:14,264 --> 01:05:21,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a lot of people know that, but think about how monumentally influential the Dragon Quest series is in Japan is.

759
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:27,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it is a huge, huge loss for the gaming industry in Japan.

760
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:31,908
[SPEAKER_09]: We watched an anime that was based on someone.

761
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:41,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, like virtually playing a Dragon Quest game and ended up thinking he was really the character.

762
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:44,573
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it was a pretty good show.

763
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:45,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

764
01:05:45,293 --> 01:05:45,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not know this.

765
01:05:45,893 --> 01:05:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says apparently 20 to 30,000 showed up in the center of Buenos Aires today in support.

766
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:55,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Ball is as big in South America as it was in Japan and elsewhere.

767
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:58,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't, I I'm surprised, but I'm not.

768
01:05:59,943 --> 01:06:06,807
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's there's a lot of people here where it's not as popular that are definitely feeling this loss.

769
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:17,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I always thought it was kind of I was a little bit jealous that, yes, there it's much been translated into Spanish Phoenix, and that's what was going on.

770
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:23,936
[SPEAKER_09]: The original Dragon Ball Z opening song, which is probably one of my favorite anime theme songs ever, is Challa Head Challa.

771
01:06:23,936 --> 01:06:28,619
[SPEAKER_09]: That had been directly translated into Spanish for Dragon Ball Z.

772
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,962
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

773
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:47,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

774
01:07:13,649 --> 01:07:14,952
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

775
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:21,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay, let's move on to a story we've been kind of bouncing back and forth on earlier in the show.

776
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:23,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's let's bring this up to the table now.

777
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:24,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki, I'm gonna turn it over to you.

778
01:07:25,464 --> 01:07:34,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Warner Brothers Discovery is going to be retiring several games that are part of Adult Swim games.

779
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:39,028
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes, you know, I think they had, what was it?

780
01:07:39,028 --> 01:07:46,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Headlander, Rain World, Kingsway, Volgar the Viking, Battle Chef Brigade.

781
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:53,272
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another one, Small Radios, Big Televisions was actually kind of, I think what kind of kicked it off the developer of that

782
01:07:53,812 --> 01:08:01,658
[SPEAKER_01]: said that they he had received a notice from Warner Brothers that they're going to be delisting those games.

783
01:08:01,658 --> 01:08:04,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to happen within the next 60 days.

784
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:09,404
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be let's let's also mention that guy pulled the power move of I'm just going to put it up for free.

785
01:08:09,404 --> 01:08:10,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.

786
01:08:10,906 --> 01:08:13,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was which I salute you.

787
01:08:13,868 --> 01:08:15,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I salute you for doing that.

788
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:17,451
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the ultimate FU.

789
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:20,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at that point, you're probably not making anything off of it anyway.

790
01:08:20,253 --> 01:08:21,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but I

791
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great for him.

792
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:36,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, along with that, and thanks to our background that we have here, there is also the notification that Warner Brothers Discovery is shutting down Rooster Teeth as well.

793
01:08:36,941 --> 01:08:40,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're ending the operations after 20 plus years.

794
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:47,449
[SPEAKER_01]: This was announced via a company memo that was put up on their website.

795
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:49,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I believe they said,

796
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:56,255
[SPEAKER_01]: that the, I think that they're trying to sell off the podcast for it, but everything else is shutting down.

797
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:57,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez.

798
01:08:57,435 --> 01:08:58,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Which sucks.

799
01:08:58,436 --> 01:09:14,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked Roasted Teeth and all the stuff that they had, especially early machinima stuff, you know, back in the day when that was kind of like the first kind of emerging video game type content, they kind of even, you know, kicked off the whole let's play type of trend as well.

800
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:19,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly influential in the space, but yeah, it sucks.

801
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:24,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix 7726 in chat says Warner seems to be fucking up everywhere.

802
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:39,857
[SPEAKER_07]: From our perspective, yes, but from the investor and capitalist perspective, no, because Zaslav is excellent at exploiting what I believe this practice is, exploiting these tax loopholes we have in this country that allow companies to profit off of art in this way.

803
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:42,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And quite frankly, I wish Congress would take up this issue.

804
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of people are saying, doesn't Congress have better things to do?

805
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:48,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably, but guess what?

806
01:09:48,703 --> 01:09:49,704
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't get that done either.

807
01:09:50,124 --> 01:10:03,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that when we're talking about these tax loopholes that these huge corporations are making money off of by burning art and writing it off, I'm sorry, if you burn art like Coyote vs. Acme, that shit should become public domain.

808
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:11,692
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have wrote it off for a public loss, you have sold that to the public as far as I'm concerned, and now that ought to be public domain.

809
01:10:12,532 --> 01:10:16,076
[SPEAKER_07]: That is that is how you should be able to claim a tax break off of that.

810
01:10:16,076 --> 01:10:17,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.

811
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:20,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And frankly, I don't think it should be such a huge tax break anyway.

812
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:22,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's probably what they're doing with this as well.

813
01:10:22,544 --> 01:10:23,305
[SPEAKER_07]: These are games.

814
01:10:23,305 --> 01:10:27,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, to your credit, these are games that are 10 to 15 years old at this point, to be fair.

815
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,572
[SPEAKER_07]: These are very old games that are taking off Steam.

816
01:10:29,572 --> 01:10:29,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

817
01:10:31,004 --> 01:10:33,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can probably take a tax write off on it.

818
01:10:33,126 --> 01:10:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to claim probably more than what they would have actually gotten from this whole thing.

819
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just it's cooking the books.

820
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:46,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just I wish I wish Congress would take a look at this, but they won't because they can't do anything.

821
01:10:46,036 --> 01:10:47,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever.

822
01:10:49,919 --> 01:10:55,524
[SPEAKER_07]: SG100 Matt says devs will have to change their games credits to not include Adult Swim games.

823
01:10:55,524 --> 01:11:00,208
[SPEAKER_07]: They should change the thank you portion of their games credits to Fire David Zaslav.

824
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:01,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love that personally.

825
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:10,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix7726 says, Rob, also the decision to change HBO Max to Max was also foolish.

826
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:16,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost as bad as Twitter to X. Not that bad, but let me just put it this way.

827
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:19,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't subscribe, but I didn't subscribe then.

828
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:20,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't subscribe now.

829
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not exactly in a hurry to, to be honest.

830
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:28,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I I am kind of like it's not it's not that bad.

831
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:32,212
[SPEAKER_07]: The Twitter to X thing is there's no point for it.

832
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:37,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll notice for all the talk of wanting to own the town square.

833
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:40,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all know what you're doing by get me going on a Twitter rant.

834
01:11:41,513 --> 01:11:46,035
[SPEAKER_07]: The Town Square has decided, we reject that.

835
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:51,577
[SPEAKER_07]: The council has heard your idea, we think it's a stupid idea, and so we're going to ignore it.

836
01:11:51,577 --> 01:11:54,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That is exactly what's happening with the whole X thing.

837
01:11:54,078 --> 01:12:04,662
[SPEAKER_07]: The people aren't calling it that because that is a stupid name for a failing company that is nothing but porn bots now at this point in replies and things like that.

838
01:12:06,377 --> 01:12:17,209
[SPEAKER_07]: It's I I really don't know how Twitter is still operating to be quite honest, but whatever it is what it is.

839
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:18,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

840
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:21,935
[SPEAKER_07]: S200 Matt says the town square now deletes community notes when they feel like it.

841
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:22,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Well,

842
01:12:26,246 --> 01:12:29,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all keep using it and see how that goes for you.

843
01:12:29,029 --> 01:12:33,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm telling you how to make an impact, but it's I get it.

844
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:34,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

845
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:43,463
[SPEAKER_09]: The big thing that they've been doing is removing community notes when people have posted certain pro

846
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:45,566
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

847
01:13:02,225 --> 01:13:04,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all know what you can do about it if you don't like it.

848
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:06,790
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that and I've said it a million times on blue in the face.

849
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll just move on.

850
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:09,773
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

851
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:11,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, this WB thing.

852
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:12,756
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

853
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:14,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate that they keep getting away with it.

854
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:21,285
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we need to keep browsing the rabble rabble that you know what this this practice should not be as legal as it is.

855
01:13:22,025 --> 01:13:23,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

856
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:44,766
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, it would take one hero to fix this Coyote vs. Acme situation.

857
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:45,947
[SPEAKER_07]: One hero.

858
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:47,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people out there that could do it.

859
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:49,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's several people out there that could do it.

860
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:54,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Because keep in mind, they were shopping that movie around to actual studios.

861
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:56,175
[SPEAKER_07]: They were shopping that movie around.

862
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:57,296
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they shop the movie around?

863
01:13:57,296 --> 01:13:59,357
[SPEAKER_07]: They gotta show it.

864
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:01,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So that movie's sitting on a hard drive somewhere.

865
01:14:01,879 --> 01:14:05,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And one hero could change the narrative significantly on all of this.

866
01:14:09,284 --> 01:14:12,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

867
01:14:12,785 --> 01:14:14,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Podculture says I want to see Batgirl dammit.

868
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:17,766
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is Batgirl was not as finished of a film.

869
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:24,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was that the special effects and those types of things were not finished, and so forth or what actually exists of that.

870
01:14:24,347 --> 01:14:29,388
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, as a tax write off, whatever was done should be belong to the public now.

871
01:14:29,388 --> 01:14:32,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe we would see different public interpretations of what that movie should look like.

872
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:33,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

873
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway,

874
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:43,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Sj100mat says someone offered to cover the expenses to show Coyote vs Acme at South by Southwest to help shop it.

875
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:47,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Warner Brothers Discovery still said no.

876
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:53,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Def says one hero that will probably get blacklisted in the industry, but it will make a statement and will be remembered as a hero by many.

877
01:14:53,023 --> 01:14:53,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

878
01:14:54,264 --> 01:14:55,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

879
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

880
01:14:56,266 --> 01:15:04,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on and talk about this, which I feel like this topic has kind of come up before, but we have some kind of definitive statements on this.

881
01:15:04,412 --> 01:15:14,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth and, you know, Reborn or whatever the ultimate third version is called at some point when the trilogy finishes here.

882
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:18,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something we're ever going to see on Xbox Game Pass?

883
01:15:18,023 --> 01:15:20,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is definitively no.

884
01:15:20,085 --> 01:15:30,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though there have been other titles like Final Fantasy XIII, you know, other Final Fantasy XII, other games that have made their way to Xbox Game Pass eventually, the Final Fantasy VII trilogy will not be one of them.

885
01:15:30,915 --> 01:15:39,282
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from a comment that Christian Svensson, who is the vice president of second and third party content at Sony Interactive Entertainment said, which is,

886
01:15:40,063 --> 01:15:47,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Securing the Final Fantasy VII Trilogy as a console exclusive is a feather in the PlayStation cap.

887
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:52,550
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of recognizing the original game's importance as a defining game for the PlayStation experience.

888
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:59,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in that same console generation, the original PlayStation, Sony Computer Entertainment had few franchises of its own.

889
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:07,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And in order to find a place in a very competitive video game industry, we sought to win the hearts and mind of key third party developers like Square.

890
01:16:07,137 --> 01:16:09,858
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a that is very much a true statement.

891
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:13,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 7 is when I started paying attention to Sony.

892
01:16:13,299 --> 01:16:16,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So that that's a very true statement.

893
01:16:16,941 --> 01:16:18,781
[SPEAKER_07]: But also a very definitive answer.

894
01:16:18,781 --> 01:16:20,982
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a console exclusive.

895
01:16:20,982 --> 01:16:21,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll come out on PC.

896
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:26,737
[SPEAKER_07]: not gonna happen on Xbox, not gonna happen on Nintendo platforms.

897
01:16:26,737 --> 01:16:28,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

898
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:34,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to play the game, you're gonna have to suck it up and get a PlayStation or wait for the inevitable PC release.

899
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:45,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe hoping it's on a cloud thing that works if ironically, on a cloud thing that works if your PC is not up to muster to be able to run it, but hopefully the technology gets cheaper and all that stuff.

900
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:50,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix says, is it even on Xbox at all?

901
01:16:50,287 --> 01:16:52,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the reboot trilogy.

902
01:16:52,868 --> 01:16:54,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the remake trilogy.

903
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:56,630
[SPEAKER_07]: The original FF7 is, I believe.

904
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:59,691
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that also came to PC at some point.

905
01:16:59,691 --> 01:17:00,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That all is.

906
01:17:04,233 --> 01:17:11,581
[SPEAKER_07]: But Phoenix also points out, Rob, on the flip side, Final Fantasy XIV was also thought to not come out to Xbox originally, but it did eventually.

907
01:17:11,581 --> 01:17:13,883
[SPEAKER_07]: That was never secured as an exclusive, though.

908
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:16,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing about Final Fantasy XIV.

909
01:17:16,646 --> 01:17:26,256
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually played it on PC, when it first came out for PC, if you plug in a controller, all the button mappings were Xbox branded.

910
01:17:28,654 --> 01:17:32,275
[SPEAKER_07]: It was to the Windows Xbox specifications.

911
01:17:32,275 --> 01:17:33,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's even true now.

912
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:36,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You plug in a controller, you're going to see Xbox branding.

913
01:17:36,596 --> 01:17:56,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was always an interesting gap, but it was assumed that it was one between Square and Microsoft and some type of Xbox limitation of them not wanting the game on the platform because of the cross-play, which was always ridiculous because Final Fantasy XI was a thing.

914
01:17:56,639 --> 01:17:58,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody fucking forgets.

915
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI was a thing.

916
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:06,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI broke a lot of fucking rules with all of this.

917
01:18:06,262 --> 01:18:08,022
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it.

918
01:18:08,022 --> 01:18:13,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And Final Fantasy XI, to be fair, continues to still be a thing, although it is exclusive to PC at this point.

919
01:18:13,864 --> 01:18:19,885
[SPEAKER_07]: They no longer support it on any of the console versions, but kind of interesting.

920
01:18:19,885 --> 01:18:20,186
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

921
01:18:20,186 --> 01:18:24,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's move on to some exciting and unsurprising news.

922
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:25,127
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

923
01:18:26,877 --> 01:18:33,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, oh, I'm just enjoying the quiet all of a sudden.

924
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:40,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I'm very proud of the Activision QA workers.

925
01:18:40,764 --> 01:18:53,010
[SPEAKER_09]: They have gotten together 600-some-odd workers from Activision's Publishing's Quality Assurance Department and have formed a union.

926
01:18:54,218 --> 01:19:05,152
[SPEAKER_09]: They were assisted by the Communications Workers of America and they completed their vote which had them certified by the 8th, a couple days ago.

927
01:19:05,152 --> 01:19:09,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they are now Activision Quality Assurance United.

928
01:19:09,697 --> 01:19:10,238
[SPEAKER_09]: They are

929
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:18,829
[SPEAKER_09]: basically rising out of Microsoft's gaming division to put their foot down.

930
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:25,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft did, as we know, affirm a labor neutrality agreement with the CWA before.

931
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,842
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just I think this is this is great.

932
01:19:31,842 --> 01:19:48,150
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the quote from Tom Shelley, who is one of their specialists with that group, says that this has been an emergent effort that's arisen in the last few weeks in response to the opportunities we've had to freely organize following the merger.

933
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:54,213
[SPEAKER_09]: As QA workers, we often have the weakest protections and lowest pay of any workers in history in the industry.

934
01:19:54,213 --> 01:19:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

935
01:19:54,973 --> 01:20:00,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though our work is integral to the success of the companies we work for and the titles we make.

936
01:20:00,182 --> 01:20:02,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen to that.

937
01:20:02,525 --> 01:20:07,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I think that that's awesome.

938
01:20:07,373 --> 01:20:09,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we're seeing a little bit more

939
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:25,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great that Microsoft themselves have done some work to recognize other unions as well, like the ZeniMax online union.

940
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:34,849
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're really seeing a lot more unionization in the industry, and I'm super proud of that.

941
01:20:34,849 --> 01:20:40,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I would need to see what was going on with that complaint against Sega.

942
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:47,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to Microsoft's credit, I think they know this is just a train that can't be stopped.

943
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:49,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not trying to take the perspective of stopping it.

944
01:20:49,449 --> 01:20:55,754
[SPEAKER_07]: They're taking the perspective of coping or how do they, you know, make it work in their vision and so forth.

945
01:20:55,754 --> 01:20:58,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's where Microsoft's at.

946
01:20:58,256 --> 01:21:04,481
[SPEAKER_09]: A company literally does come out looking like the bad guy by union busting and sitting against it.

947
01:21:04,481 --> 01:21:06,763
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we hear union busting.

948
01:21:06,763 --> 01:21:09,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know, my thoughts go back to historical, you know,

949
01:21:12,728 --> 01:21:14,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really, really quite pleased to see all of this.

950
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:37,116
[SPEAKER_09]: leaning in toward this collaboration and unionization going on.

951
01:21:37,116 --> 01:21:39,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very happy about it.

952
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:45,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish other companies would hop on board.

953
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:47,490
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and I

954
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:54,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I know of some in the tech industry that are working on.

955
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see something coming from that.

956
01:21:56,529 --> 01:22:04,335
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot that's still very, very quiet that I think we're going to see some very surprising things come up through the year.

957
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:10,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree this is going to continue this this more.

958
01:22:10,988 --> 01:22:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is the biggest one as of now, but I think there's going to be bigger coming.

959
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:21,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So especially in light of everything that's happened with the layoffs and everything in this industry, I think you're going to see you're going to see more.

960
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:22,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So Union.

961
01:22:22,819 --> 01:22:23,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

962
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

963
01:22:27,882 --> 01:22:29,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, going back.

964
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, you're loving to talk about this company tonight, aren't you?

965
01:22:31,705 --> 01:22:33,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Warner some more.

966
01:22:33,126 --> 01:22:36,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's kick him a little more.

967
01:22:36,848 --> 01:22:53,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Warner Brothers saw the success of Suicide Squad, in other words, their below expectation Suicide Squad, being a live service game for one, and that not a lot of people liked that, and they didn't like how the game seemed to be

968
01:22:54,700 --> 01:23:02,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Rushed but also not rushed in the sense that it would took a long time, but still sucked So you know what they said?

969
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:11,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what instead of going back to the drawing board and maybe making another AAA single-player game They're like now we're gonna double down on live service games.

970
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:16,370
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that's what they're planning on doing because they're saying that it's

971
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:22,983
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to release games and have one flop like this.

972
01:23:22,983 --> 01:23:27,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially it makes their year bad or something.

973
01:23:27,245 --> 01:23:40,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what the push is here is that, well, we could churn out like say four, not so great live service games, but we'd earn extra money with people buying all the monetization with that, I think is the thought process.

974
01:23:42,677 --> 01:23:44,578
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so stupid.

975
01:23:44,578 --> 01:23:53,360
[SPEAKER_07]: This is I mean, I'm sorry, this is and then this leads to them writing off more games and selling off gaming history and deleting it from Steam and stuff.

976
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,302
[SPEAKER_07]: This is this is so well on top of that, you have these games.

977
01:23:57,302 --> 01:23:59,322
[SPEAKER_07]: How stupid do they think gamers are?

978
01:23:59,322 --> 01:24:01,623
[SPEAKER_07]: How well stupid do they think gamers are?

979
01:24:02,415 --> 01:24:25,885
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, like if you want to go back to, you know, throwing art into, you know, basically just pissing all over artwork, you know, live service games like this, typically when they shut down the servers for those after, obviously, it's not going to be a very long time, I'll be surprised if this game lasts a year, they stop working, which sucks for preservation in the first place as all, so.

980
01:24:29,686 --> 01:24:37,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how these companies think that with 500 live service games in the pipeline

981
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:41,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where are you going to get the player base for that?

982
01:24:41,752 --> 01:24:43,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's not going to happen.

983
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:47,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the MMO issue all over again.

984
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:49,658
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft comes out.

985
01:24:49,658 --> 01:25:00,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody thinks they can make a game with a monthly fee and make an MMO and charge a monthly fee for it, because that's that's the solution to keep printing money is to just charge a monthly fee for your game.

986
01:25:00,385 --> 01:25:02,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what happens?

987
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:08,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick, name a successful MMO outside of World of Warcraft not called Final Fantasy.

988
01:25:11,496 --> 01:25:13,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to take you a minute to think of them.

989
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:14,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Eve Online.

990
01:25:14,783 --> 01:25:18,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Eve, well, even currently, is Eve Online still going?

991
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:18,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Elder Scrolls.

992
01:25:20,963 --> 01:25:22,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Lineage EverQuest Elder Scrolls

993
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:48,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Sj100mat says, but in their defense, folks still buy into these things.

994
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:52,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not keep throwing crap at the wall to see what sticks for continuing to fund a game?

995
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:55,232
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and don't get me wrong.

996
01:25:55,232 --> 01:25:58,253
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to have a player base of people that do support these types of games.

997
01:25:58,253 --> 01:25:59,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be enough to pay the people who made the game.

998
01:25:59,974 --> 01:26:01,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, exactly though.

999
01:26:01,135 --> 01:26:05,358
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the thing though, is you have a player base right now of these people, but

1000
01:26:06,258 --> 01:26:15,765
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't spread that to 500 games like it's just it's not physically gonna happen like one people have a finite amount of time and money so like

1001
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to happen.

1002
01:26:18,025 --> 01:26:27,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I get it that you may get, you may pick up some more people with different types of games that may be live service games that you might appeal to some folks that aren't into these other ones.

1003
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:41,045
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of people that don't want to play these types of games because it feels like, because they're like, yeah, we want you to log on and want you to grind and earn, you know, stuff like work, basically work a job at a game.

1004
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:42,687
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, I don't want to do that.

1005
01:26:42,687 --> 01:26:43,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to play a game.

1006
01:26:44,554 --> 01:26:49,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't work a game you could don't even do you even know what games are like?

1007
01:26:49,155 --> 01:26:50,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know it.

1008
01:26:50,155 --> 01:26:52,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling that this is just going to backfire.

1009
01:26:52,656 --> 01:26:53,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1010
01:26:53,316 --> 01:26:58,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And they should take a good hard look at why people aren't buying into Suicide Squad.

1011
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:08,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like there's just so many examples of live service games that are not successful, like a lot of them, tons and tons of them.

1012
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:10,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't understand why this would be a

1013
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they're just naive and think, oh, well, ours will be different.

1014
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:16,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's what everybody says.

1015
01:27:16,805 --> 01:27:18,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and it's just not going to happen.

1016
01:27:18,546 --> 01:27:23,229
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to just put out a quality game instead.

1017
01:27:23,229 --> 01:27:30,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Quest Western Chat says, Meanwhile, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to rack up awards for being a good game that came with everything, and it's still selling.

1018
01:27:30,854 --> 01:27:32,575
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other thing to point out.

1019
01:27:32,575 --> 01:27:33,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still selling.

1020
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:38,399
[SPEAKER_07]: No Man's Sky releases on the Switch years after its original release.

1021
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:39,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still selling.

1022
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:42,965
[SPEAKER_07]: because it puts out all this additional content for free.

1023
01:27:42,965 --> 01:27:47,215
[SPEAKER_07]: These games that are well known and have a reputation for being an all one package.

1024
01:27:47,915 --> 01:27:49,096
[SPEAKER_07]: do just fine for themselves.

1025
01:28:11,334 --> 01:28:18,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, like EA, for example, with their live service games, Predatory Monetization, makes a buttload of money.

1026
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:22,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really what the investors care about in the end.

1027
01:28:22,342 --> 01:28:24,644
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care if the games are absolute trash.

1028
01:28:24,644 --> 01:28:36,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, let's be honest, like when we went going back to EA, a lot of their games are absolute trash in the end, because they just churn the same game every single year, literally copy and pasting for some of these.

1029
01:28:36,673 --> 01:28:36,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And

1030
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:42,307
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an install base that just doesn't care.

1031
01:28:42,307 --> 01:28:46,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you get those people to care, they're going to continue to be exploited.

1032
01:28:46,089 --> 01:28:48,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be the garbage that you get.

1033
01:28:48,251 --> 01:28:53,814
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, there's also all these independent studios and to go support them instead.

1034
01:28:53,814 --> 01:28:57,316
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt says it will have to burst like crypto for them to pivot off.

1035
01:28:57,316 --> 01:29:07,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if this if the failure of Suicide Squad is not the fucking smoke that shows you there's a big dumpster fire brewing, I don't I don't know what to tell these executives and people in power to change their mind.

1036
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:16,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Questbuster in chat says, going back to a statement Rob made earlier, it does feel like WB expected the IP to carry the game.

1037
01:29:16,548 --> 01:29:17,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1038
01:29:17,849 --> 01:29:19,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they did.

1039
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:24,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Because unfortunately, it worked for them when it came to Harry Potter.

1040
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:29,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now they think every game can be that.

1041
01:29:29,301 --> 01:29:30,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1042
01:29:30,262 --> 01:29:31,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1043
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:31,544
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1044
01:29:32,512 --> 01:29:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1045
01:29:33,913 --> 01:29:35,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about this.

1046
01:29:35,033 --> 01:29:36,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is this is kind of sad.

1047
01:29:36,674 --> 01:29:37,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like this company.

1048
01:29:37,714 --> 01:29:42,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you you hate to hear about your faves getting hacked and all this stuff and their stuff getting put all out there.

1049
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:43,917
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also feel like

1050
01:29:48,313 --> 01:29:57,543
[SPEAKER_07]: WayForward is the company, and WayForward has made the Shantae series, they did the Advance Wars 1 and 2 reboot, they did DuckTales Remastered back in the day.

1051
01:29:57,543 --> 01:30:02,950
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, some of the data was, apparently a drive was found somewhere.

1052
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:17,280
[SPEAKER_07]: that allowed prototypes and source code for some old WayForward games to leak out, including Shantae Risky's Revenge, DuckTales Remastered, Adventure Time, Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?

1053
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, that was a real game on the DS.

1054
01:30:18,942 --> 01:30:21,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And some other WayForward DS games as well.

1055
01:30:21,443 --> 01:30:24,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So the code and all this is available online.

1056
01:30:24,286 --> 01:30:27,268
[SPEAKER_07]: There's websites, you can find all the prototypes and all this stuff as well.

1057
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:44,826
[SPEAKER_07]: What is interesting though, the person who said that they are in possession of the data has said they are not leaking anything on the Switch Shantae Advanced Risky Resolution, which is supposed to come out later this year.

1058
01:30:44,826 --> 01:30:47,008
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very interesting.

1059
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,630
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so

1060
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:54,031
[SPEAKER_07]: The old stuff is leaked, but that from my perspective, I'm like, well, it's old stuff.

1061
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:58,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like it's newer way forward titles that are going to, you know, have an impact.

1062
01:30:58,572 --> 01:31:09,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I, and I understand maybe this risky revolution is a concern because the, this was a, that was a title that was originally developed like 20 years ago, and then they shelved it and now they're supposed to resurrect it for the switch.

1063
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:14,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe there's concern about that, but the leaker or whoever has said they're not going to touch that.

1064
01:31:14,876 --> 01:31:17,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of interesting that they are, um,

1065
01:31:18,649 --> 01:31:21,198
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1066
01:31:25,865 --> 01:31:30,506
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, DuckTales Remastered is how old now?

1067
01:31:30,506 --> 01:31:32,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably not going to hurt them tremendously to have this out there.

1068
01:31:32,747 --> 01:31:36,388
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was newer titles, I think people would care more.

1069
01:31:36,388 --> 01:31:48,972
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is probably one of those things where it's like, it's actually probably better the less WayForward talks about it, because then the less the news trickles down to people like us and other websites to then remind you that this information is out there should you choose to seek it out.

1070
01:31:48,972 --> 01:31:53,954
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, from where I'm sitting, I see no need to seek it out.

1071
01:31:54,594 --> 01:31:57,920
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be people out there very curious on how games work.

1072
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,102
[SPEAKER_07]: How did they do that?

1073
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:00,344
[SPEAKER_07]: How did they code that?

1074
01:32:00,344 --> 01:32:01,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to do something like that.

1075
01:32:01,867 --> 01:32:04,351
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be other people out there that are seeking that sort of thing out.

1076
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:04,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, I'm not.

1077
01:32:08,371 --> 01:32:12,315
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura also reminds us they have Contra OG dropping in a couple days.

1078
01:32:12,315 --> 01:32:14,598
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a demo on Xbox that apparently is pretty good.

1079
01:32:14,598 --> 01:32:16,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot there was a demo out there.

1080
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1081
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check that out at some point.

1082
01:32:19,443 --> 01:32:20,364
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1083
01:32:20,364 --> 01:32:27,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with all of these OG titles we're talking about all of a sudden, there's really only one segment that would be appropriate to do next.

1084
01:32:38,368 --> 01:32:46,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1085
01:32:46,115 --> 01:32:49,278
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1086
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:54,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And what did you pick for the other Classic Game of the Week this week, DarkSakura?

1087
01:32:54,082 --> 01:32:59,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked a mindfuck of a game called Purirura.

1088
01:32:59,887 --> 01:33:02,369
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an arcade game that came out in 1981 by Taito.

1089
01:33:06,009 --> 01:33:14,614
[SPEAKER_09]: It later came out on the FM Towns Marty, the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 in Japan.

1090
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:20,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Although the PS1 and Saturn versions are called Puri Rura Arcade Gears.

1091
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:29,465
[SPEAKER_09]: The PS2 version is part of a compilation from Taito Memories Volume 1 that did not come out in the international release of Taito Legends.

1092
01:33:29,465 --> 01:33:32,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fucking weird-ass beat-em-up game.

1093
01:33:34,828 --> 01:33:42,692
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Puli Rula takes place in this area called Radishland.

1094
01:33:42,692 --> 01:33:50,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a place where they keep time flowing properly with a time key.

1095
01:33:50,155 --> 01:33:53,836
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a quote from the English translation.

1096
01:34:05,282 --> 01:34:15,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So you play as characters named Zack and Mel and are requested by an old guy to go

1097
01:34:17,034 --> 01:34:22,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat up all the bad guys with a magic stick.

1098
01:34:22,076 --> 01:34:29,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So player one is Zack, player two is Mel, who is actually based on Little Bo Peep.

1099
01:34:29,918 --> 01:34:35,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to just fight the enemies until you hit a boss at the end of the area.

1100
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:40,121
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're hit, you get turned into an animal and run off screen.

1101
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:45,043
[SPEAKER_09]: You get points if you walk into animals.

1102
01:34:45,043 --> 01:34:45,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is...

1103
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:55,099
[SPEAKER_09]: For those watching live right now, I'm sure you can see the kind of bizarreness about this.

1104
01:34:55,099 --> 01:35:01,303
[SPEAKER_09]: You have some weird-ass enemies that you fight.

1105
01:35:01,303 --> 01:35:06,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And you kind of walk around in, I don't know, it kind of reminds me of Old Flash a little bit.

1106
01:35:08,735 --> 01:35:14,262
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is a little bit of controversy.

1107
01:35:14,262 --> 01:35:20,050
[SPEAKER_09]: The original version had this area where

1108
01:35:21,164 --> 01:35:35,068
[SPEAKER_09]: You're basically, you've got like this wall with a kind of an arch in the center and two open arches to either side of it and out of the two side ones are legs.

1109
01:35:35,068 --> 01:35:42,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of like you're looking up a pair of ladies legs wearing red thigh highs.

1110
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:47,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And occasionally pink elephants come out of there.

1111
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:54,391
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an international release of this, and they omitted that.

1112
01:35:54,391 --> 01:35:55,815
[SPEAKER_09]: This is only the Japanese version.

1113
01:35:59,014 --> 01:36:04,358
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's just a really visually... Midna, get down!

1114
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:07,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, my cat was clawing up my other chair.

1115
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:12,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a really weird visually game.

1116
01:36:12,443 --> 01:36:16,366
[SPEAKER_09]: You beat up the bad guys and they turn into animals and they're cute.

1117
01:36:16,366 --> 01:36:23,251
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the really weird boss that kind of freaks me out because it looks like she's pogo-sticking off of her nose.

1118
01:36:23,251 --> 01:36:26,994
[SPEAKER_09]: She's just a head with a huge nose and red boots.

1119
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:27,254
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah.

1120
01:36:28,586 --> 01:36:29,707
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of fun, though.

1121
01:36:29,707 --> 01:36:36,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you can get past the weird, it's pretty fun.

1122
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:39,511
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some nods to this game, though.

1123
01:36:39,511 --> 01:36:50,736
[SPEAKER_09]: In Bubble Symphony, you know, in the Bubble Bobble series, or Puzzle Bobble, I should say, there's a stage that's based on Puli Rula.

1124
01:36:52,536 --> 01:36:57,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Enemies and the boss characters are from this game.

1125
01:36:57,738 --> 01:37:05,700
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a limited edition soundtrack by Pony Canyon released July 17, 1992.

1126
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:11,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And the character Zack was also an assist character for Arkanoid vs Space Invaders on iOS and Android in 2016.

1127
01:37:13,562 --> 01:37:18,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And one last thing, an anime that I have.

1128
01:37:18,123 --> 01:37:22,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is the one where they have the digitized person who comes up at the screen.

1129
01:37:22,564 --> 01:37:26,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, like I said, weird ass game.

1130
01:37:26,585 --> 01:37:35,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Zack and Mel have a cameo in episode 17 of High Score Girl, which is an anime I am pretty fond of.

1131
01:37:35,646 --> 01:37:37,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

1132
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1133
01:37:39,307 --> 01:37:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

1134
01:37:41,808 --> 01:37:42,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the enjoy the

1135
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:47,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Brain Crack.

1136
01:37:47,706 --> 01:37:48,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Go play it.

1137
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:51,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Podculture in chat says, God, I'm glad I'm sober watching this.

1138
01:37:51,529 --> 01:37:53,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, very.

1139
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:59,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if you were on a particular substance or two, this this would be even weirder.

1140
01:37:59,293 --> 01:38:04,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, and people listening at home, just go back and watch the VOD at this point.

1141
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:04,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1142
01:38:04,757 --> 01:38:08,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just, you know, it's very easy to find the footage of this game if you know how to spell.

1143
01:38:09,428 --> 01:38:11,670
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the name of the game?

1144
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:35,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's P U Asterix L like Lima, I like Indigo Asterix R like Romeo, U like Uniform Asterix L like Lima, A like Alpha So, and between every syllable the P U L I R U L A the asterix is necessary because that's how the game is spelled

1145
01:38:37,628 --> 01:38:43,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good thing that but in the background is covered or we might be in violation of Terms of Service right now.

1146
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:47,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a sumo.

1147
01:38:47,392 --> 01:38:51,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know, but it doesn't leave much to the imagination.

1148
01:38:51,834 --> 01:38:54,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it's traditional.

1149
01:38:54,735 --> 01:38:56,596
[SPEAKER_09]: We can say it's artistic.

1150
01:38:56,596 --> 01:38:56,876
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1151
01:38:58,188 --> 01:39:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe I should take the footage down at this point.

1152
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:08,852
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is this is this actually my favorite stage that we were just showing was the fighting the Kabuki actor.

1153
01:39:08,852 --> 01:39:18,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, some folks in chat were suggesting this would have been a great candidate for your flag segment last year, which, you know, once a month DarkSakura mixes it up.

1154
01:39:18,115 --> 01:39:20,716
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought this was an arcade game.

1155
01:39:20,716 --> 01:39:21,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, I was

1156
01:39:23,007 --> 01:39:27,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I was more going for like the physical arcade games, I guess.

1157
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:27,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I get it.

1158
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1159
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:32,513
[SPEAKER_07]: But well, I just go back to there's only 12 months in a year, right?

1160
01:39:32,513 --> 01:39:34,774
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's going to be more weird arcade games.

1161
01:39:34,774 --> 01:39:41,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a hard time finding things sometimes, but no, but this this I look at games like this in

1162
01:39:42,259 --> 01:39:44,700
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as actual game in the category.

1163
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:56,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think the most interesting part of it, because I did not know this game, but I think when you were talking about the appearances that it had in other games, I think it's always interesting to kind of know where that came from.

1164
01:39:56,102 --> 01:39:58,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, oh, interesting.

1165
01:39:58,122 --> 01:40:06,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, that's what I like to bring that up, because that way, you know, like why are there pink elephants in this?

1166
01:40:06,424 --> 01:40:09,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I also think it's funny because

1167
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:25,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The concept of the pink elephant is, and you actually saw some of it in old Winnie the Pooh, is that pink elephants are meant to be a hallucination.

1168
01:40:25,794 --> 01:40:34,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that you used to mix your metaphors before by saying pink elephant in the room, which would indicate that everybody was hallucinating.

1169
01:40:34,717 --> 01:40:35,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they are.

1170
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:54,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but, uh, so that just to me lends even more to, uh, the, uh, the whole fever dream part of this by having, you know, a building with lady legs with pink elephants coming out of the Twatl region.

1171
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, PogCulture in chat says drugs were involved with this.

1172
01:40:59,841 --> 01:41:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me, let me tell you something about some of your favorite Atari 2600 games of the 80s.

1173
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:09,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me, let me tell you some things about how those aggressive deadlines were met.

1174
01:41:09,983 --> 01:41:10,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1175
01:41:10,704 --> 01:41:11,264
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1176
01:41:11,264 --> 01:41:14,385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, it's, it's definitely, you know what?

1177
01:41:14,385 --> 01:41:21,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I might have to bust this out on stream someday just to say, Hey, get ready to hallucinate.

1178
01:41:21,426 --> 01:41:22,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1179
01:41:22,406 --> 01:41:23,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your shots ready.

1180
01:41:23,727 --> 01:41:24,447
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to need them.

1181
01:41:27,128 --> 01:41:33,293
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's cover a couple other quick headlines here with some rapid fire news.

1182
01:41:33,293 --> 01:41:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we'll go to you.

1183
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:36,356
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1184
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:47,966
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Helldivers 2 Studio Arrowhead Game Studio has had to go to social media to let people know, hey, no, we are not being acquired by Sony.

1185
01:41:47,966 --> 01:41:51,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to let you know, they're not being acquired by Sony.

1186
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:52,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the update.

1187
01:41:55,761 --> 01:42:02,784
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Temtem is going to stop receiving content updates.

1188
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:17,630
[SPEAKER_01]: The devs have apologized for its shortcomings, but they said that patch 1.8 will complete the transition, allowing for players to cycle through previous season passes in order to reduce FOMO.

1189
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:20,811
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not going to be adding any more content at the end.

1190
01:42:20,811 --> 01:42:23,292
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to be recycling the old stuff.

1191
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:23,652
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1192
01:42:25,691 --> 01:42:26,052
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1193
01:42:35,117 --> 01:42:40,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting a little bit more love from Microsoft.

1194
01:42:40,160 --> 01:43:03,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Game Pass subscribers or PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate that have Boostroid memberships can stream Game Pass titles or things purchased through the Microsoft Store on Windows through Boostroid, including games like Deathloop, Dishonored, Dishonored 2, Gears, Stuff, Ghostwire Tokyo, Pentament.

1195
01:43:03,576 --> 01:43:04,777
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

1196
01:43:05,798 --> 01:43:19,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have a 10-year deal with the Boostroid company that's from Kiev, Ukraine.

1197
01:43:19,137 --> 01:43:20,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So, cool.

1198
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:22,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Wordle Knockoffs

1199
01:43:42,118 --> 01:43:46,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently some DMCA's have gone out recently.

1200
01:43:46,022 --> 01:43:54,130
[SPEAKER_07]: The New York Times filed a notice against Chase Wackerfuss, who is behind a Wordle clone called Reactl.

1201
01:43:54,130 --> 01:44:02,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently this was up on GitHub, so they're saying that GitHub has to delete the infringing repository and all of the forked repositories that came off of this.

1202
01:44:03,759 --> 01:44:14,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Chase Wackerfuss who the notice was against has already taken down the GitHub page saying it's not worth getting into a legal battle with the New York Times over this.

1203
01:44:14,365 --> 01:44:29,494
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it was forked, which is when somebody kind of takes a derivative of that, 1,900 times before it was removed and used to create other versions of Wordles in different languages, spin-offs with twists, crossword, two-player games, and so forth.

1204
01:44:29,494 --> 01:44:30,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hmm.

1205
01:44:31,915 --> 01:44:37,200
[SPEAKER_07]: The newspaper, The Times, is claiming ownership of the name Wordle and the mechanics.

1206
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:50,251
[SPEAKER_07]: The Times' Wordle copyright includes the unique elements of its immensely popular games, such as the 5x6 grid, green titles to indicate correct guesses, yellow titles to indicate the correct letter but the wrong place, and the keyboard directly beneath the grid.

1207
01:44:50,251 --> 01:44:52,112
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a stretch, I'm sorry.

1208
01:44:52,112 --> 01:44:58,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The gameplay is copied exactly in the repository, and the owner instructs others how to knock off the game and create an identical word game.

1209
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, it's not like Wordle is a very hard game to make.

1210
01:45:04,863 --> 01:45:08,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't I don't know to what extent the York Times is going to keep chasing this down.

1211
01:45:08,446 --> 01:45:10,868
[SPEAKER_07]: But well, I hope you enjoyed that.

1212
01:45:10,868 --> 01:45:15,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you enjoyed that fun trip down memory lane of like, remember Wordle?

1213
01:45:15,171 --> 01:45:23,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when that game had a chokehold on everybody and then the Times bought it and a lot of people were like, yeah, I'm over it.

1214
01:45:23,957 --> 01:45:24,277
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1215
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:32,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's travel around the world and check out some dates of games that are coming out that are new, unlike Wordle.

1216
01:45:32,352 --> 01:45:34,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot this week, that's for sure.

1217
01:45:34,513 --> 01:45:35,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1218
01:45:35,293 --> 01:45:37,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a few things.

1219
01:45:37,654 --> 01:45:42,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Contra Operation Galuga on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.

1220
01:45:42,635 --> 01:45:44,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that game Dr. C was talking about earlier.

1221
01:45:44,456 --> 01:45:45,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1222
01:45:45,316 --> 01:45:47,457
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1227
01:45:52,904 --> 01:45:59,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the last person in the internet to get that joke.

1228
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:02,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Llamasoft, the Jeff Minter story.

[SPEAKER_07]: That was genuine.

1233
01:46:08,311 --> 01:46:09,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved the last.

1234
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:12,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

1235
01:46:12,753 --> 01:46:14,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that Gold Master Series.

1236
01:46:14,594 --> 01:46:16,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the Karateka one.

1237
01:46:16,275 --> 01:46:18,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't realize this was around the corner.

1238
01:46:18,356 --> 01:46:18,736

01:46:32,438 --> 01:46:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases there.

[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo Switch this week, we have Macross Shooting Insight comes out in both, of course, a regular and limited edition because that's how many games are done in Japan.

1244
01:46:44,107 --> 01:46:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, that is the only release on the Nintendo Switch this week.

1245
01:46:47,849 --> 01:46:51,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That same game is released on the PlayStation 5.

1252
01:47:27,795 --> 01:47:29,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And the others are on the 15th.

[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1258
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:50,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, believe it or not, we had no more long form stories scheduled for tonight.

1259
01:47:50,811 --> 01:47:56,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we'd talk about some other stuff after the release dates, but I feel like the news was a little bit abbreviated this week.

1260
01:47:56,157 --> 01:47:57,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure why.

1261
01:47:57,499 --> 01:48:01,283
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time of year, we're not like in spring break season yet or anything, right?

1262
01:48:01,283 --> 01:48:04,427
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an odd kind of time of year, I suppose.

1263
01:48:04,427 --> 01:48:05,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not quite to the

1264
01:48:05,988 --> 01:48:12,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Anticipation of summer releases and things like that, but it is overall a relatively quiet week.

1265
01:48:12,412 --> 01:48:14,393
[SPEAKER_07]: We will open up, of course, the listener roundtable.

1266
01:48:14,393 --> 01:48:21,557
[SPEAKER_07]: If you would like to have any questions for us, you can go ahead and plop those in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1267
01:48:21,557 --> 01:48:24,038

01:48:24,038 --> 01:48:27,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us an email.

1269
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, excuse me, hiccup.

1270
01:48:28,981 --> 01:48:31,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I believe we don't have any this week, if I remember right.

1271
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:44,330
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is ready to fend off the spam bots with a big orange bat that will knock them senseless, so no spam please.

1272
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:48,093
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100mat says media is slow in general because of Oscar season.

1273
01:48:48,093 --> 01:48:53,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Serious question and I promise I'm not saying this to be that guy or whatever you want to say.

1274
01:48:53,258 --> 01:48:55,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Do people really care about the Oscars that much?

1275
01:48:55,720 --> 01:49:09,207
[SPEAKER_07]: like maybe it's just because I've had this obligation on Sunday nights and I just I play more games than I see movies I couldn't even tell you what's nominated this year Oppenheimer the movie that looked really weird with the girl from EZA

1276
01:49:10,965 --> 01:49:13,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Those movies were nominated, right?

1277
01:49:13,206 --> 01:49:16,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So did Barbie get a Best Picture nom?

1278
01:49:16,708 --> 01:49:22,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Barbie got nominated for a lot but not Greta Gerwig, which was unfortunate because she probably deserved one.

1279
01:49:22,171 --> 01:49:27,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right, I guess everyone on my Facebook list is talking about the Oscars.

1280
01:49:27,274 --> 01:49:27,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1281
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:57,359
[SPEAKER_07]: why though spoiler Oppenheimer one best picture I figured because that movie it was a Chris Nolan film right is new the Oscar loves his movies and most of most of the ones I've seen are pretty good like I'm not knocking on Chris Nolan so Barbie won one award did it okay won the song that doesn't surprise that's that song hit hard in that movie I didn't realize the context in the movie and I was like damn this hits hard so does that mean does um

1282
01:49:59,525 --> 01:50:00,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did Billy?

1283
01:50:00,446 --> 01:50:02,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, Def says guess which one?

1284
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:04,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot there were two nominated.

1285
01:50:04,349 --> 01:50:06,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it not the Billie Eilish song that won?

1286
01:50:06,871 --> 01:50:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Did the other one win?

1287
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:10,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That's surprising if so.

1288
01:50:10,673 --> 01:50:14,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was also like the Dua Lipa songs.

1289
01:50:14,236 --> 01:50:15,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Really a bop.

1290
01:50:15,237 --> 01:50:18,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So okay, Def says it was Billie Eilish.

1291
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1292
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1293
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:21,782
[SPEAKER_07]: But doesn't that didn't she win now back to back?

1294
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:24,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Because didn't she have?

1295
01:50:24,464 --> 01:50:26,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Did she have a Bond song last year?

1296
01:50:28,177 --> 01:50:28,237
[SPEAKER_07]: and

1297
01:50:59,539 --> 01:51:01,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Dammit.

1298
01:51:01,161 --> 01:51:06,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know very many Billie Eilish songs, I'll be honest.

1299
01:51:06,446 --> 01:51:10,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't talk shit about you on the internet.

1300
01:51:10,169 --> 01:51:12,331
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that song that Kelly Clarkson covered?

1301
01:51:12,331 --> 01:51:14,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so good.

1302
01:51:14,393 --> 01:51:15,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Happier Than Ever.

1303
01:51:15,174 --> 01:51:16,435
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1304
01:51:16,435 --> 01:51:18,597
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one.

1305
01:51:18,597 --> 01:51:21,099
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I'm talking like I'm my age now.

1306
01:51:21,099 --> 01:51:23,181
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that one thing?

1307
01:51:23,181 --> 01:51:23,241
[SPEAKER_06]: But

1308
01:51:24,827 --> 01:51:25,307
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1309
01:51:25,307 --> 01:51:27,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that did the stuff.

1310
01:51:27,329 --> 01:51:28,049
[SPEAKER_06]: What's her name?

1311
01:51:28,049 --> 01:51:29,590
[SPEAKER_06]: That William Eyelash.

1312
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:31,931
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just.

1313
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:35,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It's William Eyelash.

1314
01:51:35,113 --> 01:51:36,814
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1315
01:51:36,814 --> 01:51:45,179
[SPEAKER_07]: But but look, it's because, look, I think you kind of choose the art that you consume, you know, and video games are the art that I consume.

1316
01:51:45,179 --> 01:51:47,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I can talk a lot about video games.

1317
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It means I can't.

1318
01:51:48,501 --> 01:51:51,963
[SPEAKER_07]: But I there's still not enough time to play every video game either.

1319
01:51:51,963 --> 01:51:53,444
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

1320
01:51:55,294 --> 01:51:58,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I found another Toriyama game just randomly.

1321
01:51:58,256 --> 01:51:59,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what's that?

1322
01:51:59,898 --> 01:52:03,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Gogo Ackman.

1323
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:08,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I should also open up the discord as well over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you'd like to give us a call.

1324
01:52:08,164 --> 01:52:10,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Podculture says Rob your boomer is showing.

1325
01:52:10,385 --> 01:52:12,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a fucking boomer.

1326
01:52:12,007 --> 01:52:15,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a I'm a late Gen X. There's a difference.

1327
01:52:15,429 --> 01:52:18,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Gen X is where all the Karens come from for whatever reason.

1328
01:52:20,089 --> 01:52:35,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, I don't know, because I believe it's all arbitrary anyway, but they were supposed to have, like, repartitioned what Gen X, what all of those things, like,

1329
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:42,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, because I think you and I are like in the group that's considered cusp Gen X. Yeah.

1330
01:52:42,777 --> 01:52:43,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I don't know.

1331
01:52:43,718 --> 01:52:46,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Zillennial was that name they were thrown around for a while.

1332
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Zenial.

1333
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Zenial or that.

1334
01:52:47,461 --> 01:52:47,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1335
01:52:47,681 --> 01:52:50,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the name I really liked, I didn't like that name.

1336
01:52:50,203 --> 01:52:54,006
[SPEAKER_07]: The name I really liked was there was a publication that called it the Oregon Trail Generation.

1337
01:52:54,006 --> 01:52:55,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yes, that is it.

1338
01:52:55,727 --> 01:52:58,329
[SPEAKER_07]: That is that is the name of this generation.

1339
01:52:58,329 --> 01:53:03,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And I identify with that harder than I do Gen X, to be honest.

1340
01:53:03,093 --> 01:53:05,575
[SPEAKER_09]: This is considered a micro generation.

1341
01:53:07,389 --> 01:53:14,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the micro generation of people on the cusp of Gen X and millennial demographic cohorts.

1342
01:53:14,574 --> 01:53:23,860
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, and I've seen anywhere between like 1995 through 84 or something like that.

1343
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:26,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've seen them even tighter than that.

1344
01:53:26,522 --> 01:53:28,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, whatever X is cooler.

1345
01:53:28,964 --> 01:53:33,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I saw something that was like 76 through 85 or something like that as like the Oregon Trail generation.

1346
01:53:35,355 --> 01:53:37,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Either way, I'd fall into it, and I'm like, whatever.

1347
01:53:37,737 --> 01:53:41,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for making up a word we don't need.

1348
01:53:41,019 --> 01:53:54,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Best name because, of course, we're not talking about the actual Oregon Trail, but of course, we are talking about the computer game that many of us played in the computer lab at school during the day and how we learned to use computers.

1349
01:53:54,607 --> 01:53:58,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1350
01:53:58,109 --> 01:54:01,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think it's like I tell people sometimes is that

1351
01:54:02,592 --> 01:54:09,698
[SPEAKER_09]: We had it where we did grow up with the technology as it was growing up.

1352
01:54:09,698 --> 01:54:21,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I was, I mean, without going into too much detail, I was born like right when the first Apple computer was released, like I think the year after.

1353
01:54:23,343 --> 01:54:27,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, when Star Wars was released, I was nine months old.

1354
01:54:27,904 --> 01:54:28,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1355
01:54:28,424 --> 01:54:40,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of all of this, you know, technology, we were on that cusp of playing outside and then coming in and playing with our NES.

1356
01:54:40,546 --> 01:54:43,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember getting extra cool because we did it all.

1357
01:54:43,867 --> 01:54:46,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember getting taken to the cheap theater to see.

1358
01:54:46,587 --> 01:54:49,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Return of the Jedi.

1359
01:54:50,287 --> 01:54:55,190
[SPEAKER_07]: but I vividly remember seeing Return to Oz as a child on the big screen and let me tell you the trauma

1360
01:55:13,894 --> 01:55:15,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember reading a book before I saw the movie.

1361
01:55:15,797 --> 01:55:18,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I read more books as a kid than I do now.

1362
01:55:32,032 --> 01:55:33,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the novelization of Spaceballs

1363
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:55,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And I may still have it somewhere in this house.

1364
01:55:55,851 --> 01:56:03,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun dumb fact, the novelization of Clue the movie is how they know that there was a fourth ending that was deleted and what it was.

1365
01:56:03,574 --> 01:56:09,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've confirmed all these years later they did shoot it and the director threw it in the trash because he said it was terrible.

1366
01:56:10,444 --> 01:56:16,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So, because it was, I, the fourth ending of the Clue movie was literally the butler did it.

1367
01:56:16,805 --> 01:56:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And he, it goes to this weird thing about he poisoned everybody's drink and now he's in the car, but it's, it's, it's a callback.

1368
01:56:23,667 --> 01:56:30,488
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a comedy callback to the dogs in the very, very, very beginning of the movie, because the dogs end up in the car with him and they growl.

1369
01:56:30,488 --> 01:56:31,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how it ends.

1370
01:56:31,968 --> 01:56:33,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it sounds trashy.

1371
01:56:33,309 --> 01:56:34,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those things.

1372
01:56:34,309 --> 01:56:34,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1373
01:56:34,749 --> 01:56:35,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1374
01:56:35,029 --> 01:56:39,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Better for movie trivia.

1375
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1376
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:48,153
[SPEAKER_09]: But I even remember, like, because I hadn't seen Alien right when it first came out because I was really too little for that.

1377
01:56:49,142 --> 01:57:01,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, I remember having the novelization for it and then watching the movie going, I thought that she found them turning into pods or something.

1378
01:57:01,972 --> 01:57:09,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And later on it turned out that, yeah, it was a deleted scene and they added in a recut version for the director's cut of Alien.

1379
01:57:09,538 --> 01:57:15,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they went, cause it was, I think that's where they came up with the queen concept for Aliens.

1380
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:31,779
[SPEAKER_09]: because that scene didn't end up in the final movie and now they've actually done like this whole how adaptable they are that if there's no queen, they will have people mutate into pods themselves to grow a queen.

1381
01:57:33,188 --> 01:57:35,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like novelizations of films were a huge thing.

1382
01:57:35,389 --> 01:57:40,012
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd find them all the time at the grocery store in the magazines and stuff.

1383
01:57:40,012 --> 01:57:43,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like I don't know if it's still as big of a thing as it used to be.

1384
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:49,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, remember, okay, so we can tie it to video games, because remember, then they kind of tried to do that with video games for a hot minute.

1385
01:57:49,418 --> 01:57:51,439
[SPEAKER_07]: There was that whole Worlds of Power, right?

1386
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:58,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the FX9 books with Simon's Quest with Blaster Master, you know, there was there and those books

1387
01:57:59,502 --> 01:58:03,424
[SPEAKER_07]: When you were 12 years old were the coolest fucking things.

1388
01:58:03,424 --> 01:58:09,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though you go back and you look at the plot now, it's like Simon Belmont had like a kid helper.

1389
01:58:09,026 --> 01:58:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really... I don't know the coolest.

1390
01:58:11,147 --> 01:58:15,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the plots have aged very well, but when you were 12, they were awesome.

1391
01:58:15,688 --> 01:58:20,150
[SPEAKER_01]: The coolest things were just getting all the cheap books at the Scholastic Book Fairs.

1392
01:58:20,150 --> 01:58:21,351
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the coolest thing.

1393
01:58:21,351 --> 01:58:22,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

1394
01:58:23,504 --> 01:58:39,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I still to this day remember my favorite like I never I usually read like quote grown-up books that I wasn't supposed to read but I picked up a more age-appropriate book that was called Serendipity.

1395
01:58:40,515 --> 01:58:49,057
[SPEAKER_09]: about a girl who was like a princess who daydreams and all this other things and rescues a unicorn and blah, blah, blah.

1396
01:58:49,057 --> 01:58:55,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turns out that she's just a real girl having a daydream with her horse.

1397
01:58:55,338 --> 01:59:02,119
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, but it was a cute little story and I kind of wish I could find another copy of it.

1398
01:59:02,119 --> 01:59:02,699
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1399
01:59:02,699 --> 01:59:04,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we don't have emails.

1400
01:59:04,379 --> 01:59:05,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see anybody in the green room.

1401
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me check in with Matt and see if we had any last minute stories tonight.

1402
01:59:10,873 --> 01:59:30,930
[SPEAKER_07]: uh i don't necessarily i was just looking at this free um homebrew snes game called dotty flowers it looks sweet sorry this comment gets me too phoenix7726 says also animorphs just saying that shit held up well and is even more fucked up we didn't have those i yeah i feel like

1403
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:33,331
[SPEAKER_07]: We missed that a little bit.

1404
01:59:33,331 --> 01:59:35,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that was starting to get big when I was in high school.

1405
01:59:35,531 --> 01:59:38,813
[SPEAKER_07]: But I remember the Babysitter's Club was a big thing.

1406
01:59:38,813 --> 01:59:40,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I also remember what were the- Yeah!

1407
01:59:40,994 --> 01:59:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: What were the horror- was it Fear Street?

1408
01:59:43,354 --> 01:59:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like there was another one in that.

1409
01:59:45,775 --> 01:59:46,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it was Fear Street.

1410
01:59:46,716 --> 01:59:50,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that was- Fear Street was the Goosebumps thing.

1411
01:59:50,397 --> 01:59:51,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Goosebumps.

1412
01:59:51,377 --> 01:59:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: That was everywhere too.

1413
01:59:54,785 --> 01:59:58,767
[SPEAKER_09]: We had scary stories in the dark.

1414
01:59:58,767 --> 02:00:03,829
[SPEAKER_09]: There were these black and white covers because we didn't have goosebumps either.

1415
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:10,933
[SPEAKER_09]: But we had the scary stories to tell in the dark that were like these black and white covers with like a red splash somewhere.

1416
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:17,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Animorphs, the thing, but I do want to point out, Animorphs is awesome.

1417
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:22,016
[SPEAKER_07]: The author is a very likable person and has come out in support of very good things.

1418
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:27,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's no shame in still loving the Animorphs as an adult.

1419
02:00:27,663 --> 02:00:29,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was around high school when those started to take off.

1420
02:00:31,027 --> 02:00:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys

1421
02:00:49,085 --> 02:00:49,586
[SPEAKER_07]: but I actually

1422
02:01:05,669 --> 02:01:30,881
[SPEAKER_09]: went back and read and purchased two Nancy Drew books that I loved when I was a young teenager and one of them is like this murder mystery thing where she like goes to an opera like she sings in an opera in disguise and that's all I had remembered about it for the longest time and then I had like the team up with Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys

1423
02:01:32,987 --> 02:01:34,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, those are the days.

1424
02:01:34,508 --> 02:01:39,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I would say the stuff- Sweet Valley High.

1425
02:01:39,032 --> 02:01:40,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Sweet Valley High.

1426
02:01:40,033 --> 02:01:40,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1427
02:01:40,473 --> 02:01:45,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say the stuff too I vividly remember as a kid would be the Ramona Quimby books.

1428
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:54,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Beverly Clearly and her whole thing, which she passed away at like the age of 100 relatively recently.

1429
02:01:54,363 --> 02:01:55,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Judy Blume books.

1430
02:01:55,863 --> 02:01:56,363
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1431
02:01:56,363 --> 02:01:58,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Judy Blume, Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.

1432
02:01:58,764 --> 02:02:00,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I even remember being 11.

1433
02:02:00,124 --> 02:02:03,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a book after Superfudge that I never read and I need to find it.

1434
02:02:03,966 --> 02:02:08,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember reading Are You There, God, It's Me, Margaret when I was 11 years old.

1435
02:02:08,627 --> 02:02:09,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a lot of questions.

1436
02:02:09,748 --> 02:02:11,188
[SPEAKER_07]: How to Eat Fried Worms.

1437
02:02:11,188 --> 02:02:13,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know that she tried to make a male version of that book?

1438
02:02:15,103 --> 02:02:15,163
[SPEAKER_09]: and

1439
02:02:46,055 --> 02:02:52,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked all of the ones um there was another one that had Margaret in the lead though wasn't it

1440
02:03:06,478 --> 02:03:10,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, did she do one later where she came back to like Margaret as an adult or something?

1441
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:10,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

1442
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:11,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that would have been a thing.

1443
02:03:11,561 --> 02:03:12,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

1444
02:03:12,121 --> 02:03:14,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought for sure there was another one.

1445
02:03:14,402 --> 02:03:16,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then she got into adult books later on.

1446
02:03:16,883 --> 02:03:23,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think she has written a young adult or a child book in quite some time, to be honest.

1447
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:24,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to read.

1448
02:03:24,066 --> 02:03:29,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll find the name of that one that's after Superfudge.

1449
02:03:29,889 --> 02:03:32,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Frecklejuice was another one.

1450
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:33,511
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Doublefudge.

1451
02:03:34,864 --> 02:03:36,285
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was it, Double Fudge.

1452
02:03:36,285 --> 02:03:44,308
[SPEAKER_07]: There were five books in the Fudge series because there was Super Fudge, Fudgemania and Double Fudge.

1453
02:03:44,308 --> 02:03:44,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't.

1454
02:03:44,909 --> 02:03:52,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't read the I think the because I read Tales of Fourth Grade and I think I read Super Fudge, but I didn't read anything other than that.

1455
02:03:52,292 --> 02:03:53,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1456
02:03:53,432 --> 02:03:58,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So and then also, I did not know if they turned Fudge into a TV series at some point.

1457
02:03:58,435 --> 02:03:58,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that.

1458
02:03:59,557 --> 02:04:00,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they did.

1459
02:04:00,898 --> 02:04:03,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow, Doublefoot came out in 2002?

1460
02:04:03,781 --> 02:04:04,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you there God?

1461
02:04:04,702 --> 02:04:05,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me, Margaret.

1462
02:04:05,963 --> 02:04:07,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally got turned into a film.

1463
02:04:07,444 --> 02:04:08,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally.

1464
02:04:08,485 --> 02:04:09,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year.

1465
02:04:09,306 --> 02:04:12,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know they did a movie version of that like last year?

1466
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:20,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that kind of like... Yeah, I know that they did, but I never saw it.

1467
02:04:22,242 --> 02:04:24,643
[SPEAKER_07]: OddCulture says Encyclopedia Brown.

1468
02:04:24,643 --> 02:04:25,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember that.

1469
02:04:25,783 --> 02:04:26,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember something.

1470
02:04:26,604 --> 02:04:33,586
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the one she would close her eyes and say click and she had a photographic memory and she could remember things and it helped her?

1471
02:04:33,586 --> 02:04:36,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this is... Oh, I remember from the mixed up files of Ms.

1472
02:04:36,928 --> 02:04:40,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Basil E. Frankweiler.

1473
02:04:40,109 --> 02:04:42,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the two kids run away from home to live in the Met.

1474
02:04:43,513 --> 02:05:07,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, which Okay, to bring it back and to close it out on a video game topic since we are you know, supposedly a video game show, which of these young adult reminiscing seer which of these young adult books would make the best video game which which book from your youth would make the best video game?

1475
02:05:07,697 --> 02:05:09,857
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a hard one.

1476
02:05:09,857 --> 02:05:10,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1477
02:05:10,718 --> 02:05:12,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1478
02:05:12,718 --> 02:05:12,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

1479
02:05:15,731 --> 02:05:18,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really think of a ton.

1480
02:05:18,172 --> 02:05:24,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, um, uh, Bunnicula.

1481
02:05:24,435 --> 02:05:26,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1482
02:05:26,556 --> 02:05:27,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix says Animorphs.

1483
02:05:27,796 --> 02:05:29,837
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a, that's a pretty good, some of them.

1484
02:05:29,837 --> 02:05:31,098
[SPEAKER_07]: There's already Animorph games.

1485
02:05:31,098 --> 02:05:31,938
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't count.

1486
02:05:31,938 --> 02:05:34,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just, well, also like I would say, oh, Nancy Drew.

1487
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:34,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, duh.

1488
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:42,063
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a whole series of games that she's been in, but you know, those types of like crime solving games, I think would be very, very good.

1489
02:05:42,063 --> 02:05:42,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1490
02:05:44,915 --> 02:05:46,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe something.

1491
02:05:46,695 --> 02:05:52,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein for no particular reason.

1492
02:05:52,236 --> 02:05:52,936
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my answer.

1493
02:05:52,936 --> 02:05:55,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sticking to it.

1494
02:05:55,197 --> 02:05:56,837
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1495
02:05:56,837 --> 02:05:57,677
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1496
02:05:57,677 --> 02:05:58,517
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to wrap up.

1497
02:05:58,517 --> 02:06:00,158
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of here for the night.

1498
02:06:00,158 --> 02:06:03,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week.

1499
02:06:03,758 --> 02:06:04,519
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1500
02:06:04,519 --> 02:06:05,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a thought.

1501
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:05,759
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

1502
02:06:05,759 --> 02:06:12,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Silverstein, what if they did like a visual novel version of A Boy Named Sue?

1503
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:12,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1504
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:20,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And your purpose is to go around and beat people up to find out where your dad is so you can kick his ass.

1505
02:06:20,822 --> 02:06:22,543
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're gonna wrap up though.

1506
02:06:22,543 --> 02:06:23,223
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.

1507
02:06:23,223 --> 02:06:23,983
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of here.

1508
02:06:23,983 --> 02:06:25,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you as always for listening to Orange Zaunage Radio.

1509
02:06:25,784 --> 02:06:29,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for listening to us, whether it was on the podcast feed or live.

1510
02:06:29,385 --> 02:06:31,406
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate you all being here.

1511
02:06:31,406 --> 02:06:32,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us spread the word.

1512
02:06:32,446 --> 02:06:35,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1513
02:06:35,687 --> 02:06:37,248
[SPEAKER_07]: We need more voices to put out here on air.

1514
02:06:37,688 --> 02:06:39,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode 1000 is around the corner.

1515
02:06:39,249 --> 02:06:41,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really good excuse to get new people to come in.

1516
02:06:41,211 --> 02:06:42,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So we appreciate it.

1517
02:06:42,692 --> 02:06:47,015
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice five star review on iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you found the show goes a long way.

1518
02:06:47,015 --> 02:06:53,859
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, somebody left a Spotify note this last week that just said woke and gay.

1519
02:06:53,859 --> 02:06:55,340
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember last week's show.

1520
02:06:56,397 --> 02:06:57,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course I approved it.

1521
02:06:57,537 --> 02:06:59,358
[SPEAKER_07]: We are woke and gay.

1522
02:06:59,358 --> 02:07:01,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, so they, they, sure.

1523
02:07:01,998 --> 02:07:05,699
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to leave that fine, I don't care as long as it has five stars by it.

1524
02:07:05,699 --> 02:07:08,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and it's, it's funny and it makes sense.

1525
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:11,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but anyway, in all seriousness, thank you for supporting.

1526
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:12,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.

1527
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:13,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we'll be back to do it all again in seven days.

1528
02:07:13,861 --> 02:07:15,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1529
02:07:15,441 --> 02:07:18,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe DarkSakura, you said you were not streaming tonight.

1530
02:07:18,262 --> 02:07:22,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, sorry kids, but we'll raid somebody else in a moment here.

1531
02:07:24,743 --> 02:07:34,766
[SPEAKER_09]: To speak for myself on this, I have my other toenail done, and I have a back sprain that I'm still healing from.

1532
02:07:34,766 --> 02:07:42,768
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I intend to be on medications, which does not make, I mean, it might make for interesting gameplay, but certainly not for Dead by Daylight.

1533
02:07:42,768 --> 02:07:48,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be like, ooh, I'm gonna make friends with the, I'm dead.

1534
02:07:48,129 --> 02:07:48,489
So, yeah.

1535
02:07:51,547 --> 02:07:52,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it away, David.

1536
02:07:52,328 --> 02:07:53,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

1537
02:07:53,228 --> 02:07:54,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play on Tuesday.

1538
02:07:54,289 --> 02:07:56,691
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1539
02:07:56,691 --> 02:07:59,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, I see what you linked there in chat.

1540
02:07:59,172 --> 02:08:00,273
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your merch store.

1541
02:08:00,273 --> 02:08:01,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you want to plug?

1542
02:08:01,194 --> 02:08:01,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.

1543
02:08:01,854 --> 02:08:05,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to plug the merch store that I've got now.

1544
02:08:05,437 --> 02:08:09,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So lokiolr.printify.me.

1545
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:12,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also linked in the Discord as well.

1546
02:08:12,242 --> 02:08:15,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Merch shirt.

1547
02:08:15,024 --> 02:08:15,344
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1548
02:08:16,223 --> 02:08:18,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Get him if you like him, don't if you don't.

1549
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:18,825
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

1550
02:08:18,825 --> 02:08:19,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care either way.

1551
02:08:19,945 --> 02:08:25,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sadly, no, no merch store for me to plug here, but I will plug.

1552
02:08:25,389 --> 02:08:31,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you happen to be local in the Sacramento area, I am hosting an event at the Colonial on April 27th.

1553
02:08:31,693 --> 02:08:32,794
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a lot of fun.

1554
02:08:32,794 --> 02:08:35,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Burlesque, variety, all that good stuff.

1555
02:08:35,235 --> 02:08:37,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Tickets are available at lovehorrorevents.com.

1556
02:08:37,157 --> 02:08:38,978
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I will plug that for myself.

1557
02:08:38,978 --> 02:08:41,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So an in-person sighting, if you will.

1558
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,982
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am looking forward more to more in-person conventions and things like that.

1559
02:08:45,322 --> 02:08:46,604
