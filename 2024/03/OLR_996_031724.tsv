9682	13184	I still go to arcades, well, an arcade, because Round 1 exists near me.
13184	22749	Atari is hyping up bringing life back to arcades, partnered with Allen 1, their new cabinets are planned to integrate redemption, and local arcade competition featuring notifications to your phone if your high score has been toppled.
22749	25771	A nice addition if the arcade has good prizes and the game is worth playing.
25771	28613	I'm interested, but will try not to let my brain get ahead of reality.
28613	37358	Give life back to arcades, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somers, and Loki to tell you more about their story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39059	41841	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
41841	46425	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46425	54432	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 996 of our show for tonight, March the 17th of 2024.
59509	60069	Happy St.
60069	67533	Patrick's Day to those of you out there that celebrate it or as some people call it happy straight pride because that's also what today is for some people.
67533	70314	Y'all asked, y'all asked when straight pride?
70314	71114	Here you go.
71114	71834	It's today.
71834	73415	Congratulations.
73415	75056	Have fun.
75056	75856	Don't drink and drive.
75856	76496	All right.
76496	84760	Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts and I'm here joining you every week with my co host say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
86005	88790	So there's actually a tradition that not a lot of people know about for St.
88790	95881	Patrick's Day.
95881	97583	If you are Catholic, you wear green.
97583	99126	If you are Protestant, you wear orange.
100373	101834	Oh, really?
101834	104975	Are we Protestant lounge radio then tonight or what?
104975	106976	This bitch is Goth and Jewish as fuck.
106976	108316	I'm wearing black.
108316	111177	I was like, I'm not wearing any green today.
111177	115299	In fact, I'm actually wearing one of the old VOG Network shirts because I love this jersey.
115299	118460	Just ask yourself, would Dolores do it?
118460	122222	Well, what I'm asking myself is maybe I want to be pinched.
122222	124343	Have you all ever thought about that?
124343	126944	Anyway, I'd be like, would Dolores do it?
127810	128711	Hi Loki, how are you?
149003	149563	Pretty good.
149563	163190	I love your throwback video tonight because of course we do tape live every Sunday night, holiday or not, at the Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network VOG Network at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
163190	172374	And if you are watching us live, sometimes we have cute little things going on in the background like DarkSakura exists as a cartoon character in Super Metroid.
172374	174075	She is the last Metroid.
174895	176956	in captivity live during the show.
176956	178616	Bullshit on in captivity.
178616	181557	But I'm letting those tentacles go free.
181557	186459	Loki likes to have some video game footage, of course, appropriately running behind him as we tape live.
186459	190120	And tonight is the one and only fantastic Super Mario RPG.
190120	191960	What what brought this to remake?
191960	195421	Oh, this is because I've run out of games.
195421	196262	You know what's sad?
196262	199363	I still have not gotten around to the remake still.
199363	201984	It's a technicality because I haven't done this one yet.
201984	203024	OK, fair enough.
203024	203324	All good.
204515	207277	Well, anyway, I hope everybody out there is doing fantastic.
207277	210240	Thank you as always for being here for us taping our show.
210240	214083	Yeah, we are only four episodes away from episode 1000.
214083	215624	I don't want to set the bar too high.
215624	223190	We do not have some stunt AAA guest or excuse me, quadruple A guest on the show or anything like that coming.
223190	224891	We're not we're not that kind of operation.
225391	225872	Thanks for tuning in.
250495	268305	We're still doing what we do here every week as we've done it since 2002, talking about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, with the occasional tangent train, just the occasional spare usage of a tangent train that goes somewhere completely fucking different.
268305	270326	So anyway, we'll see what happens tonight.
270326	272087	But let's get into some gaming news.
272087	275288	And we're going to start off with Loki kicking us off tonight.
275288	276049	I got to say, though,
276849	304961	this is I'm just gonna be be real I don't think this would have been the kickoff topic any other week the news the news feels very I don't as it has been for the last couple weeks it feels very sparse I don't know what's up with that I don't feel like this time of year is very light on video game news but I feel and it's not to say there isn't anything going on because of course we still have a bunch of things to talk about but I don't feel like we've been getting big announcements and maybe that was all of us anticipating a Switch successor getting announced by now because
305697	308419	you know, hypothetically, that should have been announced by now.
308419	313241	But you know, we've all heard the rumors about the 2025 delay, which seems more and more likely at this point.
313241	316563	So I don't know, did everybody else move their stuff to?
316563	322747	But this this time of year is feeling very barren when it comes to a lot of the big, big headlines.
322747	332232	But that's not to say there aren't things making headlines, including one of the big announcement shows we can expect in a few months, right, Loki?
332987	333407	Right.
333407	333767	Yeah.
333767	347991	So basically, Jeff Keighley is in the spotlight right now just because of people were expecting him to make a comment about all the different, you know, layoffs that have been going on in the industry.
347991	352652	They were hoping, I think, that that would happen during the Game Awards.
352652	357954	But I could understand why that didn't because of, you know, the game companies
359291	386448	involvement with the Game Awards but in the case he's made a comment three months later I guess saying you know hey it's a heartbreaking time in the gaming industry with layoffs impacting developers who bring us joy so I wanted to signal boost Amir Savat and he's built a directory of 6,800 plus job candidates 2,100 mentors and even mock interview matchmaking
387376	391018	and a link to the website.
391018	391579	Great.
391579	394721	Glad you're doing that now.
394721	401385	But, you know, I think folks are hoping that he would make more of a statement about it earlier on.
401385	403726	I just don't know what really one person can do.
403726	404507	Exactly.
404507	406848	I'm not sure what the expectation was.
406848	412912	Well, I can say this because I want to be fair, too, is that, you know, I don't want to make it sound like, oh, he can't do anything.
412912	414333	He is in a tricky position, though.
414753	417355	He is right now, he's the gaming industry's hype person, right?
417355	419397	He's big time, the gaming industry's hype person.
419397	429304	And in order to be able to do that successfully and get the announcements, he can't like go around burning all his bridges and say like, oh man, EA fucked up and now has to lay off these people.
429304	442734	That sucks for EA because that the realistic, whether you like it or not, the realistic answer to that is that then that maybe potentially makes EA more hesitant to work with him because he might say something crappy.
443214	446055	So I understand people's frustrations.
446055	451076	I do like what he did, elevating a resource for people seeking jobs.
451076	453497	And I do feel like he could have done that sooner.
453497	456077	Like he didn't have to talk bad about the industry.
456077	459698	He could have elevated these types of resources sooner.
459698	465500	That part I will agree with, but I'm not sure otherwise what people realistically expected him to do.
465500	467300	He can't call out companies.
468547	470352	He's not in a position to be able to do that.
470352	472960	But yes, he should have been elevating these sorts of things sooner.
472960	474866	He has to play that political game.
474866	475046	Yeah.
476175	499152	Certainly, and I'm not sure if necessarily he's, you know, made any sort of comments kind of like, you know, you can still make comments about the situation without, like, outright saying, you know, well, game companies, you got to do better, you know, like, he could have been like, hey, I'm disappointed to see all these layoffs going on in the industry, you know, type of thing.
499372	501053	Well, you could have said that, I guess.
501053	501513	Yeah.
501513	502273	And he did.
502273	522542	He did say, and I think part of what kind of set the expectation for that was the year at the Game Awards where he opened it up condemning, you know, a lot of the bullshit that was going on in the industry at the time with, you know, anti-minority stuff and, you know, the horrible culture that people like Bobby Kotick were enabling when they were at the heads of the companies and stuff.
522542	522742	Right.
523502	525143	He did come out and speak out against that.
525143	531326	And I think ever since then, there's been an expectation, oh, he's going to open the Game Awards every year, speaking out against something.
531326	541930	But that's not really like, again, I think it also just goes to show how important that message was to do that particular year.
541930	544552	And that's not to say these other messages aren't important.
544552	549494	But at the same time, he can't start off the Game Awards every single year with a downer.
550234	552756	or else people are going to be less likely to work with him.
552756	555898	And that's that's again, as DarkSakura used the word political.
555898	556959	That's what it is.
556959	559821	It sucks, but it's what it is.
559821	566886	He also did announce a day later that Summer Games Fest is going to be coming this year, June 7th at 2 p.m.
566886	568047	Pacific, 5 p.m.
568047	569347	Eastern.
569347	577853	And also that live tickets are available if you want to see that live in person at the I believe it's
579011	580612	YouTube Theater in Los Angeles
598397	623147	the name just won't stick that reminds me of y'all y'all have heard me rant about Arco Arena on this show right our local sports stadium or former sports it is now a pile of rubble forever in our hearts Arco Arena the beam from the Sacramento Kings comes from a brand new arena that's downtown but you know you always hear me talk about Arco Arena so at some point and that place was called Arco Arena which Arco was a big gas station thing if you didn't know for the last like for like 20 years
623687	630911	And then one day, they decided to change the naming rights to, um, what was it?
630911	637354	Uh, Power Balance Pavilion, which is the stupidest name I've ever heard because, you know what, do you remember what Power Balance was?
639048	639628	issues.
639628	641088	It was those fucking bracelets.
641088	644629	You remember the bracelets that were supposed to like bring you?
644629	646370	I don't I don't know what the fuck I was supposed to do.
646370	648230	But they were obviously all a rip off.
648230	654271	And somehow that company sponsored the fucking sports arena, which shows you how broke the Kings were at the time.
654271	660153	So there was that and then then it was sleep train for a hot minute until mattress firm bought them and the thing.
660153	661973	So that's that place kept changing names too.
661973	665614	And I was like, they're never gonna call this anything but Arcorita ever.
667715	673759	Bob Coffey is pointing out that the Microsoft Theater is now the Peacock Theater.
673759	677602	Ah, I thought that was now the YouTube Theater, that same one.
677602	679143	Okay, so I'm being corrected.
679143	682646	The YouTube Theater is near the Ram Stadium in Inglewood.
683306	684227	My bad.
684227	685368	So it isn't.
685368	687370	And do you know why I assumed that?
687370	691594	Because that would have been the location that was prime spot for E3, right?
691594	696618	That was the LA Live that they had built just next door basically to the convention center.
696618	700222	So I made that assumption that it was there because that's where E3 had always been.
700222	701142	But I suppose
702367	710049	Now that there's no beholdenness to E3, they can get a cheaper venue out in Inglewood, I guess.
710049	712689	So maybe with better parking.
712689	713149	But I don't know.
713149	714469	I don't know the situation down there.
714469	717050	So and I doubt I'll be able to go to this.
717050	717650	So.
717650	718750	The OUYA Theater?
718750	719350	What?
719350	721831	The OUYA Theater.
721831	724211	The Phantom Theater.
724211	725652	The N-Gage Theater presents.
728522	730544	Nokia presents the N-Gage theater.
730544	735888	That's where this show is broadcast live from the N-Gage studio.
735888	736228	Anyway.
736228	739691	Yeah.
739691	743755	Well, that's I mean, Summer Game Fest should be interesting this year.
743755	749239	I feel like there's a lot of holiday things we really have no inclination about at this point.
749239	752021	I feel like we're going to get a lot of interesting surprises.
752021	755404	And the fact that there is no more of this like E3's
757486	762488	Spectre roaming around like a weekend at Bernie's.
762488	767289	E3 Bernie is not roaming around placing the shadow on the thing.
767289	775392	What I mean by that is that I think there's going to be a lot of companies that time big announcements with Summer Game Fest as kind of used to be done with E3.
775392	779693	So I kind of expect, and I don't want to set the bar too high, but I sort of expect the Summer Game Fest
780825	792309	It already had some decently sized announcements, but I think it's going to get way bigger this year without any sort of E3 formal thing or figment of imagination.
792309	798952	That's not to say we will likely we will probably also have a Microsoft event around that time.
798952	803874	We will probably have a Sony event and a Nintendo Direct around that time.
804594	808836	But I just I feel like we're gonna get a lot bigger announcements out of Summer Game Fest than we usually get.
808836	810237	So this will be very interesting.
810237	814539	And what's what's also interesting about this is there's no awards.
814539	828745	So we don't have to worry about this whole thing where people are always like, why do they they cut the runtime on the speeches and they do all this there's there's no awards to distract from the game announcements, which and don't get me wrong.
828745	830646	I love the game awards.
831266	835048	But how many of you that were complaining about that tuned into the DICE Awards?
835048	844291	I can tell you, not nearly as many, because there weren't as many people live on Twitch watching the DICE Awards as there were the Game Awards.
844291	845612	But I digress.
845612	848533	So Summer Game Fest is, you know, all the announcement stuff.
849815	852276	without having to compete with the awards thing.
852276	853837	So it'll be interesting.
853837	857019	If Kojima takes a 15-minute segment, then so be it.
857019	863923	Though I would think, interestingly enough, as a backlash to the last thing, I think Kojima's presence will be minimal.
863923	867685	I think there'll be maybe an update trailer or something, maybe like a Death Stranding 2.
867685	869547	Another Death Stranding 2 trailer?
869547	870867	Oh joy!
870867	871708	Release date, maybe?
872864	873164	Trailer
894361	897163	And every time they teased it, they had to show something new.
897163	902445	And then it ended up being these half-baked conceptual ideas that weren't ready yet.
902445	904746	Now, obviously, the game is in a much different place now.
904746	905527	We all know that.
905527	910029	And the things that they promised originally, they've now delivered on all this time later.
910029	916052	But at the time, it was a disaster express, and it was too much hype.
916052	916992	Hurt the game.
916992	921915	And I think that's something I feel like the industry still hasn't figured out, is that too much
923109	924590	Thank you all so much for watching!
940223	942404	Oh, my game's not profitable.
942404	949006	Oh, I, you know, with AAA or AAAA, you know, we're spending so much money on this.
949006	955648	Well, maybe advertise it a whole hell lot less four years in advance of it coming out.
955648	956508	How about that?
956508	956828	Yeah.
956828	964831	Like, does it matter that I'm hyped up for Death Stranding 2 now if it doesn't come out until like the end of the next year or something like that?
964831	966131	No, it doesn't matter.
966131	966311	Like,
967625	969046	who cares?
969046	971407	Stop wasting money.
971407	973848	Anyway, so yeah, a lot of announcements.
973848	976309	Yeah, I feel like a lot of news maybe we'd be talking about now.
976309	978830	I guess we're gonna have to wait for Summer Game Fest to hear instead.
978830	980831	But yeah, so looking forward to it.
980831	990275	And it'll be interesting to see how Jeff Keighley kind of continues to navigate this fine line of don't piss off the industry, but also support the people working in the industry.
990275	990495	Right?
991434	993856	So, you know, he doesn't he doesn't have an easy job.
993856	995117	I don't envy him.
995117	998020	E3VL mentions Grand Theft Auto 6.
998020	999681	Maybe, you know, that's obviously huge.
999681	1007167	I mean, that's eventually coming out whenever, you know, eventually when it's when it's good and done and not a moment sooner.
1007167	1012832	Anyway, let's talk about the types of video games we've been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1012832	1014253	And DarkSakura, we'll go to you.
1014253	1014894	How was your gaming week?
1016488	1017328	It was alright.
1017328	1020289	It's been a busy week with training at work.
1020289	1023911	But I did play some Dead by Daylight with Fixie, and it was pretty fun.
1023911	1029593	I got the new DLC came out, so of course I adapted Sable.
1029593	1040257	And I probably am going to be working on the unknown tonight, the new killer, although I still refer to it as Nobody the Cheerleader.
1043418	1051261	Did you know that the voice actor for The Unknown is a transgender woman who is doing both the male and female roles?
1060692	1061472	as I was going to say.
1061472	1065053	Sorry.
1065053	1068955	But yeah, I think that that's really awesome.
1068955	1080819	And also, I think today I watched a video by MintSkull, who's someone I generally enjoy his videos, who really went off on the people who are being complete transphobes over this.
1080819	1084740	So fuck you if you were a transphobe, you know.
1085040	1091925	You know, there was a weird little bump in the road because she apparently took some issue with some things Behavior did.
1091925	1095768	I'm not going to go into detail because she ended up deleting whatever she had posted.
1095768	1096829	I have the post.
1096829	1098350	Yeah, but but I have a picture of it.
1098350	1099431	She asked for it to be pulled.
1099431	1100512	So I'm not going to repeat it.
1100512	1107897	So but there's even sounds to me like it was anything that completely about treatment.
1107897	1108778	Yeah.
1108778	1110960	It was more of a lack of information.
1110960	1111100	Yeah.
1113363	1118406	So she did the job she was supposed to do with the information that she was given.
1118406	1119087	Not her fault.
1119087	1120788	No problem at all.
1120788	1134055	And one thing that I've always thought, especially in more recent years, is that behavior has become a lot more inclusive in terms, although I would still like for them to have an official ace person other than someone just named Ace.
1136417	1143960	But anyway, going back to that, I played a lot of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora and there was a lot of cussing.
1143960	1152904	And last night I started the Japanese Dracula X turn in the moonlight for Sega Saturn.
1152904	1154365	I wanted to see that, but I was out last night.
1156158	1167507	Well, I played a little bit longer than intended and Dan was actually in the chat telling me which direction to go in and telling me to do double jumps when I hadn't gotten the gravity boots yet.
1169440	1175604	And although he did help me with the part that I was having a problem on with just this one thing is I had forgotten where the Jeweled Fist was.
1175604	1183810	So he helped me get through that and I absolutely love that game.
1183810	1186052	And as far as
1187970	1189752	I mean, I just love side quests, I guess.
1189752	1196958	I like going around and finding stuff and making my own fun and just kind of getting lost and immersed in the universe.
1196958	1202883	Like, I was finding every chair that I could sit in and, you know, doing poses and all kinds of stuff.
1203583	1207667	And also, that's kind of what I've been doing in Avatar as well, is I've just been running around.
1207667	1227943	I put the main game on hold so that I could go and do a bunch of side quests and get into the lore and learn a little bit about, like, my character's clan and, you know, try to bring people together because in the middle of doing so, I'm also getting her quite leveled up and having a fun time doing it.
1227943	1230606	So I was also
1233924	1243171	Wednesday years old when I found out that if you fly your Ikran through a swarm of insects, she'll eat them and regain stamina.
1243171	1244192	That's funny.
1244192	1246914	So that was kind of a fun thing.
1246914	1252678	And actually, my new favorite hobby is shooting down helicopters.
1252678	1253379	It's pretty fun.
1253379	1261084	You just aim for the little rotors because, you know, their helicopter things have their rotors on either side, kind of like weird wings.
1261084	1262926	And if you shoot them, they'll instaboom.
1264949	1269972	You can also throw mines at them and the mines will explode and also burn everybody inside and that's really fun too.
1269972	1272493	Are those the VTOLs from the first movie?
1272493	1275415	Yeah, the Samson.
1275415	1283399	VTOL, yeah, they're a VTOL, but, um, they, uh, like the double thing, helicopter, the Samson.
1283399	1284360	Oh, okay.
1284360	1285720	Whatever they call them.
1285720	1288662	Yeah, but, um, and they also have like huge carriers that's got...
1290076	1290436	All right.
1290436	1294458	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, we will head on over to Loki, your gaming week.
1319311	1335357	uh so i did play something other than minecraft it was mostly minecraft uh it was like it was like 99 99.9 percent minecrafted and one percent control freak uh so control freak the best way to describe it is it is a ncis
1336516	1338276	Hacking Sim.
1338276	1347678	So, you know, you know that that television show with the really poor portrayal of how hacking works.
1347678	1355680	It's essentially a game where you smash the keyboard as fast as you can to hack and you have to like.
1355680	1360001	Click on things and hack stuff and you can type in keywords and it does different things.
1360001	1365462	It's it's silly and stupid and great because it has all the you know, the
1366158	1366959	DarkSakura
1382267	1387272	ForeignChange, definitely worth checking out for just a silly little game.
1387272	1395940	And then Minecraft put out an episode this week, and then I've been just working on designing some more things, still working on the theme park thing.
1395940	1402326	The ride's gonna take a long time because I've actually had to have code written for it to get it to work.
1404904	1410448	I am still working on the design of it, but in the meantime I'm working on stuff in the base.
1410448	1417213	I've got a massive super spelter coming out in the next episode, which is ridiculously large and overpowered.
1417213	1423738	And we did a livestream weekend for Channel 64 yesterday, so that was fun.
1425404	1426385	Thanks for watching!
1442031	1447476	The reason it's taking so long is so... Well, first off, it's huge, and it's incredibly detailed.
1447476	1454843	Like, the type of detail that Disney would put into a Dark Ride, I am going through the same process to create this in Minecraft.
1454843	1461530	So it's... There's a lot of work that's involved with it, including, like, custom models, so it's 3D modeling.
1461530	1466855	There's custom code being written, because Minecraft boats suck, and they don't...
1467335	1468856	They don't turn with the water.
1468856	1471979	So I have to write something to do that for me.
1471979	1475081	You know, all that type of stuff.
1475081	1477323	But it's going to be amazing when it comes out.
1477323	1477703	All right.
1477703	1478324	Eventually.
1478324	1479725	Yeah.
1479725	1481847	Nice.
1481847	1482747	All right.
1482747	1489193	Oh, also, I wanted to mention, because I thought I saw you had crossed a milestone on your stream, right?
1489193	1489893	Didn't you cross?
1489893	1491214	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1491214	1492795	200,000 views or something?
1492795	1494097	Yeah, 200,000 views on my channel.
1494097	1494597	Congrats.
1494597	1495378	That's great.
1495378	1496138	Yeah, pretty good.
1496138	1496979	All right.
1497749	1500471	Um, let's see, uh, my gaming week.
1500471	1503253	So a lot of similar things I usually do.
1503253	1505795	Um, I play, you know, Final Fantasy XIV.
1505795	1507336	I was playing Diablo IV.
1507336	1516082	I actually played a lot more No Man's Sky because I was really, um, fixated on finishing this expedition, which I had until today.
1516082	1522407	So today was the deadline to finish the expedition before it's disabled and done, uh, and everything reverts to the general save.
1522407	1523588	I finished it yesterday.
1524008	1526149	So I finished it with hours to spare.
1526149	1532770	I had streamed a good chunk of my playthrough, but I did finish it off stream because I was playing at weird hours.
1532770	1535391	But I really enjoyed this expedition, No Man's Sky.
1535391	1545153	I actually think probably next to Expedition 2, which was the secret Mass Effect one, they didn't tell you when that expedition first came out that you would unlock the Normandy at the end.
1545153	1547614	There were hints, and it was one of those things where it really made sense.
1547614	1551395	And I really feel like the way they executed that was just the best.
1551395	1552875	Like, that was the best expedition they ever did.
1553335	1565301	Next to that, this one I actually think was probably the best expedition they've had because it was really a little bit of everything except, I would say, space combat.
1565301	1568363	It was like the one thing you didn't have to do in this expedition.
1568363	1576727	You did have to do ground combat, but they gave you a ridiculously overpowered weapon to help you through it.
1576727	1581250	Honestly, I barely took any damage doing it, and so I was really impressed.
1581770	1584692	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1603706	1615093	thing I don't get with No Man's Sky and maybe my feedback for Hello Games is I don't understand why these expeditions are so short lived, especially one that does such a good job that robustly like shows different features of the game.
1615093	1620537	This is a great catch up thing for a lot of people to be able to catch up on some of the things they've missed.
1620537	1627661	I mean, they they don't get into everything because again, like the the outposts that randomly spawn on planets and things like that.
1627661	1629162	They don't get into quite everything.
1629162	1631264	But even like the pirate galaxies are addressed.
1631764	1634988	How to make the red drive and the blue drive to get to different stars.
1634988	1638172	Like a lot of it really kind of lays it all out.
1638172	1639474	So I don't understand.
1639474	1647804	And maybe that would be a feature I'd like to see in No Man's Sky at some point, especially if they have the expeditions that are launchable from the hub now.
1647804	1650067	Why not play the expeditions at any time?
1650788	1657593	But I understand there's got to be a certain amount of, you know, the exclusiveness of the cosmetics.
1657593	1661637	If, you know, they're available at any time, then it makes it less attractive to do so.
1661637	1669142	I understand they kind of want to filter at a certain time and then help boost buzz and the streaming because they do the twitch drops and stuff.
1669142	1673085	So I do understand there's a certain amount of publicity tweaking that's coming into it as well.
1673085	1673226	But
1674221	1678046	especially with some of the old expeditions that were never available on Switch.
1678046	1679888	Just turn them on.
1679888	1682271	Just let people revisit them whenever they want.
1682271	1685235	You know, like they're years old at this point, especially if they're not coming back.
1685235	1685956	I don't know.
1685956	1689160	That's that's my take on it, or at least let these things run for a few months.
1689640	1699683	If unless now, if No Man's Sky puts out a patch tomorrow, which they darn well might like, at the rate they do things they very well might.
1699683	1707625	So if Hello Games puts out a patch for No Man's Sky tomorrow, then I'll be like, okay, that's why it was closed when they did, because they were about to launch something else.
1707625	1713907	But if that doesn't happen, I would have been like, why not just leave it open until you're ready to roll out the next patch, like six weeks is really not a lot of time.
1714287	1729945	all in all said and done anyway i'll stop harping on that because otherwise i loved um the multi-tool that you unlock from this expedition is a giant staff so now your character takes a big staff around it just looks awesome i just i i was really into it i i this game this game
1730706	1737014	keeps hitting new high points, which there's not a lot of video games where you can say that about, you know, years and years.
1737014	1740318	It's kind of got me psyched for the the next one.
1740318	1741059	It does.
1741059	1743963	And I light no fire because like or was it?
1743963	1744403	Yeah.
1744403	1745344	That's what it's called.
1745344	1745545	Yeah.
1746124	1752350	because I dig the Skyrim type vibe and the fact that they keep adding stuff to it.
1752350	1753391	That sounds really cool.
1753391	1754432	Well, here's the thing.
1754432	1766223	I wonder if now that the world has forgiven Hello Games with No Man's Sky, I wonder if Light No Fire is going to be their way to say, oh, now we can do DLC.
1766223	1767664	Now we can do a battle pass.
1768465	1792145	now we can do because that's what these expeditions feel like their battle passes you play a certain amount and do certain things you unlock cosmetics that's what a fucking battle pass is right so i wonder if light no fire i think some of these things we've been used to with no man's sky i wonder if light no fire isn't going to go back to a little more of what we expect and maybe you know what maybe i'm being unfair to hello games we'll find out when we find out but
1793218	1804487	I can't help but feel like, you know what, when they put out Light No Fire, they're probably going to start charging for a lot of the things that we see a lot of games charging for now because Hello Games doesn't have to apologize anymore.
1804487	1807349	They've they've made up for what happened seven.
1807349	1809731	I don't think they have to apologize anymore right now either.
1809731	1812133	I think they've long made up for all that stuff.
1812133	1814195	I just I don't know.
1814195	1819679	Like and I think even if they put out stuff as paid DLC, I think people would play it.
1819679	1821120	I think maybe there may be a
1822028	1833617	It may be hard to do that being that it is an online game and to like have certain exclusory content aside from like cosmetics.
1834417	1837138	would be very difficult for them to do.
1837138	1837698	I don't know.
1837698	1838638	Yeah.
1838638	1842500	YYR in chat says 77% positive reviews on the Steam page for No Man's Sky.
1842500	1843860	Sounds like they've been forgiven to me.
1843860	1844721	Yep.
1844721	1849062	And they consistently get nominated for awards for like best ongoing game.
1849062	1850002	It's always like that.
1850002	1854964	Final Fantasy 14, Fortnite, like these just games that, you know, very big games that keep going.
1854964	1858265	But No Man's Sky is always still in that conversation all these years later.
1858265	1860406	Questbuster says, I feel that while people remember,
1860806	1861487	Hello Games
1877506	1888555	I think No Man's Sky, I don't know, and I don't have the facts to back it up, but just my gut tells me a lot of people still bought that on the Switch, even though they may have had it on another platform or just they were buying it.
1888555	1895780	So like, I feel like because No Man's Sky keeps evolving to the new platforms, people are still buying the game.
1895780	1903186	And maybe there's a certain math to that where it's like, you know what, as long as we keep selling copies of the game, we're still making the money we need to make.
1903186	1904767	And maybe that's what will happen with Light No Fire.
1904767	1905128	I don't know.
1905128	1905448	We'll see.
1906028	1911472	And also, yeah, at least with that, like, the expectation is, you know, they're not building all this from scratch anymore.
1911472	1915094	They have the engine, essentially, for this.
1915094	1918896	So it should be certainly more solid than it was.
1918896	1920297	Yeah, we'll see what happens.
1920297	1922078	Anyway, so that's really it.
1922078	1923779	I will say, though, I've been doing a lot.
1923779	1926201	You all know I do GPS and AR gaming.
1926201	1930864	Pokemon Go had a community day this weekend, so I caught some Litten Chinese when I was out.
1931444	1931985	Ingress Event
1954585	1958287	There was probably about 100 agents that turned out in person in Berkeley for this.
1958287	1959427	Wow, that's pretty impressive considering.
1959427	1960308	Yeah, it's still pretty impressive.
1960308	1968511	I mean, that's pretty much NorCal's representation, but that's still pretty good because they had a similar event in Pasadena.
1968511	1970933	I think Vancouver, Canada had one the same night.
1970933	1972733	I think there was a city in Arizona.
1972733	1976255	So there was a lot of different sites that were having these flash start events.
1976255	1980077	But yeah, drawing in 100 people on a Friday night with two weeks notice,
1980757	1982098	is still pretty darn good.
1982098	1984819	So that was that was a good turnout.
1984819	1988101	And then I've been playing Monster Hunter now, also Niantic.
1988101	1992203	And I got to say, I've been really impressed with how this game is coming along.
1992203	1994544	This game is a lot of fun to play with other people.
1994544	1996025	It runs really smooth.
1996025	2002128	I would say if you're into Pokemon Go and you haven't checked out Monster Hunter now yet, you really should like it's a really smooth.
2002128	2002988	It runs very well.
2002988	2009232	They just did a seasonal update where they added new monsters, I guess, from and here's the funny thing.
2009972	2011433	And this is similar to Pikmin, right?
2011433	2013154	I like Pikmin Bloom.
2013154	2015335	Don't really care for the Pikmin console games.
2015335	2016356	Monster Hunter now.
2016356	2018237	I don't care for the Monster Hunter console games.
2018237	2018617	I don't.
2018617	2019778	I've tried.
2019778	2020899	I just I just don't get into it.
2020899	2023540	But Monster Hunter now, I think it's a hell of a lot of fun.
2023540	2026802	And, you know, people are like, oh, but the battle's just tapping your phone over and over.
2026802	2029964	But it's like, no, there's you have to well time your dodges.
2029964	2032105	You have to make sure you're hitting the monster in a certain place.
2032105	2032966	You want to hit the weak point.
2032966	2034326	You want to break a certain part.
2034326	2038389	There's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that goes into it because we were trying to break the tail on Arathion today.
2038889	2040450	to finish a quest, and we couldn't do it.
2040450	2043392	There was a party of four of us, and we kept killing it before it was gone.
2043392	2051939	So anyway, they have a new season, and they now have their version of transmogrification or glamour.
2051939	2056382	So now you can make your characters look certain ways, and some of the armor looks really cool, and you can do that.
2056382	2060645	But guess what else they added in Monster Hunter now with all this?
2060645	2061666	Let me see if I can bring it up.
2061666	2062886	Oh, here it is.
2062886	2064668	Yep, I brought it up on the screen for it.
2064668	2067210	Guess what this is, and I'm showing it on the screen on my phone.
2067850	2083881	that is a season pass with a free tier and a premium tier and look at that you've got your cosmetic unlocks just in time for the glamour feature that are all available on the premium tier here's the thing though
2084890	2090034	I'm a little less irritated with Monster Hunter now doing it because it is a free game.
2090034	2091315	And I get it.
2091315	2092896	Ain't nothing free in this world.
2092896	2094617	Developers got to be paid.
2094617	2103843	But I still I can't help but eye roll a little bit because I'm like, when everybody's doing a battle pass, no one's gonna buy a battle pass.
2103843	2105024	Something to think about.
2105024	2105605	That's all.
2105605	2106365	Right?
2106365	2111549	Like with 500 live service games in development, not all of them are gonna have people playing them.
2111549	2111669	Yeah.
2112062	2133515	but at least yeah again I'm not gonna give Niantic or Capcom shit for having that because again it's a free game it's that's where you expect to see the battle passes fine it's the triple-a games that come out for $70 and then have the nerve to do a battle pass on top of that which yes Diablo 4 is one of them and I still play that game so maybe I'm the problem hi it's me but um
2134335	2143404	You know, I think there's a lot less people willing to pony it up in a game like Diablo 4 than there are in the free games where it's like, eh, whatever, it's free.
2143404	2146247	I know quite a few people that ponied up for the premium pass.
2146247	2147027	I can see it.
2147027	2151111	If I go through my friends list, I can see, oh, they have the hoodie from the premium pass.
2151111	2151952	They have the hoodie for the premium.
2151952	2155316	I'm like, I know who bought it.
2155316	2155516	So.
2156445	2156925	Bell Passes
2175856	2193458	just about everything in Ingress is in Monster Hunter now so you may actually see more landmarks because the the pokestop algorithm doesn't create multiple pokestops in a certain radius like you can't have more than two in a certain map cell but it's a little more generous in Ingress and Monster Hunter now so you might actually see more stuff so
2194762	2197925	E3VL says imagine people doing dailies for more than five games.
2197925	2199746	Monster Hunter now has dailies.
2199746	2200507	But you know what?
2200507	2203389	They brought dailies into Ingress now all these years later.
2203389	2206071	Do you know this July I will have been playing Ingress for 10 years?
2207472	2208633	And that game's still going.
2208633	2213237	I don't know for how much longer, sadly, but that game's still going, you know, it's 10 years now.
2213237	2214658	So it's wild.
2214658	2217100	But anyway, Monster Hunter now.
2217100	2217961	It's neat.
2217961	2218441	Check it out.
2218441	2220082	They just released a new season.
2220082	2221844	It's like a whole new patch for the game.
2221844	2229170	And considering the game just came out six months ago, that's some really encouraging support to see, honestly.
2229170	2230151	All right.
2230151	2233814	Well, with that, we will get into some gaming news for the week.
2233814	2234814	So Loki,
2235609	2238710	We've been joking a lot about quadruple A tonight.
2238710	2239970	Yeah, let's get some more.
2239970	2241050	Let's get some more.
2241050	2246771	But more, you know, I don't know, jargon for the game industry.
2246771	2251092	So now, now I guess I a little bit tongue in cheek, I guess.
2251092	2259434	But apparently there's a conglomerate of indie gamers that have come up with the triple I initiative.
2260718	2267324	Triple Eye actually has a website, it's the Triple Eye Initiative.
2267324	2274149	It describes itself as a mysterious teasing page.
2274149	2280534	It's from the studios of Darkest Dungeon, Risk of Rain, Slay the Spire, Vampire Survivors, View Rising, etc.
2285074	2292630	Yeah, I don't know what it necessarily is, but apparently you can sign up for updates and they're going to make an announcement in about 11 days.
2294980	2317767	So I wonder it's almost like all these different studios getting together to build their own hype machine for indie games is what I kind of maybe I mean maybe or like it may be like committing to like certain standards or something like that because I know certainly in the AAA space that's kind of one of the things it's like well hey you're having me pay 70 for a game that is broken like how many
2318447	2327390	How many developers have, and we have stories about that coming up later in the show, how many developers have like apologized for the state that their game is released in?
2327390	2332432	Or publishers even, like, it's inexcusable at this point, I feel.
2332432	2339215	Like, to release a game that is this knowingly broken, you know it's broken, because like,
2340274	2340955	Thanks for watching!
2353717	2354358	Thanks for watching!
2376866	2378007	their game.
2378007	2379389	Like, I don't know.
2379389	2381892	So hopefully that's what we see coming out of this.
2381892	2384655	Or maybe just some advertising for some indie studios.
2384655	2386017	Either way.
2386017	2388079	Mike Defton Chat says, I blame investors.
2388079	2389300	No, seriously, that's it.
2389300	2389901	And guess what?
2389901	2390862	Yeah, yeah.
2390862	2393145	And guess what the indie studios don't have to worry about?
2393145	2394006	Investors.
2394006	2396108	So aye aye aye to that.
2398118	2403659	I want someone just to treat me like the investor or like the game companies treat investors, man.
2403659	2408641	No, they have an investor, their own pockets and some parents and friends.
2408641	2409241	Yeah, that's true.
2409241	2411761	The investors really are the people, right?
2411761	2411921	Yeah.
2411921	2414502	And the hype machines end up being the people as well a little bit, too.
2414502	2419503	So I think it's kind of interesting that these different indie studios are kind of getting together to do their own sort of hype machine, though.
2419503	2420863	It's very I don't know.
2420863	2424284	I think there's something really kind of cool and kind of punk rock about that almost.
2424284	2425164	I don't know.
2425164	2427085	It'll be interesting to see what they do, though.
2427725	2428105	We'll see.
2428105	2430807	I love the tongue in cheek attack on the quadruple A game though.
2430807	2437191	Like, like, you know, again, Yves Guillaume continuously putting foot in his mouth.
2437191	2440694	Time and time again, how he's still running that company is anyone's guess.
2440694	2446378	But you know, anyway, all right, let's move on.
2446378	2452442	Let's talk about Oh, oh, actually, there's a little bit on pal world with all that, right, Loki?
2453632	2457995	Yeah, so Palworld devs basically are saying that, hey, AAA games are not for us.
2457995	2461458	They want to stick to smaller sized games.
2461458	2463099	We don't like the attention.
2463099	2466962	Yeah, basically, hey, we are and will remain a small studio.
2466962	2471265	I want to make multiple small games, big budget AAA games are not for us.
2471265	2472306	I mean, that's fine.
2472306	2473127	It's a kind of a
2474591	2475911	It's a breath of fresh air.
2475911	2484133	I mean, these are the same developers that said, you know, hey, yeah, we understand that like our Steam playing time is or concurrent players is going down.
2484133	2486533	And that's fine because the game has an end.
2486533	2487594	And you know what?
2487594	2489534	You can go play other fun games that are out there.
2489534	2491514	You don't have to keep playing our game.
2491514	2493675	You know, we're glad that you purchased it and played it.
2493675	2495675	We're going to have more content coming for it later on.
2495675	2498376	But you don't have to live your life in this game.
2498376	2499476	You know, it's not going to
2500396	2529495	make or break us whether you do that which I think is completely fair like that's a fair statement to make and it's also a very healthy statement to make that once again and like because that's kind of the the position that a lot of these big AAA studios they want you to live in like a lot of the times you like you hear them describing it's like yeah we want you to come in we want you to work we want you to earn money or earn like especially when it's NFT games we want you to earn you know they they describe the game like a job it's like
2530498	2530798	I don't
2553088	2559792	Game companies, I think, have lost their way, or some game companies, larger game companies, have kind of lost their way of what games are.
2559792	2562594	It's supposed to be fun.
2562594	2565036	It's supposed to be a way to escape and relax.
2565036	2566597	No, they print money.
2566597	2567377	Money, money, money.
2567377	2568658	They have ways to get money.
2568658	2569759	Pull slot machine.
2569759	2570399	Make money.
2570399	2571220	Buy Battle Pass.
2571220	2571520	Get money.
2572588	2574810	You know, more grind, more content.
2574810	2576011	That's how it works.
2576011	2576391	Yeah.
2576391	2577552	Got to get that grind set.
2577552	2579854	Those dumb nerds will throw money at anything.
2579854	2581735	We'll just do a pallet swap and then charge for it.
2581735	2581956	Money.
2581956	2583537	Those stupid nerds, they'll pay for it.
2583537	2584958	That's how it started.
2584958	2586519	That's how it started, you know?
2586519	2588841	And honestly, like, they do try to do that.
2588841	2592784	Like, $20 for a blue skin.
2592784	2596327	You know, or just skin with horse armor.
2596327	2597388	That's where it all began.
2597388	2598049	Horse armor.
2598049	2599290	Goddamn you, Bethesda.
2600216	2610780	All right, anyway, on a somewhat related note to PAL world, there's a lot of people out there that are wondering what Pokemon and or Nintendo lawyers are up to these days, wink, wink, nudge.
2610780	2619003	Well, I guess we already heard about Nintendo lawyers on last week's show, but let's talk a little bit about Pokemon lawyers, or in this case, a former Pokemon lawyer.
2619003	2628007	In fact, the former chief legal officer for the Pokemon company, Don McGowan is the person's name, was recently doing an interview with Aftermath.
2628587	2637800	and for some reason people all of a sudden are very interested in what is the Pokemon company's process for like going after fan projects.
2637800	2640023	Not that I have anything in mind.
2641578	2649003	I would be sitting in my office minding my own business when someone from the company would send me a link to a news article, or I would stumble across it myself.
2659810	2673199	I teach entertainment law at the University of Washington and say this to my students, the worst thing on earth is when your fan project gets press because now I know about you.
2673199	2675901	But that's not the end of the equation.
2675901	2677942	You don't send a takedown right away.
2677942	2681965	You wait to see if they get funded for a Kickstarter or similar.
2681965	2684947	If they get funded, that's when you engage.
2684947	2686388	No one likes suing fans.
2687264	2696546	And that's the that's the quote, which sounds a little bit dastardly, but at the same time, to me, draws a very clear line in the sand.
2696546	2698427	And that's money, right?
2698427	2698887	Right.
2698887	2704828	Because if you're just an ordinary dude that's just making a fan game, they can't see you and get any money from you.
2704828	2706109	That would cost that.
2706109	2706629	What's the point?
2706629	2710690	You know, they're clearly going after a fan who has no source of income.
2711010	2712231	Well, you know, you know what I mean?
2712231	2713672	Based on the project, right?
2713672	2718536	Maybe a different job sort of income, but nothing directly related to the project.
2718536	2722098	But then when it's, oh, we made money off a Kickstarter.
2722098	2726402	Oh, now you're profiting off of this.
2726402	2732086	We're gonna take all that money or, you know, shut it down because again, it crossed the money threshold.
2733083	2735364	which funny enough, very interesting.
2735364	2740527	We were talking about that emulator last week, which by the way, lots of very good followup on our discord server.
2740527	2745770	I'm going to point you our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
2745770	2750653	And Bobby on his show tonight got a lot further into this than maybe I necessarily want to again tonight.
2750653	2757337	But I thought there was a lot of interesting kind of like clarifications and sort of like clearing the air on the whole like emulator saga story.
2757337	2760319	And it really boils down to these emulator keys.
2761019	2780198	are the key quote unquote thing that sort of separates this from something say what you did there we were drawing comparisons to bleem last week well bleem didn't have keys that these newer sort of so anyway more information on the discord I would really encourage you to check out our discord to continue the conversation throughout the week because you know some of you
2781019	2787843	have your hands in fandoms that go beyond, you know, what we, you know, gaming is a big wide world.
2787843	2789083	It's a big pool.
2789083	2789604	It's not a pool.
2789604	2790624	It's an ocean.
2790624	2794246	It is a big ocean of content.
2794246	2796247	And we try to stay on top of it best we can.
2796247	2800069	But sometimes y'all are in pieces of the ocean that we can't even explore.
2800069	2801410	But anyway, my point is,
2802190	2805832	with the emulator story is that again, it was money, right?
2805832	2807653	Money came into that whole thing.
2807653	2821982	And that's where Nintendo then showed up and said, Oh, hell no, you know, and a very interesting sort of comment from the Pokemon former employee as well, which I think is important to say, but I can't imagine a lot of that has necessarily changed.
2821982	2823623	So.
2823623	2826545	So if you're a fan project out there,
2827441	2831205	Number one, don't openly make money off the project.
2831205	2833468	Number two, don't talk about fan project.
2833468	2835030	Don't release it till it's done.
2835030	2836812	Yeah, don't talk about fight club.
2836812	2839034	I mean, fan project.
2839034	2839815	Exactly.
2839815	2840916	Game club.
2840916	2842538	Wait, Bruno.
2842538	2845542	Anyway, uh, let's move on DarkSakura.
2846946	2855049	So if there's a company that's good at making things old new again, that would be Atari.
2855049	2864413	And Atari is bringing back some of its classic games, and actually even more, with the Recharged series.
2864413	2868134	So there's been some tests already out.
2868134	2874877	They are using the, and I think it's great that it's called Allen One, the video arcade system.
2875697	2877878	because that's a Tron reference.
2877878	2878559	It sure is.
2878559	2879119	I remember.
2879119	2880060	Wow.
2880060	2880420	Yeah.
2880420	2881301	Yeah, it is.
2881301	2882101	Nice.
2882101	2889006	And so there are they have like different interactive effects.
2889006	2891948	And they said it's actually inspired by virtual pinball.
2891948	2897872	So it has like knockers, shake motors, blower fans, things like that to boost the experience of the games.
2901853	2911115	I might have said they were already in location testing, so there is an Avian Knights that's out in the wild.
2911115	2914756	So yeah, if any of you find any of these out, let us know.
2914756	2927680	But the Recharge series presently is made up of Berserk, Recharge, Quantum, Caverns of Mars, Asteroid, Centipede, Black Widow, Breakout, Gravitar, Missile Command, and Yars.
2929364	2932106	I have the yars recharged and it's pretty pretty decent.
2932106	2937450	Like it's it's much better than a lot of the other kind of modernizations of that game.
2937450	2940772	So yeah, the recharge series is interesting.
2940772	2946136	So neat, neat to see them going this direction with it.
2946136	2948878	I'm hoping to have a big revival in arcades.
2948878	2949178	Yeah.
2949178	2950499	Do these machines spit tickets?
2951681	2952422	I do find it really cool.
2952422	2953623	They're turning those into legit arcade games.
2953623	2954824	I do have a couple between Switch and PC.
2954824	2956785	Weren't they giving one away at one point?
2956785	2957566	I feel like they did.
2957566	2958407	I don't know anyway.
2958407	2960428	But yeah, I think the Recharge series is pretty cool.
2960428	2960609	Great.
2979895	2981696	Yeah, I'd love to see that come full circle.
2981696	2986559	I would love to see arcades come to life again, but I don't know.
2986559	2989601	It's it's it's rough out there anyway.
2989601	2991522	Loki.
2991522	2993203	Yeah, apparently I will.
2993203	3001809	It's very obvious because there's a big red message on the Minecraft launcher, but apparently there was a bug in the Xbox
3002350	3005711	app regarding upgrading Minecraft.
3005711	3013833	And according to Mojang's official support account on Twitter, they are advising people not to update Minecraft through the Xbox app.
3013833	3018535	Thankfully, I don't play through the Xbox app, so no worries for me.
3018535	3021596	And I also thought this was only for Bedrock, but maybe it's not.
3021596	3021916	I don't know.
3022476	3027961	Also, I play Fabric, so it's not the same launcher anyways.
3027961	3034868	And it can result in your game actually, or your worlds, being deleted.
3034868	3044697	So, and this has happened, apparently folks have had their worlds, many years worth of playtime in them, just wiped out.
3045538	3046978	from these updates.
3046978	3057480	There is a update repair tool that is supposed to be for a gaming service repair tool for PC, which I did run that.
3057480	3063341	I don't know what that necessarily does, but I think it fixes the issue with the Xbox app.
3063341	3065902	But once again, don't play through the Xbox app.
3065902	3066742	So good for me.
3066742	3069603	But yeah, that sucks.
3069603	3071443	It's a big old blight.
3072105	3074506	I do use the Xbox app, so this is concerning.
3074506	3078088	Now, thankfully, I'm not quite as invested in Minecraft as Loki is.
3078088	3082610	I don't really have like a... Usually every time I get a bug to go play Minecraft, I just start a new world anyway.
3082610	3084351	But yeah, it's a little bit scary, to be honest.
3084351	3086592	Yeah, and I don't have any single-player worlds anyways.
3086592	3089974	It's all online, so there's nothing getting deleted from the Xbox app.
3090174	3092095	Yeah, makes sense, makes sense.
3092095	3095115	All right, well, let's talk a little bit about Unreal Engine.
3095115	3099837	And as we know, the Unreal Engine is a very big resource for creating games.
3099837	3111760	But as we've seen now, as we're getting into these more and more, the more these things can do with the Unreal Engine, we're starting to see that TV, movies are actually using this.
3111760	3114921	You might remember when they were first showing Unreal Engine 5, right?
3114921	3115321	The newest one?
3115321	3117361	Yeah, 5.4 is the newest, newest one.
3117361	3118942	But when they were first showing Unreal Engine 5,
3119762	3123583	Epic Games is now announcing a new pricing structure for a non-game developer to use this because
3139489	3142712	There's no income stream for them otherwise.
3142712	3145414	So they have to kind of make money from this somehow.
3145414	3147015	But there's a lot of rules with this.
3147015	3148777	So let me try to cover some of this.
3148777	3154361	So the per seat subscription to use Unreal for a non gaming purpose is $1,850.
3154361	3157424	And that's basically like per license.
3157424	3161767	So per user sitting at a computer desk using it, it's you know, 1850.
3161767	3164329	So if you have 10 people, you know, you do the math, etc.
3164329	3164369	Um,
3166701	3171403	This is going to be going into effect when 5.4 releases in late April.
3171403	3182309	And of course, if you are making TV shows, movies, you're going to have to pay this fee because otherwise you're not, you know, there's no way Epic, Epic isn't getting royalties.
3182309	3183510	That's the problem.
3183510	3189713	So Epic can get royalties from games, they can't get royalties from, I think this is fascinating, theme park rides.
3190673	3194436	And now that I think about like a lot of rides I've gone on at like Universal and stuff.
3194436	3197339	Oh, yeah, they're probably using this for theme park rides for sure.
3197339	3202563	So I think this is very interesting, all these different places to get this from.
3202563	3213932	Also, very important sort of, you know, twist on this is that this this whole system is still III friendly, if you will, even for the TV and movie world, because
3214632	3222460	If you are a company that makes less than a million in annual gross revenue, you don't have to pay the fee.
3222460	3233311	So if you're, you know, college learning on Unreal and assuming you don't have anything that made over a million or you're an indie studio, like super indie, not making anything over a million, you don't have to pay to Unreal.
3233311	3235493	So that's kind of nice for that.
3235493	3237455	You can also license portions
3238195	3243598	of Unreal Engine, the Twinmotion real-time visualization tool, $4.45 a year.
3243598	3246200	RealityCapture, $12.50 a year.
3246200	3247661	So pretty neat.
3247661	3253784	By the way, that $1 million cutoff, you may or may not recall, that is also true for games.
3253784	3256626	So your games don't have to pay a royalty share.
3256626	3261469	They upped that from $50,000 to $1 million in the COVID era in 2020.
3261469	3263670	So very interesting sort of line there.
3263670	3265031	So as long as you're not a millionaire,
3265771	3272916	with your job after your job, you will be alright and can use the Unreal Engine for this, which I think is pretty cool.
3272916	3284904	Loki, I know this might be a silly question, but with all the moviemaking that you've been doing, have you been considering using Unreal to I mean, I guess maybe it is silly because I know most of your stuff is driven in Minecraft, but I know you've been you've been doing a lot of things.
3285845	3295423	You know, like your, I think in the latest video that had all the tropes from YouTube and all that stuff, like you obviously did a lot of work in Premiere or whatever video editing you use to do all that.
3295423	3298228	Have you ever thought about using Unreal for some flashy type of things?
3298985	3302727	No, because that's more of like, I think, for building virtual sets.
3302727	3305208	They do that a lot, or motion capture.
3305208	3307388	They'll use the Unreal stuff.
3307388	3309329	It's not something I would be doing.
3309329	3315211	The only example I'm aware of, I think, is I think there's Linus Tech Tips.
3315211	3319693	They have a channel called Game Linked, where they do gaming news.
3319693	3323535	And I want to say that their set is a virtual set in Unreal Engine.
3324508	3325769	Five that they've built.
3325769	3327170	So it would be something like that.
3327170	3333975	They would probably have to pay because unless they consider GameLink its own company, which I don't think they would.
3333975	3338398	But that's kind of where that use case would be.
3338398	3339920	I can see this more.
3339920	3343222	Yeah, I can see this more like.
3343222	3346584	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out Mandalorian used Unreal.
3346584	3349106	Well, we OK, we know who's paying the money then.
3349106	3350968	Like, you know, Disney is going to be paying some money.
3351912	3359220	I mean, I would imagine Unreal would be good for that type of thing since you can drag things in place, as it were.
3359220	3367329	But, I mean, I know people who have been making their own virtual backgrounds and things like Blender and Daz 3D and whatnot for ages.
3369030	3376495	3D, you can easily, you know, use, uh, existing media out there, you know, just license it and boom, there you go.
3376495	3377435	You've got a background.
3377435	3380878	You don't need to run anything through, um, Unreal.
3380878	3385240	You just create it and port it.
3385240	3386041	And it's free.
3386041	3387602	The, the application is free.
3387602	3392344	And, and for those of us who were in the Mac universe, you know, we've got Final Cut Pro.
3392344	3396147	We have Motion for doing graphic effects.
3396147	3396327	So.
3398541	3410883	Questbuster in chat points out car companies like GM, General Motors, and BMW also use Unreal, which for those car commercials and Flashgate makes sense to me, absolutely.
3410883	3411584	Very interesting.
3412438	3414379	Yeah, there's a lot of use cases for it.
3414379	3414980	Yeah.
3414980	3418562	But it's really neat to see how the gaming world is.
3418562	3429870	You know, we've talked a lot on this show, and especially over our long, long history, we've talked a lot about how we see the gaming industry oftentimes following in the movie industry and TV industry's footsteps with many things.
3429870	3441958	But here's a very interesting case where now the and it's not to say this hasn't happened before, but it's just another one in the list of now here's the gaming industry leading the movie industry, which is very fascinating, I think.
3441958	3442098	So.
3442638	3443739	Interesting.
3443739	3448884	Bobby does point out if you want to check out some of this how the Mandalorian uses Unreal Engine, it's on YouTube.
3448884	3449945	So you can check it out.
3449945	3455871	So or maybe, maybe not YouTube, but maybe Disney plus behind the scenes type of featurettes, you know, you can you can find it.
3455871	3458754	So pretty cool.
3458754	3459475	Yes, it does.
3459475	3464439	DarkSakura, I guess while we're on a Disney note.
3464439	3466822	So well,
3467392	3486670	Another thing, I feel kind of like I don't want to talk about it for some of the reasons that were mentioned before, but there is a homebrew developer named Frogbull, the same one who got Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy running on the Saturn.
3489645	3499177	is making a Star Wars game for Dreamcast called Star Wars Dream of the Rebellion that was inspired by Rogue Squadron, the same one by Factor 5.
3499177	3503403	And so you are an X-wing fighter pilot and you have to take down TIE Fighters.
3506365	3515652	And he was very impressed, he said, with how Sega created this in that, you know, in the universe and how fun it was.
3515652	3521936	But the games didn't make their way to Dreamcast, so they were all just on, you know, the older consoles.
3521936	3526819	There was Jedi Power Battles, Demolition, Episode One Racer.
3526819	3532423	So, but none of them would let you play an X-Wing, so he wanted to do that.
3538585	3546674	There is a demo out by the way, I am just a little concerned as to what would happen
3548146	3553771	You know, if, I mean, hopefully it's not going to be putting this out for any kind of money or asking for funding for it.
3553771	3559555	So, but it would still, it's still touching two pretty big franchises.
3559555	3565761	You know, we've got the entire Star Wars universe and Disney can be quite litigious.
3565761	3573987	Um, but you also have Sega with their, granted defunct hardware, but still their hardware.
3573987	3574948	Don't cross the money line.
3574948	3577030	And the game that they, they created.
3577030	3577190	Yeah.
3582948	3587711	Now this is where I completely draw the line.
3587711	3600337	He's using AI tech for the voice of C-3PO by ripping lines from Rogue Squadron and Rogue Leader and X-Wing Alliance to synthesize the voice.
3600337	3603099	So this is basically taking Anthony Daniels' voice
3605384	3608125	because I'm not sure if actually I'm not sure if he did the ones for those games.
3608125	3609865	I would think that he did.
3609865	3620528	But but still, if he's if he's taking that voice and recreating it for use in his project, that is a legal use of likeness.
3620528	3624589	Yeah.
3624589	3632852	Bobby does point out Lucasfilm has fan film guidelines that would probably be applicable here, but that's that voice thing is a really slippery slope.
3632852	3633332	Yeah.
3633332	3633492	Oof.
3635868	3637849	So, careful with that.
3637849	3641651	Yeah, I can't.
3641651	3644893	That just right there soured the whole project for me.
3644893	3646554	I mean, I'm interested in it.
3646554	3650376	I would love to see it, but not with all of this going on.
3650376	3658981	You know how I'm against AI for mimicking, you know, a paid actor's voice.
3660987	3665469	Yeah, you need to get somebody else to record the lines for you, a different actor playing the same part.
3665469	3667350	I'll be C-3PO for you.
3667350	3668291	And you know what?
3668291	3670972	I can do the C-3PO voice for your game.
3670972	3672553	Just give me a call.
3672553	3675395	I am fluent in over 5 million languages.
3675395	3676035	That's right.
3676035	3676915	Just look me up.
3676915	3678997	I'll do C-3PO so you don't have to use shitty AI.
3678997	3686881	Just go in like a completely... Yeah, I was gonna say, just go in a completely different direction like Arlonauts did with like Creepio.
3690723	3692584	You can create your own protocol, Droid.
3692584	3697347	Just put some letters and numbers together and make sure it sounds neat as a nickname.
3697347	3701950	C69DJ.
3701950	3703211	That can be my Android name.
3705734	3707615	All right.
3707615	3710958	SSJ100 Matt said I was Mr. Movie Phone.
3710958	3712519	Oh, whatever.
3712519	3725469	Anyway, and Bobby does point out what he said was before that part about the AI of a, you know, voice actor that's not involved, but also pointing out fan film guidelines say create your own characters.
3725469	3727370	So very important distinction there.
3727370	3728531	So.
3728531	3729552	All right.
3729552	3730973	Well, Loki, you have something on Star Wars?
3730973	3733795	And eventually they'll take your character and make them canon.
3733795	3733975	Yeah.
3737481	3744964	What I have about Star Wars is an apology for doing a shitty job at porting a game or remastering a game.
3744964	3746885	First off, good news.
3751881	3754404	Let's do the good news before the bad news.
3754404	3764475	The good news is that the company that was working on Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, the remake of that, Saber Interactive, has been sold for $500 million.
3769371	3773475	That was, of course, owned by the Embracer group at the time.
3773475	3787029	And Saber also owned, was it 4A Studios, which you may remember, they were the ones that ported, I think, Minecraft to the early console stuff.
3787029	3793155	That was on... Oh, I'm sorry, they're the Metro game series developers.
3793655	3795316	Zen Studios, Beacon Interactive
3815040	3828705	Saber is going to keep Nimble Giant, 3D Realms, Sandbox Strategies, New World Interactive, Slipgate, Ironworks, Madhead Games, and Fractured Bites.
3828705	3838569	Embracer is still going to own Tripwire, Beamdog, Tuxilla Labs, and a bunch of other game companies I'm not familiar with.
3838569	3843811	That's good, at least several studios are surviving the Embracer group.
3844517	3845097	Biasco
3862390	3888018	did a really terrible job with it they put out a statement apologize or they didn't apologize for the issues but said that they recognize that there are issues it says we'd like to thank the battlefront community for an overwhelming support and feedback for the star wars classic our battlefront classic collection release at launch we experienced critical errors with our network infrastructure this result in high ping matchmaking errors and crashes i'm going to tell you right now that that's not the extent of it that's part of it
3888698	3891799	But there's a lot of... The game is really broken.
3891799	3894260	Really, really broken.
3894260	3900381	They said, please continue to submit bug reports to us through our request form.
3900381	3901461	Thank you.
3901461	3903902	We'll do the bug troubleshooting for you.
3903902	3906803	That's fantastic.
3906803	3907823	Yeah, it's bad.
3907823	3910864	Like, it's overwhelmingly negative on Steam right now.
3910864	3913125	The videos I've seen of the bugs...
3915350	3916751	You can't hit anybody.
3916751	3926218	You just spin around every time you die, like the camera just spins rapidly around.
3926218	3927679	It's bad.
3927679	3933483	But hey, it's 70 gigabytes because they put a bunch of clips from the movies in there, whereas this game originally was like...
3935908	3937869	a few gigabytes because I think it was on DVD.
3937869	3941950	I mean, it was on the PlayStation 2 at one time.
3941950	3943991	Yeah, I think it was PlayStation 2 era.
3943991	3948433	So yeah, they blew up the game to 70 gigabytes with all these stupid clips.
3948433	3949814	Probably uncompressed video.
3949814	3950214	Cool.
3950214	3950834	Thanks.
3950834	3951974	Thanks, Aspyr.
3951974	3955576	Worth the price of admission.
3955576	3955776	Wow.
3957806	3968852	It's really unfortunate too, because with a name like that and a game that people remember, there's probably even more people that get suckered into pre-ordering it and buying this on day one and all of that, that then just end up with a subpar product.
3968852	3971873	And it's just, it's so crappy.
3971873	3978837	Like this, this is why Steam has a return policy for if you've only played so many, so much time of it, you can return it.
3978837	3984820	And why ultimately, I know a lot of developers fucking hate that thing, but here, here's where it's needed.
3984820	3985540	Unfortunately,
3987301	3992664	And while this epidemic still exists, investors are the problem.
3992664	3997647	And shit like this is coming out when it's still in a half-baked state, and this is it.
3997647	3998167	Yeah.
3998167	4000648	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, gotta hold them accountable somehow.
4000648	4001529	So it sucks.
4001529	4010294	I feel for the developers that... It was a console game too, so it's great for the Steam users, but it sucks for everybody else that purchased it on consoles.
4011316	4014907	are people asking for refunds because sometimes they get it on consoles.
4014907	4015730	I think people are.
4015730	4016452	Yeah.
4016452	4017194	I don't know.
4017194	4017515	We'll see.
4019144	4023848	Well, speaking of consoles, the PlayStation 5 got an update this week.
4023848	4026951	The 9.0 firmware update, if you can believe it.
4026951	4029553	How far we've come, my goodness.
4029553	4035678	So we had a beta for 9.0 recently, but now it just went out for PlayStation 5 owners earlier this week.
4035678	4040062	As a part of this, you have enhancements to DualSense and DualSense Edge controller audio.
4040062	4044586	I noticed for my PlayStation, when I turned it on, it did an update to my controller first.
4044986	4050532	The speakers are louder and the speakers sound clearer when broadcasting in game sounds and voice chat.
4050532	4053656	The microphone is also apparently improved.
4053656	4057800	Sony says a new AI machine learning model.
4057800	4059542	All right, but it's well.
4060163	4066330	It's just suppressing background noises from button presses and game audio, leading to an improved voice chat experience.
4066330	4068893	So we're just talking, I think they're just... That's fine.
4068893	4073138	Yeah, I think they're using AI as a marketing thing here because to me that's noise print.
4073138	4075260	That noise prints have been a thing in...
4076721	4078462	Audio editing programs for a long time.
4078462	4079922	It's just being able to do that on the fly.
4079922	4080243	Sure.
4080243	4080643	Fine.
4080643	4081043	AI.
4081043	4081643	Machines.
4081643	4082043	Great.
4082043	4083424	Yay.
4083424	4087045	There's also brightness adjustments for the PS5 power indicator.
4087045	4090686	You can get that in settings, system, beep and light, and then brightness.
4090686	4095508	Yes, there is actually a menu in PlayStation called beep and light.
4095508	4096588	That beep and light.
4096588	4097589	I hate how bright it is.
4098774	4100275	That should have been the name of this program.
4100275	4102097	Beep and Light.
4102097	4105019	Maybe, maybe that could be a new video game.
4105019	4108321	Like what was what's the kid and chase?
4108321	4109942	What was that game?
4109942	4110463	I don't know.
4110463	4113925	But then we need to have a duo shooting game called Beep and Light.
4113925	4115746	You mean Lucky and Wild?
4115746	4117928	That's it, Lucky and Wild.
4117928	4119349	I'm thinking of another game too.
4119349	4121370	Oh, well, anyway, there was Bump and Chase as well.
4121370	4122111	Bump and Chase.
4122111	4123051	Yeah, Beep and Light.
4123051	4123552	Exactly.
4123552	4123772	Anyway.
4125499	4144336	share screen also of course lets you broadcast your gameplay now you can do pointers and emoji reactions so the people that you're sharing gameplay with can now point at things on the screen so in the case because this happens to me all the time look here you dummy they can actually use a pointer to say point point point it's right here
4144816	4146738	So that's actually kind of fun.
4146738	4147840	I think that's kind of cool.
4147840	4152785	And then they could do emoji reactions as well, which is silly, but also fun.
4152785	4158272	Speaking of emojis, Unicode 15.1 emojis are now reflected in the 9.0 update.
4158272	4159854	I don't know which emoji set that is.
4159854	4160654	There's a play erasure.
4161414	4162075	PlayStation 5 Pro
4179611	4180951	that is coming this holiday.
4180951	4194335	This is coming from Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming, saying that the PS5 Pro details that were leaked on YouTube came from documentation that Sony itself recently sent to third-party developers.
4194335	4203137	So apparently the PlayStation 5 Pro will offer improved and consistent framerate at 4K, as well as a performance mode for 8K.
4203137	4204798	Here we fucking go, 8K now.
4205838	4225494	also rendering games is supposed to be up to 45% quicker ray tracing capabilities that are two to three times faster and apparently the GPU will have 67 teraflops faster speed and better graphics it's just more parts inside more parts potentially better graphics
4227753	4230796	SSJ100 Matt says you can point to save game.
4230796	4238905	Yes, that would be what Bobby's doing when I'm streaming on share play as he would point at save, save your game, save your game.
4238905	4241008	All right.
4241008	4247155	E3VL over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says can't wait for The Last of Us Part One Remastered Pro.
4247155	4247255	Yeah.
4248667	4255131	Well, the thing with this, though, is it's obviously not able to output AK.
4255131	4259653	The rumor is that it has an upscaler built into it, like a really nice upscaler.
4259653	4262234	What was it?
4262234	4263135	AI upscaling?
4263135	4264436	That's what they'll call it.
4264436	4266157	Yeah, kind of.
4266157	4267537	Yeah, it's sort of like that.
4267537	4270959	Super resolution?
4270959	4273180	I don't remember the actual terminology.
4273180	4276282	It was spectral super resolution.
4276282	4276922	That's what it was.
4276922	4277743	Yeah, super resolution.
4278769	4287611	that apparently is better than FSR2, AMD's FSR2.
4287611	4290992	One step closer to the holodeck, right?
4290992	4292192	All right.
4292192	4302294	Anyhow, let's take a time to go down memory lane in this segment where you will not need a PlayStation 5 Pro to play this next game we're going to talk about, that's for sure.
4312938	4320705	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4320705	4324349	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4324349	4328833	Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us this week?
4328833	4331736	I picked EGG, Elemental Gimmick Gear.
4333144	4340408	is an action roleplay game that came out on the Dreamcast since we've had some Dreamcast news tonight.
4340408	4347332	It basically used hands-on art in an overhead view while you're exploring and then switches to 3D during boss battles.
4347332	4353856	It was developed by Birthday and published by Hudson Soft in Japan and Vatical Entertainment in the US.
4355223	4361245	So you have to go through different ruins and there are puzzles that need to be solved before you can move forward.
4361245	4365267	And the puzzles may have switch or moving objects around.
4365267	4375530	And then there are racing where your character rolls into a ball or an egg and races along rails to finish before the computer is done.
4375530	4376790	It's a weird one.
4376790	4377651	It was a really weird game.
4379211	4389493	So basically, just like a brief bit of backstory, in this world called Tokion, there are these dome-shaped ruins that were in a jungle.
4389493	4393234	They excavated it and pulled out an execute robot, and it had a sleeping guy in it.
4393234	4404596	And they made other little robots from this robot, you know, in its style, and then they all went and said, huh, we don't like you humans anymore, and went to go worship the big giant egg.
4404596	4406957	And then, you know, shenanigans.
4406957	4407617	Chaos ensues.
4408724	4422993	So, but at any rate, you have the main character who is the one who is asleep in the egg named The Sleeper, and he doesn't remember anything about himself, so they call him Leon.
4422993	4426295	But you can name him whatever you want to.
4426295	4434020	And he's been asleep for 5,000 years, which is how I wish I could feel when I wake up in the morning, but I feel like I've been asleep for, you know, five seconds.
4434820	4446086	You have also Dr. Yam, who works at the... He's the head doctor at the lab that found Leon.
4446086	4449888	Selen, who is also in the lab.
4449888	4452329	She's the one who gives Leon his name.
4452329	4457612	And then Lucky, who lost his parents when the Fogna, which are the little robot people,
4458152	4460874	Thank you all so much for watching!
4468948	4474149	E. Coli of GamePro, I'm going to just read the quote because I think it's a really apt description.
4474149	4481031	EGG has a surprisingly small world and playing time depending on how fast you can solve its mysteries.
4481031	4490373	While it lacks depth, EGG does offer some interesting and complex puzzles that will appeal mostly to gamers who aren't in a hurry.
4490373	4491893	And that's the game.
4493116	4496977	It was a cute game I played through, you know, I started it.
4496977	4501017	It wasn't really like my brand of game, really.
4501017	4510899	But, you know, it's very notable and it was kind of unique in terms of story and its style.
4510899	4515720	And so if you if you haven't played it, give it a go.
4515720	4519521	If you can find a Dreamcast and the game.
4519521	4521301	Yeah.
4521301	4521541	Yeah.
4523035	4525697	Do it that way.
4525697	4531220	Oh, I'll be looking somewhere else while you get a Dreamcast and play this game.
4531220	4533061	I'll try my best to find a Dreamcast.
4533061	4534322	All right.
4534322	4535883	I know you've got a Dreamcast.
4535883	4537024	I have in the closet.
4537024	4538084	And I have the game.
4538084	4539825	So if you want to play it, I'll lend it to you.
4539825	4542867	Somehow I didn't I didn't really know this game.
4542867	4545969	Sometimes you dig up these little gems or I'm like, how did I not know about this game?
4545969	4547310	But that's that's what this is for.
4547310	4548250	It's a new little game.
4548250	4550412	Edumacational content.
4550412	4550912	It's important.
4552452	4555949	Alright, EGG, Elemental Gimmick Gear, Game of the Week.
4558427	4561870	Okay, we have some other quick headlines for you.
4561870	4565072	And then we're going to get to the world release dates as well.
4565072	4568254	And then believe it or not, we're kind of already out of stories for the week.
4568254	4570716	But I think there may be a few things you want us to talk about.
4570716	4571556	We can do that as well.
4571556	4574018	And then we'll have the listener roundtable coming up shortly.
4574018	4577420	If anybody wants to call in, I know a few people expressed interest.
4577420	4585065	Oh, by the way, Bobby Blackwolf in chat mentions, and I saw some of his posts on Blue Sky about this, your Classic Game of the Week last week,
4588287	4588868	Puli Ruli
4607240	4613583	Puri Ruva I was reading from Bobby's comments, so... I'd like to buy a vowel.
4613583	4617544	I actually want to throw in a little fun thing.
4617544	4620886	You know who Seamus Blackley is, right?
4620886	4622567	Why does it sound familiar?
4622567	4624487	The father of the Xbox.
4624487	4626668	Yes, yes, okay, yeah, yeah.
4626668	4630590	Well, we kind of made acquaintances actually through baking.
4632057	4647829	He grows yeast out of the wild and makes really neat bread so he gave me some pointers for starting my new bread dough.
4647829	4657077	He actually put up pictures on social media about the prototype, or as he said, the prototype for the prototype of the Xbox.
4658668	4659589	Put up a picture of it.
4659589	4661230	It was really neat looking.
4661230	4665732	He also has another picture of it in his kitchen with a bunch of his yeasts in the background.
4665732	4670134	So it's like, I see we have some dough ready to go.
4670134	4671135	That's fun.
4671135	4674677	But I thought people would enjoy that.
4674677	4678499	I can find the post if anyone's interested.
4678499	4679319	There you go.
4679319	4680000	All right.
4680000	4684922	Well, meanwhile, let's talk about some other headlines that will come to rise to the occasion.
4684922	4686023	So, Loki, we'll start with you.
4687790	4689531	So this is pretty sweet.
4689531	4691792	I didn't know this was coming.
4691792	4700216	Interbang Entertainment and the Angry Metal Company have J and Silent Bob Chronic Blunt Punch coming.
4700216	4707719	It is a beat-em-up game based off of the two View Askewiverse characters.
4707719	4708580	That's amazing.
4708580	4710160	I need to check it out.
4712259	4715261	Yeah, they put a new trailer for it and it's all animated and stuff.
4715261	4720183	It makes me wish that the Clerks animated series was still a thing.
4720183	4721584	That thing was great.
4721584	4722244	It was.
4722244	4722745	It was great.
4722745	4724385	Big American party.
4724385	4726367	It still holds up all these years later.
4726367	4727087	And I love.
4727087	4727607	Yeah, exactly.
4727607	4735611	Because I love that, like the comments on the actual trailer video on YouTube were like, you know, why are we walking this way?
4735611	4736232	I was like, yes.
4736792	4739534	There are still people out there that remember this.
4739534	4741615	That's awesome.
4741615	4742336	So cool.
4742336	4743096	So we have that.
4743096	4753963	Then I was reminded by Jamie's pics a few weeks ago of Robotech Crystal Dreams that, hey, there's Macross games still coming out.
4753963	4756765	And we have now Red Arts Games has announced that
4758826	4767671	Bushiroad's Macross Shooting Insight will be coming to the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Switch in North America this year.
4767671	4768112	Nice!
4769229	4775132	So we'll actually get to play some Macross games over here and I'll have to import them, which is great.
4775132	4776213	Finally.
4776213	4789699	I think, gosh, the last Macross game I played was I think the one on Dreamcast, like Macross M, which was the one that was around when Macross 7 was out.
4789699	4792381	But yeah.
4792381	4797904	There's only one Macross game that's come out that I haven't enjoyed, and that was the PC Engine one that was a strategy game.
4799878	4803480	This one looks like a, um, just a space shmup game.
4803480	4808703	So it's very, um, Gradius inspired, it looked like.
4808703	4810584	Interesting.
4810584	4818788	A lot of the other ones had been sort of like these 3D, like free roaming-ish kind of games.
4818788	4821569	I would totally play the shit out of this.
4821569	4822570	Nice.
4822570	4824231	Well, now you can, later this year.
4824231	4825871	As long as I don't have to hear Minmay sing.
4825871	4828633	Uh, DarkSakura, what do you got for us for Rapid Fire?
4830731	4834117	SNK and Arika are...
4835228	4837409	having a big team-up.
4837409	4843190	They're gonna collaborate to bring back some of the old non-fighting IPs.
4843190	4849532	So, um... Since, you know, basically stuff that came out on Neo Geo.
4849532	4859576	So, um... We don't know exactly what the games are being included, but I would think it would be stuff like, you know, Metal Gear?
4859576	4860516	Not Metal Gear.
4860516	4861116	Why'd I say that?
4861116	4862817	Metal Slug!
4862817	4863957	Um, you know, so...
4865552	4866573	I hope.
4866573	4868694	That'd be cool.
4868694	4871516	Please.
4871516	4872656	All right.
4872656	4877539	Well, one other story here for Rapid Fire News has to do with the game Super Mario Maker.
4877539	4885484	And I'm talking about the original on the Wii U, because as you know, the 3DS and the Wii U's online services, they're going bye-bye in a few weeks.
4885484	4891728	So reminder, those online services will be six feet under in about three weeks.
4891728	4893269	So because of this,
4893829	4899211	There are efforts underway with the original Super Mario Maker to beat every level.
4899211	4905993	Yes, that's right, there's a group called Team 0% that is trying to beat every level in the game, but there is one left.
4905993	4912035	And I don't know, as of the recording of this show, I don't know if it's been done yet, because I feel like the more press that this thing gets,
4912435	4912675	and more!
4935799	4942004	But the creator had to beat it to post it, because remember, that was the thing in Mario Maker was that you had to beat the level in order to post it.
4942004	4948048	So that was how they kind of got around some of the, you know, trolling that otherwise could have happened with the game.
4948048	4949710	So very, very interesting.
4949710	4951191	So there's one level left.
4951191	4956054	I'm sure they'll get it done in, you know, three weeks or whatever the time is left, especially with how many apparently has been played.
4956054	4958957	Like they say, average of like 82 times a person.
4959557	4960977	that are actively trying to beat it.
4960977	4962618	Like over a thousand people are trying.
4962618	4964839	So, yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of streaming and all this stuff.
4964839	4971440	By the way, this will have nothing to do with Mario Maker 2, which was a Switch game and is still available at this point.
4971440	4973741	So this is only going to impact Mario Maker 1.
4973741	4975982	And this is the last one.
4975982	4983244	YYR says that this level comes from someone who created another infamous level that involved precision bomb handling.
4983244	4984804	That one took years to beat.
4984804	4986305	So we will see if Team 0% can do it.
4987865	4991027	Otherwise, they're going to have to rebrand to Team 0.0001%.
4991027	4995350	I'm sorry to say.
4995350	4998532	Anyway.
4998532	5004095	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that might come out sooner than trimming the herbs is beaten.
5004095	5005956	Let's start in the U.S., Loki.
5005956	5006576	Yeah.
5006576	5011339	So this week we have Hi-Fi Rush coming out on PlayStation 5.
5011339	5016182	My gosh, the world is ending because cats and dogs are living together.
5016182	5017143	Mass hysteria.
5018379	5024843	Funny enough, you know, that references perfectly because also this week, you know, the new Ghostbusters movie is out.
5024843	5028085	So, you know, I'm on fire with these puns tonight, Loki.
5028085	5028945	I need to see.
5028945	5029786	I want to see it.
5029786	5031527	Who's going to see it with me?
5031527	5034188	I mean, I'm going to go see it on Friday, my kids for sure.
5034188	5036249	So because we saw the last one, the last one was great.
5036249	5036770	I loved it.
5036770	5037870	I'll see it in a year.
5037870	5040012	I finally saw Barbie like two weeks ago, so.
5040799	5041660	I solely see Barbie.
5041660	5042240	I wanted to see that.
5042240	5046803	My wife saw it without me, you know, and I liked it.
5046803	5050486	There's a lot of really there's only like a couple of things I didn't like, but for the most part, I thought it was brilliant.
5050486	5051947	And Margot Robbie.
5051947	5052587	Perfect.
5052587	5054128	Perfect.
5054128	5067417	Yeah, we have MLB The Show 24 coming out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series A. There's another another studio, a Sony studio now on the games are just everywhere.
5068464	5078072	Speaking of games being everywhere, here's one that I forgot was coming out, and it's a blast from the past, Alone in the Dark on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5078072	5085258	Speaking of, isn't there a movie with a hot bear guy from Stranger Things?
5085258	5086899	His name is in that movie.
5086899	5087980	It's the Sheriff.
5087980	5089962	The Sheriff, yes.
5089962	5090582	David Harbour.
5090582	5091063	David Harbour.
5091063	5092584	Yeah, yeah.
5092584	5094205	Is there another Alone in the Dark?
5094205	5094986	I only remember the
5097779	5099360	Yeah, somebody was talking about that.
5099360	5100641	Yes, I've forgotten his name.
5100641	5102643	I've forgotten his name.
5102643	5104804	The director has left my brain.
5104804	5105925	Oh, Uwe Boll.
5105925	5106285	Uwe Boll.
5106285	5106966	No!
5106966	5108507	Dammit.
5108507	5109068	Nope.
5109068	5109748	You're coming back.
5109748	5111329	Now I have to remember him again.
5111329	5111870	Suffer with me.
5111870	5114852	Suffer with me.
5114852	5116553	My brain is like fully purged.
5116553	5121257	Uwe Boll, ruin movies forever.
5121257	5123338	OK, well, yeah, that's the only Alone Dark I remember.
5123338	5125200	Hey, Loki, remember Blood Rain?
5126991	5129152	Hey Loki, remember the Postal movie?
5143900	5147702	because um and you told him to shove his movies where?
5147702	5165352	I did not um like so this was back with um oh god it was a long time ago obviously it was back when I worked at um that video company and so we interviewed him for our um magazine the industry magazine thing that we went out so like
5166272	5169455	Yes, I got to talk to him about, oh God, what was it?
5169455	5171497	It was... And you were nice, I know it.
5171497	5172838	You could say shit to him.
5172838	5174519	Tunnel, was it Tunnel?
5174519	5176381	Yeah, I was, of course it was nice.
5176381	5180024	Because it was for Tunnel Rats, I think is what it was.
5180024	5181485	I think it was a movie that he made.
5181485	5185649	It actually wasn't based off a video game, but then later made a video game based off of it as well.
5187642	5190245	So yeah, that's a fun bit of trivia right there.
5190245	5195010	They had him here at the local horror con one year, the one year I didn't go because I had a conflict.
5195010	5196071	They had him at the con.
5196071	5196952	Oh, darn.
5196952	5197733	I know.
5197733	5199975	I dodged a bullet with that.
5199975	5201077	So, yeah.
5201077	5203099	I mean, but again, I could have been a consummate professional.
5203099	5208124	Even if I had to run that panel, I would have been like, so let's talk about your movies.
5209497	5211338	Tell me about that creative process.
5211338	5213660	What was your process there?
5213660	5216602	How many drugs you took to come up and think this was a good idea?
5216602	5217783	The German tax write-off?
5217783	5229412	He was, see, he was cutting edge right there because he was manipulating the tax system for movies before Warner Brothers was.
5229412	5233075	But he had to have stolen the idea from Mel Brooks.
5233075	5234456	I mean, it's the plot of the producers.
5234456	5235477	Yeah, that's true.
5236002	5240783	I can't believe that Uwe Boll was ahead of his time.
5240783	5243183	Remember, he got the idea from Mel Brooks.
5243183	5244344	It's been fun.
5244344	5244764	Oops.
5244764	5247124	Don't come back.
5247124	5248284	Okay.
5248284	5251005	Sorry, I was getting something out of my stream deck.
5251005	5254026	What else is making her piece known as well?
5254026	5256926	So that's interesting.
5256926	5258347	What else we have coming out this week?
5258347	5262227	Call of Duty Warzone Mobile for iOS and Android.
5262227	5265188	Final Fantasy XIV for the Xbox Series.
5266228	5270369	Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition on PC.
5270369	5276810	Crimson on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5276810	5282571	Dragon's Dogma 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5282571	5286211	Princess Peach Showtime on Nintendo Switch.
5286211	5287812	Oh, that's this week.
5287812	5288712	Yeah, it's this week.
5288712	5292252	Rise of Ronin on PlayStation 5.
5292252	5294653	And that is it.
5294653	5295093	Alrighty.
5296667	5300889	Well, let's travel to Japan right now and check out the releases coming out over there.
5300889	5312493	So on March 21st on the Nintendo Switch, we have Yuki Yuna, Wayusha de Aru, Hanayui no Kirameke, volumes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
5312493	5313394	That's right.
5313394	5316475	If you want to buy four different volumes of this game, you can.
5316475	5321317	And this is all about, I was curious, like, what the hell game necessitates this many releases?
5321317	5326059	But this is about the six members of the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club.
5326519	5329101	They get engulfed in a mysterious light.
5329101	5336745	And when they come back to consciousness, the world has forestized and is invaded by vertexes.
5336745	5340467	Okay, anyway, each volume is a different story.
5340467	5345090	It's a visual novel, you know, you know what to either you love them, or you're skipping it.
5345090	5347691	You know what you know which category you fall into.
5347691	5350053	Um, Dragon Quest 10 online what?
5350947	5353972	I was going to say, shouldn't they be invaded by vertices?
5353972	5356897	That's the proper plural of vertex.
5356897	5358319	I'll use Google Translate, right?
5359218	5359798	No.
5359798	5363899	But anyway, let's talk about Dragon Quest X online.
5363899	5367180	The all-in-one package also coming out for the Switch.
5367180	5368581	This is something you can't get here.
5368581	5370441	It's versions 1 through 7.
5370441	5374323	It's basically all the expansions they've done for Dragon Quest X. It's just another rebranding of it.
5374323	5380104	So if you have yet to get into this, you can in Japan, but it's still not out here for whatever reason.
5380104	5381525	I don't know why.
5381525	5384946	Also coming out on the Switch in Japan, Lisa, Bundle of Joy.
5385766	5390128	Ambitious Mission, Kemco RPG Selection Vol.
5390128	5391629	6, Azdivine Kimura
5399133	5404056	Alphadia Genesis, Lost Dragon, and Dragon Lapis NBA 2K24 gets a price reduction
5418582	5423145	Oh, also Princess Peach Showtime does release on the 22nd over in Japan.
5423145	5426527	Of course, that would make sense that that is a worldwide release.
5426527	5427628	That was just the Switch.
5427628	5434793	The PlayStation 5 has their own releases, which is pretty much overlapping some of those same ones you heard of.
5434793	5439516	Lisa Bundle of Joy and the NBA 2K24 price reduction.
5439516	5445320	But also in Japan, Dragon's Dogma 2 is on the Switch, as I'm pretty sure it is worldwide.
5447181	5449062	Dragons Dogma 2 is not on the Switch, it's on the PS5.
5449062	5451283	Rise of the Ronin also released on PS5 this week in Japan.
5467349	5471236	I haven't seen too many differences though for the UK, I mean, I'll be honest.
5471236	5472078	On the 20th for
5478533	5481895	For computer, PlayStation Xbox is Alone in the Dark.
5481895	5486517	On the 21st for PlayStation and Xbox is the Inquisitor Deluxe Edition.
5486517	5490818	Also on the 21st is Dungeons 4 Deluxe Edition for the same.
5490818	5495640	On the 22nd, we have for PlayStation, Rise of the Ronin.
5495640	5498982	On PlayStation and Xbox, Dragon's Dogma 2.
5498982	5502323	On Switch, we have Princess Peach Showtime.
5502323	5505224	And on PlayStation and Switch, we have Plate Up.
5505224	5506145	And that will be it.
5507518	5508979	All right.
5508979	5511641	We have just a few more.
5511641	5513843	Actually, no, we don't have any more stories for you.
5513843	5516285	This is where we're wrapping it up pretty much for tonight.
5516285	5518926	I got some last minute stories I can discuss.
5518926	5519767	We'll get to those in a minute.
5519767	5522589	I do want to just quickly mention the listener roundtable as well.
5522589	5524030	We did not have emails this week.
5524030	5526892	I confirmed that with DarkSakura, but you can always send in emails.
5526892	5529214	Participate at orangelandrated.com.
5529214	5532336	We can also take calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5532336	5534578	We're happy to take some calls if anybody wants to give us a call.
5535058	5536639	Build-A-Bear is bringing Bidoof
5565578	5566618	I like Bidoof, finish the story!
5586602	5589525	Shane's favorite Pokemon
5602601	5606263	I think Suikoden V in the short time he was at Konami.
5606263	5607764	And I left it on my gaming week.
5607764	5613968	I forgot to mention it, but the Ayaden Chronicles beta came out, which they're being very like, don't stream it.
5613968	5618671	And I want to say, I read like you're not, they don't even really want you talking about it on social media, but I'm like, fuck that.
5618671	5620492	I paid for that game like six or seven years ago.
5620492	5621913	Of course I'm going to talk about it.
5621913	5627396	And plus I, I'm not going to do story spoilers because I know I'm going to have to replay everything.
5627396	5630558	So I only played the first kind of like prologue
5631058	5633038	We'll call it six months before.
5633038	5635199	Those that have played it will know what I'm talking about.
5635199	5636639	Those that haven't yet.
5636639	5637999	It'll make sense later.
5637999	5640780	I played that portion of the game and I'm into it.
5640780	5645100	I actually thought it was pretty like the pixel inspired graphics.
5645100	5653202	They kind of do a lot of similar stuff to Octopath, but I actually think like the sprites are better looking and the effects and everything.
5653202	5658683	Like it really does feel like you're playing like an old school PlayStation one JRPG, but just like on
5659443	5664826	Steam, in this case, because that's why I'm like, I'm gonna have to replay this all anyway, because I backed it on PlayStation 5.
5664826	5665927	But I enjoyed it.
5665927	5667968	I thought I thought it was neat.
5667968	5669669	And I look forward to playing the full version.
5669669	5680616	So yeah, I didn't Chronicles and it's a real bummer that the you know, guy behind this whole series really passed away because I think this game will get a good reception and he doesn't get to see that and it's really sad.
5680616	5681516	I'm sorry to be a downer.
5681516	5682217	Yeah, it is.
5682217	5684058	It is a bummer because I think the game turned out pretty good.
5684658	5687019	We'll see when the full game releases.
5687019	5687700	It's only a few weeks.
5687700	5693203	I want to say it's mid-April when that game comes out, so it's not too far away.
5693203	5697525	DJ Ranma S says, I kind of want to call in about 90s con and make the host feel old.
5697525	5699666	I was living from your pictures, Ranma.
5699666	5706630	I'd love to hear more about it because it looked totally rad, which I guess would be an 80s thing.
5706630	5707230	90s con.
5707230	5708651	I lived 90s con.
5708651	5708991	I know.
5708991	5711833	Well, does that restaurant still exist in Rancho?
5712296	5714898	No, it's it's not there anymore.
5714898	5717100	Yeah, the 80s restaurant.
5717100	5718841	COVID COVID killed it.
5718841	5719201	Sorry.
5719201	5722044	Yeah, that's not exactly the place you're gonna order from on DoorDash.
5722044	5723244	So that's a bummer.
5723244	5726207	They they were they were made it at best.
5726207	5727528	It was more of the ambiance.
5727528	5728929	And yeah, that's a bummer.
5728929	5729890	All right.
5729890	5733332	We do have someone on the Loki I don't know if you have more, but maybe you'll hold on.
5733332	5734173	No, I don't.
5734173	5737115	Okay, well, we have somebody waiting to talk to us.
5737115	5739016	So let's bring them on the program.
5739016	5739477	Hi there.
5739477	5740518	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
5740518	5740838	Who's this?
5742191	5744993	Uh, hi, this is Aaron, YYR.
5744993	5746514	Hey, YYR, it's great to hear from you.
5746514	5747094	It's been a minute.
5747094	5748796	How have you been?
5748796	5749816	Uh, busy.
5749816	5750577	Real busy.
5750577	5751477	Yeah, I understand.
5751477	5752098	I understand.
5752098	5755140	Life, life gets busy sometimes.
5755140	5767288	Yeah, I, uh, so, uh, I guess if, if you're wondering what I've been up to, my big headline is that I was accepted to the Indie Video Game Showcase at, um,
5768956	5774146	TooManyGames in the Philadelphia area this year for the end of June.
5781729	5793832	So basically what I am now doing is struggling to basically do as much of my super multitasking project before that as possible.
5793832	5802014	Ideally I was hoping to finish the new version and finish the spin-off game, which is not yet started actually.
5804054	5808077	And, well, okay, DJ Ranma S, I see that comment in chat.
5808077	5811639	It's the greater Philadelphia area.
5811639	5818384	It's like a... My California ass doesn't know the fucking difference, so just... It's fine.
5818384	5826749	But yeah, so yeah, the upgraded version of the main game, the spin-off game, and the free-to-play version.
5826749	5829451	So I'm basically rushing to finish all those up.
5829451	5829912	And then,
5830672	5839516	In the midst of all of that, I get an email from Google saying, hey, you remember that Google Play developer account you opened a few years ago?
5839516	5846799	Well, if you don't release something in the next six weeks, we're going to close that because you're not using it.
5846799	5851762	So if you see Sharpshooter Plus come out on Android by March 30th,
5852782	5857463	That means I'm not getting killed on Android.
5857463	5861044	You can't fake it by just doing a version upgrade to something else you'd released on there?
5861044	5862345	Or you haven't released on Android?
5862345	5864826	I have not released anything on Android yet.
5864826	5865386	Oh, that's why.
5865386	5866626	Okay, okay.
5866626	5867846	Got it.
5867846	5872648	And actually, I got Sharpshooter Plus running on an Android tablet in like two days.
5873588	5888865	um so it the game runs but uh i spent a week just trying to figure out how to sign things and create a self-signing certificate and learning how to use key stores and all this other nonsense
5889065	5903969	shit that we always get hung up on any type of development like I love that you're sitting here going the game is fucking done it's all this other stuff that I'm getting hung up like this this is just totally like yeah this is what I would expect you I mean it sucks I'm sorry to hear it but yeah I'm not surprised either
5904502	5913445	I don't even know if leaderboards are going to work, which is kind of crappy considering... Well, yeah, so I'll have to patch that in later.
5913445	5917426	And the other thing that really... Just call it a quadruple A release.
5917426	5918907	You can always patch it in later.
5918907	5920287	Quadruple I release.
5920287	5921868	I for indie.
5921868	5922368	I, I, I, I.
5926576	5946732	I don't know how other people deal with this, but apparently Google's rules for the Google Play Marketplace, exclusive to the Google Play Marketplace, is if any of your apps ask for money, whether it's in-app purchase or to buy it outright,
5947757	5955984	You have to provide an address, a physical address that can be verified.
5955984	5958847	And like hell I'm giving out my home address.
5958847	5962169	So at first, this game may be free.
5963010	5965072	Like, completely free.
5965072	5967714	No ads, no in-app purchase, no nothing.
5967714	5970636	You can't do a mailboxes, etc.
5970636	5971576	type of thing?
5971576	5973278	Or UPS store?
5973278	5980583	I don't know, but at any rate, I don't want to pay for it because I'm not like I'm making any money off of this.
5980583	5988349	So, yeah, until I figure out how to deal with that, it's probably going to be a completely free thing.
5990828	5994853	But believe it or not, that's actually not why I called in.
5994853	5995454	Oh, really?
5995454	5995895	Okay.
5995895	5999319	Well, to what do we owe this treat?
5999319	6001983	I wanted to mention a couple of things that are going on that...
6003294	6006855	that I'm a real big fan of.
6006855	6015759	The first is a Stepmania event called ITL 2024 that began last weekend.
6015759	6020821	It is basically the sequel event to last year's ITL 2023.
6020821	6023582	ITL stands for International Timing League.
6025501	6044630	The group that put this together is the ITC, the International Timing Collective, and basically what it is is a big stepmania event consisting of several hundred stepcharts that actually they start at level 7, like old-scale 7.
6044630	6050212	So, I mean, if you can play 7s, you can try this out.
6050212	6051293	And the...
6052884	6056326	The charts run the gamut, all kinds of tech.
6056326	6073456	You got your crossovers, you got your jackhammers, you've got foot switches, which is when, you know, basically, you know, if you play all the charts correctly, you're supposed to alternate your feet in most cases, but foot switches force you to switch the foot that you're using for the next step.
6073456	6078079	And they, a lot of the chart designers use minds to clue you in as to when this happens.
6079560	6101708	But a lot of these charts are never seen before, they have a lot of tech tricks that will make you think, they're hard to score on, and in fact, the version of StepMania that is used for this, and by the way, features automatic score submissions and all this other fun stuff, it introduces
6102728	6128126	a special fantastic window which is smaller than in the group's fantastic window and the you are scored based on the new scale so uh yeah it's uh it's a serious it's serious business and uh i would say honestly because last year's event really blew up thousands of people participated and basically i would say anyone who still
6134253	6140300	It's a super fun event.
6140300	6143383	It doesn't cost anything, it's StepMania after all.
6143383	6145105	You download the stuff and go.
6145105	6147188	It lives on Groovestats, remember that?
6147788	6150571	Groovestats.com.
6150571	6153033	A bunch of us probably still have accounts there.
6153033	6155875	Even if you haven't logged in in years, they never went anywhere.
6155875	6157937	They don't expire.
6157937	6159758	You can log right into your Groovestats account.
6161235	6164237	Yeah, right?
6164237	6168599	And you can log right into Groovestats and download the pack and jump right in.
6168599	6179765	It's super fun and I would encourage anyone who still has an interest in step games to definitely check it out.
6179765	6181365	All you have to do is go to
6185537	6192322	ITL2024.groovestats.com to get started.
6192322	6193643	Pretty cool.
6193643	6199226	Sadly, I don't have a home dance set up, but you know.
6199226	6201488	I love that it's still going.
6201488	6202328	Pretty cool.
6202328	6204330	And I'll tell you why.
6204330	6206111	It's to help speed up my footwork for ballet.
6209025	6212147	So that I can get used to, because my joint mobility is a lot better.
6212147	6218049	I still have a lot of pain, but I feel a lot better after I exercise or work out or move around.
6218049	6231036	And so I was thinking of using that as part of my warmup to get my legs moving, because I'm apparently going to have a lead role in something coming up.
6231036	6233637	But I'm glad that you brought that up because that's a good incentive.
6234622	6242307	Yeah, if you're looking for charts to play, you could definitely check out the pack.
6242307	6242668	Anything else?
6242668	6245770	I thought you said you might... Is that it or is there something else on your mind?
6245770	6247371	There was one other thing I wanted to mention.
6247371	6248752	Okay, I thought you mentioned something to it.
6248752	6250133	Yeah, what's up?
6250133	6261601	If you dig through your memories, you might remember me plugging Pocket Card Jockey on 3DS because it is a freaking amazing game.
6261601	6261841	Well,
6263228	6270250	A sequel had come out about a year ago, but it was locked behind the Apple Arcade subscription.
6270250	6272750	Until recently.
6272750	6276911	The game is now available for outright purchase on Nintendo Switch.
6276911	6287173	This new version is called Pocket Card Jockey Ride On, and it is basically a remake of the original game, except that it's a heck of a lot prettier.
6287173	6289794	All the horse racing is rendered in full 3D now.
6292520	6302865	Yeah, basically, it's just a... If Derby Owners Club and Tripeak Solitaire had a baby, that's pocket card jockey.
6302865	6309088	And it's... Yes, it was announced in a partner direct, and I bought it the very next day.
6311264	6322030	And yeah, it has silly writing, a lot of kooky characters, and it's basically, yeah, amazing.
6322030	6332556	And it has the whole thing with Derby Owners Club where, you know, you raise a horse, it has its career, it retires, it goes to the farm, and then... It becomes glue.
6333877	6348040	No, that's when you pair it with your other retired horses, make babies, and then their kids run the races and do even better because they get superpowers and other properties from their parents.
6348040	6350601	So this is a game you can play forever.
6350601	6353421	Do they turn into pandas?
6353421	6354341	They don't.
6354341	6356862	However, there is a horse that wears a cat mask.
6357869	6359450	Okay, I'm down.
6359450	6361252	You should play it and name your first horse Politary.
6386630	6389511	How much does this game cost?
6389511	6390952	It was in the $10 range.
6390952	6392412	I don't actually remember.
6392412	6393773	I think it was $10 or $12.
6393773	6396254	Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
6396254	6396734	What?
6396734	6399655	Give me $10.
6399655	6400816	Bitch, I'm poor.
6400816	6403477	My birthday is the one coming up.
6403477	6408259	I will mention, though, the i-thing version is still on Apple Arcade.
6408259	6412140	So if you do have an active Apple Arcade subscription, feel free to jump in at any time.
6415171	6417573	Well, YYR, it is always a delight to hear from you.
6417573	6420455	Please let us know if you do get that game released on Android.
6420455	6427219	We'll make sure we give you a shout out because we already had I saw Bobby in chat was like, I'm happy to buy it to help support and I, I don't have an Android device.
6427219	6430462	Oh, but you can buy it for $0 and 0 cents.
6430462	6432163	Alan has an Android phone.
6432163	6434504	I'll make him purchase it as well.
6434504	6442850	So you know, whether it's I will say whatever, being sharpshooter, it will play better on a tablet than on a phone.
6442850	6443731	But he's got one of those.
6445004	6447025	Ah, well, that's great.
6447025	6454289	And now I will get back to trying to get as many badges as possible from Nintendo Badge Arcade while I still can.
6454289	6455550	Yes.
6455550	6462653	Which is very difficult now because you can't buy plays anymore because the store is closed.
6462653	6470437	And so you have to rely on the free plays that you can earn from the training claw.
6470437	6471118	And by the way,
6472116	6475800	For about a year now, the training claw has been the same every day.
6493610	6494651	It stinks.
6494651	6499175	I honestly, I still prefer traveling with my 3DS over my Switch.
6499175	6500416	Okay, stop it.
6500416	6502918	I'm gonna shut that soundboard down.
6502918	6505140	Alright.
6505140	6506441	YYR, thank you so much for calling in.
6506441	6507021	I appreciate it.
6507021	6508663	It's always a delight to hear from you.
6508663	6509583	Hey, have a great week.
6509583	6510824	Thanks for the show as always.
6510824	6511205	Of course.
6511205	6511585	Take care, buddy.
6511585	6513246	We like having you around.
6513246	6513927	Yay.
6513927	6515488	Good luck.
6515488	6515909	Thanks.
6515909	6516749	See you later.
6516749	6517770	Bye.
6517770	6520032	It's always a delight to hear from YYR.
6520032	6520592	It's fine.
6520592	6521493	It really is.
6521493	6522114	It really is.
6522987	6524168	Orange Lounge Radio
6545553	6546013	Good.
6546013	6548874	Just so you know, you twisted my arm.
6548874	6549455	That's what you did.
6549455	6550215	You twisted my arm.
6550215	6554216	Oh, you you're even wearing your shirt from the 90s con, aren't you?
6554216	6554476	Yes.
6554476	6555457	I want to hear about this.
6555457	6557158	I want to hear about this.
6557158	6568002	I just as I was telling mostly everyone out of the 20 plus years of conventions I have gone to, this is the first time I spent the most amount of money on.
6568002	6569082	And I ain't talking hotel room.
6569082	6571403	I'm talking just straight up swag and stuff.
6571403	6573724	Did you actually like pay for selfies and all that stuff, too?
6574659	6576620	Uh oh, uh oh, what's that?
6576620	6577501	Is that an autograph?
6577501	6579522	I can't tell what it is.
6579522	6581524	Topanga, get out!
6581524	6585867	Yes, I got so emotional over this and I'll get into that in just a minute.
6585867	6589229	So many straight boys crushed on her hard at some point.
6589229	6591290	That's, yeah.
6591290	6591971	It's funny.
6591971	6599456	I've seen those memes where they say your first crush was Kelly Kapowski and a bunch of us were like, yeah, no, it was not.
6602185	6602825	No, Topanga.
6602825	6606348	I know Topanga was popular, for sure.
6606348	6609670	For me, it was Topanga and Kimmy Gibbler.
6609670	6609970	Right.
6609970	6611751	Anyway, enough about the crushes.
6611751	6613313	How was the con?
6613313	6614213	It was great.
6614213	6617055	I actually had a great time.
6617055	6625581	So basically, it's a three-day convention of basically the 90 stars of shows such as Boy Meets World,
6627790	6649986	step-by-step basically like the TGI Friday lineups and other shows like 7th Heaven and so forth and they had like hour-long panels talking about the different shows and so forth I didn't go Friday because of work so I figured I go Saturday I go up grab some autographs and go home I forgot what it was like to wait on those long long lines of autographs
6651011	6656676	But since the majority of the people were our age, there was not much in the ways of dillying and dallying.
6656676	6658997	So the lines went pretty smooth.
6658997	6662360	So I really couldn't complain about that.
6662360	6672448	Now, I thought I saw like from the pictures you were posting, because I saw, you know, some of your stuff on on social media and it wasn't just, you know, I thought I saw like an arcade room set up with 90s arcadias.
6672448	6676611	So tell me like the gaming since I guess it's I guess it has to be a gaming show sometimes.
6676611	6677712	Tell me about some of the gaming stuff.
6680370	6681650	That's not much to tell.
6681650	6686392	But seriously, the arcade, there was three pinball machines.
6686392	6687932	Oh, three pinball machines?
6687932	6689273	Oh, never mind.
6689273	6693254	Three pinball machines and like three or four arcade machines.
6693254	6699896	It was TMNT 1, The Simpsons, Mortal Kombat, and a Super Mario Bros.
6699896	6700576	arcade machine.
6701016	6720462	for a 90s lineup that's pretty solid i would say just switch out the mario machine with a iron man stewart super off-road machine and there you go you have your quintessential pizza parlor lineup or put in a final fight a street fighter captain america the avengers drop a gauntlet machine in there you know
6721499	6725661	Maybe this, well it sounds like the con was probably a success, so they'll probably come back next year, right?
6725661	6729604	Well, this is their second, this is actually their third or fourth 90s con.
6729604	6733846	I've heard of this con before, do they have it on the West Coast too?
6733846	6739649	Because I swear, maybe they just, this is a thing they do now, is these memory cons.
6739649	6748014	I've never seen them advertised on the West Coast, but they have it in Connecticut around this time of the year, and then around September, I think, they have it in Florida.
6748920	6749720	So, okay.
6749720	6750040	Okay.
6750040	6750881	I, okay.
6750881	6765566	I definitely heard about the Florida one because also, um, so the cruise, the Star Trek cruise, the, the same production company that does the Star Trek cruise the week after we get back every year has always been their next theme cruise, which is the eighties cruise.
6765566	6768086	And they always go out with eighties bands.
6768086	6772768	So like, you know, I don't remember who they had this year, but I know they get the old MTV VJs and all that stuff.
6772768	6775569	And this year they're starting the nineties cruise.
6776409	6781130	So they're gonna have the 90s cruise, and that is, I think, paired with the Comic-Con cruise that they're also starting.
6781130	6783051	They're starting a Comic-Con cruise.
6783051	6788993	Because I think George Takei, for whatever reason, is doing that cruise, but not the Star Trek cruise, which is whatever.
6788993	6790973	And I think they're both shorter cruises.
6790973	6794334	I think they're only five-day cruises as opposed to seven.
6794334	6803297	But still, I find that interesting that the 90s and 80s retro stuff is all the rage.
6803297	6804858	But I get it.
6804858	6805278	I get it.
6805278	6805618	It's fun.
6806823	6807544	Definitely.
6807544	6810886	Yeah, the 90s Cruise has Lisa Loeb.
6810886	6812027	I was like, I love her.
6812027	6813328	And I do.
6813328	6814949	Exactly.
6814949	6820653	I will say because of this con the next for the next two days, I'm at work.
6820653	6824556	I'll be listening to nothing but 90s theme songs and music.
6824556	6825257	All of that.
6825257	6827038	And I will be perfectly OK with that.
6827038	6830541	But some Lisa Loeb in there, you know, the thing you want to I want to talk about her for a minute.
6832227	6839312	I want to know what she's eating and drinking because that woman has not aged a fucking day.
6839312	6840874	Who her surgeon is?
6840874	6841074	What?
6842267	6845689	You've seen my photos, you've seen Danielle Fischel, okay?
6845689	6846109	Yeah, I know.
6846109	6847229	She still looks like she's 15!
6847229	6853472	I know, they're, the cosmetic things they can do to these things, amazing.
6853472	6857834	According to Bon Appetit, a lot of kale, almond butter, chocolate chips, and protein.
6857834	6860175	Okay, good to know, good to know.
6860175	6862636	Lisa Loeb strikes me as somebody who eats healthy.
6862636	6864377	She does, yeah.
6864377	6864937	So, good for her.
6867169	6868529	It's all about the kale.
6868529	6872430	I eat kale every day and kale keeps me really skinny.
6872430	6878452	So if you eat your kale every day, you too can be the picture of perfect health.
6878452	6884433	I never want to hear the uwu kale voice ever again in my life.
6884433	6889114	I will say I eat kale weekly because of the free lunches at work.
6889114	6890435	It just keeps me regulated.
6890435	6891555	That's the opposite.
6891555	6892075	You know what?
6893476	6900261	I wish that I had kale and everything at work, but they tend to either put peppers and stuff or cilantro and stuff or both.
6900261	6906246	And I'm like, you don't put cilantro on a burger.
6906246	6911930	Sounds good to me, but I know I know it's a very divisive, especially cilantro does not taste like soap to me.
6911930	6913011	It tastes very pleasant.
6913011	6915012	Well, it doesn't taste like soap to me either.
6915012	6917174	It tastes like somebody's front lawn.
6917174	6919316	Oh, wow.
6919316	6919476	Ouch.
6921627	6924530	Anyway, Ranma, I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the 90s con.
6924530	6925771	That sounds like a blast.
6925771	6929355	Yeah, I'm happy there's more than just anime cons and stuff at this point.
6929355	6934720	Not to knock the anime cons, but I think this is a great thing to expand into for the con circuit.
6935476	6941080	But Rob, you do have a valid point, because I mean, there are Doctor Who conventions as well.
6941080	6942601	I mean, they just had in L.A.
6942601	6943942	the, what do they call it?
6943942	6944542	Dang it.
6944542	6945583	Regeneration Who?
6945583	6946283	No.
6946283	6947484	Oh, well, maybe there's that one, too.
6947484	6949766	There's one on the West Coast they just had.
6949766	6950466	It's huge.
6950466	6951247	I can't remember the name of it.
6951247	6952147	Dang it.
6952147	6953268	Somebody in chat will yell it out.
6953268	6955649	One of the one of the Whovians.
6955649	6957491	But there was some cosplayers.
6957491	6963875	I mean, you had a couple of Disney princesses running around because Jodie Benson and Laura Larkin.
6964921	6966222	Linda Larkin was were there.
6966222	6975925	So and I had to get a special autograph from Jody Benson because a friend of mine took his now wife on their very first date, which was- Thank you, PodCulture.
6975925	6976706	Gallifrey One.
6976706	6977226	That's it.
6977226	6979187	Gallifrey One.
6979187	6982148	So she signed on art that he did.
6982148	6983828	Happy anniversary to the two of them.
6983828	6987390	So I got to especially frame that and ship it to them.
6987390	6989170	So it's a surprise for his wife.
6989170	6990451	So nice.
6995833	7002299	They had like the usual stuff like in the dealers hall you find at most conventions and end up buying a couple more pops.
7002299	7006062	Mako didn't have Daria so you know I had to add that to her collection because it makes sense.
7006062	7007144	Of course Daria.
7007144	7009125	I need a Daria!
7009125	7014751	Alright I tell you what next time I see one I'll be at a con this week and I'll pick it up and send it to you.
7014751	7015872	I love you forever.
7015872	7016072	I know.
7016906	7025310	But like I said, this pop, the Topanga one, is like the nexus of my collection.
7025310	7041758	Only because, not just the fact that us guys, straight guys, had like the biggest crush on her, the way her character was on the show, it kind of put in, gave me the direction of a type of person, type of woman I'd like to date.
7042543	7046488	Someone that's nerdy, quirky, but it just opened my eyes to that.
7046488	7048091	So it helped.
7048091	7057583	So that's what and I was telling her that and I'm just trying not to like cry, but you know, but she she thought it was like a really amazing story.
7057583	7058284	So there's that.
7059208	7070402	And when I was talking to Jodi Sweetin, I gave her a Pikachu lanyard because I discovered on one of our anime jam sessions, we were talking about one of the voice actresses.
7070402	7075549	Ikui Otani, the voice of Pikachu, is the voice of Stephanie Tanner in Full House.
7075549	7076230	Oh, how funny.
7077265	7078666	Yeah, that I knew.
7078666	7085872	She knew that and we spent like a good five minutes talking about Pokemon when they went to Japan to do the pressers for Fuller House and whatnot.
7085872	7086353	I met her.
7086353	7087794	I saw this picture on my Facebook.
7087794	7093939	I met Jodie Sweetin at a con, a comic con, just a generic like wonder, wonder con, in Reno, Nevada.
7093939	7095580	I remember seeing that picture.
7095580	7097622	I was like, you lucky son of a bitch.
7097622	7100824	I went to Reno with a, unfortunately, ex-friend of mine.
7100824	7104528	And we had a great weekend at the, because it was, it was a very Reno weekend.
7105508	7111112	Um, yeah, so it was a good con, despite the fact that the memories are a little tainted now.
7111112	7113193	But all the celebrities I met, it was a lot of fun.
7113193	7115635	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7115635	7116896	The good always outweighs the bad.
7116896	7117256	That's right.
7117256	7117796	That's right.
7117796	7118437	You remember?
7118437	7119398	You remember the moment?
7119398	7119998	Not?
7119998	7120338	Yeah.
7120338	7121439	Anyway.
7121439	7125662	Well, Ranma, I will always... I'm downloading this clip and adding it to my voice reel.
7125662	7128944	I will always remember these nice moments where you call in and chat with us.
7128944	7130225	I appreciate it.
7130225	7134468	I hope folks will check out Anime Jam Session on Tuesday, because I'm sure you'll be talking more about the con.
7135288	7136729	Good times.
7136729	7139129	Ronshon, what are you doing Friday?
7139129	7140830	I will be at a convention Friday.
7140830	7141450	Of course.
7141450	7142370	Where are you going this weekend?
7142370	7143411	Damn.
7143411	7144371	That's right.
7144371	7145652	I will be at Zenkai Con.
7145652	7150333	Anime Jam Session kicks off their convention season by going out into the Amish country.
7150333	7151133	Yeah, Zenkai Con.
7151133	7152434	I've heard you talk about that one before.
7152434	7153794	Bring back a quilt.
7153794	7154575	I'm kidding.
7154575	7155335	Bring back some butter.
7155335	7158836	Don't tempt me because I will.
7158836	7159816	Right.
7159816	7161517	You know how much those quilts are though?
7162779	7163119	Most Triumphant!
7163119	7163179	Bye.
7190333	7191534	All right.
7191534	7193215	With that, Ranma is great.

7238522	7238742	All right.
7238742	7242024	Anyway, uh, Oh, I was gonna say on the Jeff Keighley story.
7242024	7243805	I saw that he was pitching.
7243805	7246746	Was it some sort of gamer smell thing?
7246746	7249587	It's like a machine that makes smells for your games.
7249587	7252028	No, that that never worked.
7252028	7254449	No, that did not work in movies.
7254449	7255630	It's not gonna except one.
7255630	7258291	There was a John Waters movie that used it.
7258291	7259952	To this day.
7259952	7261433	It wasn't Pink Flamingos.
7261433	7263854	It was one of the other ones he did before hairspray.
7264844	7267406	Was it Female Trouble that used it?
7267406	7272250	No, it was the one with Mink Stole and Tab Hunter.
7272250	7274591	What's that fucking movie?
7274591	7276333	Now it's gonna bother me.
7276333	7278674	I love Mink Stole.
7278674	7281817	Well, every movie of his had Mink Stole.
7281817	7283178	I just said I love her.
7283178	7286960	I know.
7286960	7289823	Dang it, I can't remember.
7289823	7291444	Polyester, that was the movie.
7292731	7294672	I had the card.
7294672	7295472	I had to look it up.
7295472	7299654	Anyway, it was a bad idea in movies, it's a bad idea in games.
7299654	7311178	The only, I will say this, the only movie, the only movie, besides Polyester, because that's kind of joking anyway, the only movie where the smell really does enhance the experience is Soarin' Over California.
7313773	7321415	And we all here know that it don't smell like that in real life.
7321415	7326316	It smells like shit because of fertilizer and body sweat.
7326316	7327016	Did you see the clip?
7327016	7333898	Apparently, so, you know, a few years ago they changed Soarin' Over California to Soarin' Over the World, which is worse, by the way.
7333898	7338879	But Soarin' Over California is back during the Food and Wine Festival.
7339281	7341022	Patrick Warburton Patrick Warburton
7360777	7361758	Anyway, all right.
7361758	7363879	Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
7363879	7366601	Thank you so much, as always, for tuning in and supporting our show.
7366601	7368082	We appreciate it.
7368082	7370925	Hey, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, help us tell a friend.
7370925	7375228	Spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.
7375228	7376269	So tell a friend.
7376269	7383194	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever you heard this, that goes an awful long way as well, and we appreciate it.
7383194	7386796	We hope you all have a great week gaming, whatever you decide to play this week.
7386796	7388538	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
7389198	7396324	Keep in mind, in four more episodes, we're going to hit a historic, it's literally a historic landmark in podcasting, which is weird to think about.
7396324	7401007	But no other weekly video game podcast has hit 1000 episodes.
7402600	7404862	And so that's, um, pretty wild.
7404862	7406623	So I'm really excited about that.
7406623	7406983	Yeah.
7406983	7408284	Pretty, pretty special.
7408284	7410025	So, uh, excited about that.
7410025	7411086	So, all right.
7411086	7414968	Um, anyway, uh, let's get around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap it up for the night.
7414968	7419451	DarkSakura, I imagine you are back to streaming Dead by Delight tonight.
7419451	7423134	Um, which I've, I've heard good things about the unknown.
7423134	7426216	Uh, apparently it's the best original killer in a while, some are saying.
7426216	7428457	It's actually kind of fun to play against.
7429418	7435365	It's so crazy that they took that awful, awful Wonka event and put something out of it, you know?
7435365	7437808	The unknown was like, who's this character?
7437808	7439430	And now, now it's in a game.
7439430	7441072	Now he's known.
7441072	7442494	But no one knows what it is.
7442494	7444597	And then Gothmeg.
7444597	7446179	So now there's Boonmeg and Gothmeg.
7447250	7450471	No, well, yeah, but they're but they're also besties.
7450471	7453873	But we of course, everyone knows that they're secretly in lesbians with each other.
7453873	7454273	All right.
7454273	7458715	Well, have fun playing Dead by Daylight.
7458715	7460716	We'll be tuning in in a little bit here.
7460716	7463677	But do you have a final thought for us tonight?
7463677	7465598	I'm going to try to adapt this motherfucker.
7465598	7465878	All right.
7465878	7466578	You got this.
7466578	7467558	You can do it.
7467558	7468299	Later, taters.
7468299	7468439	Bye.
7468439	7468679	Bye.
7468679	7471180	All right, Loki, your final thought tonight.
7472762	7474164	I got a lot of work to do.
7474164	7476469	I got to get that theme park going.
7476469	7478032	Sounds good.
7478032	7479394	Keep taking a long time.
7480592	7481692	Final Fantasy VII Rebirth soon!
