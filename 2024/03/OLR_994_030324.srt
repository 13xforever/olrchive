1
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:10,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids these days.

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in my day, we didn't have the world's information in our hands at all times.

3
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:19,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We only had to deal with bomb drills and sometimes threats, and have our friend come to our car in the high school parking lot and tell us a plane hit the World Trade Center.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:27,594
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have to deal with doxing, swatting, and even greater threat of school shootings, nor being bullied for not having rare or expensive Fortnite skins.

5
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,275
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the We Live In A Society intro.

6
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:34,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about kids these days and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, this episode is gonna be dark.

9
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everybody out there on the internet.

10
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:47,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:00:50,144 --> 00:01:00,348
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live and back after a week off once again with episode number 994 of our show tonight for March the 3rd of 2024.

13
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm feeling refreshed and relaxed after being gone on a cruise last week.

14
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:15,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm back here tonight to talk about video games with you all with my pals that join me every week, weekend and week out.

15
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:19,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Sup?

17
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:20,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Sup?

18
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,159
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

20
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all right.

21
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:29,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually threw out my back last week.

22
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:34,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been on a kind of semi reclining rest.

23
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:37,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually started feeling better.

24
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:43,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been able to get back to doing at least like some of my PT stuff for my back physical therapy.

25
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:47,070
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've become addicted to a game I'll tell you about in a bit.

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, can't wait to hear.

27
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:52,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you're able to make the most of the OLR not happening last week.

28
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:54,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that wasn't the same time you threw out your back and you were able to enjoy yourself.

29
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:56,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That was right after I threw out my back.

30
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:57,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, well.

31
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:01,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least, hey, it gave you an opportunity to rest up for the night, I guess.

32
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's also check in with the one and only Techmaster Loki.

33
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:05,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

34
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:06,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

35
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you enjoy a week off, Loki?

36
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:11,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it was a week off.

37
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:41,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not great internet is kind of weird like in my stateroom I don't know if it was because of where we were located on the boat or whatever it did not work very well it was very hard for very slow like I could get internet but it was crappy but when I was out and about especially

38
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:50,552
[SPEAKER_03]: on the sun deck, you know, deck 11, which, you know, you're outside at that point, it worked great, which I mean, of course, satellite data, there's a lot to be said about that.

39
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But But of course, it's not my phone directly on the satellite.

40
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:57,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, but for whatever reason, it worked outdoors, much better than did in my stateroom.

41
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's I saw a push notification come in.

42
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, yeah, Loki is going to be live today.

43
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:07,598
[SPEAKER_03]: But sorry, I didn't try to watch because on demand video is a lot for cruise ship.

44
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:07,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

45
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:08,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine.

46
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

47
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you have a good stream?

48
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was all right.

49
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Took down trees.

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun, fun.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says it's Starlink on Royal Caribbean.

53
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:23,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It is and I I did not realize that because they call it something else.

54
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:26,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't realize that until after I'd already bought it.

55
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:26,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like,

56
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:32,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't believe I gave that guy's company any money at all.

57
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:43,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't really put a price on being able to access the blink cameras and get pictures of your cats whenever you need them, which is the actual reason why we get internet on the cruise ship.

58
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:47,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know there's some people out there that would say, why do you need internet on a cruise ship?

59
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on vacation, stay off the internet.

60
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, we need the internet to check in on cats.

61
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,776
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, that is it.

62
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:54,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So

63
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's needed.

64
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,792
[SPEAKER_03]: But thankfully, technology will allow you to do that.

65
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:06,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, I hope everybody had a great week off and had some good gaming.

66
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's been a lot of big stuff that's come out in the last couple weeks, especially Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk about our gaming weeks in just a moment.

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I will talk more about my cruise as well.

69
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:18,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Bobby Blackwolf teased a story on last week's show.

70
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:20,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if my co-hosts know what happened, but I will share kind of a

71
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,725
[SPEAKER_03]: a pretty deep thing that happened on the cruise this last week.

72
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about that during gaming weeks.

73
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:39,772
[SPEAKER_03]: But since this is a video game podcast, let's get into the actual gaming news, which unfortunately, this this is the broken record story that just won't go away as much as we want it to.

74
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:47,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki, would you mind taking the reins here and telling us about another really unfortunate situation this week to start us off?

75
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:56,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, so Sony is reducing their staff by about 900 people or 8% of their workforce.

76
00:04:56,736 --> 00:05:04,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this was announced by Jim Ryan, um, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.

77
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,521
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to, uh, also as a result of that, multiple games have been canceled as well.

78
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those like,

79
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:19,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of them were like live service games and some we've already kind of heard about that were being canceled.

80
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:25,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, the I think it was the Last of Us live service game was one of them.

81
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:33,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember some of the other ones, but a lot of the ones I heard were like live service type of games.

82
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they go from like they had said 10 live service games at one point?

83
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:37,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're like five.

84
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:38,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that being a thing.

85
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:39,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

86
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:39,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

87
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:44,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard about these layoffs is that they were going to reduce the number of those games.

88
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:44,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

89
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:49,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what was it also?

90
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, London Studio, I know, was affected by that as well.

91
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they closed the whole studio down, if I remember correctly.

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,422
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that sucks.

93
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:02,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guarantee this is not going to be the last.

94
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:03,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just seems to be the trend.

95
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:08,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all these gaming companies laying off a bunch of people.

96
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, you have the other side of that, which we'll get into later.

97
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:18,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of these gaming companies have really talented people, and they go on to form their own independent studios that do great things.

98
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:27,873
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not going to be as much as I've tried to say that as a, you know, that sometimes out of these crappy situations come diamonds.

99
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:33,136
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality is that's not going to be not everybody's in a situation to be able to make their dream indie game.

100
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:37,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just not going to be the reality for a lot of people.

101
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:43,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, some people are going to leave more than some people are going to end up leaving the gaming industry and going into, I don't know, banking.

102
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft Layoffs

103
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:17,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And I seem to remember that, you know, we heard that the federal government was going to come after Microsoft for that because, well, you said in your Activision Blizzard acquisition, remember, the government still wants to stop the Activision Blizzard acquisition by Microsoft.

104
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too late, isn't it?

105
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

106
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But they still want to stop it at this point.

107
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:31,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they really want to, like, stop things from merging that have merged like already after a long period of time, can we like

108
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.

109
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:50,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the government to go after the Willy Wonka experience too.

110
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care that that was in Europe.

111
00:07:53,002 --> 00:08:01,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, you laugh, but I do think the government needs to do something about the AI ads misrepresenting.

112
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:05,392
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't seen the meme about the Wonka experience, it's everywhere right now.

113
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so big I even read about it on Blue Sky.

114
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:18,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even have to be like an AI ad, it just, it's just, the AI part is not even necessarily a part of it, aside from like, it just like, yeah, but it's false advertising.

115
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:23,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Things get misrepresented all the time, but AI makes it easier to falsely advertise.

116
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:37,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I very recently on BlueSky and the TWAT site posted a video from the Wall Street Journal on how to spot AI content, video content.

117
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, AI video content.

118
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

119
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:48,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I always feel like it's referring back to the the new Sage thing that's being put out by the ChatGTP people.

120
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I always still feel like I can tell.

121
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done a lot with video, though, to be honest.

122
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:56,126
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least the pictures, I feel like it's it's odd.

123
00:08:56,126 --> 00:09:02,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that really annoys me is that on Facebook all the time, people do this shit on Facebook for clout reposts.

124
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works because I see my friends doing it.

125
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,472
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I just saw one today that was like,

126
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:16,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a picture of a pretend Mummy 4 poster, like another Mummy movie with Brendan Fraser, which I think a lot of us would like to see.

127
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:22,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they've actually confirmed one or not, but this site is posting the poster like it's the real poster.

128
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:28,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that is happening, I guarantee you they haven't shot a single frame of it, nor they've taken a promo photo.

129
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:33,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a ton of those, a ton of those where they will fake AI movie posters.

130
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:36,352
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so infuriating that like people

131
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:39,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and it's also sad that people fall for it constantly.

132
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I tried to go back to Facebook and it didn't last.

133
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It lasted like three weeks.

134
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:46,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly, I don't blame you.

135
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot on social media that's irritating.

136
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, we're digressing a little bit from what the story is about the layoffs.

137
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was talking about Microsoft and, you know, how the government was going to, you know, use this as additional ammo in their campaign.

138
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually kind of think

139
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:10,599
[SPEAKER_03]: This PlayStation thing now kind of ends that argument because now Microsoft can simply point and say our biggest competitor in this space has done the same thing.

140
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,501
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an industry epidemic, not something as a result of the buyout.

141
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the government's case is done with that.

142
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:18,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

143
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:34,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo

144
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:56,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So far in this wave, we're not hearing anything.

145
00:10:56,717 --> 00:11:14,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course you you can't help but think when presented with you can't help but think of Satoru Iwata when he was with us and how he took the pay cut and the other executives took the pay cut because the Wii U underperformed and they did the pay cut as opposed to doing layoffs.

146
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:20,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's hard not to have that be front of mind in light of everything that's going on right now.

147
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:41,992
[SPEAKER_03]: and yes to acknowledge what's being said in chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show E3VL says Nintendo work culture is different especially in Japan pay cut is normal in Japanese culture yes but unfortunately as of now

148
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:48,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say as of now because I think there's a lot of people getting pissed off about this.

149
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:52,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not be a thing in the next few years, but I think this will be a thing in our lifetime.

150
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:53,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a thing in American culture.

151
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you're going to hear more thing.

152
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:59,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're really starting to see a push for a lot of people are sick and tired of it.

153
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:10,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to hear a push for things like maximum wage, and you know, severely taxing those that profit off of these systems that I there's a whole other soapbox for that.

154
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:12,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of podcasts talking about that.

155
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:18,309
[SPEAKER_03]: But the those tea leaves and everything reading that will absolutely trickle down into the gaming industry.

156
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:48,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at how much Bobby Kotick, who had a hand in ruining this industry, look at how much he walked away with and tell me that the vast majority of, I'm gonna say decent gamers, meaning people that don't, you know, just shitpost on Twitter all day and all this stuff, the massive bulk of decent gamers aren't in some way pissed off and see the injustice in Bobby, or Bobby Kotick, I almost said Bobby Blackwolf, I'm sorry, Bobby, but I was reading chat.

157
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:53,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Kotick walking away with all that money.

158
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf deserves a raise for the record.

159
00:12:55,425 --> 00:13:01,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be very clear on the difference between the two Bobbies.

160
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:15,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf, though, does plan this was the comment I was reading that caused me to almost say his name in place of the other Bobby saying Sony didn't lay off any of their Japanese employees, only their US, UK and Europe employees.

161
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:16,594
[SPEAKER_03]: That is interesting.

162
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:22,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to that for a minute because I find the Sony changes in Europe very interesting.

163
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:26,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of us are sitting here looking at all this news that's happening going, why?

164
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:28,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

165
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:31,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the this is the big question, right?

166
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:35,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we had all the answers to this, maybe we could in some way stop this.

167
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:36,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But why?

168
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:44,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly I'm looking at like Sony London, knowing that they did a lot with VR.

169
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:51,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I am I incorrect in thinking pretty much all the first party Sony VR stuff came out of Sony London?

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless maybe I know there was a few things at least that came out of Sony London for VR, even on the original PlayStation VR.

171
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:02,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of some of the other like conceptual things, um, came out of a different zoo.

172
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for some, I think Sony London was pretty heavily involved with that.

173
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, again, I'm trying not to read too much into it, but I can't help but feel like Sony is not really talking about PSVR 2.

174
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

175
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:21,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always said from the beginning, it's, you know, it's a nice piece of tech,

176
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:25,267
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't have the must-have game.

177
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:29,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the fun factor to justify the prize.

178
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:34,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear that there's a possibility that they're going to try to get that to work with PC as well.

179
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,378
[SPEAKER_03]: That's huge.

180
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:38,041
[SPEAKER_03]: If that happens, that would be amazing.

181
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,065
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be amazing and that's how they can save that really good tech.

182
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:42,302
[SPEAKER_03]: is

183
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a lot of factors.

184
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:27,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some could say COVID plays into it and I think maybe people projected a larger space for games and that, you know, being online together type of thing in COVID and everything that happened in 2020.

185
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think maybe it lost sight of the fact that most people wanted to go back to the way it was before.

186
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's always going to still be people that, you know, are thrilled about how tech, well, I'm wording this poorly because of course, we're all thrilled that technology allows us to, you know, connect across great distances and all that.

187
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:49,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way Zoom's taken off, it's not just for, you know, nerds anymore and all that stuff and comparable platforms.

188
00:15:49,156 --> 00:16:02,424
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the gaming industry may have thought there was going to be a bigger space for online games that doesn't really exist because people are, for better or for worse, whatever you want to call it, going back to normal at this point.

189
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:13,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and especially with the CDC recommendations this week change, you know, really, we're just all over COVID at this point as a society, and it's going back to the way it was.

190
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:19,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I think people's spending habits are reflecting that, but I don't think that's the sole thing to blame either.

191
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's really to blame.

192
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:28,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I think every game thinks it can be Pokemon Go.

193
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:28,575
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

194
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Every game thinks it can be Pokemon Go.

195
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Every CEO, every game developer, every person that's trying to make a game, every games as a service, everything is trying to be Pokemon Go.

196
00:16:42,954 --> 00:16:50,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it, you can say what you will about Pokemon Go specifically, but I don't want you to think that specifically.

197
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:57,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using that as the everybody knows that example type of massive market appeal type of game.

198
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:06,463
[SPEAKER_03]: that was able to drive the types of microtransactions that people are willing to pay.

199
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:13,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And because people are willing to pay it in a game like Pokemon Go and a very specific subset of other games.

200
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:22,542
[SPEAKER_03]: people are trying to slap that constantly print the money mechanic of Pokemon Go into every game.

201
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we know that.

202
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:28,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen the explosion of games as a service and battle passes in games.

203
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:29,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they need it?

204
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:38,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Diablo four and you know, other, other types of, you know, DLC and cosmetic things that are ridiculous, ridiculously priced and so forth.

205
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

206
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:41,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Niantic NBA All World

207
00:17:56,377 --> 00:18:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: because they thought people would want to do the Pokemon Go model in the NBA thing, and I'll tell you why that game fucking sucked.

208
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say this as somebody who loves AR gaming and does an awful lot of it.

209
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:12,671
[SPEAKER_03]: NBA All-World fucking sucked because at its core, it was a really shitty

210
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:15,555
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

211
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:56,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's also more of the reason, too, why they should be, you know, well, first off, not green lighting all of these live service games, because, you know, like Pokemon Go, that takes up a certain amount of time.

212
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you cannot play.

213
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, usually you're not playing multiple games at the same time.

214
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:10,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, passively, maybe you can, but like actively playing these games, you only have time to play maybe one or two of them or something like that.

215
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,621
[SPEAKER_02]: create 10 new live service games.

216
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony, like you have a live service game, Destiny.

217
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:22,506
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just cannibalizing yourself at this point.

218
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:25,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're obviously they're not all going to be successful.

219
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:31,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if history shows us recently, even most of them are not.

220
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:32,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them are crap.

221
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:35,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, maybe don't do that.

222
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:45,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some really shitty calls happening in the gaming industry at the top levels of what games should we be making.

223
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:53,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And at its core, I think what's driving a lot of these layoffs is the realization of maybe we shouldn't be making these games.

224
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:53,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

225
00:19:54,713 --> 00:20:10,542
[SPEAKER_03]: and now frontline workers and hardworking artists, programmers, PR types of folks are paying the price because somebody at the top thought they could make the next money printing game just by making it.

226
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's simply not true.

227
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:20,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say though, and I'm not going to repeat too much of what he said on his show, because I'll forge you over to Bobby Blackwolf's show, because he's on before us live.

228
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:32,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he had a really interesting take on this, and I thought he was really right on, so I do kind of want to repeat it, but he was talking a little bit about how in this day and age, you have these very, very, very large budget games.

229
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth just came out this week, right?

230
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how many millions of dollars that game take to make.

231
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:45,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And think about how many millions of dollars these other large AAA games take to make.

232
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:49,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And the industry can't substantiate all of these AAA games.

233
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:53,348
[SPEAKER_03]: The games that tend to succeed are the ones that are made with smaller teams.

234
00:20:53,348 --> 00:20:59,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go back in the day to the Atari 2600 days, it took one person to make a lot of those games.

235
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Howard Scott Warshaw programmed ET for better or worse by himself.

236
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:09,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Art, music, game design, all of it by himself.

237
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,012
[SPEAKER_03]: and David Crane, Pitfall, etc, etc.

238
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: The story goes on, you know, there were, to be fair to the folks in the 80s, there were, of course, people involved with PR, making the instruction manual, but I think you get my point.

239
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:26,443
[SPEAKER_03]: You made a big game with a lot less people back in those days.

240
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:30,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those games, when adjusting for inflation, those games were selling for like $90.

241
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:36,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe even more, honestly.

242
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:38,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby gave some of the exact figures on his show.

243
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I mean when we're talking about inflation, right?

244
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,765
[SPEAKER_03]: What used to cost $50 back in the day costs a lot more now.

245
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:48,496
[SPEAKER_06]: and now- I like what Bad Culture said too.

246
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in chat over at twitch.tv.

247
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:53,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to repeat it because it's a joke.

248
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Massive amounts of Coke.

249
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

250
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,501
[SPEAKER_02]: They consume so much Coca-Cola.

251
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:01,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, you know, made Coke what it is today.

252
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is true.

253
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:03,944
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

254
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:11,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to pick on this particular individual, but how do you think people met those six week deadlines on those games?

255
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:17,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Drinking all that delicious Coca-Cola beverage product.

256
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:18,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And cocaine.

257
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:19,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of cocaine.

258
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Just gonna throw that out there.

259
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:22,964
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

260
00:22:22,964 --> 00:22:25,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster always... They went on an 8-ball bender.

261
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster always points out, and this is correct too, to piggyback on what Rob is saying, back then selling 50 or 100K copies of a game for the PC was considered monumental.

262
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And so on and so on.

263
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, you guys get the point.

264
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:43,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I want to point at Bobby's show because I think he framed it very well and so forth.

265
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:48,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope you're listening to both of our shows because, you know, I want to support all our pals here at VOG Network.

266
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:52,968
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, what it boils down to is that

267
00:22:54,551 --> 00:23:07,158
[SPEAKER_03]: All these companies want to make these very expensive games because they see them printing money like Pokemon Go, but the reality is Pokemon Go is something that happens once in a blue moon, or a Fortnite, you name it.

268
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I keep coming back to Pokemon Go, but fine.

269
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortnite, you know, the games that have been successful with it.

270
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I was even dead by daylight on the Battle Pass front.

271
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that game...

272
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:22,185
[SPEAKER_03]: for what it is and the budget that that game was likely made on very well and very long running for that format.

273
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:30,308
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all know for every Dead by Daylight, there's been easily 20 other horror games flopping.

274
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:42,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like a lot of it, like if you are focusing, obviously you want to be profitable as a company, but if what you're looking at is I'm looking to make money instead of I'm looking to make a game,

275
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:47,555
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're going to get garbage is what you're going to get.

276
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:53,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, the video game industry and the movie industry often a lot more related than we'd like to think.

277
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:57,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not just talking literally about how like a lot of great TV shows right now are based on video games.

278
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where the movie industry tends to go, the video game industry tends to go.

279
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been, if there's been one of a few themes that have come up in the 22 years we've been doing this show,

280
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,129
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the big ones.

281
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the movie industry goes, the video games tend to follow.

282
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

283
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,452
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie industry is suffering a similar problem right now.

284
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:26,735
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dealing with it in very different ways, but there's also a lot of layoffs happening, I want to say, with all the write-offs.

285
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:29,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Warner Brothers actually lay off a bunch of people recently, too?

286
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:30,817
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those companies did.

287
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, somebody in chat will correct me, I'm sure.

288
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:33,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, internet.

289
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:36,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I wanted to talk about was all these streaming services.

290
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:45,146
[SPEAKER_03]: All these streaming services making these big budget productions, big budget productions.

291
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is the movie industry now learning?

292
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:52,729
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't want to subscribe to all of these fucking streaming services.

293
00:24:52,729 --> 00:25:04,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might not be profitable to make all of these big budget productions because people aren't going to go to a service necessarily just for one thing or they're going to watch it and then they're going to cancel it or so on.

294
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:06,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably a better idea

295
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:09,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Paramount Plus and Peacock

296
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:33,167
[SPEAKER_03]: if they actually were to combine.

297
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm all for Mt.

298
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:34,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Cock.

299
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:37,349
[SPEAKER_03]: A service with Drag Race and the traitors?

300
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:37,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

301
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, all joking aside about Mt.

302
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:40,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Cock.

303
00:25:42,426 --> 00:25:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like this is sadly through these layoffs where we see the game industry may actually be going.

304
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to tell just yet.

305
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:56,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not willing to give the credit to the CEO of the gaming industries that they're getting it right.

306
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:57,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not willing to give that credit yet.

307
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:59,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're years off from seeing that.

308
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the gaming industry is starting to realize

309
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:16,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be able to make smaller games that move a profitable amount of copies other than putting all of our money into games that will forever print money and then fucking shit the bed when they're released.

310
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:23,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's also kind of I think why we may see this move to more multi-platform stuff because you look at it like

311
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:35,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you want to get people in on your, you know, if you're Sony or Microsoft, you want them in on your, you know, ecosystem, but you're not profitable on consoles.

312
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:39,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't think you really care about selling consoles or not.

313
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could just get your products

314
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:46,715
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever people are playing games, then that's a win-win for you.

315
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:56,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, though, if you're looking to get more of the money, buying a certain platform, for example, that's where they have those exclusives.

316
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if those are necessarily paying as much dividends as they used to.

317
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:10,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may see a lot of these things go either exclusive for a short period of time or start really branching out multi-platform.

318
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:19,035
[SPEAKER_02]: PC, maybe even other consoles, you know, especially if we see Microsoft having success with that, with what they're doing.

319
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:25,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's already experimented with that a little bit with MLB, but I don't think this is the end of that for sure.

320
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:29,780
[SPEAKER_03]: reading some comments in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

321
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,144
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of comments about release Coyote versus Acme and Batgirl, damn it, says PodCulture.

322
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby said the first comment there.

323
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL talking about Netflix having crossover content recently.

324
00:27:40,568 --> 00:27:45,192
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of those streaming services are picking up international shows too, which is a big, big thing.

325
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:46,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But this comment made me laugh.

326
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:53,378
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTosuya in chat said, I would be okay that we have Paramount Plus through Walmart and wouldn't mind subbing to the cock.

327
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:56,028
[SPEAKER_03]: using apostrophe cock.

328
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:01,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Peacock, you are missing a brilliant marketing opportunity.

329
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have these ads with like all of these very overtly heterosexual men talking about, yeah, man, are you subbing to the cock?

330
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:15,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Matt's house tonight because he's got the cock and they could do, it could be this whole thing.

331
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:18,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're going over there to watch what?

332
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:24,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Football games that are streamed on Peacock, WWF, and all the very manly things that you can only find on the cock.

333
00:28:25,757 --> 00:28:28,782
[SPEAKER_02]: here's the problem is what is peacock doing?

334
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:40,200
[SPEAKER_02]: macho little man babies would flip their lid they're like oh my god they're trying to make me woke and gay i can't have this like it just you made me think about cocks oh no

335
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:42,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I am gay!

336
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:45,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, those liberals, dammit, they've done it again!

337
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:47,707
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, it's... that's the problem.

338
00:28:47,707 --> 00:28:49,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the society we live in.

339
00:28:49,649 --> 00:29:00,719
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was, like, the 1990s or something like that, sure, like, that type of joke would be perfectly fine on television, but, uh, unfortunately, people are too, like... I don't know.

340
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Uptight, I guess.

341
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

342
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,604
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I-I just... I can't help but think about...

343
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:10,704
[SPEAKER_03]: All these panels I've done over the years talking about podcasts at places like DragonCon and stuff.

344
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:23,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always, I always tell people when you're going to start a podcast, you need to think about not just the name of your podcast, but you need to think about what is going to make your podcast different from, and I swear there's a point here, what's going to make your podcast different from other podcasts.

345
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:26,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should always have that movie poster line.

346
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:27,562
[SPEAKER_03]: right?

347
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:33,626
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always that movie poster line under the name, you know, like Poltergeist, they're here is like the little thing, right?

348
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You always have that little line under it, right?

349
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:40,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much do I believe now the line that should be under Orange Lounge Radio is woke and gay?

350
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:52,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard

351
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,595
[SPEAKER_02]: to our channel tags.

352
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:55,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

353
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:58,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Woke and gay.

354
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:11,741
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what would you say, if you could, if you could summarize the secret to having a very successful 22 year long running podcast in just three words, what three words would you pick?

355
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Two words.

356
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:13,201
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

357
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:16,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Shrug emoji.

358
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:18,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I pitched you the perfect setup.

359
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:18,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Swing and a miss.

360
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:19,263
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

361
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Woke and gay.

362
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

363
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:23,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Woke and gay.

364
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:23,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

365
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:27,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

366
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, uh, looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

367
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:39,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw says Walmart buying Vizio means that you'll see a lot of Walmart advertisements on those TVs plastered everywhere.

368
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and there's gonna get video games.

369
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.

370
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:45,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they make some of the money back ads and gamings and all that stuff.

371
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, all of it.

372
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:47,374
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

373
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,498
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

374
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:55,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it sucks that these layoffs are happening.

375
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:56,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's not the end of it.

376
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it's not the end of it.

377
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:04,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as much as I've been talking about, oh, Nintendo's been to me, I think we'll probably hear something on that front.

378
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope not.

379
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:08,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to just accept the reality.

380
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:08,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably coming.

381
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:17,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine that these will die down after the end of March.

382
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:18,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal year.

383
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:19,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal year.

384
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:27,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're trying to pad the numbers a bit to make them look more profitable than they are by doing these layoffs.

385
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:35,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think once they've passed that mark and they've given the numbers to their investors that it should calm down a little bit for a few months.

386
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:38,059
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, eventually they'll have to deal with reality again.

387
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,983
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

388
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:07,794
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week was a little blue.

389
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:11,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little blue.

390
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:18,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get a little bit more into that, but basically...

391
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I, of course, I played Dead by Daylight.

392
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played some Genshin Impact.

393
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:38,103
[SPEAKER_06]: But I played something else that has significantly taken up my attention.

394
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:44,184
[SPEAKER_05]: What that thing is is Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora.

395
00:32:44,184 --> 00:32:44,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

396
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:46,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly,

397
00:32:48,772 --> 00:32:51,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I freaking love it.

398
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:57,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... It's really just... I don't really...

399
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:01,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a way to describe it.

400
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:12,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got all of the exploration and puzzling of, you know, like, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.

401
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:25,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has a lot more of the realism and kinda combat-y stuff for folks who like to play those combat-y games, you know?

402
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:25,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh...

403
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:35,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, you know, I like sort of, I've been trying to think of how I like, how I say it was sort of like the artificial sociology.

404
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

405
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:42,713
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like created cultures and things like that.

406
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:43,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say I,

407
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:47,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I really got into it.

408
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:49,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the kinds of things that I like in a game.

409
00:33:49,789 --> 00:34:02,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took all of my favorite things that I liked in the movies and just smashed them all into one thing and it's really, really freaking pretty.

410
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I can't get over it.

411
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've sat and played

412
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,232
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

413
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I just really don't know what to say.

414
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:27,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just been really nice.

415
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:28,849
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, really fun.

416
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:33,351
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, like even I still haven't haven't even seen the second Avatar movie.

417
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,833
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing I know about Avatar, it's pretty.

418
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you want to play a video game.

419
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:38,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

420
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's pretty.

421
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:46,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get there's probably more in-depth stuff, especially for somebody who I know you were a fan of the first movie and so forth, you know, and all of that.

422
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,223
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, yeah, there's a lot of there's probably a lot of lore and things to unpack.

423
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:55,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's but it's it's also pretty, you know, so I think there's there's a lot of that.

424
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:58,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster in chat says Avatar Frontiers is still on my list.

425
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I love open box sandboxes.

426
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:14,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I think especially with that particular IP, and the reason why a lot of people are drawn to Avatar, I think an open box sandbox in that universe is really what, you know, there's there's certain people that are really looking for that a lot of people.

427
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:21,553
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 says sometimes a shiny comes along and distracts you from your main quest.

428
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:31,589
[SPEAKER_06]: That happens a lot, but what I like about it is that you also don't really necessarily have, like, A-level systems, per se.

429
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:39,912
[SPEAKER_06]: You discover things that increase your health, you upgrade your armor, so a little bit more realistic as to how well you do.

430
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:45,593
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you find better craftsmen or better quality materials to craft with.

431
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:45,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

432
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:53,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like doing all of the, like, clan things.

433
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:03,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And, like, my brain is just, like, has been, like, super, like, I want more story for the character I'm playing, you know?

434
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give her a name, for example.

435
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:14,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to, you know, they just call her by her clan name, which, you know, she and these other kids that were kidnapped are the only people left.

436
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:24,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it could be she or he or they or whatever you want, but I've just, I've been just all over the place.

437
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:28,500
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a non-binary Navi in the game.

438
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was cool.

439
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:33,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And didn't treat it like it was anything special, you know.

440
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,502
[SPEAKER_06]: They just said, oh, they are here.

441
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:35,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you talk to them,

442
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,063
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't tell.

443
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,564
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.

444
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:45,607
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem really androgynous to me.

445
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:48,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that was handled well.

446
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, if you try to go to a place that maybe is at the boundary or something, they have a legitimate reason for it.

447
00:36:56,573 --> 00:37:01,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, this is too far for your ikran to travel to, or blah blah blah.

448
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:01,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

449
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:08,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just been... Just, I don't know.

450
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:10,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have so much fun with it.

451
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:21,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Down to the riding the Dire Horses, to, you know, the whole quest that took me for freaking ever to tame your Ikran, or not tame, but to bond with one.

452
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:33,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And also it gives a really good message to it, because, you know, when you go to take down these sites by, you know, the RDA, the humans that are trying to be shitholes, you know,

453
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:44,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The area around it is polluted and sapped of energy and you can't use any of the materials that you find there except for like sticks.

454
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you take it down, everything is reclaimed.

455
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:59,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that, you know, it really drives into about how people want more of things that they don't need instead of being happy with what they have.

456
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:04,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's, you know, that's pretty interesting too.

457
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:13,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, you know, certainly moral lessons trying to be taught in it that may not appeal to everybody, but I don't know.

458
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:14,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

459
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:15,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm cool with it.

460
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, I'm having a lot of fun.

461
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:18,545
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

462
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:19,206
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

463
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:20,386
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the word right there.

464
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games are supposed to be fun.

465
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's fun and how you're having fun,

466
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

467
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:30,615
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't gotta justify that to anybody.

468
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:34,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just also going over some of the high points of the game.

469
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:38,881
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that I like is that you do not have to beat the game right away.

470
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to beat any of the things.

471
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:45,046
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just run around and go hunting if you want to.

472
00:38:46,301 --> 00:39:01,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can bring back like the things that you gather and give it to different camps and and home like the home tree or the base camp for another group or and It's just really really I don't know.

473
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that's fun.

474
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:04,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of get to live in in

475
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,975
[SPEAKER_06]: in their, you know, bare feet for a little while.

476
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:18,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, I remember after that first movie came out, that's what some people really wanted to do, was live in that world, you know, and video games are a way to kind of do that a little bit, so.

477
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:24,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and one other thing that's important as well, that first game that came out is considered non-canon.

478
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:27,783
[SPEAKER_06]: This is considered canon.

479
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:33,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they bring in all kinds of stuff in the movies and it's set between the first and second movie.

480
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:38,010
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's move on.

481
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's it for your gaming week, we'll talk to Loki.

482
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:42,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And how was your gaming week?

483
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:45,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played Minecraft, as usual.

484
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:46,552
[SPEAKER_03]: That all?

485
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:46,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that.

486
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:47,532
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

487
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:56,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been working on just the big build for my first Dark Ride, which is taking a lot of time.

488
00:39:56,175 --> 00:40:01,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually editing together another episode now that's kind of in between all that stuff.

489
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And just been

490
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Messing around in the game.

491
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,018
[SPEAKER_02]: About it.

492
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:09,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't done anything exciting.

493
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:10,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

494
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:10,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

495
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:12,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV

496
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been playing a bit of Diablo 4.

497
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:47,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I've expressed on this show before I was not a fan of the current season compared to the other two, and I'm still not.

498
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:54,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've really tried to make some changes to make it a bit more palatable, make it less annoying with some of the platform mechanics.

499
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:59,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think just at its core, putting the platform mechanics in the game was really bad idea.

500
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, but I think

501
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:04,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the creators are getting the message loud and clear.

502
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:08,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not on our show roll tonight, but they're going to be doing a public test realm for the next season.

503
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's huge because I think it shows that they want to get feedback before they actually launch it.

504
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:14,635
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not trying to be so secretive.

505
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:17,476
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also making huge changes when it comes to things like itemization.

506
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that is all very welcome.

507
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:27,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want to finish the battle pass for this particular season because, yes, I did buy the battle pass, but I love Diablo.

508
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:35,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And even when I'm not super into the season as much as others, it's still very, like, I get in that zone.

509
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I think very similar to, you know, what you hear my co-hosts talk about the games that they enjoy.

510
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:48,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You get in that zone, and it's just like, just slaying the demons and, you know, clicking and seeing the numbers go up is a very just mind-numbingly wonderful thing.

511
00:41:50,512 --> 00:42:11,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I can talk about here instead, I want to take a little bit of a tangent train because I want to talk about the cruise because I know last week we weren't here and I was talking to Bobby Blackwolf on Discord and I told him in a couple sentences something that happened and he kind of left you with a teaser on last week's show and that was true.

512
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go ahead and tell you the story now exactly what all went into that.

513
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know my co host may be wondering what the hell are you talking about?

514
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:19,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cover it.

515
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:28,814
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to preface this by saying, the day that it happened, I thought that this would be like a funny story, I would be able to tell a lot.

516
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:30,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to tell a story.

517
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this story, I almost die.

518
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:36,760
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very, I'm, this is not, um,

519
00:42:38,314 --> 00:42:39,255
[SPEAKER_03]: hyperbole.

520
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:41,216
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a legit thing that happened.

521
00:42:41,216 --> 00:42:42,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to explain it here.

522
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:50,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that reason, I've been having trauma the past couple nights and difficulty trying to sleep.

523
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:53,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting better since the incident happened.

524
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were a few nights after that, that like I was like legit having nightmares and kind of reliving the experience and so forth.

525
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:09,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm telling this now because I'm fine with this being recorded and out there because I'm not sure how often I want to tell this story again.

526
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably will not be telling this story, even though there are some interesting celebrity twists to it.

527
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:21,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not be telling this story on at work, because if I do, I'm going to have to tell it in every meeting I go to.

528
00:43:21,452 --> 00:43:29,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be telling this with the Rocky Horror and Love Horror crowd or even certain groups of people that know me IRL, because I just I'm going to be sick of telling it at a certain point.

529
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:33,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am going to tell it now because I promised I would.

530
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:35,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what happened.

531
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:38,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell you about the Curaçao incident.

532
00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So the boat for this cruise that we were on was scheduled to stop in two places.

533
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:48,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to Curaçao and we were going to go to Aruba.

534
00:43:48,163 --> 00:43:54,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, when you go on a cruise ship, you try to plan what are you going to do for those few hours while you're in these different places.

535
00:43:56,327 --> 00:43:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Curacao was one of the places that we were going.

536
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:10,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And the official excursions, that's what they call it when you're going to go on a shopping adventure or you're going to go on a boat tour or something, the official excursions through the Royal Caribbean who did the cruise.

537
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:16,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I think everybody knows this at this point, but for any new listeners, I was on a Star Trek themed cruise.

538
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:18,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important, right?

539
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:20,566
[SPEAKER_03]: All these actors, it's like a floating convention type of thing.

540
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:26,370
[SPEAKER_03]: All the excursions for Curacao were sold out long in advance.

541
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes what people will do is they'll put together like a private excursion.

542
00:44:29,272 --> 00:44:34,296
[SPEAKER_03]: They go out and they find these other types of things that can happen.

543
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:39,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a trusted friend was putting together this excursion to go on a powerboat trip

544
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Out around the island of Curaçao.

545
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:46,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was going to be about 18 of us.

546
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:59,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of this trip, we were going to get to have an opportunity to do some snorkeling in what they call the Blue Cave, which is a very, like one of those, and you see these things in books, like it's this underwater cave with blue tinge and a blue hue.

547
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:06,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just the fish you can see when you're snorkeling, like a turtle at the bottom of the ocean and all this stuff with the Blue Cave and everything.

548
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:10,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I saw the pictures, I was like, Oh, hell yes, I want to do this.

549
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be with friends.

550
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:16,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it won't just exclusively be friends, because I think the boat held 18 people.

551
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:17,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So the friend was really trying to fill it out.

552
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:23,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, maybe not everybody I would know, but I would know most of the people and everybody's a Star Trek nerd anyway.

553
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:29,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're all gonna, you know, kind of be in a similar kind of mindset nerds going out on an adventure.

554
00:45:30,117 --> 00:45:31,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get to Curacao.

555
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:33,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We're walking to find the boat.

556
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a hard time finding it because of its construction, but thanks to maps, we find it.

557
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:38,420
[SPEAKER_03]: We get there.

558
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, before we're actually walking over there, we're getting in the waiting area.

559
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:50,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that one of the people that's waiting with us is, this is more just an interesting kind of part of the story.

560
00:45:50,283 --> 00:45:52,284
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the people waiting is Garrett Wong.

561
00:45:52,284 --> 00:45:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know that name, he played a character on Star Trek Voyager, Harry Kim.

562
00:45:56,525 --> 00:46:00,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you ever saw Star Trek Voyager, you might remember Harry Kim.

563
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:04,972
[SPEAKER_03]: The joke is that he was never promoted throughout the entirety of the show and so forth.

564
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,573
[SPEAKER_03]: He even does a stand up bit on that.

565
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:09,275
[SPEAKER_03]: That was an actor that played that role named Garrett Wong.

566
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:12,297
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually still he he's very heavy in Star Trek fandom.

567
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:14,899
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes to Dragon Con and all this stuff.

568
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:20,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was waiting in the area come to find out he was a friend of a friend and was actually coming on this excursion with us.

569
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:23,406
[SPEAKER_03]: which is just kind of like, I don't, I don't usually guess.

570
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:23,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

571
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:24,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

572
00:46:24,026 --> 00:46:29,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't get starstruck or any of that stuff really, you know, once in a blue moon, I did meet LeVar Burton on this cruise.

573
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:31,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was like the one day I was starstruck.

574
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:39,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like LeVar Burton in many ways, like, like literally after school was teaching, he was an educator.

575
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:39,892
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a teacher.

576
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:41,452
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of my favorite teachers, right.

577
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:42,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Through reading rainbow.

578
00:46:42,193 --> 00:46:45,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people of a certain age, you know, associate that with LeVar Burton, but anyway, so

579
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:48,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get starstruck with him.

580
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:53,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, like people like Garrett, I'm like, whatever, he goes to Dragon Con like me, and he participates with tracks.

581
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:58,519
[SPEAKER_03]: He just has this very unique job that he did in his 20s, and continues to dabble in and so forth.

582
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:03,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a boat, friends, Garrett, going out in the ocean.

583
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Curacao, beautiful water.

584
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:09,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, like just blue water that you would only see in fucking books and stuff.

585
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:10,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was amazing stuff.

586
00:47:10,604 --> 00:47:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We go.

587
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on a boat and it's rocking up and down because it's like it's like being on a roller coaster, right?

588
00:47:16,784 --> 00:47:24,531
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to after probably a good 20 minutes, and I'm watching us on the map, we're going like halfway around the island, we get to where the blue cave is.

589
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:30,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very exciting, because this is why I wanted to see from all the picture books and all this stuff.

590
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:32,158
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a problem.

591
00:47:32,158 --> 00:47:37,723
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, the boat is only able to go inside the blue cave when it's low tide.

592
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:41,807
[SPEAKER_03]: when it's high tide, the boat can't go in the cave.

593
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:57,801
[SPEAKER_03]: However, what the excursion folks do is that they park the boat, where it is safe to do so where the water is, you know, deep enough to put the anchor down and you know, whatever it's trade, they can't do it right next to the cave, they have to do it a significant distance from the cave.

594
00:47:57,801 --> 00:47:58,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And they park there.

595
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:02,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you do is that you you get out into the ocean and you snorkel

596
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:08,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I accidentally hit the mute button while I was talking to my hands.

597
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:12,041
[SPEAKER_03]: You get out of the boat and you snorkel your way over to the cave.

598
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:18,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then you have to like hold your head as you go under the rock so you can actually get into the cave because the water is that high, right?

599
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:27,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually suggest you can go out with a life preserver on but if you do it, it's going to be almost impossible for you to actually get under the rock and get inside the blue cave.

600
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:34,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So a few of my friends take off and they start, you know, doing their snorkel thing and they're going over there and so forth.

601
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:44,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm kind of thinking, well, my snorkeling experience isn't very vast, but I'm probably in better physical shape than I've been in my entire life ever since I lost the weight for diabetes.

602
00:48:44,516 --> 00:48:49,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, you know, I've been swimming enough where I trust my abilities to do so and so forth.

603
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:50,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friends kind of go.

604
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:52,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But because we were having a conversation,

605
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:17,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the other people were already pretty much on their way towards the blue cave and almost over there.

606
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:29,638
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a contingent of people left in the boat looking for life preservers because they they wanted to go but they didn't they were like we don't care we want to get close enough but we don't need to go in like we'll wear the life jackets.

607
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:33,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So I finally decide to get in the water and I start going.

608
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go and I'm swimming and I'm a decent swimmer.

609
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:40,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I get about halfway to where the cave is.

610
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:47,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And my problem is, is that I'm using really cheap rental snorkel gear that I'm not super comfortable with using and doing.

611
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And I start to have a pretty bad mishap.

612
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Water starts getting in my tube, the snorkeling tube.

613
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:54,894
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

614
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:10,929
[SPEAKER_03]: continue.

615
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:15,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And I notice I am halfway exactly between the boat and the blue cave.

616
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:19,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say, you know what, I'm going to head back to the boat.

617
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:24,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the boat, I know what's there, the blue cave, I don't know what's there.

618
00:50:24,015 --> 00:50:29,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if my friends are over there able to stand on things they weren't, or what they could do, I need to go back to the boat.

619
00:50:29,897 --> 00:50:31,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So I start to go back to the boat.

620
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:40,779
[SPEAKER_03]: but my problems start to compound and I start to panic more and my legs start burning and they're hurting and I realize I'm in trouble.

621
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:44,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm starting to get overwhelmed.

622
00:50:44,354 --> 00:50:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the moment where I noticed the excursion director, she saw what was happening.

623
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:55,541
[SPEAKER_03]: She started immediately swimming towards me, she knew what was happening.

624
00:50:55,541 --> 00:51:09,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to float on my back a little bit, because that I do know how to do to try to stay but because of the rough waters, it being high tide, I was having a real problem doing that without water going where it shouldn't be and panicking almost a little bit more.

625
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it happens, I start screaming, help, help, help.

626
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:15,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear from the boat, are you serious?

627
00:51:15,936 --> 00:51:17,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because there were still people in the boat.

628
00:51:17,518 --> 00:51:19,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, just about four or five people in the boat.

629
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:23,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, and I'm frantically kicking around and so forth.

630
00:51:23,184 --> 00:51:26,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the people still in the boat, by the way, is Garrett Wong.

631
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:29,832
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of the people that was looking for life preserver and another friend.

632
00:51:29,832 --> 00:51:31,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in my mind,

633
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:34,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I get tossed a life jacket.

634
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that happened.

635
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,461
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't in my mind.

636
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:39,563
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, I saw the life jacket being thrown by Garrett Wong.

637
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:46,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But later that night at dinner, I found out it was a different friend of a friend, Greg, who actually threw the life jacket, but Garrett was standing next to him.

638
00:51:46,506 --> 00:51:51,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And throws me the life jacket, and I'm able to grab onto it, so I have something to kind of like float in the water with.

639
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:58,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, the lady kind of makes her way to me and is able to kind of push me there.

640
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:06,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to the ladder, and I get pulled up by Greg and Garrett, basically pull me up over the boat thing, and I make it.

641
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:07,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm back on the boat, and I'm A-OK.

642
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:14,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, as you can imagine, I'm, my heart rate is through the roof.

643
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result, I'm getting nauseous from everything that's going on.

644
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:21,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I'm dying of embarrassment is really what it is.

645
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dying of embarrassment.

646
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:35,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's not even the fact that it's like a, a certain type of celebrity, but like all my friends and I like thought I could do this thing, but the situation compounded and just got completely out of control.

647
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:36,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just like,

648
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:39,087
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was just all those things.

649
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:41,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, freaking out, right.

650
00:52:41,387 --> 00:52:44,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, I calmed down.

651
00:52:44,648 --> 00:52:56,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, those that wanted to keep going, they did, they got back out to the cave, including Garrett and everybody, they got their life jackets on, they went to the cave, did their thing, and came back, Alan was still on the boat, able to help me, which was fine.

652
00:52:56,292 --> 00:53:05,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And once the boat starts to take off, and we go to our second and third destinations, which I didn't try to do this again, they asked me, do I want to put on a life jacket and try I said, you know what, fool me once,

653
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:09,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But fool me twice, I'm a dumb bitch, so I'm not gonna do this again.

654
00:53:09,537 --> 00:53:13,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stayed in the boat and actually once the boat got moving again, my nausea kind of cleared up.

655
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:15,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really weird thing.

656
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly enough, I wasn't the only one who got nauseous.

657
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:25,745
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my other friends who did the swim the whole way out and back, his heart rate got so high as a result, he actually

658
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:27,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Over the Boat

659
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:53,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody assured me it was fine.

660
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:53,920
[SPEAKER_03]: These things happen.

661
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,980
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just concerned about my well-being and so forth.

662
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was certainly dying of experience.

663
00:53:57,641 --> 00:54:01,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was definitely a scary experience.

664
00:54:01,362 --> 00:54:05,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, should I have probably known better?

665
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:06,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

666
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:10,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm watching all of my friends in various states of athletic

667
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:17,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Sizzum, you know, doing this and I was like, Oh, I won't have a problem doing this.

668
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:17,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did.

669
00:54:17,673 --> 00:54:19,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was it was really the snorkel spot.

670
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:22,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have been more prepared for what the snorkeling would actually entail.

671
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:23,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't.

672
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:27,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, if it was going to be like that, I should have just swam normally or something.

673
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:28,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

674
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:37,157
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, like I said, I, I've been replaying that incident a couple times since then.

675
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:43,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though the day it happened, it was one of those like, oh, this is funny, because it was and we were joking about like, I even talked with Garrett about it afterwards.

676
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:47,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were because we were talking about Dragon Con and some other stuff that we have in common.

677
00:54:47,424 --> 00:54:50,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was joking about, you know, Garrett, I'm gonna have to tell this story.

678
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:51,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to embellish it.

679
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to talk about how you saved my life with mouth to mouth resuscitation.

680
00:54:54,688 --> 00:55:22,551
[SPEAKER_03]: and all this stuff right you know and so forth i'm joking he's like oh yeah that's funny you should do it you should tell this story so forth but like in the days that have followed it i'm like i i i actually don't like talking about this so but there you go i promised the story there um there it is and it is i will say this it's interesting like if i'm gonna embarrass myself do it fucking bigly

681
00:55:24,258 --> 00:55:26,119
[SPEAKER_03]: on a big scale, right?

682
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:31,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is has nothing to do with video games, but I know some of you are curious, the rest of the cruise was fine.

683
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like I don't want to make it sound like it ruined everything.

684
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:44,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was just definitely one of those like humbling moments of like, oh, I'll have to take some notes and remember some things for next time.

685
00:55:44,872 --> 00:55:48,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And read the fine print on what an adventure might actually entail and all that stuff.

686
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:50,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway,

687
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:53,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

688
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:53,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

689
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby says, I didn't hear the whole thing.

690
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have teased it otherwise.

691
00:55:56,441 --> 00:55:57,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Not your fault.

692
00:55:57,102 --> 00:56:01,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you to tease it because literally when I was texting you, I was still on the boat, Bobby.

693
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:03,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that had just happened.

694
00:56:03,788 --> 00:56:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 30 minutes.

695
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:14,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I knew you were live or were about to be I don't remember what the time change and everything because yeah, but I knew it was like coming up and so forth.

696
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:14,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So

697
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:24,741
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL in chat says, did you sue the snorkeling rental company?

698
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:26,203
[SPEAKER_03]: No, why would I?

699
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:28,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody forced me to do that.

700
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:33,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I can sit here and say, well, the snorkel rent stuff was cheap.

701
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But

702
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:38,543
[SPEAKER_03]: She did do what she needed to do to make sure I wasn't going to drown.

703
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:39,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget that part of the story.

704
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:42,886
[SPEAKER_03]: She instantly saw what was happening and intervened in the situation.

705
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:47,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm no, I don't like I don't blame the company.

706
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:48,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that.

707
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized having that recorded means I could never take any and that's I don't I don't want to.

708
00:56:53,352 --> 00:56:55,394
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, I

709
00:56:56,877 --> 00:56:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: made a bad decision.

710
00:56:58,538 --> 00:56:59,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens.

711
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:03,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, SEO 100 Matt says, glad you're safe.

712
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:04,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry that happened to you.

713
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry about the trauma it's caused after.

714
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:06,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

715
00:57:06,304 --> 00:57:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've actually, because I did tell the story to some friends the other night, I actually found out a friend of mine had a almost exact same thing experience minus the Star Trek connection on a different cruise.

716
00:57:18,032 --> 00:57:21,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and he says, that's why I'll never go snorkeling again.

717
00:57:21,054 --> 00:57:22,355
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the, that was the most ridiculous.

718
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So anybody that's interested in snorkeling,

719
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:34,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a lot of practice before you do something like that, or know what the alternatives are, or what have you.

720
00:57:34,461 --> 00:57:37,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just, yeah, do it.

721
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what my secret is?

722
00:57:38,683 --> 00:57:40,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested in snorkeling.

723
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:48,082
[SPEAKER_03]: and Lesson Learned because I'm of two mindsets because there's definitely that one half of Rob.

724
00:57:48,082 --> 00:57:51,263
[SPEAKER_03]: After that happened, I was like, I'm going back home.

725
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:52,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking swimming lessons.

726
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:55,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to swim once a week at the gym.

727
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:56,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to build up that strength I need.

728
00:57:56,825 --> 00:57:58,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to do this again next year.

729
00:57:58,366 --> 00:58:00,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to fucking kick this thing's ass.

730
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:05,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely there's there's a half of me that was very much like the competitive Rob's like, No, I'm doing this again.

731
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:06,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to do it right.

732
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:08,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I've more landed on the other half.

733
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:08,909
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like,

734
00:58:10,114 --> 00:58:11,494
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

735
00:58:11,494 --> 00:58:16,756
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point in my life, I ate mayonnaise and I said, this is fucking disgusting.

736
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:19,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I never want it again.

737
00:58:19,356 --> 00:58:24,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I am at one point in my life, I did a snorkeling excursion and I decided, you know what?

738
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:31,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time I'm going to stick with the fucking shopping excursion because I know that that's for me and that's something that I'm going to do.

739
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:33,180
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

740
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:33,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried.

741
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:40,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I probably would have been more pissed off if I had gone all the way out there and then decided not to try at all.

742
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:49,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds really weird to say, considering what happened, but I can't help but feel like I would have, like, regretted, like, not trying.

743
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

744
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

745
00:58:53,314 --> 00:58:53,974
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

746
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:55,595
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the story.

747
00:58:55,595 --> 00:58:56,995
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk about video games again.

748
00:58:57,793 --> 00:58:58,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you made it back.

749
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you know, I do appreciate it.

750
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:06,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you know me in real life, you know, because I do have several real life friends, please understand.

751
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not in a rush to tell that story again.

752
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:10,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't ask.

753
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my nice way of saying don't ask.

754
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:13,221
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

755
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:19,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this as someone who lives with permanent PTSD.

756
00:59:19,424 --> 00:59:20,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not

757
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:33,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to talk about it or finding that you lose words or not being able to push it out is very, very normal.

758
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:36,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I do hope people respect your wishes.

759
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I am super thankful that

760
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:39,774
[SPEAKER_03]: and

761
01:00:05,273 --> 01:00:14,578
[SPEAKER_03]: give Garrett full permission and even my friend told him that he had full permission to use it in a bit if he wanted to because he tells he tells stories about the cruise and stuff like that.

762
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So I if for what I don't think he will I again because I'm sitting here going I don't know how that's funny.

763
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:22,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you make it funny.

764
01:00:22,682 --> 01:00:24,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there might be ways to do it.

765
01:00:24,403 --> 01:00:29,666
[SPEAKER_03]: But if for whatever reason he ever tells that story someday, he does have permission.

766
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, despite what I just said, I did give the permission.

767
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:33,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

768
01:00:33,348 --> 01:00:33,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

769
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:37,256
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not sure how a story like that's going to be funny.

770
01:00:37,256 --> 01:00:42,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I had heard something about as my friend and him were talking about it, there was a joke about mouth to mouth didn't work.

771
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:44,524
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried mouth to south and that got him right up.

772
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:49,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at this point, it turns into things that are completely fucking fiction that are just like so whatever.

773
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:53,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it says if it isn't what actually happened, then whatever.

774
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:53,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So

775
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,759
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, enough talk about that.

776
01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:01,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to video games because video games are how we escape these things.

777
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was it was overall it was good.

778
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:05,328
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

779
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,009
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough.

780
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:07,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about video games.

781
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:15,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki going back to studio talks and not layoffs, but merging and unmerging, right?

782
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:17,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely.

783
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:27,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we just had layoffs from the Embracer group, but now we're hearing of different studios trying to separate themselves from Embracer.

784
01:01:27,007 --> 01:01:37,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, one of those is Gearbox Entertainment, who is looking to separate from the company.

785
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:40,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Gearbox was acquired by Embracer for $1.3 billion back in 2021.

786
01:01:43,939 --> 01:01:53,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And according to Randy Pitchford, I'm delighted that what we might be up to is interesting enough for people to make a story about it for your readers.

787
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:57,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honored and humbled that our company is the topic of rumors, speculation, discussion.

788
01:01:57,486 --> 01:02:02,869
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I'll be thrilled to share whenever I have projects to announce or share something else.

789
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:05,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, he's not going to really say anything about it.

790
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:10,613
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rumors coming from that there were

791
01:02:12,304 --> 01:02:18,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, folks saying that they're looking to separate, maybe even go independent.

792
01:02:18,145 --> 01:02:21,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if that's still going to happen.

793
01:02:21,606 --> 01:02:28,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope so, because if not, you know, a lot of the companies under Embracer have kind of gone under.

794
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:34,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, speaking of Borderlands, the movie trailer was a movie trailer.

795
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:34,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go see it.

796
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:35,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that.

797
01:02:35,149 --> 01:02:35,969
[SPEAKER_03]: That came out.

798
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:37,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I never did go and watch that.

799
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed to do that.

800
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:38,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

801
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the casting of the characters is great.

802
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see them as those characters.

803
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:55,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The characters look okay, but I don't know.

804
01:02:55,612 --> 01:03:05,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see Kevin Hart as Roland, and I don't see... Oh god, I don't remember who's playing Lilith, but Kate Blanchett playing Lilith.

805
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:05,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

806
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:12,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Age and body types are just, it doesn't really fit to me.

807
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And also how they portray it.

808
01:03:13,514 --> 01:03:17,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind Jack Black doing the voice of Claptrap.

809
01:03:17,537 --> 01:03:18,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's okay.

810
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:23,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they had the original guy, but I understand that they broke those, burned that bridge.

811
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:24,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes sense too.

812
01:03:26,738 --> 01:03:27,558
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

813
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:31,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Saber Inactive is looking to leave Embracer Group as well.

814
01:03:31,919 --> 01:03:45,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So Saber Inactive just recently did the remake of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, and apparently that they're looking to, I guess they're worth $500 million.

815
01:03:45,243 --> 01:03:51,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Saber, they're saying this, of course, it was purchased by them back then for $525 million.

816
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:53,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be taking maybe a little bit of loss.

817
01:03:55,373 --> 01:04:03,217
[SPEAKER_02]: but apparently that there's an option for Saber to bring along multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well.

818
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may be purchasing themselves and maybe somebody else along with that.

819
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I will admit this whole separating from the bit that I didn't even know this was a thing that could be done and it's got to be a very complicated legal thing that I'm not going to pretend to understand.

820
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:23,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I just find this very interesting, especially with all the

821
01:04:24,918 --> 01:04:28,919
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, problems that Embracer has been having in their botched investment.

822
01:04:28,919 --> 01:04:29,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they need money.

823
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:38,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, if people are willing to buy some of their assets for, you know, I guess you break it down and make it that simple.

824
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess I guess that's what it is.

825
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:42,722
[SPEAKER_03]: If Embracer needs to make money, they'll sell, they'll sell them.

826
01:04:42,722 --> 01:04:43,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's yeah.

827
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's weird to hear that happening in a way.

828
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:47,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

829
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:51,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be interesting to see what what they end up doing.

830
01:04:53,513 --> 01:04:56,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope it's not more layoffs.

831
01:04:56,434 --> 01:05:03,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with that, though, we also have that Toys for Bob is going to be departing from Activision as well.

832
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be going independent.

833
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:11,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, they were the studio behind some of the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro games.

834
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:16,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at one time they may have even worked on Guitar Hero or Call of Duty.

835
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:17,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Skylanders

836
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:43,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm right.

837
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:49,853
[SPEAKER_03]: This seems to be a way for studios to lean the headcount without actually losing jobs.

838
01:05:49,853 --> 01:05:55,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So as as weird as this is, this actually seems like best case scenario for some of these things.

839
01:05:55,522 --> 01:05:55,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

840
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:58,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I wrong in that line of thinking?

841
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:04,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it allows, you know, Saber, Toys for, well, Toys for Bob just had layoffs, but I guess to avoid more or whatever.

842
01:06:04,873 --> 01:06:11,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like separating their own thing that can be run differently and not, you know, be subjected to the same.

843
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

844
01:06:11,817 --> 01:06:26,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they're not saying, you know, if they're keeping the IP, like, for example, Activision's keeping the IP and they're looking to cut, you know, bodies, they may be just like, listen, we'll just all leave and we'll be independent.

845
01:06:27,952 --> 01:06:30,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll take care of your body count that you need to cut or whatever.

846
01:06:30,913 --> 01:06:31,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

847
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:32,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know business.

848
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:34,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I'm talking about.

849
01:06:34,635 --> 01:06:40,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't have spent $2 billion or two, was it $2 trillion on all these different studios?

850
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:40,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

851
01:06:40,978 --> 01:06:45,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and if I did, I certainly would make crappy Saints Row game like they did Jesus.

852
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:46,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah.

853
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:54,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's talk about a big studio with a new game that people are very much looking forward to, I think.

854
01:06:54,916 --> 01:07:08,461
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, first, I just want to mention this, because in light of the story I just told, and something I'm, I'm noticing, I hadn't noticed till now, because I couldn't see this until under the studio lights, the lights I have here are a different type of hue.

855
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:15,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed it when I was holding my hand up to the camera, but this this yellow in there, it's a bruise.

856
01:07:16,004 --> 01:07:19,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I slammed against the boat and was flinging over the edge.

857
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:32,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry, I know that's a little weird, but I literally just now am seeing this for the first time because I knew it was bruised because I could feel it, but I couldn't see it until it was under this specific type of light until just now.

858
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:34,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So interesting.

859
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:35,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

860
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:44,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Pokemon because Pokemon is a great thing that we have fun with and it takes our mind off of all the troubles in the real world.

861
01:07:44,184 --> 01:07:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love Pokemon Legends.

862
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:50,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a great entry in the Pokemon franchise.

863
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:53,990
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm gonna be honest, I like Pokemon Legends more than I like mainstream Pokemon at this point.

864
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I'm not the only one that thinks that.

865
01:07:55,931 --> 01:08:11,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very excited to hear as a part of the recent Pokemon Direct that they did, or the Pokemon Presents, that Pokemon Legends ZA, or Z to A is what it really is, Pokemon Legends Z to A is a new game announced for 2025.

866
01:08:11,364 --> 01:08:19,491
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't say a lot, don't expect a frame of footage with it, but we just know that it's coming, it's coming in 2025.

867
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:30,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It is taking place in the Kalos region, that is from Pokemon X and Y, which were on, I believe that is Gen 6?

868
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it wasn't Sun and Moon, that came after the fact.

869
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:35,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's Gen 6, the first 3DS series?

870
01:08:35,623 --> 01:08:37,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a futuristic version of that.

871
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:47,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the city that is seen in the trailer that looks very Tron, Lumiose City, that is the only region for this game.

872
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:55,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm just going to assume I mean, because it would be silly to have a game with like just one region.

873
01:08:55,693 --> 01:08:58,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the futuristic element of it.

874
01:08:58,414 --> 01:09:04,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it's so big, it's probably split up into all these different varying types, like your ice region, your water region.

875
01:09:04,935 --> 01:09:09,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there will be at least five zones, just like there was in the first Pokemon Legends game.

876
01:09:09,956 --> 01:09:14,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people are like, oh, Pokemon Legends Zeta is only in Lumiose City.

877
01:09:14,557 --> 01:09:15,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of

878
01:09:16,517 --> 01:09:17,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Asterisks

879
01:09:33,223 --> 01:09:37,389
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know that for sure it's just the Switch.

880
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:40,412
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of talk about the Switch successor.

881
01:09:40,412 --> 01:09:48,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to be quite honest, I know there's been a lot of news about the Switch successor delayed to 2025, because that was in the news right before I left on the trip.

882
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:55,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope this game is coming out on the Switch successor as well.

883
01:09:55,470 --> 01:10:00,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Because from a technical perspective, Pokemon Legends barely made it.

884
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:05,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And it even has some technical problems, you know, that prevent it from being, you know, way up here.

885
01:10:05,253 --> 01:10:15,135
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason why people call POW World Pokemon, when it literally has nothing to do with Pokemon except the fact that some of the art looks really similar.

886
01:10:16,564 --> 01:10:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

887
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:39,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done with Pokemon games.

888
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:43,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I've barely played the last ones I bought.

889
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lost all interest.

890
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:46,002
[SPEAKER_06]: They're cute.

891
01:10:49,423 --> 01:10:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: S2100 Matt says, coming to Switch systems is how they phrased it.

892
01:10:56,905 --> 01:10:59,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Tsuya says, weren't there also issues with Scarlet and Violet?

893
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:00,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

894
01:11:00,927 --> 01:11:01,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

895
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:06,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm still convinced there was a Switch successor in planning that never happened.

896
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, go back and listen to an old episode.

897
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to hear me rant about that?

898
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon TCG Trading Card Game is digital with Pokemon TCG Pocket

899
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon TCG Pocket will have new elements

900
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:51,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I could give a shit about the trading card games.

901
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to be honest.

902
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:54,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a thing.

903
01:11:54,882 --> 01:11:57,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a thing not for me, and that's OK.

904
01:11:57,785 --> 01:12:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you are playing Scarlet and Violet, there are new seven star terror raid battles, including Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise with the Mightiest Mark.

905
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:12,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So if those are Pokemon you want to add to your team, those started over last week on the 28th.

906
01:12:14,021 --> 01:12:19,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Pokemon Horizons, the series, will be collaborating with Pokemon Go.

907
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,666
[SPEAKER_03]: That already, or no, it's starting on March 5th.

908
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I've seen so many Pikachus in so many different hats.

909
01:12:24,728 --> 01:12:30,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that we already saw that one, but no, the cap hat will be coming on March 5th.

910
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:34,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, a new attack for Pokemon Go, Volt Tackle, will be this as well.

911
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and some new Pokemon making their debut in Pokemon Go with this event.

912
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:40,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, Pokemon Master Sex,

913
01:12:41,892 --> 01:12:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, it's Pokemon Masters EX, but you run it together, it's Pokemon Masters SEX.

914
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:51,079
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have some new syncing pairs with it as well.

915
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:56,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play Masters SEX, Pokemon, so not something I really pay attention to.

916
01:12:56,042 --> 01:13:05,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Unite, I played this for a hot minute, and they have a Miradon's Unite license available and some more Cyril Edge, Phalanx also joining the roster, coming soon.

917
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:20,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Sleep will be getting a Legendary Pokemon, Raikou will be coming in March 2024, Entei and Sassoon will be coming after that, there's also a login bonus if you are still interested in the Pokemon Company knowing where you sleep at night.

918
01:13:20,303 --> 01:13:24,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, Pokemon Cafe Remix, you can do Gimme Ghoul Coins and that.

919
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:30,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, everything except the Legends announcement was very, okay, whatever, cool.

920
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:30,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

921
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:32,294
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

922
01:13:47,461 --> 01:14:08,314
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people like to get themselves in trouble, and I don't know why they didn't think this wouldn't be trouble, or why this seems to be the only group that Nintendo is focusing on, but Nintendo has filed a civil lawsuit that happened on February 26th against a developer called Tropic Haze that has a software called Yuzu.

923
01:14:10,356 --> 01:14:14,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yuzu is a Switch emulator.

924
01:14:14,839 --> 01:14:16,340
[SPEAKER_06]: PC and Linux right now.

925
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:21,324
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have on their site, they were working on a Mac one.

926
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:35,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But they let people with that technology pirate Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom for over 1 million times in a week and a half before the game came out.

927
01:14:38,855 --> 01:14:46,722
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically said that the harm was, and I'm going to use the quote here, manifest and irreparable, end quote.

928
01:14:46,722 --> 01:15:06,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was filed with the District Court of Rhode Island, and it says that their Yuzu software unlawfully circumvents the measures they have by executing code necessary to bypass

929
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:11,802
[SPEAKER_06]: technology associated with the Switch and its games.

930
01:15:11,802 --> 01:15:32,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, it's using a quote, illegally obtained copy of production keys that are secured on console, and then it uses those keys to pass around so that people can basically download and play the company's games outside of the Switch.

931
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:42,816
[SPEAKER_06]: In effect, Yuzu turns general computing devices into tools for massive intellectual property infringement of Nintendo and others' copyrighted works.

932
01:15:54,944 --> 01:16:09,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, Yuzu provides any internet user in the world with the means to unlawfully decrypt and play virtually any Nintendo Switch game, including Nintendo's current generation and most popular games, without ever paying a dime for a Nintendo console or that game.

933
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:17,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be clear, there is no lawful way to use Yuzu to play Nintendo Switch games, including because it must decrypt the game's encryption.

934
01:16:17,894 --> 01:16:26,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Defendant must be held accountable for willfully providing users the means to violate Nintendo's intellectual property rights at such a scale.

935
01:16:26,638 --> 01:16:29,499
[SPEAKER_06]: The harm to Nintendo is manifest and irreparable.

936
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:38,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, that emulator is out on Android, but whatever.

937
01:16:38,212 --> 01:16:59,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they are looking for $150,000 in damages and any additional damages and profits Yuzu made from its violations, including their alleged $30,000 a month that Tropic Haze makes from Patreon, and that they stand trial for it.

938
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:01,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

939
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:06,189
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

940
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:31,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I thought that, you know, well, I mean, it's precedent already that this stuff is legal, but I don't know.

941
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:44,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff that Nintendo is, you know, claiming here, but I, honestly, when they talk about a million pirated copies, when you consider the worldwide scale and the, I, I could see it.

942
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:48,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I really could, but yeah, but, but like pirated,

943
01:17:49,646 --> 01:17:56,350
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people that would work on emulators and pour a lot of their time into it, it's not about pirating software.

944
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:57,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Do people use emulators for that?

945
01:17:57,931 --> 01:17:58,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

946
01:17:58,672 --> 01:18:11,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But what emulators are for and should be for is preserving software, of which we all know Nintendo is one of the notorious worst companies doing it in many other things.

947
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:14,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize you all are going to point at the Switch Online and stuff, but no, no, no.

948
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,082
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many, many games that don't exist there and so forth.

949
01:18:18,337 --> 01:18:24,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the key circumventing part is going to be the tricky issue that they're going to get in hot water for.

950
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:45,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that they're really circumventing any of the keys.

951
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:49,599
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have the keys, you know, it's just like a ton of different emulators out there.

952
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:56,661
[SPEAKER_02]: What Nintendo's trying to do is trying to, what I think they're trying to do is they're not trying to win this case, they're just trying to bleed them of money.

953
01:18:56,661 --> 01:19:08,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So because getting them into, you know, a lawsuit is going to cost them a lot more money that they don't have versus what Nintendo can pony up and it'll just bleed the company completely bankrupt.

954
01:19:09,406 --> 01:19:10,667
[SPEAKER_02]: is what they're trying to do.

955
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:11,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think they have a case.

956
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:15,829
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, first off, let's assume that the 1 million number is correct.

957
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:20,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't prove that all those people downloaded that game to play it on Yuzu.

958
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:21,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't prove that.

959
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:23,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, literally cannot.

960
01:19:23,032 --> 01:19:32,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So to prove the causation that, well, because this emulator existed, all these copies got pirated, that's not necessarily true.

961
01:19:32,736 --> 01:19:35,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's a lot of things played on actual hardware.

962
01:19:36,881 --> 01:19:40,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, piracy issue is different from the emulator issue.

963
01:19:40,104 --> 01:19:46,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And I absolutely believe we need emulators because that's the only way this industry is going to have game preservation.

964
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:50,373
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, we need it.

965
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:56,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand where Nintendo is frustrated when their metrics and whatever they're looking at is showing them that they've lost, you know, a million.

966
01:19:56,398 --> 01:20:02,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But these I we have these were a million people that were never going to buy the game in the first place.

967
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,325
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that pirate things because they can.

968
01:20:06,653 --> 01:20:09,255
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people that pirate things because they can.

969
01:20:09,255 --> 01:20:10,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is a separate issue from the emulator.

970
01:20:10,996 --> 01:20:16,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, the way Nintendo sees it, if they shut down the emulator, aha, then those people have nothing to play this on.

971
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:18,500
[SPEAKER_03]: They use emulators on their console.

972
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

973
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:20,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

974
01:20:20,141 --> 01:20:22,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I found a couple of others.

975
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:22,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

976
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:23,623
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?

977
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:27,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch ones and one of them for the Mac specifically.

978
01:20:27,225 --> 01:20:28,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like different types of emulator.

979
01:20:28,506 --> 01:20:29,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

980
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:39,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they literally use emulators on like, I would love them to say, well, emulate, let's come to the conclusion that emulators are only for piracy.

981
01:20:39,671 --> 01:20:45,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can go, well, then why the hell are you using emulators on your software then?

982
01:20:45,775 --> 01:20:46,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair question.

983
01:20:46,696 --> 01:20:48,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not even developed by Nintendo.

984
01:20:48,537 --> 01:20:50,538
[SPEAKER_02]: They are licensed.

985
01:20:50,538 --> 01:20:55,681
[SPEAKER_02]: To them to use, they're developed by other people like.

986
01:20:55,681 --> 01:20:57,763
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't make it, you can't have the argument both ways.

987
01:20:58,632 --> 01:21:00,216
[SPEAKER_03]: You should join the legal team, Loki.

988
01:21:00,216 --> 01:21:00,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great argument.

989
01:21:04,314 --> 01:21:07,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Burn them to the ground, they're stupid.

990
01:21:07,597 --> 01:21:14,403
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they treat people over social media and all their stupid legalese with YouTube and all that stuff.

991
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:23,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, this company is... I think they need to take an L here pretty soon to be humbled and come back to the way things are.

992
01:21:23,572 --> 01:21:27,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now they're getting too high on their horse and they really need to be kicked down.

993
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.

994
01:21:28,897 --> 01:21:42,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Highjack the conversation, but kinda, because when you talk about Nintendo taking an L, my brain is going back, I'm sorry, but to PAL world, because I'm kinda sitting here going, how has there not been a lawsuit still?

995
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have fully expected it would happen.

996
01:21:46,112 --> 01:21:46,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different game.

997
01:21:46,873 --> 01:21:47,213
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

998
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:50,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized I am hijacking the conversation completely.

999
01:21:50,236 --> 01:21:56,722
[SPEAKER_03]: But like with everything that came out about powers, I'm kind of shocked that Nintendo hasn't pursued it legally.

1000
01:21:56,722 --> 01:22:05,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, maybe it's still maybe I haven't given it enough time, which I'm, I'm kind of shocked, to be honest.

1001
01:22:05,309 --> 01:22:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I it's, I'm worried, in a way about the precedent setting.

1002
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:11,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1003
01:22:11,707 --> 01:22:20,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think there is a strong argument to make about how much art Palworld is liberally borrowing, we'll say.

1004
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:26,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's hard to say because I get it that things are similar to each other.

1005
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:32,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But also you could say that, you know, they're inspired by real world animals.

1006
01:22:32,106 --> 01:22:34,608
[SPEAKER_02]: They're inspired by objects.

1007
01:22:34,608 --> 01:22:39,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They're inspired by mythological creatures that we all have artwork that represents that stuff.

1008
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:46,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, if you make two things in a similar art style based off of the same thing, they are going to look similar.

1009
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:51,039
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not identical unless they are caught like literally taking the

1010
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:58,528
[SPEAKER_02]: physical models from Nintendo's games and using them in their games and doing something with it.

1011
01:22:58,528 --> 01:23:00,070
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing they can do about it.

1012
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:06,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They can whine and bitch about it all they want, but in the end, PAL World, I'm sorry, is going to be a better game, I guess.

1013
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:08,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope that, let's hope your new one's good.

1014
01:23:09,253 --> 01:23:16,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to see where the industry sort of takes this thing because to be fair, to be fair, Vampire Survivors had the same thing.

1015
01:23:16,596 --> 01:23:21,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just nobody cared because Konami hasn't really done anything with Castlevania in years and years and years.

1016
01:23:21,438 --> 01:23:23,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's it's yeah, it's a different thing.

1017
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:29,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people kind of look at it differently because like, oh, well, Vampire Survivors is such a different game.

1018
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:33,462
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't it's not really very little to do with Castlevania, but it literally lists like it's

1019
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,884
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell me you don't see Castlevania and Vampire Survivors.

1020
01:23:36,884 --> 01:23:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about Vampire Survivors or are you talking about, what's the other one?

1021
01:23:41,946 --> 01:23:47,508
[SPEAKER_02]: The one by the same creator that's in the same style.

1022
01:23:47,508 --> 01:23:50,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Vampire Survivors is very different.

1023
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about Vampire Survivors.

1024
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

1025
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:55,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're talking about people

1026
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:59,504
[SPEAKER_02]: literally borrowing from other IP.

1027
01:23:59,504 --> 01:24:02,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Foam Stars, there's one.

1028
01:24:02,206 --> 01:24:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's essentially Splatoon.

1029
01:24:04,387 --> 01:24:09,190
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but no, it's it's not it's not the actual assets, right?

1030
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the squid kids.

1031
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:18,875
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a there's and I understand, but it's to what, like, literally, we're just saying they did something kind of similar, but to put a twist on it, that's Foam Stars.

1032
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:21,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's mad at Foam Stars over the AI album art thing.

1033
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,037
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a totally different issue.

1034
01:24:23,037 --> 01:24:25,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's bloodstained.

1035
01:24:25,398 --> 01:24:26,099
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was thinking.

1036
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:30,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, I don't, I don't think, no, it's nothing to do with Bloodstained and Castlevania.

1037
01:24:30,914 --> 01:24:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those two are, they are legally distinct.

1038
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:37,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, look at the art in Vampire Survivors and play the game.

1039
01:24:37,059 --> 01:24:40,222
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, you see like sprites that come out of Castlevania stuff.

1040
01:24:40,222 --> 01:24:43,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I'm, I'm only saying that I liked Vampire Survivors.

1041
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:45,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of my favorite games that came out that year.

1042
01:24:45,106 --> 01:24:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, go back and listen.

1043
01:24:46,187 --> 01:24:46,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.

1044
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:53,213
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is, I'm just saying, this is an interesting question that the industry is going to have to face sooner rather than later.

1045
01:24:53,213 --> 01:25:03,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am surprised that Nintendo is not, because they're sure leading a charge against this emulator where the case is kind of rocky here, right?

1046
01:25:03,321 --> 01:25:06,004
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not going after PAL world still?

1047
01:25:06,004 --> 01:25:07,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little bit surprised.

1048
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:08,766
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1049
01:25:08,766 --> 01:25:10,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it's right or wrong.

1050
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:11,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just fucking surprised.

1051
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the SSJ-100 PAL world is fizzled in terms of player concurrency.

1052
01:25:19,523 --> 01:25:21,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, though, the devs are totally cool with that.

1053
01:25:21,964 --> 01:25:23,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they care about petty?

1054
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:24,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no.

1055
01:25:24,645 --> 01:25:27,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we think Nintendo actually cares about being petty or not?

1056
01:25:27,727 --> 01:25:29,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Nintendo is good to be petty.

1057
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:32,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being petty right here with the whole emulator thing.

1058
01:25:32,529 --> 01:25:33,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think

1059
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:41,886
[SPEAKER_02]: The devs are completely fine with people not, because Palworld, it's just, it's not a live service game or anything like that.

1060
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:44,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, has a start and an end, and then you're done.

1061
01:25:44,487 --> 01:25:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: You play through the content, cool.

1062
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:51,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll add more content later on as, you know, things develop on it, because it's still, I think, early access or whatever.

1063
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're totally fine.

1064
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they've made comments to the fact that they were completely fine with the numbers going down.

1065
01:25:58,652 --> 01:26:03,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think it's very simple why the number of concurrent players has dropped significantly.

1066
01:26:03,736 --> 01:26:05,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very simple answer.

1067
01:26:05,757 --> 01:26:11,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody bought the game because gaming media told them it was Pokemon in HD, and then they downloaded it and played it.

1068
01:26:11,422 --> 01:26:12,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, sorry, Pokemon with guns.

1069
01:26:12,703 --> 01:26:13,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot this.

1070
01:26:13,443 --> 01:26:15,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody bought it because they thought it was Pokemon with guns.

1071
01:26:15,685 --> 01:26:18,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they all went and played it and thought, this has nothing to do with Pokemon.

1072
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,088
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't fucking Pokemon.

1073
01:26:20,088 --> 01:26:21,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And they stopped playing.

1074
01:26:21,829 --> 01:26:22,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1075
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think the answer is a lot more simple.

1076
01:26:25,712 --> 01:26:28,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's necessarily that they stopped playing because they didn't like it.

1077
01:26:28,834 --> 01:26:30,415
[SPEAKER_02]: They stopped playing because they're done with it.

1078
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:31,676
[SPEAKER_02]: They played through the game.

1079
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:33,577
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's enough people.

1080
01:26:33,577 --> 01:26:35,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like nobody's playing it.

1081
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's stabilized a bit.

1082
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:42,823
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there was a lot of people that bought into the Pokemon with gun shit that just didn't stay for the long ride.

1083
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:43,304
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1084
01:26:43,304 --> 01:26:44,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1085
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:44,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1086
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:47,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not everybody just plays one game all the time.

1087
01:26:47,326 --> 01:26:52,590
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that do play multiple games and sometimes you just finish the game and you go on to something else.

1088
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:52,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1089
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:58,061
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, um, Zen Monkey says, what's the name of that Splatoon clone?

1090
01:26:58,061 --> 01:26:59,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're thinking about Foam Stars.

1091
01:26:59,682 --> 01:27:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember, and again, I again, I don't think you can say I don't think Nintendo has anything to say in the Foam Stars argument.

1092
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:07,346
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing there.

1093
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:10,468
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to talk negative about Foam Stars, look at the AI shit.

1094
01:27:10,828 --> 01:27:34,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but like Foam Stars is you're instead of putting ink on the ground the foam builds up and that becomes a very important component is that that that the foam it changes some of the physics and does different things with it because I did play the early access and know enough from that that it's it's different enough from Splatoon plus it also more takes the overwatch approach where you don't have a homogenous

1095
01:27:35,829 --> 01:27:42,934
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S in chat says I played POW World, I deleted it after 20 minutes, I realized that I don't like survival-like games.

1096
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:43,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You have succinctly made my point.

1097
01:28:07,506 --> 01:28:09,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

1098
01:28:09,407 --> 01:28:10,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this story.

1099
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:13,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockstar, Loki.

1100
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like I completely feel this.

1101
01:28:16,132 --> 01:28:31,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently Rockstar Games is ordering their employees back into the office after being remote for a very long time to help with finishing up, I guess, Grand Theft Auto 6.

1102
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:35,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So the company is mandating apparently that they return the office for five days a week starting in April.

1103
01:28:39,312 --> 01:28:42,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar Games has found tangible benefits from bodies being in office seats.

1104
01:28:56,323 --> 01:28:56,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that.

1105
01:28:56,923 --> 01:29:07,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, if my company ever says, oh, we're going in the office, which we can't because we've already sold off buildings, but if I ever get a whiff that they're going to do that, I'm out.

1106
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:19,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, what sucks, though, is a lot of employees, one, they've enjoyed the work-life balance that they have with remote work, and two, some don't necessarily live near those offices.

1107
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:21,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly,

1108
01:29:22,225 --> 01:29:34,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Being that they're at the end of the development cycle for the game, what companies have done recently, not necessarily this company, but other companies have done, is they've

1109
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:43,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandated return to office things because they know people quit because they don't want to go back to the office and then that we don't have to pay severances.

1110
01:29:43,522 --> 01:29:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may also be what this is considering we just had 7,000.

1111
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good theory, actually, because that's how Rockstar keeps their name out of the news with the whole layoff thing.

1112
01:29:56,827 --> 01:29:57,067
[SPEAKER_03]: and Drew.

1113
01:30:07,677 --> 01:30:11,200
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, make them crunch for this stuff as well.

1114
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:28,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said, you know, speaking anonymously, many of the employees have reiterated that, you know, working from home has been a lifeline to many of us, that they need to rethink their reckless decision about making and engage with their staff.

1115
01:30:28,395 --> 01:30:35,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That also they fear that they'll have to work late hours in the office, which would mean they would miss out on spending time with their families.

1116
01:30:35,641 --> 01:30:35,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So

1117
01:30:38,001 --> 01:30:41,703
[SPEAKER_03]: The IWGB Game Workers Union at Rockstar are pushing for transparency over paying promotions at health

1118
01:31:00,971 --> 01:31:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: a healthy and inclusive workplace culture, work-life balance centered around what each worker needs.

1119
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:14,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said it's unacceptable for Rockstar leadership to have gone back on their word time and time and time again and have ignored workers' requests for basic working conditions.

1120
01:31:14,278 --> 01:31:26,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Workers across the industry are done with letting executives make reckless and harmful decisions about Rockstar workers and are showing us the start of what can come if they're continually ignored.

1121
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:29,126
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no better time than now to join the union.

1122
01:31:30,441 --> 01:31:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1123
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:41,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto 6 that trailer that came out not that long ago looks really good.

1124
01:31:41,311 --> 01:31:45,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like a good chunk of that was made at home.

1125
01:31:45,152 --> 01:31:50,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm I mean, I'm sure that game has been in for years and years, including prior to COVID.

1126
01:31:50,614 --> 01:31:56,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game looks great and doesn't seem to have been affected negatively by the work from home.

1127
01:31:56,515 --> 01:32:02,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very, you know, but the whole work from home thing, I think is going to be I don't know, it's

1128
01:32:04,417 --> 01:32:18,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to sit here and say it's going to be something where employees will choose and the, you know, employees will, that'll be a selling feature basically for a company and that, you know, people with a lot of talent will tend to gravitate towards those organizations.

1129
01:32:18,345 --> 01:32:25,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But I say that yet in the face of all these layoffs happening, I'm not so sure it's that simple, unfortunately.

1130
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, and I would hate to think Rockstar is making an opportunity of that situation to do this.

1131
01:32:35,774 --> 01:32:36,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1132
01:32:42,782 --> 01:32:45,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Octopath Traveler was delisted on the eshop!

1133
01:33:07,637 --> 01:33:10,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that's likely why the game was delisted.

1134
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:12,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll come back shortly.

1135
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:16,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the the issue I was gonna say problem, but it's not really a problem.

1136
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:21,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Acquire was purchased by from software, right?

1137
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:26,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So because we were like, well, are they gonna make like a Dark Souls version of Octopath?

1138
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:27,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's happening.

1139
01:33:27,952 --> 01:33:30,914
[SPEAKER_03]: But I because of that purchase,

1140
01:33:31,474 --> 01:33:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Nintendo in the credits of the screen right now being the publisher of the game.

1141
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:48,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they probably pulled it down to make a small little change to the loading screen of that game where FromSoftware is now going to show on future copies of the game.

1142
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:56,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as simple of a patch because Nintendo published the games that you bought prior to 2024, and their logo should still be there,

1143
01:33:57,458 --> 01:34:03,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But anything you buy after 2024 in this thing will have the new publisher's logo on it.

1144
01:34:03,323 --> 01:34:10,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think this is just one of those weird, weird things that causes the sensational headline of game is delisted from store.

1145
01:34:10,969 --> 01:34:15,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just because they did a poor job communicating it and letting us know how long it was going to be down.

1146
01:34:15,252 --> 01:34:20,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is obviously just a side effect of the the transaction that just happened and it'll be back.

1147
01:34:20,937 --> 01:34:22,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So meanwhile,

1148
01:34:22,967 --> 01:34:25,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Visible copies of the game don't change.

1149
01:34:25,009 --> 01:34:25,629
[SPEAKER_03]: They still work.

1150
01:34:25,629 --> 01:34:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital copies that you already bought work, to be fair.

1151
01:34:27,691 --> 01:34:30,193
[SPEAKER_03]: This only affects new sales of the game.

1152
01:34:30,193 --> 01:34:31,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1153
01:34:31,494 --> 01:34:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But how many people are still buying Octopath Traveler Part 1 when 2 is already out there?

1154
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:39,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And even 2 is a year or two old at this point.

1155
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:46,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but you know, for game preservation purposes, the original should be available.

1156
01:34:46,928 --> 01:34:49,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can also get it on

1157
01:34:50,481 --> 01:34:54,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna say PC, but I'm not sure if it's more accurate to say Steam.

1158
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:59,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's multi-platform on the PC universe or not.

1159
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:00,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1160
01:35:00,311 --> 01:35:05,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, DarkSakura.

1161
01:35:05,115 --> 01:35:07,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have Gudon.

1162
01:35:07,317 --> 01:35:09,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky.

1163
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:09,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

1164
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:16,062
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing about video games that we love is the music.

1165
01:35:16,062 --> 01:35:20,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the games that really just have the best music ever

1166
01:35:21,781 --> 01:35:26,725
[SPEAKER_06]: are the Final Fantasy games and some of those like that.

1167
01:35:26,725 --> 01:35:43,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we can't have that music without the legend Uematsu Nobuo, who is just an amazing, amazing music creator, composer, very talented person.

1168
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,861
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's now saying that

1169
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:51,966
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't think he'll be able to do full video game soundtracks.

1170
01:35:51,966 --> 01:36:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: He says that he felt that if nostalgia would take over, he might do it.

1171
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:14,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But he is more... I mean, actually, he says he doesn't really see it happening, but he's more inclined to do something like a main theme or some of the overlying theme music for a game.

1172
01:36:17,348 --> 01:36:26,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said that, you know, it's something that you have to give all of your energy to and he just doesn't have the fortitude anymore.

1173
01:36:29,193 --> 01:36:45,171
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's like, and he did the last game he did a full soundtrack for was Fantasian, the game that I've been playing for a while, which is freaking great.

1174
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:48,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was also created by Sakaguchi.

1175
01:36:51,256 --> 01:37:01,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But who had even said in 2021 that he felt like it could be Uematsu's last soundtrack, so a little bit prophetic there.

1176
01:37:01,142 --> 01:37:05,965
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, and that soundtrack was like a 60-piece orchestra soundtrack.

1177
01:37:05,965 --> 01:37:15,671
[SPEAKER_06]: For the record, by the way, as a little aside, there is a Steam database entry for Fantasian, so folks on Steam might be able to get to play it.

1178
01:37:15,671 --> 01:37:17,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Just throwing that out there.

1179
01:37:17,012 --> 01:37:17,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great game.

1180
01:37:19,446 --> 01:37:26,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But at any rate, yeah, he's going to still be doing some of his conducting gigs.

1181
01:37:26,089 --> 01:37:36,113
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new conducting gig coming up with the Marignane Heart of Ice.

1182
01:37:36,113 --> 01:37:40,515
[SPEAKER_06]: But that might just be it.

1183
01:37:40,515 --> 01:37:45,917
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just planning on doing the stuff that his heart is in and doing some main themes and that's it.

1184
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:47,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1185
01:37:47,726 --> 01:37:49,988
[SPEAKER_03]: The man's turning 65 this week.

1186
01:37:49,988 --> 01:37:51,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Let him retire.

1187
01:37:51,369 --> 01:37:52,009
[SPEAKER_03]: He's earned it.

1188
01:37:52,009 --> 01:37:54,390
[SPEAKER_03]: He's more than earned it.

1189
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:56,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for real.

1190
01:37:56,331 --> 01:38:11,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the record, I was going to say, going back to Fantasian real quick, it was a scene on SteamDB as listed on there, but it was done by Studio Mistwalker.

1191
01:38:13,038 --> 01:38:20,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and on the, you know, Uematsu and, you know, the, his, his legacy or what have you, you know what, Final Fantasy will be fine.

1192
01:38:20,065 --> 01:38:23,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Soken is doing amazing work with XIV.

1193
01:38:23,528 --> 01:38:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: XVI was, was fine.

1194
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, XIV is especially is great.

1195
01:38:27,452 --> 01:38:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I don't know who did, maybe somebody could tell me in chat, uh, especially the recent VII Rebirth.

1196
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was the same composer that did Remake.

1197
01:38:37,622 --> 01:38:37,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Square Enix

1198
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:58,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster in chat says Uematsu deserves a rest.

1199
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:03,015
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done so much and has made a huge multi-generational mark for so many.

1200
01:39:03,015 --> 01:39:08,880
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100mat says he said that it takes 2-3 years of non-stop work to make a soundtrack.

1201
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,143
[SPEAKER_03]: He's tired and deserves the rest and consult when he wants to.

1202
01:39:13,143 --> 01:39:16,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he had health stuff so if anyone deserves time, it's him.

1203
01:39:17,987 --> 01:39:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much that.

1204
01:39:19,128 --> 01:39:27,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think back to the memes of the creator of Smash Brothers where it says, Never ask me for anything ever again.

1205
01:39:27,476 --> 01:39:28,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just tired.

1206
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:30,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to sleep.

1207
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:31,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Sakurai.

1208
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:31,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

1209
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Those those memes of Sakurai.

1210
01:39:33,162 --> 01:39:34,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Never ask me for anything ever again.

1211
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:37,146
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1212
01:39:37,146 --> 01:39:38,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1213
01:39:38,587 --> 01:39:39,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to Loki.

1214
01:39:40,526 --> 01:39:42,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about more cancelled things.

1215
01:39:42,547 --> 01:40:00,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I completely forgot that Respawn was working on a Star Wars game at EA, but apparently, uh, they were until now they're not because, uh, apparently Respawn or IGN reported that Respawn's in development Star Wars FPS game has been cancelled.

1216
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:02,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's unfortunate.

1217
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think a lot of this comes from the layoffs, cutting projects and whatnot.

1218
01:40:09,648 --> 01:40:13,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been cool to see, but we're just never going to see it.

1219
01:40:15,605 --> 01:40:18,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Artwork from the game leaks out on people's resumes.

1220
01:40:18,608 --> 01:40:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I wonder if this is one of those things where again Perhaps the game was designed to be one of these games as a service it being an EA game and a Star Wars I'm sure it was it was planning to take dollars out of your wallet Consistently and without shame and I wonder if somebody said you know what?

1221
01:40:40,646 --> 01:40:44,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we're going to have a battlefront two on our hands type of situation.

1222
01:40:44,008 --> 01:40:46,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, they could change that before release.

1223
01:40:46,369 --> 01:40:51,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, you know, there's got to be something a little more with how the game was playing or coming along or something.

1224
01:40:51,152 --> 01:40:55,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't want to lie to the layoff situation either, but it's just the thing is just interesting.

1225
01:40:55,514 --> 01:40:56,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all interesting.

1226
01:40:56,614 --> 01:41:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: They said part of it was because EA's decision to pivot away from licensed IP.

1227
01:41:02,257 --> 01:41:02,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1228
01:41:02,878 --> 01:41:08,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Which they don't feel will be successful in the changing industry.

1229
01:41:08,841 --> 01:41:08,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1230
01:41:11,157 --> 01:41:16,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't agree with that, but I mean, sure, you can make an uninformed guess of that.

1231
01:41:16,221 --> 01:41:17,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

1232
01:41:17,762 --> 01:41:19,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man seems to be doing pretty well.

1233
01:41:19,863 --> 01:41:20,564
[SPEAKER_02]: That's licensed.

1234
01:41:20,564 --> 01:41:24,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, it's technically owned IP, but it's kind of licensed.

1235
01:41:24,566 --> 01:41:28,869
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's I wonder if it's a little more complicated than that.

1236
01:41:28,869 --> 01:41:36,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a dig at how much they're paying for Star Wars and they want to renegotiate said rate.

1237
01:41:36,434 --> 01:41:37,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give EA anything.

1238
01:41:39,864 --> 01:41:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: don't just don't give them anything.

1239
01:41:42,726 --> 01:41:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the EA that they used to be.

1240
01:41:44,627 --> 01:41:46,589
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the EA of now and they suck.

1241
01:41:46,589 --> 01:41:50,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So just don't don't give them anything.

1242
01:41:50,091 --> 01:41:55,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in my day should have back in my day it was ECA.

1243
01:41:55,095 --> 01:41:56,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1244
01:41:56,796 --> 01:41:59,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about something else that could be the future of gaming.

1245
01:41:59,918 --> 01:42:06,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that Microsoft has been talking about in a partnership with Nvidia, AMD and Intel when in regards to

1246
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:10,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Upscaling Support in Upcoming PC Games

1247
01:42:28,519 --> 01:42:56,260
[SPEAKER_03]: that this is where we would rather see AI sort of used is these sorts of situations, not where it's creating the art, but able to adapt and upscale the art based on being trained on said art, you know, so that AI is just, you know, essentially, you know, what it is, the automation of processes happening very quickly, very, very quickly in regards to rendering graphics and, you know, delivering through this direct SR API.

1248
01:42:57,361 --> 01:43:01,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I use software that already has the ability to do that.

1249
01:43:01,023 --> 01:43:02,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Pixelmator.

1250
01:43:02,523 --> 01:43:13,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It has the ability, when you resize something, invoking super resolution, which is literally what it's called.

1251
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:19,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in the case of... What's the word I'm thinking of?

1252
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:20,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Reducing size.

1253
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:23,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of getting some of the fuzzy...

1254
01:43:24,913 --> 01:43:26,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of weird scaling.

1255
01:43:26,837 --> 01:43:33,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It cleans it up, but it also does the same thing for enlarging, although I haven't tried a massive re-large in it.

1256
01:43:33,008 --> 01:43:34,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's been there.

1257
01:43:34,089 --> 01:43:36,133
[SPEAKER_06]: The ability's been there.

1258
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:37,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been using it for at least a year.

1259
01:43:38,599 --> 01:43:49,466
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Resolution feature was spotted in a test version of Windows 11, which is supposed to be using AI to make supported games play more smoothly with enhanced details.

1260
01:43:49,466 --> 01:43:52,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So this API is going to play into this.

1261
01:43:52,688 --> 01:43:57,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this is going to be available soon via a preview of the Agility SDK.

1262
01:43:57,211 --> 01:44:02,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And there will be a sneak peek of all of this at GDC, which remember is just around the corner.

1263
01:44:03,115 --> 01:44:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular session at GDC is going to be March 21st.

1264
01:44:06,577 --> 01:44:10,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD all participating.

1265
01:44:10,759 --> 01:44:26,147
[SPEAKER_03]: This is definitely one to watch, I think, because I think this is very much how we're talking about how video games are going to get to 8K and, you know, even even more frames a second and all this stuff, you know, even more and more lifelike.

1266
01:44:26,147 --> 01:44:29,529
[SPEAKER_03]: One step closer to the holodeck, if we will.

1267
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:31,210
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be an interesting one to watch for sure.

1268
01:44:32,486 --> 01:44:43,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we're going to go to our next segment, which has a twist this year, because every month DarkSakura talks about a game that didn't see the light of day.

1269
01:44:43,634 --> 01:44:45,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the cancelled game of the month.

1270
01:44:45,915 --> 01:44:47,877
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we get there, let's play The Bump.

1271
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:06,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1272
01:45:06,368 --> 01:45:10,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1273
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:10,550
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1274
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:14,132
[SPEAKER_03]: But as mentioned, it is a cancelled classic game.

1275
01:45:14,132 --> 01:45:19,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, what is the classic cancelled game of the month?

1276
01:45:19,135 --> 01:45:21,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Robotech Crystal Dreams.

1277
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:21,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And hi, Nelly.

1278
01:45:26,512 --> 01:45:35,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it is a cancelled Robotech game that was in development for the Nintendo 64 by Gametech.

1279
01:45:35,554 --> 01:45:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am calling it Robotech because it started its life as a Robotech game, not as a Macross game.

1280
01:45:41,535 --> 01:45:42,856
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll get into that in a second.

1281
01:45:43,676 --> 01:45:56,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, the overall plot of this is that you play as someone named Kyle Bartley, who was a Veritech pilot who had been disgraced.

1282
01:45:56,059 --> 01:46:04,001
[SPEAKER_06]: He was former Robotech Defense Force, and he turned into a mercenary, but then he, I guess, worked to try to still

1283
01:46:06,101 --> 01:46:10,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Protect the Earth and the SDF3, the Super Defense Fortress.

1284
01:46:10,685 --> 01:46:11,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what they called it.

1285
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:13,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't watch a lot of real Robotech.

1286
01:46:13,206 --> 01:46:21,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I've mostly watched Macross from Zentradi enemies, who were giant kind of blue-purple people sometimes.

1287
01:46:21,733 --> 01:46:30,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so let's go a little bit into the gameplay of this, and then we're going to go into

1288
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,082
[SPEAKER_06]: the development history.

1289
01:46:33,082 --> 01:46:40,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So Crystal Dreams was a space fighter simulation, had some resource management to it.

1290
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:49,816
[SPEAKER_06]: You basically, your character Kyle, works as a mercenary, like I said, and could obtain credits based on the type of missions that were completed.

1291
01:46:49,816 --> 01:46:57,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And between levels you go back to your base and you can interact with different characters, buy upgrades, modify your mecha.

1292
01:46:59,324 --> 01:47:06,868
[SPEAKER_06]: You also had a war timeline where you could get reports of what was happening at different places in space.

1293
01:47:06,868 --> 01:47:10,689
[SPEAKER_06]: You could go help people who need it and get any more credits for it.

1294
01:47:10,689 --> 01:47:18,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, you have your three modes for your... They called them Veritex.

1295
01:47:18,753 --> 01:47:23,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Or... Yeah, anyway.

1296
01:47:23,255 --> 01:47:26,557
[SPEAKER_06]: You had your Fighter Mode, your Guardian Mode, and Battleloid Mode.

1297
01:47:28,462 --> 01:47:30,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1298
01:47:30,684 --> 01:47:44,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, going into a little bit of... For the record, by the way, the Veritecs were called Valkyries in Macross.

1299
01:47:46,468 --> 01:48:01,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, and those three different modes, uh, there was, uh, the fighter mode, and then you had Gerwalk mode, which I thought was funny for- it was so funny because we were actually, uh, looking at, uh,

1300
01:48:03,127 --> 01:48:10,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking of Jetfire toys, and the first Jetfire toy was actually a repurposed Macross Valkyrie.

1301
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:13,111
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thought that was funny.

1302
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:20,915
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, and then the... But there was also, like, the human-ish kind of mode.

1303
01:48:20,915 --> 01:48:22,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there we go.

1304
01:48:22,355 --> 01:48:25,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, going back to the game... Oh, sorry, I love Macross.

1305
01:48:26,545 --> 01:48:36,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to the game, the license was purchased from Activision by Gametech and so they pitched a game to Nintendo and Nintendo approved it.

1306
01:48:36,871 --> 01:48:39,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a 10 person team to work on it.

1307
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:52,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It was announced in May 1995 as a launch game with the title Robotech Academy and then by 1986, middle of the year, it changed to Robotech Crystal Dreams.

1308
01:48:54,190 --> 01:49:08,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo gave support to GameTek to learn the hardware and the art director Mimi Doggett, I'll read this quote, they know we're just getting used to this new hardware so they've been patiently supportive.

1309
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:12,702
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not pushing us to get the game out, they'd rather we take our time to make sure that it's good.

1310
01:49:14,362 --> 01:49:25,205
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it was planned for a December 1996 release, and then rescheduled to second quarter 1997, and then further delayed to December 1997.

1311
01:49:25,205 --> 01:49:33,907
[SPEAKER_06]: After that, though, GameTech filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early December 1997, after the game had been in development for two years.

1312
01:49:36,788 --> 01:49:51,454
[SPEAKER_06]: They were saying that the development of the game was not going to affect the bankruptcy, but by 1997 Ocean acquired the rights to the game and they were going to finish and release it, but they cancelled after a working demo was shown at the 1998 E3.

1313
01:49:54,536 --> 01:50:05,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And Arctic Press had a black and white promotional comic book that was handed out at E3, very much a collector's item now, and then Gametech was liquidated in 1998.

1314
01:50:05,285 --> 01:50:14,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for the one thing I found where one of the programmers had a lot of

1315
01:50:15,799 --> 01:50:16,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it was really sad.

1316
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,342
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people were looking forward to it, including

1317
01:50:33,095 --> 01:50:36,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomy of Japan.

1318
01:50:36,157 --> 01:50:43,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We're familiar with Tomy as like a toy and development company.

1319
01:50:43,101 --> 01:50:54,268
[SPEAKER_06]: They were localizing that into a game called Super Dimension Fortress Macross Another Dimension or Chōjiku Yōsai Macrossu Anaza Dimension.

1320
01:50:54,268 --> 01:50:55,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Another Dimension, so mostly English.

1321
01:50:56,890 --> 01:51:07,701
[SPEAKER_06]: But at any rate, the thing that they were about this is that it was a chance to have the only Macross game released on Japanese Nintendo 64.

1322
01:51:10,546 --> 01:51:25,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the mecha that were used in Crystal Dreams came right from original Macross, not from, like, most beta or any of the others that were used to continue Macross for the animation.

1323
01:51:25,295 --> 01:51:28,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were pretty all about it.

1324
01:51:28,177 --> 01:51:35,622
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when GameTek never completed the game and closed down, that, of course, stuck a wrench in plans.

1325
01:51:37,843 --> 01:51:57,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Tommy still wanted to continue with taking it over and they had advertised it in Japanese magazines But Bandai did not release the rights to them to distribute it and so that fizzled in Japan as well and so that's That's it.

1326
01:51:57,940 --> 01:52:01,623
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the story of You know Robotech

1327
01:52:03,058 --> 01:52:03,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1328
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:22,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Alas.

1329
01:52:38,959 --> 01:52:42,461
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a PC game of the era, to be honest.

1330
01:52:42,461 --> 01:52:52,488
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as I'm aware, the music would be like, you know, of course, Nintendo style digitized versions of the original music from the Macross series.

1331
01:52:53,757 --> 01:52:59,278
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, which, if I recall correctly, now keep in mind, I have not watched a lot of Robotech.

1332
01:52:59,278 --> 01:53:00,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I've watched a lot of Macross.

1333
01:53:00,618 --> 01:53:06,260
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, didn't Robotech use a lot of the music that was in Macross?

1334
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:06,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1335
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:16,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that some, I know that some localized anime did that a bit, like going back and watching GeForce.

1336
01:53:16,202 --> 01:53:22,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a lot of that same repeated, terrible intro music for the US one, but during fight scenes, it totally plays the Gatchaman music.

1337
01:53:23,854 --> 01:53:26,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs

1338
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:42,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ranma.

1339
01:53:42,786 --> 01:53:44,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1340
01:53:44,128 --> 01:53:54,601
[SPEAKER_06]: But we noticed that like some of the music from the Japanese version was reused in the American one in different spots.

1341
01:53:54,601 --> 01:53:59,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the record, the theme song for that in Japanese is Total 80s and it's a vibe.

1342
01:54:00,881 --> 01:54:02,942
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, you triggered Fifth Dream's memories there.

1343
01:54:02,942 --> 01:54:05,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth Dream in chat saying, me, I love that show.

1344
01:54:05,323 --> 01:54:08,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Saber Rider, the song is in my, I have no idea how it goes, so I can join you.

1345
01:54:08,805 --> 01:54:15,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Saber Rider, and the Star Sheriff's whip crack.

1346
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:22,672
[SPEAKER_06]: It also had Peter Cullen in like one role as Ramrod and that was it.

1347
01:54:25,034 --> 01:54:28,558
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, your classic canceled game of the month.

1348
01:54:28,558 --> 01:54:31,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Our regular segment will resume next week.

1349
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,324
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is always a fun- Wait, we need a moment of silence.

1350
01:54:34,324 --> 01:54:38,648

[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's get into some other news rapidly in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have the original Unreal is getting an RTX Remix that allows you to have lots of shiny lights.

[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1361
01:55:39,035 --> 01:55:48,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can play Doom on, I'm gonna try to pronounce this, it is clearly a foreign name, a Husqvarna lawnmower.

1362
01:55:48,910 --> 01:55:49,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a $2,000 lawnmower.

1363
01:55:49,932 --> 01:55:53,097
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a tech and construction brand.

1364
01:55:54,602 --> 01:55:57,304
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks it looks very futuristic as it is.

1365
01:55:57,304 --> 01:55:58,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you play.

1366
01:55:58,485 --> 01:56:00,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it has a screen on it.

1367
01:56:00,127 --> 01:56:02,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you would do that.

1368
01:56:02,749 --> 01:56:03,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It says.

1369
01:56:03,529 --> 01:56:11,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But will the will the lawnmower motor play the doom thing?

1370
01:56:11,055 --> 01:56:13,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Can it can it actually rev to the theme?

1371
01:56:13,397 --> 01:56:14,998
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1372
01:56:14,998 --> 01:56:17,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the blades are spinning when you use a chainsaw.

1373
01:56:17,641 --> 01:56:19,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be scary.

1374
01:56:22,168 --> 01:56:25,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I don't know.

1375
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:29,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat that you can do that.

1376
01:56:29,112 --> 01:56:32,494
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's coming in April.

1377
01:56:32,494 --> 01:56:34,776
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll allow you to do that.

1378
01:56:34,776 --> 01:56:39,319
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what do you have?

1379
01:56:39,319 --> 01:56:40,459
[SPEAKER_05]: The best news ever.

1380
01:56:41,747 --> 01:56:42,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.

1381
01:56:42,567 --> 01:56:45,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And the most expensive news for me and my house.

1382
01:56:45,908 --> 01:56:54,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So Multimorphic is a pinball company that does their P3 table and P3 is a modular pinball.

1383
01:56:54,611 --> 01:56:57,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can change out one unit for another.

1384
01:56:57,032 --> 01:56:58,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the Weird Al.

1385
01:56:58,153 --> 01:57:00,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Weird Al machine.

1386
01:57:00,353 --> 01:57:02,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this from Southern Pride Game Expo.

1387
01:57:02,254 --> 01:57:02,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1388
01:57:04,442 --> 01:57:11,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Which has like a video part of the table and then, you know, an upper field and it plays all kinds of fun stuff.

1389
01:57:11,585 --> 01:57:16,528
[SPEAKER_06]: So Multimorphic has announced their next game for P3.

1390
01:57:16,528 --> 01:57:19,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the Princess Bride, dammit!

1391
01:57:19,649 --> 01:57:24,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Inconceivable!

1392
01:57:24,031 --> 01:57:27,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am like, I'm so jazzed.

1393
01:57:29,931 --> 01:57:35,698
[SPEAKER_06]: For a movie that came out in 1997, this is my favorite movie on freaking record.

1394
01:57:35,698 --> 01:57:38,401
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite movie.

1395
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:39,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it more than Xanadu.

1396
01:57:39,863 --> 01:57:40,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it more than Barbarella.

1397
01:57:42,958 --> 01:57:48,362
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has all kinds of stuff from the Kingdom of Florin.

1398
01:57:48,362 --> 01:57:53,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It has the Cliffs of Insanity and the Ball Climbs the Cliff.

1399
01:57:53,226 --> 01:58:00,632
[SPEAKER_06]: You have Miracle Max's Hut, the Fire Swamp with the Rodents of Unusual Size, and Prince Humperdinck's Castle.

1400
01:58:00,632 --> 01:58:01,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Humperdinck!

1401
01:58:01,192 --> 01:58:01,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Humperdinck!

1402
01:58:01,632 --> 01:58:02,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Humperdinck!

1403
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:02,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Humperdinck!

1404
01:58:02,573 --> 01:58:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1405
01:58:05,455 --> 01:58:09,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's... But...

1406
01:58:11,607 --> 01:58:29,582
[SPEAKER_06]: But they, basically, the head of Multimorphic, Jerry Stellenberg, was like, the pinball market's saturated, we know, they're all expensive, but we're putting out the notice now, so if you're really a diehard fan, you get a chance to save for it or whatever you need to do to help you get it.

1407
01:58:30,282 --> 01:58:33,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wanted people to get excited about it.

1408
01:58:33,825 --> 01:58:41,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, the creative director for this is the same person who worked on Weird Al and Heist.

1409
01:58:41,312 --> 01:58:43,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Steven Silver.

1410
01:58:43,193 --> 01:58:50,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also Josh Kugler, formerly from American Pinball, who is their software team lead.

1411
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So they got a pretty good group on it.

1412
01:58:53,922 --> 01:58:54,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to it.

1413
01:58:54,803 --> 01:58:56,364
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the film's music.

1414
01:58:57,324 --> 01:59:01,809
[SPEAKER_06]: which did you know that it was written by Mark Knopfler from Dire Straits?

1415
01:59:01,809 --> 01:59:04,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1416
01:59:04,051 --> 01:59:04,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1417
01:59:04,531 --> 01:59:14,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it had been adapted by Paul Farrer to fit the gameplay and has a few extra tracks that were created just for the game.

1418
01:59:14,761 --> 01:59:18,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it looks

1419
01:59:20,492 --> 01:59:23,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Dust is also a good movie, I would play that as a pinball too

1420
01:59:40,356 --> 01:59:41,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye!

1421
01:59:41,897 --> 01:59:52,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to tell you something from, and it's in the book As You Wish, which was by Cary Elwes, and it's his memoirs of doing the movie.

1422
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:57,442
[SPEAKER_06]: About, you know, a sword fighting with a broken toe, thanks to Andre the Giant.

1423
01:59:57,442 --> 02:00:03,024
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said that the whole scene with Miracle Max was ad-libbed completely with Billy Crystal.

1424
02:00:04,193 --> 02:00:12,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And that he was laughing so hard while he was supposed to be dead that they had to change him out for a model.

1425
02:00:12,408 --> 02:00:12,809
[SPEAKER_06]: For a dummy.

1426
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:18,672
[SPEAKER_06]: and Mandy Patinkin broke a rib holding in his laughter.

1427
02:00:44,201 --> 02:00:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the two of them, like, made the entire scene just how well they played off of each other.

1428
02:00:50,067 --> 02:00:50,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1429
02:00:50,888 --> 02:00:56,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I mean, my favorite thing in there is her going, Humperdinck, Humperdinck, Humperdinck!

1430
02:00:56,494 --> 02:00:58,236
[SPEAKER_06]: But that movie is great.

1431
02:00:58,863 --> 02:01:04,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well moving on, let's talk about the Sega reboots that have been rumored for some time.

1432
02:01:04,506 --> 02:01:09,569
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of the rumors and things, leaks I guess if you will, are really gaining fire.

1433
02:01:09,569 --> 02:01:18,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we'd heard some of this before, that we heard that Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are supposed to be coming as games as a service.

1434
02:01:18,553 --> 02:01:19,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.

1435
02:01:19,614 --> 02:01:24,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So these remakes might not, or reboots I should say, might not be exactly what you think of.

1436
02:01:24,937 --> 02:01:35,584
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently a well-known atlas leaker who had announced the Persona game remakes and so forth has gone to Twitter to talk a little bit about these games.

1437
02:01:35,584 --> 02:01:42,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And that there are not only the games as a service reboots, but there are also remakes

1438
02:01:42,728 --> 02:01:44,309
[SPEAKER_03]: In a series of tweets, the leaker MBKKSSTBHZ5

1439
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:09,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's modeled after AAA live service games like Fortnite.

1440
02:02:09,367 --> 02:02:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plans for live events, collaborations, and customizations.

1441
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:17,976
[SPEAKER_03]: The current plan is to create a live games as a service reboot as well as a remake of Crazy Taxi.

1442
02:02:17,976 --> 02:02:22,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a survival mode with up to 100 players racing in the reboot.

1443
02:02:22,661 --> 02:02:27,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortnite and GTA Online are some of the main inspiration for the current Sega Super Game plan.

1444
02:02:27,726 --> 02:02:33,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega wants to be competitive in the live service scene and use classic IPs in new ways with new technology.

1445
02:02:33,888 --> 02:02:39,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Both Crazy Taxi and Jet Set are live service games that are also having remakes before the reboot's release.

1446
02:02:39,709 --> 02:02:45,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set is closer in gameplay to Fortnite than Crazy Taxi, and there are shooting elements planned.

1447
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:52,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set Reboot has graffiti and shooting gameplay, an open-world concept with exploration as focus.

1448
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:54,353
[SPEAKER_03]: There are new characters and story, too.

1449
02:02:55,951 --> 02:02:57,532
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.

1450
02:02:57,532 --> 02:02:59,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they're doing the remakes as well.

1451
02:02:59,833 --> 02:03:01,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's very smart.

1452
02:03:01,554 --> 02:03:14,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if the gas games servants service if the gas tank is empty, so to speak, they have the remakes to fall back on because I think a lot of people would buy the remakes of both those games.

1453
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:16,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my Hydra Thunder?

1454
02:03:16,741 --> 02:03:18,401
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

1455
02:03:18,401 --> 02:03:23,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was a full but there was that Xbox No, they call this a spiritual successor.

1456
02:03:23,804 --> 02:03:24,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1457
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:30,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I need I need damn the torpedoes.

1458
02:03:30,544 --> 02:03:40,030
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in a game store online near you a little faster than the Sega remakes.

1459
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:40,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with the US.

1460
02:03:40,911 --> 02:03:42,112

[SPEAKER_02]: AncientWeaponHolly on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 UnicornOverlord on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series UnicornOverlord

1467
02:04:45,155 --> 02:04:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

1468
02:04:45,916 --> 02:04:49,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I this that same game is on my Japanese list.

1469
02:04:49,197 --> 02:04:51,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just have to say I think it's false advertising.

1470
02:04:51,919 --> 02:04:57,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an AI Willy Wonka situation because I do not see any fucking unicorns in unicorn overload.

1471
02:04:57,922 --> 02:04:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see a unicorn here?

1472
02:04:59,083 --> 02:05:00,043
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I see.

1473
02:05:00,043 --> 02:05:03,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a furry, but I don't see a unicorn overlord.

1474
02:05:03,125 --> 02:05:04,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is this a game?

1475
02:05:05,166 --> 02:05:21,843
[SPEAKER_03]: it just looks like fucking about tops it's it's just it looks like it's just fucking Suikoden but with a full cooking simulator because of course of course the Japanese has to have realistic cooking mini games in it because of course uh huh

1476
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:26,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing a question, are there unicorns in Unicorn Overlord?

1477
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:36,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it says, you know, that the person, one of the main characters of the game is now an adult and burying the magical ring of the unicorn.

1478
02:05:36,064 --> 02:05:40,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is something unicorn tangentially related to it.

1479
02:05:40,285 --> 02:05:41,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Needs more unicorns.

1480
02:05:43,516 --> 02:05:49,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, also very tangentially... 7 out of 10, not enough unicorns.

1481
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangentially related to Unicorn Overlord.

1482
02:05:52,363 --> 02:06:05,412
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cannot create your own Unicorn Overlord in that game, perhaps in the custom character creator for WWE 2K24, you can create your own wrestler named the Unicorn Overlord on PC.

1483
02:06:05,412 --> 02:06:08,574
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1484
02:06:08,574 --> 02:06:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1485
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:15,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the ssj100 map for making a Last Unicorn, uh, reference.

1486
02:06:15,703 --> 02:06:18,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a bunch of anime shmedrick the magicians.

[SPEAKER_07]: It's a magical leopleurodon!

1492
02:06:33,652 --> 02:06:36,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I just watched that the other day, by the way.

1493
02:06:36,034 --> 02:06:36,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Again.

1494
02:06:37,287 --> 02:06:41,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And why, did you watch, I don't know, Homestar Runner as well?

1495
02:06:41,468 --> 02:06:45,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rejected cartoon by Don Hertzfeldt?

1496
02:06:45,469 --> 02:06:48,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I did watch the rejected cartoon for the record.

1497
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:52,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually was introduced somebody to it.

1498
02:06:52,532 --> 02:06:53,792
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1499
02:06:53,792 --> 02:06:54,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.

1500
02:06:54,252 --> 02:06:56,873
[SPEAKER_07]: My spoon is too big.

1501
02:06:57,501 --> 02:06:58,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a banana.

1502
02:06:58,362 --> 02:07:01,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a banana.

1503
02:07:01,404 --> 02:07:06,667
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you've never seen the rejected cartoon, do yourself a favor.

1504
02:07:06,667 --> 02:07:08,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause the show.

1505
02:07:08,269 --> 02:07:09,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stop.

1506
02:07:09,289 --> 02:07:10,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Dawn Hertzfeld.

1507
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:12,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause the show.

1508
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:14,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stop, but pause it.

1509
02:07:14,013 --> 02:07:16,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Go watch that cartoon and then send us an email.

1510
02:07:16,835 --> 02:07:19,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at OrangeLingerie.com with your thoughts.

1511
02:07:19,837 --> 02:07:22,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want you to know, I saw that

1512
02:07:23,786 --> 02:07:29,007
[SPEAKER_03]: on the big screen years ago, probably high.

1513
02:07:29,007 --> 02:07:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say probably because I wasn't doing weed, but everybody around me was, and there's only so much of that around you you can take.

1514
02:07:37,669 --> 02:07:39,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike and Mike.

1515
02:07:39,109 --> 02:07:40,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was the Spike and Mike.

1516
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:41,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, they don't do those anymore.

1517
02:07:41,690 --> 02:07:43,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Twisted Animation Festival.

1518
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:43,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was it.

1519
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:45,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Spike and Mike.

1520
02:07:45,931 --> 02:07:50,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched it when we were at the first OLR house.

1521
02:07:50,192 --> 02:07:51,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I definitely remember that.

1522
02:07:52,537 --> 02:07:54,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1523
02:08:01,397 --> 02:08:02,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.

1524
02:08:02,819 --> 02:08:05,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just hilarious.

1525
02:08:05,301 --> 02:08:06,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Rejected.

1526
02:08:06,122 --> 02:08:06,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Cartoon.

1527
02:08:06,862 --> 02:08:09,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Don Hertzfeldt will change your life.

1528
02:08:09,405 --> 02:08:10,846
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1529
02:08:10,846 --> 02:08:13,489
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the line, I am a consumer whore comes from.

1530
02:08:13,489 --> 02:08:14,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And how.

1531
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:15,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And how.

1532
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:17,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get to the Japanese release date?

1533
02:08:17,473 --> 02:08:18,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of being a consumer whore.

1534
02:08:18,293 --> 02:08:19,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1535
02:08:19,294 --> 02:08:19,615
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1536
02:08:19,615 --> 02:08:24,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on March the 7th, Irem Collection Volume 1 is coming out.

1537
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:25,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1538
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:25,861
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our type.

1539
02:08:26,241 --> 02:08:30,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, well, I don't think our type is in this collection.

1540
02:08:30,503 --> 02:08:32,884
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Image Fight.

1541
02:08:32,884 --> 02:08:34,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Image Fight's good.

1542
02:08:34,124 --> 02:08:39,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Image Fight 2, Operation Deep Striker, and X Multiply are all in this particular set.

1543
02:08:39,486 --> 02:08:40,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's, that's still fun.

1544
02:08:40,467 --> 02:08:41,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some good games.

1545
02:08:41,707 --> 02:08:42,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Image Fight.

1546
02:08:42,827 --> 02:08:45,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and these games have not been released in the West before.

1547
02:08:45,248 --> 02:08:46,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty fun.

1548
02:08:47,436 --> 02:08:47,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Unicorn Overlord

1549
02:09:15,848 --> 02:09:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel to Europe, DarkSakura!

1550
02:09:20,984 --> 02:09:24,487
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 5th, that's what the next few are.

1552
02:09:30,111 --> 02:09:34,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it's a World War II era game.

1553
02:09:34,054 --> 02:09:37,657
[SPEAKER_06]: For PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, Expedition's a Mudrunner game.

[SPEAKER_06]: On the Big 3, Unicorn Overlord.

1559
02:10:12,482 --> 02:10:14,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of cancelled games,

1560
02:10:15,535 --> 02:10:23,302
[SPEAKER_06]: from before, and this is a game that actually got a release after it was unreleased since 1982.

1561
02:10:23,302 --> 02:10:28,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Akka R Special Edition is going to be on PlayStation.

1562
02:10:28,386 --> 02:10:30,548
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1563
02:10:30,548 --> 02:10:32,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have a few more stories for you.

1564
02:10:33,157 --> 02:10:35,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll get to the listener roundtable if y'all have any questions.

1565
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:38,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea if we have emails.

1566
02:10:38,323 --> 02:10:38,883
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1567
02:10:38,883 --> 02:10:39,144
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1568
02:10:39,144 --> 02:10:39,404
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1569
02:10:39,404 --> 02:10:41,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that makes that easy.

1570
02:10:41,246 --> 02:10:42,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll get some emails about rejected.

1571
02:10:42,948 --> 02:10:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just get some emails that say, I am a banana.

1572
02:10:47,913 --> 02:10:48,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1573
02:10:48,214 --> 02:10:50,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally hats only.

1574
02:10:51,761 --> 02:11:01,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got the first bit of news about a new game coming out from one of the creators of Call of Duty, the founder.

1575
02:11:01,364 --> 02:11:14,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from, I guess, we don't really know the name of the game yet, but I love the company name Bullet Farm, which is led by David Vonderhaar.

1576
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:16,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody remind me to do that as the parody bump next week.

1577
02:11:16,789 --> 02:11:18,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullet Farming Simulator.

1578
02:11:18,989 --> 02:11:19,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullet Farm.

1579
02:11:19,729 --> 02:11:21,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1580
02:11:22,236 --> 02:11:26,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're working on a cooperative.

1581
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:37,067
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it was a first person shooter developed in the Unreal 5 engine that's going to emphasize intimate cooperative gameplay set in an original universe.

1582
02:11:37,067 --> 02:11:38,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That is vague.

1583
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:40,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm

1584
02:11:57,777 --> 02:11:59,919
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll add another, you know, add a caboose.

1585
02:11:59,919 --> 02:12:09,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you were talking about Bullet Farm, it made me think of, so I don't know if Jason's listening, but so there was there was a little boo-boo behind the scenes and these things happen.

1586
02:12:09,064 --> 02:12:10,165
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a big deal.

1587
02:12:10,165 --> 02:12:17,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But DarkSakura, when she was linking one of her things tonight, she actually used the link to a video on Twitter.

1588
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:19,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to do with the storms.

1589
02:12:19,051 --> 02:12:20,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was trucky.

1590
02:12:20,232 --> 02:12:21,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing salacious.

1591
02:12:21,312 --> 02:12:22,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a blizzard in Truckee.

1592
02:12:22,373 --> 02:12:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a snow plow plowing all the snow.

1593
02:12:25,675 --> 02:12:31,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jason sends me a text and it says, is the classic game of the week snowplow simulator?

1594
02:12:31,041 --> 02:12:44,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I realized that the tweet so and I started laughing and I was thinking like, actually, I'd play the fuck out of a snowplow simulator to be quite honest, because you can't see anything and you run into everything.

1595
02:12:44,315 --> 02:12:47,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Farming simulator, power wash simulator.

1596
02:12:48,139 --> 02:12:49,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Snowplow Simulator is a game

1597
02:13:14,873 --> 02:13:18,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no plowing simulator, but yes, it is a game.

1598
02:13:18,115 --> 02:13:20,796
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play it now.

1599
02:13:20,796 --> 02:13:21,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1600
02:13:21,396 --> 02:13:23,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play it later this year.

1601
02:13:23,357 --> 02:13:24,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming out this year.

1602
02:13:24,798 --> 02:13:25,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not out yet.

1603
02:13:25,638 --> 02:13:27,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1604
02:13:27,419 --> 02:13:36,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the Dekotora are... They take the live-in type of long-haul trucks.

1605
02:13:37,154 --> 02:13:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, they got lights on them and fun paint and all kinds of decoration.

1606
02:13:42,758 --> 02:13:46,460
[SPEAKER_06]: They get people together and like have meetings.

1607
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:52,084
[SPEAKER_06]: You did, Ranma, okay, send me the photos because I have a minor obsession with Dekotora.

1608
02:13:52,084 --> 02:13:54,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But, which is short for decorated truck.

1609
02:13:54,766 --> 02:13:56,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there you go.

1610
02:13:56,147 --> 02:13:56,387
[SPEAKER_06]: But,

1611
02:13:57,322 --> 02:14:14,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine if you had to, like, do a haul, but you had to make sure that, like, your truck was, like, hyper-decorated and you get more decorations as you go until you have the fanciest truck to ever grace Yokohama or something.

1612
02:14:14,749 --> 02:14:20,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Live here on Twitch television, I'm playing the preview for Snowplow Simulator.

1613
02:14:20,692 --> 02:14:25,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally looks like someone just fucking copied PowerWash and made it Snowplows, and I am here for that.

1614
02:14:27,796 --> 02:14:31,638
[SPEAKER_03]: What's great is- This is literally Power Wash Simulator with snow plows.

1615
02:14:31,638 --> 02:14:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about this is that there literally could be a scenario where someone has to go plow snow before they're allowed to simulate plowing snow on a computer game.

1616
02:14:44,185 --> 02:14:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't play your snow plowing game until you go plow the real thing.

1617
02:14:49,188 --> 02:14:51,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1618
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:51,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like

1619
02:14:54,147 --> 02:14:54,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1620
02:14:54,687 --> 02:15:01,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'd like to- Oh, I found- There's a picture here of a guy who has a chandelier in his truck.

1621
02:15:01,611 --> 02:15:08,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I just want to thank DarkSakura for her mistake because now I've learned that snow plowing simulator is the thing I need in my life.

1622
02:15:08,676 --> 02:15:13,458
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as mistakes, only happy little accidents.

1623
02:15:13,458 --> 02:15:14,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Bob Ross.

1624
02:15:16,266 --> 02:15:19,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1625
02:15:19,448 --> 02:15:21,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to this.

1626
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:28,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if Optimus Prime turned into a Dekotora, if that would be the Transformer version of Drag.

1627
02:15:28,994 --> 02:15:34,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's do this last story, which was what Jason had referenced in the intro tonight.

1628
02:15:34,077 --> 02:15:37,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little... Loki, take it away.

1629
02:15:37,019 --> 02:15:37,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to say.

1630
02:15:38,405 --> 02:15:47,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently there was a study done in Norway examining how video games influence children and their social behavior and their spending habits.

1631
02:15:47,830 --> 02:15:56,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, younger players are being bullied over the lack of their cosmetic skins or are using in-game items to be more popular.

1632
02:15:56,874 --> 02:15:57,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.

1633
02:16:08,273 --> 02:16:13,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Children may experience being called poor if they haven't spent money on their character.

1634
02:16:13,238 --> 02:16:22,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Children who have spent money on their in-game character can gain increased attention and other advantages, thus buying popularity.

1635
02:16:24,230 --> 02:16:24,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamecompanies

1636
02:16:41,849 --> 02:16:42,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that type of thing.

1637
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just because it's free to play games.

1638
02:16:45,311 --> 02:16:49,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like you said, Loki, it's this is what the companies want and so forth.

1639
02:16:49,854 --> 02:16:51,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why it's making headlines.

1640
02:16:51,535 --> 02:16:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, DarkTetsuya is really right.

1641
02:16:53,977 --> 02:16:55,658
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll find any reason to pick on other kids.

1642
02:16:55,658 --> 02:16:56,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoes with Velcro were cool.

1643
02:16:56,518 --> 02:16:57,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Evil, for the record.

1644
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:57,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1645
02:16:57,839 --> 02:16:59,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Either of y'all, why would you wear shoes with Velcro?

1646
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:01,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're fucking comfortable.

1647
02:17:01,481 --> 02:17:01,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why?

1648
02:17:01,821 --> 02:17:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you wearing pumps?

1649
02:17:02,762 --> 02:17:05,404
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite Aldos are the ones without laces.

1650
02:17:05,404 --> 02:17:08,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not apologizing.

1651
02:17:08,245 --> 02:17:10,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, but it was cool when and like in the like

1652
02:17:11,485 --> 02:17:15,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say mid-ish 80s when I was in elementary school.

1653
02:17:15,389 --> 02:17:18,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Or sorry, late elementary school, like going into middle school.

1654
02:17:19,292 --> 02:17:31,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the thing was laceless keds where you just sewed them close or you sat on the heel of your keds and turned them into mules with no laces.

1655
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:32,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I remember.

1656
02:17:32,541 --> 02:17:39,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So right about the same time, DarkSakura, when I was in junior high school, I remember what the must have thing was with shoes, the pump shoes.

1657
02:17:39,365 --> 02:17:43,468
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember the little pumping shoes that I was in high school by then?

1658
02:17:43,468 --> 02:17:43,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you?

1659
02:17:44,028 --> 02:17:44,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1660
02:17:54,386 --> 02:17:56,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, no.

1661
02:17:56,126 --> 02:18:05,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing, too, is like if your parents screwed up and bought you the wrong kind of jeans, then you had to to peg your jeans.

1662
02:18:05,089 --> 02:18:05,609
[SPEAKER_03]: My gosh.

1663
02:18:05,609 --> 02:18:06,689
[SPEAKER_06]: In the 80s.

1664
02:18:06,689 --> 02:18:08,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So silly.

1665
02:18:08,390 --> 02:18:15,852
[SPEAKER_03]: SGO100 Matt says the missus is a school teacher and she's had kids fight over being made fun of for having basic Fortnite skins.

1666
02:18:15,852 --> 02:18:16,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Those kids are 10.

1667
02:18:16,912 --> 02:18:18,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's a thing.

1668
02:18:18,593 --> 02:18:19,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Silly, silly, silly.

1669
02:18:21,061 --> 02:18:28,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens in Dead by Daylight, though, where you make judgments on whoever's in your lobby based on if they've got default cosmetics or not.

1670
02:18:28,307 --> 02:18:40,277
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like we either have someone who's trying to dupe someone, an actual noob, or someone who got banned from their account and they're going to play like an asshole.

1671
02:18:40,277 --> 02:18:42,799
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture in chat says, Early 90s?

1672
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:44,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, I was out of high school.

1673
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, I'm old.

1674
02:18:46,542 --> 02:18:47,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you are.

1675
02:18:47,923 --> 02:18:48,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know you were older than me.

1676
02:18:50,578 --> 02:18:52,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I graduated in 94.

1677
02:18:52,339 --> 02:18:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: What else am I supposed to reply to that podculture?

1678
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:05,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it makes you feel better, I meet people that are like, like, especially through the horror hosting and stuff that I do on the side, I meet people that are like, Yeah, I was born in 1998.

1679
02:19:05,743 --> 02:19:10,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like after I graduated high school, and I'm always like, I'm gonna pass away.

1680
02:19:10,484 --> 02:19:13,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1681
02:19:13,225 --> 02:19:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yes, class of 96.

1682
02:19:17,502 --> 02:19:26,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, my thing is like, especially with what I do when I'm on the phone and I get people who are my age saying, well, you could probably be my kid and blah, blah.

1683
02:19:26,808 --> 02:19:28,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm your age.

1684
02:19:28,088 --> 02:19:29,589
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1685
02:19:29,589 --> 02:19:34,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I just have a young voice and spite keeps me young too.

1686
02:19:34,372 --> 02:19:42,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says my favorite is when kids ask, what was life like in the late 1900s?

1687
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:46,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch.tv VOG Network

1690
02:20:11,599 --> 02:20:13,519
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have OLR.

1691
02:20:13,519 --> 02:20:15,800

[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at orangelandradio.com.

1693
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:18,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's old school.

1694
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:20,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what life was like in the early 1900s.

1695
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:21,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You sent emails.

1696
02:20:21,501 --> 02:20:22,061
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1697
02:20:22,061 --> 02:20:22,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Or late 1900s.

1698
02:20:22,901 --> 02:20:23,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1699
02:20:23,341 --> 02:20:24,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what I'm talking about.

1700
02:20:24,241 --> 02:20:24,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Postcards.

1701
02:20:24,921 --> 02:20:26,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1702
02:20:26,242 --> 02:20:27,222
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pony Express.

1703
02:20:27,222 --> 02:20:27,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1704
02:20:27,882 --> 02:20:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1705
02:20:29,503 --> 02:20:30,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say this.

1706
02:20:30,823 --> 02:20:34,865
[SPEAKER_06]: People are getting back into sending actual letters and it's fucking beautiful.

1707
02:20:34,865 --> 02:20:37,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been actually writing people letters.

1708
02:20:37,226 --> 02:20:37,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1709
02:20:37,866 --> 02:20:38,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Evil's right.

1710
02:20:38,367 --> 02:20:42,528
[SPEAKER_06]: You pass notes, but you had to fold them a certain way or you failed the note passing.

1711
02:20:42,528 --> 02:20:46,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't kids today using rotary phones, too?

1712
02:20:46,230 --> 02:20:48,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of like old school, I heard that was a thing.

1713
02:20:48,111 --> 02:20:49,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Like models of them.

1714
02:20:49,712 --> 02:20:54,434
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, I kind of miss a rotary phone because you could like kill a person with one.

1715
02:20:56,465 --> 02:21:03,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if someone broke into your house, you just grab the rotary phone and smack them.

1716
02:21:03,309 --> 02:21:03,989
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1717
02:21:03,989 --> 02:21:05,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm serious.

1718
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:06,671
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's so true.

1719
02:21:06,671 --> 02:21:12,314
[SPEAKER_03]: If only, you know, Drew Barrymore had had that in the opening shots of Scream, maybe that would have been a much different movie.

1720
02:21:12,314 --> 02:21:17,336
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Snowflower Simulator has a free prologue.

1721
02:21:17,336 --> 02:21:20,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, might be worth checking out.

1722
02:21:20,258 --> 02:21:21,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I'll be streaming this week.

1723
02:21:23,113 --> 02:21:27,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's right, people asking for vinyl records.

1724
02:21:27,758 --> 02:21:37,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say something, when you have a brand new vinyl record, there is something to hearing it in analog versus digital that it's completely different.

1725
02:21:37,489 --> 02:21:42,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that there's another boom for transistor tubes, people looking for old hi-fis.

1726
02:21:43,072 --> 02:21:48,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Mishkins in chat says, I just I miss just slamming the receiver down when you get mad for me.

1727
02:21:48,938 --> 02:21:51,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can hardly throw your phone across the room.

1728
02:21:51,161 --> 02:21:57,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the portable phone like the early portable phones and it was a button called flash would let you because that's how you like you switch to the call waiting.

1729
02:21:57,928 --> 02:21:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone remember call waiting?

1730
02:21:59,770 --> 02:22:01,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And flash is how you switch.

1731
02:22:01,372 --> 02:22:03,995
[SPEAKER_03]: It could also accidentally hang up on your friends accidentally.

1732
02:22:05,842 --> 02:22:27,291
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you didn't have call waiting if you tap that flash button to other people it sounded like the sound when someone has a call waiting like that kind of crackle because you can hear a crackle but not the beep that the receiver got and you could just be oh excuse me hit the mute button on your on your phone when you're on like and then just like listen to the other person completely lose their shit

1733
02:22:28,728 --> 02:22:34,870
[SPEAKER_03]: SSG100 Matt says gotta have the long phone cord that stretches past the kitchen to the bathroom or your bedroom.

1734
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:39,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and then you shut the door with the cord hanging through.

1735
02:22:39,031 --> 02:22:45,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I remember our first cordless phone had a gigantic fucking antenna on it.

1736
02:22:45,213 --> 02:22:47,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was cordless.

1737
02:22:47,794 --> 02:22:52,916
[SPEAKER_06]: My phone, I had a swatch phone that was like the kind of the clear one.

1738
02:22:54,292 --> 02:23:04,942
[SPEAKER_06]: and I had a cable that could go from my upstairs bedroom down the stairs into the living room if I wanted to.

1739
02:23:04,942 --> 02:23:08,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Those see-through phones are like the quintessential fuckin' 90s phone.

1740
02:23:10,876 --> 02:23:12,377
[SPEAKER_06]: and a Welsh Watch.

1741
02:23:12,377 --> 02:23:12,738
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1742
02:23:12,738 --> 02:23:13,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guess what?

1743
02:23:13,358 --> 02:23:20,464
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a caller on our Discord, which you should join, vognetwork.com.

1744
02:23:20,464 --> 02:23:23,466
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to join our Discord server and talk to us throughout the week.

1745
02:23:23,466 --> 02:23:27,269
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually quite a few stories tonight I pulled from our channel and Discord.

1746
02:23:27,269 --> 02:23:30,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you to all the participants who chat throughout the week.

1747
02:23:30,252 --> 02:23:33,154
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have a call and somebody wants to come on air with us tonight.

1748
02:23:33,154 --> 02:23:34,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say hello.

1749
02:23:34,796 --> 02:23:36,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio.

1750
02:23:36,097 --> 02:23:37,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1751
02:23:37,338 --> 02:23:38,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the one and only

1752
02:23:41,375 --> 02:23:43,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... Hi.

1753
02:23:43,837 --> 02:23:45,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a short call.

1754
02:23:45,638 --> 02:23:46,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, what'd you do?

1755
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:48,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do shit!

1756
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:58,168
[SPEAKER_03]: He moved his- Hi, it's the one and only, and instead of turning on his webcam, he fucking sent himself back to the green room.

1757
02:23:58,168 --> 02:23:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilliant.

1758
02:23:59,409 --> 02:24:02,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mean to say the one and only fucking Houdini, cause you disappear?

1759
02:24:05,066 --> 02:24:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it again!

1760
02:24:05,887 --> 02:24:07,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it!

1761
02:24:07,228 --> 02:24:08,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, stop it!

1762
02:24:08,249 --> 02:24:09,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it working now?

1763
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:09,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it!

1764
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:10,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it working?

1765
02:24:10,351 --> 02:24:11,091
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear you!

1766
02:24:11,091 --> 02:24:12,232
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear you, we just don't see you.

1767
02:24:12,232 --> 02:24:12,893
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

1768
02:24:12,893 --> 02:24:13,954
[SPEAKER_03]: There you are.

1769
02:24:13,954 --> 02:24:14,755
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

1770
02:24:14,755 --> 02:24:16,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright.

1771
02:24:16,156 --> 02:24:19,759
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I have a convention coming up, and I don't need this stress.

1772
02:24:19,759 --> 02:24:25,324
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I'm gonna have to pull Daitenshi down and do a clean format before things kick off.

1773
02:24:25,324 --> 02:24:25,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

1774
02:24:25,785 --> 02:24:27,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Podculture said Ranma hit the flash button.

1775
02:24:29,179 --> 02:24:30,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, quick, quick.

1776
02:24:30,359 --> 02:24:40,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, Ranma, Ranma, before you get to whatever it is you really want to talk about tonight, what was the phone you had when you were in junior high?

1777
02:24:40,603 --> 02:24:52,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an AT&T rotary phone because my great grandmother, Lord rest her soul, refused to get us push button phones because she didn't want to pay extra money for the phones.

1778
02:24:52,867 --> 02:24:56,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at that time, you couldn't buy phones in retail stores.

1779
02:24:58,004 --> 02:25:10,507
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably could, but if you were with AT&T, you had to go to the AT&T store where they would show up the latest model desk phones for you to buy or pay monthly on as part of your phone bill.

1780
02:25:10,507 --> 02:25:15,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things never fucking change, because they sure figured out how to keep that going, didn't they?

1781
02:25:15,589 --> 02:25:22,931
[SPEAKER_06]: We had BellSouth, who AT&T acquired, but you could go to RadioShack and buy a phone.

1782
02:25:23,766 --> 02:25:25,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

1783
02:25:25,107 --> 02:25:26,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, all right.

1784
02:25:26,407 --> 02:25:26,928
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1785
02:25:26,928 --> 02:25:27,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Back on topic.

1786
02:25:27,828 --> 02:25:30,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, what did you call us about tonight?

1787
02:25:30,549 --> 02:25:32,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to Rob, I want to thank you.

1788
02:25:32,951 --> 02:25:36,052
[SPEAKER_00]: You unlocked a core memory.

1789
02:25:36,052 --> 02:25:37,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that.

1790
02:25:37,053 --> 02:25:37,533
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1791
02:25:37,533 --> 02:25:39,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me more.

1792
02:25:39,254 --> 02:25:41,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say one thing, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.

1793
02:25:41,935 --> 02:25:44,977
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bleeding.

1794
02:25:48,605 --> 02:25:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I think your noise gate is preventing all that from coming through, but I believe the quote was, my anus is bleeding.

1795
02:25:53,891 --> 02:25:55,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, from the receptionist.

1796
02:25:55,393 --> 02:25:56,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1797
02:25:56,334 --> 02:25:59,017
[SPEAKER_07]: The love of God and all that is holy.

1798
02:26:00,538 --> 02:26:02,919
[SPEAKER_03]: My anus is bleeding.

1799
02:26:02,919 --> 02:26:08,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you need that sound effect on your board, the little Xbox achievement unlocked noise.

1800
02:26:08,323 --> 02:26:10,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Core memory unlocked.

1801
02:26:10,764 --> 02:26:13,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna find I'm gonna find that.

1802
02:26:13,085 --> 02:26:13,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Rob.

1803
02:26:13,886 --> 02:26:15,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the thing.

1804
02:26:15,087 --> 02:26:18,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in I would say the late 90s, early 2000s.

1805
02:26:18,369 --> 02:26:20,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Good God, I'm dating myself.

1806
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:22,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to conventions.

1807
02:26:22,451 --> 02:26:24,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cars will have what's called

1808
02:26:25,097 --> 02:26:27,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Anime Hell Night or Hell Anime or whatever.

1809
02:26:27,341 --> 02:26:28,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I know about this.

1810
02:26:28,804 --> 02:26:30,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.

1811
02:26:30,247 --> 02:26:32,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those who don't know...

1812
02:26:33,433 --> 02:26:37,234
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts around 10, 11 o'clock after the masquerade.

1813
02:26:37,234 --> 02:26:40,936
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time, you're probably stoned, liquored up, or whatever.

1814
02:26:40,936 --> 02:26:48,579
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into main events, and they would just play a bunch of really bad dubs, bad videos, and all this stuff.

1815
02:26:48,579 --> 02:26:54,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And a part of this, every year, was rejected by Don Hirschfeld.

1816
02:26:54,681 --> 02:27:02,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved it so much, and I remember years back, somebody found the YouTube link, and I was like, save.

1817
02:27:04,653 --> 02:27:06,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he did a lot of other cartoons, too.

1818
02:27:06,254 --> 02:27:08,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what he does now.

1819
02:27:08,574 --> 02:27:11,295
[SPEAKER_03]: One of his one of his cartoons was nominated for an Oscar.

1820
02:27:11,295 --> 02:27:13,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was the last time I kind of heard from that guy.

1821
02:27:13,076 --> 02:27:14,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was one.

1822
02:27:14,797 --> 02:27:17,878
[SPEAKER_03]: It was later, but it was like something was the meaning of life.

1823
02:27:17,878 --> 02:27:18,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1824
02:27:18,598 --> 02:27:25,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go look up his wiki or something like that, which one of the listeners in chat is probably doing now.

1825
02:27:25,140 --> 02:27:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always one person, but I'm glad I could unlock the core memory for you.

1826
02:27:33,223 --> 02:27:37,026
[SPEAKER_06]: There was- At Anime Expo, they would do AMV Hell.

1827
02:27:37,026 --> 02:27:41,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, some conventions still do that, and yes, they still make AMV Hell.

1828
02:27:41,188 --> 02:27:57,680
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I would do in my room when people would come to hang out, I'd have the alcohol and the mixers ready, my laptop hooked up to the big- to the widescreen, and I would just play AMV Hell, and we would just lose our minds over it, because of how- because how funny and how chaotic they were.

1829
02:27:58,610 --> 02:28:05,351
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2016, World of Tomorrow was his film that was nominated for Best Short Film at the 88th Academy Awards, but he did not win.

1830
02:28:05,351 --> 02:28:11,272
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost to another, Bear Story was the name of the film that won that year.

1831
02:28:26,530 --> 02:28:32,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not that long ago, 2016.

1832
02:28:32,394 --> 02:28:38,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they say his visual influence influenced the Pixar film Soul.

1833
02:28:38,017 --> 02:28:41,039
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that watched that during the, because that came out during the pandemic.

1834
02:28:41,039 --> 02:28:43,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a Disney Plus thing, so.

1835
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:44,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

1836
02:28:44,521 --> 02:28:45,702
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on my list.

1837
02:28:45,702 --> 02:28:47,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And good God, my list is just big.

1838
02:28:47,763 --> 02:28:52,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my list is delayed because I finally got my PlayStation 5 and Rebirth is just sitting there.

1839
02:28:53,775 --> 02:29:00,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, mine's still in the shrink wrap waiting to open and play because I've been out of town.

1840
02:29:00,863 --> 02:29:02,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I already cracked it open.

1841
02:29:02,184 --> 02:29:09,513
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only one end of Evangelion for me, and it's Redeath.

1842
02:29:09,513 --> 02:29:10,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

1843
02:29:10,374 --> 02:29:11,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to play Rebirth.

1844
02:29:11,815 --> 02:29:13,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Stingy, guess what?

1845
02:29:13,877 --> 02:29:15,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great make out spot.

1846
02:29:16,673 --> 02:29:23,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to play Rebirth, but I feel like it's one of those things that more people will watch if I stream it if I don't do it right now.

1847
02:29:23,317 --> 02:29:28,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if I wait for other people to beat it first and then stream it, people will be less nervous about spoilers.

1848
02:29:47,054 --> 02:29:48,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Saucer Date Night

1849
02:29:56,767 --> 02:29:58,068
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them, and it made me happy.

1850
02:30:17,423 --> 02:30:20,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Final Fantasy VII Remake isn't a remake.

1851
02:30:20,484 --> 02:30:21,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not a remake.

1852
02:30:21,804 --> 02:30:28,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a it's a actually, I can't believe I can't believe I'm going to credit Bobby twice in the universe.

1853
02:30:28,945 --> 02:30:39,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe I'm going to credit Bobby twice tonight on this show, but I'm going to I thought his comparison to saying it is like the newer Star Trek movies was very, very on point.

1854
02:30:39,207 --> 02:30:43,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like a story, you know, but yet it's somehow very different.

1855
02:30:43,988 --> 02:30:46,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was a very good comparison what he said on his show tonight.

1856
02:30:46,669 --> 02:30:47,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess.

1857
02:30:47,790 --> 02:30:50,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like the new Scott Pilgrim series on Netflix.

1858
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:51,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that too.

1859
02:30:51,892 --> 02:30:53,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Very that.

1860
02:30:53,032 --> 02:30:54,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, that was so good.

1861
02:30:54,673 --> 02:30:55,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

1862
02:30:55,553 --> 02:30:58,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But but Jamie, not that different.

1863
02:30:58,654 --> 02:31:00,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink.

1864
02:31:00,655 --> 02:31:01,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink.

1865
02:31:01,056 --> 02:31:03,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It really isn't that different.

1866
02:31:03,277 --> 02:31:11,980
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Scott Pilgrim was good, but I kind of want like a 90 minute movie to wrap up what they were planning at the end, even though they said it ain't going to happen.

1867
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,141
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been nice.

1868
02:31:13,141 --> 02:31:13,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1869
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:23,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this about Remake and then I'll get up on out of here because I was discussing this with a friend of mine and she makes a valid point.

1870
02:31:23,573 --> 02:31:27,776
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that the whispers that you see towards the end of the game

1871
02:31:28,792 --> 02:31:30,854
[SPEAKER_00]: represents the angry fandom as a whole.

1872
02:31:47,427 --> 02:32:06,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So the what they do at the end there where the whispers reset a literal somebody dies that's not supposed to when that happened I fucking screamed by the way I was like what I was I thought they would do something different I didn't think they'd fucking do that but then the whispers reset it all that whole thing and it was like

1873
02:32:07,687 --> 02:32:09,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, it's so on point.

1874
02:32:09,769 --> 02:32:11,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Alan saw that scene.

1875
02:32:11,210 --> 02:32:13,031
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, oh, are the Whispers the angry fans?

1876
02:32:13,031 --> 02:32:15,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Saying, no, the game has to be exact.

1877
02:32:15,172 --> 02:32:18,614
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't fucking end the game at Midgar.

1878
02:32:18,614 --> 02:32:23,958
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to... Disc 1 should end where Disc 1 ended in the... It's like, it's so on point.

1879
02:32:23,958 --> 02:32:24,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so on point.

1880
02:32:24,959 --> 02:32:29,862
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very... Then you find out another character ain't dead yet, so...

1881
02:32:34,458 --> 02:32:46,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I would encourage you all to play it if you haven't, because even with what I just said, there's something to be said for it's about the journey, not the destination, that there's a lot of gaps to fill in.

1882
02:32:46,646 --> 02:32:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is about fate and destiny, and the characters in the game want to go against fate and destiny.

1883
02:32:55,111 --> 02:32:58,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Fate and Destiny in the remake series is the 1997 story.

1884
02:32:58,653 --> 02:33:00,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very, very that.

1885
02:33:00,334 --> 02:33:06,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why that's why I'm really excited to play this, because it's very clear now.

1886
02:33:06,058 --> 02:33:19,167
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think you know what's happening in this game, you don't, because you didn't play the first game to to know that they they they done told you by the end of that game, we're going to do whatever the fuck we want.

1887
02:33:19,167 --> 02:33:23,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know the entire FF7 lore inside and out.

1888
02:33:24,881 --> 02:33:31,745
[SPEAKER_00]: When I jumped into Remake, I was like, I cannot wait to see the changes that they made.

1889
02:33:31,745 --> 02:33:34,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoyed every single bit.

1890
02:33:34,988 --> 02:33:40,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of those, I don't care about spoilers because I will still watch it or play it regardless.

1891
02:33:40,951 --> 02:33:42,953
[SPEAKER_00]: This game is an exception to that.

1892
02:33:42,953 --> 02:33:44,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't want to know nothing.

1893
02:33:44,994 --> 02:33:47,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go in and I want to enjoy this.

1894
02:33:47,496 --> 02:33:50,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I end up screaming like a bitch because of some great shit that happened,

1895
02:33:53,677 --> 02:33:54,518
[SPEAKER_03]: JNX Lounge Radio

1896
02:34:23,957 --> 02:34:26,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I will listen on the podcast feed on my way to work.

1897
02:34:26,818 --> 02:34:30,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, that was the underline from episode one.

1898
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:33,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all is woke and Rob is fabulous.

1899
02:34:33,142 --> 02:34:39,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like that, go take a walk and go do something and touch grass.

1900
02:34:39,525 --> 02:34:40,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1901
02:34:40,605 --> 02:34:43,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Except touch grass wasn't a saying in 2002, but that's all right.

1902
02:34:43,606 --> 02:34:44,127
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1903
02:34:45,007 --> 02:34:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think you came out on the show yet by that point.

1904
02:34:47,269 --> 02:34:49,631
[SPEAKER_03]: No, do you remember in the early episodes?

1905
02:34:49,631 --> 02:34:51,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You came out on the show.

1906
02:34:51,353 --> 02:34:51,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

1907
02:34:51,813 --> 02:34:52,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1908
02:34:52,294 --> 02:34:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

1909
02:34:53,075 --> 02:34:55,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, I just wasn't out.

1910
02:34:55,297 --> 02:34:56,998
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of, yeah.

1911
02:34:56,998 --> 02:34:59,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, there were some of us who knew and were still happy regardless.

1912
02:34:59,961 --> 02:35:01,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was out IRL.

1913
02:35:01,722 --> 02:35:07,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a choice to not be out on the radio at first, but that's because some people on the internet are assholes.

1914
02:35:07,728 --> 02:35:11,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki was staying in and even sang about it.

1915
02:35:12,230 --> 02:35:13,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an all-time high.

1916
02:35:13,050 --> 02:35:14,210
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it.

1917
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:15,411
[SPEAKER_03]: We're wrapping up.

1918
02:35:15,411 --> 02:35:16,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many memories.

1919
02:35:16,031 --> 02:35:17,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done with y'all.

1920
02:35:17,471 --> 02:35:18,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take y'all anymore.

1921
02:35:18,691 --> 02:35:19,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many core memories.

1922
02:35:19,551 --> 02:35:21,192
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anime jam session.

1923
02:35:21,192 --> 02:35:22,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to it.

1924
02:35:22,192 --> 02:35:29,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you'll hear about anime hell when Grandpa gets on his chair and tells stories.

1925
02:35:29,333 --> 02:35:33,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, but there is talk about a con that may have scammed some people that happened over the weekend.

1926
02:35:33,814 --> 02:35:35,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune in to find out more.

1927
02:35:35,274 --> 02:35:36,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Again?

1928
02:35:36,194 --> 02:35:36,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't worry.

1929
02:35:36,694 --> 02:35:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll give everybody 30 minutes in the ball pit.

1930
02:35:39,735 --> 02:35:40,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.

1931
02:35:40,819 --> 02:35:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1932
02:35:41,579 --> 02:35:42,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye Rama.

1933
02:35:42,819 --> 02:35:44,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1934
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:46,240
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1935
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:48,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, with that, I think we're gonna wrap it up.

1936
02:35:48,441 --> 02:35:49,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, let me check in with Loki real quick.

1937
02:35:49,781 --> 02:35:51,361
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any last minute stories.

1938
02:35:51,361 --> 02:35:53,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have missed a headline, but I don't think I did.

1939
02:35:53,021 --> 02:35:54,122
[SPEAKER_03]: There is not.

1940
02:35:54,122 --> 02:35:54,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured.

1941
02:35:54,862 --> 02:35:55,102
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1942
02:35:55,102 --> 02:35:55,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fine.

1943
02:35:55,582 --> 02:35:57,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're, we're coming up on two and a half hours.

1944
02:35:57,542 --> 02:35:59,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're good to wrap up.

1945
02:35:59,183 --> 02:36:01,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to of course, thank everybody for listening tonight.

1946
02:36:01,763 --> 02:36:05,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being back this week, even though we were gone last week very randomly.

1947
02:36:06,044 --> 02:36:09,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, I appreciate a vacation in spite of everything we talked about tonight.

1948
02:36:09,826 --> 02:36:11,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great time.

1949
02:36:11,006 --> 02:36:12,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going again next year.

1950
02:36:12,507 --> 02:36:15,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope y'all are ready for it.

1951
02:36:15,128 --> 02:36:16,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's it.

1952
02:36:16,889 --> 02:36:18,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for listening to the show.

1953
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:21,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in seven days to talk about whatever happens this week.

1954
02:36:21,691 --> 02:36:22,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy your gaming this week.

1955
02:36:22,712 --> 02:36:30,375
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1956
02:36:30,375 --> 02:36:32,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, tell a friend.

1957
02:36:32,396 --> 02:36:33,197
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura streaming tonight!

1958
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:51,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a little bit short because I have work tomorrow.

1959
02:36:51,901 --> 02:36:54,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually starting training that I don't need.

1960
02:36:54,563 --> 02:36:57,364
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's killer night on Debbie Delight.

1961
02:36:57,364 --> 02:36:59,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to happen.

1962
02:36:59,265 --> 02:37:00,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Please be there.

1963
02:37:00,245 --> 02:37:01,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Please stay.

1964
02:37:01,286 --> 02:37:02,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I could use some company.

1965
02:37:02,346 --> 02:37:04,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a little down.

1966
02:37:04,087 --> 02:37:05,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd appreciate it.

1967
02:37:05,548 --> 02:37:07,668
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you don't have to.

1968
02:37:07,668 --> 02:37:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Just it would be appreciated.

1969
02:37:09,129 --> 02:37:09,509
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1970
02:37:09,509 --> 02:37:11,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, well, and what I would like to end with.

1971
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:13,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1972
02:37:13,811 --> 02:37:15,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody a little bit gay.

1973
02:37:18,362 --> 02:37:21,023
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, DarkSakura.

1974
02:37:21,023 --> 02:37:22,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1975
02:37:22,964 --> 02:37:24,204
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll go over to you, Loki.

1976
02:37:24,204 --> 02:37:26,205
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your final thought tonight?

1977
02:37:26,205 --> 02:37:32,328
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is that I will be well I I was getting it ready.

1978
02:37:32,328 --> 02:37:39,691
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of already ready to go but I still want to add a few more things to it but I'll be dropping merch drop merch this week.

1979
02:37:41,144 --> 02:37:44,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited to see what quotable things you have.

1980
02:37:44,329 --> 02:37:46,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's right now.

1981
02:37:46,131 --> 02:37:49,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the robot master stuff from season two of channel 64.

1982
02:37:49,956 --> 02:37:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we'll see about adding some other non things in there.

1983
02:37:55,684 --> 02:37:57,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to do a pixel poop shirt.

1984
02:37:57,727 --> 02:37:58,148
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.

1985
02:37:58,984 --> 02:38:00,645
[SPEAKER_03]: you should do a pixel blue shirt.

1986
02:38:00,645 --> 02:38:02,705
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you have all the sprites.

1987
02:38:02,705 --> 02:38:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I just get permission from Aaron and be the nice thing to do but I think he could be okay with it.

1988
02:38:07,487 --> 02:38:07,767
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1989
02:38:07,767 --> 02:38:10,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's gonna do it.

1990
02:38:10,308 --> 02:38:24,873
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought I don't know I have a lot of video games to catch up on and most of it is just playing things that have fucking seasonal content and stuff I need to catch up on like Diablo four and no man's sky I needed to get that expedition done that's on my list as well and then I'll get to fall fancy seven rebirth.

1991
02:38:25,393 --> 02:38:27,755
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is going to do it for Orange Lingerie tonight.

1992
02:38:27,755 --> 02:38:32,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so much for being here and staying up with us tonight and listening to us in the podcast feed.

1993
02:38:32,239 --> 02:38:33,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, joining us after a break.

1994
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:34,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

1995
02:38:34,881 --> 02:38:37,544
[SPEAKER_03]: The road to 1000 episodes continues, if you can believe it.

1996
02:38:37,544 --> 02:38:40,506
[SPEAKER_03]: We're six weeks away at this point from 1000 episodes.

1997
02:38:40,506 --> 02:38:42,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that is something no

1998
02:38:42,848 --> 02:38:45,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Weekly Gaming Podcast has ever done.

1999
02:38:45,610 --> 02:38:46,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Emphasis on weekly.

2000
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:50,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's at least at least one other show that is more than just weekly that has done it.

2001
02:38:50,433 --> 02:38:52,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as a weekly show goes, we'll be the first.

2002
02:38:52,895 --> 02:38:54,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really exciting.

2003
02:38:54,456 --> 02:38:56,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all for being here and being a part of it.

2004

[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you go all the way back to episode one that DJ Ranma S was quoting earlier, or others, really appreciate all of your support.

2005
02:39:03,602 --> 02:39:09,906
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just joined us at episode 993 last week, or even tonight, it means just as much to us as all the rest of it.

2006
02:39:09,906 --> 02:39:11,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being here and being a part of it.

2007
02:39:11,547 --> 02:39:12,348
