1
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:14,656
[SPEAKER_03]: According to their studio founder, Larian Studios is done with Baldur's Gate, the entire series.

2
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:17,958
[SPEAKER_03]: No Baldur's Gate 4, no Baldur's Gate 3 expansions, fully done.

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: What might happen in 10 years?

4
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:24,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Sven has a change of heart, private equity buys Larian Studios and revives it under someone else's direction?

5
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:27,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a spiritual successor made from an ex-studio employee?

6
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,246
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the time as a flat circle intro.

7
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:34,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somerson, Loki, to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:41,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:47,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:58,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio back live once again with episode number 997 of our show for tonight, March 24th, 2024.

12
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,070
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here with you every week, joined by my co-hosts over there in that corner.

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings and salivations.

16
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:17,541
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing this fine Sunday evening?

17
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleepier.

18
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just like, I didn't sleep enough.

19
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:23,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing video games.

20
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been kind of a busy time.

21
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,789
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I remember when that was the thing.

22
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,230
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the line I used when I was 18.

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're how old now, Miss Sakura?

24
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Your business.

25
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:41,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And my birthday is not even yet.

26
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:42,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

27
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:43,907
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming up, though.

28
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:44,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up, though.

29
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:49,789
[SPEAKER_05]: The week after we hit 1000 episodes, believe it or not.

30
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:52,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be hopefully quite the gathering.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love for all of my friends to come celebrate with me.

32
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,032
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

33
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's.

34
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:58,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's online.

35
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You can all come play with me.

36
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:07,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I'll, I'll be there, but after work, cause unfortunately, uh, I can't use that as an excuse to get out of work, but we'll see.

37
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:08,908
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

38
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but also- I don't know, my birthday is a holiday.

39
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,049
[SPEAKER_02]: You should just be like, it's DarkSakura's birthday.

40
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the day off.

41
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:17,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a holiday in my religion.

42
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if my, my, uh, my boss observes that, but we'll see.

44
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:22,851
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

45
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, uh, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

46
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Loki.

47
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

48
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,252
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

49
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:29,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing okay.

50
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:30,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, is your birthday gonna be a holiday too?

52
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:37,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it always is.

53
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:37,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

54
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:38,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Memorial.

55
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:44,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I just realized like after those words left my mouth, I was like, actually, that might be a really bad joke.

56
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,402
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, they don't.

57
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:46,583
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't make it a holiday.

58
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it's just a memorial.

59
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone gets depressed on your birthday.

60
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone gets depressed on your birthday.

61
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:53,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

62
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:58,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So well, hopefully that can bring you a little bit of joy in six months.

63
00:02:58,592 --> 00:02:59,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You still got some time, though.

64
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:00,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You still got a little bit of time.

65
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

66
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,476
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

67
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:07,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the game playing behind you tonight.

68
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like Wave Race on?

70
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,403
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it can't be Wave Race because it looks like PS2.

71
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:13,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Wave Race.

72
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

73
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,065
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

74
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:16,346
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what that is.

75
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jet Moto or something.

76
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Wave Race.

77
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like Jet Moto.

78
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:23,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Jet Moto 2, actually.

79
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:23,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Aha!

80
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:26,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really played those games to be honest.

81
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not step to my knowledge, Rob.

82
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

83
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played this game in my life.

84
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:36,380
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed to bring it back because it was a really fun racing series.

85
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like flying jet skis, basically.

86
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:40,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocket jet skis.

87
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:42,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's jet skis that don't really go on water.

88
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,265
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on land.

89
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:44,965
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make any sense.

90
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:45,906
[SPEAKER_04]: They do sometimes.

91
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:49,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they can go on water, but they can also hover on land.

92
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:53,271
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the duck boat in Seattle.

93
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:53,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

94
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:59,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some of the gaming news for the week.

95
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:06,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we're gonna start off with this is something that's kind of been going around the entire industry this week.

96
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I don't know if you want to do this or you want me to do it.

97
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:10,453
[SPEAKER_05]: This story.

98
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not very familiar with this, but sure.

99
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:13,435
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can.

100
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:14,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I can read it.

101
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:14,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

102
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:24,571
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kotaku editor-in-chief has exited the company due to the parent company's new guide directive.

103
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:29,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jen Glennon has resigned after five months in her role.

104
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:35,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently this is due to a new editorial direction from GeoMedia.

105
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what that direction is.

106
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it says, I firmly believe that the decision to invert Kotaku's editorial strategy to deprioritize news in favor of guides is fundamentally misguided given its current infrastructure of the site.

107
00:04:56,085 --> 00:05:07,913
[SPEAKER_04]: This decision is directly contradicted by months of traffic data and shows an astonishing disregard for the livelihoods of the remaining writers and editors who work for Kotaku.

108
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:10,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, they'll just get AI to do it.

109
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:11,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

110
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:18,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, but it's going to be a little hard for AI to write guides for games that just came out because there's nothing for the AI to steal for.

111
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, learn from.

112
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:20,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

113
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:25,889
[SPEAKER_04]: There's stuff that for them to steal from, like all the other guides out there, they'll just rip from them.

114
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,191
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's annoying.

115
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So you mean guides for older games where the content does exist, not guides for newer games?

116
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,546
[SPEAKER_04]: or Listicles and that kind of nonsense.

117
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,526
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they do this all the time.

118
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it's, hey, hey.

119
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,768
[SPEAKER_01]: How well does this work for others?

120
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:49,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they feel it's a success, the new, the parent company.

121
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they're probably looking to drive engagement to these articles, Evergreen or something like that.

122
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.

123
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't go to Kotaku for guides.

124
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,054
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

125
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:03,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So strike one right there, I guess.

126
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:03,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't,

127
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,563
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an industry wide issue.

128
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,982
[SPEAKER_05]: This is weird because, you know, when you look at it for what face value is, do guides get a lot of hits?

129
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:28,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

130
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I used guides?

131
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:30,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.

132
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:42,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I can't think of how many times I've been out there and I've Googled, you know, I'm out there playing Pokemon Go and I don't know Pokemon as well as a Shane or even like a Mike Deft or somebody in our chat that plays Pokemon all the time.

133
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:42,773
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

134
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:28,907
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the first things on there but like some of these guides are just kind of dumb like they're not guides they're just it's it's it's call it a guide would be well just very disingenuous it's it's it's a listicle is what it is or it's nine things you it's something no one would type into google

135
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:30,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

136
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:45,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not gonna type in 9 things to know before starting Rise of the Ronin, or 18 things to know before starting Dragon's Dogma 2, or how about Final Fantasy VII's Rebirth, best materia for dealing magic damage, like... What should I do before starting Dragon Dogmas 2?

137
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That's... that's what they're typing.

138
00:07:47,905 --> 00:08:02,382
[SPEAKER_05]: refund your game done there you go that's what you do okay because it's trash fifth dream points out the reader view that's a really good point uh it doesn't always work but you're right i should remember it for some of those sites uh that tend to have you know just loaded up with all the garbage

139
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:14,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And over in our chat, of course, again, I should mention, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

140
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby's actually in our chat saying, nobody goes to Kotaku for guides, but they go to Google for guides, and Kotaku wants to be on the top of the Google search results.

141
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Therein is the problem.

142
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:39,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I understand a little bit superficially anyway, the superficial layer of guides are always going to get hits because people are going to start games late or the game is going to have life forever like a Pokemon game would.

143
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:46,554
[SPEAKER_05]: People are new to those games every day or a Zelda or a lot of Nintendo properties, people are visiting those games for the first time every day.

144
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So those guides are going to have a long life.

145
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:50,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So at a superficial level, I understand.

146
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

147
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,330
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be at the top of the Google search results.

148
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I did What to Know, Dragon's Dogma 2.

149
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:15,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing I get is I get multiple posts on Dragon's Dogma.

150
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:20,874
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got RPG forums or RPG Watch, several YouTube videos, IGN.

151
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:41,332
[SPEAKER_04]: more youtube videos, pc games n, kotaku is like way down in there, and gamespot they're all doing this so like if they're all do all of these companies are doing this you're not unique in this this thing and and these guides if you will are always those

152
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:50,701
[SPEAKER_04]: The slideshow articles, you know what I'm talking about where it's like it's a list and it's a slideshow that you have to click through the list and then there's a ton of ads thrown in there.

153
00:09:50,701 --> 00:10:04,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the same trash that is literally all over the internet and a lot of it nowadays is AI generated so you know that if that's what they're looking for and they need editors to do it

154
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,430
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

155
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:26,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, probably YouTube will do it better anyways.

156
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:33,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole thing I was gonna say is that, you know, for as much as we're talking about this particular website, it is the exact same thing over on YouTube.

157
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the exact same thing over on YouTube.

158
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:42,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And it right on down to the stuff that tends to get a lot of hits on YouTube are the evergreen guide type questions.

159
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:45,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, you get a video that shows you how to do it after

160
00:10:46,115 --> 00:11:14,330
[SPEAKER_05]: four or five minutes of all of this setup and background where they tell you the background everything and why are they doing that they're trying to increase increase the watch minutes because that's a stat that goes into advertising you know revenue eligibility and all this stuff on YouTube that's why a question that could be answered in fucking 30 seconds is a 10 minute video on YouTube and people do this all the time and it's the and it's the exact same thing those videos tend to get more hits because people that's what people are searching on YouTube and so forth um

161
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's interesting is that look at what's successful on YouTube in the non-evergreen space.

162
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You create a sense of, well, there's kind of two things.

163
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:35,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Shock content or, you know, unfortunately things that are extreme viewpoints, which is a whole other issue and stuff that creates a sense of brand loyalty, basically.

164
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And I,

165
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:50,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I am sad to hear that Kotaku and a lot of other websites out there have no interest in kind of creating that sort of brand loyalty anymore through well-written, well-researched articles and so forth.

166
00:11:50,121 --> 00:12:01,090
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is such a complicated issue because as much as I sit here and go, that's a very valuable thing to have, I also completely realize that the social media world we live in has ruined a lot of that.

167
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:19,607
[SPEAKER_05]: no more is there a website to do an article about this news event that happened when somebody's tweeting about it in 200 characters or less or whatever social media you use Facebook same thing even fucking your tick tock and Instagram all of it like it's have hmm

168
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:31,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really tangible example of how just the mindset of the masses has turned when it comes to reading or news or any sort of delivery of information.

169
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:35,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's look at old Apple computer ads.

170
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:38,998
[SPEAKER_02]: How they were all, they showed you the product.

171
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, you know, the nice big logo and several paragraphs of information about the thing they were advertising.

172
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,884
[SPEAKER_02]: All set in Adobe Garamond Pro.

173
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look at your ads.

174
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Big picture, one word.

175
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, look at your ads, you know, you would get so much information, you know, like call this number, do this thing, blah, blah, blah.

176
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:23,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's just like face QR code.

177
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:32,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, I really I really did like how informative those iPod commercials were with the people dancing in the chords for their headphones.

178
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:34,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about commercials.

179
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:35,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about print ads.

180
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Who looks at print ads?

181
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a whole other problem, right?

182
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:45,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the thing is, web apps technically count as a print ad.

183
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:49,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It's roughly the same equivalent just in digital form.

184
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a solitary, stationary thing.

185
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:59,297
[SPEAKER_02]: But it goes back into, you know, there was so much text and so much information to look at.

186
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's, here's your big ad.

187
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:05,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to catch your attention within a second.

188
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask to get the point across.

189
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:24,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly think, and we went over some of this when I was in graphic design school, that there is a change in psychology where the mind today is processing information at a so much faster speed because we've been acclimatized to it.

190
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:34,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's now what media is catering to, is that fast, bite-sized, digestible piece of information.

191
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:43,301
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how much information can we convey, you know, without you having to read several paragraphs worth of stuff?

192
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:48,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, too, we're having people, you know, forgetting entire methods of writing.

193
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:50,903
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing that's happening in Japan with writing kanji.

194
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:53,283
[SPEAKER_02]: People were just letting their text autofill.

195
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a lot of the same here.

196
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:06,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But going back to it, you know, people are typing and they're forgetting skills in writing.

197
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:13,840
[SPEAKER_02]: People are losing ability to think critically if the information is presented to them in a quick and easy and makes sense format.

198
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,241
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't fact check.

199
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:18,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know if there's anything to substantiate it.

200
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:21,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, I'd say, 90% of Twitter these days.

201
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:39,309
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of it, every, and Bobby is correct that it wasn't just Apple, but I'm saying in general, those are the ones you can probably find the easiest examples of, or that might stick out in the memory a little bit more for people.

202
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are...

203
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:50,426
[SPEAKER_02]: We are given the information that people want us to think at the right time.

204
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:53,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think, where the danger lies.

205
00:15:53,708 --> 00:16:08,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that... I mean, I'm going to sound like, you know, the old guy on the lawn shaking his cane to get off the lawn and yelling at clouds, but... What did clouds do to you?

206
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:08,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil said it.

207
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:18,698
[SPEAKER_02]: People would rather follow the opinions of those they think are popular than form their own because we don't want to think.

208
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:22,563
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now conditioned not to think.

209
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:26,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We're conditioned to take the information at a glance and if it's inconvenient, boohoo.

210
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,271
[SPEAKER_05]: and algorithms are just playing into all of that.

211
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:36,934
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that, what you just said, which in my opinion, you know, and I've I've said this for a while, is what makes Twitter so damn dangerous.

212
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:41,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would love nothing more than to see that site go down tomorrow permanently.

213
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:45,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I realize some people are just going to say, oh, you're just a hater, robber or whatever.

214
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:47,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I I don't know.

215
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think a lot of that, like nothing would make me happier than for Twitter to be gone tomorrow.

216
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:53,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing would make me happier.

217
00:16:53,823 --> 00:17:01,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I think some of these sorts of trends about, you know, we're because we're sitting here talking about this.

218
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, like, this is one of the few times where I'm just sitting here going, yeah, it sucks.

219
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:07,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what we can do about it.

220
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:15,261
[SPEAKER_05]: This was going to be a colossal shift in how we seek out information and how we parse information for this situation to change.

221
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:25,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't see how how this changes and this sucks because I feel like is it the right call for Kotaku to make money?

222
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:25,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

223
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:26,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

224
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:32,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in finance, but I can see superficially that, yeah, it probably leans into them getting more hits and influencing Google search results.

225
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:40,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it ethically the right thing to do for them to have hired these writers that wanted to come in and work for a gaming website that everybody knew about?

226
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And is it ethically the right thing?

227
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not.

228
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:44,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sucks.

229
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,961
[SPEAKER_05]: and props to the editor-in-chief for doing what they did.

230
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:49,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares about ethics when there's money?

231
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Bingo.

232
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:51,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Bingo.

233
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

234
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:57,383
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm, you know, I'm also starting to see, this is a semi-prediction.

235
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:59,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It may or may not happen.

236
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:11,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to start seeing a new trend in labor laws that are going to try to help preserve jobs for the human element.

237
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:11,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

238
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:11,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

239
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:26,500
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, like so and such percent of the workforce must be be human and not AI and must be able to fill these functions and then work hours, et cetera.

240
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,888
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already talking about lowering us to a 32 hour a week thing, which honestly, I don't think would be bad as long as our income stays the same.

241
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:35,108
[SPEAKER_02]: But

242
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:57,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, there's another thing too, and this is a little bit of a me thing, is that I've been very interested in going back and finishing my sociology degree and interspacing it with trends on the internet and communities and see how we look at our communities with the same sort of psychological

243
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:07,748
[SPEAKER_02]: attachment, that might not be the best word, of going to hang out with your friends in real life, you know what I mean?

244
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:18,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, I'm, you know, like, if I say, oh, I'm gonna go hang out my friend stream, I say it like I'm gonna go hang out with my friend, you know?

245
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:26,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a change in overall psychology with, with how we're wired today.

246
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:38,412
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rob, Loki, you know, Bobby, you know, people who are, I would say, like this late Gen X or early, what was that?

247
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Gen Y?

248
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:39,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Millennial?

249
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:40,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

250
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:41,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Millennial.

251
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,253
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xennial crowd.

252
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say the Xennial crowd.

253
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:47,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it, but I'm using it.

254
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:53,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We all grew up when the first computers were in their infancy.

255
00:19:54,815 --> 00:20:09,382
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a very unique generation with all of this because we have gone from the days where we saw things explained and things spelled out and we had to research and we had to use a freaking encyclopedia and we had to know how to think critically.

256
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:13,484
[SPEAKER_02]: We played outside and we came in and played our Nintendos, you know.

257
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:18,427
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew up with all of this as it grew up.

258
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:27,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this puts us in a unique position to understand where that transition was happening and to have seen it change and participated in it.

259
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense?

260
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

261
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:47,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that more than anything, I think that that puts us in exactly the unique position as well as being able to suggest not necessarily how to combat it, but how to

262
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the word I'm thinking of?

263
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:52,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Lessen the blow.

264
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make my words happen right now.

265
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:54,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a moment.

266
00:20:54,457 --> 00:21:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and not to take this too far to a weird place, but to your point, you know, when you talk about how can change actually happen, we are also probably the most under-represented generation, racially, when you talk about politics, because there's a certain other generation that won't get out of politics.

267
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:28,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing, too, is that we actually have also a very special place in the land of politics because we were new voters right around the era of Rock the Vote.

268
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:29,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?

269
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Voter P. Diddy will kill you.

270
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,567
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a little later, but still, you know.

271
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, that pretty much came up with, I'd say, the Clinton election for Bill Clinton.

272
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:41,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But the MTV voting campaign.

273
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:41,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

274
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:42,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

275
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:46,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had a relatively younger candidate who played sax on TV.

276
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm voting for him.

277
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:48,090
[SPEAKER_02]: He plays sax.

278
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I play sax.

279
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,451
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

280
00:21:50,211 --> 00:22:04,055
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we had that point where they were realizing much more the value of the younger voter in that by shaping what we did now, we would be setting a precedence for the future.

281
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:12,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really remember seeing the kind of marketing made to younger voters as what I've seen since my late teens and up.

282
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:23,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you know, yes, I mean, but that's also playing into it is that now we have we have the age behind us.

283
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: We we can all run for president if we wanted to.

284
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us, but but this is my point.

285
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:41,138
[SPEAKER_02]: We we have the experience behind us and we're still relatively young enough, I think, that we haven't quite lost touch with how the world works.

286
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:45,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of us have tried to stay in the loop, I'll put it that way.

287
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,793
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people who are way out of the loop.

288
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:53,560
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point remains, we had that perspective that no other generation has.

289
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:56,599
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:25,100
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of old gaming print ads I've seen from the 80s were text walls with art and no screenshots, but maybe showing off the game box for a bit of spice.

291
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

292
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby brings up like an example, a recent example where you can kind of see this now.

293
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:36,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby says that's the interesting thing about the Gold Master series stuff, which we've talked about before on this show.

294
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:41,608
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they have the Gold Master, Digital Eclipse, been doing the Gold Master Karateka, and they just released the Jeff Minder one.

295
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:42,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played that yet.

296
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Bobby talked about it on his show a little bit, but

297
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:52,394
[SPEAKER_05]: In the Gold Master series, they show a lot of the ads of the games from back then, and it's very descriptive.

298
00:23:52,394 --> 00:24:00,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of what I've really enjoyed, at least about the Karateka, and I imagine the Jeff Minter one's very similar, is that it's really an interesting peek behind the curtain

299
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,203
[SPEAKER_05]: of really how the games went from start to finish at that point.

300
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:07,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very fascinating.

301
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:07,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that stuff.

302
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:13,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really for those of you that are ever going to ask the question, how did we get here in gaming?

303
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:17,211
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're ever going to ask yourself that question, I think this is a really fun trip to take.

304
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:21,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Digital Eclipse has done a really good job so far with this series, for sure.

305
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:25,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So an Atari 50 is kind of Gold Master Zero, to be honest.

306
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you know, that was it was the first sort of

307
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:31,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut Proof of Concept of that whole thing.

308
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:46,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, yeah, it's, you know, a lot of people kind of reminiscing about you have to wait a break man saying you used to have to wait until six or 11 to find out what was happening in the world, or the next day in the paper.

309
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:47,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a very

310
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:55,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Perceptive sort of look at this versus what happens today, where now it's like immediately on your phone and it's everywhere.

311
00:24:55,467 --> 00:25:08,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I remember and I think, you know, not to get too weird, but since you brought up the Xeniel generation, I would say probably the news media event that unites us all would have been the Challenger explosion.

312
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:12,399
[SPEAKER_05]: when the space shuttle, you know, and because why is that?

313
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:14,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were all in grade school when it happened.

314
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Our generation was in grade school when it happened.

315
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:21,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody has a sense of where were you when that whole thing happened?

316
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:26,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And some, depending on what coast you're at, the East Coasters, I think a lot of them saw it live.

317
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a very shocking thing.

318
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:34,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for us on the West Coast, that was like a 6 a.m., 6.30 a.m., so not everybody saw it.

319
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:36,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remember being told- I was in Alabama.

320
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, did you see it live?

321
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,772
[SPEAKER_02]: We were watching the launch live.

322
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, see.

323
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:44,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched that shit live.

324
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:44,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

325
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny.

326
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:52,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how a couple of Fridays ago, I had a fuck it Friday with my ballet friends.

327
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:57,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are younger, of course, and had only heard of it, not actually seen it.

328
00:25:57,426 --> 00:25:59,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, do you want to see what we saw?

329
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:03,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my other friend had lived in Central Time as well.

330
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:10,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put it up and watched and they both looked at us and said, how are you not fucked up growing up with that?

331
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:12,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, little do you know.

332
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:12,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

333
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:22,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then like, well, every generation also kind of had, I would say the generation after us has 9-11 as an example of, you know, that similar sort of thing.

334
00:26:22,554 --> 00:26:26,236
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, that was really playing out live for a lot of people, right?

335
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:30,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, my point is, when that all happened, being on the West Coast, I had friends who were in the damn building.

336
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't find out about the Challenger until my second grade teacher showed up late.

337
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were all wondering where the teacher was.

338
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And she showed up late and she had to tell the class what happened and why she was late.

339
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:40,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

340
00:26:52,472 --> 00:27:09,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning in class we had been there for a couple of hours and we were all excited we drew pictures of of shuttles and all of this stuff and we were all we put our desks in like a semicircle around the class TV that they bring out on that big black stand on the wheels yep

341
00:27:10,157 --> 00:27:16,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and we were all like, and for me, like, when I was that age, I kind of wanted to be an astronaut.

342
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:18,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is a big deal for me.

343
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this to happen.

344
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:35,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just watching it explode into our, you know, young 10 year old minds, you know, we were, we had no concept of how dangerous a mission like that could be until we saw it ourselves.

345
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:36,750
[SPEAKER_05]: and

346
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:00,956
[SPEAKER_05]: hit the tower around again, six kind of early I wasn't up for work.

347
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:01,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I was awake.

348
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:08,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just I distinctly remember he Bobby says this is evergreen content kind of the whole where were you moment?

349
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:12,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I distinctly remember because I'm, I'm going to choose my words very carefully.

350
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But I lived with someone at the time.

351
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:20,614
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

352
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:40,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Richard and I went on our first date the night before.

353
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:41,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was that.

354
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:57,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remember getting up that morning and I'm getting ready to go to work and I walk out and my crazy ex-roommate was like, well, a plane just hit the World Trade Center and there's a bunch of planes still up in the sky and we don't know where they're headed and they're going to probably crash and other things.

355
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:58,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great day at work.

356
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:58,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

357
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez.

358
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you are so like him though.

359
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:09,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, and I was like, like in my in my head, I'm like, dry manner, such a bitch, like in my head.

360
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:13,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just I just got in the car, which and it didn't like nothing hit me.

361
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:17,557
[SPEAKER_05]: All I could think about is like, what a fucking bitch this guy was basically.

362
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:19,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hated this situation I was in.

363
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:23,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ended up driving to work.

364
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, I was listening to Howard Stern.

365
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:28,597
[SPEAKER_05]: because

366
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:47,123
[SPEAKER_05]: not normal that day, right?

367
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:56,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very like, you know, and it was when I was hearing this, I was like, Oh my God, like the reality of the situation hit me.

368
00:29:56,064 --> 00:30:01,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember getting to work and I just like sat in the parking lot and I didn't even want to go in the building, but I did eventually.

369
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:07,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody was just huddled around somebody's little black and white TV that they would watch soap operas on while they did their work.

370
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:13,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I went to get up to check, um, to check the weather.

371
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:18,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was on the Weather Channel.

372
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:26,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I think I like had like my little Nokia or my, you remember my Sony Ericsson phone?

373
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:31,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, I pull out my phone the first thing and I call Grandmom.

374
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Grandmom, turn on the TV.

375
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what channel?

376
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:37,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, it doesn't matter, pick one.

377
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a news channel.

378
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:39,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she looks at it and says,

379
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jamie, what am I looking at?

380
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:49,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told her, and we were on the phone together right when the second one hit.

381
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to work.

382
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,101
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when I was working for the money store.

383
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, after it was the money store, but you know, subprime lending.

384
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:00,002
[SPEAKER_02]: We hardly got a call all day.

385
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:06,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually got a call from a coworker because this is at the time that First Union had merged.

386
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, like, I'm just like, I'm calling because I need to see if like, if someone like if my daughter had called here, because we had people who are calling us to check on their family.

387
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:34,499
[SPEAKER_02]: who were employees for, uh, you know, like we, we can't route that information, but I talked to one person who had gotten out of the building after the second one hit.

388
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:41,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend who had gone to her lunch break before the first one and did not go back clearly.

389
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:51,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one who was actually under rubble and was saved because of, uh, the way like something fell on her propped up, uh,

390
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:59,483
[SPEAKER_02]: enough of the rubble to keep her from getting crushed and like her phone ringer was alerting people to where she was.

391
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:19,708
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about the way how we have consumed news now has completely changed.

392
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:24,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Because think about how something like that now plays out on Twitter.

393
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:27,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a different sort of thing.

394
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, for big gaming alerts and things like that,

395
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's just, it's very interesting how a lot of that has changed.

396
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:48,037
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I'm also reading chat, and sjo100mat makes a very interesting point that's a little bit humbling, saying that for topical purposes, I found out about Bin Laden was found and killed while listening to OLR.

397
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:56,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might remember, that's the interesting thing about doing the show live, is that that happened while we were in the middle of the show.

398
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:06,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember having to say, because we were at your house at the time, I think, doing this live, DarkSakura, and I remember at the time having to say like, um, I know this is weird, but there's like a big thing going on.

399
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:08,539
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to like talk about it for a second.

400
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, kind of got into that.

401
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:10,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very,

402
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:12,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

403
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:24,989
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very humbling, thinking about that that was a very big news story of a different time, and how maybe we are entwined with that for some people is very, very humbling.

404
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:37,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you today, if something like that happened, if we had another big, you know, terrorist, well, actually, look at the terrorist attack on Israel, how that played out.

405
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:45,569
[SPEAKER_02]: How there were live tweets, tweets coming from people who were, oh my God, they're outside of my house.

406
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:49,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, text messages, things like that.

407
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That is how our news is being reported.

408
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how big attacks like this is being reported.

409
00:33:54,411 --> 00:34:00,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and it's also a lot of it is, here it is, and here's how you should feel about it.

410
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:01,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

411
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:06,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of recycling of, I'm just going to say it like this, other people's content.

412
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:06,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sure.

413
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:18,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having a free interview with an eyewitness, but they're taking it and just their articles are predominantly taken up by other people's tweets and then speculation on it.

414
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that that's that that's like the eyewitness news kind of thing.

415
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:25,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how they're doing a lot of stories today.

416
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:33,665
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Pop Crave's entire thing is just finding the hit tweet and putting their own spin on it and retweeting it.

417
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:38,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all the people that follow that site.

418
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:39,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fascinating.

419
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:41,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

420
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes back to people not doing their own research again and putting out speculation that people are taking as fact.

421
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:51,838
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, it is a video game show, believe it or not, but it's also a video game community.

422
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:58,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about and again, I'm sorry to leave this lead story as, wow, this sucks.

423
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:01,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I don't know what else we can do about this.

424
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this this doesn't change unless there is a fundamental way and how we consume in a fundamental change in the way we consume information.

425
00:35:09,448 --> 00:35:10,309
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not happening tomorrow.

426
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:16,220
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just wait until we have the chips that download how we think into our head.

427
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hold on because we have a story coming up on that later.

428
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:25,263
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

429
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:27,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, what games have you been playing this week?

430
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:34,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been playing a good bit of Avatar again.

431
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:38,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sort of putting off ending the game.

432
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:42,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I found that you can keep playing when the game is done, so I might do that.

433
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:45,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like, I'm going to be a Navi for the rest of ever.

434
00:35:45,835 --> 00:35:49,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Dead by Daylight.

435
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:54,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be playing, of course, more today because I want to get through the Blood Moon thing.

436
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't touched Killer at all during it.

437
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:07,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing the Saturn Castlevania Symphony of the Night, or Nocturne in the Moonlight.

438
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:14,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm in that exploring and locating shit phase, although I think I got four familiars and other forms.

439
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:18,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the mist form, the bat form, and the wolf form.

440
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got the other power-ups for those.

441
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:27,285
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still need to get the Spikebreaker armor so I can go get the walk armor.

442
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:36,521
[SPEAKER_02]: The walk armor, if no one knows, is the best armor to have in that game when you have done over 100% map completion.

443
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:39,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the more of the map that you fill up, the stronger your armor gets.

444
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:52,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm trying to get back down to the, the, um, the catacombs so I can fight some werewolves and get a Yatatsuna, which to me is the best weapon in the game short of the, uh, the jeweled fist.

445
00:36:52,667 --> 00:37:06,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yes, the Saturn version is better, but what's awesome about the one that I'm playing is that it has the English dialogue, um, from the PSP version or the PlayStation one that came out.

446
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:09,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that being a story on the show several weeks ago that that patch was, yeah.

447
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:15,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had it downloaded then, I just hadn't started it, I think, or maybe I had just started it.

448
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:26,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still got a lot of the Japanese voices left in there, which is funny, because you get dialogue in one language, and then

449
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:40,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You get, you know, you hear it in, you know, the background stuff in Japanese, but they also bumped it up to where it takes full advantage of the Saturn's capability, where the one that we got originally was very rushed.

450
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:44,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it, I paid 20 bucks for it when it came out, you know, and now it's going for mega bucks.

451
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:59,144
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just wasn't super polished and it didn't use a lot of the better transparency effects and the better 2D animation that the Saturn was capable of.

452
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very well done.

453
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the game should have been.

454
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:05,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

455
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:11,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I played something else, but I don't remember.

456
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:17,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh, yeah, we took out Weird Al because Dan hosted League.

457
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:20,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we put in Final Resistance on the P3.

458
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:23,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So we played some of that.

459
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:25,660
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll go over to Loki.

460
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,221
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

461
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play much other than, you know, Minecraft.

462
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:34,527
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been working on a big Redstone project.

463
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,230
[SPEAKER_04]: That's now done.

464
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually editing the video for it.

465
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:47,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a big super smelter and it's awesome because it's very fast and ridiculously large.

466
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:48,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be coming very soon.

467
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, maybe even tomorrow.

468
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:58,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm taking some time off this week to work on the first theme park ride because it's taking a lot of time to

469
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:19,142
[SPEAKER_04]: build all that and conceptualize it and get everything working so I'm getting closer there each day but yeah mostly this week it's been movies so I saw the new Ghostbusters movie yesterday and then on Thursday I saw Rad which is an old BMX

470
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:21,783
[SPEAKER_04]: DMX movie from 1986.

471
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:25,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell, I love that fucking movie.

472
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:25,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

473
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: They had it in theaters for a rad day.

474
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

475
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,727
[SPEAKER_04]: My kids did not want to stay for the Q&A afterwards.

476
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:39,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was a little bit bummed there because they had, I guess, Ed Helms from like The Office, the comedian.

477
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:46,133
[SPEAKER_04]: He was hosting the Q&A with I don't know who it was supposed to be because it was all through that like Fathom Events thing.

478
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,313
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently he writes BMX.

479
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:49,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew?

480
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:49,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Like,

481
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:54,256
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a thing he does though, and I guess he's a fan of the movie, so it would have been interesting.

482
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:57,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I've been trying to get him to see that movie forever now.

483
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:05,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now we have to watch all of the different extreme sports, like, movies.

484
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:09,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, there's... Show him Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

485
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:11,464
[SPEAKER_02]: There's BMX in that.

486
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:12,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is.

487
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:13,405
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

488
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:19,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Thrasher was just one... I think it's Thrasher or Thrash, which I was just...

489
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:38,840
[SPEAKER_04]: reminded of, I've never seen it, but like I, it was in another video I was watching, but like, um, you know, Gleaming the Cube and, and, uh, you know, a little bit later Airborne, which is, you know, the like Rollerblade type movie, um, to go along with all this type of stuff.

490
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember Solar Babies?

491
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:41,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

492
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:49,599
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like stuck in this area, but they played like some weird version of lacrosse.

493
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,080
[SPEAKER_02]: God, there was another one too that I was thinking of.

494
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what you mean.

495
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Prayer of the Rollerboys was another one.

496
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:56,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, yes.

497
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:58,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Prayer of the Rollerboys.

498
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:00,103
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.

499
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:03,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, even I guess, oh God, what was the other one?

500
00:41:03,605 --> 00:41:05,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Robot Jocks.

501
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:07,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

502
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:24,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fine.

503
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:24,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

504
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:30,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, certainly it's not going to be as good as the last one because the last one was essentially remaking the first movie.

505
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:35,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's just like, how much nostalgia can we inject into your veins?

506
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:43,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one's a little bit more normal, but there's like, I don't know, like the old Ghostbusters cast.

507
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:59,401
[SPEAKER_04]: like some of like okay Bill Murray phoning it in I mean he's in it for like a couple minutes really didn't even need to be in the movie like there's no point for it um it was okay and then there's there's also like

508
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:03,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm just rolling my eyes because it's ridiculous.

509
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, who cares?

510
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:15,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's a scene with, um, this ghost girl and the young, uh, Spengler and there, there's like some chemistry there.

511
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:19,867
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know if it's friendship of, oh no, maybe it's lesbian chemistry.

512
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:20,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Who gives a shit?

513
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:21,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just a movie.

514
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:24,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but people are making a big deal about dumb shit like that.

515
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Like who cares?

516
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:26,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

517
00:42:26,932 --> 00:42:27,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I was okay.

518
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:28,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't interested in the movie.

519
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:37,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a reason that they they took out the the ghost sex scene with Dan Aykroyd.

520
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

521
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:42,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't interested in this movie until you told me I'm missing out on lesbian ghosts.

522
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:44,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, hell yeah.

523
00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:46,684
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be the tagline.

524
00:42:46,684 --> 00:42:48,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they calling it Frozen Empire?

525
00:42:48,445 --> 00:42:51,127
[SPEAKER_05]: They should have called it Ghostbusters Lesbian Ghosts.

526
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:52,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be into that.

527
00:42:52,788 --> 00:43:21,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the thing like even with all that like it's the best description I've heard of it is it they said it feels like someone took an episode of the real Ghostbusters and gave them the budget to make a full movie based off of one episode of that show and that's kind of yeah it kind of feels like that a little bit it's like kind of the ghost of the week you know they explain it it's not really tied into the old movies or anything it's just it's just a ghost that's trying to

528
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:27,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara was telling me this morning that they thought it started off really strong and kind of fizzled at the end.

529
00:43:51,784 --> 00:43:53,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what a lot of people have been saying.

530
00:43:53,225 --> 00:43:53,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

531
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:56,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't really feel like the pacing was slow to me.

532
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:59,948
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of like... I don't know.

533
00:43:59,948 --> 00:44:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people that are like characters from the first movie that just like...

534
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, look, I'm in New York now, too.

535
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, look, I'm in New York now, too.

536
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:12,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like, where are all these people coming from?

537
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they here for no reason?

538
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:15,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all in New York right now.

539
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:15,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

540
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:21,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, hey, you're you podcast, you know, the character from the last movie from Oklahoma City.

541
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:26,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, now you're helping Ray film his like podcast like.

542
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:27,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

543
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:31,196
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the trailer for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice?

544
00:44:31,196 --> 00:44:31,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see it.

545
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:32,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about Beetlejuice.

546
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:58,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Lydia is still hyper goth.

547
00:45:00,953 --> 00:45:02,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just so happy Catherine O'Hara is still in it.

548
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:07,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got, yes, I was about to say they got the lady, the legend.

549
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:15,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, and it's very obvious who dies at the beginning because only one of the original cast of Beetlejuice is in jail for very, very, very bad crimes.

550
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:22,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so anyway, or maybe on parole, but on a registry at this point.

551
00:45:22,063 --> 00:45:24,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will not be making any more movies, rightfully so.

552
00:45:24,384 --> 00:45:24,624
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

553
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:27,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, although the first movie still has one of my favorite lines.

554
00:45:28,496 --> 00:45:33,229
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't let me gut out this house and make it my own, I will go insane and I will take you with me.

555
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:34,492
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

556
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:35,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to games.

557
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:36,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, any other games?

558
00:45:38,047 --> 00:45:39,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, that was it.

559
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:40,649
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

560
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:41,349
[SPEAKER_05]: My Game of Week.

561
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:47,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have, of course, the good old favorites like Final Fantasy 14, still working on that.

562
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:47,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Still playing.

563
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:52,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I even I even signed into Dead by Daylight this week, which I haven't played in months.

564
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:54,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a match.

565
00:45:54,497 --> 00:45:56,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I passed away because I didn't have very good team.

566
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:58,219
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I escaped one of them.

567
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:03,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a couple matches because I escaped one of them because I got called selfish because I left somebody on the hook.

568
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:03,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like,

569
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:05,785
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

570
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,564
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to play The Unknown.

571
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:44,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess I'll check it out at some point.

572
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not... The Unknown is the first super fun killer we've had in the game.

573
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:50,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

574
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't... I didn't go against them in any of the matches I played.

575
00:46:53,182 --> 00:46:56,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had like a... I don't even remember what it was.

576
00:46:56,525 --> 00:47:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, just... It takes the good parts of... Well, I mean, I love Sadako as well, but it takes kind of the good parts of Sadako and Dredge.

577
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:09,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And then

578
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:16,727
[SPEAKER_02]: the good parts that should have been with the Singularity and marries them in utter creep fest.

579
00:47:16,727 --> 00:47:20,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Both games I played were against the Singularity for some reason.

580
00:47:20,749 --> 00:47:21,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

581
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:22,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Singularity has been having an uptick.

582
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:23,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

583
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um, but other stuff.

584
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about some non normal stuff?

585
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:30,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a couple games I played that were a little outside the norm for me.

586
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:31,733
[SPEAKER_05]: PlunderStorm

587
00:47:51,593 --> 00:47:57,998
[SPEAKER_05]: to go over to Plunderstorm and you have your basically like seasoned character or whatever, because this is only supposed to be a six week event.

588
00:47:57,998 --> 00:48:01,720
[SPEAKER_05]: And it essentially is World of Warcraft meets Fortnite.

589
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:13,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very intentionally them building a Fortnite type of thing into World of Warcraft, except instead of guns and shooting, it is using randomly acquired spells, which is a very interesting sort of thing.

590
00:48:13,148 --> 00:48:19,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So it puts a roguelike twist onto it, which I guess if you think about it, a lot of stuff in Fortnite is random as well.

591
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:20,533
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so you

592
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:37,826
[SPEAKER_05]: you would you uh kill uh mobs and npcs and sometimes they drop spells and you have to choose what spells to take out and then you also can grab plunder gold and occasionally you run into other players and you have to engage in combat and hopefully your spell kit is good enough and you're leveled

593
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:43,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of difficult in the beginning because it doesn't teach you a lot of what's going on.

594
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did stream it and most of my games were horrible.

595
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:54,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I was legit last place one of my games, 60th place, because I landed the exact same place someone else did and they took me out right away as much as I tried to fight it.

596
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, as 200 Matt does point out, I got top five one game.

597
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:03,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like fourth place one game, mostly because I ran around like a little bitch and just was like on the outskirts.

598
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:07,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to like find more NPCs to kill, but it kept me alive for a very long time.

599
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:09,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But one game I was on a roll.

600
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I killed three other people before I died.

601
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Just when I was starting to think, like, am I ever going to be able to kill somebody in this game, I got like three people in one match.

602
00:49:16,313 --> 00:49:17,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay.

603
00:49:17,494 --> 00:49:17,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise...

604
00:49:19,204 --> 00:49:20,585
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

605
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:27,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I anticipated I would do a three hour stream of Plunderstorm because I usually try to do a stream around three hours.

606
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:29,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I was done with it after an hour and a half.

607
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:31,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, all right, bored now.

608
00:49:31,414 --> 00:49:33,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, let's let's move on.

609
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:37,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure what kind of lasting power that has.

610
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably best as a sideshow.

611
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:44,185
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's cute that they're using the Warcraft engine to kind of do some of these things.

612
00:49:45,026 --> 00:49:50,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says maybe you need a guide of 10 things you should know before starting World of Warcraft's Fortnite mode.

613
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:54,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, go look up Plunderstorm on Kotaku.

614
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:58,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee that that guide exists, exactly what you just said.

615
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think I saw it on there as I was browsing the main page when all this other stuff came up.

616
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:04,943
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

617
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:25,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a little diversion.

618
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:33,044
[SPEAKER_05]: The other game I played that for me was brand new, and maybe you will be surprised to hear that I played this game, is I played Foam Stars.

619
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:40,129
[SPEAKER_05]: This game has been in the news a lot because there is a minimal amount of AI that they have used in the game.

620
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's gotten a lot of shit for that.

621
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:52,915
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say the AI is limited to very, very, very, all it is, it's when you're in the sound player, it's the album arts are very AI generated.

622
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:53,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

623
00:50:54,275 --> 00:50:56,719
[SPEAKER_05]: They look out of place.

624
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the fuck they were thinking with that whole thing.

625
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:03,150
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really bad decision to do that.

626
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing about Foamstars, and why did I play this game?

627
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:07,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Shane and I made an agreement.

628
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:11,344
[SPEAKER_05]: because he's been really into Foam Stars and enjoying it.

629
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:17,989
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, if you play Foam Stars on stream, I'll play a game that you want on stream later.

630
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:26,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And he assumed I would pick Diablo, but I was like, no, Diablo is kind of like, I don't think it's a good right now to like level with somebody.

631
00:51:26,136 --> 00:51:29,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So coming soon, because I think we're going to do it after the current event.

632
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:31,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make Shane play Dead by Daylight with me.

633
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:32,742
[SPEAKER_05]: He's never played before.

634
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:35,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be fun.

635
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned for that.

636
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So the agreement was I'll play Foam Stars.

637
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:39,287
[SPEAKER_05]: He plays Dead by Daylight.

638
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:41,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So I play Foam Stars.

639
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:42,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

640
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,311
[SPEAKER_05]: The game actually isn't bad.

641
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:46,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of people compare it to Splatoon.

642
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:48,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I get the Splatoon comparisons.

643
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:55,818
[SPEAKER_05]: But believe it or not, the whole like foam mechanic where you're actually riding on the foam and you don't really like go underneath it.

644
00:51:55,818 --> 00:52:00,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You're more like on this board where you can kind of like make walls and all this stuff.

645
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:03,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it does kind of end up being a very different sort of mechanic.

646
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:03,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And

647
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:33,422
[SPEAKER_05]: um uh you can uh the heroes that you play are more like overwatch in splatoon everything is very well you can do this weapon or that weapon have this ultimate or that ultimate and uh the way foam stars is put together is a little more of an overwatch sort of feeling but that stuff aside when when we would actually get into a match we didn't get into everything we queued up for because nobody's fucking playing this game anymore no but like people were playing this game for it's people aren't playing this fucking game

648
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:45,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's unfortunate because the game isn't bad, but this game is one of the most grossly mismanaged games I think I've seen in a very long time.

649
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And just yet another shining example of how the people at the top of the industry don't know what the fuck they're doing.

650
00:52:51,143 --> 00:52:53,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And this AI thing is an excellent example of that.

651
00:52:53,885 --> 00:52:58,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Sj100mat says, creating real album art is two weeks worth of work.

652
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,969
[SPEAKER_05]: The AI got it done in two hours.

653
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a bad fucking call.

654
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:07,212
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody should have gone outside and take photographs and used crappy Photoshop filters and put cheap text on them.

655
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:12,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have got them done in two hours and have them look just as just as compelling.

656
00:53:12,193 --> 00:53:14,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was a bad call.

657
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:15,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Or here's another idea.

658
00:53:15,835 --> 00:53:20,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't have you who says you need to have fucking album art on your sound test mode.

659
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:22,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't have it.

660
00:53:22,137 --> 00:53:24,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has nothing to do with the rest of the game.

661
00:53:24,097 --> 00:53:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you don't get all this negative present is a bad idea.

662
00:53:27,198 --> 00:53:29,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But even putting that aside,

663
00:53:30,353 --> 00:53:39,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Consider the fact that Foam Stars, a Square Enix product, launched the same day on PlayStation Plus as Helldivers 2.

664
00:53:39,938 --> 00:53:43,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So PlayStation, you know, obviously put a lot into that, and that game's big.

665
00:53:43,841 --> 00:53:51,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But then also, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth demo launched the same day as Foam Stars, also a Square Enix product.

666
00:53:52,492 --> 00:53:56,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game was really set up to fail on multiple perspectives.

667
00:53:56,355 --> 00:53:59,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's like, nothing is supporting this game.

668
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:04,361
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is gonna go ass up soon, because it's no longer free on PlayStation Plus.

669
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:14,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, don't pay $30 for this game, when there's all these like battle pass, microtransaction, all the shit you'd expect to see.

670
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:15,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it.

671
00:54:15,229 --> 00:54:16,210
[SPEAKER_05]: People aren't gonna do it.

672
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:24,132
[SPEAKER_05]: This game has been set up to fail by gross mismanagement and there's no other way around it because otherwise the game wasn't bad.

673
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:34,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun playing with Shane and playing on stream and I'm kind of surprised that I'm saying that because I remember when I played the demo, I didn't really care for it.

674
00:54:34,297 --> 00:54:43,022
[SPEAKER_05]: But playing the game with Shane gave me a perspective on the game that not even any fucking guide in the world could do.

675
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:51,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is somebody could just explain to me what to do and what I was seeing meant and what the strategy was in the current moment.

676
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody was able to like kind of walk me through that.

677
00:54:53,362 --> 00:54:58,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And that made the game like 100 times more fun, playing with somebody who kind of knows what they're talking about.

678
00:54:58,825 --> 00:55:06,089
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, the break man says so this is another case of publisher interference is the biggest problem, sort of.

679
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,400
[SPEAKER_05]: SSU 100 Matt.

680
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, is responding to a comment that Bobby Blackwolf made saying what is the TTP or time to penis and foam stars?

681
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:16,485
[SPEAKER_05]: When Rob starts playing is the answer.

682
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:19,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an interesting aside on this whole thing.

683
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:22,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is not something I usually care about.

684
00:55:22,748 --> 00:55:24,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to stress.

685
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:28,852
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was one of those things where I went, that's really fucking interesting.

686
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:30,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't get it.

687
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I had more viewers than I've ever had for a stream playing foam stars.

688
00:55:36,027 --> 00:55:37,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

689
00:55:37,048 --> 00:55:44,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I had I had almost I had an average of high 30s playing average.

690
00:55:44,794 --> 00:55:47,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't and again, I don't usually care about that shit.

691
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:48,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those things.

692
00:55:48,396 --> 00:55:50,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what?

693
00:55:50,238 --> 00:55:51,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

694
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:52,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

695
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I was like the only person playing it on Twitch.

696
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:56,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's part of the reason about it.

697
00:55:56,643 --> 00:56:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mike Dev says you dominated in the foam stars category because literally nobody else was playing it.

698
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:04,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was just interesting.

699
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:11,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, SGO100Matt says I got raided a couple times, which yeah, probably helped, but it's just, I, but I retained, I retained the raids.

700
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:13,077
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't usually happen.

701
00:56:13,077 --> 00:56:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, yeah, it was just a very, huh?

702
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of thing.

703
00:56:18,662 --> 00:56:20,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

704
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:21,725
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

705
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:22,626
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for my gaming week.

706
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:30,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about some gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.

707
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll start.

708
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:39,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but I will just mention really quick, because usually here's when we talk about housekeeping and what's going on in show news.

709
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:42,519
[SPEAKER_05]: FYI, tonight is episode 997.

710
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That means episode 1,000, which really was a thing that we could only really dream and joke about literally at one point when this show hits 1,000 episodes.

711
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:55,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I distinctly remember that in an old episode.

712
00:56:55,483 --> 00:57:00,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We joked, Oh, yeah, we'll never get to 1000 episodes, but it would happen in the year like 2023 or 2024, whatever.

713
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:05,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So April 14 is going to end up being our 1000th episode of Orange Launch Radio.

714
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:09,649
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the only weekly gaming podcast to get to 1000 episodes.

715
00:57:09,649 --> 00:57:13,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty wild to think about.

716
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:21,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So and I just want to say, you know, I don't expect that this is going to get a lot of traction because, you know, we have, of course, our podcast listeners that we love.

717
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:25,336
[SPEAKER_05]: We have maybe mid 20s viewing us on Twitch right now.

718
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:27,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not like, you know, top tier.

719
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:28,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fine.

720
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:28,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

721
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:29,598
[SPEAKER_05]: We've made peace of that work.

722
00:57:29,598 --> 00:57:35,941
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we have awesome people with us every week that keep us going.

723
00:57:35,941 --> 00:57:45,486
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just one of those things where it's like, it's really just kind of neat to kind of go like, holy shit, we did this thing that literally was only a dream.

724
00:57:45,486 --> 00:57:47,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to hit that landmark on April 14th.

725
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:48,468
[SPEAKER_05]: This is

726
00:57:49,557 --> 00:57:50,798
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wild and it's awesome.

727
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:53,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all who have been here for the ride.

728
00:57:53,922 --> 00:57:55,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's very deeply appreciated.

729
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:59,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, Bobby Blackwell says, I mean, we're in the top 1% of Twitch with our mid 20 viewers.

730
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:05,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, look, and I don't want to, I'm very thankful for every viewer that we have.

731
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:06,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

732
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:07,417
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is, is that

733
00:58:08,058 --> 00:58:15,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We're it's not like people that the mass the guide writing gaming media or the mainstream is going to give a shit.

734
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:29,368
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not a let's say Asmongold or something where that guy fucking farts and they write a news article about it on various websites that AI helps them generates, like or you know, a lot of other people Pokimane makes a decision about you know what she's doing.

735
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:31,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, again, every website starts to roll.

736
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:32,470
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not that and that's okay.

737
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the

738
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,372
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a lot of good things that come with not having a constant eye on you all the time.

739
00:58:38,372 --> 00:58:44,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it's just but I just, I don't expect that there's going to be a lot of fanfare and that's okay.

740
00:58:44,873 --> 00:58:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

741
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:48,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, SJ100Math says thank you for taking us along on your dream journey.

742
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:50,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there wouldn't be a journey if you all weren't here.

743
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So very much appreciate that.

744
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:56,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now we can actually get into some gaming news.

745
00:58:56,525 --> 00:58:57,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry Loki, go ahead.

746
00:58:57,926 --> 00:58:59,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

747
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So Steam Family Sharing is getting very interesting.

748
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:10,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they're going to be replacing Steam Families, essentially Steam Families is going to replace

749
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:12,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Support up to 6 family members total

750
00:59:28,254 --> 00:59:36,036
[SPEAKER_04]: with both offline availability and they said streamlined license availability is at long last.

751
00:59:36,036 --> 00:59:54,262
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think is really cool about it, though, is that basically like I could be playing a game on Steam and if my kids want to play one of the like other 900 probably games that I have, they can do that without any sort of interruption to what I'm doing.

752
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:55,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they said that

753
00:59:56,576 --> 01:00:03,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the game license owner can continue playing other games while one license is being shared with the family members.

754
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:08,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Users accessing shared games can now play them offline as well.

755
01:00:08,766 --> 01:00:17,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there was something, they're saying, yeah, retain all key features, including separate achievements, save games, and other player generated content.

756
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:23,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, my kids are very excited about this because I have a lot of games that they would like to play.

757
01:00:26,161 --> 01:00:29,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And some may actually end up having to use this.

758
01:00:29,783 --> 01:00:34,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they able to prevent people from sharing this across the distance?

759
01:00:34,105 --> 01:00:36,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

760
01:00:36,147 --> 01:00:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It just says you designate six family members.

761
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:42,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So I consider my friends family.

762
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's some of us.

763
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:44,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

764
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we can do that.

765
01:00:46,973 --> 01:00:47,333
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

766
01:00:49,373 --> 01:00:52,115
[SPEAKER_05]: E3VL says technically anyone can be family.

767
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:52,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

768
01:00:52,675 --> 01:00:54,517
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a risky maneuver.

769
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:58,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sounds like you can only add people or I'm sorry, remove.

770
01:00:58,479 --> 01:01:01,541
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've removed them, you can't replace them for like a year or something like that.

771
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they've put a very long like you can't just rotate your family in.

772
01:01:04,803 --> 01:01:07,525
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to think really hard about who you're gonna have, right?

773
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:10,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

774
01:01:10,385 --> 01:01:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwell says my wife likes this idea because she wants access to my Jackbox games on her laptop and I own them all on Steam.

775
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:18,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, Alan and I can consolidate our libraries too.

776
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:22,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he has anything that I like really want.

777
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:34,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's like here's here once again, like this is I like this type of thinking out of the box and stuff because like we have we know that there's another switch coming down the line here pretty soon.

778
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:37,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that, you know, mom or dad or whomever is

779
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Accumulating a large library of games that they don't play.

780
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:46,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be nice to like just be able to gift your kids a Steam deck or something like that?

781
01:01:46,176 --> 01:01:54,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And boom, now they have instant access to 800, 900 games, you know, like without any additional fees or charges.

782
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:57,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's a very good point.

783
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam's been around a while now.

784
01:01:58,626 --> 01:02:04,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Those folks that started Steam accounts in college and built up a library are probably parents of

785
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,192
[SPEAKER_05]: game playing age kids now.

786
01:02:07,192 --> 01:02:10,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have so many games and so many unredeemed games.

787
01:02:10,815 --> 01:02:15,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's ridiculous the amount of like I was trying to consult.

788
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:21,861
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way like I've gone through like humble but I wish there was a way to like mark off redeemed, not redeemed or whatever.

789
01:02:21,861 --> 01:02:30,467
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I had to compile like large files of just keys of games and like see cross reference what I have and stuff.

790
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:30,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It's

791
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.

792
01:02:32,871 --> 01:02:36,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Breakman in chat says, I was laughing at this comment.

793
01:02:36,072 --> 01:02:41,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Breakman says, LOL, dear children, my pile of shame is now your Merry Christmas.

794
01:02:41,494 --> 01:02:43,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

795
01:02:43,795 --> 01:02:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really funny.

796
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:46,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

797
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:46,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

798
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:55,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want like something that doesn't necessarily merge the libraries, you know, but gives you access to it.

799
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, that's what the old method did, right?

800
01:02:59,981 --> 01:03:01,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember, it's been a while.

801
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think this is merging.

802
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's better.

803
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:04,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

804
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sounds to me like it's merging them, and I don't think that's a good idea.

805
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:16,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if it's similar to the old method, you still see ultimately whose game it is on the Steam page before you launch it.

806
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:19,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan and I used to have a shared library, but it stopped at some point.

807
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know what we did, so yeah.

808
01:03:21,805 --> 01:03:23,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gets any of my stuff, I'm keeping it to myself.

809
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the difference now is before it used to be if someone was playing something from your library, you couldn't play anything from it.

810
01:03:31,751 --> 01:03:37,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they're saying, well, as long as it's not the same game you're playing, then it's fine.

811
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:39,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, cool.

812
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

813
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:40,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

814
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:50,242
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's move on and talk about some talks that happened at GDC because Game Developers Conference was this weekend.

815
01:03:50,242 --> 01:03:59,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And although there's not a ton, a ton of gaming news that usually comes out of Game Developers Conference, there's sometimes some interesting little tidbits as the industry looks at literally like how the sausage is made.

816
01:03:59,864 --> 01:04:05,245
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of game developers that come together and talk about, you know, what they've done for games, what's worked, what hasn't worked.

817
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:09,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes we do get news about, you know, new features for game creators.

818
01:04:09,587 --> 01:04:11,227
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into a story about that later.

819
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:17,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But for this, let's talk about a talk on Super Mario Brothers Wonder.

820
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:31,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was some slides that came out that were shared on Twitter talking about Nintendo's Super Mario Wonder team showing off different brainstorming sessions that it had in a talk that they were having.

821
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:35,826
[SPEAKER_05]: The game's directors, Shiro Mori and producer Takashi Tezuka,

822
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:39,587
[SPEAKER_05]: were sharing some insight about what went into the process.

823
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:45,890
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the brainstorming sessions had Mario surfing, riding a unicycle, jumping on a pogo stick.

824
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised that wasn't something they went with.

825
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:50,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds kind of fun.

826
01:04:50,132 --> 01:04:55,954
[SPEAKER_05]: They also even went as far as to have Wonder Effect testing sessions and unused Wonder Effects.

827
01:04:55,954 --> 01:05:03,698
[SPEAKER_05]: There was even a prototype level that was completely cut with a giant block Mario where enemies were chomping away at his head.

828
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:09,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Player turns into a giant block Mario and advances while avoiding getting eaten.

829
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:11,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it sounds pretty cool.

830
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Could make for a very interesting Mario Maker later on if they ever went that way, but who knows?

831
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:27,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also in the talk or previously to the talk, some of the folks behind Super Mario Brothers Wonder have mentioned how they prototyped all sorts of things.

832
01:05:27,014 --> 01:05:31,116
[SPEAKER_05]: They had over 2000 ideas that went into this game and just some of the

833
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:45,975
[SPEAKER_05]: best ones were actually of course the ones that made it into the game uh there was a yoshi egg throwing mechanic that you saw in prior games uh also apparently miyamoto was not a big fan of the early elephant designs and so that was refined a little bit so

834
01:05:46,816 --> 01:05:47,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, interesting.

835
01:05:47,917 --> 01:06:00,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those are sorts of the, like what was left on the cutting room floor, sorts of things that you hear on GDC talks and fascinating stuff, but not usually the type of stuff that makes news headlines.

836
01:06:00,404 --> 01:06:03,365
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hope everybody that went to GDC had a really good time.

837
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:06,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there was a lot of very interesting things going on at GDC.

838
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:11,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently at some point there was a gathering of folks from the industry to let out a cathartic scream.

839
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:18,515
[SPEAKER_05]: in front of GDC just just to reflect on the state of the gaming industry, layoffs, etc.

840
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:21,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody just fucking screamed for a minute.

841
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure I'm sure the police were called.

842
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:30,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's those types of interesting events, you know, that probably made for a unique GDC this year.

843
01:06:30,645 --> 01:06:31,706
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

844
01:06:31,706 --> 01:06:33,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, moving on DarkSakura.

845
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:35,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Whale.

846
01:06:57,841 --> 01:07:03,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they can find ways of communicating with people through digital means.

847
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:15,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first patient that had the chip installed, named Noland Arbaugh, has been able to do some cool things like playing video games.

848
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:27,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So, one of the first things, and by the way, I should also say that he's only had a few issues with it, but no cognitive impairments.

849
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But going back to this, he did a livestream with Neuralink, talking about playing chess, and also playing, Rob, you'll like this, Civ VI.

850
01:07:40,888 --> 01:07:41,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard about this.

851
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:42,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

852
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:45,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm playing just for eight hours.

853
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:47,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, just full disclosure.

854
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:58,755
[SPEAKER_05]: When I see Neuralink, I immediately roll my eyes because I know that it's a Elon Musk back thing and I just don't fucking like him and I don't intend to support anything that has his name attached to it.

855
01:07:58,755 --> 01:07:59,235
[SPEAKER_05]: However,

856
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:13,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a little, I will admit it's a little torn because I do like hearing about, Oh, there's these things that allow, you know, more accessibility to certain people and allow, you know, people to, you know, uh, experience things they have not been able to so far.

857
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:14,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a little torn.

858
01:08:14,692 --> 01:08:23,777
[SPEAKER_05]: My hope is that, you know, similar to, uh, the Tesla experience, uh, one company will do it and then other companies will do it, come in and do it even better.

859
01:08:23,777 --> 01:08:24,317
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my hope.

860
01:08:25,482 --> 01:08:28,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed intended not to bring up the ownership at all.

861
01:08:37,328 --> 01:08:39,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll save that for another thing.

862
01:08:39,009 --> 01:08:49,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but anyway, though, the fact that something like this is in existence and someone made it and someone is living a better life because of it, I think that's awesome.

863
01:08:49,094 --> 01:08:54,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that they're using it to play video games is honestly even more awesome.

864
01:08:54,277 --> 01:09:04,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the way that the chip works, it has like these different, uh, thread, thread-ish, like electrodes that go into parts of the brain that control movement.

865
01:09:04,203 --> 01:09:04,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

866
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:17,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it helps with responding on a computer, being able to control house automation, being able to use a keyboard.

867
01:09:17,381 --> 01:09:27,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that having bionic people now, or I guess kind of cybernetic people, is...

868
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:32,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to change a lot of lives in the future.

869
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:36,462
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to continue developing technology like this.

870
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also reading that they now have a bionic hand that can transmit actual sensation of feeling, if not like legit touch.

871
01:09:48,065 --> 01:09:49,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

872
01:09:49,925 --> 01:09:54,866
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, but still, you know, it just goes to show that

873
01:09:56,218 --> 01:10:03,927
[SPEAKER_02]: People, you know, no matter their ability level are going to want to play something and you open up that world to them, it gives them some joy.

874
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to remember that people going through various disabilities are people and they want to be happy and enjoy things just like the rest of us do.

875
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:20,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And Civ 6 is an excellent place to use those abilities, that's for sure.

876
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd imagine it would make things a lot easier.

877
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the kind of game that would lend itself best to something like that.

878
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:28,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

879
01:10:28,241 --> 01:10:40,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And reading this comment from Questbuster, if you don't care for Neuralink, other companies have been exploring BCI brain-computer interfaces for years, such as one in Australia where one of their patients used their approach to tweet in 2021.

880
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:42,564
[SPEAKER_05]: He has since been doing more with it since then.

881
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:55,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's and that's that's my whole thing is I'm like, okay, like, I'm not, I'm not gonna hate on this, because it's making, you know, again, things more accessible, you know, and what Jamie explained there is, is generally a good thing.

882
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:58,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't intend to support this particular company.

883
01:10:58,097 --> 01:11:03,302
[SPEAKER_05]: But I look at this as an industry of this is where other companies are going to go as well.

884
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:04,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway,

885
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on and talk about, unfortunately, one company that is going to no longer be able to do their thing.

886
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

887
01:11:15,491 --> 01:11:23,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, well, the Pokemon company, or Nintendo, is coming after a bunch of different fan-made things now.

888
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the first to be hit is Relic Castle, which is a popular forum based off of the creation and sharing of Pokemon fan games.

889
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:37,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has been taken down without warning.

890
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a post on Twitter put out by RelicCastle saying, Dear Pokemon fan community, it is with heavy heart that I have to announce that RelicCastle website has been taken down following a DMCA takedown notice.

891
01:11:53,004 --> 01:12:02,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And then apparently they're going to still have their Discord available for people as of right now.

892
01:12:02,948 --> 01:12:18,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, weirdly enough, the Pokemon Company has requested a takedown of a seven-year-old video featuring a modded Call of Duty zombies match where they've replaced the zombies with Pikachu.

893
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:20,596
[SPEAKER_04]: They've requested that that be taken down as well.

894
01:12:22,116 --> 01:12:30,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think I think back to the story about the lawyer last week that worked there and said, basically, he gets called attention to things when it comes across his desk.

895
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:35,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And I that I mean, I get that the seven years old thing makes for a great headline.

896
01:12:35,604 --> 01:12:39,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think, well, they just somebody finally shared it with them.

897
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:40,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody finally told them about it.

898
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:42,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how they that's how they ended up seeing it.

899
01:12:42,888 --> 01:12:43,128
[SPEAKER_05]: But I

900
01:12:44,329 --> 01:12:45,650
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the fucking point?

901
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I agree.

902
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:55,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also would kind of go, isn't there like kind of parody that could go into that as well that, you know, I don't think they exactly have the right to be doing that.

903
01:12:55,436 --> 01:12:59,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, when a large company threatens you, what are you going to do?

904
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:03,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And YouTube is not often sided with the creators, unfortunately.

905
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:04,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Talked about that before.

906
01:13:04,862 --> 01:13:09,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So but man, having this whole website, you know, closed.

907
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:13,368
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is, is this going to stop a single person from buying a Pokemon game?

908
01:13:14,586 --> 01:13:19,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, this community is still saying they're going to continue on Discord.

909
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:21,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to continue supporting all this stuff.

910
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:23,972
[SPEAKER_05]: So does this actually change anything?

911
01:13:25,555 --> 01:13:32,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just makes it a little harder to find, I guess they would have to, like, join the discord or something like that.

912
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:34,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not impossible.

913
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:34,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

914
01:13:34,923 --> 01:13:38,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also meant to change anything from either perspective.

915
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:39,006
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, does.

916
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:39,727
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

917
01:13:39,727 --> 01:13:40,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

918
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:46,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be basically the Pokemon is is people are going to look at it and go, wow, what a bunch of dicks.

919
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:48,014
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it really going to change anything?

920
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:53,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, it's not because all the games weren't actually hosted on this site.

921
01:13:53,025 --> 01:13:56,406
[SPEAKER_04]: They were linked out to other sites where they're hosted.

922
01:13:56,406 --> 01:13:59,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, yeah, just use the Wayback Machine.

923
01:13:59,007 --> 01:14:01,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like the site never went anywhere.

924
01:14:01,468 --> 01:14:03,628
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, bravo.

925
01:14:03,628 --> 01:14:04,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

926
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:05,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't do anything.

927
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:10,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this much though, this is my way of putting it succinctly.

928
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:22,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Stories like these, where the legal team is just shutting these things down for apparently no reason, and until they explain themselves, which they're never gonna do, it's apparently for no reason.

929
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:25,977
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why a lot of people out there

930
01:14:27,799 --> 01:14:35,086
[SPEAKER_05]: We're excited to play Palworld as something that completely wasn't even a game.

931
01:14:35,086 --> 01:14:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: People were willing to believe Palworld was something that it wasn't because everybody secretly wants these fucking legal teams and stuff to get theirs.

932
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:55,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think they also maybe want like innovation or they want something different with the Pokemon games because that's why they're playing these fan games.

933
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that they dislike Pokemon.

934
01:14:57,392 --> 01:15:00,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like they dislike or maybe they want more of

935
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:07,583
[SPEAKER_04]: the Pokemon games that they're making, or maybe they don't like the direction that they're taking those Pokemon games.

936
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:10,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're like, I don't know.

937
01:15:10,624 --> 01:15:18,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can say that the Pokemon games don't innovate because Pokemon Go is probably one of the most innovative video games of all time.

938
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,047
[SPEAKER_04]: How old is that now?

939
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:20,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on.

940
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:23,029
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm saying like Pokemon puts out a bunch of different products.

941
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:29,171
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what you really mean is from a technical perspective, the Nintendo commitment platform holds them back.

942
01:15:29,171 --> 01:15:29,831
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

943
01:15:31,172 --> 01:15:35,694
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get Pikachu in 4K because of the platforms that they're continuing to release on.

944
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:37,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

945
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:39,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

946
01:15:39,216 --> 01:15:39,596
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

947
01:15:39,596 --> 01:15:46,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if Pokemon isn't your thing, maybe Fortnite is kind of your thing.

948
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you know, Fortnite has been through a lot of changes in the last few months.

949
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:59,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I should say that there's new modes in it that make you realize that Fortnite is much more than Battle Royale, which is the game that everyone calls Fortnite.

950
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:09,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and that includes things like Lego Fortnite, which is, you know, a lot of people have been saying it's Minecraft, but it's also kind of a survival sort of game.

951
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I get not quite as much Minecraft vibes as I do dungeon quest build or dragon quest builders.

952
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that?

953
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,844
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Lego Fortnite feels like to me as dragon quest builders and that kind of like genre of games.

954
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:22,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do like Lego Fortnite.

955
01:16:22,886 --> 01:16:26,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, a lot of people like Lego Fortnite because it's still very popular.

956
01:16:26,689 --> 01:16:27,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And now this

957
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:32,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Game mode is going to be expanding and this was something that was announced at GDC.

958
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:42,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't often get a lot of gaming news, but because this is about creating worlds and creating experiences in Fortnite, it fit the bill of something to promote at GDC.

959
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:51,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So during Epic Unreal's keynote on March 20th, they were talking about Fortnite and Unreal and talked about how both were going to be evolving in the future.

960
01:16:52,365 --> 01:17:07,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And Epic is going to be adding tools and features to let anyone create their own big or small Lego adventures and share them online in Fortnite on all of the platforms that Fortnite is on, which is pretty much everything.

961
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,323
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be starting on Tuesday.

962
01:17:11,095 --> 01:17:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Lego tools, templates, assets, they're in Fortnite's creative mode, and Unreal Editor for Fortnite or UEFN, which is the more advanced software to create these things in.

963
01:17:23,775 --> 01:17:38,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Logo Designed Islands will follow all the same rules as other user-generated content, but there are some additional rules and restrictions, because LEGO is mandating all published LEGO islands must have an ESRB rating of E10+, or lower, because it's got to be kid-friendly.

964
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:47,442
[SPEAKER_05]: The LEGO Group is also going to take a cut of money that you make through this, so you agree to share 15% of your total island payout with the LEGO Group.

965
01:17:47,922 --> 01:17:49,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's something to consider there.

966
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:54,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm I'm sure there's folks that will go do their thing.

967
01:17:54,183 --> 01:18:00,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe Lego kind of announced it's like a proof of concept sort of thing of this.

968
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:05,165
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new Cat Island, a logo or logo Lego Cat Island that's available.

969
01:18:05,165 --> 01:18:08,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a different level where you go in and you play with cats.

970
01:18:08,306 --> 01:18:11,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And as somebody who likes Legos and likes cats.

971
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:12,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this speaks to me.

972
01:18:12,586 --> 01:18:13,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to try this mode.

973
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:15,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine Loki has got to be sitting there going,

974
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:19,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to try that if I can put Minecraft down for a minute.

975
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:24,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, yeah, I'll have to check that out this week at some point.

976
01:18:24,975 --> 01:18:27,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's continuing to expand.

977
01:18:27,697 --> 01:18:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So very, very interesting.

978
01:18:29,118 --> 01:18:30,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I've talked about this before.

979
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:31,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't repeat myself too much.

980
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But Fortnite is not a game.

981
01:18:34,122 --> 01:18:35,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortnite is now a platform.

982
01:18:35,964 --> 01:18:39,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very interesting to see this stuff continue to expand.

983
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:39,567
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

984
01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:48,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny because like, you know, Roblox, it's, I think that started off as like a Lego game, Lego inspired game.

985
01:18:48,282 --> 01:18:54,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, and now it's basically, it's like Lego type characters making, you know, obstacle courses and stuff.

986
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:58,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sure enough, this, this video that they're talking about, Hey, start building your own Lego islands.

987
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing that, Hey, you can make obstacle courses or Hey, we like to be cool.

988
01:19:02,633 --> 01:19:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the kids, we're going to call them Obbies.

989
01:19:04,594 --> 01:19:06,496
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make Obbies.

990
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,897
[SPEAKER_04]: We speak in the language kids.

991
01:19:08,437 --> 01:19:10,179
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S

992
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:43,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Lael, did you ever play a lot of the shinobi games especially that came out later like on Saturn?

993
01:19:43,822 --> 01:19:45,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Only the old school arcade games.

994
01:19:45,802 --> 01:19:47,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I never played the Saturn ones to be honest.

995
01:19:49,371 --> 01:20:01,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Shinobi Legions, also known in Japan as Shin Shinobi Den, and in Europe as Shinobi X, because everything had an X in the name.

996
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:12,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Whale, there is a cheat code in Shinobi Legions discovered by Beau Bales, the Saturn hacker, that has a debug mode.

997
01:20:12,632 --> 01:20:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It activates a debug.

998
01:20:14,253 --> 01:20:19,417
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's gonna require 40 buttons to make this happen.

999
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:35,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So the steps to do it require, get ready, go to the options screen, navigate to music, select stage 2-3, navigate to sound effect and select 0-6.

1000
01:20:35,347 --> 01:20:40,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Navigate to audio and hold L while putting in this 40 button sequence.

1001
01:20:41,647 --> 01:20:56,424
[SPEAKER_02]: A button 10 times, X once, B 3, Y once, C 6, Z once, X 10 times, A once, Y 3 times, B once, Z 6 times, C once.

1002
01:20:56,424 --> 01:20:58,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Exit the options screen and start a new game.

1003
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:01,830
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did it correctly, you can press the R button to bring up a menu.

1004
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:07,492
[SPEAKER_02]: with Level Select to change your lives and continues, boost your life bar, all kinds of stuff.

1005
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:14,334
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to hold L, R, and Z to move the protagonist freely without collision.

1006
01:21:14,334 --> 01:21:27,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... So yeah, it will, um... There's a patch out there too that if you, uh, like, select a button, it'll just automatically activate the debug mode.

1007
01:21:27,718 --> 01:21:30,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um... There you go.

1008
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:31,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a...

1009
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:33,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there!

1010
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:40,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know how to do it for real without any external stuff, but apparently, so I made it easy.

1011
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:41,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1012
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:45,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to see if Kotaku had written a guide yet on how to unlock the debug mode in Shinobi Legions.

1013
01:21:45,912 --> 01:21:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't- they don't have one yet!

1014
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:52,494
[SPEAKER_05]: They're- they're by- Kotaku, that's not how you're gonna win!

1015
01:21:52,494 --> 01:21:53,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sayin'.

1016
01:21:53,714 --> 01:21:54,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1017
01:21:54,754 --> 01:21:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't you on top of the Shin-Shinobi Den stuff, huh, huh, huh, huh?

1018
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:09,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but still, in all seriousness, always love these stories about discovering like old things or excuse me, new things and old games is really cool, especially the one.

1019
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,041
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the one a few weeks ago?

1020
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:19,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like you could completely like put the PlayStation into like debug mode and flip the disc out and all this stuff was buried in like an old alien game that was on PlayStation.

1021
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:20,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so cool.

1022
01:22:20,829 --> 01:22:22,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I like that a lot of this stuff kind of gets found.

1023
01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:27,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, a lot of this is from I think some people like go so far as to like decompile the games and find this stuff.

1024
01:22:27,914 --> 01:22:28,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But

1025
01:22:30,255 --> 01:22:45,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually watching someone today, I'll have to find the video again, where he had to completely reverse engineer a code key thing for a game that no longer had the box.

1026
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,805
[SPEAKER_02]: that isn't being supported anymore, so there's no way to get a new code to play the game.

1027
01:22:51,805 --> 01:23:04,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And he created some script that lets you go into how the authenticator on it works, and the numbers that it checks for, and what you have to have in order to make it work.

1028
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:06,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty amazing.

1029
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a little bit was over over my head.

1030
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:13,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little better at following now that I'm starting some coding.

1031
01:23:13,124 --> 01:23:20,429
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it was kind of kind of neat what people are doing so they can play their old games again, too.

1032
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:21,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1033
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:25,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on a few more stories before we get to another classic game in our regular segment.

1034
01:23:25,852 --> 01:23:27,834
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we're going to go over to Loki.

1035
01:23:28,686 --> 01:23:43,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is not great, but apparently Bloomberg is saying that Sony has paused production on the PlayStation VR 2 because it's produced 2 million units and is having trouble selling them.

1036
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:51,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Sales are declining each quarter according to the International Data Corporation and, you know,

1037
01:23:53,362 --> 01:24:00,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, obviously it's because it's expensive and it also requires you to buy a PlayStation 5 which is also expensive.

1038
01:24:00,593 --> 01:24:04,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you don't have the must-have games on PlayStation VR.

1039
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:13,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And so why make the over $1,000 investment to play some games in VR?

1040
01:24:13,812 --> 01:24:30,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, though, they're going to be supporting PC very soon, because I did see there is an article talking about how Sony has enabled NVIDIA support for the PlayStation VR 2 using the DP auxiliary emulator and a modified EDID.

1041
01:24:30,606 --> 01:24:34,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell that means, but it sounds like that they're working on

1042
01:24:35,530 --> 01:25:02,336
[SPEAKER_05]: getting PC support to work someone which is legit a great idea they could save this hardware is getting it to run with PCs as well because unfortunately the must have utility doesn't exist on PlayStation and it seems very clear it's not coming so that's you know I'm surprised it took this long for this story to come to kind of come down the pipeline where they're they're having to scale back how much they're making this because there's there's not a lot of reason to buy one currently

1043
01:25:02,776 --> 01:25:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1044
01:25:03,276 --> 01:25:13,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you're either buying one to play stuff they already announced some time ago and released, so maybe... But otherwise, you know, what's Sony doing now for this device?

1045
01:25:13,922 --> 01:25:18,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a hard... It's starting to feel like yet another Sony abandoned piece of hardware.

1046
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:23,088
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, happy birthday to the PSP, which was released 19 years ago.

1047
01:25:23,088 --> 01:25:31,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hard sell just because, like, I like the PlayStation VR, or at least I like playing the games on it, but yeah, it's...

1048
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:42,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard making that that sell now for these games considering that there's not really that many exclusives and the ones that are like playable on multiple platforms.

1049
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:46,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play that on a cheaper device.

1050
01:25:46,066 --> 01:25:46,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just

1051
01:25:47,728 --> 01:25:52,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if it's that can it could be that night and day different as far as quality goes.

1052
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:57,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, am I going to get a better gameplay experience on the PlayStation VR 2?

1053
01:25:57,053 --> 01:26:00,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's the case, but yeah, it's it's a tough sell right now.

1054
01:26:00,475 --> 01:26:06,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also sucks that it doesn't play original PlayStation VR games, which kind of hobbled this thing.

1055
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:06,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1056
01:26:06,819 --> 01:26:08,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand before y'all.

1057
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct me and explain it to me.

1058
01:26:10,362 --> 01:26:18,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why it doesn't play the original because of the complete change in the way that it senses the environment around you and all that.

1059
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:22,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But that just goes to show the original decision wasn't very future proofed.

1060
01:26:24,077 --> 01:26:40,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just kind of sucks that, you know, the original library isn't playable, which, again, even the great software that's out there for original PlayStation VR doesn't really work with VR 2 unless the developers, like, you know, which they did with No Man's Sky and a few other games, actually upgraded it.

1061
01:26:40,846 --> 01:26:44,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby in chat says, I love the PSVR 2 hardware.

1062
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It just has no software.

1063
01:26:46,091 --> 01:26:47,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.

1064
01:26:47,132 --> 01:26:57,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I remember going to your house and checking out PSVR 2, which if I'm not mistaking on your show tonight said was probably the last time you actually used that thing.

1065
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:58,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one time since.

1066
01:26:59,944 --> 01:27:04,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But in all seriousness, yeah, I enjoyed the the I keep calling it a demo.

1067
01:27:04,907 --> 01:27:06,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think it was like a full game.

1068
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:10,090
[SPEAKER_05]: The Horizon demo, the old proof of concept thing that we were playing.

1069
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:11,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was neat.

1070
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:20,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it just it was no like must have killer thing for VR and like Beat Saber's kind of lived its life at this point.

1071
01:27:20,556 --> 01:27:22,277
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what's what's next?

1072
01:27:22,277 --> 01:27:25,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Show us that compelling future for VR in gaming.

1073
01:27:28,257 --> 01:27:31,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life Alyx, but Half-Life Alyx is kind of limited to one thing.

1074
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:36,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think yeah, so it's just, I don't know.

1075
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:43,141
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, as Joan Hunter Matt says, then need that PC update to help supplement them until they get those PSVR 2 games out.

1076
01:27:43,141 --> 01:27:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby says, I do believe that if I could use my PSVR 2 on my PC, the games would look better than they do on my Valve Index.

1077
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:53,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And the PSVR 2 is technically cheaper than a Valve Index.

1078
01:27:54,099 --> 01:27:54,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent point.

1079
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:55,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be cool.

1080
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:56,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it really would.

1081
01:27:56,841 --> 01:28:01,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So that does seem to be kind of the hardware saving direction for this product.

1082
01:28:01,564 --> 01:28:12,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might even make me interested in one, to be quite honest, because the fact that I could have something that could play PC stuff and work on PlayStation is actually kind of like, oh, OK, now we're talking.

1083
01:28:12,151 --> 01:28:12,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1084
01:28:12,611 --> 01:28:15,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what happens.

1085
01:28:15,413 --> 01:28:16,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, in the meantime,

1086
01:28:17,273 --> 01:28:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about Street Fighter 6.

1087
01:28:20,214 --> 01:28:22,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a game I believe is played in VR at all.

1088
01:28:22,995 --> 01:28:24,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But Street Fighter 6 is still going.

1089
01:28:24,895 --> 01:28:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's been out for a little bit, but we are now talking about rumors and leaks for Season 2 DLC.

1090
01:28:34,117 --> 01:28:40,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, the leaker who accurately leaked the entire Street Fighter 6 roster before it was revealed.

1091
01:28:40,419 --> 01:28:41,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when that was a big issue?

1092
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:43,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom not happy about that.

1093
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,260
[SPEAKER_05]: M Bison VEGA

1094
01:29:11,398 --> 01:29:26,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other characters, maybe not from Street Fighter 2, but some people will still be happy to hear about, R. Mika, or Rainbow Mika, who is a pro wrestler in Street Fighter Alpha 3, and then got a redesign in Street Fighter 5, also rumored to be a part of this pack.

1095
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:33,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, also, we have Sakura, which I'm sure will make our very own DarkSakura happy.

1096
01:29:33,591 --> 01:29:36,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Sakura, of course, debuted in Street Fighter 2 Alpha.

1097
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:40,075
[SPEAKER_05]: and Elena also for this pack.

1098
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:41,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Elena's fun.

1099
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:42,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1100
01:29:42,116 --> 01:29:43,917
[SPEAKER_05]: She was from Street Fighter 3.

1101
01:29:43,917 --> 01:29:44,658
[SPEAKER_05]: You were not already.

1102
01:29:44,658 --> 01:29:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the leggy girl.

1103
01:29:45,759 --> 01:29:46,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1104
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:50,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sixth character is supposed to be a brand new character.

1105
01:29:50,182 --> 01:29:52,843
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no name provided as of yet.

1106
01:29:52,843 --> 01:29:56,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So just that the sixth character is not going to be one that you actually know.

1107
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody that's going to be brand new.

1108
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:00,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1109
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:05,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf says the day that M. Bison graced the new Street Fighter was the greatest day of your life.

1110
01:30:05,912 --> 01:30:07,133
[SPEAKER_05]: But for him, it was a Tuesday.

1111
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:15,058
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, while we're talking about old games, I think it's a great time to segue into our next segment.

1112
01:30:15,058 --> 01:30:15,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.

1113
01:30:45,126 --> 01:30:52,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1114
01:30:52,873 --> 01:30:56,055
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1115
01:30:56,055 --> 01:30:58,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for us this week?

1116
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:03,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked a game called The Dungeon Revealed.

1117
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And any old Mac gamer should know this one.

1118
01:31:10,445 --> 01:31:17,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a dungeon crawl game that was created by John Raymonds and published by Woodrow's Editions in 1987.

1119
01:31:17,631 --> 01:31:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the enhanced commercial release of another game that Raymonds played called The Dungeon of Doom that came out of Shareware in 1985.

1120
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:34,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some more about this.

1121
01:31:34,283 --> 01:31:41,589
[SPEAKER_02]: The games were released for Mac OS and were compatible all the way up to System 7.

1122
01:31:41,589 --> 01:31:46,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe that the video that us here live are watching is a System 6 version.

1123
01:31:46,553 --> 01:31:51,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So at any rate, you have a character that is trapped in a dungeon underground.

1124
01:31:52,839 --> 01:32:01,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you attempt to take stairs from the dungeon, you get a message that says, a force prevents you from escaping to the surface.

1125
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:06,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the orb will set you free.

1126
01:32:06,055 --> 01:32:07,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a...

1127
01:32:09,018 --> 01:32:11,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of vague, isn't it?

1128
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:22,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at any rate, you have 40 floors, and each of them have a staircase going up and a staircase going down.

1129
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:24,529
[SPEAKER_02]: The floor plan is randomly generated.

1130
01:32:25,429 --> 01:32:33,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And through each of those levels it gets to be more and more complicated to navigate through it, very maze-like.

1131
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:40,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You also can find some armor and magic accoutrements, potions, wands, weapons.

1132
01:32:41,218 --> 01:32:47,622
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of stuff that you find through the dungeons, little areas that you're searching through.

1133
01:32:47,622 --> 01:32:57,068
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have monsters, depending on their circumstances, they can also be more aggro or less aggro.

1134
01:32:57,068 --> 01:33:02,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to eat, so that you don't starve to death.

1135
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, as you go further and further, the monsters become stronger and stronger.

1136
01:33:09,776 --> 01:33:16,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have, when you start your game, you can pick one of seven classes.

1137
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:18,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You might laugh as much as I did the last one.

1138
01:33:18,282 --> 01:33:20,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I even laughed when it was new.

1139
01:33:20,723 --> 01:33:25,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Knight, Fighter, Sage, Wizard, Alchemist, Jeweler, and Jones!

1140
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a Jones.

1141
01:33:28,288 --> 01:33:35,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has their own attributes, very D&D-like in how they're assigned.

1142
01:33:38,164 --> 01:33:53,672
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as each of these other ones, they all have this ability to access one type of object.

1143
01:33:53,672 --> 01:34:00,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an alchemist can identify potions, so they can avoid the poison.

1144
01:34:00,035 --> 01:34:03,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Wizards can have wands, stuff like that.

1145
01:34:08,288 --> 01:34:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jones... I'm trying to see if I can find what it was The Jones did.

1146
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:22,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they're just the standard, but it's been a moment, I'll have to look them up.

1147
01:34:22,831 --> 01:34:36,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate, each class has a different kind of likelihood to find a certain kind of item, and you improve your ability scores as you go along, very D&D-like.

1148
01:34:39,452 --> 01:34:48,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But, as far as the original game, Dungeon of Doom... Yeah, don't shoot food orange, right?

1149
01:34:48,717 --> 01:34:58,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically John Raymond made the game to teach himself C, and because he did not like the Mac port of Ultima II.

1150
01:34:58,102 --> 01:35:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I kinda like this game, I'm gonna make my own.

1151
01:35:00,003 --> 01:35:00,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye!

1152
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:15,614
[SPEAKER_02]: and he released it anyway as Shareware in 1985 but had no payments really by 1987 even though it had become one of the most popular games on the Mac at the time.

1153
01:35:15,614 --> 01:35:30,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So he said, well, screw that and upgraded the game and decided to have it published by Woodrow's Editions in 87 and retitled it The Dungeon Revealed.

1154
01:35:32,024 --> 01:35:46,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The gameplay was pretty much the same, but the enhancements had some new sounds, hidden vaults, gatekeepers at the stairs, new items, and then he also put the source code out there that could be purchased by registered buyers.

1155
01:35:46,411 --> 01:35:53,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also did a final version of the Dungeon of Doom that basically

1156
01:35:54,295 --> 01:36:05,438
[SPEAKER_02]: changed none of the code since version 4 was out, but reclassified this as a free demo for the dungeon revealed.

1157
01:36:05,438 --> 01:36:16,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Macworld had inducted Dungeon of Doom into the 1987 Macworld Game Hall of Fame in the Roleplay Game category.

1158
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,041
[SPEAKER_02]: The runner-up to this was The Seven Cities of Gold.

1159
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:31,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also named Dungeon of Doom as the best implementation of Rogue in 2D maze game in its Shareware and Public Domain Game Awards the same year.

1160
01:36:31,228 --> 01:36:38,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Mac user rated the game a 4 out of 5, calling it a standard adventure in the Ultima series genre.

1161
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:42,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go, I mean, it's black and white, you know.

1162
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:46,623
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what our games were like on the Mac back then.

1163
01:37:00,151 --> 01:37:09,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I didn't have a Mac as a kid or, you know, in the 80s, we had one at school.

1164
01:37:09,617 --> 01:37:24,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember people sneaking this game onto that computer, you know, and, you know, my friends playing this game, my friends who had more money than me.

1165
01:37:24,325 --> 01:37:29,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely, I didn't remember the,

1166
01:37:30,402 --> 01:37:36,825
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw the Jones thing listed again, I was like, oh, I kind of remember that, but I still don't remember what they do.

1167
01:37:36,825 --> 01:37:42,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't listed here and just like, I get to be a Jones.

1168
01:37:42,347 --> 01:37:43,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, QuestBuster.

1169
01:37:43,428 --> 01:37:45,569
[SPEAKER_02]: My daddy was a Jones.

1170
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:52,792
[SPEAKER_05]: QuestBuster comments on this game saying the simple fun or it's simple fun that still holds up, especially if you're something of a roguelike fan.

1171
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:54,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely big rogue vibes off this game.

1172
01:37:55,373 --> 01:37:55,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystal Quest?

1173
01:37:55,993 --> 01:37:56,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystal Quest?

1174
01:37:56,393 --> 01:37:56,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystal Quest?

1175
01:38:24,005 --> 01:38:28,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Crystal Maze, that was a TV show.

1176
01:38:28,128 --> 01:38:28,929
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Crystal Quest.

1177
01:38:28,929 --> 01:38:32,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out on the Apple IIe before.

1178
01:38:32,171 --> 01:38:34,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's been a Game Boy version, too.

1179
01:38:34,473 --> 01:38:36,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1180
01:38:36,174 --> 01:38:38,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember the Mac one, to be honest.

1181
01:38:38,075 --> 01:38:39,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1182
01:38:39,556 --> 01:38:39,777
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1183
01:38:39,777 --> 01:38:41,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway.

1184
01:38:41,318 --> 01:38:46,401
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1185
01:38:46,401 --> 01:38:47,822
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dungeon Revealed.

1186
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:50,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Crystal Quest will get its time in the future.

1187
01:38:50,865 --> 01:38:51,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1188
01:38:52,062 --> 01:38:55,064
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we still have some headlines to get to.

1189
01:38:55,064 --> 01:38:58,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's do some rapid fire news.

1190
01:38:58,066 --> 01:39:01,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll start with Loki.

1191
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:07,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Spokesperson for Larian Studios has said that, hey, we're done with Baldur's Gate 3.

1192
01:39:07,472 --> 01:39:09,994
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not developing anymore for it.

1193
01:39:09,994 --> 01:39:13,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're moving on from Baldur's Gate and Dungeons and Dragons.

1194
01:39:13,256 --> 01:39:18,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be working on a new IP.

1195
01:39:18,279 --> 01:39:20,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know what it is, but it's not going to be Baldur's Gate.

1196
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:25,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly good for them being able to make a power move like that at this point.

1197
01:39:25,294 --> 01:39:36,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So many studios kind of get stuck into doing sequel upon sequel and, you know, Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the most award winningest games there's been in quite some time and I love that they can just be like, you know what?

1198
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to go do something new.

1199
01:39:39,326 --> 01:39:40,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, fair enough.

1200
01:39:40,546 --> 01:39:41,667
[SPEAKER_04]: They should.

1201
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:49,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have the release date now for the Final Fantasy 14's final DLC.

1202
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:52,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it 16?

1203
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:52,170
[SPEAKER_04]: 16.

1204
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:53,351
[SPEAKER_04]: 16, my mistake.

1205
01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:55,372
[SPEAKER_04]: 16's final DLC.

1206
01:39:55,372 --> 01:39:59,773
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to be Rising Tide.

1207
01:39:59,773 --> 01:40:04,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to unravel the mystery behind the icon of water.

1208
01:40:05,126 --> 01:40:05,966
[SPEAKER_04]: April 18 Expansion Pass

1209
01:40:19,425 --> 01:40:26,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I will just quickly mention, since you brought up Final Fantasy XIV, they released a lot of info on that at PAX East this weekend.

1210
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:28,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dawn Trail has a date.

1211
01:40:28,269 --> 01:40:33,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be playable on June 28th if you pre-order it, which most fans of the game are going to do that.

1212
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:38,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know why they bothered to have two release dates, but June 28th will be the date for most people.

1213
01:40:38,873 --> 01:40:44,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks to be very heavily Final Fantasy IX inspired based on the pre-order bonuses and those sorts of things.

1214
01:40:44,575 --> 01:40:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not quite sure how yet.

1215
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:52,800
[SPEAKER_05]: But then also related to this, Loki, the Final Fantasy XVI x XIV event.

1216
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So the XVI event in XIV.

1217
01:40:55,041 --> 01:40:58,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's the thing is going to be it looks like next month.

1218
01:40:58,163 --> 01:40:59,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So in April, that'll be fun.

1219
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:10,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's up with the whole like double currency thing with the Xbox version that you can buy like a special current coin in order to pay for your services, which is stupid.

1220
01:41:10,363 --> 01:41:11,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's weird.

1221
01:41:11,664 --> 01:41:14,785
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Xbox version officially released this week.

1222
01:41:14,785 --> 01:41:24,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the only way you can pay for your subscription on Xbox, if you only have an Xbox license, is to use these Xbox coins that you buy through the store.

1223
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:28,792
[SPEAKER_05]: which is essentially Microsoft getting a cut of that one way or another.

1224
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:41,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure the why behind it because it definitely kind of looks silly when it's put side by side with the PS4 and 5 version and the PC version why you have this, but you know, it's going to enable some people to play the game that haven't been able to before.

1225
01:41:42,744 --> 01:41:55,897
[SPEAKER_05]: An interesting point I saw raised elsewhere is that in some territories, certain ones in South America, Central America, this will make Final Fantasy XIV more affordable than it is today.

1226
01:41:55,897 --> 01:41:59,000
[SPEAKER_05]: But meanwhile, most people in the US, Europe, etc.

1227
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,306
[SPEAKER_05]: are kind of razzing the team because you have to have an Xbox Game Pass account

1228
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:06,627
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

1229
01:42:27,324 --> 01:42:29,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go to that edition.

1230
01:42:29,665 --> 01:42:32,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Use the free edition to see if you like the game.

1231
01:42:32,627 --> 01:42:42,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you decide you like the game and you want the restrictions to move, then go to the starter edition, because otherwise you're missing out on being able to play a good chunk of the game for free.

1232
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:48,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I think this is a really silly and a lot of people are like, what the hell are they doing with Final Fantasy on Xbox?

1233
01:42:48,756 --> 01:42:54,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a little ridiculous, but if it gets even a handful of new people into the game, then cool, I guess.

1234
01:42:54,579 --> 01:42:55,720
[SPEAKER_05]: But was it worth the effort?

1235
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I can't imagine it was much.

1236
01:42:58,302 --> 01:43:02,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the game already runs on PCs very well.

1237
01:43:02,405 --> 01:43:09,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like when you put an Xbox controller in the PC, it has all the Xbox labelings anyway.

1238
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:10,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1239
01:43:10,911 --> 01:43:11,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1240
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:11,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1241
01:43:11,972 --> 01:43:12,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1242
01:43:12,332 --> 01:43:13,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1243
01:43:13,132 --> 01:43:13,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1244
01:43:13,493 --> 01:43:14,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1245
01:43:14,033 --> 01:43:17,235
[SPEAKER_05]: A little diversion there, but I noticed it was nowhere else in the show.

1246
01:43:17,235 --> 01:43:18,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I'd bring it up.

1247
01:43:18,797 --> 01:43:19,177
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1248
01:43:21,335 --> 01:43:30,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a game that I certainly love is going to be coming out for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 9th.

1249
01:43:30,409 --> 01:43:31,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rainbow Cotton.

1250
01:43:32,631 --> 01:43:43,123
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the, I would say the successor to Panorama Cotton, the rare one for the Mega Drive slash Genesis.

1251
01:43:43,123 --> 01:43:50,110
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a remake of the one that came out for Dreamcast, which was released on January 20th, 2000 in Japan.

1252
01:43:52,112 --> 01:43:57,678
[SPEAKER_02]: never got an American release.

1253
01:43:57,678 --> 01:44:03,465
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play the original Dreamcast version or you can play an enhanced version.

1254
01:44:03,465 --> 01:44:09,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It will have a rumble and speaker support for your controllers.

1255
01:44:09,231 --> 01:44:11,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Cotton will be, of course, in full glorious 3D.

1256
01:44:13,095 --> 01:44:18,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a little sibling mode where you can play as Cotton and Silk together.

1257
01:44:18,736 --> 01:44:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Silk usually floats around with her.

1258
01:44:20,937 --> 01:44:23,698
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little fairy friend.

1259
01:44:23,698 --> 01:44:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can actually play as Silk.

1260
01:44:26,859 --> 01:44:35,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And then not only can you listen to the original Japanese with subtitles,

1261
01:44:38,709 --> 01:44:44,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They will also have subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and German.

1262
01:44:53,857 --> 01:44:58,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complete remaster.

1263
01:44:58,579 --> 01:44:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going to be pretty.

1264
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It has all the stuff in it.

1265
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:10,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also, though, have, like I said, you can play the original one and that one is emulated to be exactly like it was.

1266
01:45:10,645 --> 01:45:11,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1267
01:45:11,286 --> 01:45:11,546
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1268
01:45:12,026 --> 01:45:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this game.

1269
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:19,629
[SPEAKER_02]: We imported this the moment I heard it was coming out, because it was the only way I could get something like panorama cotton at the time.

1270
01:45:19,629 --> 01:45:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's adorable.

1271
01:45:22,169 --> 01:45:30,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I love the bonus rounds are still the same as they were in the other cotton games where you have to collect tea, tea cups.

1272
01:45:30,752 --> 01:45:33,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And she goes, hello.

1273
01:45:33,513 --> 01:45:37,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, subjugates fairies to do her bidding.

1274
01:45:37,094 --> 01:45:39,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't like to subjugate a fairy to do their bidding?

1275
01:45:40,811 --> 01:45:42,532
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sounds like a fun Friday night.

1276
01:45:42,532 --> 01:45:42,872
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1277
01:45:42,872 --> 01:45:47,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's talk about a follow up to something from last week's show.

1278
01:45:47,595 --> 01:45:51,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We were joking about Team 0% and their journey on Super Mario Maker.

1279
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:58,982
[SPEAKER_05]: They may have to call themselves Team 0.001% because there's this one level they weren't able to beat.

1280
01:45:58,982 --> 01:45:59,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1281
01:45:59,783 --> 01:46:01,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they beat the level this week?

1282
01:46:02,188 --> 01:46:06,411
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but they're claiming victory anyway because of a technicality.

1283
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:22,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, the one level that they were still unable to beat called Trimming the Herbs, you might remember that was the level they were trying to beat after time and time and time again, it was revealed this week that the creator had cheated and was able to upload the game to the server

1284
01:46:22,962 --> 01:46:26,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though they hadn't actually beaten the level themselves.

1285
01:46:26,865 --> 01:46:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So the level was confirmed to be a fake.

1286
01:46:30,747 --> 01:46:40,174
[SPEAKER_05]: The level's creator owned up, Ahoyo was the level's creator's name, owned up to the fact that it was an illegitimate level and somehow was still able to be uploaded to the servers.

1287
01:46:40,174 --> 01:46:41,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And they basically talk about that it was

1288
01:46:42,861 --> 01:46:47,365
[SPEAKER_05]: ToolAssisted, or I don't know how they did it, but they cheated to get the level on the server.

1289
01:46:47,365 --> 01:46:49,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that.

1290
01:46:49,948 --> 01:46:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: But so this thing has been sitting on the server since 2017.

1291
01:46:55,573 --> 01:46:59,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So no idea why it wasn't flagged sooner.

1292
01:46:59,216 --> 01:47:06,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so now because it has been officially unveiled that this level was a fraud,

1293
01:47:06,763 --> 01:47:06,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

1294
01:47:35,504 --> 01:47:37,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that they should have still beaten it.

1295
01:47:37,848 --> 01:47:42,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but, but, but they should have beat it with a TAS.

1296
01:47:42,314 --> 01:47:43,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like, you know, just.

1297
01:47:45,174 --> 01:47:46,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight fire with fire.

1298
01:48:10,225 --> 01:48:14,087
[SPEAKER_05]: granted it's seven years later, but maybe they've done a lot of growing up in seven years.

1299
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:16,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I feel like I have too.

1300
01:48:16,329 --> 01:48:21,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know, maybe they saw that this was in the news and they came clean on this.

1301
01:48:21,352 --> 01:48:24,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll at least say hey, glad they did that.

1302
01:48:24,674 --> 01:48:32,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So these folks that were working so hard to get the 0% could feel good about the fact that they actually did do it.

1303
01:48:32,599 --> 01:48:32,939
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1304
01:48:33,579 --> 01:48:46,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are coming out a little sooner to hopefully replace the hole that Mario Maker Wii U might be leaving in your heart.

1305
01:48:46,234 --> 01:48:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's start with the US.

1306
01:48:47,878 --> 01:48:49,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a few things.

1307
01:48:49,559 --> 01:48:54,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting off on PC, we have Boomer Road.

1308
01:48:54,161 --> 01:48:58,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Not A Lot, which is a robot game.

1309
01:48:58,924 --> 01:49:16,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my favorite of these three games, Doronko Wanko, which is a game where you play as a Pomeranian and you imagine Splatoon, but with a Pomeranian and you're trying to mess up a house and make it as dirty as possible.

1310
01:49:16,393 --> 01:49:16,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds fun.

1311
01:49:17,512 --> 01:49:22,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I take the wanko would be like the one one you know like the bark sound that a dog makes in Japanese.

1312
01:49:23,628 --> 01:49:28,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly, but it looks adorable and now I have to wishlist it because it is on Steam.

1313
01:49:28,732 --> 01:49:30,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are coming out this week.

1314
01:49:30,133 --> 01:49:39,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Bulwark Falconeer Chronicles on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1315
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:44,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Grandia HD Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1316
01:49:44,324 --> 01:49:47,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Zoo on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1317
01:49:49,042 --> 01:49:59,129
[SPEAKER_04]: South Park Snow Day on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Amiro Chocolate on Nintendo Switch

1318
01:50:00,194 --> 01:50:22,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Mars2120 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series OpenRoads on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Peppergrinder on PC and Nintendo Switch We've got, let's see...

1319
01:50:27,248 --> 01:50:31,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Chia, Tachia on PC and that's it.

1320
01:50:34,821 --> 01:50:38,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I was muted for a minute there, but I'm now obsessed with this trailer for this.

1321
01:50:38,982 --> 01:50:39,562
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

1322
01:50:39,562 --> 01:50:45,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Duranco Wonko, where yes, we're watching the little dog and sorry, sorry to those that are on the podcast feed, but you can look up the trailer.

1323
01:50:45,744 --> 01:50:51,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on YouTube where we're watching this itty bitty cute little Pomeranian dog just fuck up this entire house.

1324
01:50:51,826 --> 01:50:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a Pomeranian, though.

1325
01:50:53,787 --> 01:50:55,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of need to play.

1326
01:50:55,467 --> 01:50:58,408
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what Nintendogs should have been, to be quite honest.

1327
01:50:59,368 --> 01:51:01,288
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan, on the 26th, South Park Snow Day.

1328
01:51:01,288 --> 01:51:04,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the Nintendo Switch, on the 28th, Radirigi 2.

1329
01:51:26,595 --> 01:51:30,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Regular and Limited Edition Prominstar Winning Post 10 2024

1330
01:51:44,775 --> 01:51:57,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Mirochocolate is also out in Japan this week, and let's see, Muv Luv also gets a 20th Odyssey limited edition multi-language box.

1331
01:51:57,642 --> 01:52:01,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost positive this game has come out before, so I'm thinking this is some type of box.

1332
01:52:01,184 --> 01:52:05,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's Muv Luv and Muv Luv Alternative, so it's a couple games all in one.

1333
01:52:05,107 --> 01:52:08,248
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have Aquarium coming out in Japan on the 28th.

1334
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:14,654
[SPEAKER_05]: and let's look at the PlayStation 5 real quick and see what releases are there.

1335
01:52:14,654 --> 01:52:19,739
[SPEAKER_05]: As expected, the South Park Snow Day is out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 5.

1336
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:24,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Ratatouille 2 is out there as well as Winning Post 10 2024.

1337
01:52:24,584 --> 01:52:25,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

1338
01:52:25,965 --> 01:52:28,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else I mentioned is only for Switch.

1339
01:52:28,888 --> 01:52:29,749
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

1340
01:52:31,425 --> 01:52:32,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a handful of things.

1341
01:52:32,785 --> 01:52:37,967
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 26th for the main four, we have South Park Snow Day.

1342
01:52:37,967 --> 01:52:46,129
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 28th, we have on Switch, we have World War Z or World War Zed.

1343
01:52:46,129 --> 01:52:50,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the 28th for Switch, Outward Definitive Edition.

1344
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:53,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on PlayStation Switch on the 29th, we have Pocket Bravery.

1345
01:52:56,011 --> 01:53:03,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we have a few more news stories for you and then we'll see if you all have any questions for us as if we haven't taken enough tangents tonight.

1346
01:53:03,476 --> 01:53:06,538
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's the problem with a few more?

1347
01:53:06,538 --> 01:53:09,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll go over to Loki with another headline.

1348
01:53:10,151 --> 01:53:12,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently.

1349
01:53:12,392 --> 01:53:20,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's I think it's been reported anonymously because they haven't said it yet from Rockstar Games.

1350
01:53:20,534 --> 01:53:29,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But allegedly there is rumors that Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be delayed into 2026.

1351
01:53:29,097 --> 01:53:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason for that is that they're behind schedule in as far as development goes.

1352
01:53:33,738 --> 01:53:39,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is their claiming due to the lack of people returning to office.

1353
01:53:41,533 --> 01:53:43,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that, but whatever.

1354
01:53:43,074 --> 01:53:57,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so, you know, there right now, employees are worried that they're going to have to get back into a crunch type of style of development, as is typical with these types of games.

1355
01:53:57,062 --> 01:54:09,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hopefully they said internally, it's pushing it back to late 2025 or 2026, maybe a possibility.

1356
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:11,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.

1357
01:54:12,196 --> 01:54:13,497
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fine with waiting.

1358
01:54:13,497 --> 01:54:14,637
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason is very silly.

1359
01:54:14,637 --> 01:54:16,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, at the, you know, here we go.

1360
01:54:16,858 --> 01:54:18,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Cue the quote.

1361
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:19,279
[SPEAKER_05]: The bad game is bad.

1362
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:20,960
[SPEAKER_05]: The good game is good forever.

1363
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,601
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you don't know the drill.

1364
01:54:22,601 --> 01:54:32,545
[SPEAKER_05]: If the delay is what needs to happen to keep the workers happy and healthy, this game is still going to sell billions of copies when it comes out.

1365
01:54:32,545 --> 01:54:34,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, maybe not that many, but still, it's going to break records.

1366
01:54:34,586 --> 01:54:37,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not about keeping the employees happy.

1367
01:54:37,227 --> 01:54:39,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about keeping the shareholders happy.

1368
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:45,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'll have to see what the shareholders want because they know best.

1369
01:54:45,064 --> 01:54:53,669
[SPEAKER_05]: The shareholders better be watching what else happens in the industry with rushed games if they want to learn to fuck or mismanaged games because there's many of them out there you can draw from.

1370
01:54:53,669 --> 01:55:02,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I would I would highly encourage because I'm sure this game is going to be chock full of ways to nickel and dime the audience with whatever they've got planned for Grand Theft 6 online.

1371
01:55:02,835 --> 01:55:03,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be bad.

1372
01:55:03,895 --> 01:55:06,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't fuck it up or you're going to lose everything.

1373
01:55:06,937 --> 01:55:07,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't fuck it up.

1374
01:55:09,892 --> 01:55:14,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, last headline tonight is a bit of sad news, DarkSakura.

1375
01:55:16,112 --> 01:55:22,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, um, the main character designer, um, for all the Tales games has died.

1376
01:55:22,154 --> 01:55:30,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Inomata Mutsumi, who, uh, did, uh, all the artwork, the character designs for those games.

1377
01:55:30,456 --> 01:55:35,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on, uh, Sunday, March 10th, age 63.

1378
01:55:35,398 --> 01:55:38,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it was apparently very sudden.

1379
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:42,019
[SPEAKER_02]: There were sketches that were left behind.

1380
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:43,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh,

1381
01:55:45,544 --> 01:55:52,366
[SPEAKER_02]: She, uh, yeah, it was just really, really, uh, very quick and tragic for the family.

1382
01:55:52,366 --> 01:55:54,667
[SPEAKER_02]: My heart goes out to the family.

1383
01:55:54,667 --> 01:55:54,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1384
01:55:54,887 --> 01:55:57,308
[SPEAKER_05]: What a, what a legendary gaming series as well.

1385
01:55:57,308 --> 01:55:59,589
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very, very sad news indeed to hear.

1386
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1387
01:55:59,649 --> 01:56:01,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1388
01:56:01,769 --> 01:56:03,270
[SPEAKER_05]: RIP for sure.

1389
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:03,890
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1390
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:05,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and that's a very young age.

1391
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:07,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it doesn't seem young, but it's young.

1392
01:56:07,851 --> 01:56:10,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, it's very sad to hear that that was sudden.

1393
01:56:11,857 --> 01:56:18,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, hopefully on a happier note, we're going to get to your calls and questions and so forth in our listener roundtable.

1394
01:56:18,682 --> 01:56:24,607
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would like to give us a call, you sure can on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com.

1395
01:56:24,607 --> 01:56:29,511
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually take a moment to check in with any emails over at participate at orangelandradio.com.

1396
01:56:29,511 --> 01:56:31,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we had any, but let me just double check.

1397
01:56:31,812 --> 01:56:32,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a one.

1398
01:56:32,873 --> 01:56:33,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a one.

1399
01:56:33,394 --> 01:56:33,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1400
01:56:34,014 --> 01:56:39,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLingerie.com is the place to do it.

1401
01:56:39,078 --> 01:56:44,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess once in a while I should actually check Twitter to see if we're getting tweeted anything, but I don't know.

1402
01:56:44,021 --> 01:56:50,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it's just spam when I go in there, so we'll see.

1403
01:56:50,846 --> 01:56:53,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1404
01:56:53,348 --> 01:56:56,069
[SPEAKER_05]: There was something in there, but it's, yeah, I'll have to respond.

1405
01:56:56,069 --> 01:56:58,091
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this is what I get for not checking Twitter enough.

1406
01:57:00,063 --> 01:57:06,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, that's that's it, I guess.

1407
01:57:06,345 --> 01:57:13,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to open it up to Discord over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord if you'd like to give us a call.

1408
01:57:13,427 --> 01:57:18,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, Loki, do we happen to have any last minute stories?

1409
01:57:18,328 --> 01:57:18,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

1410
01:57:18,888 --> 01:57:24,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Stardew Valley got a major update recently to 1.6.

1411
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:25,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1412
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:25,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't follow.

1413
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:29,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played Stardew Valley in a long time, but it sounds cool.

1414
01:57:32,694 --> 01:57:36,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I got.

1415
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:38,157
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1416
01:57:38,157 --> 01:57:44,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

1417
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:51,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm looking for a few different things, but I didn't really find too much myself.

1418
01:57:51,063 --> 01:57:52,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all right.

1419
01:57:52,683 --> 01:57:59,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like there was still like, mainly some bigger things going on this week, especially considering the last couple weeks, but it was also GDC happened this week.

1420
01:57:59,847 --> 01:57:59,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So

1421
01:58:01,601 --> 01:58:08,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though we don't usually get a ton of news out of that, usually when the industry gets together, there's some interesting things that happen, so we did have a couple headlines out of that.

1422
01:58:09,141 --> 01:58:13,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well then with that, I won't draw it out any longer than it needs to be.

1423
01:58:13,382 --> 01:58:15,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go ahead and wrap it up for the night.

1424
01:58:15,182 --> 01:58:22,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But we look forward to seeing everybody else back here next week for episode number 998, as we inch closer and closer to 1,000 weekly episodes.

1425
01:58:22,564 --> 01:58:26,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again, I really can't stress that enough for being a part of it.

1426
01:58:26,005 --> 01:58:33,546
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight, please tell a friend or two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1427
01:58:33,546 --> 01:58:36,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes,

1428
01:58:36,827 --> 01:58:41,010
[SPEAKER_05]: or Spotify or wherever it is you found this podcast goes an awful long way.

1429
01:58:41,010 --> 01:58:43,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really appreciate it.

1430
01:58:43,752 --> 01:58:45,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and get final thoughts at this point.

1431
01:58:45,653 --> 01:58:50,316
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight.

1432
01:58:50,316 --> 01:58:52,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Words.

1433
01:58:52,137 --> 01:58:57,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I'm going to be old after OLR is old.

1434
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, April's a big month, isn't it?

1435
01:58:59,882 --> 01:59:01,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1436
01:59:01,163 --> 01:59:02,183
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1437
01:59:02,183 --> 01:59:03,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, have a good stream tonight.

1438
01:59:04,551 --> 01:59:05,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, bye.

1439
01:59:05,251 --> 01:59:05,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1440
01:59:05,871 --> 01:59:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1441
01:59:08,192 --> 01:59:08,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

1442
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:12,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing everybody and I have some things to talk about.

1443
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:13,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1444
01:59:13,753 --> 01:59:14,394
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1445
01:59:14,394 --> 01:59:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1446
01:59:15,954 --> 01:59:17,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll then go to you.

1447
01:59:17,374 --> 01:59:19,815
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your final thought for tonight?

1448
01:59:19,815 --> 01:59:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm busy.

1449
01:59:20,895 --> 01:59:21,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting busy.

1450
01:59:21,496 --> 01:59:26,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, I'm hoping to finish up that first ride this week.

1451
01:59:26,437 --> 01:59:26,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Hoping.

1452
01:59:27,162 --> 01:59:28,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1453
01:59:28,763 --> 01:59:34,287
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought for tonight is I took the shrink wrap off my Final Fantasy VII Rebirth finally.

1454
01:59:34,287 --> 01:59:46,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the streams are going to start this week after me waiting for a little bit so that people that are very, very spoiler averse kind of have enough time to get through or at least get a lot further in the game than I'll be when I start streaming it this week.

1455
01:59:46,416 --> 01:59:48,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So please look forward to that.

1456
01:59:48,417 --> 01:59:51,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to jump in and play because I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1457
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:54,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard it's very easy to get distracted for a very long time.

1458
01:59:54,842 --> 01:59:55,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how that goes.

1459
01:59:56,523 --> 02:00:02,467
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, thank you again, of course, for listening to our show and being here and supporting it, whether it was on the podcast feed or live.

1460
02:00:02,467 --> 02:00:06,989
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate you and we will be back to do it all again in just seven days.

1461
02:00:06,989 --> 02:00:10,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf has let us know he will not be here next week live.

1462
02:00:10,211 --> 02:00:13,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be starting right at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock.

1463
02:00:13,313 --> 02:00:17,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not be alarmed if you don't see Bobby next week for the folks that are here live.

1464
02:00:17,075 --> 02:00:19,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to go right into our show at the normal time.

1465
02:00:19,336 --> 02:00:20,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see you then.

1466
02:00:20,577 --> 02:00:22,778
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, have a great week, everybody.

1467
02:00:24,682 --> 02:00:29,203
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1468
02:00:29,203 --> 02:00:34,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
