1
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:14,032
[SPEAKER_05]: In case you thought otherwise, it's not just deliveries to home addresses that have strange courier mistakes.

2
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:17,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Panic, makers of the bright yellow Playdate, have been subject to shipping shenanigans.

3
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:25,421
[SPEAKER_05]: As revealed in his GDC talk, a pallet of Playdates was delivered to a Circle K construction site instead of to their intended destination, the shipping warehouse next door.

4
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Data is hard, and handling is harder.

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get cranky!

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:33,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,

8
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:41,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.

9
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:46,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:59,303
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live again tonight on what is totally the first take for the 998th episode of our show tonight, March the 31st of 2024.

12
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:00,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Easter to you.

13
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:05,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Trans Day of Visibility to you and Happy Cesar Chavez Day to you.

14
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:08,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, it wasn't that hard to acknowledge multiple things on the same day.

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,531
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Jamie, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

16
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay cake!

17
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've decided to go for the cake pie.

18
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:35,223
[SPEAKER_02]: The Boston cream pie.

19
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:37,144
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of cake are you getting?

20
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:40,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Boston cream pie, which is indeed a cake pie.

21
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, I see.

22
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:42,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going there, Rob.

23
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:43,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going there.

24
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yum.

25
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone can celebrate with me.

26
00:01:48,341 --> 00:02:01,577
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of us that are watching us live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except sometimes Bobby takes the night off, as he did tonight.

27
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:04,741
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be back next week, but we are live still at 9 o'clock Eastern.

28
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And something else that is happening tonight that has never

29
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:22,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Happened before besides three misfires on the audio board would be look at this if you can see that again Sorry, this is only for the live folks that are watching live tonight Notice there is a cat behind me on the couch.

30
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,531
[SPEAKER_06]: This never happens.

31
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:31,254
[SPEAKER_06]: He's never in here actually during the show and this is why if you're gonna say why is the blanket on the couch unmade and

32
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't make it.

33
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,755
[SPEAKER_06]: He's taken up the couch.

34
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat has totally taken over.

35
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:40,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's I mean, that's what messy blankets are for is for cats to take over.

36
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:44,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is an actual rare cheddar sighting.

37
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that's the joy of being here live.

38
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:48,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to the podcast listeners.

39
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have good news for the podcast folks as well.

40
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:52,759
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, let me introduce Techmaster Loki.

41
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Loki.

42
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:54,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

43
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,020
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

44
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing okay.

45
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what is this game I see behind you live tonight?

46
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:03,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It is obviously some sort of Easter game, but not a very good one.

47
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,077
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, there's not many Easter games to pick from.

48
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:12,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, for the PlayStation 1, it is called Easter Bunny's Big Day.

49
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, okay.

50
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:20,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even, this strikes me as like, when they remade Wolfenstein 3D as a Noah's Ark game or something like that.

51
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It just, it just doesn't hit the same as the original.

52
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:33,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know what this would have originally been, but, um, yeah, I just did a real quick Easter long play and this is the first thing that came up.

53
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:33,812
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

54
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, whatever, whatever works, whatever works.

55
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:39,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we're going to get into the news as we always do here on the show.

56
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:41,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I said some good news for the podcast listeners.

57
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me tell you what it is.

58
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first, apparently bad news.

59
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:47,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the, cause you know, what's good news, that little bad news.

60
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:48,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

61
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:53,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, uh, Google has decided to kill yet another one of its products.

62
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:58,384
[SPEAKER_06]: After all this, you know, Google is infamous for not keeping its price.

63
00:03:58,384 --> 00:03:59,124
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a miracle.

64
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:03,667
[SPEAKER_06]: My Gmail account still functions and that our Google calendar still work.

65
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:08,190
[SPEAKER_06]: But Google has decided they will be killing off Google podcasts.

66
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So I used to say at the end of the show, I don't think I've said it in a while, but you could find this show on Google podcasts.

67
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:16,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you still can, at least for a few more months.

68
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:21,699
[SPEAKER_06]: But Google is going to be sunsetting podcasts in favor of YouTube podcasts.

69
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,222
[SPEAKER_06]: is the the platform they're going to be folding that into.

70
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:32,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was brought to my, it was brought to my attention through our discord server, which of course, shout out for VOGnetwork.com slash discord.

71
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It was brought to my attention that we aren't on YouTube podcasts.

72
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, what?

73
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:42,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of assumed that if we were on Google's ecosystem, we were on YouTube's podcast.

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So long story long,

75
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:46,765
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now on YouTube podcasts.

76
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:54,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So or as Tigerclaw reframes it, it's YouTube music, which happens to have a podcast section.

77
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

78
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:56,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

79
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:58,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point is- That makes sense.

80
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:58,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

81
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:01,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we're now there.

82
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:06,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you weren't aware, and YouTube is actually your preferred platform, there you go.

83
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to point out this is not the video recording of our show that we do on Twitch on YouTube.

84
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will not actually see

85
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out!

86
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,382
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

87
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:48,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we're going to get in now to some news and talk about what is going on this week.

88
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:48,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what's that?

89
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,391
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one more new thing for those who are watching live.

90
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:52,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you notice anything?

91
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, okay.

92
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is new.

93
00:05:56,611 --> 00:06:01,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, your VTube is not, uh, recording.

94
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,496
[SPEAKER_02]: This is live again, because guess what?

95
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: New Mac studio.

96
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:06,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

97
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:13,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew you got a new, um, not a new PC, a new Mac, because you were, um, talking about that on your own stream, but that's right.

98
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:15,383
[SPEAKER_02]: 64 gig of RAM.

99
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:16,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how nice.

100
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:18,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.

101
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:20,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many cores of graphics.

102
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:25,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I meant to hop in the stream last night, but I was out and about, so I didn't get to watch.

103
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:26,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play last night.

104
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I mean, two nights ago.

105
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:30,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Alicia's birthday party.

106
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,251
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've done a stream on this new computer.

107
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:32,631
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it go?

108
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:37,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did, because my computer actually arrived a day early.

109
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:39,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It arrived on Thursday.

110
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, this is just for Bradley, since he brought it up.

111
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it actually sees you down to your middle finger.

112
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think it did that before.

113
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:50,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very nice.

114
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:56,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, three, four, five, back to one.

115
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:56,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.

116
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

117
00:06:57,308 --> 00:07:01,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but yeah, I got everything ready.

118
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:07,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just decided to do my Friday Avatar stream and well, I accidentally beat the game.

119
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

120
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:11,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the longest credits ever.

121
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:21,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I made a comment at one point that I was now in a committed relationship with those credits because I was going to see them to the end and see if I got anything.

122
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:23,886
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still there's actually like an after game.

123
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:26,009
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still keep doing like your quests and stuff.

124
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to keep enjoying it.

125
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,935
[SPEAKER_06]: But it needs a game over the credits like Smash Brothers.

126
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,939
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I was screaming during that whole last fight, though, because I was like, stupid game.

127
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've tried to the only thing I've used like any kind of FAQ for was like finding stuff.

128
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:44,526
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'll talk about that in my my gaming week.

129
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:47,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to bring up that my VTuber's back.

130
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,629
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thanks for reminding.

131
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to nice to see you in motion.

132
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:51,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

133
00:07:52,532 --> 00:08:00,338
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, getting into our lead story tonight, let's talk about the Final Fantasy 14 release on the Xbox platform.

134
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not quite the news story you think.

135
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yes, the game did release on the Xbox platform.

136
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:07,183
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all you know, all out there.

137
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:08,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Final Fantasy 14.

138
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,626
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't why I'm bringing it up, though.

139
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:16,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a report that Final Fantasy 14 players that are playing on Xbox are getting banned.

140
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:24,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just for playing the game, but apparently for some of the words that they're using.

141
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:41,716
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, using the in-game chat to look for a free company with somebody going to Reddit to post that they got banned by Microsoft for advertising a free company under some type of self-promotion or even potentially like NSFW type of chat that's happening there.

142
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:47,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Microsoft is also overreaching in some of the beds.

143
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for example, you can't say Glass.

144
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,919
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just say GL, because that's censored.

145
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:00,900
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the cities in Final Fantasy XIV, or one of the regions, is Thanalan.

146
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't even type Thanalan, because it's T-H-A-N-A-L-A-N.

147
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:13,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, there's a nasty little word there in the middle.

148
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:18,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you talk about like having anal fissures and going to the doctor.

149
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:25,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the point is that Microsoft is allegedly anyway, overreaching with a lot of these bands.

150
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Their bot is too sensitive.

151
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:34,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this bot, she said, well, it's it's funny you call it a bot, because there are some reports out there.

152
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:38,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't, you know, again, we're only hearing from the user perspective.

153
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:41,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I have to say allegedly, and so forth, because we don't know.

154
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:48,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Allegedly, this person could have advertised a free company and then advertise something bad and said, Oh, I got a ban for this.

155
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how some people on the internet are.

156
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:57,803
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does seem very likely that the Microsoft ban protocol is really overreaching on this whole thing.

157
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:05,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people are bringing up the fact that Microsoft actually laid off a chunk of their moderation group.

158
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:07,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember those big layoffs that happened a few weeks ago?

159
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:12,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They've actually laid off a portion of that group in favor of, you ready?

160
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready?

161
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:17,166
[SPEAKER_06]: AI to be doing a lot of this.

162
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's really Owl.

163
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,087
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just having Owl do everything.

164
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:23,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's a Japanese girl named Ai.

165
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It means love.

166
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:32,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's, so here is the whole, now again, this is all allegedly we're making it up because of course Microsoft isn't commenting on this.

167
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:35,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Until Microsoft comments on this, we have no choice but to make it up.

168
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:43,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is what the, and Microsoft, if you're out there, this is what the internet is going to continue to do until you make this very clear for folks.

169
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,446
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to make it up.

170
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:45,726
[SPEAKER_06]: This is human nature.

171
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Your brain fills in the gaps with assumptions.

172
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,930
[SPEAKER_06]: if you don't, you know, tell people what's going on.

173
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people are saying that, you know, this is AI's fault and AI is overreaching.

174
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:14,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a case of you reap what you sow for Microsoft's case is that this, this is what you get for thinking that AI could do the job of humans, because it's going to take a very, very, very long time for machine learning to learn a lot of the nuances about

175
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:20,655
[SPEAKER_06]: The English language, let alone the hundreds of other languages that are spoken on Xbox Live.

176
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:25,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that a dirty word is not as simple as anal.

177
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:36,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Anal can be part of a larger word like thanalan, or like DarkSakura pointed out, there is completely non-abusive, derogatory, scientific reasons why you might say that.

178
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:37,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

179
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:41,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you're playing Trauma Center and you're having- I don't even think it's on Xbox.

180
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:48,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, my my cousin is in the hospital for some sort of weird anal cancer.

181
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one thing.

182
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, quite different than saying, you know, let's go do your anal cavity or something.

183
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:55,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

184
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

185
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:56,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Legit.

186
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,128
[SPEAKER_02]: You reminded me of the use of the term.

187
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:01,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Actual thing that happens.

188
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And you legit reminded me.

189
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:08,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Farrah Fawcett icon legend passed away from a cancer.

190
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:08,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

191
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,682
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I need that.

192
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:12,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you did a lot of people.

193
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:13,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the same day as Michael Jackson.

194
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:17,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why a lot of people like Sarah Fawcett was more important.

195
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:18,384
[SPEAKER_02]: What an icon.

196
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,624
[SPEAKER_06]: She was an icon.

197
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:21,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm saying that hair icon.

198
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:27,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying that complete seriousness is that if you want to be able to raise awareness, it's not a teehee giggly thing.

199
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:31,367
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a serious thing that has taken the lives of iconic people.

200
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: This stream was talking about the Panama Canal or what about an analysis?

201
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:36,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

202
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:36,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

203
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there is a difference between an analysis and an analysis.

204
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:46,633
[SPEAKER_06]: All this talk is like, you know, and obviously, obviously, we are hyper fixated on one thing.

205
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

206
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,375
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hyper fixated on the on the anus.

207
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

208
00:12:49,996 --> 00:13:01,505
[SPEAKER_06]: But joking aside, like, obviously, it goes to show there is so much nuance with language that you can't expect an automated system to be able to catch.

209
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:05,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously- And you're being so anal about it.

210
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:10,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And MMOs require people to be able to communicate.

211
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:18,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to talk about, hey, you complete that quest in central Thanalan is important to the game.

212
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:23,369
[SPEAKER_06]: You collect those gears with mining in East Thanalan.

213
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be able to say those types of things.

214
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:35,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So this whole moderation thing, and to be fair, the Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is already fucking weird.

215
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why is because you have to pay with the Xbox coins.

216
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:45,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have your sub directly through the Mog Station like you do on other platforms.

217
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:51,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have Xbox Gold or whatever it's called now, Game Pass Essentials, whatever they call what used to be gold.

218
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,704
[SPEAKER_02]: The stream says the butthole Ian.

219
00:13:54,704 --> 00:14:05,374
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be able to have Game Pass and the subscription, which a lot of people are saying you have to double dip because on PlayStation, you don't have to have PlayStation Plus in order to play Final Fantasy XIV online.

220
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:09,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So Microsoft, for whatever reason, is putting all of these other barriers in it.

221
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:16,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you can't even say Free Company or Thanalan or whatever, because there might be a dirty word in it.

222
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:19,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's let's set about free company though.

223
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I Oh, well, no, I don't think it's actually the word free company.

224
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:35,587
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think because somebody was shouting, Hey, are you interested in joining a group of like minded people that it was advertising for their free company, but the game picked it up as spam, basically is what sounds like.

225
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So and there should you know, sure.

226
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Free company for only $5 a minute.

227
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:45,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Call 1-800 or 1-900 free company.

228
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:56,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, DarkSakura, you joke, but do you know what they also advertise a lot of times in chat is the after dark dance parties that happen in the housing districts in Final Fantasy 14.

229
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,105
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a real, real fucking thing.

230
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not making this up.

231
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:03,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Discord parties, DJ, it's all.

232
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

233
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,872
[SPEAKER_02]: The Eorzea Circuit Party.

234
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:07,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

235
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: The Eorzea Circuit Party.

236
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:12,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, they advertised on a billboard one time that was in the news.

237
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:14,818
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you should be allowed.

238
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:20,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even though I understand those things can be inconvenient, they do have a right to shout in those channels.

239
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:23,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you, you know, you can always turn those channels off and so forth.

240
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least, you know, they're, they're doing it the way they should.

241
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just sucks to see them penalized for it.

242
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I even say penalized?

243
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is the system going to pick that up as a dirty word too?

244
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, I guess you could get a penal cyst.

245
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream in chat says, what about free anal?

246
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Join us.

247
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,691
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think you could be.

248
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:49,275
[SPEAKER_06]: The system probably wouldn't like that, like extra, extra a lot.

249
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:50,897
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just the thing.

250
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: What about annual?

251
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,181
[SPEAKER_02]: People typo that all the time as anal, right?

252
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:55,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

253
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:00,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't expect AI to do a person's job.

254
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't believe Microsoft, one of the leading tech companies out there, is going to learn this fucking lesson the hard way.

255
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can actually believe it.

256
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,433
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also can't believe it.

257
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:11,675
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just... I...

258
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:31,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's yet again, another one of those boardroom executive stuffy folk mistakes that make way too much money mistakes that just don't fucking understand how gaming fucking works making these decisions that then just make them look ridiculous, which is what this whole thing is doing.

259
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think we just need robots to not do moderation.

260
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Robots can maybe select things that could be looked at by a human or maybe highlight things that should be looked at later.

261
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,587
[SPEAKER_06]: But the system shouldn't be doing the bands automatically.

262
00:16:52,587 --> 00:17:08,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, they should understand this is the whole mantra of robotic process automation, which is you have to have it be repeatable and rule-based in order to be able to do any sort of thing with AI or machine learning or that type of thing.

263
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be predictable enough to follow certain guidelines.

264
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:17,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're not also understanding context, obviously.

265
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's one thing that robots don't understand a lot of times is context.

266
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:25,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why we run into this type of stuff.

267
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:31,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this honestly, and I don't I don't mean to, you know, be exaggeratory or whatever, but also I kind of mean it.

268
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:40,824
[SPEAKER_06]: This this this type of thing ought to be something that Microsoft ought to be held accountable for because their their whole ban appealing system is not great.

269
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:46,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes people forever to have things looked at, if they even get it looked at at all, again, by a real person.

270
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:58,593
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I pointed out, for this person advertising their free company to be able to play Final Fantasy XIV online, they're paying a Game Pass sub, they're paying for Xbox coins, and now they've been booted off the system for no reason.

271
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:04,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand that's all in the fine print that you're supposed to scroll through that nobody actually reads, that they are able to do that.

272
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I do realize that, but at the same time, there comes a point where it's like,

273
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,524
[SPEAKER_06]: The breach of contract is so egregious as it's happening here that that should not apply.

274
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that there is no realistic system to have things appealed in a timely manner, this person should get their money back.

275
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,716
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.

276
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And they ought to be entitled to get their money back.

277
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,081
[SPEAKER_06]: At least to do a proper appeal.

278
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:29,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

279
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:37,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So I look, I don't I don't want to call out the lawyer vultures to come to action.

280
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,840
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think I'm going to have to in this case.

281
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to call out those Facebook ads that always pop up on my thing.

282
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you bought something from Steam?

283
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you subscribed to World of Warcraft?

284
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:50,844
[SPEAKER_06]: You could be entitled that which is that all that stuff is a scam.

285
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:55,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But but we need the actual lawyer vultures to come out and do a class action on this.

286
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,366
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the only way this shit's gonna change.

287
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,867
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the it's going to take a fucking class action lawsuit for this to change.

288
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:06,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And so free company person, I hope you get in on that.

289
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:12,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm sure of course, a class action lawsuit is literally not going to cause anybody to actually get their money back.

290
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:16,433
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will cause Microsoft to change the system.

291
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:22,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's like the one time I actually feel like it might be a good thing until I'm convinced otherwise.

292
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:30,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, we'll get into our gaming weeks and hopefully we weren't banned from any platforms this week, but stay tuned.

293
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we were.

294
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:33,171
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

295
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:33,832
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

296
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good.

297
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:47,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I got my... I played Dead by Daylight with Fixie and Shayla on Tuesday, which was great because I miss playing with the both of them together.

298
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:52,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made another new friend who played with us.

299
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get my computer on Thursday, a Mac Studio.

300
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, of course, get the biggest one because I just didn't have the three grand for it, you know?

301
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one I got is is pretty great.

302
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:13,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like the second level processor and yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty happy with it.

303
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:18,416
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could find the specs, I would go over a bit more.

304
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah.

305
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:30,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I got is I have an M2 Max with a 12 core CPU, 38 core GPU, 16 core neural engine, 64 gigabyte of RAM, one terabyte SSD and

306
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:37,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly made it where I can use my VTuber and even right now.

307
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:49,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I have everything that I normally have running during this show, and my full VTuber running, and Daz Studio, which is a 3D software application running in the background as well.

308
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm feeling no pain.

309
00:20:51,010 --> 00:21:05,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure my animation is smooth, and everything is fine, so... Of course, that made playing Avatar really nice, but then I learned something is that the problems I'm having with OBS are independent of my computer's capabilities.

310
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:13,004
[SPEAKER_02]: and that GeForce likes to apply its own idea of a web connection.

311
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,966
[SPEAKER_02]: That has nothing to do with my Gigabit Ethernet either.

312
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:18,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So, running into some issues there.

313
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:24,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did up my bitrate for Twitch and it still kept up pretty well.

314
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:25,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked alright.

315
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:30,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I beat Avatar Frontiers of Pandora and I'm going to keep playing.

316
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:37,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not play Castlevania or Dracula XX or whatever because I was at my friend's party.

317
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:48,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to be playing more Dead by Daylight tonight and I'm prepping up for a marathon on my birthday.

318
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:53,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've started like another really stupid game today.

319
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what's it called?

320
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Tamagotchi game.

321
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Tamagotchi World Adventure.

322
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:00,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

323
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:11,429
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like some Animal Crossing ripoff stuff in there, so I'm not gonna go too far into that.

324
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:16,611
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it was a fun little waste of time, you know.

325
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:18,151
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's been it.

326
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:23,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly been me trying to... I haven't tried Baldur's Gate on this computer.

327
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:25,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't know if I'll be able to stream it at all.

328
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:38,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm gonna go see what happens if I can run Baldur's Gate 3 at max level, because I have the native Mac version.

329
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:38,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

330
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:39,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

331
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:40,238
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

332
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:41,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm having fun.

333
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

334
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beefy.

335
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always fun to have a shiny new computer.

336
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tall.

337
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:49,821
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you know about how tall the Mac mini is?

338
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:50,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

339
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,523
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about three Mac minis and a trench coat tall.

340
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

341
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:58,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's I like it.

342
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:58,805
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

343
00:22:58,805 --> 00:22:59,385
[SPEAKER_06]: My baby.

344
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a new name for her, though.

345
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:05,228
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have a contest to name.

346
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:05,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

347
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:06,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Spawn.

348
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

349
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:08,650
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki.

350
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say the Tower of Glower.

351
00:23:12,052 --> 00:23:13,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your game week?

352
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was pretty much Minecraft.

353
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think it was all Minecraft.

354
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:24,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I took a couple days off to work on, um, the theme park ride stuff.

355
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't end up doing that the entire time.

356
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:31,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, I did some of the things that are going towards my next episode.

357
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:37,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I got, like, two big farms done, and just some other, like, nonsense grinding and stuff.

358
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:39,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did end up working on some of it, though, so I have, uh,

359
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like woolboxing out like the rooms and the show buildings and stuff to try to figure out where all that stuff's going to be laid out.

360
00:23:49,440 --> 00:24:02,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still going to be a process, but I'm trying to work on that and then get, you know, episode content ready to go as well so I can put stuff out while I'm working on this big project.

361
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:06,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, good luck.

362
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see my gaming week.

363
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, kind of similar stuff to what I usually play Final Fantasy 14.

364
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:16,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually didn't play the Xbox version of Final Fantasy 14 because I just wanted to unlock achievements.

365
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

366
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you do have Game Pass Ultimate, you can get the starter edition of Final Fantasy 14.

367
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:25,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just installed that on my Xbox, I logged in, and you have to

368
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:52,770
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to do things to like trigger the checks like you have to kill a mob to get all the mob related achievements you have to finish a quest to get all the quest related achievements so i didn't get everything because unfortunately the raids you have to do by clearing the raid there's no way to just like get them all but i got a good i got probably like a thousand achievement points just from my fall fantasy history just from like loading it up and and doing a few uh little tasks in game but um

369
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably all I'll really play of that version for now.

370
00:24:56,774 --> 00:25:00,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe I'll play on the TV downstairs at some point, but that's where my Series X is hooked up.

371
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:01,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I did all of this through

372
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,557
[SPEAKER_06]: playing on the network, Remote Play.

373
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:10,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was on my PC, but I was playing the Xbox downstairs, which I do love that system, to be honest.

374
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Remote Play stuff.

375
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,141
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been great for that kind of thing.

376
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:20,246
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, because not only did I do it for Final Fantasy XIV, I did it for Diablo IV, because Diablo IV I've also been playing this week.

377
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:21,987
[SPEAKER_06]: And that came out on Game Pass.

378
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:22,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.

379
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I went in and got about 250 achievement points.

380
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me wish there was a universal achievement system across all platforms.

381
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I know that's where it was something like that.

382
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:46,808
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had, when I lost stadia, right.

383
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:48,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to redo all of my DB.

384
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:52,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The only of my DVD things that I did not have to redo is my P three 50.

385
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, they're number one, there's no way, but I had logged in on steam just before that ended.

386
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:01,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it would, it would have seen you already had a character that was there.

387
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:01,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's yeah.

388
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:05,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's now considered like, it's like their only legacy achievement left.

389
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:06,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

390
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

391
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,359
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

392
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:11,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so it was fun to pop the achievements.

393
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:17,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I've actually been playing Diablo 4 because this weekend they've done an experience boost.

394
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:21,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm kind of working on that to level my Barbarian through the current season.

395
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:23,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel like the battle pass

396
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,057
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

397
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:44,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

398
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:46,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll gain progress as I get more achievements.

399
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:49,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe this will be the first character I get to 100.

400
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:49,387
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

401
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:53,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the current season got extended because they're doing all this stuff.

402
00:26:53,688 --> 00:27:01,050
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically reworking the entire loot and endgame system for the next season in response to a lot of the feedback they're getting.

403
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So they had to extend this current season by a month, which is fine.

404
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll give me time to finish it.

405
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Diablo 4 is on Game Pass

406
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:29,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pick up the Final Fantasy XIV Starter Edition on Game Pass if you are not already a subscriber to XIV.

407
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:33,867
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a subscriber to XIV already, yes, go get it, get your license set up and all that stuff.

408
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have never played XIV before, stick with the free edition until you decide you want to stick with it because once you get that starter edition, you can never go back to the free edition and you'll have to pay a monthly sub.

409
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:47,858
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to play it.

410
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:52,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's another one of those things that I think is way too overcomplicated about the system.

411
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,081
[SPEAKER_06]: But alas, here we are in the year 2024.

412
00:27:56,081 --> 00:28:00,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't simply and they're still charging money for Final Fantasy 11, quite frankly.

413
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:05,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, there's certain things that I don't think Square's figured out or Microsoft, to be quite honest.

414
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:06,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

415
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:16,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well with that we will get into some gaming news and I guess Loki starting us off with some other things that Microsoft hasn't seemed to figure out such as stopping leaks, right?

416
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:18,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

417
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:29,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently, well, we kind of knew that this was coming, I think, from some other leaked stuff where they had, you know, talked about future SKUs and stuff like that.

418
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:40,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we have what appears to be a leaked image of an Xbox Series X that is all white and without a disk drive.

419
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:49,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently it's supposed to be coming out priced under $500 with an improved heatsink but no other major enhancements.

420
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a larger...

421
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:52,670
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

422
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:24,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

423
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:25,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't want this.

424
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:30,297
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks more like a mini fridge than the normal Series X, so... Who knows?

425
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:40,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I understand that digital is where a lot of things are going and that they probably are doing a refresh to maybe try to move more units over the summer and holiday.

426
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:43,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is too big a deal, though.

427
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:55,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's I mean, it's nice to have choice, I guess, as long as they're not like saying, oh, yeah, we're going to discontinue the Series X, I guess, as is with the

428
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:58,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Switch 2

429
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:33,300
[SPEAKER_06]: June will be when we know for sure because either we get something announced for the holiday or nothing is announced at all except more Switch games.

430
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:41,983
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's interesting, some moving and shakies going on at the official Nintendo testing center, apparently before the Switch 2 becomes a thing.

431
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:55,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, some current and former contractors mentioned that there was a massive downsizing that was going on, meaning layoffs with the video game industry were affecting them as well.

432
00:30:55,673 --> 00:31:00,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And these reports about the launch of Switch 2 being delayed until 2025.

433
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:12,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, in a statement, said these changes will involve some contractor assignments ending as well as the creation of a significant number of new full-time employee positions.

434
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: All I can see in my head is that TikTok of the, you have been promoted.

435
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:21,579
[SPEAKER_06]: You are now one of my elite employees.

436
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:30,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's, this is exactly what this Nintendo email sounds like, is we fired that person, but now you've been promoted to this other person.

437
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:32,362
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what this, I'm sorry.

438
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:40,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't laugh because, you know, some people lost their job and that sucks, but like this, literally, that's what this statement sounds like to me.

439
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:41,885
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all, if you haven't seen.

440
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:44,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I say it's on TikTok.

441
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:50,592
[SPEAKER_06]: But just like anything on those short video platforms that that videos everywhere, Instagram, Reels, YouTube, whatever.

442
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:54,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've seen this if you spend any time looking at all those shit posts on those platforms.

443
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:59,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, uh, let's see where we're getting more more money.

444
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,862
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm afraid we don't have it in the budget.

445
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:08,545
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, NOA will offer severance packages, provide assistance during the transition.

446
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:12,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they say we're incredibly grateful for the important contributions, blah, blah, blah.

447
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:16,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know exactly how many employees this is.

448
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:27,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the, the people that kind of leaked this information to the press say it could be about a hundred contractors, but again, we don't really know cause they're not saying exactly what the number is there.

449
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:29,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

450
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:29,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

451
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:34,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, apparently, the same people that got laid off and squealed to the press

452
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:49,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, I don't know, maybe there's a reason, I shouldn't say that, but you know, they have now squealed about none of them, apparently no one there was having any hands-on time with the upcoming Switch 2.

453
00:32:49,088 --> 00:33:00,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So these folks are allegedly confirming that the Switch 2 has not even been testing yet, which would seem to lend credit to it's not happening until 2025, and this restructuring could be

454
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:05,213
[SPEAKER_06]: As we are getting so maybe they cut out the people that tend to squeal.

455
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:05,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

456
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:18,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think this is just if you lay off people and these press companies have anonymous signal accounts, you know, there's there's people that are going to be more than happy to burn their former employer once they realize that loyalty is not there.

457
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:20,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

458
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:23,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe that is why they're doing it now.

459
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they won't squeal.

460
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:25,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

461
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:26,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

462
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:29,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so that's, that's all what's going on.

463
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:39,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So just the report there that also the Switch 2 doesn't even appear to have been being tested yet, but perhaps this whole shift is because that's coming soon.

464
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:41,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're kind of locking in the current system.

465
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

466
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,301
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

467
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:44,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on, DarkSakura.

468
00:33:46,130 --> 00:34:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in terms of layoffs and other things happening, Sega is selling off Relic Entertainment and laying off about 240 employees across Europe.

469
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:01,947
[SPEAKER_02]: They, and this is

470
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:24,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Their quote about why is that the business environment surrounding the consumer area especially in the European region is rapidly changing and then reactionary decline from the stay-at-home demand in COVID-19 and the economic downturn due to inflation Basically, we ain't making enough money and people ain't going out and spending enough

471
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and the same reason every tech company is claiming right now.

472
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:30,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

473
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:35,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's funny how they talk about like, you know, economic downturn and all that stuff.

474
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:39,502
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet, $70 games.

475
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:40,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

476
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:40,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

477
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:43,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they want us to buy the games, drop the price point on the game.

478
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no.

479
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, $70 games with a battle pass.

480
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,944
[SPEAKER_04]: With a battle pass and DLC and all other stuff.

481
00:34:50,944 --> 00:34:52,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And loot boxes.

482
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:54,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And horse armor.

483
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:54,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

484
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,860
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I want my horse to be well protected?

485
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,062
[SPEAKER_06]: You have every right you have every right to buy that there's nothing I'm not gonna people can spend money on what they like.

486
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I'm part of the problem.

487
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the Diablo four battle pass.

488
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:10,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of my I got a $70 game.

489
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:14,825
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, I got $100 game because I bought the limited edition.

490
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have a battle pass.

491
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:19,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, season one's battle passes was included with that price.

492
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,746
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I bought season two and season three.

493
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm part of the problem.

494
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:22,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So

495
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:37,628
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was saying, basically something that's coming out of this though is that Relic is going independent.

496
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:44,635
[SPEAKER_02]: They found an external investor and they are going to continue on their current projects like Company of Heroes 3 and

497
00:35:48,169 --> 00:36:02,678
[SPEAKER_02]: They are still working on the update coming out in April, new content, and of course, their quote on here, we want to thank Sega, whose support over the years and guidance during this transition have been instrumental to our success.

498
00:36:02,678 --> 00:36:07,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We may be out of the Sega business, but we remain friends and colleagues, meaning we ain't burning our bridges.

499
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:13,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We may even see a return of some previous things that they might have been working at, like when they cancelled Hyenas.

500
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who knows?

501
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll have something.

502
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll have something new from them.

503
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:41,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But, it is... I think it's a pretty good thing that the company itself is surviving.

504
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:43,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see what comes of them.

505
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we sure will.

506
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:52,449
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to hear at least that you know, the studio was goes independent as opposed to just closing.

507
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:55,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, somewhat of a nice footnote.

508
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,391
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

509
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:58,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something.

510
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:02,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, let's talk about that economy for another company.

511
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:04,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's talk about it.

512
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So GameStop.

513
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:06,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, still struggling.

514
00:37:07,415 --> 00:37:14,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought that they didn't make all their money back with the crazy stock prices that they had.

515
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,200
[SPEAKER_06]: And the NFT marketplace didn't make them billionaires.

516
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought that that would take off.

517
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:24,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Their independent software store that they were in.

518
00:37:24,164 --> 00:37:26,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Who could have predicted the flop of NFTs?

519
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:27,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Who?

520
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:28,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Who could have predicted that?

521
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:30,959
[SPEAKER_04]: No one could have predicted that.

522
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous.

523
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:42,829
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so they apparently are having some financial trouble because, you know, sales are starting to go more digital.

524
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:48,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially now that we have, you know, more consoles going all digital as well.

525
00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:52,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obviously eating into their profits.

526
00:37:52,125 --> 00:38:01,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So, apparently, GameStop said earlier that their earnings for 2023, their fourth quarter, totaled $1.79 billion compared to the same period in 2022.

527
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:04,850
[SPEAKER_04]: That was $2.23 billion, so a 20% decline in sales overall.

528
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:28,182
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that the increasing mix of digital downloads is hurting physical retail and there is simply no reason to go to the store if a consumer can just order the game and download it immediately.

529
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:34,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Revenues are highly unlikely to rebound unless management figures out ways to drive store traffic.

530
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:41,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, kind of like so, like actually this week I did end up going into a GameStop.

531
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: We were killing time.

532
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:52,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We were killing time, but there's not a lot in there anymore.

533
00:38:52,388 --> 00:39:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They have their huge wall of Funko Pops, they have a lot of video game memorabilia type stuff, PC hardware even, peripherals and whatnot, but there's not a lot that really

534
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:09,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Screams out I gotta buy this.

535
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:16,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus when you think about it, there's a lot of games out there now where the physical edition is just a case and a download code.

536
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:23,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it doesn't make sense to go in and go purchase that through a physical retailer.

537
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: to just, you know, essentially get the same thing just with extra garbage that you're going to throw away.

538
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:36,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, on top of that, like I think even the discounts on their games weren't even very good.

539
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:45,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was looking at even used copies and it's just like a few bucks cheaper than what it is normally for games that have been out for a very long time.

540
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:48,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think Skyrim on the Switch was still $50.

541
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:54,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no, I'm not buying it for that price.

542
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:54,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

543
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

544
00:39:57,381 --> 00:40:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been struggling for a while, but they didn't do anything smart with their extra... They're loading themselves along.

545
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:05,366
[SPEAKER_06]: In part, I'm kind of surprised they're still there, to be honest.

546
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:12,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, they didn't do anything as far as, you know, utilizing the extra capital they have to do something meaningful.

547
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:14,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they chased trends, which...

548
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:18,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anybody could have told them we're going to fail.

549
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:23,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and I feel like they're also chasing trends a little bit behind the curve is what's happening.

550
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:32,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, yet again, management not being, you know, having the foresight, you know, investing in dumb things like NFT and, you know, Funko Pops.

551
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:41,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I understand they're popular, but I also I don't know, am I just being an old funny daddy feeling like the bubble on Funko Pops is mostly bursts?

552
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:43,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know people still collect them, but I feel like

553
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:48,757
[SPEAKER_06]: is it is the demand there for those things to be in like every GameStop across the country?

554
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:49,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

555
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

556
00:40:51,219 --> 00:41:05,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, honestly, with that type of stuff, like they're so large, like I just wouldn't have... Funko Pops are in Hot Topic, Box Lunch, they're in every fucking Spencer Gifts, they're in every fucking store, right?

557
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:09,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And but and to that to to that sense as well,

558
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:26,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, cool, there's Funko Pops at GameStop, but, like, if I'm searching for a Funko Pop for something specific, I go on the internet and search for it and order it online and have it shipped to my door.

559
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:31,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't need to go into GameStop to go see, ooh, what Funko Pops do you got in here?

560
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're doing, like, bicycle trade of that stuff, which,

561
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,521
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point at that point?

562
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:38,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I don't know.

563
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:47,310
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just, it's, it's not, we're not in a landscape where we used to be where pre-internet, yeah, they, they had a list of like, here's what's coming out.

564
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, Oh, I need to go to them for my, my information on what I should order and all that stuff or what I should pick up.

565
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like, I don't need them because I have the internet.

566
00:41:58,919 --> 00:41:59,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I have,

567
00:42:00,246 --> 00:42:02,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Millions of different YouTubers out there reviewing different things.

568
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:19,948
[SPEAKER_06]: WhatSquare is able to do.

569
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:23,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people are incentivized to just buy it right there online.

570
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:27,250
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's one example, but many games are like this at this point.

571
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I think GameStop, you know, the used game market is still a thing.

572
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:43,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think GameStop can exist somewhat on that front, but I think they also need to really lean into, I do think the right shift is to shift into like nerd culture types of those sorts of things.

573
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think of a store like BoxLunch,

574
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:47,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And I enjoy those stores and I go into them all.

575
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:48,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're neat.

576
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:52,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I think they do very well, they're split up into these different sections.

577
00:42:52,468 --> 00:42:55,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you can go to like, oh, here's the Star Wars section.

578
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the Harry Potter section.

579
00:42:57,316 --> 00:43:01,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Although if you're a Harry Potter fan in 2024, anyway, that's a whole other subject.

580
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:05,384
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop would be smart to make a similar pivot

581
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:19,850
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

582
00:43:40,649 --> 00:44:04,566
[SPEAKER_06]: what's that one it used to be attic salt and they changed their name to something else something fire I don't know but they it can kind of hold its own against a lot of these companies that just sell neat stuff like if GameStop had a Final Fantasy section because let me tell you 14 players a battle net Overwatch Wow stuff you know but not just old shirts that you can get online but like really like cool other memorabilia and stuff

583
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:10,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they need to have a, they need to differentiate themselves with this stuff.

584
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:22,718
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, I mean, I hate to say this cause we hated the GameStop exclusive nonsense when it came to like pre-order stuff, but, but for the sake, for the sake of their business, they need to have something that only you can get at GameStop.

585
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:32,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether, I don't necessarily think it needs to be products, but it could be just like a service or something, but it's, it's hard to say what that would be in this day and age.

586
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:33,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be.

587
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:38,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know, like Landcenter type gaming or something.

588
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:39,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to get people in the store.

589
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with that type of merchandise.

590
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:44,872
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also expect that sometimes stores are going to have exclusives, right?

591
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:55,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, if you have an expensive coach bag, you had to get that from a coach store or a back alley in New York City that looks really, really, really similar.

592
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:55,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Goodwill.

593
00:44:56,684 --> 00:45:24,200
[SPEAKER_06]: but you get my you get my drift you know you kind of expect that you know to get these sorts of exclusives you're gonna you have to go to certain stores that's that's especially when it comes to like shirts and and clothing and things like that that's not i don't think that's too wild to expect that you know they're they're gonna have and we we've uh what we just had the final fantasy shirt collection was it uniclo right that that's the type of thing that should have been a gamestop thing why did gamestop let uniclo have that

594
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, don't get me wrong, I love Uniqlo, so I'm glad they did.

595
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:32,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the type of shit that GameStop needs to be fighting for, not fucking NFTs.

596
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:42,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And Funko Pops, which, by the way, in chat, DJ Ranma S says, the Funko Pop bubble burst last year when they wrote off $30 million of merchandise, dumping them in the trash.

597
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:50,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I don't want to... I've gotten in trouble for speaking ill of Funko Pops on this program before, and I'm not planning to do that.

598
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:52,969
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I do think it's the type of thing where it's like,

599
00:45:54,164 --> 00:45:58,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a it's I think when I think of Funko Pops, I think of anime conventions and gaming conventions.

600
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:01,346
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the type of place where you expect to buy and sell that stuff.

601
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:05,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Not every fucking nerd store in America is just a lot.

602
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:08,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And Target.

603
00:46:08,028 --> 00:46:10,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Target has quite a few of those.

604
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:11,790
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

605
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like even the bubbles bursting with the Target supply and all that stuff, too.

606
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:16,071
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway.

607
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:26,644
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well moving on here's here's another thing that you know, again, GameStop might want to get on this because I think a lot of people are going to be very excited about this.

608
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:31,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's it's GameStop won't sell a single copy of this game.

609
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel Rivals

610
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Play

611
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:24,479
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 6v6 team-based shooter, it will be free to play, and the universe is said to be continually evolving, so new heroes, new villains, new maps, new challenges, all the same shit you expect from a product that is inspired by Overwatch.

612
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:26,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the alpha launch will be out in May.

613
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:37,610
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of the characters you can play when the first testing version goes up will be Spider-Man, Black Panther, Magneto, Magic, and apparently some other unannounced characters.

614
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:45,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Developers did mention characters like Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Hulk, and Iron Man will be playable, but not known if that's in the alpha or not.

615
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:50,120
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also seen screenshots with Doctor Strange, Storm, Scarlet Witch.

616
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

617
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,183
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a very large Marvel roster for them to choose from.

618
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:59,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And even if your favorite character is not in the game when this game releases, they probably could come out eventually.

619
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:00,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what?

620
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:02,387
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like 80,000 things in the Marvel roster.

621
00:48:02,387 --> 00:48:04,368
[SPEAKER_06]: There's who knows who knows.

622
00:48:04,368 --> 00:48:05,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, um,

623
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:12,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, more to come when we get the testing in May, so check that out.

624
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:21,581
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know a lot of people that are into Overwatch are keeping an eye on this one because, you know, Overwatch 2 has had it a little bit rough.

625
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:22,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

626
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:31,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very curious how these next few months treat Overwatch 2 now that they are no longer under Activision and you're already seeing change happen.

627
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:36,112
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, they released a brand new hero this weekend, Venture.

628
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:38,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And Venture's a new hero that you can... Is that the name?

629
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:39,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Venture?

630
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:42,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it... Yeah, I think so.

631
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:42,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

632
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:43,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, I think their name was Venture.

633
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:50,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something with a V. But Venture's a new hero that was available on the live servers for just this weekend.

634
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:54,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And when Season 10 comes out, they are going to be included.

635
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:57,130
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to have to get them through the Battle Pass or anything like that.

636
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,571
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just a character you're going to pick up.

637
00:48:59,171 --> 00:48:59,772
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.

638
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:35,980
[SPEAKER_06]: In all of the announcement posts and the bio posts, Venture is using they them pronouns which is very exciting for non-binary individuals that would like to see some representation in games and Overwatch 2 has done a lot of representation very well so we have

639
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:38,546
[SPEAKER_06]: who appears to be our first.

640
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:42,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Blizzard has actually come out and said they are non-binary.

641
00:49:42,727 --> 00:49:44,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen articles that said that.

642
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:44,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

643
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:50,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the articles are inferring it based on the Blizzard post because Blizzard is not using any other pronouns besides they them.

644
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:55,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But Blizzard never came out and said Venture is a non-binary hero, at least as far as I know.

645
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:59,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just in all the promotional materials people noticed.

646
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:01,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is this is the hilarious thing.

647
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:04,992
[SPEAKER_06]: because I was because I was doing what I shouldn't do.

648
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:08,415
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was reading the comment section, especially it was on Facebook.

649
00:50:08,415 --> 00:50:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually where I saw the new hero announced was on Facebook.

650
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:17,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody in the comments was intentionally trying to misgender this character.

651
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:24,711
[SPEAKER_06]: But the problem is, half of them are saying she and half of them are saying he because

652
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:35,292
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know, and that's kind of what's sort of awesome about this, and Blizzard simply just letting this be a fucking fact.

653
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:38,461
[SPEAKER_06]: they them deal with it.

654
00:50:38,461 --> 00:50:44,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I don't know there's something there's something very fascinating about watching this play out and watching the trolls play themselves.

655
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:46,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is.

656
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:51,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But I find it very fascinating as frustrating as as much as it makes me weep for humanity.

657
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:59,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, Phil of nine and chat says, Rob, we got to turn your parental controls back on.

658
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:00,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay out of the comments.

659
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:00,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

660
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:02,067
[SPEAKER_06]: right.

661
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:18,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike def does bring back an interesting point here is Mike def says I say a but that's because in Spanish we don't have non binary pronouns and I believe that's where the whole like Latin x was coming from in part right or

662
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a whole debate on that whole thing right now, actually, that I'm not sure I want to wade into.

663
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:30,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, you know, because and I don't think Spanish is the only language that's extremely gendered.

664
00:51:30,524 --> 00:51:32,225
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of languages where words change.

665
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:32,825
[SPEAKER_06]: French.

666
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:33,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

667
00:51:33,246 --> 00:51:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of languages rooted in change based on, you know, whether a person is male or female.

668
00:51:39,988 --> 00:51:41,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

669
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:51,123
[SPEAKER_06]: SH100mat says, yeah, folks made a stink about Morph being non-binary for X-Men 97, but they got over it because the series has been good.

670
00:51:51,123 --> 00:51:53,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even, I need to watch X-Men 97, man.

671
00:51:53,804 --> 00:51:55,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it's, apparently it's really good.

672
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.

673
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:57,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

674
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:57,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

675
00:51:57,705 --> 00:51:59,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to sit down and watch it.

676
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:06,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but I mean, but it makes sense to somebody who doesn't technically have a form with any defining features.

677
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:09,078
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

678
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:37,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we remember the play date.

679
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:42,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certain people on this podcast own one, right?

680
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:43,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain people want one.

681
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:48,467
[SPEAKER_02]: $40,000 worth of them have gone missing.

682
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:54,771
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two pallets at a shopping center in Las Vegas and they're gone.

683
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They went missing.

684
00:52:57,853 --> 00:52:59,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a heist!

685
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:04,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It got on that train even though it was in Las Vegas and probably at a store.

686
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:12,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they were looking at the inventory numbers at the shopping center in Las Vegas and some of the numbers didn't add up.

687
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:17,967
[SPEAKER_02]: and they found that two pallets of them were unaccounted for.

688
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:26,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, it's like the shopping center said FedEx claimed that they were delivered, but they have no trace of them.

689
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:35,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another set of pallets that were eventually recovered ended up being delivered to a construction site of a Circle K next door to the shopping center.

690
00:53:39,192 --> 00:53:42,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Strange things are afoot at the Circle K. Right.

691
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:58,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But the person, Cable Sasser, who's the co-founder of Playdate, showed a picture of the pallet just sitting there in the open, and then someone went to go get them.

692
00:54:01,497 --> 00:54:09,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the same person was supposed to sign off on both of the palettes, and they signed off on the ones that were at the construction site.

693
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:17,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that person is probably promoted to customer at that shopping center.

694
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:19,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You have been demoted!

695
00:54:19,514 --> 00:54:23,918
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's promoted to customer.

696
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,501
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chats asks, could it be an inside job?

697
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:58,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they drive a bunch of minis in and load them up into little minis and then drive off with them through a sewer?

698
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be really hard to flip all those, too.

699
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's a pretty niche console.

700
00:55:09,231 --> 00:55:12,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I get people that want it, but it's still pretty niche.

701
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:36,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll they'll end up on like street vendors and those those sorts of things where people just go, oh, it's a neat little system.

702
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:49,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I know folks in chat are saying eBay, but I feel like eBay is a lot maybe some of oil, but I feel like eBay is a lot more traceable to although would they I don't know if they'd necessarily be able to know that this was something that was taken off a pallet or it's a legit sale.

703
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:50,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So

704
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Podculture suggests Teemu.

705
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:54,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's that's where they're getting their deals.

706
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

707
00:55:55,012 --> 00:56:00,037
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but you know, it's it is wild to think about where these things might be being flipped.

708
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:02,240
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

709
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean322 in chat says GameStop exclusive Play Day handhelds.

710
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, maybe that's GameStop's new business model.

711
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:31,154
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, carrying the Playdate in their store wouldn't be viable for them because that's an entirely digital console, but that piece of hardware being in a store would be something that's exclusive

712
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:34,256
[SPEAKER_04]: to that store because it's right now it's only available online.

713
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:51,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So like that would be something that I could see like almost like feels like they should be kind of going the whole Netflix route in the sense that they have or maybe even like Netflix, Amazon, where they have like people that are creating custom like software games for their platform.

714
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:55,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So like GameStop almost needs to be like a publisher at some point and publish their own things.

715
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:55,412
[SPEAKER_04]: But

716
00:56:57,193 --> 00:56:59,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually.

717
00:56:59,513 --> 00:57:01,434
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the money to sink into that either.

718
00:57:01,434 --> 00:57:05,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So like it's.

719
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:11,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you tried serving pizza at the restaurant or at your store to like, you know, pizza and games?

720
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:13,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's worked for Chuck E. Cheese.

721
00:57:13,616 --> 00:57:15,216
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, why not?

722
00:57:15,216 --> 00:57:15,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

723
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:17,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not just become a place instead of trying to sell?

724
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:19,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Just become an arcade.

725
00:57:19,137 --> 00:57:20,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade and pizza.

726
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:20,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like pivot.

727
00:57:20,998 --> 00:57:22,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely pivot.

728
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:23,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade pizza.

729
00:57:23,018 --> 00:57:23,298
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

730
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, for now, let's talk about other business decisions, Loki.

731
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:42,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, so, uh, you know, I've forgot that Gearbox was owned by the Embracer Group, which sucks because, you know, with their financial troubles that they're in, you know, what does that mean for Gearbox and their Borderlands series and whatnot?

732
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:55,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thankfully, you know, it is Gearbox and, uh, because of that, you know, and their partnerships with Take-Two Interactive in the past, they have now been, um, acquired by Take-Two Interactive.

733
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:09,222
[SPEAKER_04]: They paid $460 million to acquire them, whereas Embracer bought them originally for $1.3 billion.

734
00:58:09,222 --> 00:58:11,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes, a little bit of a sale there.

735
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:23,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so they're going to be... Embracer is going to still retain the rights to some parts of Gearbox's business.

736
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:26,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the games I think that they've published.

737
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:30,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Publishing rights to Remnant Franchise and the upcoming Hyper Light Breaker.

738
00:58:32,904 --> 00:58:49,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also going to publish some unannounced games as well, but everything's going to be folded into Take-Two Interactive, I'd imagine, under the 2K Games moniker as well, because, I mean, that's where they've been publishing a lot of their games previously.

739
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:55,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this kind of is a very logical sort of leap because, yeah, 2K has been doing a lot of publishing, so it's interesting.

740
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:58,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so cool.

741
00:58:58,037 --> 00:58:59,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to see that they're not going under.

742
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:00,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

743
00:59:00,598 --> 00:59:03,079
[SPEAKER_06]: That's with a lot of the Embracer related things lately.

744
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that's the common theme.

745
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm glad they're not going under.

746
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:06,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

747
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:08,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's for sure.

748
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:12,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, so I'm excited to see.

749
00:59:12,103 --> 00:59:17,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear they're working on Borderlands 4, so can't wait to find out more about that.

750
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:19,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, especially if they time it for the movie.

751
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:20,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

752
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:21,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

753
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:29,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, before we get to one of our favorite segments here at Orange Alliance Radio, I do have an important update about Twitch streaming culture.

754
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:36,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to announce you may no longer stream playing video games on your butt.

755
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:37,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this was a thing.

756
00:59:37,652 --> 00:59:39,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this was a thing that some streamers were doing.

757
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I only play video games is on my butt.

758
00:59:42,514 --> 00:59:44,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what you do at home is your own business.

759
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:51,518
[SPEAKER_06]: But some folks on Twitch were using green screen tricks to green screen like you wear a pair of green

760
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:59,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Briefs or panties or a bra or something and you can actually play a video game on your body part.

761
00:59:59,856 --> 01:00:14,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, Twitch is now officially prohibiting content that focuses on clothed intimate body parts, such as the buttocks, groin, or breasts for extended periods of time.

762
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:17,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch said that in a statement and it was immediately banned by Microsoft.

763
01:00:18,117 --> 01:00:19,258
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

764
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:23,263
[SPEAKER_06]: But Twitch did say that in a statement on March 29th.

765
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:26,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Our community guidelines are designed to help make Twitch a welcoming place.

766
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:26,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, look.

767
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:28,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

768
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:31,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like Twitch just, it is very interesting.

769
01:00:31,624 --> 01:00:38,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It just goes to show, draw a line and people, people like fucking people like fucking cats.

770
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:39,789
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they won't cross it.

771
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:41,650
[SPEAKER_06]: They will walk up to the line.

772
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,151
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll sniff around the line.

773
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:47,553
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll try to put a finger past the line or a butt past the line and see what they can get away with.

774
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:51,115
[SPEAKER_06]: People will try to get away with anything and everything.

775
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:55,737
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know, if they could, if they could cross that line, they would pogo stick right over it.

776
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:56,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

777
01:00:56,818 --> 01:00:57,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing.

778
01:00:57,579 --> 01:01:05,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the people that there are certain individuals on Twitch that are the ones pushing these metas, trying to skirt the line.

779
01:01:05,523 --> 01:01:07,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ban them.

780
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ban them already.

781
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what was this?

782
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, permanently ban them.

783
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:13,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Like- It's not gonna last.

784
01:01:13,748 --> 01:01:14,749
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna make another account.

785
01:01:15,894 --> 01:01:42,014
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a ban evasion and they get banned again because like for example Morgpie is one of the ones that's you always see her name when it's coming to these different metas trying to escape you know skirt by the rules and it's just the other reason I was on there is to try it I was just linked to something here oh I can't oh I was going to show it and then I realized that but that's a bad decision you will have to look at the link that TigerClaw dropped in chat because if I show this

786
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:43,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.

787
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:15,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

788
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just say ban these people because they're just going to keep coming back doing different things like this.

789
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:23,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, or ask yourself, should they be part?

790
01:02:23,342 --> 01:02:23,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

791
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:24,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this person partnered?

792
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:28,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming they are because they probably I'm sure it was easy for them to meet the criteria.

793
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

794
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:34,541
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, ask yourself, do you want to be partners with these types of streamers?

795
01:02:34,541 --> 01:02:40,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And look, I, I understand sex workers work, that's fine.

796
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:46,373
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but there are also websites there, there is very explicitly a competitor- Just making OnlyFans like everyone else does.

797
01:02:46,373 --> 01:02:47,854
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an Only- that's the thing.

798
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:50,477
[SPEAKER_04]: They're using Twitch to drive traffic to that.

799
01:02:50,477 --> 01:02:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole point.

800
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:59,225
[SPEAKER_06]: There is legitimately a competitor to Twitch where folks are encouraged to play video games and be naked.

801
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:02,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell you what it is, but you can go find it.

802
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:04,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard to find.

803
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:08,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Just take a stick and see if it points you in the right direction.

804
01:03:08,933 --> 01:03:09,914
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out there.

805
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:18,662
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Twitch wants to draw the line for advertiser dollars to keep the place in business, then that's what they have to do.

806
01:03:21,846 --> 01:03:24,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also encourage you not to put the website in chat.

807
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:32,574
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do whatever you want on Discord, I guess, within reason, but don't do it in chat, because I'm sure some of you are like, oh, Rob is talking about... I wouldn't do that.

808
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:33,254
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

809
01:03:33,254 --> 01:03:39,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob is talking about... Yes, I've suddenly become the cartoon strip Kathy.

810
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about... All right.

811
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:41,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

812
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:44,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Cathy's Retirement

813
01:04:04,184 --> 01:04:06,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck you, especially.

814
01:04:06,485 --> 01:04:07,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's my raise?

815
01:04:07,586 --> 01:04:10,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna go and be a political blah blah.

816
01:04:10,067 --> 01:04:11,068
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't.

817
01:04:11,068 --> 01:04:11,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

818
01:04:11,588 --> 01:04:13,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm thinking of that TikTok.

819
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:13,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Here I am.

820
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:15,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently this is Rob thinks of TikTok.

821
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,011
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm thinking of that old lady.

822
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:18,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's always like people repost it.

823
01:04:18,732 --> 01:04:26,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says like me reporting to work at Monday after my two hour nap or something is this old lady going, what?

824
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:27,577
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

825
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:28,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

826
01:04:31,524 --> 01:04:34,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that's me.

827
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:37,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Except I just think it really loudly.

828
01:04:37,046 --> 01:04:39,847
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

829
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:47,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's let's get to a orange right and chat says Kathy's resignation rated M for mature.

830
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,630
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

831
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Rated M for yeah, motherfucker.

832
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:51,972
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

833
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:57,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to a popular segment here on the show, which may or may not be rated M for mature.

834
01:04:57,294 --> 01:04:58,014
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic of the week.

835
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:16,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

836
01:05:16,301 --> 01:05:19,683
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

837
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:22,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic game this week?

838
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked Metamorphic Force.

839
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

840
01:05:27,598 --> 01:05:41,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an arcade game that was released by Konami in 1993 and it is one of Konami's last side-scrolling beat-em-ups along with Violent Storm.

841
01:05:41,165 --> 01:05:44,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is a lot like X-Men in the arcade.

842
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:48,148
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs on the same hardware as Mystic Warriors.

843
01:05:49,329 --> 01:06:03,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a basic recap of this game is that the evil King Deathshadow... I mean, that's not what you name your firstborn if you expect them to not be an evil emperor.

844
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:11,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The ruler of the empire of horror has risen from the dead to take over everything.

845
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:13,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And Athena's like, bitch, no.

846
01:06:13,793 --> 01:06:24,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So she summons the souls of four ancient guardians and charged them up with her mojo and sent them to stop the evil.

847
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can turn into different beasts.

848
01:06:28,543 --> 01:06:32,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of like altered beasts, but better.

849
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot better.

850
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:40,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So you play as Bon, who is a martial artist, and he turns into a fighting bull.

851
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: His beast form is a minotaur.

852
01:06:43,472 --> 01:06:46,453
[SPEAKER_02]: His guardian, sorry, is a fighting bull, so he turns into a minotaur.

853
01:06:46,453 --> 01:06:49,315
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Claude, who is a swordsman with a rapier.

854
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:51,576
[SPEAKER_02]: He turns into a werewolf.

855
01:06:51,576 --> 01:06:55,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, a fighter who's a boxer, turns into a werepanther.

856
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:59,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ivan, who is a hunter and wrestler, turns into a werebear.

857
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:09,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get into your beast mode and collect a power-up from golden statues.

858
01:07:09,178 --> 01:07:11,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And you eventually will get there.

859
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:20,743
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also this rodent creature that shows up and gives you a health item or a gold statue or something for your score.

860
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And they drop other power-ups.

861
01:07:24,464 --> 01:07:27,906
[SPEAKER_02]: If you attack the little ratman, then...

862
01:07:30,934 --> 01:07:37,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what he does if you attack him.

863
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:43,406
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll drop power-ups because he's all shook and runs away.

864
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:50,453
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get a statue when you're already in beast mode, you get a screen attack, which destroys everything on screen.

865
01:07:50,453 --> 01:07:55,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's collected during a boss fight, the boss is hit super hard and twice.

866
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:18,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have other anthropomorphic creatures that you fight, like frog folks, and lizards, and hedgehogs, and heffalump mans, and boars, and then your bosses, you have one called Cabrios the Ram Man, who looks like Baphomet, and you have Scythe, who is a flaming chicken man.

867
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fighting BBQ Chicken then?

868
01:08:20,711 --> 01:08:26,172
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a demoness who turns into a dragon.

869
01:08:26,172 --> 01:08:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a bunch of other stuff.

870
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:29,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a U.S.

871
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:32,334
[SPEAKER_02]: version and a Japanese version.

872
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:32,934
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S.

873
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:38,715
[SPEAKER_02]: version has a numeric life counter that also doubles as your timer.

874
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:43,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes down by one life point each tick, kind of like Gauntlet, right?

875
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:46,197
[SPEAKER_02]: The Japanese version uses a traditional health bar.

876
01:08:47,677 --> 01:08:59,841
[SPEAKER_02]: The 5th stage in the US has a boss rush, where you basically fight everybody until you get to the end boss, but in Japanese version you only fight at-level bosses.

877
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:02,142
[SPEAKER_02]: At-levels boss, sorry.

878
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:09,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the sprites have been really altered, like stained glass artwork in the elevator has been changed in the US one.

879
01:09:11,867 --> 01:09:26,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Machine in Japan Magazine listed Metamorphic Force on their September 15, 1993 issue as being the 17th most successful arcade unit of the month.

880
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:30,185
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places gave it really good ratings.

881
01:09:30,185 --> 01:09:31,867
[SPEAKER_02]: The soundtrack got released

882
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:42,759
[SPEAKER_02]: In the CDs collection, Konami Amusement Sounds 93 Autumn Edition.

883
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:48,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, one other thing about the game system.

884
01:09:50,265 --> 01:10:00,312
[SPEAKER_02]: that should be pointed out is that the model DD6 and model DD7 of the Bemani games originate from this game.

885
01:10:00,312 --> 01:10:10,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So the model DD6 is used on stage 2 and 7 boss battles, while model DD7 is used for stage 5's boss battle.

886
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:14,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, again, these went into the Bemani games.

887
01:10:15,137 --> 01:10:16,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

888
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is Metamorphic Force.

889
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:22,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty badass.

890
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:25,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the action is definitely a lot faster than Altered Beast.

891
01:10:25,998 --> 01:10:27,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I have more fun playing this.

892
01:10:29,599 --> 01:10:31,500
[SPEAKER_06]: How did I not really know about this game?

893
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I did play this.

894
01:10:32,681 --> 01:10:34,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe I did play this, but I forgot.

895
01:10:34,543 --> 01:10:36,264
[SPEAKER_02]: This was arcade only, remember?

896
01:10:36,264 --> 01:10:37,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I know.

897
01:10:37,185 --> 01:10:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, they used to have cool arcade games at Golf Land once upon a time.

898
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:49,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I played or like Scandia or one of the one of those, you know, you know, the arcade, maybe maybe even the bowling alley, what I recall.

899
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:53,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that I played this in an arcade in Dothan, Alabama at the old Tilt Arcade.

900
01:10:55,606 --> 01:10:58,167
[SPEAKER_06]: and Tilt Arcade takes me back.

901
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Some comments about this game in our chat.

902
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:03,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Rite says Konami sure like to make the US versions quarter suckers.

903
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:05,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, that's that's the business, right?

904
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:15,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Quest Buster says if I recall correctly, the animated look Konami used for this game was also reminiscent of that used in Gaiaopolis, Gaiaopolis, which also ran on the same hardware.

905
01:11:15,191 --> 01:11:17,231
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

906
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:17,571
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

907
01:11:17,571 --> 01:11:22,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there is your classic game of the week.

908
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:23,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Metamorphic Force.

909
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:24,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

910
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:25,683
Hmm, fun.

911
01:11:25,683 --> 01:11:27,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to check that one out.

912
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:41,575
[SPEAKER_06]: It also also kind of, you know, we had a little joke intro tonight about altered the game altered beast and this game kind of reminds me about that the whole like beast fighting type of thing is kind of a little bit I thought it was ironic you did that when I chose this game.

913
01:11:41,575 --> 01:11:41,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

914
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:45,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if you made them tighten with each other, but it's awfully funny.

915
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:45,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Unintended.

916
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:47,879
[SPEAKER_06]: There was supposed to be a different joke with that bumper there.

917
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:53,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just unintended that you know, because remember, the beginning of altered beast is rise from your grave.

918
01:11:53,263 --> 01:11:54,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Weiss, Omiyogwob

919
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw in chat says, I've never seen this arcade game in my life.

920
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:12,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice to hear about classic arcade games you never heard of because you never seen them around back in your days.

921
01:12:12,425 --> 01:12:12,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

922
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:16,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not not every game that existed always made its way to your local arcade.

923
01:12:16,768 --> 01:12:20,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So or it was there for like six weeks and then didn't do well and was gone.

924
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Namco would buy your arcade.

925
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

926
01:12:23,392 --> 01:12:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Or any of those types of things, too, for sure.

927
01:12:26,154 --> 01:12:27,374
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

928
01:12:27,374 --> 01:12:31,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's check out some other news in a segment we call Rapid Fire News, Loki.

929
01:12:32,455 --> 01:12:44,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we have news that Earthblade, the next game from Extremely Okay Games, the folks behind Celeste, it's been delayed.

930
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:49,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not coming out until, I think, next year now.

931
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:57,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was originally going to have a 2024 release window, but... Yeah, it's going to be a little bit later now.

932
01:12:57,047 --> 01:12:58,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

933
01:12:59,477 --> 01:12:59,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.

934
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:00,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

935
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Celeste was awesome.

936
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:08,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is a bit of funniness.

937
01:13:09,608 --> 01:13:36,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So I saw this on Twitter actually, but Katsuhiro Hirata of the Tekken franchise was asking fans, because I guess there's been this grassroots effort to try to get him to put Waffle House into the new Tekken game as an official stage, because they want to have people battling out of Waffle House.

938
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:36,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like,

939
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:40,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm only gonna ask this once.

940
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do people keep requesting the Waffle House?

941
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, he didn't understand the context behind it.

942
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:46,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hello, I am from a different country.

943
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:50,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you all obsessed with the idea of people battling at a Waffle House?

944
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:51,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, somebody has to explain the meme.

945
01:13:54,878 --> 01:13:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny, though.

946
01:13:55,659 --> 01:14:08,168
[SPEAKER_04]: The responses that were hilarious with like, you know, images of the woman like batting the chair out of the way as it flies through the air and just like, you know, essentially letting them know that, hey, well, it's because it's known for a lot of fighting.

947
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:10,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it'd be funny to play in any fighting game.

948
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,531
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be the advertising at Waffle House.

949
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a place to fight.

950
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:17,135
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, maybe it's not fighting off those urges.

951
01:14:17,135 --> 01:14:18,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

952
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:20,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Fighting your colon about 30 minutes later.

953
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:22,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

954
01:14:22,636 --> 01:14:26,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we, new, new dream game suggestion, I think.

955
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, hear me out.

956
01:14:28,842 --> 01:14:34,747
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a pilot like Backroads Battler.

957
01:14:34,747 --> 01:14:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you have like fighting happen, like at a Waffle House and then like at like a convenience store, you know, you're fighting like the people who try to jump on a robber, you know?

958
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:56,154
[SPEAKER_02]: or you have it at, uh, what's another place a lot of people get in fights at?

959
01:14:56,154 --> 01:14:57,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, post office?

960
01:14:57,595 --> 01:14:59,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the kid's little league game.

961
01:15:00,086 --> 01:15:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, no.

962
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:04,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Backstage at a kid's ballet.

963
01:15:04,188 --> 01:15:05,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Dance Moms.

964
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:05,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Dance Moms.

965
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:08,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Dance Moms area.

966
01:15:08,131 --> 01:15:14,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And we we just we just call this, you know, like I said, American Backroads Battler.

967
01:15:14,995 --> 01:15:17,076
[SPEAKER_06]: America Fight.

968
01:15:17,076 --> 01:15:18,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

969
01:15:18,036 --> 01:15:20,758
[SPEAKER_06]: SSU 100 Mountain Chats says Waffle House final destination.

970
01:15:20,758 --> 01:15:24,780
[SPEAKER_06]: No items, five stock.

971
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,301
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

972
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:25,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

973
01:15:27,067 --> 01:15:28,288
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire?

974
01:15:28,288 --> 01:15:38,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And there'll be level fatalities where like someone gets a waffle, not a waffle, well done, but like a hash brown smother coverage chunked, you know, land on them.

975
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,313
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

976
01:15:40,313 --> 01:15:44,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I think that would be be beautiful.

977
01:15:44,254 --> 01:15:45,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Take us to another story.

978
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:52,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how about some Capcom stuff?

979
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:58,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They have revealed the most popular games and comments from the fan survey that a bunch of us did.

980
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:01,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pissed!

981
01:16:01,338 --> 01:16:13,223
[SPEAKER_02]: But according to the graphic below, the biggest things that came up in votes, and this isn't like just titles and everything, it doesn't...

982
01:16:15,089 --> 01:16:31,892
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's like that it looks like it's more it almost looks like it's more of like a yeah it says it's a text my from a text mining tool so i think this is better it's one of those word clouds that corporations love just parses a bunch of text and yeah it's just a fucking word yeah

983
01:16:32,893 --> 01:16:36,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Veronica's on there, I would reckon that's from Code Veronica.

984
01:16:36,517 --> 01:16:44,164
[SPEAKER_02]: But the biggest names on there are Dino Crisis, Mega Man, Capcom, Remake, Game, and Thank You.

985
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:50,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going with Remake and Game respectively, we have Ace Attorney Remake and Resident Evil Game.

986
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:57,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Rival is on there, Street Fighter is, but it's like, it's really, they're schools.

987
01:16:57,454 --> 01:16:59,855
[SPEAKER_06]: They have schools in larger.

988
01:16:59,855 --> 01:17:03,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so maybe it's larger than Dragon's Dogma for what it's worth.

989
01:17:03,476 --> 01:17:04,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

990
01:17:04,937 --> 01:17:06,737
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to be louder, everybody.

991
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:08,178
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be louder.

992
01:17:08,178 --> 01:17:08,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

993
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:16,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get up on our little soapboxes and scream out to the masses.

994
01:17:16,321 --> 01:17:24,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more... Okay, well, DT says Rival Schools is bigger on their Japanese list, although I don't know why it wouldn't say Shiri to Justice Gakuen.

995
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:41,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, you know, we need to stand up and say, give us our rival school slash she beats Justice Gakuen and, uh, give us, uh, another Red Earth.

996
01:17:41,004 --> 01:17:42,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me cake and Cyberbots.

997
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me cake or give me rival schools.

998
01:17:47,269 --> 01:17:48,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, those are the three.

999
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:54,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I said what I said, because I want another Cyberbots, too, because don't you know, Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.

1000
01:17:57,003 --> 01:18:06,707
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, Hey Capcom, give us Rival Schools 3 or else we riot.

1001
01:18:06,707 --> 01:18:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's, that'll, that'll get it done.

1002
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:09,428
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

1003
01:18:09,428 --> 01:18:10,948
[SPEAKER_02]: New version, Riot Schools.

1004
01:18:10,948 --> 01:18:12,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no, we don't need that.

1005
01:18:12,309 --> 01:18:12,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

1006
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:19,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Complaining sometimes works because I always bitch and moan about how much I love the Commodore 64 and I want more crap.

1007
01:18:19,051 --> 01:18:20,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what's coming out more?

1008
01:18:20,692 --> 01:18:23,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Commodore 64 iconery crap.

1009
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:29,019
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the accessory maker 8bitdo is releasing a mechanical keyboard.

1010
01:18:29,019 --> 01:18:35,564
[SPEAKER_06]: They did one based on the NES and Famicom before, but this one is going to be based off the Commodore 64.

1011
01:18:35,564 --> 01:18:36,064
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1012
01:18:36,064 --> 01:18:41,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a mechanical keyboard, but it looks like, you guessed it, a Commodore 64 keyboard.

1013
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:44,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say, it does look kind of cool.

1014
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:47,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I would actually be able to use one of these like as my main keyboard,

1015
01:18:48,214 --> 01:18:49,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it is pretty badass.

1016
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:54,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love that in this mock photo somebody took, they actually have like a game playing on a Commodore monitor.

1017
01:18:54,816 --> 01:18:59,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I don't know for what like actual use I would have for this keyboard, but I think it does look really cool.

1018
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:01,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1019
01:19:01,077 --> 01:19:04,198
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a USB, Bluetooth.

1020
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:09,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost $109.99 and will ship on May 26, 2024.

1021
01:19:09,219 --> 01:19:11,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Not gonna lie, I still kind of want one.

1022
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I still kind of want one.

1023
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe I can have it downstairs with the Xbox.

1024
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:18,690
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a thought.

1025
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,631
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a thought.

1026
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,011
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1027
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:22,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Just just what I need to be doing.

1028
01:19:22,312 --> 01:19:24,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Justifying stupid purchases right now.

1029
01:19:24,652 --> 01:19:25,473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1030
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:31,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out games that are coming out real soon, if anything.

1031
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:33,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's... Not a lot.

1032
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the slow time of the year.

1033
01:19:35,756 --> 01:19:45,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a couple of things coming up this week, starting with Freedom Planet 2 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1034
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:45,760
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gap.

1035
01:19:47,203 --> 01:19:47,643
[SPEAKER_04]: on YouTube.

1036
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,182
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it apparently is.

1037
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that.

1038
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:20,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Biomorph on PC.

1039
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:20,992
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

1040
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:25,499
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, going to Japan and checking out the releases there.

1041
01:20:25,499 --> 01:20:30,603
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Switch this week, we have on April the 4th, Expeditions, a Mudrunner game.

1042
01:20:30,603 --> 01:20:32,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the only release coming out in Japan this week.

1043
01:20:32,824 --> 01:20:34,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is a Mudrunner?

1044
01:20:34,445 --> 01:20:39,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those like, you know, power truck things that goes through the mud, you know, kicks dirt everywhere.

1045
01:20:39,629 --> 01:20:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, dirt rally.

1046
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:43,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those type of games.

1047
01:20:43,011 --> 01:20:46,553
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is the only release on the Switch this week.

1048
01:20:46,553 --> 01:20:50,076
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 5, you could also check out Expeditions, a Mudrunner game.

1049
01:20:50,436 --> 01:20:51,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's nothing.

1050
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:51,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing at all.

1051
01:21:20,236 --> 01:21:21,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing at all.

1052
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1053
01:21:21,957 --> 01:21:22,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the music play with it?

1054
01:21:22,977 --> 01:21:26,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this week, you can maybe catch up on your fucking backlog.

1055
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,480
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1056
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,021
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

1057
01:21:29,021 --> 01:21:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too busy playing other games.

1058
01:21:30,642 --> 01:21:31,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1059
01:21:31,482 --> 01:21:31,882
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1060
01:21:31,882 --> 01:21:32,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Catching up on your backlog.

1061
01:21:32,723 --> 01:21:37,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still in the committed relationship with the ending credits of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

1062
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:43,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have to start Final Fantasy VII Rebirth because I keep getting distracted by shiny things.

1063
01:21:43,308 --> 01:21:44,709
[SPEAKER_06]: The eternal struggle.

1064
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:47,951
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these days I'll play the Mario RPG remake that I bought too and never played.

1065
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:50,576
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on.

1066
01:21:50,576 --> 01:21:54,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, speaking of games and people's backlog, Loki, I think you have one more story for us.

1067
01:21:55,717 --> 01:22:11,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's in my backlog because I don't own a PlayStation 5, but apparently there's still talk saying that even though, you know, we know that Final Fantasy 16 is coming to PC, that might not be the end of it.

1068
01:22:11,224 --> 01:22:19,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to Yoshida, basically said it's not over in the sense that we have the PC version.

1069
01:22:19,808 --> 01:22:24,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the PC version is released, we're thinking about hopefully moving to other platforms as well.

1070
01:22:26,445 --> 01:22:29,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder what other platforms that could be.

1071
01:22:29,687 --> 01:22:32,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time for the Ouija of the Shine.

1072
01:22:32,128 --> 01:22:37,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's saying Xbox, but I really think it's Nintendo's Switch successor.

1073
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:40,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like Nintendo's Switch successor will see the game before Xbox does.

1074
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:41,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

1075
01:22:41,354 --> 01:22:42,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything's possible.

1076
01:22:42,315 --> 01:22:45,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that like Microsoft and Final Fantasy don't get along.

1077
01:22:45,196 --> 01:22:49,959
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there's a lot of people on Microsoft's platform that wishes they would put out more Final Fantasy games.

1078
01:22:49,959 --> 01:22:52,401
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the Pixel remasters never came out on Xbox.

1079
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:57,963
[SPEAKER_06]: and that has a lot of people heated because there's no reason there that should there's no reason that should be the case.

1080
01:22:57,963 --> 01:23:00,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Those pixel remasters are on fucking phones.

1081
01:23:00,303 --> 01:23:03,044
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on phones, Steam, PlayStation.

1082
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:04,465
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not on Xbox.

1083
01:23:04,465 --> 01:23:05,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1084
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:06,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody's guess.

1085
01:23:06,165 --> 01:23:06,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It's silly.

1086
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:07,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1087
01:23:07,225 --> 01:23:09,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So it almost makes you wonder like this.

1088
01:23:09,126 --> 01:23:13,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all these fucking hoops with Final Fantasy 14, including what we talked about at the top of the show.

1089
01:23:13,808 --> 01:23:18,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes people go like, seriously, does Microsoft have a fucking problem with Final Fantasy or something?

1090
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:20,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't.

1091
01:23:20,332 --> 01:23:24,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Sony's probably paid the money to be exclusive.

1092
01:23:24,354 --> 01:23:25,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why.

1093
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:26,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1094
01:23:26,014 --> 01:23:32,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I'm not sure how much more Final Fantasy 16 copies are going to sell after this new DLC comes out pretty soon.

1095
01:23:32,858 --> 01:23:34,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1096
01:23:34,338 --> 01:23:39,861
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I guess there'll still be like a game of the year edition that has it all bundled up in one, but.

1097
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:41,642
[SPEAKER_06]: After that, I don't know.

1098
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:41,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

1099
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:44,746
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, that is all the slotted news we had tonight.

1100
01:23:44,746 --> 01:23:51,234
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was a little, we had some big stories, but it was a little bit of a slower week just because of, you know, everything that's going on.

1101
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:56,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think with the end of the fiscal quarter, spring break, et cetera, et cetera, and all of that.

1102
01:23:56,841 --> 01:23:59,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all are still talking about Waffle House and Chad?

1103
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:02,411
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1104
01:24:19,383 --> 01:24:22,526
[SPEAKER_06]: like Tucson, Arizona, which I've actually been to it's right by the airport.

1105
01:24:22,526 --> 01:24:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one of the suburbs of Phoenix might technically be closer in miles, but that's about the closest waffle because I don't think there's any of them on the West.

1106
01:24:29,813 --> 01:24:32,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're in Oregon, Washington.

1107
01:24:32,015 --> 01:24:33,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're in Nevada either.

1108
01:24:33,357 --> 01:24:37,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think I've seen any in Idaho when I went up there and drove to there.

1109
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like they're not really on the West Coast at all except for Arizona.

1110
01:24:42,485 --> 01:24:43,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway,

1111
01:24:45,876 --> 01:24:54,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I only eat Waffle House when I go to Dragon Con and even then I'm like, like it was fun the first couple times but even now I'm like, okay, I'm, I'm over it.

1112
01:24:54,187 --> 01:24:56,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's, it's a meme at this point.

1113
01:24:56,089 --> 01:24:57,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't, I don't need to go.

1114
01:24:57,591 --> 01:24:59,674
[SPEAKER_06]: There's much, much better places I'd rather go.

1115
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:06,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want to open it up to potentially your calls over on our discord server.

1116
01:25:06,858 --> 01:25:10,481
[SPEAKER_06]: vognetwork.com slash discord is the place to give us a call.

1117
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:16,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you have random questions in our chat, we'll always take those over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

1118
01:25:16,247 --> 01:25:19,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I will punt it over to Loki to check in and see if we have any last minute stories.

1119
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: uh there's just a rumor that 2k is going to announce their fifa game coming tuesday or they're gonna announce it on tuesday it's supposed to be called fifa 2k fc so we'll see we'll see that actually happens we'll see what happens um one small piece of news i know that came up this week because i follow this game is no man's sky you know how i was bitching about the expedition is ending too early do they have a new patch coming out or something well guess what

1120
01:25:49,252 --> 01:25:51,013
[SPEAKER_06]: A new patch came out this week for No Man's Sky.

1121
01:25:51,013 --> 01:25:52,834
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer is yes, it is.

1122
01:25:52,834 --> 01:25:57,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And it takes a feature that a lot of people really liked about Starfield.

1123
01:25:57,597 --> 01:26:06,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure it was intended to take a feature from Starfield, but it's basically the customizing the ships and building your ships rather than usually had to rely on the algorithm to kind of get you a good ship.

1124
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:10,884
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they have a little bit more of a robust ship building system in the game.

1125
01:26:10,884 --> 01:26:12,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it since they did the patch.

1126
01:26:12,445 --> 01:26:14,446
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm speaking a little bit generally.

1127
01:26:14,446 --> 01:26:17,188
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know they also finally made algorithmic

1128
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:27,792
[SPEAKER_06]: updated space stations, which is kind of cool because every space station kind of looks the same, which I did like because you always know, okay, run to the left and you're going to find the bag upgrade.

1129
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:32,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, unless you were in a pirate space station, every space station relatively looked the same.

1130
01:26:32,474 --> 01:26:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So now those are being procedurally generated a little bit as well, which is kind of cool.

1131
01:26:36,035 --> 01:26:40,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It brings a little more uniqueness to each system in the game.

1132
01:26:40,336 --> 01:26:40,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1133
01:26:41,997 --> 01:27:09,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw this article out there while I was doing uh I was digging up stuff for tonight's show and somebody wrote an article about why uh why No Man's Sky is better than Starfield at this point with this with this latest patch it says they've basically taken every feature that made Starfield interesting and it's in No Man's Sky which I I don't know I feel I feel bad-ish for Starfield because I don't want to hate on that game but it didn't click for me the way that No Man's Sky does I don't know

1134
01:27:10,049 --> 01:27:16,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, SJ100Matt is asking in our chat, did you see the SpotPass Fan Archive project that's going on?

1135
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:20,552
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently there is this website you can access on GitHub.

1136
01:27:20,552 --> 01:27:26,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a GitHub server called, or sorry, a GitHub site called SpotPass Archive.

1137
01:27:26,113 --> 01:27:39,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently what this site is doing is you can actually dump a database from your system to help various network revival services in preserving SpotPass content.

1138
01:27:39,017 --> 01:27:39,837
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of interesting.

1139
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:49,042
[SPEAKER_06]: including Mario Kart 7 for ghost data, StreetPass, the puzzle pieces and all of that, Pokemon games for events and stuff.

1140
01:27:49,042 --> 01:27:51,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know, New Super Mario Brothers 2, I forgot about that.

1141
01:27:51,824 --> 01:27:52,965
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, there was all this.

1142
01:27:52,965 --> 01:27:57,649
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently they are collecting 3DS dumps and Wii U dumps.

1143
01:27:57,649 --> 01:28:00,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss Swapnote, man.

1144
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:00,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1145
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:05,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, um, but yeah, that's a whole thing that's happening on GitHub, which is kind of neat.

1146
01:28:05,455 --> 01:28:13,221
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, yeah, leave it, leave it to the fans, the archivists, these folks that I know Nintendo doesn't like, but guess what?

1147
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:17,145
[SPEAKER_06]: When you pull the plug on your services, this is how people get it to live on.

1148
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:19,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So some people are going to go ahead.

1149
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:20,908
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a will, there's a way.

1150
01:28:20,908 --> 01:28:21,849
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1151
01:28:21,849 --> 01:28:23,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are pissed.

1152
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:26,893
[SPEAKER_06]: They're never going to collect every puzzle piece in the street pass.

1153
01:28:26,893 --> 01:28:28,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's why this happens.

1154
01:28:28,915 --> 01:28:29,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1155
01:28:30,444 --> 01:28:32,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, all right.

1156
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:34,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess that about wraps up for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

1157
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:40,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was a shorter show tonight, but it is a multitude of holidays here in the States and so forth, and a little bit of a slower news week.

1158
01:28:40,852 --> 01:28:45,196
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will be back next week, if you can believe it, episode number 999 of our show.

1159
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:53,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And in two weeks, we hit 1,000 weekly episodes of this show, which is quite a landmark.

1160
01:28:53,102 --> 01:28:55,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to all of you for getting along to the riots.

1161
01:28:55,604 --> 01:28:56,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild to think about.

1162
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:57,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

1163
01:28:58,946 --> 01:29:09,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody also said to me today, actually it was Jason, our voiceover guy, sent this to me in a text and he said, did you know today is also the 25th anniversary of The Matrix coming out in theaters?

1164
01:29:09,191 --> 01:29:12,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I saw that movie in the theater twice.

1165
01:29:12,713 --> 01:29:13,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling very old right now.

1166
01:29:13,913 --> 01:29:17,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling very attacked.

1167
01:29:17,735 --> 01:29:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're cool.

1168
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:19,896
[SPEAKER_06]: We're cooler.

1169
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know.

1170
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:21,397
[SPEAKER_06]: We're super cool.

1171
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:21,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1172
01:29:22,908 --> 01:29:25,290
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1173
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:42,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't finish, like, all the things, but they did it to where you don't have to do them all to unlock all of the items.

1174
01:29:42,593 --> 01:29:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to finish the tomes.

1175
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.

1176
01:29:46,616 --> 01:29:53,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, at least, like, go through a few of both sides, you know.

1177
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was fun.

1178
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:58,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

1179
01:29:58,803 --> 01:30:00,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Fact check all the things.

1180
01:30:00,524 --> 01:30:01,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

1181
01:30:01,525 --> 01:30:04,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, yeah, you'll be a better person for it.

1182
01:30:05,842 --> 01:30:09,564
[SPEAKER_02]: and be critical of what you love.

1183
01:30:09,564 --> 01:30:10,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's us.

1184
01:30:10,604 --> 01:30:12,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Never be critical of us.

1185
01:30:12,345 --> 01:30:15,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Be constructively critical because sometimes complaining is a gift.

1186
01:30:15,687 --> 01:30:16,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1187
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:21,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Constructive criticism is fine, but never about sound problems that don't make the podcast feed.

1188
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:24,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Never about that.

1189
01:30:24,131 --> 01:30:29,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Email this directly to rob at rob.rob.

1190
01:30:29,713 --> 01:30:30,113
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:30:30,113 --> 01:30:31,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good stream, DarkSakura.

1194
01:30:53,677 --> 01:30:56,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So follow me on social media to hear all about them because I always promote them.

[SPEAKER_06]: I don't post there as much.

1200
01:31:08,249 --> 01:31:09,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on threads technically.

1201
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:10,971
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Instagram,
