9893	14656	According to their studio founder, Larian Studios is done with Baldur's Gate, the entire series.
14656	17958	No Baldur's Gate 4, no Baldur's Gate 3 expansions, fully done.
17958	19459	What might happen in 10 years?
19459	24303	Sven has a change of heart, private equity buys Larian Studios and revives it under someone else's direction?
24303	27385	Or a spiritual successor made from an ex-studio employee?
27385	29246	This is the time as a flat circle intro.
29246	34329	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somerson, Loki, to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34329	36631	Starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
38926	41546	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41546	47047	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47047	58949	It is Orange Lounge Radio back live once again with episode number 997 of our show for tonight, March 24th, 2024.
58949	60070	My name is Rob Roberts.
60070	64590	I'm here with you every week, joined by my co-hosts over there in that corner.
64590	67851	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70697	72718	Greetings and salivations.
72718	77541	How are you doing this fine Sunday evening?
77541	78522	Sleepier.
78522	81304	Yeah, I just like, I didn't sleep enough.
81304	83505	I was playing video games.
83505	86647	And it's been kind of a busy time.
86647	88789	You know, I remember when that was the thing.
88789	91230	That was the line I used when I was 18.
91230	93092	And you're how old now, Miss Sakura?
97984	99745	Your business.
99745	101406	And my birthday is not even yet.
101406	102886	So.
102886	103907	It's coming up, though.
103907	104687	Coming up, though.
104687	109789	The week after we hit 1000 episodes, believe it or not.
109789	112490	And it will be hopefully quite the gathering.
112490	116512	I would love for all of my friends to come celebrate with me.
116512	117032	All right.
117032	117713	Well, let's.
117713	118953	It's online.
118953	119914	You can all come play with me.
121387	127848	Uh, I'll, I'll be there, but after work, cause unfortunately, uh, I can't use that as an excuse to get out of work, but we'll see.
127848	128908	All right.
128908	130829	Uh, but also- I don't know, my birthday is a holiday.
130829	133049	You should just be like, it's DarkSakura's birthday.
133049	134449	I have the day off.
134449	137730	It's a holiday in my religion.
137730	139270	Well, I don't know.
139270	142591	I don't know if my, my, uh, my boss observes that, but we'll see.
142591	142851	All right.
142851	146131	Anyway, uh, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
146131	147331	Hey, Loki.
147331	147852	Hello.
147852	149252	How are you doing?
149252	149992	I'm doing okay.
149992	150232	Yeah.
151350	153352	Uh, is your birthday gonna be a holiday too?
153352	157634	I mean, it always is.
157634	157995	Kind of.
157995	158455	Memorial.
159918	164381	I just realized like after those words left my mouth, I was like, actually, that might be a really bad joke.
164381	165402	No, no, they don't.
165402	166583	They don't make it a holiday.
166583	168324	Unfortunately, it's just a memorial.
168324	171287	Everyone gets depressed on your birthday.
171287	172948	Everyone gets depressed on your birthday.
172948	173788	Yeah.
173788	178592	So well, hopefully that can bring you a little bit of joy in six months.
178592	179753	You still got some time, though.
179753	180754	You still got a little bit of time.
181334	182115	So yeah.
182115	183476	All right.
183476	187879	I see the game playing behind you tonight.
187879	188280	I don't.
188280	190201	Is it like Wave Race on?
190201	192403	No, it can't be Wave Race because it looks like PS2.
192403	193444	Wave Race.
193444	194485	I don't know.
194485	195065	What is it?
195065	196346	That's not what that is.
196346	197467	Like Jet Moto or something.
197467	199569	It looks like Wave Race.
199569	201651	It is like Jet Moto.
201651	203432	It's Jet Moto 2, actually.
203432	203492	Aha!
204753	206474	I never really played those games to be honest.
206474	208075	Do not step to my knowledge, Rob.
208075	208776	It was great.
208776	211577	I've never played this game in my life.
211577	216380	They needed to bring it back because it was a really fun racing series.
216380	219482	It was like flying jet skis, basically.
219482	220563	Rocket jet skis.
220563	222784	Yeah, it's jet skis that don't really go on water.
222784	224265	They're on land.
224265	224965	That doesn't make any sense.
224965	225906	They do sometimes.
225906	229288	Yeah, they can go on water, but they can also hover on land.
229288	233271	That's like the duck boat in Seattle.
233271	233571	Anyway.
234301	239725	Alright, let's get into some of the gaming news for the week.
239725	246430	And yeah, we're gonna start off with this is something that's kind of been going around the entire industry this week.
246430	249372	Loki, I don't know if you want to do this or you want me to do it.
249372	250453	This story.
250453	252454	I'm not very familiar with this, but sure.
252454	253435	No, I can.
253435	254215	Okay, I can read it.
254215	254656	Go for it.
255701	264571	The Kotaku editor-in-chief has exited the company due to the parent company's new guide directive.
264571	269195	So Jen Glennon has resigned after five months in her role.
269195	275682	And apparently this is due to a new editorial direction from GeoMedia.
275682	277724	I wonder what that direction is.
279974	296085	Basically, it says, I firmly believe that the decision to invert Kotaku's editorial strategy to deprioritize news in favor of guides is fundamentally misguided given its current infrastructure of the site.
296085	307913	This decision is directly contradicted by months of traffic data and shows an astonishing disregard for the livelihoods of the remaining writers and editors who work for Kotaku.
308613	310335	Uh, yeah, they'll just get AI to do it.
310335	311356	It's fine.
311356	318562	I mean, well, but it's going to be a little hard for AI to write guides for games that just came out because there's nothing for the AI to steal for.
318562	319603	I mean, learn from.
319603	320604	Yeah, absolutely.
320604	325889	There's stuff that for them to steal from, like all the other guides out there, they'll just rip from them.
325889	328191	But yeah, it's annoying.
328191	333696	So you mean guides for older games where the content does exist, not guides for newer games?
334545	336546	or Listicles and that kind of nonsense.
336546	338526	You know, they do this all the time.
338526	340707	Um, you know, it's, hey, hey.
340707	343768	How well does this work for others?
343768	349050	I mean, they feel it's a success, the new, the parent company.
349050	354692	Um, they're probably looking to drive engagement to these articles, Evergreen or something like that.
354692	356833	Um, I don't know.
356833	359153	I don't go to Kotaku for guides.
359153	360054	That's for sure.
360054	363095	So strike one right there, I guess.
363095	363855	I mean, I don't,
365182	366563	This is an industry wide issue.
381038	386982	This is weird because, you know, when you look at it for what face value is, do guides get a lot of hits?
386982	388183	Yes, they do.
388183	389804	Have I used guides?
389804	390985	Yeah, of course.
390985	402113	Like, you know, I can't think of how many times I've been out there and I've Googled, you know, I'm out there playing Pokemon Go and I don't know Pokemon as well as a Shane or even like a Mike Deft or somebody in our chat that plays Pokemon all the time.
402433	402773	and so on.
432473	448907	one of the first things on there but like some of these guides are just kind of dumb like they're not guides they're just it's it's it's call it a guide would be well just very disingenuous it's it's it's a listicle is what it is or it's nine things you it's something no one would type into google
450228	450649	Really?
450649	465923	Like, I'm not gonna type in 9 things to know before starting Rise of the Ronin, or 18 things to know before starting Dragon's Dogma 2, or how about Final Fantasy VII's Rebirth, best materia for dealing magic damage, like... What should I do before starting Dragon Dogmas 2?
465923	467545	That's... that's what they're typing.
467905	482382	refund your game done there you go that's what you do okay because it's trash fifth dream points out the reader view that's a really good point uh it doesn't always work but you're right i should remember it for some of those sites uh that tend to have you know just loaded up with all the garbage
483462	494245	And over in our chat, of course, again, I should mention, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
494245	501807	And Bobby's actually in our chat saying, nobody goes to Kotaku for guides, but they go to Google for guides, and Kotaku wants to be on the top of the Google search results.
502407	503067	Therein is the problem.
503067	519092	Look, I understand a little bit superficially anyway, the superficial layer of guides are always going to get hits because people are going to start games late or the game is going to have life forever like a Pokemon game would.
519092	526554	People are new to those games every day or a Zelda or a lot of Nintendo properties, people are visiting those games for the first time every day.
526554	528314	So those guides are going to have a long life.
528314	530555	So at a superficial level, I understand.
531155	531536	DarkSakura
543629	546330	We want to be at the top of the Google search results.
546330	549270	I did What to Know, Dragon's Dogma 2.
549270	555372	And the first thing I get is I get multiple posts on Dragon's Dogma.
555372	560874	They've got RPG forums or RPG Watch, several YouTube videos, IGN.
562794	581332	more youtube videos, pc games n, kotaku is like way down in there, and gamespot they're all doing this so like if they're all do all of these companies are doing this you're not unique in this this thing and and these guides if you will are always those
581972	590701	The slideshow articles, you know what I'm talking about where it's like it's a list and it's a slideshow that you have to click through the list and then there's a ton of ads thrown in there.
590701	604214	It is the same trash that is literally all over the internet and a lot of it nowadays is AI generated so you know that if that's what they're looking for and they need editors to do it
606070	606430	DarkSakura
624011	626974	I mean, probably YouTube will do it better anyways.
626974	633001	That's the whole thing I was gonna say is that, you know, for as much as we're talking about this particular website, it is the exact same thing over on YouTube.
633001	635303	It is the exact same thing over on YouTube.
635303	642812	And it right on down to the stuff that tends to get a lot of hits on YouTube are the evergreen guide type questions.
642812	645595	And then of course, you get a video that shows you how to do it after
646115	674330	four or five minutes of all of this setup and background where they tell you the background everything and why are they doing that they're trying to increase increase the watch minutes because that's a stat that goes into advertising you know revenue eligibility and all this stuff on YouTube that's why a question that could be answered in fucking 30 seconds is a 10 minute video on YouTube and people do this all the time and it's the and it's the exact same thing those videos tend to get more hits because people that's what people are searching on YouTube and so forth um
675492	681097	But what's interesting is that look at what's successful on YouTube in the non-evergreen space.
681097	684199	You create a sense of, well, there's kind of two things.
684199	695309	Shock content or, you know, unfortunately things that are extreme viewpoints, which is a whole other issue and stuff that creates a sense of brand loyalty, basically.
695309	695489	And I,
697370	710121	I am sad to hear that Kotaku and a lot of other websites out there have no interest in kind of creating that sort of brand loyalty anymore through well-written, well-researched articles and so forth.
710121	721090	But this is such a complicated issue because as much as I sit here and go, that's a very valuable thing to have, I also completely realize that the social media world we live in has ruined a lot of that.
721650	739607	no more is there a website to do an article about this news event that happened when somebody's tweeting about it in 200 characters or less or whatever social media you use Facebook same thing even fucking your tick tock and Instagram all of it like it's have hmm
740686	751533	I have a really tangible example of how just the mindset of the masses has turned when it comes to reading or news or any sort of delivery of information.
751533	755736	And that's look at old Apple computer ads.
755736	758998	How they were all, they showed you the product.
758998	767083	It had, you know, the nice big logo and several paragraphs of information about the thing they were advertising.
767083	768884	All set in Adobe Garamond Pro.
770532	772374	Now look at your ads.
772374	773334	Big picture, one word.
789229	798254	You know, look at your ads, you know, you would get so much information, you know, like call this number, do this thing, blah, blah, blah.
798254	803357	And now it's just like face QR code.
803357	812403	You know, I mean, I really I really did like how informative those iPod commercials were with the people dancing in the chords for their headphones.
812403	814424	I'm not talking about commercials.
814424	815665	I'm talking about print ads.
817180	819042	Who looks at print ads?
819042	820943	And that's a whole other problem, right?
820943	825226	Well, that's the thing is, web apps technically count as a print ad.
825226	829330	It's roughly the same equivalent just in digital form.
829330	832452	It is a solitary, stationary thing.
832452	839297	But it goes back into, you know, there was so much text and so much information to look at.
839297	842179	And now it's, here's your big ad.
842179	845322	It has to catch your attention within a second.
846613	847994	Ask to get the point across.
847994	864710	And I honestly think, and we went over some of this when I was in graphic design school, that there is a change in psychology where the mind today is processing information at a so much faster speed because we've been acclimatized to it.
866218	874540	And that's now what media is catering to, is that fast, bite-sized, digestible piece of information.
874540	883301	You know, how much information can we convey, you know, without you having to read several paragraphs worth of stuff?
883301	888242	And on top of that, too, we're having people, you know, forgetting entire methods of writing.
888242	890903	The same thing that's happening in Japan with writing kanji.
890903	893283	People were just letting their text autofill.
894644	898107	We're doing a lot of the same here.
898107	906894	But going back to it, you know, people are typing and they're forgetting skills in writing.
906894	913840	People are losing ability to think critically if the information is presented to them in a quick and easy and makes sense format.
913840	915241	They don't fact check.
915241	918423	They don't know if there's anything to substantiate it.
918423	921306	Which is, I'd say, 90% of Twitter these days.
923522	939309	But a lot of it, every, and Bobby is correct that it wasn't just Apple, but I'm saying in general, those are the ones you can probably find the easiest examples of, or that might stick out in the memory a little bit more for people.
939309	942030	But we are...
943061	950426	We are given the information that people want us to think at the right time.
950426	953708	And that's, I think, where the danger lies.
953708	968319	I think that... I mean, I'm going to sound like, you know, the old guy on the lawn shaking his cane to get off the lawn and yelling at clouds, but... What did clouds do to you?
968319	968779	Evil said it.
970648	978698	People would rather follow the opinions of those they think are popular than form their own because we don't want to think.
978698	982563	We are now conditioned not to think.
982563	986788	We're conditioned to take the information at a glance and if it's inconvenient, boohoo.
987589	991271	and algorithms are just playing into all of that.
991271	996934	All of that, what you just said, which in my opinion, you know, and I've I've said this for a while, is what makes Twitter so damn dangerous.
996934	1001016	And I would love nothing more than to see that site go down tomorrow permanently.
1001016	1005118	But, you know, I realize some people are just going to say, oh, you're just a hater, robber or whatever.
1005118	1007940	It's just I I don't know.
1007940	1012122	I don't think a lot of that, like nothing would make me happier than for Twitter to be gone tomorrow.
1012122	1013103	Nothing would make me happier.
1013823	1021149	And honestly, I think some of these sorts of trends about, you know, we're because we're sitting here talking about this.
1021149	1025913	And really, like, this is one of the few times where I'm just sitting here going, yeah, it sucks.
1025913	1027655	I don't know what we can do about it.
1027655	1035261	This was going to be a colossal shift in how we seek out information and how we parse information for this situation to change.
1036602	1045188	I just don't see how how this changes and this sucks because I feel like is it the right call for Kotaku to make money?
1045188	1045688	Maybe.
1045688	1046008	I don't know.
1046008	1052913	I'm not in finance, but I can see superficially that, yeah, it probably leans into them getting more hits and influencing Google search results.
1052913	1060658	Is it ethically the right thing to do for them to have hired these writers that wanted to come in and work for a gaming website that everybody knew about?
1060658	1062519	And is it ethically the right thing?
1062519	1063419	Absolutely not.
1063419	1064060	And that sucks.
1064580	1066961	and props to the editor-in-chief for doing what they did.
1066961	1069321	Who cares about ethics when there's money?
1069321	1070522	Bingo.
1070522	1071102	Bingo.
1071102	1072022	Right.
1072022	1077383	But I'm, you know, I'm also starting to see, this is a semi-prediction.
1077383	1079544	It may or may not happen.
1079544	1091007	And I think we're going to start seeing a new trend in labor laws that are going to try to help preserve jobs for the human element.
1091007	1091527	You know what I mean?
1091527	1091847	Yeah.
1092447	1106500	that, you know, like so and such percent of the workforce must be be human and not AI and must be able to fill these functions and then work hours, et cetera.
1106500	1114888	They're already talking about lowering us to a 32 hour a week thing, which honestly, I don't think would be bad as long as our income stays the same.
1114888	1115108	But
1116522	1137575	But it's just, there's another thing too, and this is a little bit of a me thing, is that I've been very interested in going back and finishing my sociology degree and interspacing it with trends on the internet and communities and see how we look at our communities with the same sort of psychological
1140104	1147748	attachment, that might not be the best word, of going to hang out with your friends in real life, you know what I mean?
1147748	1158273	It's like, oh, I'm, you know, like, if I say, oh, I'm gonna go hang out my friend stream, I say it like I'm gonna go hang out with my friend, you know?
1158273	1166197	It's, it's a change in overall psychology with, with how we're wired today.
1167249	1178412	and Rob, Loki, you know, Bobby, you know, people who are, I would say, like this late Gen X or early, what was that?
1178412	1179052	Gen Y?
1179052	1179732	Millennial?
1179732	1180253	Whatever.
1180253	1181873	Millennial.
1181873	1183253	The Xennial crowd.
1183253	1184694	I'll say the Xennial crowd.
1184694	1187835	I hate it, but I'm using it.
1187835	1193196	We all grew up when the first computers were in their infancy.
1194815	1209382	We're a very unique generation with all of this because we have gone from the days where we saw things explained and things spelled out and we had to research and we had to use a freaking encyclopedia and we had to know how to think critically.
1209382	1213484	We played outside and we came in and played our Nintendos, you know.
1213484	1218427	We grew up with all of this as it grew up.
1219507	1227532	And I think that this puts us in a unique position to understand where that transition was happening and to have seen it change and participated in it.
1227532	1228292	Makes sense?
1228292	1229933	Yeah.
1229933	1247023	And so I think that more than anything, I think that that puts us in exactly the unique position as well as being able to suggest not necessarily how to combat it, but how to
1249215	1250736	What's the word I'm thinking of?
1250736	1252076	Lessen the blow.
1252076	1253477	I can't make my words happen right now.
1253477	1254457	I'm having a moment.
1254457	1274786	Well, and not to take this too far to a weird place, but to your point, you know, when you talk about how can change actually happen, we are also probably the most under-represented generation, racially, when you talk about politics, because there's a certain other generation that won't get out of politics.
1276667	1288301	But the other thing, too, is that we actually have also a very special place in the land of politics because we were new voters right around the era of Rock the Vote.
1288301	1289283	Remember?
1289283	1290905	Voter P. Diddy will kill you.
1290905	1292567	That was a little later, but still, you know.
1293860	1299024	Or, you know, that pretty much came up with, I'd say, the Clinton election for Bill Clinton.
1299024	1301045	But the MTV voting campaign.
1301045	1301725	Absolutely.
1301725	1302166	Absolutely.
1302166	1306529	But we had a relatively younger candidate who played sax on TV.
1306529	1307469	I was like, I'm voting for him.
1307469	1308090	He plays sax.
1308090	1308990	I play sax.
1308990	1309451	No, I'm kidding.
1310211	1324055	But, you know, we had that point where they were realizing much more the value of the younger voter in that by shaping what we did now, we would be setting a precedence for the future.
1324055	1332638	And I don't really remember seeing the kind of marketing made to younger voters as what I've seen since my late teens and up.
1334013	1343675	Anyway, you know, yes, I mean, but that's also playing into it is that now we have we have the age behind us.
1343675	1347776	We we can all run for president if we wanted to.
1347776	1350396	Most of us, but but this is my point.
1350396	1361138	We we have the experience behind us and we're still relatively young enough, I think, that we haven't quite lost touch with how the world works.
1362165	1365750	I mean, some of us have tried to stay in the loop, I'll put it that way.
1365750	1367793	There are people who are way out of the loop.
1367793	1373560	But my point remains, we had that perspective that no other generation has.
1374517	1376599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1397156	1405100	A lot of old gaming print ads I've seen from the 80s were text walls with art and no screenshots, but maybe showing off the game box for a bit of spice.
1405100	1405740	Yeah, absolutely.
1405740	1410603	And Bobby brings up like an example, a recent example where you can kind of see this now.
1410603	1416245	Bobby says that's the interesting thing about the Gold Master series stuff, which we've talked about before on this show.
1416245	1421608	You know, they have the Gold Master, Digital Eclipse, been doing the Gold Master Karateka, and they just released the Jeff Minder one.
1421608	1422769	I haven't played that yet.
1422769	1424810	I know Bobby talked about it on his show a little bit, but
1425450	1432394	In the Gold Master series, they show a lot of the ads of the games from back then, and it's very descriptive.
1432394	1440840	Part of what I've really enjoyed, at least about the Karateka, and I imagine the Jeff Minter one's very similar, is that it's really an interesting peek behind the curtain
1441360	1446203	of really how the games went from start to finish at that point.
1446203	1447364	It's very fascinating.
1447364	1447885	Look at that stuff.
1447885	1453769	And I really for those of you that are ever going to ask the question, how did we get here in gaming?
1453769	1457211	If you're ever going to ask yourself that question, I think this is a really fun trip to take.
1457211	1461914	And I think Digital Eclipse has done a really good job so far with this series, for sure.
1461914	1465597	So an Atari 50 is kind of Gold Master Zero, to be honest.
1465597	1467998	It's you know, that was it was the first sort of
1469554	1471536	Cut Proof of Concept of that whole thing.
1471536	1486213	So anyway, yeah, it's, you know, a lot of people kind of reminiscing about you have to wait a break man saying you used to have to wait until six or 11 to find out what was happening in the world, or the next day in the paper.
1486213	1487073	That is a very
1488442	1495467	Perceptive sort of look at this versus what happens today, where now it's like immediately on your phone and it's everywhere.
1495467	1508197	You know, I remember and I think, you know, not to get too weird, but since you brought up the Xeniel generation, I would say probably the news media event that unites us all would have been the Challenger explosion.
1508897	1512399	when the space shuttle, you know, and because why is that?
1512399	1514820	Because we were all in grade school when it happened.
1514820	1516761	Our generation was in grade school when it happened.
1516761	1521503	So everybody has a sense of where were you when that whole thing happened?
1521503	1526845	And some, depending on what coast you're at, the East Coasters, I think a lot of them saw it live.
1526845	1529927	And that was a very shocking thing.
1529927	1534689	Now for us on the West Coast, that was like a 6 a.m., 6.30 a.m., so not everybody saw it.
1534689	1536910	So I remember being told- I was in Alabama.
1537350	1538291	Yeah, did you see it live?
1538291	1539772	We were watching the launch live.
1539772	1541814	Wow, see.
1541814	1544496	I watched that shit live.
1544496	1544916	Yeah.
1544916	1546157	And it was funny.
1546157	1552582	You know how a couple of Fridays ago, I had a fuck it Friday with my ballet friends.
1552582	1557426	Some of them are younger, of course, and had only heard of it, not actually seen it.
1557426	1559147	So like, do you want to see what we saw?
1559147	1563190	Because my other friend had lived in Central Time as well.
1563911	1570162	So we put it up and watched and they both looked at us and said, how are you not fucked up growing up with that?
1570162	1572125	I'm like, little do you know.
1572125	1572346	Well.
1572967	1582554	Yeah, and then like, well, every generation also kind of had, I would say the generation after us has 9-11 as an example of, you know, that similar sort of thing.
1582554	1586236	But again, that was really playing out live for a lot of people, right?
1586236	1590319	So anyway, my point is, when that all happened, being on the West Coast, I had friends who were in the damn building.
1590319	1595443	I didn't find out about the Challenger until my second grade teacher showed up late.
1595443	1596904	And we were all wondering where the teacher was.
1596904	1599366	And she showed up late and she had to tell the class what happened and why she was late.
1599966	1600687	Thanks for watching!
1612472	1629677	Morning in class we had been there for a couple of hours and we were all excited we drew pictures of of shuttles and all of this stuff and we were all we put our desks in like a semicircle around the class TV that they bring out on that big black stand on the wheels yep
1630157	1636521	And then, and we were all like, and for me, like, when I was that age, I kind of wanted to be an astronaut.
1636521	1638703	I was like, this is a big deal for me.
1638703	1640444	I want this to happen.
1640444	1655454	And then just watching it explode into our, you know, young 10 year old minds, you know, we were, we had no concept of how dangerous a mission like that could be until we saw it ourselves.
1656650	1656750	and
1677372	1680956	hit the tower around again, six kind of early I wasn't up for work.
1680956	1681977	I was awake.
1681977	1688183	And I just I distinctly remember he Bobby says this is evergreen content kind of the whole where were you moment?
1688183	1692568	I distinctly remember because I'm, I'm going to choose my words very carefully.
1692568	1694970	But I lived with someone at the time.
1696311	1700614	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1716986	1720229	I think Richard and I went on our first date the night before.
1720229	1721450	I think it was that.
1721450	1737242	So I remember getting up that morning and I'm getting ready to go to work and I walk out and my crazy ex-roommate was like, well, a plane just hit the World Trade Center and there's a bunch of planes still up in the sky and we don't know where they're headed and they're going to probably crash and other things.
1737242	1738083	Have a great day at work.
1738083	1738323	Bye.
1739810	1740470	Jeez.
1740470	1742511	And I was like, you are so like him though.
1742511	1749474	And yeah, and I was like, like in my in my head, I'm like, dry manner, such a bitch, like in my head.
1749474	1753055	And I just I just got in the car, which and it didn't like nothing hit me.
1753055	1757557	All I could think about is like, what a fucking bitch this guy was basically.
1757557	1759998	And I hated this situation I was in.
1759998	1763940	And I ended up driving to work.
1763940	1767001	And at the time, I was listening to Howard Stern.
1768237	1768597	because
1784622	1787123	not normal that day, right?
1787123	1796064	It was very like, you know, and it was when I was hearing this, I was like, Oh my God, like the reality of the situation hit me.
1796064	1801786	And I remember getting to work and I just like sat in the parking lot and I didn't even want to go in the building, but I did eventually.
1801786	1807787	And everybody was just huddled around somebody's little black and white TV that they would watch soap operas on while they did their work.
1807787	1813448	So for me, I went to get up to check, um, to check the weather.
1815077	1818838	And it was on the Weather Channel.
1818838	1826359	And now I think I like had like my little Nokia or my, you remember my Sony Ericsson phone?
1826359	1831640	So I'm like, I pull out my phone the first thing and I call Grandmom.
1831640	1833541	I'm like, Grandmom, turn on the TV.
1833541	1834401	Well, what channel?
1834401	1837501	I was like, it doesn't matter, pick one.
1837501	1838942	It's a news channel.
1838942	1839862	And then she looks at it and says,
1841257	1843618	Well, Jamie, what am I looking at?
1843618	1849459	And I told her, and we were on the phone together right when the second one hit.
1849459	1851560	And I went to work.
1851560	1854101	This is when I was working for the money store.
1854101	1857181	Well, after it was the money store, but you know, subprime lending.
1857181	1860002	We hardly got a call all day.
1860002	1866524	And I actually got a call from a coworker because this is at the time that First Union had merged.
1867996	1883238	And they're like, like, I'm just like, I'm calling because I need to see if like, if someone like if my daughter had called here, because we had people who are calling us to check on their family.
1884113	1894499	who were employees for, uh, you know, like we, we can't route that information, but I talked to one person who had gotten out of the building after the second one hit.
1894499	1901462	I had a friend who had gone to her lunch break before the first one and did not go back clearly.
1901462	1911988	And another one who was actually under rubble and was saved because of, uh, the way like something fell on her propped up, uh,
1912981	1919483	enough of the rubble to keep her from getting crushed and like her phone ringer was alerting people to where she was.
1934321	1939708	We're talking about the way how we have consumed news now has completely changed.
1939708	1944915	Because think about how something like that now plays out on Twitter.
1944915	1947979	It's such a different sort of thing.
1947979	1950842	And, you know, for big gaming alerts and things like that,
1952410	1955732	I don't know, it's just, it's very interesting how a lot of that has changed.
1955732	1968037	You know, but I'm also reading chat, and sjo100mat makes a very interesting point that's a little bit humbling, saying that for topical purposes, I found out about Bin Laden was found and killed while listening to OLR.
1968037	1976020	And you might remember, that's the interesting thing about doing the show live, is that that happened while we were in the middle of the show.
1976560	1986837	And I remember having to say, because we were at your house at the time, I think, doing this live, DarkSakura, and I remember at the time having to say like, um, I know this is weird, but there's like a big thing going on.
1986837	1988539	We're just going to like talk about it for a second.
1988539	1990262	And, you know, kind of got into that.
1990262	1990703	So it's very,
1991664	1992844	Very interesting.
1992844	2004989	That's very humbling, thinking about that that was a very big news story of a different time, and how maybe we are entwined with that for some people is very, very humbling.
2004989	2017374	I guarantee you today, if something like that happened, if we had another big, you know, terrorist, well, actually, look at the terrorist attack on Israel, how that played out.
2018348	2025569	How there were live tweets, tweets coming from people who were, oh my God, they're outside of my house.
2025569	2029010	Or, you know, text messages, things like that.
2029010	2031250	That is how our news is being reported.
2031250	2034411	That's how big attacks like this is being reported.
2034411	2040312	Well, and it's also a lot of it is, here it is, and here's how you should feel about it.
2040312	2041272	Exactly.
2041272	2046113	But there's a lot of recycling of, I'm just going to say it like this, other people's content.
2046113	2046393	Oh, sure.
2047375	2058659	It's like having a free interview with an eyewitness, but they're taking it and just their articles are predominantly taken up by other people's tweets and then speculation on it.
2058659	2063821	And I don't think that that's that that's like the eyewitness news kind of thing.
2063821	2065842	But that's how they're doing a lot of stories today.
2065842	2073665	This is Pop Crave's entire thing is just finding the hit tweet and putting their own spin on it and retweeting it.
2075327	2078554	And then all the people that follow that site.
2078554	2079395	It's fascinating.
2079395	2081179	Anyway.
2081179	2086570	That goes back to people not doing their own research again and putting out speculation that people are taking as fact.
2087455	2091838	All right, it is a video game show, believe it or not, but it's also a video game community.
2091838	2098762	So let's talk a little bit about and again, I'm sorry to leave this lead story as, wow, this sucks.
2098762	2101243	I, I don't know what else we can do about this.
2101243	2109448	Again, this this doesn't change unless there is a fundamental way and how we consume in a fundamental change in the way we consume information.
2109448	2110309	That's not happening tomorrow.
2112378	2116220	No, just wait until we have the chips that download how we think into our head.
2116220	2119681	Well, hold on because we have a story coming up on that later.
2119681	2125263	But for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2125263	2127044	So DarkSakura, what games have you been playing this week?
2128545	2134128	I have been playing a good bit of Avatar again.
2134128	2138451	I'm sort of putting off ending the game.
2138451	2142293	Although I found that you can keep playing when the game is done, so I might do that.
2142293	2145835	You know, just like, I'm going to be a Navi for the rest of ever.
2145835	2149117	I've been playing Dead by Daylight.
2149117	2154220	I'm going to be playing, of course, more today because I want to get through the Blood Moon thing.
2154220	2156742	And I haven't touched Killer at all during it.
2160344	2167390	I've been playing the Saturn Castlevania Symphony of the Night, or Nocturne in the Moonlight.
2167390	2174815	Right now I'm in that exploring and locating shit phase, although I think I got four familiars and other forms.
2174815	2178078	I got the mist form, the bat form, and the wolf form.
2178078	2182841	And then I got the other power-ups for those.
2182841	2187285	But I still need to get the Spikebreaker armor so I can go get the walk armor.
2188424	2196521	The walk armor, if no one knows, is the best armor to have in that game when you have done over 100% map completion.
2196521	2199587	Because the more of the map that you fill up, the stronger your armor gets.
2200740	2212667	Um, so I'm trying to get back down to the, the, um, the catacombs so I can fight some werewolves and get a Yatatsuna, which to me is the best weapon in the game short of the, uh, the jeweled fist.
2212667	2226154	Um, and yes, the Saturn version is better, but what's awesome about the one that I'm playing is that it has the English dialogue, um, from the PSP version or the PlayStation one that came out.
2226154	2229516	I remember that being a story on the show several weeks ago that that patch was, yeah.
2230456	2235782	And I had it downloaded then, I just hadn't started it, I think, or maybe I had just started it.
2235782	2246134	But it's still got a lot of the Japanese voices left in there, which is funny, because you get dialogue in one language, and then
2246714	2260623	You get, you know, you hear it in, you know, the background stuff in Japanese, but they also bumped it up to where it takes full advantage of the Saturn's capability, where the one that we got originally was very rushed.
2260623	2264946	It was, it, I paid 20 bucks for it when it came out, you know, and now it's going for mega bucks.
2266030	2279144	But it just wasn't super polished and it didn't use a lot of the better transparency effects and the better 2D animation that the Saturn was capable of.
2279144	2281267	So this is very well done.
2281267	2284911	This is what the game should have been.
2284911	2285251	And then...
2287546	2291649	I played something else, but I don't remember.
2291649	2297254	So, oh, yeah, we took out Weird Al because Dan hosted League.
2297254	2300456	And so we put in Final Resistance on the P3.
2300456	2303879	So we played some of that.
2303879	2305660	All right, we'll go over to Loki.
2305660	2307221	How was your gaming week?
2307221	2310404	I didn't play much other than, you know, Minecraft.
2310404	2314527	So I've been working on a big Redstone project.
2315970	2317230	That's now done.
2317230	2319751	I'm actually editing the video for it.
2319751	2327372	So it's a big super smelter and it's awesome because it's very fast and ridiculously large.
2327372	2328793	So that'll be coming very soon.
2328793	2331933	Hopefully, maybe even tomorrow.
2331933	2338595	And then I'm taking some time off this week to work on the first theme park ride because it's taking a lot of time to
2340555	2359142	build all that and conceptualize it and get everything working so I'm getting closer there each day but yeah mostly this week it's been movies so I saw the new Ghostbusters movie yesterday and then on Thursday I saw Rad which is an old BMX
2360883	2361783	DMX movie from 1986.
2361783	2365045	Oh, hell, I love that fucking movie.
2365045	2365305	Yep.
2365305	2367566	They had it in theaters for a rad day.
2367566	2369186	It was awesome.
2369186	2371727	My kids did not want to stay for the Q&A afterwards.
2371727	2379850	And so I was a little bit bummed there because they had, I guess, Ed Helms from like The Office, the comedian.
2379850	2386133	He was hosting the Q&A with I don't know who it was supposed to be because it was all through that like Fathom Events thing.
2386133	2388313	But apparently he writes BMX.
2388313	2389014	Who knew?
2389014	2389234	Like,
2390374	2394256	That's a thing he does though, and I guess he's a fan of the movie, so it would have been interesting.
2394256	2397498	But yeah, I've been trying to get him to see that movie forever now.
2397498	2405381	And so now we have to watch all of the different extreme sports, like, movies.
2405381	2409003	So, like, there's... Show him Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.
2409003	2411464	There's BMX in that.
2411464	2412265	Yeah, there is.
2412265	2413405	That's true.
2413405	2419188	Like, Thrasher was just one... I think it's Thrasher or Thrash, which I was just...
2420410	2438840	reminded of, I've never seen it, but like I, it was in another video I was watching, but like, um, you know, Gleaming the Cube and, and, uh, you know, a little bit later Airborne, which is, you know, the like Rollerblade type movie, um, to go along with all this type of stuff.
2438840	2441041	Do you remember Solar Babies?
2441041	2441261	No.
2442716	2449599	They were like stuck in this area, but they played like some weird version of lacrosse.
2449599	2452080	God, there was another one too that I was thinking of.
2452080	2453081	Yeah, I know what you mean.
2453081	2455241	Prayer of the Rollerboys was another one.
2455241	2456682	Ah, yes, yes.
2456682	2458023	Prayer of the Rollerboys.
2458023	2460103	That's a good one.
2460103	2463605	And I mean, even I guess, oh God, what was the other one?
2463605	2465826	Robot Jocks.
2467439	2467959	Thanks for watching!
2483297	2484037	It was fine.
2484037	2484617	I don't know.
2484617	2490879	It was like, certainly it's not going to be as good as the last one because the last one was essentially remaking the first movie.
2490879	2495500	And then there's just like, how much nostalgia can we inject into your veins?
2495500	2503763	So this one's a little bit more normal, but there's like, I don't know, like the old Ghostbusters cast.
2504833	2519401	like some of like okay Bill Murray phoning it in I mean he's in it for like a couple minutes really didn't even need to be in the movie like there's no point for it um it was okay and then there's there's also like
2521075	2523136	I mean, I'm just rolling my eyes because it's ridiculous.
2523136	2524517	Like, who cares?
2524517	2535665	Um, there's a scene with, um, this ghost girl and the young, uh, Spengler and there, there's like some chemistry there.
2535665	2539867	You don't know if it's friendship of, oh no, maybe it's lesbian chemistry.
2539867	2540628	Who gives a shit?
2540628	2541809	Like, it's just a movie.
2541809	2544611	Like, but people are making a big deal about dumb shit like that.
2544611	2546212	Like who cares?
2546212	2546312	Um,
2546932	2547773	I was okay.
2547773	2548993	I wasn't interested in the movie.
2548993	2557719	I mean, there was a reason that they they took out the the ghost sex scene with Dan Aykroyd.
2557719	2558419	I'm sorry.
2558419	2562882	I wasn't interested in this movie until you told me I'm missing out on lesbian ghosts.
2562882	2564403	Like, hell yeah.
2564403	2566684	That should be the tagline.
2566684	2568445	Why are they calling it Frozen Empire?
2568445	2571127	They should have called it Ghostbusters Lesbian Ghosts.
2571127	2572008	I wouldn't be into that.
2572788	2601675	So here's the thing like even with all that like it's the best description I've heard of it is it they said it feels like someone took an episode of the real Ghostbusters and gave them the budget to make a full movie based off of one episode of that show and that's kind of yeah it kind of feels like that a little bit it's like kind of the ghost of the week you know they explain it it's not really tied into the old movies or anything it's just it's just a ghost that's trying to
2602844	2607846	Tiara was telling me this morning that they thought it started off really strong and kind of fizzled at the end.
2631784	2633225	Yeah, that's what a lot of people have been saying.
2633225	2633985	I guess.
2633985	2636786	It didn't really feel like the pacing was slow to me.
2636786	2639948	There's a lot of like... I don't know.
2639948	2644810	There's a lot of people that are like characters from the first movie that just like...
2645680	2647742	Oh, hey, look, I'm in New York now, too.
2647742	2649764	Oh, hey, look, I'm in New York now, too.
2649764	2652166	Like it's like, where are all these people coming from?
2652166	2653507	Why are they here for no reason?
2653507	2655189	We are all in New York right now.
2655189	2655769	Exactly.
2655769	2661995	It's like, oh, hey, you're you podcast, you know, the character from the last movie from Oklahoma City.
2661995	2666839	Oh, now you're helping Ray film his like podcast like.
2666839	2667220	Why?
2668254	2671196	What do you think about the trailer for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice?
2671196	2671776	I want to see it.
2671776	2672676	I'm excited about Beetlejuice.
2695161	2698059	I love that Lydia is still hyper goth.
2700953	2702714	I'm just so happy Catherine O'Hara is still in it.
2702714	2707756	And they got, yes, I was about to say they got the lady, the legend.
2707756	2715360	Yeah, well, and it's very obvious who dies at the beginning because only one of the original cast of Beetlejuice is in jail for very, very, very bad crimes.
2715360	2722063	So, so anyway, or maybe on parole, but on a registry at this point.
2722063	2724384	So they will not be making any more movies, rightfully so.
2724384	2724624	All right.
2724624	2727366	Anyway, although the first movie still has one of my favorite lines.
2728496	2733229	If you don't let me gut out this house and make it my own, I will go insane and I will take you with me.
2733229	2734492	All right.
2734492	2735214	Back to games.
2735214	2736116	Loki, any other games?
2738047	2739869	Um, no, that was it.
2739869	2740649	All right.
2740649	2741349	My Game of Week.
2741349	2747033	So I have, of course, the good old favorites like Final Fantasy 14, still working on that.
2747033	2747953	Still playing.
2747953	2752236	I even I even signed into Dead by Daylight this week, which I haven't played in months.
2752236	2754497	I played a match.
2754497	2756658	I passed away because I didn't have very good team.
2756658	2758219	No, I escaped one of them.
2758219	2763242	I played a couple matches because I escaped one of them because I got called selfish because I left somebody on the hook.
2763242	2763783	But I'm like,
2764403	2765785	DarkSakura
2782023	2784564	You need to play The Unknown.
2802834	2804375	Yeah, I guess I'll check it out at some point.
2804375	2809539	I did not... The Unknown is the first super fun killer we've had in the game.
2809539	2810640	Oh, really?
2810640	2813182	I haven't... I didn't go against them in any of the matches I played.
2813182	2816525	I think I had like a... I don't even remember what it was.
2816525	2828934	But yeah, just... It takes the good parts of... Well, I mean, I love Sadako as well, but it takes kind of the good parts of Sadako and Dredge.
2828934	2829395	And then
2830465	2836727	the good parts that should have been with the Singularity and marries them in utter creep fest.
2836727	2840749	Both games I played were against the Singularity for some reason.
2840749	2841369	I don't know.
2841369	2842949	Singularity has been having an uptick.
2842949	2843409	Yeah.
2843409	2845230	Anyway, um, but other stuff.
2845230	2847311	So how about some non normal stuff?
2847311	2850892	Because there's a couple games I played that were a little outside the norm for me.
2851312	2851733	PlunderStorm
2871593	2877998	to go over to Plunderstorm and you have your basically like seasoned character or whatever, because this is only supposed to be a six week event.
2877998	2881720	And it essentially is World of Warcraft meets Fortnite.
2881720	2893148	It is very intentionally them building a Fortnite type of thing into World of Warcraft, except instead of guns and shooting, it is using randomly acquired spells, which is a very interesting sort of thing.
2893148	2899413	So it puts a roguelike twist onto it, which I guess if you think about it, a lot of stuff in Fortnite is random as well.
2899413	2900533	But yeah, so you
2901394	2917826	you would you uh kill uh mobs and npcs and sometimes they drop spells and you have to choose what spells to take out and then you also can grab plunder gold and occasionally you run into other players and you have to engage in combat and hopefully your spell kit is good enough and you're leveled
2918346	2923350	It was kind of difficult in the beginning because it doesn't teach you a lot of what's going on.
2923350	2926572	Yeah, I did stream it and most of my games were horrible.
2926572	2934658	I was legit last place one of my games, 60th place, because I landed the exact same place someone else did and they took me out right away as much as I tried to fight it.
2934658	2937841	But yeah, as 200 Matt does point out, I got top five one game.
2937841	2943645	I was like fourth place one game, mostly because I ran around like a little bitch and just was like on the outskirts.
2943645	2947208	I was trying to like find more NPCs to kill, but it kept me alive for a very long time.
2947888	2949389	But one game I was on a roll.
2949389	2951750	I killed three other people before I died.
2951750	2956313	Just when I was starting to think, like, am I ever going to be able to kill somebody in this game, I got like three people in one match.
2956313	2957494	I was like, okay.
2957494	2957914	Otherwise...
2959204	2960585	It was fine.
2960585	2967771	I anticipated I would do a three hour stream of Plunderstorm because I usually try to do a stream around three hours.
2967771	2969593	I was done with it after an hour and a half.
2969593	2971414	I was like, all right, bored now.
2971414	2973756	Like, let's let's move on.
2973756	2977079	So I'm not sure what kind of lasting power that has.
2977079	2979621	So it's probably best as a sideshow.
2979621	2984185	But I think it's cute that they're using the Warcraft engine to kind of do some of these things.
2985026	2990952	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says maybe you need a guide of 10 things you should know before starting World of Warcraft's Fortnite mode.
2990952	2994295	I'll tell you what, go look up Plunderstorm on Kotaku.
2994295	2998278	I guarantee that that guide exists, exactly what you just said.
2998278	3001882	Because I think I saw it on there as I was browsing the main page when all this other stuff came up.
3002242	3004943	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3024039	3025600	That was a little diversion.
3025600	3033044	The other game I played that for me was brand new, and maybe you will be surprised to hear that I played this game, is I played Foam Stars.
3034147	3040129	This game has been in the news a lot because there is a minimal amount of AI that they have used in the game.
3040129	3042230	And so it's gotten a lot of shit for that.
3042230	3052915	And I will say the AI is limited to very, very, very, all it is, it's when you're in the sound player, it's the album arts are very AI generated.
3052915	3053495	Here's the thing.
3054275	3056719	They look out of place.
3056719	3059184	I don't know what the fuck they were thinking with that whole thing.
3059184	3063150	That was a really bad decision to do that.
3063150	3065975	Here's the thing about Foamstars, and why did I play this game?
3065975	3067978	Because Shane and I made an agreement.
3068902	3071344	because he's been really into Foam Stars and enjoying it.
3071344	3077989	He said, if you play Foam Stars on stream, I'll play a game that you want on stream later.
3077989	3086136	And he assumed I would pick Diablo, but I was like, no, Diablo is kind of like, I don't think it's a good right now to like level with somebody.
3086136	3089899	So coming soon, because I think we're going to do it after the current event.
3089899	3091841	I'm going to make Shane play Dead by Daylight with me.
3091841	3092742	He's never played before.
3094804	3095525	So that'll be fun.
3095525	3096125	So stay tuned for that.
3096125	3097947	So the agreement was I'll play Foam Stars.
3097947	3099287	He plays Dead by Daylight.
3099287	3101789	So I play Foam Stars.
3101789	3102530	Here's the thing.
3102530	3104311	The game actually isn't bad.
3104311	3106432	Like a lot of people compare it to Splatoon.
3106432	3108173	And yeah, I get the Splatoon comparisons.
3108173	3115818	But believe it or not, the whole like foam mechanic where you're actually riding on the foam and you don't really like go underneath it.
3115818	3120341	You're more like on this board where you can kind of like make walls and all this stuff.
3120341	3123644	Like it does kind of end up being a very different sort of mechanic.
3123644	3123804	And
3124444	3153422	um uh you can uh the heroes that you play are more like overwatch in splatoon everything is very well you can do this weapon or that weapon have this ultimate or that ultimate and uh the way foam stars is put together is a little more of an overwatch sort of feeling but that stuff aside when when we would actually get into a match we didn't get into everything we queued up for because nobody's fucking playing this game anymore no but like people were playing this game for it's people aren't playing this fucking game
3154412	3165019	And it's unfortunate because the game isn't bad, but this game is one of the most grossly mismanaged games I think I've seen in a very long time.
3165019	3171143	And just yet another shining example of how the people at the top of the industry don't know what the fuck they're doing.
3171143	3173885	And this AI thing is an excellent example of that.
3173885	3178008	Sj100mat says, creating real album art is two weeks worth of work.
3178008	3179969	The AI got it done in two hours.
3179969	3181270	That was a bad fucking call.
3181630	3187212	somebody should have gone outside and take photographs and used crappy Photoshop filters and put cheap text on them.
3187212	3192193	I could have got them done in two hours and have them look just as just as compelling.
3192193	3194114	Like that was a bad call.
3194114	3195835	Or here's another idea.
3195835	3200996	Don't have you who says you need to have fucking album art on your sound test mode.
3200996	3202137	Just don't have it.
3202137	3204097	Because it has nothing to do with the rest of the game.
3204097	3207198	And then you don't get all this negative present is a bad idea.
3207198	3209159	But even putting that aside,
3210353	3219938	Consider the fact that Foam Stars, a Square Enix product, launched the same day on PlayStation Plus as Helldivers 2.
3219938	3223841	So PlayStation, you know, obviously put a lot into that, and that game's big.
3223841	3231245	But then also, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth demo launched the same day as Foam Stars, also a Square Enix product.
3232492	3236355	So this game was really set up to fail on multiple perspectives.
3236355	3239798	And now it's like, nothing is supporting this game.
3239798	3244361	This game is gonna go ass up soon, because it's no longer free on PlayStation Plus.
3244361	3254448	And I'm sorry, don't pay $30 for this game, when there's all these like battle pass, microtransaction, all the shit you'd expect to see.
3254448	3255229	Don't do it.
3255229	3256210	People aren't gonna do it.
3257889	3264132	This game has been set up to fail by gross mismanagement and there's no other way around it because otherwise the game wasn't bad.
3264132	3274297	I had a lot of fun playing with Shane and playing on stream and I'm kind of surprised that I'm saying that because I remember when I played the demo, I didn't really care for it.
3274297	3283022	But playing the game with Shane gave me a perspective on the game that not even any fucking guide in the world could do.
3284597	3291221	And that is somebody could just explain to me what to do and what I was seeing meant and what the strategy was in the current moment.
3291221	3293362	Somebody was able to like kind of walk me through that.
3293362	3298825	And that made the game like 100 times more fun, playing with somebody who kind of knows what they're talking about.
3298825	3306089	So anyway, the break man says so this is another case of publisher interference is the biggest problem, sort of.
3307179	3308400	SSU 100 Matt.
3308400	3314123	Oh, yeah, is responding to a comment that Bobby Blackwolf made saying what is the TTP or time to penis and foam stars?
3314123	3316485	When Rob starts playing is the answer.
3316485	3319487	Just an interesting aside on this whole thing.
3319487	3322748	And this is not something I usually care about.
3322748	3324449	I want to stress.
3324449	3328852	But this was one of those things where I went, that's really fucking interesting.
3328852	3330453	And I don't get it.
3330453	3333495	I had more viewers than I've ever had for a stream playing foam stars.
3336027	3337048	Interesting.
3337048	3344794	I had I had almost I had an average of high 30s playing average.
3344794	3347696	I don't and again, I don't usually care about that shit.
3347696	3348396	It's just one of those things.
3348396	3350238	I was like, what?
3350238	3351319	Why?
3351319	3352159	Huh?
3352159	3355201	And I guess I was like the only person playing it on Twitch.
3355201	3356643	And maybe that's part of the reason about it.
3356643	3361006	Yeah, Mike Dev says you dominated in the foam stars category because literally nobody else was playing it.
3362608	3364430	So it was just interesting.
3364430	3371316	And yeah, SGO100Matt says I got raided a couple times, which yeah, probably helped, but it's just, I, but I retained, I retained the raids.
3371316	3373077	That doesn't usually happen.
3373077	3377241	So it's, yeah, it was just a very, huh?
3377241	3378662	Sort of thing.
3378662	3380684	Anyway.
3380684	3381725	All right.
3381725	3382626	That's it for my gaming week.
3383615	3390637	Let's move on and talk about some gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.
3390637	3391557	Loki, we'll start.
3391557	3399779	Oh, but I will just mention really quick, because usually here's when we talk about housekeeping and what's going on in show news.
3399779	3402519	FYI, tonight is episode 997.
3402519	3412182	That means episode 1,000, which really was a thing that we could only really dream and joke about literally at one point when this show hits 1,000 episodes.
3413622	3415483	I distinctly remember that in an old episode.
3415483	3420705	We joked, Oh, yeah, we'll never get to 1000 episodes, but it would happen in the year like 2023 or 2024, whatever.
3420705	3425327	So April 14 is going to end up being our 1000th episode of Orange Launch Radio.
3425327	3429649	We are the only weekly gaming podcast to get to 1000 episodes.
3429649	3433230	And that's pretty wild to think about.
3433230	3441734	So and I just want to say, you know, I don't expect that this is going to get a lot of traction because, you know, we have, of course, our podcast listeners that we love.
3442054	3445336	We have maybe mid 20s viewing us on Twitch right now.
3445336	3447497	So we're not like, you know, top tier.
3447497	3448157	And it's fine.
3448157	3448577	It's okay.
3448577	3449598	We've made peace of that work.
3449598	3455941	We, we have awesome people with us every week that keep us going.
3455941	3465486	But it's just one of those things where it's like, it's really just kind of neat to kind of go like, holy shit, we did this thing that literally was only a dream.
3465486	3467527	And we're going to hit that landmark on April 14th.
3467527	3468468	This is
3469557	3470798	It's wild and it's awesome.
3470798	3473922	So thank you all who have been here for the ride.
3473922	3475864	It's, it's very deeply appreciated.
3475864	3479849	And yeah, Bobby Blackwell says, I mean, we're in the top 1% of Twitch with our mid 20 viewers.
3479849	3485295	Yeah, no, look, and I don't want to, I'm very thankful for every viewer that we have.
3485295	3486196	Absolutely.
3486196	3487417	My point is, is that
3488058	3495402	We're it's not like people that the mass the guide writing gaming media or the mainstream is going to give a shit.
3495402	3509368	We're not a let's say Asmongold or something where that guy fucking farts and they write a news article about it on various websites that AI helps them generates, like or you know, a lot of other people Pokimane makes a decision about you know what she's doing.
3509368	3511369	And, you know, again, every website starts to roll.
3511369	3512470	We're not that and that's okay.
3512470	3513110	Again, the
3513430	3518372	There's actually a lot of good things that come with not having a constant eye on you all the time.
3518372	3524873	Um, so it's just but I just, I don't expect that there's going to be a lot of fanfare and that's okay.
3524873	3525834	All right.
3525834	3528735	Yeah, SJ100Math says thank you for taking us along on your dream journey.
3528735	3530975	Well, there wouldn't be a journey if you all weren't here.
3530975	3532936	So very much appreciate that.
3533902	3536525	Alright, now we can actually get into some gaming news.
3536525	3537926	Sorry Loki, go ahead.
3537926	3539208	That's alright.
3539208	3542391	So Steam Family Sharing is getting very interesting.
3542391	3550500	So now they're going to be replacing Steam Families, essentially Steam Families is going to replace
3551141	3552782	Support up to 6 family members total
3568254	3576036	with both offline availability and they said streamlined license availability is at long last.
3576036	3594262	What I think is really cool about it, though, is that basically like I could be playing a game on Steam and if my kids want to play one of the like other 900 probably games that I have, they can do that without any sort of interruption to what I'm doing.
3594262	3595302	Also, they said that
3596576	3603221	Apparently the game license owner can continue playing other games while one license is being shared with the family members.
3603221	3608766	Users accessing shared games can now play them offline as well.
3608766	3617733	And I think there was something, they're saying, yeah, retain all key features, including separate achievements, save games, and other player generated content.
3617733	3623017	So yes, my kids are very excited about this because I have a lot of games that they would like to play.
3626161	3629783	And some may actually end up having to use this.
3629783	3634105	Are they able to prevent people from sharing this across the distance?
3634105	3636147	I don't think so.
3636147	3638688	It just says you designate six family members.
3638688	3642050	So I consider my friends family.
3642050	3643571	So it's some of us.
3643571	3644571	Yeah.
3644571	3646973	So, you know, we can do that.
3646973	3647333	But yeah.
3649373	3652115	E3VL says technically anyone can be family.
3652115	3652675	Interesting.
3652675	3654517	It's kind of a risky maneuver.
3654517	3658479	But it sounds like you can only add people or I'm sorry, remove.
3658479	3661541	If you've removed them, you can't replace them for like a year or something like that.
3661541	3664803	Like they've put a very long like you can't just rotate your family in.
3664803	3667525	You'd have to think really hard about who you're gonna have, right?
3668584	3670385	Yeah.
3670385	3676389	Bobby Blackwell says my wife likes this idea because she wants access to my Jackbox games on her laptop and I own them all on Steam.
3676389	3678951	Yeah, I mean, Alan and I can consolidate our libraries too.
3678951	3682193	I don't know if he has anything that I like really want.
3682193	3694081	But here's like here's here once again, like this is I like this type of thinking out of the box and stuff because like we have we know that there's another switch coming down the line here pretty soon.
3694081	3697424	And we know that, you know, mom or dad or whomever is
3698550	3701773	Accumulating a large library of games that they don't play.
3701773	3706176	Wouldn't it be nice to like just be able to gift your kids a Steam deck or something like that?
3706176	3714423	And boom, now they have instant access to 800, 900 games, you know, like without any additional fees or charges.
3714423	3717125	And I mean, that's a very good point.
3717125	3718626	Steam's been around a while now.
3718626	3724370	Those folks that started Steam accounts in college and built up a library are probably parents of
3725211	3727192	game playing age kids now.
3727192	3730815	Yeah, I have so many games and so many unredeemed games.
3730815	3735197	Like it's ridiculous the amount of like I was trying to consult.
3735197	3741861	There's no way like I've gone through like humble but I wish there was a way to like mark off redeemed, not redeemed or whatever.
3741861	3750467	But like I had to compile like large files of just keys of games and like see cross reference what I have and stuff.
3750467	3750587	It's
3751690	3752871	It's insane.
3752871	3756072	Breakman in chat says, I was laughing at this comment.
3756072	3761494	Breakman says, LOL, dear children, my pile of shame is now your Merry Christmas.
3761494	3763795	Kind of.
3763795	3764836	That's really funny.
3764836	3766097	I like that.
3766097	3766657	I don't know.
3766657	3775721	I would want like something that doesn't necessarily merge the libraries, you know, but gives you access to it.
3776940	3779981	Which, that's what the old method did, right?
3779981	3781281	I don't remember, it's been a while.
3781281	3782541	Yeah, I don't think this is merging.
3782541	3783521	I think that that's better.
3783521	3784422	Yeah.
3784422	3789163	I mean, it sounds to me like it's merging them, and I don't think that's a good idea.
3789163	3796484	I think if it's similar to the old method, you still see ultimately whose game it is on the Steam page before you launch it.
3796484	3799505	Alan and I used to have a shared library, but it stopped at some point.
3799505	3801805	Like, I don't know what we did, so yeah.
3801805	3803926	Nobody gets any of my stuff, I'm keeping it to myself.
3804426	3811751	Basically, the difference now is before it used to be if someone was playing something from your library, you couldn't play anything from it.
3811751	3817615	So now they're saying, well, as long as it's not the same game you're playing, then it's fine.
3817615	3819257	Which, cool.
3819257	3820498	Yeah.
3820498	3820898	Interesting.
3821960	3830242	All right, well, let's move on and talk about some talks that happened at GDC because Game Developers Conference was this weekend.
3830242	3839864	And although there's not a ton, a ton of gaming news that usually comes out of Game Developers Conference, there's sometimes some interesting little tidbits as the industry looks at literally like how the sausage is made.
3839864	3845245	There's a lot of game developers that come together and talk about, you know, what they've done for games, what's worked, what hasn't worked.
3845245	3849587	And sometimes we do get news about, you know, new features for game creators.
3849587	3851227	We'll get into a story about that later.
3851727	3857492	But for this, let's talk about a talk on Super Mario Brothers Wonder.
3857492	3871242	So there was some slides that came out that were shared on Twitter talking about Nintendo's Super Mario Wonder team showing off different brainstorming sessions that it had in a talk that they were having.
3871242	3875826	The game's directors, Shiro Mori and producer Takashi Tezuka,
3876486	3879587	were sharing some insight about what went into the process.
3879587	3885890	So some of the brainstorming sessions had Mario surfing, riding a unicycle, jumping on a pogo stick.
3885890	3887911	I'm kind of surprised that wasn't something they went with.
3887911	3890132	That sounds kind of fun.
3890132	3895954	They also even went as far as to have Wonder Effect testing sessions and unused Wonder Effects.
3895954	3903698	There was even a prototype level that was completely cut with a giant block Mario where enemies were chomping away at his head.
3904704	3909446	Player turns into a giant block Mario and advances while avoiding getting eaten.
3909446	3911207	Anyway, it sounds pretty cool.
3911207	3915709	Could make for a very interesting Mario Maker later on if they ever went that way, but who knows?
3915709	3927014	Anyway, also in the talk or previously to the talk, some of the folks behind Super Mario Brothers Wonder have mentioned how they prototyped all sorts of things.
3927014	3931116	They had over 2000 ideas that went into this game and just some of the
3931596	3945975	best ones were actually of course the ones that made it into the game uh there was a yoshi egg throwing mechanic that you saw in prior games uh also apparently miyamoto was not a big fan of the early elephant designs and so that was refined a little bit so
3946816	3947917	Um, interesting.
3947917	3960404	I mean, those are sorts of the, like what was left on the cutting room floor, sorts of things that you hear on GDC talks and fascinating stuff, but not usually the type of stuff that makes news headlines.
3960404	3963365	But I hope everybody that went to GDC had a really good time.
3963365	3966547	I thought there was a lot of very interesting things going on at GDC.
3966547	3971810	Apparently at some point there was a gathering of folks from the industry to let out a cathartic scream.
3972330	3978515	in front of GDC just just to reflect on the state of the gaming industry, layoffs, etc.
3978515	3981277	And everybody just fucking screamed for a minute.
3981277	3983139	And I'm sure I'm sure the police were called.
3983139	3990645	But it's those types of interesting events, you know, that probably made for a unique GDC this year.
3990645	3991706	All right.
3991706	3993287	Now, moving on DarkSakura.
3995576	3995937	Whale.
4017841	4023304	So that they can find ways of communicating with people through digital means.
4023304	4035152	And the first patient that had the chip installed, named Noland Arbaugh, has been able to do some cool things like playing video games.
4036993	4047498	So, one of the first things, and by the way, I should also say that he's only had a few issues with it, but no cognitive impairments.
4047498	4060263	But going back to this, he did a livestream with Neuralink, talking about playing chess, and also playing, Rob, you'll like this, Civ VI.
4060888	4061988	Yeah, I heard about this.
4061988	4062769	Yeah.
4062769	4065850	I mean, I'm playing just for eight hours.
4065850	4067470	Sorry, just full disclosure.
4067470	4078755	When I see Neuralink, I immediately roll my eyes because I know that it's a Elon Musk back thing and I just don't fucking like him and I don't intend to support anything that has his name attached to it.
4078755	4079235	However,
4080365	4093371	I am a little, I will admit it's a little torn because I do like hearing about, Oh, there's these things that allow, you know, more accessibility to certain people and allow, you know, people to, you know, uh, experience things they have not been able to so far.
4093371	4094692	So I'm a little torn.
4094692	4103777	My hope is that, you know, similar to, uh, the Tesla experience, uh, one company will do it and then other companies will do it, come in and do it even better.
4103777	4104317	That's my hope.
4105482	4108408	Ed intended not to bring up the ownership at all.
4117328	4119009	I'll save that for another thing.
4119009	4129094	Um, but anyway, though, the fact that something like this is in existence and someone made it and someone is living a better life because of it, I think that's awesome.
4129094	4134277	And the fact that they're using it to play video games is honestly even more awesome.
4134277	4144203	Um, the way that the chip works, it has like these different, uh, thread, thread-ish, like electrodes that go into parts of the brain that control movement.
4144203	4144843	And, um,
4146776	4157381	And so it helps with responding on a computer, being able to control house automation, being able to use a keyboard.
4157381	4167686	I think that having bionic people now, or I guess kind of cybernetic people, is...
4169761	4172242	I think it's going to change a lot of lives in the future.
4172242	4176462	We need to continue developing technology like this.
4176462	4188065	I was also reading that they now have a bionic hand that can transmit actual sensation of feeling, if not like legit touch.
4188065	4189925	So that's pretty cool.
4189925	4194866	But I mean, but still, you know, it just goes to show that
4196218	4203927	People, you know, no matter their ability level are going to want to play something and you open up that world to them, it gives them some joy.
4203927	4212977	And we need to remember that people going through various disabilities are people and they want to be happy and enjoy things just like the rest of us do.
4215699	4220560	And Civ 6 is an excellent place to use those abilities, that's for sure.
4220560	4223380	I'd imagine it would make things a lot easier.
4223380	4227421	That would be the kind of game that would lend itself best to something like that.
4227421	4228241	Oh yeah.
4228241	4240123	And reading this comment from Questbuster, if you don't care for Neuralink, other companies have been exploring BCI brain-computer interfaces for years, such as one in Australia where one of their patients used their approach to tweet in 2021.
4240123	4242564	He has since been doing more with it since then.
4244304	4255594	So yeah, that's and that's that's my whole thing is I'm like, okay, like, I'm not, I'm not gonna hate on this, because it's making, you know, again, things more accessible, you know, and what Jamie explained there is, is generally a good thing.
4255594	4258097	I just don't intend to support this particular company.
4258097	4263302	But I look at this as an industry of this is where other companies are going to go as well.
4263302	4264863	So anyway,
4266144	4274170	Alright, let's move on and talk about, unfortunately, one company that is going to no longer be able to do their thing.
4274170	4275491	Loki.
4275491	4283318	Yes, well, the Pokemon company, or Nintendo, is coming after a bunch of different fan-made things now.
4283318	4293246	So, the first to be hit is Relic Castle, which is a popular forum based off of the creation and sharing of Pokemon fan games.
4294026	4297648	And it has been taken down without warning.
4297648	4310216	There is a post on Twitter put out by RelicCastle saying, Dear Pokemon fan community, it is with heavy heart that I have to announce that RelicCastle website has been taken down following a DMCA takedown notice.
4313004	4322948	And then apparently they're going to still have their Discord available for people as of right now.
4322948	4338035	Also, weirdly enough, the Pokemon Company has requested a takedown of a seven-year-old video featuring a modded Call of Duty zombies match where they've replaced the zombies with Pikachu.
4338035	4340596	They've requested that that be taken down as well.
4342116	4350961	Well, I think I think back to the story about the lawyer last week that worked there and said, basically, he gets called attention to things when it comes across his desk.
4350961	4355604	And I that I mean, I get that the seven years old thing makes for a great headline.
4355604	4359186	But I just think, well, they just somebody finally shared it with them.
4359186	4360467	Somebody finally told them about it.
4360467	4362888	And that's how they that's how they ended up seeing it.
4362888	4363128	But I
4364329	4365650	What's the fucking point?
4365650	4366711	Like, I agree.
4366711	4375436	And I also would kind of go, isn't there like kind of parody that could go into that as well that, you know, I don't think they exactly have the right to be doing that.
4375436	4379159	But again, when a large company threatens you, what are you going to do?
4379159	4383601	And YouTube is not often sided with the creators, unfortunately.
4383601	4384862	Talked about that before.
4384862	4389825	So but man, having this whole website, you know, closed.
4389825	4393368	But the thing is, is this going to stop a single person from buying a Pokemon game?
4394586	4399229	Look, this community is still saying they're going to continue on Discord.
4399229	4401911	They're going to continue supporting all this stuff.
4401911	4403972	So does this actually change anything?
4405555	4412321	I mean, it just makes it a little harder to find, I guess they would have to, like, join the discord or something like that.
4412321	4414202	But that's not impossible.
4414202	4414923	Yeah.
4414923	4418346	And I also meant to change anything from either perspective.
4418346	4419006	You know, does.
4419006	4419727	No.
4419727	4420628	Yeah.
4420628	4426793	Is it going to be basically the Pokemon is is people are going to look at it and go, wow, what a bunch of dicks.
4426793	4428014	But is it really going to change anything?
4428823	4433025	Right, it's not because all the games weren't actually hosted on this site.
4433025	4436406	They were linked out to other sites where they're hosted.
4436406	4439007	So they're like, yeah, just use the Wayback Machine.
4439007	4441468	And it's like the site never went anywhere.
4441468	4443628	It's like, oh, bravo.
4443628	4444229	Good job.
4444229	4445289	You didn't do anything.
4445726	4450529	I will say this much though, this is my way of putting it succinctly.
4450529	4462495	Stories like these, where the legal team is just shutting these things down for apparently no reason, and until they explain themselves, which they're never gonna do, it's apparently for no reason.
4462495	4465977	This is why a lot of people out there
4467799	4475086	We're excited to play Palworld as something that completely wasn't even a game.
4475086	4485636	People were willing to believe Palworld was something that it wasn't because everybody secretly wants these fucking legal teams and stuff to get theirs.
4487216	4495729	Well, I think they also maybe want like innovation or they want something different with the Pokemon games because that's why they're playing these fan games.
4495729	4497392	It's not that they dislike Pokemon.
4497392	4500958	It's just like they dislike or maybe they want more of
4501721	4507583	the Pokemon games that they're making, or maybe they don't like the direction that they're taking those Pokemon games.
4507583	4510624	And so they're like, I don't know.
4510624	4518747	I don't think you can say that the Pokemon games don't innovate because Pokemon Go is probably one of the most innovative video games of all time.
4518747	4520047	How old is that now?
4520047	4520588	Like, come on.
4520588	4523029	But I'm saying like Pokemon puts out a bunch of different products.
4523029	4529171	But I think what you really mean is from a technical perspective, the Nintendo commitment platform holds them back.
4529171	4529831	That's what it is.
4531172	4535694	You don't get Pikachu in 4K because of the platforms that they're continuing to release on.
4535694	4537836	I mean, I don't know.
4537836	4539216	Anyway.
4539216	4539596	All right.
4539596	4546000	Well, if Pokemon isn't your thing, maybe Fortnite is kind of your thing.
4546000	4550842	And as you know, Fortnite has been through a lot of changes in the last few months.
4550842	4559267	Or I should say that there's new modes in it that make you realize that Fortnite is much more than Battle Royale, which is the game that everyone calls Fortnite.
4560047	4569275	Uh, and that includes things like Lego Fortnite, which is, you know, a lot of people have been saying it's Minecraft, but it's also kind of a survival sort of game.
4569275	4575159	I, I get not quite as much Minecraft vibes as I do dungeon quest build or dragon quest builders.
4575159	4576000	Do you remember that?
4576000	4580844	That's what Lego Fortnite feels like to me as dragon quest builders and that kind of like genre of games.
4580844	4582886	But I do like Lego Fortnite.
4582886	4586689	And of course, a lot of people like Lego Fortnite because it's still very popular.
4586689	4587870	And now this
4588470	4592753	Game mode is going to be expanding and this was something that was announced at GDC.
4592753	4602079	So we don't often get a lot of gaming news, but because this is about creating worlds and creating experiences in Fortnite, it fit the bill of something to promote at GDC.
4602079	4611685	So during Epic Unreal's keynote on March 20th, they were talking about Fortnite and Unreal and talked about how both were going to be evolving in the future.
4612365	4627461	And Epic is going to be adding tools and features to let anyone create their own big or small Lego adventures and share them online in Fortnite on all of the platforms that Fortnite is on, which is pretty much everything.
4627461	4629323	That's going to be starting on Tuesday.
4631095	4642594	Lego tools, templates, assets, they're in Fortnite's creative mode, and Unreal Editor for Fortnite or UEFN, which is the more advanced software to create these things in.
4643775	4658459	Logo Designed Islands will follow all the same rules as other user-generated content, but there are some additional rules and restrictions, because LEGO is mandating all published LEGO islands must have an ESRB rating of E10+, or lower, because it's got to be kid-friendly.
4658459	4667442	The LEGO Group is also going to take a cut of money that you make through this, so you agree to share 15% of your total island payout with the LEGO Group.
4667922	4669882	So there's something to consider there.
4669882	4674183	But I'm I'm sure there's folks that will go do their thing.
4674183	4680304	And I believe Lego kind of announced it's like a proof of concept sort of thing of this.
4680304	4685165	There's a new Cat Island, a logo or logo Lego Cat Island that's available.
4685165	4688306	That's like a different level where you go in and you play with cats.
4688306	4691246	And as somebody who likes Legos and likes cats.
4691246	4692586	Yes, this speaks to me.
4692586	4693747	I would like to try this mode.
4693747	4695647	I imagine Loki has got to be sitting there going,
4696367	4699250	I might have to try that if I can put Minecraft down for a minute.
4699250	4704975	So it's, yeah, I'll have to check that out this week at some point.
4704975	4707697	But yeah, it's continuing to expand.
4707697	4709118	So very, very interesting.
4709118	4710419	And again, I've talked about this before.
4710419	4711560	I won't repeat myself too much.
4711560	4714122	But Fortnite is not a game.
4714122	4715964	Fortnite is now a platform.
4715964	4719287	And it's very interesting to see this stuff continue to expand.
4719287	4719567	We'll see.
4719935	4728282	And it's funny because like, you know, Roblox, it's, I think that started off as like a Lego game, Lego inspired game.
4728282	4734646	And now, and now it's basically, it's like Lego type characters making, you know, obstacle courses and stuff.
4734646	4738730	And then sure enough, this, this video that they're talking about, Hey, start building your own Lego islands.
4738730	4742633	The first thing that, Hey, you can make obstacle courses or Hey, we like to be cool.
4742633	4744594	Like the kids, we're going to call them Obbies.
4744594	4746496	You can make Obbies.
4746496	4747897	We speak in the language kids.
4748437	4750179	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S
4772457	4783822	Lael, did you ever play a lot of the shinobi games especially that came out later like on Saturn?
4783822	4785802	Only the old school arcade games.
4785802	4787243	I never played the Saturn ones to be honest.
4789371	4801622	Shinobi Legions, also known in Japan as Shin Shinobi Den, and in Europe as Shinobi X, because everything had an X in the name.
4801622	4812632	Whale, there is a cheat code in Shinobi Legions discovered by Beau Bales, the Saturn hacker, that has a debug mode.
4812632	4813613	It activates a debug.
4814253	4819417	but it's gonna require 40 buttons to make this happen.
4819417	4835347	So the steps to do it require, get ready, go to the options screen, navigate to music, select stage 2-3, navigate to sound effect and select 0-6.
4835347	4840431	Navigate to audio and hold L while putting in this 40 button sequence.
4841647	4856424	A button 10 times, X once, B 3, Y once, C 6, Z once, X 10 times, A once, Y 3 times, B once, Z 6 times, C once.
4856424	4858666	Exit the options screen and start a new game.
4858666	4861830	If you did it correctly, you can press the R button to bring up a menu.
4862290	4867492	with Level Select to change your lives and continues, boost your life bar, all kinds of stuff.
4867492	4874334	You'll be able to hold L, R, and Z to move the protagonist freely without collision.
4874334	4887718	Um... So yeah, it will, um... There's a patch out there too that if you, uh, like, select a button, it'll just automatically activate the debug mode.
4887718	4890359	So, um... There you go.
4890359	4891279	But yeah, it's a...
4893109	4893829	It's there!
4893829	4900231	Now we know how to do it for real without any external stuff, but apparently, so I made it easy.
4900231	4901011	Alright.
4901011	4905912	I was trying to see if Kotaku had written a guide yet on how to unlock the debug mode in Shinobi Legions.
4905912	4908113	I don't- they don't have one yet!
4908113	4912494	They're- they're by- Kotaku, that's not how you're gonna win!
4912494	4913714	Just sayin'.
4913714	4914754	Hmm.
4914754	4917715	Why aren't you on top of the Shin-Shinobi Den stuff, huh, huh, huh, huh?
4918792	4929300	Anyway, but still, in all seriousness, always love these stories about discovering like old things or excuse me, new things and old games is really cool, especially the one.
4929300	4931041	What was the one a few weeks ago?
4931041	4939748	It was like you could completely like put the PlayStation into like debug mode and flip the disc out and all this stuff was buried in like an old alien game that was on PlayStation.
4939748	4940829	That was so cool.
4940829	4942811	So, yeah, I like that a lot of this stuff kind of gets found.
4942811	4947914	Of course, a lot of this is from I think some people like go so far as to like decompile the games and find this stuff.
4947914	4948055	But
4950255	4965080	I was actually watching someone today, I'll have to find the video again, where he had to completely reverse engineer a code key thing for a game that no longer had the box.
4966280	4971805	that isn't being supported anymore, so there's no way to get a new code to play the game.
4971805	4984097	And he created some script that lets you go into how the authenticator on it works, and the numbers that it checks for, and what you have to have in order to make it work.
4984818	4986359	And it was pretty amazing.
4986359	4989581	I mean, a little bit was over over my head.
4989581	4993124	I was a little better at following now that I'm starting some coding.
4993124	5000429	But but it was kind of kind of neat what people are doing so they can play their old games again, too.
5000429	5001529	All right.
5001529	5005852	Well, let's move on a few more stories before we get to another classic game in our regular segment.
5005852	5007834	But first, we're going to go over to Loki.
5008686	5023356	Well, this is not great, but apparently Bloomberg is saying that Sony has paused production on the PlayStation VR 2 because it's produced 2 million units and is having trouble selling them.
5023356	5031922	Sales are declining each quarter according to the International Data Corporation and, you know,
5033362	5040593	I think, you know, obviously it's because it's expensive and it also requires you to buy a PlayStation 5 which is also expensive.
5040593	5044719	And so you don't have the must-have games on PlayStation VR.
5047287	5053812	And so why make the over $1,000 investment to play some games in VR?
5053812	5070606	Hopefully, though, they're going to be supporting PC very soon, because I did see there is an article talking about how Sony has enabled NVIDIA support for the PlayStation VR 2 using the DP auxiliary emulator and a modified EDID.
5070606	5074549	I don't know what the hell that means, but it sounds like that they're working on
5075530	5102336	getting PC support to work someone which is legit a great idea they could save this hardware is getting it to run with PCs as well because unfortunately the must have utility doesn't exist on PlayStation and it seems very clear it's not coming so that's you know I'm surprised it took this long for this story to come to kind of come down the pipeline where they're they're having to scale back how much they're making this because there's there's not a lot of reason to buy one currently
5102776	5103276	You know what I mean?
5103276	5113922	Like, you're either buying one to play stuff they already announced some time ago and released, so maybe... But otherwise, you know, what's Sony doing now for this device?
5113922	5118565	Yeah, it's a hard... It's starting to feel like yet another Sony abandoned piece of hardware.
5118565	5123088	By the way, happy birthday to the PSP, which was released 19 years ago.
5123088	5131573	It's a hard sell just because, like, I like the PlayStation VR, or at least I like playing the games on it, but yeah, it's...
5132668	5142822	It's hard making that that sell now for these games considering that there's not really that many exclusives and the ones that are like playable on multiple platforms.
5142822	5146066	You can play that on a cheaper device.
5146066	5146607	It's just
5147728	5152691	And I don't know if it's that can it could be that night and day different as far as quality goes.
5152691	5157053	Like, am I going to get a better gameplay experience on the PlayStation VR 2?
5157053	5160475	I don't know if that's the case, but yeah, it's it's a tough sell right now.
5160475	5166099	And it also sucks that it doesn't play original PlayStation VR games, which kind of hobbled this thing.
5166099	5166819	Yes.
5166819	5168200	And I understand before y'all.
5168740	5170362	Correct me and explain it to me.
5170362	5178111	I understand why it doesn't play the original because of the complete change in the way that it senses the environment around you and all that.
5178111	5182956	But that just goes to show the original decision wasn't very future proofed.
5184077	5200186	So it just kind of sucks that, you know, the original library isn't playable, which, again, even the great software that's out there for original PlayStation VR doesn't really work with VR 2 unless the developers, like, you know, which they did with No Man's Sky and a few other games, actually upgraded it.
5200846	5204790	And Bobby in chat says, I love the PSVR 2 hardware.
5204790	5206091	It just has no software.
5206091	5207132	Yeah, that's it.
5207132	5217962	Like I remember going to your house and checking out PSVR 2, which if I'm not mistaking on your show tonight said was probably the last time you actually used that thing.
5217962	5218983	Maybe one time since.
5219944	5224907	But in all seriousness, yeah, I enjoyed the the I keep calling it a demo.
5224907	5226208	I didn't think it was like a full game.
5226208	5230090	The Horizon demo, the old proof of concept thing that we were playing.
5230090	5231691	I thought it was neat.
5231691	5240556	But yeah, it just it was no like must have killer thing for VR and like Beat Saber's kind of lived its life at this point.
5240556	5242277	You know, what's what's next?
5242277	5245619	Show us that compelling future for VR in gaming.
5248257	5251158	Half-Life Alyx, but Half-Life Alyx is kind of limited to one thing.
5251158	5256639	So I don't think yeah, so it's just, I don't know.
5256639	5263141	But yeah, as Joan Hunter Matt says, then need that PC update to help supplement them until they get those PSVR 2 games out.
5263141	5270682	And Bobby says, I do believe that if I could use my PSVR 2 on my PC, the games would look better than they do on my Valve Index.
5270682	5273243	And the PSVR 2 is technically cheaper than a Valve Index.
5274099	5274719	Excellent point.
5274719	5275740	Yeah, that would be cool.
5275740	5276841	Yeah, it really would.
5276841	5281564	So that does seem to be kind of the hardware saving direction for this product.
5281564	5292151	So it might even make me interested in one, to be quite honest, because the fact that I could have something that could play PC stuff and work on PlayStation is actually kind of like, oh, OK, now we're talking.
5292151	5292611	Right.
5292611	5295413	So we'll see what happens.
5295413	5296354	Anyway, in the meantime,
5297273	5300214	Let's move on and talk about Street Fighter 6.
5300214	5302995	Not a game I believe is played in VR at all.
5302995	5304895	But Street Fighter 6 is still going.
5304895	5314117	You know, it's been out for a little bit, but we are now talking about rumors and leaks for Season 2 DLC.
5314117	5320419	Apparently, the leaker who accurately leaked the entire Street Fighter 6 roster before it was revealed.
5320419	5321940	Remember when that was a big issue?
5321940	5323500	Capcom not happy about that.
5323700	5324260	M Bison VEGA
5351398	5366327	Some other characters, maybe not from Street Fighter 2, but some people will still be happy to hear about, R. Mika, or Rainbow Mika, who is a pro wrestler in Street Fighter Alpha 3, and then got a redesign in Street Fighter 5, also rumored to be a part of this pack.
5366327	5373591	And then, also, we have Sakura, which I'm sure will make our very own DarkSakura happy.
5373591	5376673	And of course, Sakura, of course, debuted in Street Fighter 2 Alpha.
5377673	5380075	and Elena also for this pack.
5380075	5381876	Oh, Elena's fun.
5381876	5382116	Yeah.
5382116	5383917	She was from Street Fighter 3.
5383917	5384658	You were not already.
5384658	5385759	She's the leggy girl.
5385759	5386619	Yes.
5386619	5390182	And the sixth character is supposed to be a brand new character.
5390182	5392843	There is no name provided as of yet.
5392843	5396826	So just that the sixth character is not going to be one that you actually know.
5396826	5398227	Somebody that's going to be brand new.
5398227	5400028	So there you go.
5400028	5405912	Bobby Blackwolf says the day that M. Bison graced the new Street Fighter was the greatest day of your life.
5405912	5407133	But for him, it was a Tuesday.
5409194	5415058	All right, well, while we're talking about old games, I think it's a great time to segue into our next segment.
5415058	5415779	So here we go.
5445126	5452873	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5452873	5456055	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5456055	5458417	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for us this week?
5458417	5463622	I picked a game called The Dungeon Revealed.
5464441	5470445	And any old Mac gamer should know this one.
5470445	5477631	So it was a dungeon crawl game that was created by John Raymonds and published by Woodrow's Editions in 1987.
5477631	5488138	It is the enhanced commercial release of another game that Raymonds played called The Dungeon of Doom that came out of Shareware in 1985.
5491361	5494283	And there's some more about this.
5494283	5501589	The games were released for Mac OS and were compatible all the way up to System 7.
5501589	5506553	So I believe that the video that us here live are watching is a System 6 version.
5506553	5511838	So at any rate, you have a character that is trapped in a dungeon underground.
5512839	5521870	And if you attempt to take stairs from the dungeon, you get a message that says, a force prevents you from escaping to the surface.
5521870	5526055	Maybe the orb will set you free.
5526055	5527676	And so it's a...
5529018	5531760	It's kind of vague, isn't it?
5531760	5542067	So, at any rate, you have 40 floors, and each of them have a staircase going up and a staircase going down.
5542067	5544529	The floor plan is randomly generated.
5545429	5553614	And through each of those levels it gets to be more and more complicated to navigate through it, very maze-like.
5553614	5560498	You also can find some armor and magic accoutrements, potions, wands, weapons.
5561218	5567622	All kinds of stuff that you find through the dungeons, little areas that you're searching through.
5567622	5577068	You also have monsters, depending on their circumstances, they can also be more aggro or less aggro.
5577068	5582891	And you have to eat, so that you don't starve to death.
5582891	5587795	And of course, as you go further and further, the monsters become stronger and stronger.
5589776	5596140	So you have, when you start your game, you can pick one of seven classes.
5596140	5598282	You might laugh as much as I did the last one.
5598282	5600723	I even laughed when it was new.
5600723	5605467	Knight, Fighter, Sage, Wizard, Alchemist, Jeweler, and Jones!
5605467	5608288	You can be a Jones.
5608288	5615593	Everyone has their own attributes, very D&D-like in how they're assigned.
5618164	5633672	But as far as each of these other ones, they all have this ability to access one type of object.
5633672	5640035	Like an alchemist can identify potions, so they can avoid the poison.
5640035	5643016	Wizards can have wands, stuff like that.
5648288	5657170	The Jones... I'm trying to see if I can find what it was The Jones did.
5657170	5662831	I think that they're just the standard, but it's been a moment, I'll have to look them up.
5662831	5676894	But at any rate, each class has a different kind of likelihood to find a certain kind of item, and you improve your ability scores as you go along, very D&D-like.
5679452	5688717	But, as far as the original game, Dungeon of Doom... Yeah, don't shoot food orange, right?
5688717	5698102	It was basically John Raymond made the game to teach himself C, and because he did not like the Mac port of Ultima II.
5698102	5700003	I kinda like this game, I'm gonna make my own.
5700003	5700384	Bye!
5701905	5715614	and he released it anyway as Shareware in 1985 but had no payments really by 1987 even though it had become one of the most popular games on the Mac at the time.
5715614	5730744	So he said, well, screw that and upgraded the game and decided to have it published by Woodrow's Editions in 87 and retitled it The Dungeon Revealed.
5732024	5746411	The gameplay was pretty much the same, but the enhancements had some new sounds, hidden vaults, gatekeepers at the stairs, new items, and then he also put the source code out there that could be purchased by registered buyers.
5746411	5753295	And he also did a final version of the Dungeon of Doom that basically
5754295	5765438	changed none of the code since version 4 was out, but reclassified this as a free demo for the dungeon revealed.
5765438	5776480	Macworld had inducted Dungeon of Doom into the 1987 Macworld Game Hall of Fame in the Roleplay Game category.
5776480	5779041	The runner-up to this was The Seven Cities of Gold.
5780481	5791228	And they also named Dungeon of Doom as the best implementation of Rogue in 2D maze game in its Shareware and Public Domain Game Awards the same year.
5791228	5798993	Mac user rated the game a 4 out of 5, calling it a standard adventure in the Ultima series genre.
5798993	5802715	And there you go, I mean, it's black and white, you know.
5803339	5806623	This is what our games were like on the Mac back then.
5820151	5829617	Even though I didn't have a Mac as a kid or, you know, in the 80s, we had one at school.
5829617	5844325	And I remember people sneaking this game onto that computer, you know, and, you know, my friends playing this game, my friends who had more money than me.
5844325	5849168	So I definitely, I didn't remember the,
5850402	5856825	When I saw the Jones thing listed again, I was like, oh, I kind of remember that, but I still don't remember what they do.
5856825	5862347	And it wasn't listed here and just like, I get to be a Jones.
5862347	5863428	Um, QuestBuster.
5863428	5865569	My daddy was a Jones.
5865569	5872792	QuestBuster comments on this game saying the simple fun or it's simple fun that still holds up, especially if you're something of a roguelike fan.
5872792	5874673	Yeah, definitely big rogue vibes off this game.
5875373	5875993	Crystal Quest?
5875993	5876393	Crystal Quest?
5876393	5876653	Crystal Quest?
5904005	5908128	Not Crystal Maze, that was a TV show.
5908128	5908929	But yeah, Crystal Quest.
5908929	5912171	It came out on the Apple IIe before.
5912171	5914473	I mean, there's been a Game Boy version, too.
5914473	5916174	Oh, wow.
5916174	5918075	I just remember the Mac one, to be honest.
5918075	5919556	So.
5919556	5919777	All right.
5919777	5921318	Well, anyway.
5921318	5926401	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5926401	5927822	The Dungeon Revealed.
5927822	5930865	Maybe Crystal Quest will get its time in the future.
5930865	5931165	We'll see.
5932062	5935064	All right, we still have some headlines to get to.
5935064	5938066	So let's do some rapid fire news.
5938066	5941168	And we'll start with Loki.
5941168	5947472	Spokesperson for Larian Studios has said that, hey, we're done with Baldur's Gate 3.
5947472	5949994	We're not developing anymore for it.
5949994	5953256	And we're moving on from Baldur's Gate and Dungeons and Dragons.
5953256	5958279	So they're going to be working on a new IP.
5958279	5960901	We don't know what it is, but it's not going to be Baldur's Gate.
5961610	5965294	Honestly good for them being able to make a power move like that at this point.
5965294	5976925	So many studios kind of get stuck into doing sequel upon sequel and, you know, Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the most award winningest games there's been in quite some time and I love that they can just be like, you know what?
5977625	5979326	We want to go do something new.
5979326	5980546	Yeah, I mean, fair enough.
5980546	5981667	They should.
5981667	5989790	And then we have the release date now for the Final Fantasy 14's final DLC.
5989790	5992150	Or is it 16?
5992150	5992170	16.
5992170	5993351	16, my mistake.
5993351	5995372	16's final DLC.
5995372	5999773	That is going to be Rising Tide.
5999773	6004055	It's going to unravel the mystery behind the icon of water.
6005126	6005966	April 18 Expansion Pass
6019425	6026708	I will just quickly mention, since you brought up Final Fantasy XIV, they released a lot of info on that at PAX East this weekend.
6026708	6028269	And Dawn Trail has a date.
6028269	6033611	It's going to be playable on June 28th if you pre-order it, which most fans of the game are going to do that.
6033611	6038873	So I don't know why they bothered to have two release dates, but June 28th will be the date for most people.
6038873	6044575	It looks to be very heavily Final Fantasy IX inspired based on the pre-order bonuses and those sorts of things.
6044575	6046796	So we're not quite sure how yet.
6047256	6052800	But then also related to this, Loki, the Final Fantasy XVI x XIV event.
6052800	6055041	So the XVI event in XIV.
6055041	6058163	Yes, that's the thing is going to be it looks like next month.
6058163	6059484	So in April, that'll be fun.
6060720	6070363	So what's up with the whole like double currency thing with the Xbox version that you can buy like a special current coin in order to pay for your services, which is stupid.
6070363	6071664	Okay, it's weird.
6071664	6074785	So the Xbox version officially released this week.
6074785	6084188	And so the only way you can pay for your subscription on Xbox, if you only have an Xbox license, is to use these Xbox coins that you buy through the store.
6084608	6088792	which is essentially Microsoft getting a cut of that one way or another.
6088792	6101984	So I'm not sure the why behind it because it definitely kind of looks silly when it's put side by side with the PS4 and 5 version and the PC version why you have this, but you know, it's going to enable some people to play the game that haven't been able to before.
6102744	6115897	An interesting point I saw raised elsewhere is that in some territories, certain ones in South America, Central America, this will make Final Fantasy XIV more affordable than it is today.
6115897	6119000	But meanwhile, most people in the US, Europe, etc.
6119000	6125306	are kind of razzing the team because you have to have an Xbox Game Pass account
6125686	6126627	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
6147324	6149665	Don't go to that edition.
6149665	6152627	Use the free edition to see if you like the game.
6152627	6162292	And then if you decide you like the game and you want the restrictions to move, then go to the starter edition, because otherwise you're missing out on being able to play a good chunk of the game for free.
6162292	6168756	So, yeah, I think this is a really silly and a lot of people are like, what the hell are they doing with Final Fantasy on Xbox?
6168756	6174579	I think it's a little ridiculous, but if it gets even a handful of new people into the game, then cool, I guess.
6174579	6175720	But was it worth the effort?
6176340	6178302	I don't know, but I can't imagine it was much.
6178302	6182405	I mean, the game already runs on PCs very well.
6182405	6189650	And, you know, like when you put an Xbox controller in the PC, it has all the Xbox labelings anyway.
6189650	6190911	So.
6190911	6191431	Right.
6191431	6191972	Yeah.
6191972	6192332	I don't know.
6192332	6193132	Whatever.
6193132	6193493	Anyway.
6193493	6194033	Sorry.
6194033	6197235	A little diversion there, but I noticed it was nowhere else in the show.
6197235	6198797	I thought I'd bring it up.
6198797	6199177	DarkSakura.
6201335	6210409	Well, a game that I certainly love is going to be coming out for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 9th.
6210409	6211731	It's Rainbow Cotton.
6212631	6223123	which is the, I would say the successor to Panorama Cotton, the rare one for the Mega Drive slash Genesis.
6223123	6230110	This is a remake of the one that came out for Dreamcast, which was released on January 20th, 2000 in Japan.
6232112	6237678	never got an American release.
6237678	6243465	You can play the original Dreamcast version or you can play an enhanced version.
6243465	6249231	It will have a rumble and speaker support for your controllers.
6249231	6251974	Cotton will be, of course, in full glorious 3D.
6253095	6258736	We also have a little sibling mode where you can play as Cotton and Silk together.
6258736	6260937	Silk usually floats around with her.
6260937	6263698	It's a little fairy friend.
6263698	6266859	But you can actually play as Silk.
6266859	6275081	And then not only can you listen to the original Japanese with subtitles,
6278709	6284913	They will also have subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and German.
6293857	6298579	It's a complete remaster.
6298579	6299560	Everything's going to be pretty.
6299560	6301561	It has all the stuff in it.
6301561	6310645	And they also, though, have, like I said, you can play the original one and that one is emulated to be exactly like it was.
6310645	6311286	So.
6311286	6311546	All right.
6312026	6313146	I love this game.
6313146	6319629	We imported this the moment I heard it was coming out, because it was the only way I could get something like panorama cotton at the time.
6319629	6322169	And it's adorable.
6322169	6330752	Like, I love the bonus rounds are still the same as they were in the other cotton games where you have to collect tea, tea cups.
6330752	6333513	And she goes, hello.
6333513	6337094	And, you know, subjugates fairies to do her bidding.
6337094	6339155	Who doesn't like to subjugate a fairy to do their bidding?
6340811	6342532	All right, sounds like a fun Friday night.
6342532	6342872	All right.
6342872	6347595	Anyway, let's talk about a follow up to something from last week's show.
6347595	6351878	We were joking about Team 0% and their journey on Super Mario Maker.
6351878	6358982	They may have to call themselves Team 0.001% because there's this one level they weren't able to beat.
6358982	6359783	Well, guess what?
6359783	6361244	Did they beat the level this week?
6362188	6366411	No, but they're claiming victory anyway because of a technicality.
6366411	6382162	Here's the thing, the one level that they were still unable to beat called Trimming the Herbs, you might remember that was the level they were trying to beat after time and time and time again, it was revealed this week that the creator had cheated and was able to upload the game to the server
6382962	6386865	Even though they hadn't actually beaten the level themselves.
6386865	6390747	So the level was confirmed to be a fake.
6390747	6400174	The level's creator owned up, Ahoyo was the level's creator's name, owned up to the fact that it was an illegitimate level and somehow was still able to be uploaded to the servers.
6400174	6401655	And they basically talk about that it was
6402861	6407365	ToolAssisted, or I don't know how they did it, but they cheated to get the level on the server.
6407365	6409948	And that's that.
6409948	6415573	But so this thing has been sitting on the server since 2017.
6415573	6419216	So no idea why it wasn't flagged sooner.
6419216	6426143	But yeah, so now because it has been officially unveiled that this level was a fraud,
6426763	6426964	I mean...
6455504	6457848	I feel that they should have still beaten it.
6457848	6462314	I mean, but, but, but they should have beat it with a TAS.
6462314	6463956	So just like, you know, just.
6465174	6466335	Fight fire with fire.
6490225	6494087	granted it's seven years later, but maybe they've done a lot of growing up in seven years.
6494087	6496329	I know I feel like I have too.
6496329	6501352	So you know, maybe they saw that this was in the news and they came clean on this.
6501352	6504674	So I'll at least say hey, glad they did that.
6504674	6512599	So these folks that were working so hard to get the 0% could feel good about the fact that they actually did do it.
6512599	6512939	All right.
6513579	6526234	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are coming out a little sooner to hopefully replace the hole that Mario Maker Wii U might be leaving in your heart.
6526234	6527155	Yeah, let's start with the US.
6527878	6529559	We've got a few things.
6529559	6534161	So starting off on PC, we have Boomer Road.
6534161	6538924	Also, Not A Lot, which is a robot game.
6538924	6556393	And then my favorite of these three games, Doronko Wanko, which is a game where you play as a Pomeranian and you imagine Splatoon, but with a Pomeranian and you're trying to mess up a house and make it as dirty as possible.
6556393	6556793	Sounds fun.
6557512	6562314	I take the wanko would be like the one one you know like the bark sound that a dog makes in Japanese.
6563628	6568732	Possibly, but it looks adorable and now I have to wishlist it because it is on Steam.
6568732	6570133	So those are coming out this week.
6570133	6579180	We've got Bulwark Falconeer Chronicles on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6579180	6584324	Grandia HD Collection on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6584324	6587787	Planet Zoo on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
6589042	6599129	South Park Snow Day on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Amiro Chocolate on Nintendo Switch
6600194	6622320	Mars2120 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series OpenRoads on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Peppergrinder on PC and Nintendo Switch We've got, let's see...
6627248	6631884	It's like Chia, Tachia on PC and that's it.
6634821	6638982	Sorry, I was muted for a minute there, but I'm now obsessed with this trailer for this.
6638982	6639562	What is this?
6639562	6645744	Duranco Wonko, where yes, we're watching the little dog and sorry, sorry to those that are on the podcast feed, but you can look up the trailer.
6645744	6651826	It's on YouTube where we're watching this itty bitty cute little Pomeranian dog just fuck up this entire house.
6651826	6653787	That sounds like a Pomeranian, though.
6653787	6655467	I kind of need to play.
6655467	6658408	This is what Nintendogs should have been, to be quite honest.
6659368	6661288	In Japan, on the 26th, South Park Snow Day.
6661288	6664069	Also on the Nintendo Switch, on the 28th, Radirigi 2.
6686595	6690159	Regular and Limited Edition Prominstar Winning Post 10 2024
6704775	6717642	Mirochocolate is also out in Japan this week, and let's see, Muv Luv also gets a 20th Odyssey limited edition multi-language box.
6717642	6721184	I'm almost positive this game has come out before, so I'm thinking this is some type of box.
6721184	6725107	Oh yeah, it's Muv Luv and Muv Luv Alternative, so it's a couple games all in one.
6725107	6728248	We also have Aquarium coming out in Japan on the 28th.
6729750	6734654	and let's look at the PlayStation 5 real quick and see what releases are there.
6734654	6739739	As expected, the South Park Snow Day is out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 5.
6739739	6744584	Ratatouille 2 is out there as well as Winning Post 10 2024.
6744584	6745965	And that's it.
6745965	6748888	Everything else I mentioned is only for Switch.
6748888	6749749	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
6751425	6752785	That's a handful of things.
6752785	6757967	On the 26th for the main four, we have South Park Snow Day.
6757967	6766129	On the 28th, we have on Switch, we have World War Z or World War Zed.
6766129	6770350	Also on the 28th for Switch, Outward Definitive Edition.
6770350	6773791	And then on PlayStation Switch on the 29th, we have Pocket Bravery.
6776011	6783476	Alright, we have a few more news stories for you and then we'll see if you all have any questions for us as if we haven't taken enough tangents tonight.
6783476	6786538	But what's the problem with a few more?
6786538	6789340	So we'll go over to Loki with another headline.
6790151	6792392	Yeah, apparently.
6792392	6800534	Well, it's I think it's been reported anonymously because they haven't said it yet from Rockstar Games.
6800534	6809097	But allegedly there is rumors that Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be delayed into 2026.
6809097	6813738	And the reason for that is that they're behind schedule in as far as development goes.
6813738	6819740	And that is their claiming due to the lack of people returning to office.
6821533	6823074	I don't believe that, but whatever.
6823074	6837062	I mean, so, you know, there right now, employees are worried that they're going to have to get back into a crunch type of style of development, as is typical with these types of games.
6837062	6849110	But, you know, hopefully they said internally, it's pushing it back to late 2025 or 2026, maybe a possibility.
6849110	6851111	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.
6852196	6853497	They're fine with waiting.
6853497	6854637	The reason is very silly.
6854637	6856858	Yeah, at the, you know, here we go.
6856858	6858079	Cue the quote.
6858079	6859279	The bad game is bad.
6859279	6860960	The good game is good forever.
6860960	6862601	You know, you don't know the drill.
6862601	6872545	If the delay is what needs to happen to keep the workers happy and healthy, this game is still going to sell billions of copies when it comes out.
6872545	6874586	Okay, maybe not that many, but still, it's going to break records.
6874586	6877227	But it's not about keeping the employees happy.
6877227	6879168	It's about keeping the shareholders happy.
6881001	6885064	And so we'll have to see what the shareholders want because they know best.
6885064	6893669	The shareholders better be watching what else happens in the industry with rushed games if they want to learn to fuck or mismanaged games because there's many of them out there you can draw from.
6893669	6902835	So like I would I would highly encourage because I'm sure this game is going to be chock full of ways to nickel and dime the audience with whatever they've got planned for Grand Theft 6 online.
6902835	6903895	It's going to be bad.
6903895	6906937	Don't fuck it up or you're going to lose everything.
6906937	6907658	Don't fuck it up.
6909892	6914509	Alright, last headline tonight is a bit of sad news, DarkSakura.
6916112	6922154	Yeah, so, um, the main character designer, um, for all the Tales games has died.
6922154	6930456	Um, Inomata Mutsumi, who, uh, did, uh, all the artwork, the character designs for those games.
6930456	6935398	It was on, uh, Sunday, March 10th, age 63.
6935398	6938458	And, um, it was apparently very sudden.
6938458	6942019	There were sketches that were left behind.
6942019	6943680	Um, and, uh,
6945544	6952366	She, uh, yeah, it was just really, really, uh, very quick and tragic for the family.
6952366	6954667	My heart goes out to the family.
6954667	6954887	Yeah.
6954887	6957308	What a, what a legendary gaming series as well.
6957308	6959589	This is a very, very sad news indeed to hear.
6959589	6959649	So.
6959649	6961769	Yeah.
6961769	6963270	RIP for sure.
6963270	6963890	All right.
6963890	6965450	Uh, and that's a very young age.
6965450	6967851	I know it doesn't seem young, but it's young.
6967851	6970372	So, um, it's very sad to hear that that was sudden.
6971857	6978682	Alright, well, hopefully on a happier note, we're going to get to your calls and questions and so forth in our listener roundtable.
6978682	6984607	If you would like to give us a call, you sure can on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com.
6984607	6989511	We usually take a moment to check in with any emails over at participate at orangelandradio.com.
6989511	6991812	I don't think we had any, but let me just double check.
6991812	6992873	Not a one.
6992873	6993394	Not a one.
6993394	6993614	Okay.
6994014	6999078	So if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLingerie.com is the place to do it.
6999078	7004021	I guess once in a while I should actually check Twitter to see if we're getting tweeted anything, but I don't know.
7004021	7010846	Usually it's just spam when I go in there, so we'll see.
7010846	7013348	Oh.
7013348	7016069	There was something in there, but it's, yeah, I'll have to respond.
7016069	7018091	See, this is what I get for not checking Twitter enough.
7020063	7026345	So anyways, that's that's it, I guess.
7026345	7033427	So I'm going to open it up to Discord over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord if you'd like to give us a call.
7033427	7038328	Otherwise, Loki, do we happen to have any last minute stories?
7038328	7038888	Not really.
7038888	7044730	I mean, Stardew Valley got a major update recently to 1.6.
7044730	7045050	I don't know.
7045050	7045750	I don't follow.
7045750	7049231	I haven't played Stardew Valley in a long time, but it sounds cool.
7052694	7056316	That's all I got.
7056316	7058157	All right.
7058157	7064840	Um, let's see.
7064840	7071063	Um, I'm looking for a few different things, but I didn't really find too much myself.
7071063	7072683	Yeah, that's all right.
7072683	7079847	I felt like there was still like, mainly some bigger things going on this week, especially considering the last couple weeks, but it was also GDC happened this week.
7079847	7079967	So
7081601	7088061	Even though we don't usually get a ton of news out of that, usually when the industry gets together, there's some interesting things that happen, so we did have a couple headlines out of that.
7089141	7093382	Alright, well then with that, I won't draw it out any longer than it needs to be.
7093382	7095182	We'll go ahead and wrap it up for the night.
7095182	7102564	But we look forward to seeing everybody else back here next week for episode number 998, as we inch closer and closer to 1,000 weekly episodes.
7102564	7106005	Thank you again, I really can't stress that enough for being a part of it.
7106005	7113546	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight, please tell a friend or two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7113546	7116187	So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes,
7116827	7121010	or Spotify or wherever it is you found this podcast goes an awful long way.
7121010	7123752	So we really appreciate it.
7123752	7125653	Let's go around and get final thoughts at this point.
7125653	7130316	DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight.
7130316	7132137	Words.
7132137	7137280	Oh, and I'm going to be old after OLR is old.
7137280	7139882	Yeah, April's a big month, isn't it?
7139882	7141163	Yep.
7141163	7142183	All right.
7142183	7143184	Well, have a good stream tonight.
7144551	7145251	Okay, bye.
7145251	7145871	Bye.
7145871	7148192	Okay.
7148192	7148792	I will.
7148792	7152333	I look forward to seeing everybody and I have some things to talk about.
7152333	7153753	So, yeah.
7153753	7154394	All right.
7154394	7155954	Bye.
7155954	7157374	Loki, we'll then go to you.
7157374	7159815	You have your final thought for tonight?
7159815	7160895	I'm busy.
7160895	7161496	Getting busy.
7161496	7166437	Hopefully, I'm hoping to finish up that first ride this week.
7166437	7166717	Hoping.
7167162	7168763	Good times.
7168763	7174287	My final thought for tonight is I took the shrink wrap off my Final Fantasy VII Rebirth finally.
7174287	7186416	So I think the streams are going to start this week after me waiting for a little bit so that people that are very, very spoiler averse kind of have enough time to get through or at least get a lot further in the game than I'll be when I start streaming it this week.
7186416	7188417	So please look forward to that.
7188417	7191600	I'm excited to jump in and play because I've heard a lot of good things about it.
7191600	7194842	And I've heard it's very easy to get distracted for a very long time.
7194842	7195663	So we'll see how that goes.
7196523	7202467	But anyway, thank you again, of course, for listening to our show and being here and supporting it, whether it was on the podcast feed or live.
7202467	7206989	We really appreciate you and we will be back to do it all again in just seven days.
7206989	7210211	Bobby Blackwolf has let us know he will not be here next week live.
7210211	7213313	So we'll be starting right at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock.
7213313	7217075	Do not be alarmed if you don't see Bobby next week for the folks that are here live.
7217075	7219336	It's just going to go right into our show at the normal time.
7219336	7220577	So we'll see you then.
7220577	7222778	In the meantime, have a great week, everybody.
