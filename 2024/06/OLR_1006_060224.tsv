9907	20576	Not content to only lament over his love interest that the spiny king could never realize, Jack Black is slated to take on the role of the only character who has a proper noun in Minecraft, at least that I know of, until I watch the series and learn new ones.
21076	21417	Steve.
21777	22758	He's voicing Steve.
23258	26501	Many other actors and actresses have been announced, but few yet with named roles.
27242	28803	This is the Mainstream Pixel Art Headline.
29003	34308	Now it's time for your hosts, Rub Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about their story and more in two weeks of gaming news.
34608	36890	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
40168	47610	Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47710	58113	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live and back once again here on June 2nd, 2024, with episode number 1006 of our show.
58173	60013	We are back after a week off.
60213	62074	Sorry, my bad, I went out of town.
62574	67675	But I hope you all had a good, long weekend, at least here in the States it was a long weekend.
68435	70157	I'm tangled in my headset, so I need a few.
70297	71858	And I have homemade soup.
97287	98608	Hmm, homemade soup.
98768	101251	And yes, my headset is the same way.
101291	103533	It gets like Christmas lights trying to untangle.
103913	112081	And a little Twitch trick, you probably noticed I tend to put the cord behind me so that I don't have it dangling in front of me during the stream.
112841	113762	We're doing this live.
114362	119965	And when we do things live, sometimes I get a little belchy because I'm chugging a diet soda before we go live.
120406	131632	That's the fun about doing a live internet show because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
131652	134394	That's VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
134854	141178	Well, while Dark Sakura enjoys her soup, and I will be curious what flavor, let's say hello to Loki.
142025	142306	Hello.
142608	143371	Hi, how are you, Loki?
144214	144797	I'm doing pretty good.
144817	146002	Did you enjoy the long weekend?
147994	149955	It was just not very long.
149975	151736	It still felt very short.
151956	152997	Yeah, no, I hear that.
153477	155919	I think it was more like the weekend flew by for me.
155939	159902	Of course, I was out of town, so it's kind of like nonstop go, go, go, and that's what happens when you're out of town.
160342	166567	But I would say almost like the better perk was a shorter work week because then it was an abbreviated four-day work week.
166607	171950	Now, granted, that means five days worth of meetings in four days, but you make it work, and it just makes everything go by faster.
171971	172671	Yeah.
173552	178955	Since we do tape live and we have the video that plays over at VOG Network, sorry, it is not on the YouTube.
178975	182498	That's an exclusive thing for our Twitch people and our Twitch subscribers.
183218	185319	You can watch, of course, free on Sunday nights.
185399	190263	But if you want to see our video library, that is something we ask that you subscribe to the channel for.
191023	192544	Sorry, but it is a bonus thing.
192584	194666	The podcast has been free for 22 years.
194786	195866	The video is just a little bonus.
196347	198408	But I do try to describe what's going on on the video.
198788	201030	And Loki has games that play behind him.
201050	202511	And I'm almost positive.
203131	208554	This is a ha-gay reference here because it is June.
208574	210255	It is, of course.
210315	211096	We have to.
211196	212036	Loki is, of course.
212056	213517	I don't know if you've ever seen that TikTok.
213537	218760	You know, DarkSakura and myself are members of the LGBTQIA family, as we've been very open about here on the show.
219120	223603	But Loki is, I don't know if you've ever seen that girl in the TikTok video that goes, ally.
224043	224724	That's Loki.
225024	226224	He's the ally.
226244	226885	Yeah.
227425	251536	and uh I can't remember her name somebody's got to know that TikTok I'm talking about because it's infamous but anyway Loki's being a good ally tonight and uh I believe that's Robot Unicorn Attack playing behind you tonight isn't it oh it's the second game oh did they still use the same Erasure song or did they like I think they had the Erasure song in there a remix of the Erasure song and then like other songs it wasn't just the Erasure song
251716	266657	I see, I see, now that makes a lot of sense is that you would more songs and more things so that's great, so awesome and the break man in our chat the whole soundtrack really should just be Erasure songs I
267217	268157	I do agree.
269098	269578	I don't remember.
269678	270778	I played that once.
270798	276800	I don't remember what the other bands were, but I'm sure there's just as lovely songs.
276820	277841	But I do love Erasure.
278341	282582	It's a great catalog, especially when they covered ABBA songs.
283902	290285	I wanted to go, because I was going to read a comment from TheBreakMan over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, again, where we tape live on Sunday nights.
290645	294866	TheBreakMan says, this is only the second Pride month I will actually be celebrating the
295166	296767	The Closet is a terrible place.
296927	299829	I'm trying to figure out what I want to wear to the big festival.
299889	300550	Well, you know what?
300630	302211	Then an extra special break, man.
302251	303371	Happy Pride to you.
303892	307394	You know, I know there's a lot of people out there that go, why do we need a Pride month?
307454	308615	Win straight Pride.
308715	309675	You guys have heard it all.
310296	310416	And...
310996	313918	The fact that you even have to ask that question is why we need a Pride Month.
314058	329508	And just the fact that you are free to be yourself now and you are yourself without apology and the true to what you know you are and living out and loud and proud, that is what it's all about.
329608	332030	And so congratulations to you and all that.
332250	333351	Oh, PodCulture, I love that.
333411	337414	I get some fun looks from neighbors since my ally flag is up outside.
337454	338935	Well, good job, PodCulture.
338955	340476	You are also free to call yourself ally.
341617	342358	So, love that.
343119	347584	And DarkSakura, for Pride Month, you put some merch in your own shop for your ace fam, right?
348905	349226	I did.
349326	351028	I literally just did it today.
351088	352590	It says asexual icon.
354492	357115	And, I mean, people can message me if they want it.
357155	359457	I'm not going to put it, like, yeah.
360178	360699	I'm proud of it.
361055	361976	Yeah, no, it's awesome.
362416	364818	The Breakman says, the closet is a lonely place.
364938	367059	I don't want kids to go through what I went through.
377186	377746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
397751	410517	But because the world is small, I actually have, and I don't want to call anybody out or anything, so I'm not going to name specific names, but I have a friend of a friend who actually used to listen to this show back in the day.
411118	413719	And we are fortunate enough that we've been on the air.
414179	415340	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
431235	433116	The patterns of people's lives change.
433496	438499	The things you have space for to listen to and do throughout the week, that changes.
438539	439059	So all good.
439480	443522	So this is a former listener of the show that used to listen years ago when we were first starting.
443542	448705	Around the time, you might remember, through the first couple years we did this show, I wasn't exactly out on the show.
448805	452807	I mean, it wasn't really a secret, but I wasn't out and proud.
453427	459491	And when I did that, I found that there were people that were listening to this show that would actually email me
460511	464336	and say, hey, and this is honestly one of the biggest compliments I could possibly receive.
464816	477590	Like, hey, hearing you kind of helped me accept who I am because I found out that gay guys aren't just in one type of stereotype, like a Will and I almost said Will and Grace, but Grace wasn't there.
477850	478851	Wasn't the LGBT one.
479411	480692	Will and Jack on TV.
480912	483193	It wasn't one particular archetype that we had in the 90s.
483533	484794	You were a gay nerd.
485334	486035	And I was allowed to see that.
486055	489516	That's always very humbling and is always big for me as well.
489917	495360	So what I'm getting to is that this was one of those individuals that actually had sent an email like that to me some time ago.
495400	500823	And it was really lovely to make that connection in person and really feel like...
501946	503106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
527535	528896	On that note, happy Pride Month.
529236	551709	And to all of you, whether you're celebrating as an ally or you're celebrating because you're newly kicking down the closet door or you've been working it outside the closet loud and proud for years and years, I hope you have a fantastic month and are able to find the love in the community and not just the Rainbow Corporation sponsorships.
552449	556815	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
567270	569811	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
594385	595706	This is the Naughty 3 week.
596846	599827	And maybe I want to spell that N-A-U-G-H-T-Y.
599947	600147	Naughty 3.
600187	601947	I was going to say that totally fits.
602047	603568	Yeah, it kind of went Naughty 3.
603668	604768	You got canceled.
604788	605488	You've been naughty.
605968	608929	So this is Naughty 3 week coming up on the horizon.
608969	611490	So of course you have a lot of companies that are saving their news for this week.
611930	615671	So we're kind of – and there were some big things that happened last week while we were out.
615711	617092	So just kind of a heads up.
617112	617852	We're going to cover –
618372	619733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
635841	638583	This is something, you know, decades in the making.
638903	640504	Yeah, yeah, this is wild to me.
641024	653330	All it takes is being put under the poor leadership of certain individuals and then all of a sudden it becomes an affordable fire sale as far as acquisition goes.
654411	659294	But yeah, so Atari acquired Intellivision.
660086	679906	Which, not surprising, Intellivision is a shell of what it used to be in the first place And, I mean, I'm surprised that they haven't gone under But yeah, Atari announced that they had acquired the brand So I'm assuming that we're going to see some, you know, collections of some of those games coming back again I...
684233	684674	don't know.
684734	694641	They said the Amico will remain with its parent company currently Intellivision Entertainment but both the company and the hardware will be renamed to remove the Intellivision branding.
695321	700345	So they've sold off the license for Intellivision or I guess the actual thing but now the Amico is going to be
702689	703510	Just cancel it.
703550	705372	I mean, it's just, it's not coming.
705632	707454	Like, it really isn't at this point.
708755	716242	So, and Bobby says this in chat, and yes, you know, to be clear, Bobby says, Atari only acquired the brand in some of the games.
716502	717723	They didn't acquire the company.
718744	723689	I get that, but I'm still okay, and I realize there's technicalities here.
723809	727172	I'm still okay with us saying Atari basically buys Intellivision because you know what?
727192	728113	Atari bought their soul.
728593	731015	That's the brand and all that.
731135	733457	That's the soul of Intellivision right there.
733557	734779	I mean, Intellivision-
735459	759070	had to sell what was left and yes Intellivision as a company still exists because that's what's going to ultimately make the Amico using Atari's check to I guess make the Amico happen at this point I don't know I still feel like maybe the next shirt that DarkSakura can put in her store is Tommy Tallarico owes me a hundred bucks because I don't feel like we're ever going to see the actual Amico but
760030	760992	I can make that happen.
761993	766439	What is it going to even have at this point if they don't have the Intellivision license anymore?
766539	768381	What's going to even be on that console?
768401	772046	Who's going to develop for a console that's been supposedly coming out since 2018?
774730	801476	and here's the thing and I want to be very very clear too is that I do because I don't want to like shit on Tommy Tallarico and he's he is he has removed himself from the gaming industry at this point to focus on family which is fine so I don't want to keep making him the main character at this point and I do want to stay I believe he had good intentions now good intentions isn't worth a dime but I believe he had good intentions but was very foolish and
801796	821497	and a little bit eccentric and a bit naive in some of the deals that were made to get here but I don't think Tommy Tallarico went into this you know as much as I joke about that t-shirt I don't think Tommy went into this wanting to steal money from people I think he really did have a vision he just was foolish in how he thought he could get there and now we're in this situation
822924	831187	Yeah, it was a lot of mismanagement that was going on that I think led to the failure of the Amico and a lot of lying.
831207	851093	Because honestly, sure, you can have good intentions, but when you start misrepresenting how far along you are in production to essentially fraud your investors so that you get more investment money, I'm sorry, I don't feel all that bad for them.
854011	874923	um but yeah it's so they're gonna have the rights to essentially uh to 200 games for the Intellivision uh they're going to be able to use the Intellivision name the as far as the Amica goes they're going to still have the ability to uh remaster or remake Intellivision games but
874963	885732	which I believe they had already sold the rights to Astro Smash and Shark Shark because that kind of had to be in there too is that other people own those IPs now or at least moving forward.
885852	894839	It gets a little spaghetti for me but I believe they can release the classic ones but the rights to do new ones are with these new companies now.
895780	903687	So I'd be curious to see what they're going to do with this but I'm sure whatever they do with it is better than whatever Tommy and friends were going to be doing with
904890	906031	The IP in the first place.
923712	925195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
937836	938436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
965785	969408	But still, I mean, those were the two big ones, you know.
970168	971489	My Coleco's kind of up there, too.
971609	980556	But, you know, those were the big, big ones where I think, you know, it feels like that, I think, to gamers of a certain age, where it's like, wow, this is like Nintendo buying Sega.
980716	988821	Or, okay, Nintendo buying the rights to Sonic the Hedgehog so that Sega can make a new, you know...
990222	1007295	Nomad or whatever like this is I mean it's funny though because like actually at a time when Sega was kind of doing poorly you know they're kind of on a rebound now but before like
1008120	1019253	We kind of thought that that might happen because there is this big craze to like acquire a bunch of companies and you had Xbox, of course, making their Bethesda purchases and all those other smaller studios.
1020635	1027163	You had Sony acquiring Bungie and we're like, you know,
1028476	1030418	Man, is Sega going to get bought up next?
1030458	1041867	Because they were kind of in a tight spot where like, well, you know, the most logical person to do that or company would probably be Nintendo because they've been publishing a lot of games on the Nintendo platforms.
1042248	1043609	That never happened, but like
1044009	1046571	It's certainly what seemed plausible at one point.
1046851	1047291	And who knows?
1047331	1048492	Who knows what the future's going to hold?
1048532	1054055	But I think right now, though, they're in a much better spot, at least, as far as stuff coming out.
1054075	1055957	They've got popular IPs.
1056117	1059259	They've got a popular movie franchise now and TV franchise.
1059359	1061140	I think they're sitting pretty good.
1063627	1075919	I want to say too with this Intellivision and Atari thing, as much as we're poking fun and having these little jokes and things, I actually think overall this is a great thing.
1076019	1080383	As much as we don't always love the news of big companies buying other big companies, let's be real.
1080903	1083566	Neither Atari or Intellivision are big companies anymore.
1083647	1085609	They're not what they were in the 80s.
1085629	1086650	They've scaled back a lot.
1087411	1090815	Atari's been slowly building its portfolio through these acquisitions.
1091336	1099445	And I think as far as gaming preservation goes, Atari has been really leaning into that and I'm hoping that they can actually carry...
1100486	1111974	The Intellivision licenses that they've acquired into something really cool for gaming history and that foundation that I don't think the Amico was going to be able to do.
1112414	1119979	I think the Amico was trying to rest on an IP that was really losing... I'm sorry, a variety of IPs that was really losing its...
1122694	1123975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1146753	1165132	but I think as far as game preservation and educating the children about the archives which is something that Atari can do very well through Digital Eclipse and through Atari Age and some of the things they bought online I am actually really excited for what Intellivision
1166133	1169535	libraries can look like now moving forward.
1169575	1175559	You know, we joke a lot on this show about Atari getting you to buy Yars Revenge for the thousandth time.
1176199	1186365	I actually really look forward to what they can do with that with the Intellivision stuff because people don't know Astro Smash and Shark Shark and a lot of the Intellivision IPs anymore.
1186785	1187726	Yeah, sure, we do.
1187886	1192128	You know, some of us that have been gaming nerds for years and years, most people don't.
1192548	1193069	But this
1193769	1194309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1222745	1223705	I do and I don't agree.
1224045	1224826	I do and I don't agree.
1225386	1235090	I think when you talk about people of a certain age, it's the people that have the money to spend on stupid shit like mock arcade cabinets for their home.
1235630	1241072	And for those on the podcast, I'm pointing at one of the arcade cabinets behind me here that you see on my camera.
1242212	1243713	The people that want to...
1244753	1258665	and visit retro gaming are people of a certain age that are now, you know, oftentimes the parents and hell, even grandparents, you know, in this day and age, depending on how old they were when this stuff came out of children that they might want to sit there and play games with.
1260086	1262268	And so I think there's a lot of value in that for sure.
1263843	1289429	but yeah I would hope to hell that there is an Intellivision 50 just like there was an Atari 50 I mean obviously it wouldn't be called that but I would love to see a rock solid Intellivision collection or a few come out of this you know Digital Eclipse has that Gold Master series which is really cool I hope they've already started work on something related to Intellivision because I think it could be fascinating so we'll see what comes of it that could be cool alright
1290336	1292558	From classic games to modern games.
1292798	1300345	So let's also here at the top of the show talk about one of the big headlines from the last seven days, which is Sony's kind of state of play.
1300365	1302247	Surprise, not E3.
1302707	1304028	Because I was assuming.
1304048	1304729	It's not a surprise.
1304829	1307071	Well, I was assuming they were going to wait until August at this point.
1307251	1310514	And when I say surprise, I mean they announced it at 24 hours notice.
1310534	1312075	They tried to do the Nintendo thing, right?
1312115	1314337	So it's like, oh, okay, we're getting a Sony state of play.
1314397	1315058	Cool, here we go.
1315498	1317120	So what happened at Sony's state of play?
1318312	1320994	They showed off a lot of games and it was alright.
1321274	1323416	There wasn't anything super exciting, I feel.
1323796	1325357	There was some stuff that was pretty cool looking.
1325437	1327378	So let's start off.
1327578	1334843	One of the big things that they showed off was Concord, which is kind of this online FPS...
1337147	1340809	It kind of looks a little bit like an Overwatch-type game.
1340909	1346391	I think it's 5v5, if I remember, unless I'm getting my games confused here.
1346511	1350933	I think that was Concord.
1352934	1355576	But yeah, it looked very Overwatch-y.
1356256	1357276	A hero-based shooter, FPS...
1360120	1360540	I don't know.
1360700	1361160	We'll see.
1361421	1362861	I mean, it's supposed to be coming out in August.
1362941	1368144	Everybody's trying to stick an arrow into the knee of Blizzard because they see that Overwatch is weak right now.
1368264	1371725	And I know it's interesting because I know people say, well, Overwatch is hot.
1371765	1374386	So people are making, I'm like, Overwatch has been out for like 10 years.
1374947	1375747	Where was Overwatch 1?
1378108	1379449	I feel like it's been a while.
1379509	1381970	Overwatch 1's been out a while.
1382170	1383831	Overwatch 2's been out for like, what, two years?
1383911	1384791	Here's the difference.
1385031	1388513	Overwatch 2 has a weak point.
1389747	1400728	and that is that it's not Overwatch 1 and that is been rubbing a lot of people the wrong way including my husband is one of them he used to play Overwatch 1 a lot he doesn't care for 2 at all um
1402938	1404299	I've played a little bit of Overwatch too.
1404879	1411142	It's one of those things that I don't play it by myself, but if my friend asks me to hop on and play some games together, sure, I'll play it.
1411222	1413504	It's one of those things where I only play it because I have friends that play it.
1414144	1419447	But otherwise, I was one of those people that was extremely disappointed that they teased a PvE mode that never happened.
1419847	1422128	That would have been something that could have gotten me more interested in it.
1422668	1429952	But now, yeah, it feels like everyone's making some type of Overwatch between this, between the Marvel game.
1430372	1430993	So it's like...
1431853	1432313	Spider-Man Skin
1454892	1478404	whoopity shit you know like who cares um and then what else uh new Until Dawn that's kind of exciting so um I don't think I think it looks like I don't know if it's like just a new game being called the same thing or if it's a remake of the original since I never really played the original but uh coming to the PlayStation 5 and PC um looks pretty cool
1479446	1504138	and then what else so kind of going back here let's see we had announcements more PC announcements God of War Ragnarok coming to PC on September 19th we have some stuff for PlayStation VR 2 so Alien Rogue Incursion which kind of looks awesome we also had Skydance Behemoth
1509338	1512181	I don't remember what that game was.
1512221	1513462	I don't know if it's been shown off before.
1513502	1514483	But it looked cool.
1514803	1515824	FPS sword fighting.
1516084	1517765	So it looks cool.
1518046	1525812	And then speaking of sword fighting, at least the title I recognize, we had... What was it?
1526153	1527494	Dynasty Warriors Origins.
1527854	1530036	Man, talk about that game coming a long way.
1530076	1531918	I remember when they looked super cheap.
1532458	1533299	But now it's...
1535061	1560517	really polished looking so hopefully that's going to be as polished or better polished than some of the other Dynasty Warrior games that have come out in the past because they kind of cut a little bit of the corners there but it looks cool uh what else uh Infinity Nikki so it's a game that is like um anime looking settings cat cannons who doesn't like shooting cats out of cannons they don't get hurt so
1561391	1561751	That's good.
1562572	1564052	Ballad of Antara.
1565293	1567094	And lots of... It was funny.
1567154	1571296	There's a lot of games that they were showing off that seemed very Souls-like.
1571777	1575078	So I wonder if that's going to be something that we're going to be seeing a lot more on PlayStation.
1575098	1578740	I'm so tired of the Souls-like already, and I'm sure a lot of us are.
1578961	1579221	Like...
1580080	1600028	but I get they sell well that's a me personally statement but that hasn't stopped a lot of them from doing very well I need my souls like to have a Bobby Blackwolf mode that's all we had Path of Exile 2 coming to Playstation 5 this year as well that's pretty cool for the record I like Path of Exile
1600968	1604953	It's going to be late 2024 is when that's coming to PlayStation 5.
1605033	1608558	We got some more footage of Silent Hill 2.
1609138	1615546	And of course, there was also that separate Silent Hill transmission that they showed off even more stuff for that.
1615666	1616728	That's coming October 8th.
1617168	1618129	I'll check that out.
1618189	1625620	A lot of people are kind of commenting on some of the way the character models look now is a little bit different for some of the characters.
1626221	1626501	I don't know.
1627502	1628424	I'm willing to give it a shot.
1629285	1631067	I thought the trailer was interesting.
1631448	1631468	I...
1632629	1636811	The voice acting is obviously all new because all the character models are new and all that.
1637011	1642574	I don't think it's going to go the way of the Silent Hill HD collection, especially what was in that trailer.
1643535	1648717	I'm kind of looking at it as like it is just a new retelling of this story.
1648777	1649357	It's kind of like...
1650478	1673853	you know you go to see Mamma Mia on Broadway and then you go to see Mamma Mia at your local community theater and it's going to be two different tellings of the same story right it's it's going to be it's going to be interesting the Silent Hill 2 uh redo so um we'll see we'll see I'm into it though I want to play it yeah um we got a trailer for Where Wind Meets or Where Winds Meet it very um
1675552	1679436	It gave me Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon vibes.
1681497	1682598	Lots of martial arts.
1683920	1692928	Obviously, being this kind of a CG trailer with very little gameplay in there, it's hard to tell what this game's actually going to look like, but it looks cool.
1694689	1696651	Monster Hunter Wild's got another trailer.
1698012	1698453	Looks cool.
1699261	1700221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1717600	1746643	and then what's kind of cute and we'll have to see what ends up happening at this because the other games have been free Astro Bot has its own game now so Astro is the little cute robot kind of mascot for the PlayStation that's been around since like PlayStation 3 and I know like when my kids were little played a ton of some of Astro's playroom stuff but now it's like now you're charging for a game so maybe I mean it looks kind of neat but it's certainly you know
1747614	1756279	Yeah, it's certainly a very Sony-focused game, and, you know, it looks like they're kind of... They got a lot of cool...
1758308	1787347	you know tie-ins with some of the different Sony properties and it looks fun yeah I feel like Astro Bot was the thing it got my attention for sure because I wasn't able to watch this live because I had you know commitments in my day job so I had to kind of get the play-by-play after that fact and this was the thing that made me go oh interesting that's pretty cool that they're actually doing that and it seemed to be the thing that was getting a lot of positive buzz on social media at least in my circles as well it seemed to be the thing that people were most positively responding to as well and
1788588	1794252	And what's interesting, SSJ100 Matt in our chat says, Sackboy died for Astro Bot to live.
1795013	1802699	Kind of, because I feel like part of the reason why people are really responding positively to this is that Sony kind of needs something cute.
1803479	1803679	Yeah.
1803699	1803879	Yeah.
1828032	1854924	but I feel like more people were talking about Astro Bot maybe because it was free but more people seemed to be into what Astro Bot was putting out there than Sackboy so now Astro Bot, kind of like you pointed out is a $70 premium title, assumably so we'll see how it performs but I think Sony needs something like this in their back pocket because yes, they have a lot of great first party license Horizon
1855484	1873407	God of War, Last of Us but they don't have a lot of cutesy things that get the family eye like Nintendo does let's be real so I think this is something that's very important for them to have because yes those family friendly games are important when you're trying to convince you know
1874648	1882451	A dad or a mom who plays games, you know, primarily on the console, like, oh, I could get one of these because then my kid could play this one too.
1882972	1884812	And now it's, you know, something for the whole family.
1885152	1889534	You know, I think you need games like this in order to sell more consoles like the PlayStation 5 needs to do.
1891255	1893196	Was Astro Bot a PlayStation 5 exclusive?
1894485	1894985	I think so.
1895206	1896006	At least right now.
1896046	1900791	Yeah, and actually if it does the controller shit the free one did, it'll have to be.
1901231	1912201	That'll be key as well because that ties into what came up on the show two weeks ago before we took a break was that there isn't a lot of compelling PlayStation 5 exclusive stuff.
1912721	1912861	So...
1913802	1927046	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out and reminds us sadly that's right, Medium Molecule is now gone because Dreams unfortunately didn't make, I mean it was a fine product but the sales have to be there and unfortunately they weren't.
1927906	1934448	So Medium Molecule is now not there anymore so they couldn't really get them to make a new LittleBigPlanet game even if they wanted to.
1935809	1939732	Yeah, and Astro Bot leans into the PlayStation fan service and that's why people liked it.
1940192	1942934	And I think that's why people like a lot of Nintendo stuff too.
1943014	1944896	I think that's a really good page.
1944996	1955424	I mean, I'm not saying they copied it from Nintendo, but I think when you look at some of the things that Nintendo does well, it's leaning into a lot of the retro type of stuff and the history and the, you know, like...
1956044	1959806	I mean, I would still, like, funny enough, I would totally dig another PlayStation All-Stars game.
1978892	1997153	I think a lot of people would I thought that was an interesting concept with like mixing like especially the stages like kind of like combining two different properties that didn't really fit together like together I thought was pretty cool but yeah we'll see great
1998533	2001395	All right, well, there's your state of play from Sony.
2002055	2008438	I would say, though, overall, like, again, it's weird having to look through it through a different lens.
2008539	2017904	Because if this was two years ago, and this was an E3 type of presentation, I would have been like, yikes, that was not enough.
2019004	2022186	Yeah, Astro Bot looks good, but otherwise that was not it, Sony.
2022326	2032312	But that's not exactly fair to use that same lens now because the game has changed with just where the industry is at now versus where the industry was at before the pandemic.
2032752	2044538	So I fully expect that Sony will probably do another one of these that focuses maybe a little more on third parties because I made myself laugh because I was like, oh, I kind of thought they would reveal the PC date for Final Fantasy XVI.
2044838	2045439	And then I was like,
2045939	2046879	Wait a minute, stupid.
2046939	2047640	Wrong company.
2047920	2050841	Like, it's not Sony's thing to announce at that point.
2051161	2052141	That's a Square Enix thing.
2052181	2053662	Maybe we'll get that in the next couple weeks.
2054182	2056083	So, yeah.
2056363	2058384	So, Sony might do something else later on or whatever.
2058464	2059264	But, yeah.
2059344	2066447	I mean, so, you can't really hold it to the same level even against whatever Microsoft's going to do this coming weekend.
2067207	2073249	So... Yeah, I mean, I still think that there's going to be another... Obviously, there's going to be more State of Plays.
2073609	2074650	Because there's still...
2076460	2081125	I think they've still kept it under wraps, but we know that there's going to be a PlayStation 5 redesign coming.
2083047	2086210	And they're going to have something that they're going to want to push with that.
2086230	2088092	Because otherwise, it's like, well, what's the point?
2088772	2093297	So I would imagine around Gamescom is probably when we're going to see that.
2093397	2096100	Because they do usually a pretty big presentation then.
2097220	2098061	3rd Party Reveals
2116027	2117790	It wasn't a main stage, though.
2117850	2123918	They shoved it into kind of a B-roll package while they were... I believe... I'm really having to think back.
2124039	2127163	I think that was the year they were shoving people from room to room.
2127504	2130167	Do you remember that weird year that Sony did in E3?
2130448	2132471	Well, the one that was at Santa Monica?
2132771	2137712	Yeah, I think, no, it was like, they started in the Last of Us room, and then they went to the Spider-Man room.
2137732	2142153	They had, like, musician playing stuff, and I was like, what the hell is this?
2142313	2144533	It was a very high-concept kind of thing.
2145153	2146554	But yeah, they're moving from tent to tent.
2146854	2158516	But there was a reveal trailer that was, I'm trying to see if anyone in chat might remember, there was a reveal trailer that year shoved into one of the B-roll packages while the press was moving from one of the tents that I believe is one of the best reveals of all time.
2158536	2158856	You ready?
2158876	2158956	Yeah.
2159775	2160376	Tetris Effect.
2160916	2162738	It was one of the best E3 trailers of all time.
2163919	2168502	I think the only thing wrong with that reveal was that it was like a B-roll.
2168723	2171185	Because that had every right to be like a big reveal.
2172125	2175528	I think that was a compelling...
2180677	2208310	PlayStation VR game too which Sony needs something like that for PlayStation VR too I mean like even still like with like the Aliens game and some of the other stuff they've shown like there's nothing that is making me like I gotta go I have to have this like there is literally nothing and and I feel that this this it's just never gonna stick yeah it's just gonna end up being like a Vita or something like that where it's like now they have some games on it
2208630	2216734	If Sony does a Gamescom event or an August event or whatever that's a little more third party and they show that Mizuguchi's made a VR2 game, done.
2217114	2217694	I'm buying it.
2219375	2222596	I am a fanboy of his.
2222936	2223997	There's just no way around it.
2224517	2229999	It's weird that I still haven't played Humanity and I'll be the first one to express it.
2230180	2231280	It just came out on Xbox.
2231300	2233821	I don't know if you know, but Humanity just came out on Xbox finally too.
2233841	2234481	I was going to say...
2236766	2245229	C of Eden needs a remake as well as the whole Rez Infinite thing.
2246590	2247910	We need to have that fleshed out.
2248491	2250371	Yeah, where's Rez 2, dammit?
2251031	2254893	Because Area X was very much the Rez 2 proof of concept.
2255578	2256779	I mean, now it's super old.
2256859	2259002	I mean, they wouldn't do it through Unity anymore.
2260964	2262125	How about Child of Eden then?
2262265	2265889	Actually, I'm all for giving Child of Eden a second shot.
2265949	2267231	Let's give Child of Eden a second shot.
2267911	2269513	Yeah, Child of Eden was awesome.
2270014	2273617	I just wish that got a more modern game now.
2273798	2273978	Yeah.
2274944	2277685	Alright, anyway, enough about reminiscing.
2277725	2283167	Let's get to our gaming weeks and reminisce the types of games we've been playing over the last, I suppose, two weeks, if we will.
2283648	2284728	How was your gaming weeks?
2285168	2286429	We'll start with DarkSakura.
2286449	2287169	How was your gaming weeks?
2288610	2291491	It was pretty much the usual.
2292251	2296973	I started Baldur's Gate 3 again, but this time I got it to work on stream because I'm playing it through GeForce.
2298073	2298894	I saw you streaming it.
2299915	2302599	I haven't had a lot of problems running anything through GeForce.
2302679	2303560	It's been really great.
2305402	2306984	And I did play some Avatar.
2307705	2315135	I played, of course, some Dead by Daylight or really enjoying the Chaos Shuffle and gonna enjoy the last bits of it tonight later.
2316296	2316456	And...
2320022	2325224	I'm playing a Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight as we had a Symphony of the Night.
2325985	2331747	I'm playing the Japanese version with an English translation, a pretty literal one at that.
2334167	2343371	I also, just to throw this out there, I was watching a charity tournament for Dead by Daylight hosted by Blabarella and King Bay.
2345195	2349949	raising money for charity and it was like a turn-a-meme
2351013	2351093	Wow.
2376532	2383578	and our mutual friend Nick for also raising a significant amount of money for charity with a marathon last week.
2383838	2388422	Yeah, I was out of town when he was doing all that so I didn't see any of it but he was live for something like 96 hours.
2390407	2391767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2413513	2414995	He's like, this is it.
2415115	2420843	And just put up the plastic duck simulator and let it, quote, babysit us.
2424235	2428599	But of course, you know, Isoco, when it brought in some League of Legends, there was a lot of Dead by Daylight.
2428639	2429320	I played some.
2430922	2431862	I participated a little bit.
2431922	2432623	I had a lot of fun.
2433224	2435045	People would be stinky, but it was still fun.
2437007	2446095	And I just want to say I'm really enjoying seeing people use gaming for good, and we need more of that in this world.
2446616	2450119	Although, I cannot...
2450954	2454159	I barely can do my 12 hour marathons when I do them.
2455374	2457696	I don't know how I made a 24-hour one.
2457736	2460058	I think it was through pure stubbornness and spite.
2461219	2467665	But just good on them for being able to do such a good job.
2468185	2475992	Even in the light of technical issues like Blabarella and Bay had today, they still made a quick switch and made it work.
2476472	2481577	You always have to have a plan B or what to do and it all falls apart.
2482668	2486950	Yeah, congrats to them and again everyone who did everything and to Nick as well.
2488831	2491893	I got to see an epic Twins game by Nick tonight, by the way.
2493354	2494294	It was really good.
2494935	2496496	But I'll leave that for later.
2496636	2497856	Is Vecna out on Tuesday?
2499017	2500258	Yeah, Tuesday.
2500698	2503640	They were doing some giveaways during the tournament as well.
2503680	2504600	I didn't win any of them.
2505140	2507362	But yeah, we're getting the D&D DVD release.
2512054	2514355	or how was it that Blabarello was saying it?
2514835	2516676	The D&D DBD DLC.
2517996	2522038	I think that's going to be a nice kick in the butt for the game because I think it's really adding some new mechanics.
2522118	2523719	I think you're going to be really interesting for people.
2523839	2524979	So I'm looking forward to that.
2525019	2529101	And they're fixing all those problems people were having with Vecna being just way too easy.
2529361	2530142	Yeah, yeah.
2530762	2533203	Or more like playing against him being way too easy.
2533483	2533623	Yeah.
2535022	2543046	Anyway, but yeah, that's... Oh, and I started playing that stupid RuPaul's Drag Race Superstar game on my iPhone, and I already hate myself for it.
2545167	2549729	But I also like... I don't know what it is, but I like dress-up games.
2551590	2554651	Hey, look, they're popular to this day for a reason.
2555835	2583187	and now I kind of want to like start like one of those makeover games I'm just like oh my god what's wrong with me now I don't want to do this for myself but I'll do it for virtual people that's that's the 24-hour stream you should do next playing um you know wow dress up I'm a fashion model type of thing on uh Nintendo Switch or something uh well it'll have to all be on my computer so that's fair all right uh well let's go over to Loki how was your gaming weeks
2584393	2587195	Um, well, I didn't play a ton.
2587756	2589597	I think I played a bit more.
2589877	2591418	I'm trying to think because it's been a long time.
2592935	2598400	I'm almost finished with Turbo Kid, so I'm just about done with that now.
2598440	2603945	I'm trying to, like, kind of, not 100% the game, but, like, get close to 100%ing the game.
2605207	2613995	So, basically, I got to a point in there, it's like, okay, once you get past this point, they're going back, so you better finish up anything you need to do.
2614315	2615636	I was like, alright, I hear ya.
2616737	2618719	Um, so I played a little bit of that.
2619340	2626245	I mostly have played Minecraft, so I've been designing my theme park entrance, which is done being designed now.
2626686	2636934	However, I've been helping a server mate dig an extremely large area of our map so that he can make his extremely large base.
2638075	2640798	So, been working on that for like a few days now.
2641798	2644040	Um, caught MCC, uh...
2645261	2659177	MCC Pride 24 so we they just did that tournament yesterday and that was pretty cool what else oh well I think it was actually in the last two weeks we ended up on some tier lists
2659898	2660058	S.T.E.A.R.
2682898	2683739	That's like S tier.
2683779	2686062	Congrats.
2686362	2697095	If anybody hasn't watched some of my fellow Channel 64 members, and you like Minecraft, maybe go check them out because we all do things a little bit differently, but we all do it really well.
2698317	2699038	Go check those out.
2700950	2702571	Alright, well congrats on that.
2703211	2704591	It's nice when someone notices you.
2704892	2710934	Even if it's somebody that's also working their way up as a content creator.
2710974	2712214	It's nice to be noticed, that's for sure.
2713335	2714295	My gaming weeks.
2714415	2719197	Honestly, when it comes to the games I've been playing, I've been playing a lot of games, but it's games I've talked about on the show before.
2719357	2721718	I'm still really into the Warcraft Pandaria Remix.
2722238	2726400	I love how fucking stupid overpowered your characters get.
2726580	2728661	I'm playing Heroic Dungeons where I basically...
2729401	2731663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2748993	2749594	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2767794	2794737	but in an environment that you're a little more familiar with if you left WoW during Mists of Pandaria like I did so I think it's brilliant what Blizzard did with this and I hope they continue it to be honest for other expansions in the future just not be afraid to do other silly modes like this I didn't care for the last mode they did a lot the Plunderstorm which was their Fortnite type mode but I love that it happened it was something different and something really unique I at least tried it if nothing else um
2795558	2810241	of course I'm still playing Final Fantasy XIV because I always do and that expansion is only like three weeks away I even played a little bit of Dead by Daylight DarkSakura be proud of me I played just a little bit because yeah I like the chaos shuffle thing too they need to do that more often when we have downtime
2811402	2811903	You know what?
2812163	2818966	You know, I have to say, I got to learn perks that I never knew existed.
2819226	2819446	Yeah.
2819946	2824589	Oh, I mean, I knew they existed, but I never really gave the time of day.
2824649	2824849	Yes.
2825869	2826610	So I'm...
2827770	2828991	I had a lot of fun with it.
2829031	2829712	A lot of fun.
2829772	2835196	Well, the number one perk, pun intended, about Chaos Shuffle is that people can't bring sweaty builds.
2835556	2839479	It forces people to play the game with whatever cards they're dealt.
2839499	2841840	And I think that's really, really neat.
2841920	2847584	So I think they should bring this back regularly when there's not other events or other things going on.
2847604	2851867	Like, I understand we got a new killer on Tuesday and I think the 8th anniversary event's around the corner.
2852288	2853548	So they're probably not... On the 13th.
2854429	2855509	Oh wow, that's so soon.
2855929	2857370	So yeah, it'll be good.
2857690	2859510	All right, but here's what I actually really want to talk about.
2859590	2865651	So I mentioned I was in Chicago last weekend and I was mostly doing Ingress.
2865691	2867192	That was a lot of fun and all that.
2867552	2869752	But this weekend I traveled as well.
2869792	2870832	I didn't go quite as far.
2871232	2875273	I went to San Francisco, which is kind of a day trip, although we made it an overnight trip.
2876153	2879154	I went with Alan and one of our mutual or one of our friends.
2879594	2880635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2897372	2900334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2922469	2923910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2947017	2950160	and I see in particular the San Francisco Symphony doing this a lot.
2950561	2951822	They're doing the Final Fantasy.
2952082	2959891	They were advertising a Coco, the movie from Disney, a Coco night where they were going to play that live and I saw them do it with other big movies.
2960231	2962013	I think John Legend is coming there to do it.
2962213	2967239	So they're doing more contemporary stuff with the symphony to get...
2967659	2969662	and more diverse age groups interested in it.
2969702	2971966	And Final Fantasy is a huge draw.
2972006	2973468	That place was very full.
2974069	2981782	I don't think it was sold out, but the orchestra level stuff was definitely full and, you know, only a few seats visible in the first and second balcony.
2983211	2989734	So they play, you know, a variety of songs and obviously they have 16 games to go through.
2989894	2995817	And so you hear some songs from some, not from others, but you sort of go and think, okay, I'm going to hear this song, this song.
2995837	2995957	Yeah.
2996437	2999318	But last night they were pulling out these songs.
2999378	3002240	I was like, oh, that's a deep cut.
3002320	3002740	Cool.
3003180	3006902	So like we got to hear, I didn't even know this is the rotation.
3006922	3010804	We got to hear the Phantom Forest and the Velt from Final Fantasy VI.
3012149	3013390	as a live symphony doing that.
3014091	3017294	And that's just, I just, you know, those are great songs.
3017654	3021297	I just wouldn't have thought like, oh, I can only pick, you know, 15 songs to do.
3021317	3023599	I would not think that those are the ones they pick.
3023959	3027222	They did Jesse's theme from Final Fantasy VII Remake.
3027802	3031525	Which, you know, again, of all the songs to do from that, I was really pleasantly surprised they did that.
3032485	3036828	And they said this was the only time that they were going to do it in 2024.
3037829	3041291	They did the opera from Final Fantasy VI with guest singers.
3041912	3045594	It was, like, I will fully admit, I was moved to tears.
3045994	3046435	I cried.
3046675	3048436	It was so powerful.
3048776	3049517	So well done.
3049897	3054500	And I saw them do the opera at More Friends years ago.
3054620	3056422	This was like the second show they ever did.
3057222	3057742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3078570	3080771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3105467	3107990	When, um, what's the guy's name?
3108050	3108851	Oh my God, I can't remember.
3108991	3109192	Art.
3111675	3113317	What's the guy's name that conducts it?
3113377	3114459	Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed.
3114499	3115740	Somebody in chat's got to know this.
3118284	3121348	I'm at a loss for words because I can't remember the guy's name.
3121368	3121568	Artie?
3122309	3122570	Artie?
3124141	3125302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3144537	3148481	He also said, so I guess they're doing a show in Tokyo next week.
3149021	3156208	And he said that at that Tokyo meeting, he's actually meeting with Soken and they are going, thank you, Arnie Roth.
3156349	3156769	Thank you.
3156869	3158190	I was getting the first name, Arnie Roth.
3158210	3158491	Thank you.
3159071	3163916	He was saying that they are going to be adding 16 into the rotation next week.
3163976	3165137	So there were no songs from 16 played.
3166258	3167499	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3184545	3185266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3205740	3209403	The intro to Final Fantasy VIII, Libri Fatali, that song has to be there every time.
3209683	3212044	To Xanarkand, it has to be there every time, and One Winged Angel from VII.
3212324	3218709	I think those are the songs, because now that I'm piecing it together, every time I've seen this show, those are the songs that are there every time.
3219649	3223192	But yeah, they played Saber's Edge from Final Fantasy XIII.
3223332	3226814	They did not do any XIII last time I was there, so I was very pleased they did XIII.
3227314	3229776	Unfortunately, XII got the shaft this time.
3229796	3232758	They didn't play anything from XII, but there's only so much time, right?
3233098	3234539	They did two songs from XIV.
3235800	3262833	both of them newer they did uh Invincible from Shadowbringers and they did um I don't remember the name of the song but it's the end singer battle song uh from I don't want to be spoilery but I told I had to tell my friend is playing through Final Fantasy 14 right now and when it started and I saw the first frame of the video I was like look away look away don't look at this because it opened with a freaking spoiler of the video and I don't think it was like I
3263553	3265135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3286776	3287796	They did do Fifteen.
3288276	3293198	They did the Apocalypse Noctis or something like that, it's called, from Fifteen.
3293418	3295458	Like, the best song on Fifteen's soundtrack, they did.
3295958	3307321	So I was, like, honestly, like, I was all, like, I felt like I, the only songs I heard both times were those songs I just named a minute ago that they said they had to do at every show.
3307801	3312202	I was very, very, yeah, Apocalypse Noctis, that song is fucking incredible live.
3313142	3340780	and I don't use fucking Incredible and Final Fantasy XV in the same sentence often but there's some damn good music in XV and that's one of the songs for sure so anyway I was very happy I completely walked into that going okay I'm here for my friend I'm gonna see this again I like Final Fantasy but you know I've kind of seen this show before or whatever and then by the time it was over I was like we got to see the opera and it was so good so
3342219	3342559	All right.
3343179	3344619	Yeah, I'm with you, Breakman.
3344799	3346660	Final Fantasy XV was half a great game.
3347780	3353181	For a game that was in development for 10 years, it was an unfinished vision, but that's because it was really in development for two years.
3353921	3354321	But anyway.
3355221	3356441	All right, let's move on.
3356481	3357402	Enough about our gaming weeks.
3357442	3360122	Let's get back into some news and what is going on in the industry.
3360922	3365043	Let's get into... I was trying to think, do we have any shows off coming up?
3366003	3366503	I don't think so.
3366583	3368984	I'll be gone for a weekend in July, but that's a ways off.
3369024	3369844	It's like the end of July.
3372156	3376417	I will also be gone in one of the weekends in July.
3376577	3377558	Oh, I hope it's the same weekend.
3377618	3378558	Is it Comic-Con weekend?
3379538	3380839	July 21st, I think it is?
3381979	3383840	It might be, yes.
3384340	3387661	So I'm not going to Comic-Con, but I am going to San Diego that weekend.
3387921	3391642	So it turns out we're both, I guess, not going to be here.
3391823	3392723	So it works out.
3393564	3395567	I'm also going to the coast, just not San Diego.
3395767	3396588	No, there you go.
3396628	3401634	I don't have any San Diego plans until TwitchCon and I still need people to stay with.
3403536	3407221	I think it's so funny that you and Loki are going, are you still going to TwitchCon this year, Loki?
3407982	3410605	Yeah, I already got my tickets, my flight's booked, everything's ready to go.
3411124	3415747	We could have had all of us go, but nope, I'm the one that's ruining that.
3415767	3417248	We're taking this year off of TwitchCon.
3417788	3421551	I will be in Seattle that same weekend, unfortunately, so bummer.
3421611	3424212	But I hope you all have a great time.
3424333	3426894	Loki, you haven't been before, so it's going to be all new for you.
3426934	3431897	DarkSakura, she's a vet by now, but Loki, I'm excited to hear your experiences.
3432158	3438902	And DarkSakura will, of course, get to meet all the people I like as well there, so I'm excited to hear about how that goes.
3439282	3441003	Any friends need a roommate for the trip?
3441063	3441503	Let me know.
3442023	3442283	Awesome.
3442743	3452367	I technically have a... because my wife's not going, so I technically have a hotel room booked for two, but yeah.
3453808	3454268	Alright.
3455148	3457209	Jesus Christ, Bobby Blackwolf might be there too.
3459412	3464034	It's almost humorous that I'm not going at this point, but oh well, I guess it is what it is.
3464114	3465934	All right, let's get into some other news.
3466335	3468255	I'll be at DragonCon, though, again this year.
3468275	3472116	Y'all, I'm really excited for DragonCon this year.
3472897	3474777	And stay tuned until August.
3475337	3477738	We can tell you all about DragonCon this year.
3477858	3481379	But I'm just saying, I'm really, really excited.
3482020	3482460	All right, Loki.
3483519	3486822	Alright, so this is something we've talked about before.
3486982	3490686	It was leaked before, but now it's been confirmed and it's coming out.
3490826	3495150	So, the very first Legend of Zelda LEGO set.
3495530	3498633	It's the Legend of Zelda The Great Deku Tree.
3499113	3502937	It's a two-in-one set, so not only do you get to make the, um...
3504133	3510758	The brand new version, which was in Breath of the Wild, but you also get the Ocarina of Time version as well.
3510919	3516503	It is 2,500 pieces and $300 because it's Lego and that's how they roll.
3517063	3519405	Coming out September 1st of this year.
3520366	3522147	It is damn expensive.
3522988	3525250	Yeah, that's a lot of Legos to step on.
3526131	3527272	It's a cool looking set though.
3527532	3527752	Yeah.
3528413	3529453	I just have no place to put it.
3530794	3531075	Maybe.
3531715	3532035	I don't know.
3532316	3532616	We'll see.
3534148	3536789	Bobby Blackwell points out, to be fair, you can't have both of them.
3536849	3538609	It's the same pieces that made either one.
3538629	3539230	You have to buy two.
3540130	3541830	Yeah, that's what they do.
3542110	3543551	It's the other Pokemon strategy.
3543571	3545612	Exactly.
3545652	3546312	You want it all.
3546372	3547892	You gotta buy more than one.
3548732	3550733	Well, okay, Loki, you are the Lego fan.
3550773	3552093	Gotta buy them all.
3552654	3553254	Legomon.
3555034	3558115	Loki, you are kind of the Lego aficionado of the group.
3558295	3560236	Is this something you're probably going to end up buying anyway?
3561676	3563457	Um... Hmm...
3564780	3565160	I don't know.
3565180	3569103	It'd have to drop down in price and I'd buy it for my son because he's a big Zelda fan.
3569583	3570143	Oh, that's cool.
3570664	3571904	That's something you guys can do together.
3571924	3574906	He's also a Lego fan, so he'd like both.
3575126	3575526	That's great.
3576667	3580369	It's like we've been looking for the Animal Crossing sets, but they don't have them at Target right now.
3580409	3584772	They're all in the Lego store, so I just haven't bothered to get one yet.
3586508	3595655	All right, well, let's talk about... This is a very interesting sort of headline because Sony had to pull an interview with a Sony studio interview.
3596356	3598398	Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog.
3599278	3602241	Sony pulled an interview that was posted.
3603682	3604623	And, you know, it's...
3606212	3608594	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3622893	3638277	So in this interview, Neil Druckmann said that AI could create nuanced dialogues and characters and that there was a new game that Naughty Dog was developing, but not officially announced, could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.
3638758	3642019	And, you know, obviously people have their thoughts on AI right now.
3642079	3650101	And I think, you know, when I think of a narrative driven studio like Naughty Dog and some of the amazing things they've done for AI or not for AI, but
3650501	3652123	Some of the amazing things they've done for gaming.
3652564	3660755	I don't like to hear that they're getting close to AI in a story or writing, especially create nuanced dialogues and characters.
3660935	3661996	I don't like to hear that at all.
3662637	3666162	I understand AI as a tool that is going to be inevitable for
3666522	3667543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3684738	3685498	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3714554	3719319	So it was this dialogue that he said, you know, something that AI generated because, you know, it's the writing and everything.
3734878	3742125	Well, so he says, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost, and here's the full rambling text.
3742585	3749812	And then some other folks, namely the journalist Stephen Toledo, went onto Twitter and said, hey, here's a comparison.
3750173	3751834	Here's the stuff that's in bold.
3752875	3757116	That was not that like they cut out and like was not even in the original thing.
3757816	3762998	And they cut this line not because games need to be movies or because they need to be TV shows.
3763358	3770660	And that's a little bit of, you know, God, you look at the last section of the interview and it's completely like they added stuff into it.
3771300	3775184	Well, Sony removed the interview from the site and then they left.
3775524	3794763	So what they did, they deleted the interview, but they put up a new page that said it had an apology that said in re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values, including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects.
3795564	3802673	So basically all the things that people were upset about were things that he didn't say anyway.
3803995	3805477	And so it just looks stupid.
3806318	3810704	But I would imagine that a lot of these things, and this is very typical...
3811837	3818363	They go through like an internal communications and branding check, probably because this is posted externally.
3818423	3832035	It goes through some sort of marketing check and it goes through all these different types of departments and things that wanted to put in their own, you know, and kind of, yeah, because there's certain things that maybe Sony, whatever, is trying to push right now.
3832075	3833837	So they change things.
3834497	3842982	and I think it's a really fascinating insight because again, he was being very nice, Neil was, because it was a Sony to Sony situation.
3843322	3844023	But you know what?
3844943	3847125	This is fucking happening everywhere.
3848160	3872487	and it's not just company to company this is why a lot of times people get really weird things taken out of context and it kind of sucks so it's it's great that Neil held on to the original interview was able to you know he probably had a recording I'm sure the whole uh thing was recorded and he probably went back to the transcription um but it's just it's just wild so anyway um
3873767	3899185	yeah Bobby Blackwolf in chat says sadly because game developers are now so wary about speaking to the press or the public this is the only way that we can hear from devs yeah well and it's no wonder why they're wary in speaking and now many of you in chat joked AI was probably used to edit the interview I mean maybe we can't prove that but I bet that's happening elsewhere I bet that's happening in the industry somewhere anyway
3901325	3903027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3920191	3926095	Alright, at any rate, IGN has made some purchases and started some layoffs.
3926656	3936283	They've acquired Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, and also GameIndustry.biz.
3937762	3956302	Dicebreaker they're basically it's all under mashable PC mag the one listed that even though it's a part of the gamer network is still privately owned VGC gamer network
3956642	3959125	Thank you for watching!
3976681	3991410	including the GameIndustry.biz Managing Editor, Brendan Sinclair, a veteran of VG247, Stephanie Minnelli-Jackson, and Rock Paper Shotgun Deputy Editor, Alice Bell.
3994072	3994332	Yeah.
3995673	3996433	More bullshit.
3997474	3998054	Don't like it.
3998772	3999413	I don't like it at all.
3999433	3999933	I don't like any of it.
4000273	4012803	I don't like it either, but I'm so worried about the journalism future because so many boardrooms feel that AI is going to be able to do a journalist job and it is going to backfire spectacularly.
4014284	4016285	And that's when we collect the money.
4017066	4019808	Right?
4021649	4025272	I will say this, that the moment I would...
4026484	4039476	if I were a company I mean with as much as they want to save money with AI if they really want to cover their asses they're going to avoid having AI do that kind of legwork because it can't imitate human judgment and
4042173	4056896	It doesn't have that... I mean, and this is the thing, too, is that when we're going into... There are going to be a lot more cases like what happened with Sony, even though there allegedly isn't any AI involved in that one.
4057676	4062117	We're going to start seeing more companies dragged over this.
4062477	4067378	And they act like it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
4068119	4069599	But I'd like to see...
4070959	4082075	I would like to see journalistic integrity held to a higher standard instead of just giving us recycled sensationalism.
4082396	4086882	Because at that point, if they're going to start using AI for that, they may as well start calling it a tabloid.
4087622	4091504	Well, they're just going to use AI for the guides because that's what they're pushing now, right?
4091524	4093685	Kotaku says, hey, we make guides now.
4094325	4096026	We're game facts.
4096326	4101228	It's going to backfire because, you know, AI is definitely not in a perfect place yet.
4101268	4103549	And, you know, AI is being shoved down our throats now.
4103629	4105930	Obviously, Facebook has been doing a lot.
4105970	4108371	Like now you go into comments and you see Facebook.
4108671	4113873	Yeah, and it's like you go to Google things and oftentimes you see an AI result first.
4114053	4114534	All the time.
4114814	4115154	Which is...
4115854	4121800	Okay, so you know how to get rid of the AI searches on a Google search, right?
4121900	4123622	Oh no, I hadn't looked how to do that yet.
4123642	4124683	Yeah, I didn't know about that.
4124743	4137857	Yeah, I have a link that I'll put in chat for this that will just do it automatically for you, but it's a little ending that you can add on it that bypasses the AI results and brings like a classic Google search up.
4138357	4139457	I'll find it for you.
4139677	4149999	And let me also point this out is that with AI, and I think a lot of people have lulled because people went into Google and asked something like, can I eat rocks?
4150399	4152920	And the AI comes back and says, yes, rocks are yummy.
4152980	4156961	I don't remember what the exact question was, but because it was pulling it from an Onion article.
4157401	4161902	So AI can't really see that nuance and parody that's out there on the internet, right?
4161922	4167903	And it's almost as if you could flood the internet with misinformation and AI will pick it up.
4169687	4170668	Period, end of sentence.
4170728	4172209	That's the biggest problem with AI right now.
4173110	4176592	Especially in an election year, it's going to be continuing to be the biggest problem with AI.
4176712	4177913	So just look out, everybody.
4178654	4184098	And especially now that image generators now are so sophisticated.
4185379	4196107	Also, what's really important is the fact that... I understand that Google wants to lean into AI a little more because I do think where AI is...
4197373	4198154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4216972	4219953	Appetizers for Party, you know, and looks that stuff up.
4220333	4225194	Now people are going to chat GPT and kind of doing that more specific sort of nuanced thing.
4225794	4237417	So I understand why Google is trying to lean into it a little more because Google sees the AI is about to replace it because that's where, you know, AI is, you know, really there won't be Googling things.
4237477	4240458	It'll be chat GPTing things or whatever it is.
4240538	4242979	So this is a big reason why Google is trying to lean into this.
4243059	4243499	However,
4244608	4247753	It doesn't mean... Again, it's not ready for primetime.
4247793	4248133	Thank you.
4248193	4252179	Everybody in chat is pulling... Questmaster pulls up the put glue in your pizza.
4252460	4255183	Yeah, another nuanced thing, which is what they do in marketing ads.
4256606	4258709	So I'm going to add it in that the...
4259901	4279067	you can add to your search string ampersand U like uniform D like delta and like mic equal sign one four there and it's out there you you can find it but for anyone who has like Google as their home page there's also
4280828	4282209	It's a little bit different.
4282229	4283129	I put it in chat.
4283210	4293396	We can put this up on one of our socials later, but you can do that as your search engine if it lets you put in a custom search engine link and that will load it up as your search page.
4296061	4301905	Anyway, we deviate a little bit from the original headline of IGN buying Eurogamer.
4301945	4311252	But I do think it comes back to these large companies and these large boardrooms that these companies really feel like AI is going to replace journalism.
4311393	4313894	And that is a very sad future we're looking at.
4314835	4315656	Very sad.
4317537	4320980	Honestly enough, I'm about ready to go make my own commune.
4322361	4325862	We need regulation on AI, like now.
4325982	4331804	But the problem is our government is so fucking fractured and split that it's not going to happen.
4332324	4333625	And they're supporting it.
4336866	4342267	They're supporting it now until their party doesn't get in the search results as much as they feel like it.
4342347	4344528	Then all of a sudden it'll be like, we gotta ban them.
4346388	4348309	Honestly, I...
4350720	4351580	I'm just going to leave this here.
4351781	4352441	Term limits.
4353261	4354222	Please, term limits.
4354462	4354882	Of course.
4355162	4367629	And, you know, we need Google AI to be able to, when you type in, is Trump a twice-impeached convicted felon, the results come up and say, yes, he was convicted.
4368209	4373292	So we just need that to come up, and then that party will support that.
4373652	4375373	And on the Democratic side, too.
4375633	4377794	You know, it needs to be accurate as well, you know?
4378335	4378615	Yeah.
4381432	4382773	Anyway, I'm not going to get into it.
4383933	4387894	Anyway, IGN bought companies and laid off people and it sucks.
4388514	4390034	Yes, it sucks.
4391235	4392375	Hopefully less sucky news.
4392655	4393675	A little bit more lighthearted.
4393715	4393975	Loki.
4394875	4398516	Yeah, trying not to get any more felonies on your way to the parking lot.
4399716	4400517	Anyway, 34 felonies in a row.
4404350	4405612	34, yes.
4407755	4411880	So this week was the celebration of Minecraft's 15-year anniversary.
4412842	4419211	And as such, they had a bunch of different announcements that came out regarding Minecraft, none of which were the Minecraft...
4419935	4420535	Thanks for watching!
4440466	4462740	and yeah we don't know what it's going to be about because they just had a really really short trailer and it kind of reminded me of the kind of cinematic trailers that they do for the Minecraft updates right now and to talk about what Jason was saying in the intro about Jack Black voicing Steve no no sir you are incorrect Jack Black is Steve it's a live-action movie
4464813	4465634	Yay!
4466294	4467935	He just embodies Steve.
4468095	4470176	And then Jason Momoa is somebody.
4470637	4471437	He's there too.
4475279	4476680	When's that Minecraft movie coming out?
4476760	4477141	Next year?
4477961	4479782	Next year sometime.
4479822	4480402	I don't know when.
4480923	4481323	Interesting.
4481943	4485005	But they've finished filming, I think, already.
4486366	4487407	Wow, they did that fast.
4488868	4489208	Trash.
4489388	4490709	I mean, I'm sure it's good.
4492659	4495453	I'm sure they'll handle it as well as they've handled their updates.
4498655	4500196	Exactly, it's just like, you know
4531236	4541268	When you tease an update as the wild update and you say, we're going to reimagine all these different biomes and you add one and then do nothing else.
4541608	4542830	Well, that's wild.
4542950	4543811	That's not wild.
4543851	4544672	That's just like, that's awful.
4544692	4546114	That's some wild marketing you did.
4546874	4574202	or now the process is instead of like coming up with a theme and then working towards like this themed update can you imagine like an expansion for Final Fantasy but instead of it like being like this themed expansion with a story and all this stuff it's just like oh whatever crap we have in the development cycle that we just happen to finish and we'll piece it all together and then just try to figure out what involves crap on the table what kind of theme does this fit you know and then that's what we're going to call it I mean
4575282	4578925	To be fair, Diablo 3 sold that as the Necromancer expansion.
4580646	4581706	It's kind of what they're doing.
4581787	4584568	So it's ridiculous, but like, whatever.
4585469	4586029	It's what it is.
4588091	4592114	SSJ100Matt in chat says, we're supposed to get an Among Us animated series trailer this week.
4592294	4595556	Well, I mean, with Naughty 3 Week this week, so it makes a lot of sense.
4595956	4596737	Yeah, I saw that.
4596757	4597657	It looked interesting.
4597938	4599018	I don't know.
4599058	4600039	Hey, you know what?
4600720	4602781	I mean, just look back, like,
4603946	4613436	Yeah, that's true.
4613476	4616679	We've been eating really good when it comes to a lot of video game media lately.
4616859	4618041	And not all of it.
4618261	4624688	Some of it's still pretty crap, but... Well, I mean, you know, for the most part, it's still pretty good.
4624828	4624988	Yeah.
4626407	4649788	um what else what what hasn't been optioned into a Netflix uh series or movie or something like that that needs to be still I heard the Final Fantasy 14 thing isn't happening and that makes me sad yeah I don't think that's not happening but like wasn't there supposed to be a Bioshock series at one time I mean I I know that that was something that was talking they were talking about that Mass Effect they always talk about
4650548	4652290	a movie or a TV show or something.
4652310	4653651	It feels like it never goes anywhere.
4653671	4654352	It gets off the ground.
4654512	4655413	I wish they would.
4655733	4664442	I think they're very scared to commit to one canon in Mass Effect but I think there's ways they could tell the story and let the game be its own thing for sure.
4668201	4687709	Alright, moving on, let's talk about some news that's happening at Twitch Television And that is the removal of the Safety Council Okay, it's a little different than that But the Safety Council was given notice that they will no longer be needed So there is the Safety Advisory Council that was formed in 2020
4689049	4696517	This board was helping Twitch with new policies, developing products to improve safety, protecting interests of marginalized groups.
4696617	4709009	Unfortunately, as Twitch gained a lot of popularity during pandemic lockdowns, that was also the rise of bullshit like hate raids and a lot of the negative shit we think about when we think about Twitch.
4710209	4723833	However, according to CNBC, which reports on a lot of financial updates, Twitch has terminated the members on the council because you have to pull everybody in and tell them that basically their contracts are going to end with a certain amount of notice.
4724213	4730114	So they were brought into a meeting on May 6th and told their contracts end on May 31st and there will be no payment for the second half of 2024.
4730174	4732575	That's ridiculous.
4732715	4736056	Some of the members included a Dr. Samir
4736696	4740562	Hinduja, who is co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, Dr. T.L.
4740602	4750897	Taylor, the co-founder and director of AnyKey, Emma Lonzo, I hope I said that right, I'm sorry if I didn't, the director of the Free Expression Project for the Center of Democracy and Technology.
4751838	4754061	Those are some pretty big heavy hitter names.
4754321	4762510	And with that, it was apparently the members on this board were being paid between $10,000 and $20,000 a year.
4762610	4766494	This was not their full-time gig because I just mentioned they all have these other commitments.
4766534	4771219	This was something they did part of the time, but you can see that that money starts to add up.
4772344	4781273	So Twitch said in an email to those members that going forward, the Safety Advisory Council will primarily be made up of individuals who serve as Twitch ambassadors.
4781874	4787380	Twitch ambassadors are people that positively contribute to the Twitch community from being role models for their community
4787680	4791763	to establishing new content genres to having inspirational stories that empower those around them.
4792624	4802972	There was a statement from Twitch trusted safety communications manager Elizabeth Busby who said the new council members are going to quote, offer fresh, diverse perspectives.
4803452	4811178	We're excited to work with our global Twitch ambassadors, all of whom are active on Twitch, know our safety work first and have a range of experiences to pull from.
4812244	4814986	Of course, there's no word on if those ambassadors will get paid.
4816127	4820671	But you would assume that most of those ambassadors are probably existing Twitch partners and things like that.
4820731	4826415	So maybe the tradeoff will be promotion, front page, all things like that.
4827836	4831759	The Reddit moderator philosophy, I guess.
4831919	4832420	I don't know.
4833400	4836923	I understand that these guys, these were some big names.
4837143	4839966	And so they had to compensate those big names for that.
4841711	4842211	I don't know.
4842312	4854185	I'm concerned, whereas financially I sort of understand like, okay, yeah, that could have been a couple full-time employees there with that cost.
4855887	4860772	I just would hate to see something like hate raids or these type of attacks show up again in the future.
4860832	4861333	It still happened.
4861633	4863154	Yeah, they're still happening.
4863555	4869399	Not as prevalent, but even if it happens to one marginalized streamer, it's shitty and it shouldn't happen at all.
4869559	4874863	So I think that's money that Twitch needs to put into moderation.
4875864	4876664	But anyway.
4877665	4878806	Sorry, they'll have AI do it.
4880647	4889174	Don't joke about that because honestly, there's big truths that I don't want to admit in what you just said.
4892281	4896122	But again, AI doesn't understand nuance.
4897143	4902485	And that is... And when it comes to moderation, it's all about that.
4905346	4905626	Anyway.
4906246	4907467	For example, there is a...
4909728	4910629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4932639	4933139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4957156	4958797	but that's all nuance, right?
4959377	4963618	So I should be able to say that but if, sorry Loki, I'm going to pick on you.
4963658	4967320	Loki would never use that word inappropriately but we'll say evil Loki.
4967680	4976043	If evil Loki were playing Minecraft and was like, this came in and destroyed my build then yeah, he should get a ban for that.
4977163	4978244	But nuance is everything.
4978264	4984686	I picked on one of my VODs because someone, a random person I had picked up playing DVD with dropped it.
4985426	4989569	And I had to go and publish my VOD and give them a very strong talking to.
4989689	4991850	Yeah, yeah.
4991930	4994332	Breakman in chat says, can bi men use that word?
4994432	4995633	I mean, we get called it too.
4995793	4998294	Okay, I'm going to just leave you with the answer.
4998495	4999395	It's complicated.
5000056	5001937	And I think you look at this.
5002477	5006079	I would say generally, yes, you can use that word.
5007500	5011543	That's not a blank check to write it on every sentence that comes out of your mouth.
5014120	5018556	Think about the weight that a word like that carries because you've been called that.
5019670	5020991	DarkSakura
5049235	5058399	Okay, so EA has formed a team to finally deal with some of the Sims 4's bugs and some tech issues.
5061920	5069283	They said that they're going to invest more in the core game experience, including fixing performance and content-related bugs.
5070383	5098514	um their their quote is we know that technical issues with Sims 4 have interrupted your gameplay over time and we recognize that this has caused you much frustration today we can share that we have assembled a team to invest in the core gaming experience including tackling your reported concerns and they have a laundry list of different issues that um are going to be addressed during an update on Sims 4 newsroom um that also affects multiple expansions um
5099955	5108107	and they're also looking at some of these bugs that have existed for years including one that's been there since 2016 um
5112159	5132174	there's just well and on top of that too I mean they've they've got that the modding system is easy to mod your game and I'm wondering if if they're not going to start patching out uh game altering mods you know like the remove the the the pixelation when they pee or something you know
5133403	5136146	Um, but, who knows?
5136866	5151779	I mean, I kind of quit playing Sims 4 because, I mean, apart from being able to afford stuff, you know, I just was like, I'm not, there were all kinds of bugs, especially when I was on one of my earlier computers.
5151919	5156103	Honestly, I think it played better on my Mac than it ever did on my PC, but still.
5159232	5167058	Yeah, it's really something that like Sims 4 is like still going all this time later and that something like this is neat.
5167078	5172002	Whereas like I think a lot of games that are this old, you know, kind of end up in autopilot mode.
5172143	5175765	I think it's fascinating to me that it's like this game is still so strong and so prevalent.
5176066	5178047	Yeah, I see streamers still playing the Sims 4.
5178888	5179629	It's wild.
5179929	5183192	But I mean, haven't there been like 100 expansions of Sims 4 too?
5183212	5186054	I mean, this game keeps printing money for EA for sure.
5187717	5194363	But I mean, the issues have existed for years and they honestly should have been addressed a while ago.
5195324	5209037	And more than that, when you're dealing with a game that functions primarily off of extra DLC, well, I mean, we don't know any other games that have problems like that, do we?
5209998	5210458	To my daylight.
5210478	5211179	Yeah.
5215630	5217251	Are they still working on a Sims 5?
5217411	5218953	I feel like that's always kind of rumbled.
5218973	5220874	They're always going to be working on one.
5220914	5221474	It is coming.
5221935	5222895	They've already announced it, I thought.
5223416	5224477	That's what they did too.
5225597	5227699	I wonder if that's something we'll get more word on this week.
5228420	5229060	Maybe with Naughty 3.
5230381	5235985	My big thing on my Naughty 3 wish list, I guess this will come out of the PC showcase because I don't know where else they'd put it.
5236546	5236786	Civ 7.
5237446	5238107	I'm ready for Civ 7.
5238487	5238827	Come on.
5239067	5239508	It's our year.
5239948	5240388	Let's do it.
5241598	5241858	Alright.
5242459	5248463	Anyway, well, speaking of naughty three announcements, some things are slipping out early, aren't they?
5248483	5249324	Naughty three leaks!
5251786	5270461	So yeah, we've got some naughty three leaks already that are going to become, well, we may see these actually on Sunday, so all related around Microsoft, and the first one is that there's a rumor that there's this game that used to exist under the codename Year Zero that is a brand new Doom game that's going to take place during the
5271201	5290846	Dark Ages, they're saying now the final name is Doom the Dark Ages and it's been in development for four years and we're supposed to be seeing that in this next um this announcement apparently inside Insider Gamer had heard early details of the game and um that's supposed to be coming and according to um
5292998	5293358	What was it?
5293499	5303169	According to a podcaster and insider, NateTheHate said that Doom the Dark Ages in fact will launch also on the PlayStation 5.
5303650	5307374	So it's going to be one of those multi-platform titles as well.
5308736	5309436	Along with that...
5310299	5311980	Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Game Pass
5335093	5351094	and then along with that it is also still coming to last gen consoles as well so the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One so that's also interesting probably because they still have a big user base there but more details to come on Sunday next Sunday
5351621	5352441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5376218	5380404	I can be done with work at 4 o'clock because I start early enough.
5380985	5383208	I hope we get another trailer.
5383308	5385811	Well, I'm sure we will because they like to hype the crap out of it.
5385912	5387514	But for Light, No Fire.
5388812	5390633	Yes, I want that so bad.
5390734	5393556	Yes, I love what Hello Games has been doing.
5394136	5400201	Even though I have to admit, so also something that came out while I was gone, they had a No Man's Sky patch come out with a new expedition.
5400281	5408267	And I have to say, I think it's the first time in a very long time where I kind of went, I read the patch notes and I went, meh, I'll skip it.
5409235	5423602	I know Still though, I mean No, still, I love No Man's Sky and I, yeah, and it's but yeah, the expedition I was like you know, even looking at the awards and everything I was like, meh, I'll probably skip it Oof 2 o'clock Pacific?
5424182	5430385	Uh I'm not gonna be able to make that, Bobby, it's a little too early It's a bummer Why can't they do it later?
5431496	5433897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5448846	5456813	Because in Mortal Kombat, for example, let me see if I can actually for you, those of you that are watching live on Twitch, I'll actually show you on the other screen here.
5457273	5465380	It's actually, this person has actually modded Goofy and Donald Duck from Kingdom Hearts into Mortal Kombat.
5466121	5467262	Oh, good lord.
5486881	5504433	uh Toasted Shoes says they've gotten an IP infringement notification from Warner Brothers and if they don't remove their Mortal Kombat 1 videos that channel will be hit with copyright strikes for each video um of course if those copyright strikes all added up the channel would basically be closed um
5506058	5506759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5520990	5524231	So, of course, Warner Brothers hasn't said anything on this yet, but here we go.
5524571	5529412	The second story tonight about a company where the right hand and the left hand are doing different things.
5529972	5533313	I was going to say, it might be something because it's Disney content.
5533553	5535573	Well, then Disney would be the one to send that email.
5536074	5536674	That's true.
5537054	5538154	So, I don't know.
5540355	5541375	Orange right in chat.
5541735	5545836	Gold star comment tonight saying, Garsh, your head just rips off so easily.
5545996	5546216	Yuck.
5548496	5549316	I would want to see that.
5549796	5551397	That's what we should be using AI for.
5551657	5552057	No!
5552457	5553097	For mods.
5553337	5553757	No!
5556378	5559638	ChatGPT, give me a goofy mod for Mortal Kombat 1.
5562459	5563819	Oh, Garsh, I hate it.
5563959	5570860	Alright, let's get into our next segment where we can talk about a real... No, we can't even talk about a real game.
5570941	5574421	Garsh, we're going to talk about a classic cancelled game tonight.
5574761	5578322	But let's roll the bumper and we'll get into it here right now.
5589742	5594566	But as we mentioned, once a month here in the year 2024, DarkSakura picks a
5607489	5610230	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5631343	5643792	It is a cancelled minigame compilation that's developed by Absolute Entertainment starring Penn & Teller, the famous magicians and debunker of Tomfoolery.
5646034	5651658	Also famous for a show I used to watch pretty regularly called Penn & Teller Bullshit.
5652608	5653148	Really good show.
5653809	5658833	Anyway, it had six minigames that you used to play practical jokes on others.
5659014	5668982	There were two party tricks and two multiplayer, quote, scams, in which one player can unfairly interrupt the gameplay or influence it.
5669062	5671424	There's the beat-em-up smoke and mirrors.
5671965	5680212	And Desert Bus, in which you drive a bus down an empty, straight road.
5681175	5684077	for eight hours to score 1.1.
5687720	5689201	And you can't just leave the bus there.
5689241	5692043	You gotta steer the thing or you will go off-road.
5693884	5702090	It was designed by Penn & Teller with Barry Marks and a concept provided by Eddie Gorodetsky.
5704472	5730933	it was announced to be released in 1994 and then was later rescheduled for April Fool's Day 1995 and they had the Sega CD version finished on time and review copies ready to go out Absolute Entertainment couldn't afford to do it so we'll get into a little bit more about this but I mean there are
5732179	5733160	Definitely mixed reviews.
5733180	5734440	People have since played it.
5735101	5748449	Even though Absolute Entertainment ceased its full operations in late 1995, they're still a little bit on the map for this whole...
5750322	5753264	You know, this whole shenanigans that went on with this.
5753945	5758489	So they had a planned PC and 3DO version.
5758649	5759810	Those, of course, were canceled.
5760450	5773721	The review copies were rediscovered, and an archivist named Frank Cifaldi shared one online in September 2005, and then things took off from there.
5773781	5776983	In fact, the Desert Best minigame was...
5778344	5786087	led to the charity Desert Bust for Hope, which is a charity livestream that was held in 2007 and turned into an annual event.
5787667	5798031	And that minigame has been remade unofficially a few times, especially a couple of Android and iOS versions for that charity, and a VR version by Gearbox in 2019.
5800660	5810547	So to go over some of the minigames, you have some full motion video that's introductions for each by Penn and Teller.
5812508	5823376	And it basically talks about the one who is aware of how the game functions and then the sucker.
5825186	5838725	and they have a hidden owner menu where the owner can set up the mini games to play practical jokes on the sucker so there's for the tricks there's What's Your Sign and Mofo the Psychic Gorilla
5840267	5847350	With What's Your Sign, the owner inputs the sucker's birthday in a menu beforehand.
5847550	5855953	And when the sucker is playing, Penn and Teller ask them questions and pretend to use their Persona meter to guess their astrological sign and birthday.
5857394	5861456	Mofo the Psychic Gorilla, the sucker draws a standard playing card.
5863075	5889915	but the owner has put it into the game and then the mofo can ask and then mofo the psychic gorilla can ask the sucker some questions even asking them to lie and then pretends they guessed the card which they know the card in Desert Bus you are driving a bus on a straight road between Tucson, Arizona and Las Vegas for the record I have been on this stretch of road
5890768	5913990	between Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas I guess it's the same one actually and it really is long and dull although you do pass Joshua Trees and that's cool it's a bummer because they could have done a sequel driving from Winnemucca to Boise which I would argue is the most boring piece of fucking road I've ever been on in my life well
5914736	5923042	Anyway, you open the doors at different bus stops in the LAL, but no one will get off or on.
5924083	5931188	You have a top speed of 45 miles an hour, or for those in smart countries that use metrics, 72 kilometers an hour.
5933209	5935511	And you have a length of 350 miles or 580 kilometers.
5935531	5936332	So, basically, one ride...
5942356	5944337	Takes 8 hours in real time.
5945298	5952201	The bus will automatically veer to the right so you have to keep controlling it and the game cannot be paused.
5952722	5958445	Completing a drive between the two cities gives you one point and the option to turn around and travel back in the other direction.
5959606	5967933	When you drive off the road or you get stuck in sand or overheat, it must be towed back to the previous stop in real time.
5970315	5981304	There was a planned competition where the highest scoring player would have joined Penn and Teller on a real trip from Tucson to Las Vegas in a party bus with a visit at the Rio Hotel and Casino.
5983066	6010096	there's the scams which is Buzzbombers and Sunscorcher Buzzbombers is a shoot-em-up like Space Invaders and you control Barry and Marshall and have to shoot animals to gain points and hitting larvae for a score penalty so you can choose the owner can choose to covertly give the player a disadvantage and then in Sunscorcher which is a space-themed shoot-em-up
6013017	6034406	it claims there's a thermographics that can endanger the players and it repeatedly has this enemy mothership that emits thermographics when defeated and then when the owner activates that scam the third defeat of the mothership will cause the game to play a sound of electric arcing and static
6035350	6043394	So then the owner would then act out being electrocuted by the game or that someone's broken the TV or something.
6044095	6059363	And then Smoke and Mirrors is a beat-em-up like Double Dragons where you control Penn and Teller to go take down the magician duo of Stinkbomb and Rot, a parody of Siegfried and Roy.
6060824	6067291	who have convinced the population that magic is real and in place of punches they shoot playing cards to defeat their enemy.
6068773	6078545	Debbie Harry and Lou Reed are also in there with Lou Reed in the impossible mode to always defeat the players.
6078945	6081566	Wait, I have a weird question, but I need to know the answer.
6082266	6085647	Was there, like, a war with Penn and Teller and Siegfried and Roy?
6085667	6090588	Because I never imagined that there was, like, a war, but now that I'm imagining, like, maybe they had beef?
6091108	6093049	Like, I don't know, like, you know.
6093069	6094289	I think competition.
6094349	6097370	Yuriko O'Hara and Kim Chi, like, maybe they had beef?
6097650	6098470	Like, maybe.
6099150	6100471	I kind of love that fantasy.
6100591	6101011	I don't know why.
6102642	6103784	I honestly don't know.
6103884	6110016	I mean, each of their forms of magic, their performances were completely different.
6110237	6110657	Oh, for sure.
6111741	6112862	Yeah.
6113783	6120650	As for how the game was developed, before it was in production, the company was already kind of in the shitter.
6120751	6132903	And one of the games they had, Goofy's Hysterical History Tour in 93, had a bunch of unsold inventory and would have cost the company millions of dollars to remove from customs.
6133564	6145514	So the producer, Barry Marks, who knew Gillette, conceived of the game and made a pitch and said you can be directly involved in it.
6147175	6160505	Eddie Gordetsky came up with the Desert Bus idea as an overly realistic and non-violent game in response to Janet Reno, who at the time was the United States Attorney General and opposed violence in video games.
6161346	6170174	and then Penn and Teller recorded their full motion video sequences with a blue screen and then they just got to it.
6170214	6175419	I mean, basically the characters for the Smoke and Mirrors minigame were rotoscoped
6178503	6184471	It was a bunch of different teams that just put this all together and made it work as a game.
6185793	6191261	The game was announced for Sega CD at 1994 CES Consumer Electronics Show.
6192422	6202848	and Absolute wanted to get it out by the 1994 Christmas season but with delays they rescheduled it for April 1st, 1995 which I'm sure was an apt name or apt date.
6203848	6206830	They announced a PC version at CES 1995
6210394	6221044	and the company's president was on stage with Penn & Teller and was really focusing on wanting to get that PC version out.
6221084	6223146	He was a big proponent of Windows 95.
6223567	6228251	He also talked about the 3DO version at E3 1995.
6231533	6250902	so the Sega CD version was finished on time as I said but they didn't have the money to release it and then stalled the other ones and so they changed the date to April 15th which also was not met there were press copies available they pushed it back to July 1995 for Sega CD in October 1995 for PC and
6254485	6261479	and then 1996 for 3DO and then they ceased operations and laid off most of their employees by late 1995.
6263081	6264882	and the game was put on indefinite hold.
6265462	6274965	According to Teller, who famously does not speak in a performance, the format was dead by that time and they couldn't find parties interested in acquiring the game.
6276505	6280386	The game, however, has been reviewed and got some pretty mixed reviews.
6280626	6288149	Captain Squidio for GamePro said that the controls to play efficiently were pretty complicated.
6289229	6315288	and once you learned them though that using them correctly was pretty satisfying the inconsistent graphic quality was panned a bit the sound however was sharp and clear according to CaptainSquidio and that desert bus was one of the best features in the game in fact some called it pretty hysterical even if boring so
6320434	6326253	One reviewer, though, Mean Machine Sega, said it was a crap idea that should be avoided.
6327614	6334018	So anyway, to move on with summing this up, it did have a pretty lasting legacy.
6336819	6352968	There was that press copy that was recovered in December 2000, and then Meston, who was one of the reviewers for Video Game Advisor, Zach Meston, said,
6354384	6379103	he worked he had actually reached out to Michael Thomason of Good Deal Games that had also released other cancelled Sega CD games but he wasn't able to get a publishing agreement with Penn & Teller and the managers holding over Absolute Entertainment's assets and so they abandoned the talk and so eventually um
6380803	6390772	Later that year, an activist named Frank Cifaldi obtained a backup of the review copy and published it on the Something Awful forums.
6391152	6391552	Remember them?
6392553	6395816	Including adding the torrent file to distribute it.
6395896	6397858	The torrent file is actually defunct now.
6397958	6404103	There's a new link by the website Waxy as of 2006.
6404804	6408087	And then there came Desert Bus for Hope.
6410891	6434971	Morgan Van Humbeck who is a member of a comedy group called Loading Ready Run obtained the game through Waxy and arranged the actually wanted to use it in a comedy sketch but eventually it turned into a fundraiser for Child's Play and now Desert Bus for Hope is an annual thing and there's a French version Desert Bus de l'Espoir
6436052	6436272	as of 2013.
6436593	6438354	There were remakes.
6438894	6447139	Amateur Pixels did an Android and iOS version for 99 cents in November 2011 with the proceeds going to charity.
6447799	6451442	Shiny Shoe did Desert Bus VR for Oculus Rift.
6452162	6455564	In 2014, there was a homebrew for the Wii.
6457185	6466589	And then there were also commercial copies put out for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision in 2013 and 2016, respectively.
6467670	6472873	Another free VR remake, also called Desert Bus VR, was published...
6474374	6479436	by Gearbox for Steam for the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive.
6481538	6486740	And then there was a PEGI-rated version for PS4.
6486760	6495966	And then there was Desert Limo in the 2014 game Roundabout and the 2018 user-created Map Revenant bus for Doom 2.
6497306	6499668	Also paid homage to the Desert bus.
6500595	6511413	and that's the game Penn and Teller's Smoke and Mirrors and fully completed never officially released but always eternal in our memory
6512981	6521889	You know, an interesting point that Bobby brought up in the chat room is that, you know, Desert Bus in some ways really inspired what happened with the creation of Games Done Quick.
6522249	6527714	You know, obviously, Desert Bus is the least quick game probably a person can think of.
6528194	6533879	But it's interesting that that kind of charity event lent itself to, you know, the GDQ event, even though...
6534599	6536181	They can make money doing it slow.
6536221	6537482	We can make money doing it fast.
6537542	6538022	That's right.
6538443	6546609	And I want to say Penn and Teller, you know, finally one of those years during Desert Bus, they actually donated one year, which I actually thought was really cool.
6546949	6550873	Yeah, I think they were into it when they saw, you know, what it was being used for.
6551013	6552013	Yeah, yeah.
6552853	6581966	so very cool all right well that's a that's a heck of a classic game uh that got canceled that's what the whole point of of this segment was that it was a collection of mini games yeah yeah Desert Bus was uh just just one of many games in this part of it and uh but I don't I don't know I did not think any of the games looked particularly good myself but it was it was from a different time too you know I feel like some of those early CD-ROM games a lot of them were kind of
6582961	6583461	A little messy.
6584823	6585824	Yeah.
6586324	6589387	For the record, I got bored in five seconds and said, let's go.
6589587	6590128	Let's go.
6590208	6590949	I was like, let's go.
6591109	6591369	All right.
6591949	6595072	Let's get into some rapid fire news before we go tonight.
6595152	6598516	So let's travel around the industry and check out some other headlines going on.
6598596	6599477	So Loki, we'll start with you.
6600407	6610353	Yes, Blaze Entertainment has announced the Evercade Alpha, which is a bar-top arcade cabinet that plays the Evercade games.
6610693	6612194	At least some of the Evercade games.
6613335	6619418	So with that, their first collection that they have with it is a Capcom collection.
6619719	6624982	And what's kind of cool about it, though, is it actually has different marquees that you can put in it as well.
6625482	6649397	so there's the Mega Man Power Fighters version that's available that comes with those looks like Final Fight, Strider, Knights of the Round, and Carrier Air Wing then there's also a Street Fighter version that you can get as well that comes with Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 1 through 3
6652446	6657171	Also, they have pretty nice joysticks in there as well.
6657211	6659153	I think they were like Sanwa joysticks in there.
6659333	6662777	I'm going to imagine those cabs are very similar to the Ms.
6662817	6666701	Pac-Man minicab that I have behind me when we do OLR.
6666721	6670064	Because this was about $120 from Arcade1Up.
6670104	6671506	I think I got it on sale at Target.
6671826	6672066	and so on.
6691615	6693837	But I think the Evercade is going to look like this.
6694217	6698320	I'm actually super interested in one just because I have the Evercade versus anyway.
6698420	6699621	So I think these cabinets will be good.
6699881	6706866	But I'm far more interested in the Mega Man one because, and as you can imagine, having two people stand at this time, that's not going to happen.
6707486	6727491	so the Street Fighter stuff is really more of a novelty thing especially if it doesn't get online and do that whole thing so I think the other cabinet is going to be more interesting to me but just the fact that you can do cartridges and do more games is also interesting however, I'll quickly say this because it came up on Bobby's show something that isn't really out there about Evercade that needs to be
6728351	6730253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6751590	6779555	they do not play in my Evercade Versus when you put them in there it says sorry these games are not licensed for this console they only work on the Evercade handheld that's lame super lame super lame so just heads up be aware of that and I would not expect those cartridges are going to work in a minicab either because you're literally looking at other Namco games in this minicab so I don't know we'll see we'll see
6780899	6781880	Yeah.
6782120	6789745	Along with that, there was that homebrew... It's a strange concept that a homebrew...
6791055	6792356	That's part of the charm.
6820865	6821846	Yep, that is the charm.
6821986	6826849	It's on itch.io and it's apparently going to be coming to Steam very soon as well.
6827189	6827389	Nice.
6827409	6827969	So look for that.
6828490	6828890	DarkSakura.
6832413	6834094	Well, this is interesting.
6834134	6835995	And honestly, it's already there.
6836956	6840619	World of Warcraft is available in GeForce Now.
6841379	6847223	That's including the classic version, Dragonflight and Cataclysm Classic.
6848784	6853987	And also a few other things, such as Rogue Prince of Persia.
6855768	6860291	And later on in June, we're getting Resident Evil Village and Street Fighter VI.
6861572	6882802	and honestly enough like uh I've been playing games on there for an age and it tends to be pretty smooth I mean I play for the top tier of it because I stream from it but it's a great service I'm you know I was kind of thinking I you know I saw it on there and I was like well maybe I should play WoW again and then I was like no and I was like let's go
6885402	6885763	Alright.
6886624	6887165	It's a cool deal.
6888527	6897460	And honestly, that works out for people who maybe have surfaces, for example, so that they can have a way to play the game.
6898641	6898882	Alright.
6899602	6908965	Well, one more story for you, and this actually came up last week while we were out, but it's definitely worth talking about, and that is Nintendo has announced they will be opening a second store in the U.S.
6909425	6917707	So right now, Nintendo only has one official store in the U.S., and that's in New York City at 30 Rockefeller, or not 30 Rock, but at Rockefeller Center.
6918607	6925069	But Nintendo is going to be opening a second store in a somewhat similar sort of location on the other coast.
6925469	6928570	It's going to be in San Francisco, and it's going to be in Union Square.
6928590	6929070	What?
6929350	6929951	We're going.
6930091	6933953	Which is funny because I just spent the night last night in Union Square.
6934013	6936775	We got a hotel room at Union Square for after the concert.
6937075	6939537	So it's kind of funny hearing that Nintendo is going to have a store there.
6940057	6943660	But they haven't said where or what storefront it's replacing.
6943700	6952966	But unfortunately, as we all know, a lot of the stores in Union Square have been closing because of whether it's the COVID and things that that did.
6953386	6957649	There's been a lot of talk about the thefts in mass and all that and what effect that's had.
6957689	6958470	Although I've noticed...
6959150	6965333	There's a lot like Neiman Marcus has one of those doors that only so many people can get through at once.
6965413	6969775	The spinning doors that you usually see in cities with more worse weather like snow and stuff.
6969795	6971556	You see the spinning doors a lot more frequently.
6972597	6976979	So I don't know if that's a thing or what, but also security guards at every store.
6977839	6978440	Security Guards.
6978860	6979720	So it's just interesting.
6980541	6989748	But there's been a lot of stores in San Francisco Union Square that have closed, but there are others that are opening to kind of take that place, which will be very interesting.
6989808	6990629	So yeah, I'm excited.
6991349	6994812	And absolutely, when DarkSakura says we're going, yeah, we are.
6995192	6999615	We're going to go get brunch in the Castro, and then we're going to go shopping, and then we're going to be broke.
7000916	7001897	So it is the second official.
7002197	7003058	Again, we don't know a lot.
7003098	7004559	We just know it's going to be called Nintendo San Francisco.
7004579	7005280	I've already been to the mall.
7006570	7008171	and it will open in 2025.
7009371	7010132	We just don't know when.
7011072	7012472	More details in the future.
7012613	7016374	I would imagine this might actually pop in in a Nintendo Direct.
7016834	7029760	Maybe not as soon as the one that's rumored for, you know, not E3 period this month, but maybe in a few months we'll hear a little more information about exactly where it's going and people will be able to figure out which storefront it in fact is replacing.
7030300	7032321	So, all right.
7033427	7034648	Well, let's move on.
7034868	7036550	I hope it's got the full Pokemon Center too.
7036570	7040713	But I imagine it's got to be a multi-story storefront there.
7041093	7046678	And you know, Nintendo had a presence in San Francisco, not on the retail front, but they used to have a big office there.
7046698	7047699	They might still have one.
7047739	7049400	I think they laid a lot of people off there, sadly.
7050521	7053804	I think they may have relocated the people that stayed to Washington.
7053864	7056887	But Nintendo used to have a pretty sizable presence in San Francisco.
7056927	7060630	So it's interesting that they are coming back in a different way.
7062003	7063744	It's like, well, if Sega's here, we are too.
7064585	7065766	Is Sega still in San Francisco?
7066086	7067527	No, I was saying at the time.
7068368	7070289	I don't even think Zynga's in that building now.
7070550	7070870	I don't think.
7070890	7071150	No.
7071330	7074553	Yeah, I think that building is... Zynga, LOL.
7075333	7078616	All right, let's move on and travel the world and check out some release dates.
7079336	7080678	See how busy this week is.
7080818	7081598	Loki in the U.S.
7081858	7082119	Nah.
7083024	7084264	Very busy at all.
7084385	7093068	So this week we've got a few things starting off with the Elder Scrolls Online Gold Road expansion coming out on PC and Mac.
7093628	7096449	We have Destiny 2 The Final Shape, another expansion as well.
7096909	7100550	That's on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
7101170	7107853	Killer Clowns from Outer Space The Game on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
7108939	7114645	Star Wars Hunters on Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android, Blockbuster Inc.
7114925	7116546	It's a simulation game.
7117527	7120550	Sounds interesting on a PC.
7120891	7125115	I wonder if that's based off the store or off of like just making movies or something.
7125135	7131241	I feel like I heard about a simulator game like that, but how would they be able to use the actual name?
7132438	7132718	I don't know.
7132758	7134138	You could license it.
7134619	7137799	I don't know who owns it, but maybe it's licensable.
7138019	7140880	Somebody in the middle of Oregon has that one last store.
7140940	7142921	No, I think there is a license.
7142941	7145561	Yeah, so Blockbuster Inc.
7147382	7158024	And then we've got, let's see, Rider Spirit on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
7158885	7160365	So that is it.
7161448	7163829	Alright, and just the Blockbuster Inc.
7163889	7165290	has nothing to do with the company.
7165870	7172593	It is a next generation simulation game where you take the reins of your movie studio and pave your way to the cinematic hall of fame.
7172613	7174854	See, I kind of figured that that might have been what it was.
7175175	7180977	Which means all of your movies must be based on an existing IP and have a star already attached to it.
7181017	7182158	That's how you beat Blockbuster Inc.
7182677	7183478	Eh, that's fine.
7183618	7183838	All right.
7184879	7187942	Moving on, let's go to Japan and check out the releases that are coming out there.
7188583	7194228	On the Nintendo Switch, Toohu Special Carnival is out in a regular edition and a carnival edition.
7194348	7194948	I mean, why not?
7195769	7202936	Seven Days, Anata to Sugosu Nanokanakan is coming out as well in a regular and limited edition.
7204017	7207040	Also, Mistonia no Kibu, The Lost Delight.
7207560	7210083	in a regular and, you guessed it, limited edition.
7210404	7218754	So those are all out on the 6th on the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 5 is also getting the Tuho Special Carnival is also... Toho.
7218995	7220076	Toho Special Carnival.
7220096	7221658	Why do I do Japanese release dates?
7222119	7224442	Like... I kind of wonder...
7225903	7227805	It is kind of funny.
7227845	7234292	This joke is getting old, but anyway, so am I. Alright, but that is coming out on the PlayStation 5.
7234592	7236734	That's the one release that's coming out there, so enjoy.
7237555	7238095	How about Europe?
7239817	7240938	Only a handful of things.
7241899	7247125	We have on the 6th for Switch and PlayStation, the Smurfs Village Party.
7248174	7269946	and then on the 7th for Playstation PC and Switch we have Wrath Aeon of Ruin and then for Playstation and Switch we have Jurassic Park Classic Game Collection a game, I wonder oh wait, I think I do that's like the classic Super Nintendo games, isn't it?
7270446	7274428	right, that's the one that's being put out by Limited Run I think oh, that's pretty cool
7276089	7277810	Alright.
7278270	7279571	Let's move on.
7279871	7286235	We have just a couple more stories for you and then we'll get to maybe your emails if we have any, your calls, all that good stuff.
7286835	7287656	But first, Loki.
7288776	7305226	Yeah, I don't know what's going on with Take-Two, but there's been a lot of mixed messaging that we've seen with Take-Two as far as what they're doing with their indie studios, but apparently they're trying to get rid of their indie label, Private Division.
7305966	7315449	They've quietly been laying people off at those different studios, even though they've also said, no, no, no, we're not doing that.
7315609	7317450	So I don't know.
7317570	7327713	But according to sources talking to IGN, they said the whole layout situation proved that what we already felt, Take-Two could not care less about its employees.
7330376	7354729	so yeah I guess we'll see if there's going to be more layoffs happening I mean despite what they're saying it does sound like that they're like well we're making tons of money with Grand Theft Auto let's just keep making money there and yeah fuck them indies quote attributed they have so much they have so much money that they could really just run that studio with the Grand Theft Auto money but I don't know
7355936	7382207	you know what sometimes though the artsy games are less of an investment and you actually make more money on the dollar than something like the marketing that's going to go into Grand Theft Auto 6 which oh honey you are not prepared for how much marketing there's going to be for Grand Theft Auto 6 when that game finally comes out every bus in the fucking country every bus stop every they'll probably put it on jet planes southwest planes nope it's going to be Grand Theft Auto Air for the next six months
7383187	7384308	Grand Theft Aviator.
7384368	7386010	Yeah, it's going to be all of it.
7386130	7386470	All of it.
7387351	7387652	All right.
7389053	7408326	Uh moving on we have a kind of a sad and interesting footnote because we know that you know Microsoft closed some studios and we heard that Hi-Fi Rush was able to get one last update out before the teams were you know essentially let go and it appears the same as happening with Redfall.
7408366	7413169	We knew that they were going to end up doing a final update well we had heard that a final update
7413829	7415131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7432653	7458238	so the final update which is 1.451.3 which by the way I guess 451 is a significant number in Immersive Sims but it's the one that adds the offline mode to Redfall which was the feature that people wanted at launch and that means you can pause the game now also good news in single player anyway you can pause the game so if you get too scared you have to go pee then you can do that now in the game so
7458658	7463922	There's also a few systems that get reworked, like rewarding better rewards and better streamlined.
7464282	7473249	The neighborhood system got retooled, and there's a new meter called Community Standing, which when you unlock a new safe house or complete safe house missions, rescue civilians or killing an underboss.
7474250	7478854	Yeah, there's 39 rewards to be earned from completing all of those challenges.
7479754	7483897	Yeah, so it sounds like it's a pretty meaty update to the game, but unfortunately, that's it.
7484879	7487490	as Arcane Austin closes its doors.
7488634	7488915	Sad.
7490345	7496067	Alright, well, Breakman in chat says, is there an update to make the game fun?
7496127	7497648	Well, that depends on your opinion of fun.
7498068	7500169	I was going to ask, does that make it good?
7500309	7504871	Well, some people were really turned off by the multiplayer elements and the fact that you had to play with other people.
7504991	7508312	So the fact that this is out there, that might make it fun for you right there.
7508372	7509953	It kind of depends what was missing for you.
7510453	7511674	I don't really know how to answer that.
7512974	7515195	But if you're a Game Pass user, you can go grab it.
7517148	7518610	We ain't found shit.
7537529	7539451	We don't have anybody on the line yet either.
7540311	7541452	And I know it's a weird week.
7541512	7543754	We got a lot of news on the horizon.
7544615	7546497	But Loki, did we happen to miss anything?
7546517	7547998	Did you want to do any last minute stories with us?
7548839	7549039	No.
7549479	7549719	No?
7549739	7550480	We don't have anything.
7550560	7556645	Everyone's keeping their cards close to the vest because, you know, Key 3 is up on us.
7556845	7557366	That's right.
7558407	7558727	I don't know.
7558827	7565693	I feel like a lot of shows do predictions for E3, but it's like, what can you predict at this point?
7567703	7582833	I'd rather be surprised exactly I think I already said I would love to see Civ 7 that's the thing I most want to see but if it doesn't happen then alright let me down one more time it's cool I know it'll happen eventually so there's that
7584473	7584893	You know what?
7584913	7586874	Maybe a Nintendo stunt would be fun.
7587054	7593117	I would love to see a Nintendo stunt, meaning that they announce on Tuesday that they're going to do a direct on Thursday or something like that.
7593897	7594577	But who knows?
7594657	7595718	Nintendo could.
7595878	7597579	Nintendo's worked with Keeley before.
7598079	7601920	They could do something at the Keeley event, but not the Switch 2.
7602921	7603561	Not the Switch 2.
7604101	7604341	No.
7604721	7606582	But don't put your expectations there.
7607122	7610504	I would say maybe like a port...
7611204	7612105	of a Wii U game.
7612145	7615289	Maybe your Xenoblade Chronicles reveal would be a cool thing.
7616050	7616510	XCX.
7617051	7624140	The XCX reveal for this Switch, hoping it happens, might be a thing that happens at Keeley 3.
7626243	7628164	Alright, well then we wrap it up.
7628264	7628885	That's the show.
7629265	7630946	Thank you all so much for tuning in tonight.
7631326	7633887	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry, tell a friend or two.
7634248	7638410	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7638950	7645794	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, or Spotify goes an awful long way, so please consider those reviews.
7645894	7646875	We really appreciate it.
7648035	7648376	And yeah.
7648976	7649056	Um...
7666474	7666834	stuff.
7667455	7680085	I really am without many thoughts right now except I got two weeks of training to do and I'm gonna take it out on people in Dead by Daylight.
7680806	7681366	Good times.
7681486	7681947	Well, have fun.
7683188	7684148	Bye.
7684288	7684609	Bye.
7685730	7686650	Loki, then we'll go to you.
7686690	7687611	What's your final thought tonight?
7689713	7694797	Final thought is I got a lot of work to do in Minecraft, I guess.
7695778	7696078	A lot of
7697029	7698692	Gotta get rolling on that theme park.
7698712	7700316	It's coming.
7701057	7701237	Soon.
7702864	7708966	My final thought is, again, I'm so fortunate for all of you that have listened on and off throughout the years.
7709066	7713087	Thank you so much for those of you that spend time with us.
7713207	7716347	I know it's a long commitment to listen to this show every week, so I appreciate it.
7716387	7719408	So thank you so much to all of you who take part with this show every week.
7720208	7724829	Also, I know it has been quite some time since I've done a stream on my personal channel.
7725230	7730691	That's because I've just been very busy, but some of that busy is starting to clear, so I am going to
7731431	7734292	Do a stream again tomorrow.
7734732	7740134	And I've been working on some stuff behind the scenes to try to liven things up over on my channel.
7740174	7745396	I finally have built in some new scenes and working with full integration of stream elements.
7745516	7747397	Basically, I've rebuilt everything from the ground up.
