00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:42,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

2
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:46,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:57,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live with you all once again with episode number 1009 for tonight, June the 23rd of 2024.

4
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:02,988
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as joined by my co-hosts.

5
00:01:03,168 --> 00:01:05,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

7
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, hello, and happy birthday.

8
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:11,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks!

9
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 22.

10
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been radioing.

11
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:46,315
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this shit, trademark patent bending, for 22 years.

12
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we've been powered by vibes for 22 years.

13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,821
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

14
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:57,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because that's, I don't know, is that what they're calling it these days?

15
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:58,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Vibes?

16
00:01:58,405 --> 00:01:59,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Vibes, oh yeah, oh yeah.

17
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:01,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were just poppers in spite.

18
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:02,549
Yeah.

19
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:05,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, that's for the club, never mind.

20
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:08,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's what Justin Timberlake had in his system.

21
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, let me say hello to the one and only, of course, it wouldn't be a birthday without Techmaster Loki.

22
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:16,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

23
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:17,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Loki, how are you doing?

24
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,922
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

25
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:58,631
[SPEAKER_05]: and Loki oftentimes has games because he doesn't want to show the world his kitchen and I understand that I respect that so he has games that play behind him so what what game is this tonight because I'm not familiar with this although it looks very like this earthbound in 2024 it's it's like a Zelda like it's called hashtag blood b-l-u-d okay it's basically a uh

26
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:08,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a Zelda-like game where you are a girl that's a transfer to a new town and she ends up involved in vampire hunting.

27
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:09,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

28
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:12,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it looks like a Saturday morning cartoon.

29
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:13,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

30
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:15,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that happened when I moved to California.

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: You turned into a vampire?

32
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,641
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I turned into a vampire hunter.

33
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

34
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:22,544
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a man?

35
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,085
[SPEAKER_05]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

36
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:25,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Crash.

37
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,207
[SPEAKER_01]: But enough talk.

38
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,328
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you?

39
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:57,414
[SPEAKER_05]: that's that's what you mean when you say Vampire Hunter is just you you learned how to play many different versions of Symphony of the Night as well as um what the hell is that I can't even remember the original name of Castlevania 5 at this point oh my god embarrassed Castlevania 5 what you mean Rondo of Blood yes Rondo of Blood that was just Dracula X it was kind of its own thing yeah well wasn't that the one they ported the Super Nintendo was Castlevania 5 and it was like

40
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:01,397
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they brought that over as Castlevania Bloodlines, I think.

41
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:04,941
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the one that was Super Castlevania 5 or whatever?

42
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Super Castlevania 4.

43
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:08,205
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know there was that.

44
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:12,550
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Castlevania 5, but it was funky.

45
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was just a bad port of Rondo of Blood, if I remember right.

46
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:18,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

47
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:28,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was Dracula X. But it was just, I mean, I had never seen it on the package.

48
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:35,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I just always thought it was, no, Castlevania Bloodlines was the one that was on Genesis.

49
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was just Dracula X.

50
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:45,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it just, it was weird because it felt like Konami, it just felt weird.

51
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:49,435
[SPEAKER_05]: They just slapped the name on it even though it was the same quality.

52
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,376
[SPEAKER_05]: The port wasn't any way on the Super Nintendo.

53
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:53,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the port was good for what it was.

54
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,282
[SPEAKER_01]: If no one had known about the TurboGrafx version, it would have been just fine.

55
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:58,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true, true, true.

57
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:05,719
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura says it's on the Castlevania Advance Collection randomly.

58
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I mean, it's still there, so there is that.

59
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:15,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I do want to thank our chatters because I do see that a hype train is going as we are taping live here.

60
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks to be a little bit of a birthday hype train, so just want to

61
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:19,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day.

62
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:47,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

63
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:47,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

64
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:50,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who doesn't celebrate myself every day?

65
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,849
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times can Ubisoft put out Beyond Good and Evil Remastered?

66
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the limit does not exist, right?

67
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we can celebrate one more time this year if we want to.

68
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:02,554
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no, I just...

69
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:04,916
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

70
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:53,338
[SPEAKER_05]: um you know with all that and um we actually will get the occasional comment now on our YouTube channel which is nice so um I want to give a shout out to uh the comment from underworld7949 on our last episode who said I love your show you guys and gal make me laugh and very informative lol with three exclamation points so you know they mean it so thank you for that three entire exclamation points that's right I am honored yes so thank you for that not a single interrobang I mean because that's what I think every time I'm live

71
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gosh.

72
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I so want to ask you.

73
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you hang out with me, really?

74
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are jokes that I can make.

75
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:10,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of reasons, but there are jokes I can make that only you understand.

76
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You speak a certain level of nerd.

77
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:30,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, after a while, I think that friends like, especially, well, not even I would say just friends in general, but like people, when they are around each other a lot, you know, I think that people develop like an entire communication system between them.

78
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

79
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:44,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is so obvious watching the Trixie and Katya stuff online, you know, two drag queens, which is funny because my understanding is they don't really hang out outside of that.

80
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:55,171
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is a conscious artistic choice to keep those podcasts and those things that they do like pure, like that really is the way they catch up and get to talk to each other is by doing those shows.

81
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, you see a lot of that.

82
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:00,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But they definitely seem to speak a language that is like mental telepathy.

83
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,656
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

84
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:46,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo did a direct this week and there's a lot to say about it so I'll have Loki get us into that in just a moment but DarkSakura I'm curious um you know you know we love to talk about a little dead by daylight on this show and I'm kind of curious and I'm going to warn the listeners I am going to go into potential spoiler but it's based on rumors territory have you heard the rumors I'm sure you have that are really gaining steam about Tuesday's survivor announcement

85
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:47,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And who is?

86
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be Lara Croft.

87
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Lara Croft.

88
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:50,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

89
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been paying attention to it, but it's been everywhere all over my feed.

90
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just like, maybe?

91
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.

92
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:09,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and it fits with all the stuff because they said in a previous, one of their, you know, direct to fans transmissions that this next survivor embodies what it is to be a survivor.

93
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:17,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you put that in the context of like Lara Croft in the last trilogy, it's like, oh yeah, that quote makes perfect sense for that character.

94
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Hasn't she had enough bad days?

95
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:20,129
[SPEAKER_05]: She really has.

96
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:23,131
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to be stuck in the realm dying every day.

97
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:24,291
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

98
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing about Lara Croft in Dead by Daylight.

99
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:29,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she'll look fantastic and she'll play fantastic.

100
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,098
[SPEAKER_05]: If they do a legendary $10 skin, they better have triangle tits, Lara Croft.

101
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I will switch my mane to triangle tits, Lara Croft.

102
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:45,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go look at a PlayStation 1 port of Tomb Raider.

103
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:50,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Who has been this ultimate survivor thing?

104
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any pre-release stuff.

105
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:58,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they said it in the anniversary broadcast when they were teasing their roadmap.

106
00:09:58,965 --> 00:09:59,946
[SPEAKER_05]: They said something about that.

107
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:04,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we going to have a showdown between Pyramid Head and Pyramid Boob?

108
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,327
[SPEAKER_04]: One can only hope.

109
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:12,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they specifically mentioned anything about Tomb Raider.

110
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:15,187
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they didn't say two, but they just said a new survivor.

111
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:24,234
[SPEAKER_05]: They said something about the new survivor embodies what, yeah, it could, but when you look at Lara Croft, you go, oh, but the rumor is not just about that quote.

112
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:30,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one of those, when you look back at some of those really stretch hints they've dropped, they do fit.

113
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it could be Reba McEntire.

114
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:36,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get my hopes up like that, y'all.

115
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:42,448
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a single mom who loves her kids, works two jobs, and all that.

116
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,252
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a survivor.

117
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:50,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And as she's on the hook, she's screaming, here's your one chance, fancy, don't let me down.

118
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Or no, you should get me down.

119
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:52,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, exactly.

120
00:10:56,457 --> 00:11:03,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I hope it is Lara Croft and just because I want the triangle tits skin and nothing would really make me happier.

121
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:11,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I don't think, I think we would get more like this is her original look and this is her like professor look.

122
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,641
[SPEAKER_05]: She has different costumes in the games.

123
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:16,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they'd give her some of those, but I don't think we would actually get triangle tits.

124
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:23,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I would like is for them to give the other survivors voice lines now since all the new ones have them.

125
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:23,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

126
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,012
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want Dwight to sound like Dwight from the Salmonation one.

127
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:31,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm going to go stay in my locker.

128
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:36,435
[SPEAKER_05]: D'Artisio points out, I mean, if they got Nicolas Cage, anything is possible.

129
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:40,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Dead by Daylight actors and actresses, although she's... Jennifer Tilly?

130
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:42,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello!

131
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:42,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

132
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:43,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I love her.

133
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:52,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though she's not in the game, I did think of you, DarkSakura, because I was at a horror convention locally this weekend because they were gracious enough to have me hosting the cosplay contest, which was great.

134
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But Shawnee Smith, who played Amanda, a.k.a.

135
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,709
[SPEAKER_05]: the pig in the Saw movies, was actually there.

136
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:04,114
[SPEAKER_05]: So I saw her from a distance, but her table was packed, obviously, so I didn't wait around to say hi to her.

137
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:06,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I thought of you because I know you love Amanda, so...

138
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the funny, I'd like, I haven't seen the movies.

139
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:16,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've watched like enough put together scenes that I could avoid all the parts I don't want to watch.

140
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:16,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

141
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I actually don't care for the movies at all.

142
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,785
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand why people are into them.

143
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:22,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.

144
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,127
[SPEAKER_01]: The character.

145
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:40,588
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like the actress too Yeah, that's the thing I can say I don't like the movies Because they're literally not for me It's like a cake that's a flavor I don't like I can still say this is a good cake for somebody It probably tastes real good But this is not a cake for me

146
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:45,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sure that the creator is sitting back going, well, I didn't make it for you.

147
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:49,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a Frank-in-Furter line in Rocky Horror Fiction?

148
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:50,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a Frank-in-Furter.

149
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, I don't like guys with too many muscles.

150
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:53,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make him for you.

151
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make him for you.

152
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:57,695
[SPEAKER_05]: She gets him anyway.

153
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Oop, plot giveaway.

154
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:07,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, you will be proud of me because I did bust out on stream in response to a friend, one of my favorite Frank-in-Furter lines.

155
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:07,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

156
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:12,436
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so hard having a good time even smiling makes my face ache

157
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, oh my God.

158
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:21,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I was going to say though, one thing about the Saw movies and cakes, um, the acting is really good.

159
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:27,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I can still say those movies are not for me, but I recognize that like Tobin Bell especially is very, very good in those movies.

160
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shawnee Smith is very good as well.

161
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:32,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So like they're very well acted in the main roles anyway.

162
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:37,471
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the, you know, other roles are a little silly, but, um, the, the main roles are acted very, very well.

163
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:38,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll give it that.

164
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:39,613
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

165
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:55,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's get into the news I think y'all really want to hear about, which is, you know, and we knew this would happen at some point, that Nintendo would just come out and say, you know what, we feel like doing a direct tomorrow at the crack of dawn, so get up and be ready.

166
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did they do on Monday?

167
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,538
[SPEAKER_05]: They said Tuesday, get up, 7 a.m., we've got some games to announce.

168
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:02,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Get up, get your coffee.

169
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:05,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, listen up, bitches, a 10 is speaking.

170
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:09,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, a Nintendo is speaking.

171
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen up, bitches, a Ninten is speaking.

172
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,882
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so Loki, what did our Ninten have to say?

173
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:30,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was lots of game announcements, a lot of third-party stuff shown, but pretty much a lot of the core Nintendo franchises have announcements.

174
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:34,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, if they showed third-party announcements, did they happen to show Just Dance 2025?

175
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:39,683
[SPEAKER_05]: If only anyone could have predicted that.

176
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:40,763
[SPEAKER_04]: If only.

177
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:42,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was so unexpected.

178
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:43,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh my god.

179
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:44,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

180
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:45,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew?

181
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like literally betting that, like, it's like reverse roulette.

182
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:50,126
[SPEAKER_05]: You're betting on the wheel.

183
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Any number except double zero will come up.

184
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good odds.

185
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:55,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

186
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:55,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

187
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:07,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had starting things off Mario & Luigi Brothership, which is a brand new entry into the Mario & Luigi franchise, and it looks pretty cool.

188
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the art style that they have there.

189
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:14,871
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice that the series is continuing, because if I'm not mistaken, the studio that used to make it... In like nine years or something like that?

190
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:15,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the studio's...

191
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,133
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

192
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:36,224
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another trailer for Nintendo World Championship NES Edition.

193
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I'm really hyped about.

194
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:41,746
[SPEAKER_05]: As somebody really into retro, I think this looks fucking rad.

195
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be a fun game to stream.

196
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:44,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

197
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan was saying he'd be interested in it too.

198
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.

199
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be a fun game to stream.

200
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:57,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say hello in our chat to Rin Mari, who says, to be honest, I don't go into Nintendo Directs with any expectation at this point.

201
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:58,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Rin-chan!

202
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: If I see stuff I like, great.

203
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,455
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, life goes on.

204
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, I'm a weirdo who likes obscure shit.

205
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:09,825
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you have to go into Nintendo Directs with that attitude or you will be disappointed every single time.

206
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the right attitude to go into Directs with.

207
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:17,334
[SPEAKER_01]: This is always the person I think of whenever anyone says Toho.

208
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:27,377
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why Nintendo had to say, go out of their way to say, we will not be saying anything about Switch 2 in this.

209
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:28,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was part of the announcement as well.

210
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you bitches were still disappointed.

211
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the way Nintendo fans can be sometimes.

212
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:36,785
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no, that's the right attitude to approach Nintendo Direct.

213
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:37,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Just...

214
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Be ready to absorb the information.

215
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Set your expectations reasonable.

216
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:51,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even like to participate in the prediction game because people always just put these things out there that are just not realistic always.

217
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,160
[SPEAKER_05]: They might get one right.

218
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, roulette wheel analogy.

219
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:58,005
[SPEAKER_05]: They might land on the right spot occasionally, but it's very, very rare.

220
00:16:58,345 --> 00:16:58,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

221
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so with that, they did show like a few new game modes.

222
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:06,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a survival mode where you're kind of competing different challenges with people.

223
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:10,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like kind of the Tetris 100 or Mario 100 games that they had.

224
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:15,210
[SPEAKER_04]: or 99, sorry, Tetris 99.

225
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I believe, I don't think they announced a release date before then, but it's coming out July 18th, so right around the corner for that.

226
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:27,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

227
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:36,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Fairy Tail 2, so another anime RPG that's going to be coming out this winter.

228
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we had Fantasian Nero Dimension.

229
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:41,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantasian.

230
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

231
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:46,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming out on the Switch this holiday.

232
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:48,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also multi-platform.

233
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,395
[SPEAKER_05]: That means PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Steam.

234
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:58,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game is like very clearly had a two-year exclusive agreement with Apple Arcade and a whole lot more people are going to get to play it now.

235
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's, yeah, I'm really excited for Fantasian.

236
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this game for over a year.

237
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, yeah, you, and to be fair, I don't think a lot of people really discovered it on Apple Arcade.

238
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's great that, you know, it's going to get that wider audience.

239
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:14,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the same thing would be- It's fucking delightful.

240
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and the same thing would be true about a game like Final Fantasy XVI.

241
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:20,630
[SPEAKER_05]: When that goes, I don't know why my follow alert cheer just went off.

242
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

243
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:23,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody must have just followed my personal channel.

244
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:24,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry about that.

245
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:26,774
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what that noise was.

246
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I killed all those-

247
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:58,888
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys didn't hear it but it makes a Windows 95 startup noise so anyway no please don't apologize for following my channel it's just I don't know why that's coming through on the VOG ones but I'll figure it out anyway with cutting edge development and technology we are now finally able to have basketball in Nintendo Switch Sports so that's going to be another free update that's coming later this summer

248
00:18:59,028 --> 00:18:59,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

249
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another game, Mio, or Memories in Orbit.

250
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:35,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be coming out in 2025.

251
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:40,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the art style with that.

252
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:47,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another update video for Disney's Illusion Island.

253
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be getting a brand new update called Mystery in Monoth.

254
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is coming...

255
00:19:55,696 --> 00:20:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: actually that came out already that was a day and date type of thing it's out now hello kitty island adventure game of the show 2025 I've had that game for a while on Apple Arcade it's cute another one going multi-platform at this point game of the show

256
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:42,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Looney Tunes, Wacky World of Sports Not Game of the Show Among Us, getting a new update on the Switch with three new roles So that's kind of cool And that was also one of those day and date things Farmagia

257
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:52,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a farming monster gathering sim that's going to be coming out November 1st on the Switch.

258
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:55,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say Farmagia?

259
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Farmagia.

260
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:01,671
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain immediately thought you were going to say it's a game about cheese.

261
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:22,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see where you would think that, yes I literally thought the Pope was here throwing around slurs again I thought that's what Loki said It's like they're trying to combine farm and magic and add an I and it's like farm magic I would seriously play a game about cheese though, I'm just letting you know

262
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's the special event in Pikmin Bloom right now is Cheese Pikmin.

263
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:31,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually finished my set of Cheese Pikmin after like 15 days.

264
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I never finish a set that early in the month.

265
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:34,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they supposed to be flowers?

266
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:35,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're cheese now?

267
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:41,137
[SPEAKER_05]: No, in the mobile game, they get all sorts of things from real-life locations and stuff.

268
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:44,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll get Chinese food bowls from Chinese restaurants.

269
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:49,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But then every month, they rotate in themes.

270
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So last month we had playing cards.

271
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,945
[SPEAKER_05]: The month before I think we had Easter eggs because it was April.

272
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So June we have cheese.

273
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:59,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's really cute, y'all ready for this?

274
00:21:59,106 --> 00:21:59,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all ready for this?

275
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:04,508
[SPEAKER_05]: What's really cute is that like, so the blue Pikmin gets blue cheese.

276
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:07,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The white Pikmin I think gets white cheddar.

277
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:13,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So they actually get like cheese that kind of matches their color or personality.

278
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it's funny, but it is.

279
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me.

280
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,291
[SPEAKER_01]: And all together they stink.

281
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:18,631
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

282
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:22,146
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cool.

283
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:27,329
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another remaster that's coming to the Nintendo Switch.

284
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:30,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.

285
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:38,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out with they have 80 playable levels and two player co-op, including, I believe, the ones from the 3DS as well.

286
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:39,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're adding that in there.

287
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out January 16th.

288
00:22:43,440 --> 00:23:01,672
[SPEAKER_04]: um we got confirmation of Dragon Quest 3 uh HD 2D remake so done in that kind of Octopath Traveler style which looks awesome and that's coming November 14th and then along with that Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are also getting similar remasters but those are coming out next year

289
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:03,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for those.

290
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:06,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That looked really good, the Dragon Quest.

291
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:13,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this trend, and I've said this before, of the remakes in the Octopath Traveler engine because they've been getting a lot of mileage out of that engine.

292
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:16,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they call it internally, but it's very obvious.

293
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:28,460
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Triangle Strategy, we had Octopath 2, we had Live Alive, and all these games have been remade in that engine.

294
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dragon Quest coming out is great news.

295
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:34,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just get the Final Fantasy games remade in that.

296
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,449
[SPEAKER_04]: How about fucking Chrono Trigger?

297
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:37,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that.

298
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll take that too.

299
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

300
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another trailer for Funko Fusion, a game I keep forgetting that's out.

301
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:46,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

302
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Lego Dimensions looking, I guess.

303
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's neat they got all the licenses.

304
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:53,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say that.

305
00:23:53,514 --> 00:23:54,314
[SPEAKER_04]: It licenses the game.

306
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I said a nice thing.

307
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:57,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so...

308
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:23,222
[SPEAKER_04]: another remake, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD that's gonna be coming out here I think this year New Dempa Man is getting a Switch version on July 22nd it's a free title Metal Slug Attack Reloaded that is like a tower defense Metal Slug game I

309
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:28,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Jamie's going to take issue with what I'm about to say, but please forgive me.

310
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe Metal Slug is still a thing.

311
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:37,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should it not still be a thing?

312
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:38,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

313
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:42,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little shocked that it's still a thing.

314
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:47,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't fucking get Mother 3 to save our lives, but here comes a new Metal Slug game.

315
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Running guns are great.

316
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:55,421
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about Metal Slug is it's easy to just pick it up and play it until you're done getting killed.

317
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:56,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's like the Saw movies.

318
00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:58,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying it's bad.

319
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying I'm just a little surprised it's still going.

320
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:03,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And it requires a little emotional investment.

321
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But they haven't really done run-and-gun versions of the game recently.

322
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had a tactics game, and then they have this now that is a tower defense game, which is cool that they're doing spinoffs, but... Ah, very good insight from QuestBuster in chat, who says, This Metal Slug used to be a gacha game.

323
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being re-released without the gacha.

324
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you love to see it.

325
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:26,867
[SPEAKER_05]: The de-gacha-ing of games that get released.

326
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You love to see that.

327
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:32,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish that mobile game would get a Switch release.

328
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,110
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been like, what was the one?

329
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:36,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it had a cult following.

330
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:37,853
[SPEAKER_05]: People loved it.

331
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:40,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo pulled the plug on it not that long ago.

332
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:41,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an original IP.

333
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:43,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

334
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:44,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I remember?

335
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in chat has to know what I'm talking about.

336
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a Dragalia Lost.

337
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:48,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

338
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:49,144
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

339
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:49,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragalia Lost.

340
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:55,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of shocked there hasn't been a like port of that de-gotcha'd for Switch.

341
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:56,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

342
00:25:58,781 --> 00:25:59,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Darkest Dungeon 2

343
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:23,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're getting some Game Boy Advance titles, Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Metroid Zero Mission.

344
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:23,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

345
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Great release, finally.

346
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:27,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great one.

347
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:32,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Turok, Dinosaur Hunter, and Perfect Dark.

348
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear there's some issues with the emulation in those games, but hopefully Nintendo fixes it fast.

349
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,376
[SPEAKER_05]: we had Phantom Brave Lost Hero do you know how horny people are for a new Phantom Brave game?

350
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: do you know how horny people are for that?

351
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:59,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it was popular I didn't know how underground popular it really is but people are very excited about that game let me tell you we had a

352
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection

353
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:39,230
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first sign that maybe, just between this and Street Fighter VI, maybe, just maybe, Capcom vs. SNK, Capcom vs. SNK 2, and then SNK vs. Capcom can all be in a collection someday.

354
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

355
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:42,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

356
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Party.

357
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:45,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, Nintendo.

358
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:46,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamboree.

359
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So, more minigames.

360
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:49,436
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out October 17th.

361
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:52,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

362
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:17,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do what I do.

363
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't play them.

364
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't, actually.

365
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:34,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also understand to an extent that Nintendo is probably quote-unquote buying time because the Nintendo Switch 2 was probably supposed to be on their original plan, the big holiday thing that they were going to be talking about right now.

366
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:38,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really view this Mario Party thing as a time filler.

367
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:42,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, I guess, its place right now.

368
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,831
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what it is.

369
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:50,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you're muted at one point.

370
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,633
[SPEAKER_04]: The traditional Zelda games.

371
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:25,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now we're kind of moving into that whole new Zelda type territory.

372
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have a problem putting a sword in that woman's hand?

373
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of agree with that, actually.

374
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:39,499
[SPEAKER_05]: My biggest concern is that I just don't love the system of making a table.

375
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:43,960
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also trying to give it the benefit of the doubt.

376
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play it to sort of see because I think what they're trying to do...

377
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:53,602
[SPEAKER_05]: is that Nintendo's had a lot of success with the recent 3D, you know, Breath of the Wild, et cetera, with that open world concept.

378
00:29:53,682 --> 00:30:01,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is them trying to do the open world in a, I'm going to use my quotey fingers, 2D Zelda game, because at its core, it's a 2D Zelda game.

379
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:16,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm kind of giving the benefit of the doubt that maybe it doesn't seem as weird as it did in that trailer, that maybe the combat will be a little better than throwing tables at people and having, you know, familiars that you summon that do the work for you.

380
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:18,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Link's Awakening

381
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:38,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it looks like an interesting game.

382
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,153
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a fun game.

383
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:42,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play it, but it's not what I wanted for a game featuring Zelda.

384
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:43,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

385
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:45,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm laughing at what Miramuse said in chat.

386
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Duplicate a new boyfriend and peace out.

387
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:52,035
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

388
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:10,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Link's Awakening

389
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:29,814
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

390
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:51,769
[SPEAKER_05]: for better or for worse.

391
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:58,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this was probably the smartest thing Nintendo could do in the type of situation they're in.

392
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:05,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I still wish they'd just give the woman a sword too, yes, but I'm curious.

393
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:07,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very, very curious how it's going to play out.

394
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

395
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:19,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And at least it's not a 3DO Zelda game, because Zelda has been the star of a Zelda game before, but we're not going to talk about the 3DO anymore.

396
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:49,422
[SPEAKER_05]: and then of course Just Dance 2025 who cares it better still have Rasputin in it well it's all selling their track pack's selling the online mode now I think I maybe recognized one song in that trailer that they had but I did laugh when it came up I did laugh and I said you know just again I know it was probably the world's safest prediction to make but I did laugh I was like of course of course it's in Nintendo Direct yeah

397
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:54,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another trailer for LEGO Horizon Adventure showing off the Switch version.

398
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming this holiday as well.

399
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:02,649
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the announcement that Stray is being ported to the Nintendo Switch.

400
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:03,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

401
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:05,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

402
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, Dartistry is correcting me and saying it was a CDI game.

403
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:16,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at this point, 3DO, CDI all live in that realm of shit that was too expensive when I was a kid and didn't really have any good games on them anyway.

404
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:17,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but thank you.

405
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I should get that correct.

406
00:33:19,152 --> 00:33:19,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

407
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,143
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a brand new Hobbit game called Tales of the Shire.

408
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,145
[SPEAKER_01]: It is... Animal Crossing for Hobbits?

409
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:29,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably, yeah.

410
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:30,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like that.

411
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:36,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I'm hating on franchises, why don't I just say I don't care about The Hobbit as a franchise.

412
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not care about The Hobbit.

413
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm special.

414
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:39,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, she's different.

415
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:43,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to say it, like every time a trailer... I'm like, who's buying these games?

416
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not me and it's not anybody I know.

417
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:46,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob?

418
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you buying these games?

419
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:48,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no.

420
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:51,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to say, I don't care about the Hobbit titles either.

421
00:33:52,548 --> 00:34:05,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I only really have cared about the books, and the books, honestly enough, if it was Tolkien describing the scenery, he'd spend three fucking pages on it, and then one page of fighting, and that's it.

422
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:36,159
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and to even even the Lord of the Rings fanboys would be upset when it comes to the video games because does anybody remember the Gollum game we were just talking about about a year ago anyone remember how that turned out so anyway sorry I just yeah that was that was very much a get a snack and water break when they were showing that game Gollum just as a name makes me think of like a bad excuse uh for like six I'm sorry I can't go out tonight I've got the Gollum

423
00:34:41,772 --> 00:34:43,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I'm doing that with a British accent either.

424
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why either, but it adds so much to it.

425
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:55,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what, I have been playing Dead by Daylight with Shayla and her Scottish boyfriend, Ryan, who is amazing.

426
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just so sorry.

427
00:34:57,322 --> 00:35:00,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to send my regrets because I've come down with a case of the golem.

428
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:03,125
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a tragedy, really.

429
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:07,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the golem and they're out of golemite, so... Alas.

430
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:08,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Alas.

431
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:34,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I shall retire with my new pet, Gustarian Honk I may have been watching some Baldur's Gate stuff Okay, stop making this game sound cool Next Oh, we can make it cool with voices Next we have Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Much cooler That one's got stuff that never came out in the US Mm-hmm

432
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:43,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then what's cool about it though is they've also remastered it and they still have the original graphics as well in case you don't want the remastered graphics.

433
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:45,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

434
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:50,814
[SPEAKER_04]: The 100 line Last Defense Academy.

435
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:52,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

436
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:56,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this must have been something I skipped past in the trailers when I was watching.

437
00:35:58,816 --> 00:35:59,136
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

438
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:02,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven.

439
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:05,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be coming out as well very soon.

440
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:14,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last but not least, we finally got a look at Metroid Prime 4, now titled Metroid Prime 4 Beyond.

441
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,679
[SPEAKER_04]: This is totally a Switch 2 game.

442
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,300
[SPEAKER_05]: A look?

443
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a 25-cent peekaboo that we got at that game.

444
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,221
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, now with more motion sickness.

445
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:23,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Ta-da!

446
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:30,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That was... That looks like a Switch 2 game, being that it's coming out sometime in 2025.

447
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason they didn't show much.

448
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:55,956
[SPEAKER_05]: they've got much more to show like and again I'm trying very careful not to get the hype train going too much but look we all know a Switch 2 is coming in 2025 like the world's worst kept secret and then you know that means that Metroid Prime 4 would make a really good candidate for a you know multi-platform release title so I really feel like they were holding back with that trailer but it is nice to see

449
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:57,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real.

450
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,481
[SPEAKER_05]: After all this time, right?

451
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:01,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yes, this is actually happening.

452
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:03,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, gird your loins.

453
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:05,746
[SPEAKER_05]: A Metroid Prime 4 is actually happening.

454
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:07,767
[SPEAKER_05]: We even gave it a subtitle.

455
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:08,708
[SPEAKER_05]: We're that serious.

456
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,011
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

457
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:14,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Nintendo Direct.

458
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did you think overall of the Nintendo Direct?

459
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:17,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a direct.

460
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:19,557
[SPEAKER_01]: It did things.

461
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:19,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

462
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,218
[SPEAKER_01]: There were things shown.

463
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:24,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

464
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have some emotions.

465
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:26,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

466
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,740
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

467
00:37:52,116 --> 00:38:20,972
[SPEAKER_05]: but I was kind of like okay yeah like they're doing what they need to do to get through this holiday like a new Zelda game and Mario Party whatever even if I don't care you know somebody does and some of these other you know in the third party so that like they're showing the things they need to show to make people still care about Switch and still sell these Switches through this holiday I think they did what they needed to do so I think it was good on that reason like is it the best direct they've ever done I don't think so but it's it was a very good gap year direct

468
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:27,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, DarkTC in chat says, there was a lot I was happy with and stuff I did not expect.

469
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:31,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, congrats to the free MVC2 folks for getting what they wanted.

470
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:40,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I feel like a lot of, like, you know, between the MVC2, a new Phantom Brave, the Ace Attorney localization, like, I feel like...

471
00:38:41,916 --> 00:39:02,416
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of little like underground things finally got that release people have been waiting well I don't know if Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really underground but you know what I mean like things that are that have not been at the forefront of gamer memories or sometimes are getting all these releases that are making people very happy except for you mother 3 you can choke apparently that's that was a Nintendo quote not me

472
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:07,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Bobby Blackwell points out no F-Zero GX remaster.

473
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:19,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because, Bobby, whenever you see F-Zero GX on a leaked sheet, my uncle works at Nintendo, leaked document, whenever you see F-Zero GX, you know it's not happening.

474
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:20,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not happening.

475
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:26,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Nintendo says you'll take an F-Zero track in Mario Kart and you'll like it.

476
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Now shut up.

477
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:30,576
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we're at with that.

478
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:33,108
[SPEAKER_04]: We gave you a new F-Zero game, remember?

479
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,969
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero 99 or whatever the thing was.

480
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:45,014
[SPEAKER_05]: There was F-Zero 9, you're right, we had that, and then we had that, we had a reference in Nintendo Land, or whatever, I don't even remember what the Wii U launch game was called.

481
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:46,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Nintendo Land?

482
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:47,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it was Nintendo Land.

483
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:54,338
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a whisper of F-Zero, there was a hint, there was a breath of F-Zero content in that game as well.

484
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,000
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, and now we're gonna make four more Pikmin games.

485
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:07,912
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Ranmari in chat with an excellent point too, to be quite honest, saying Nintendo hypothetically releases a new F-Zero that isn't a remaster and everyone complains it's not as good as GX.

486
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that is what they're worried of.

487
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:13,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a legit concern.

488
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:16,194
[SPEAKER_05]: F-Zero GX can be a very hard thing to top.

489
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:22,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe their hardware can't achieve the frame rate that's required for...

490
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:26,339
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

491
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:48,827
[SPEAKER_01]: It was alright.

492
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:50,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a little bit of Baldur's Gate 3.

493
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:58,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I played, of course, mostly Dead by Daylight because of the anniversary event going on.

494
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to work my way through the tome.

495
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually really play anything other than those two and that stupid RuPaul game that I need to stop playing but I've really been putting my focus on Dead by Daylight just to get through the anniversary stuff because you know me I have to have all the cosmetics all of them I saw they released an outfit for the pig and I thought although I think that's just one that's just give me your money

496
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:31,594
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

497
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:59,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is, but I'm not going to go into like hyper detail about it.

498
00:41:59,257 --> 00:42:23,173
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that one of the hobbies that I am very deeply involved in that makes me very happy, the person that runs the facility is very passive aggressive, like super passive aggressive and likes to talk down at the adult class or basically anybody.

499
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:25,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to throw this out there.

500
00:42:26,896 --> 00:42:34,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Telling a bunch of adults to put away their phones because it sets a good example for the children doesn't mean that we have to put away our phones.

501
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:37,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And my response to that was, what phone?

502
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:42,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Not one of us had our phones out.

503
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:48,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, when you have a parent in the group, no, parent has to have their phone on them if they've got kids.

504
00:42:48,572 --> 00:42:50,794
[SPEAKER_01]: End of story.

505
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:53,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting to the point where

506
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:55,738
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

507
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:58,079
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I still enjoy... Okay, it's ballet.

508
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I still enjoy dancing.

509
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:03,082
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm getting to the point where I don't want to do the big productions.

510
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:09,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, though, that it's really annoying when somebody comes out, especially in that tone.

511
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:10,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And y'all know that tone.

512
00:43:10,386 --> 00:43:12,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that passive-aggressive tone.

513
00:43:12,227 --> 00:43:17,490
[SPEAKER_05]: They tell everybody, you need to follow this rule, and literally nobody is breaking the rule currently in the room.

514
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they know.

515
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:19,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

516
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:21,152
[SPEAKER_05]: That annoys me, too.

517
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:21,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, a lot.

518
00:43:21,993 --> 00:43:22,793
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some other stuff.

519
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:23,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

520
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: it's very unprofessional and there's a bunch of other stuff going on that is sort of coming to a head with me anyway but there's a much better way in that situation you can say that like I understand sometimes you have to go but there's what you could say oh and thank you I see nobody has your phones nobody has their phones out thank you so much for respecting what we would either there's other ways you could do it this was to be petty passive aggressive yeah this was to be petty yeah it was obvious silly so

521
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on.

522
00:43:56,179 --> 00:44:00,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a throwback to the FUs of the week, by the way, for those following with the at-home game.

523
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:02,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

524
00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:06,023
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was mostly just playing Minecraft.

525
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:11,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just getting ready for the one-chunk challenge judging today, which we did and shot.

526
00:44:12,046 --> 00:44:15,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, it was pretty much the whole week doing that.

527
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and downloading games that I'll probably never get to, like the one behind me.

528
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So the YouTube is not out for that, what you were doing today yet.

529
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:24,821
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming.

530
00:44:25,201 --> 00:44:25,781
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yet.

531
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to edit a lot of stuff.

532
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:29,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I understand.

533
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:30,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.

534
00:44:30,644 --> 00:44:30,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

535
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:32,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

536
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:34,206
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

537
00:44:34,306 --> 00:44:38,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's been a lot of the similar stuff that I've been playing recently.

538
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:40,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Still going in Final Fantasy XIV.

539
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:42,330
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Dawn Trail's out on Friday.

540
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the time we have our show next week, I will have a new Final Fantasy XIV expansion to consume.

541
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:47,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

542
00:44:47,612 --> 00:44:49,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got another class to 90.

543
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:54,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So every single class except for Warrior is now level 90.

544
00:44:54,576 --> 00:45:00,999
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if I'll get Warrior to 90 in time because I really only have until... I think the game goes down on Wednesday.

545
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:08,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really only have tomorrow and Tuesday and tonight, I guess, to try to get Warrior to 90 really fast, which I probably...

546
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:13,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be able to do if I'm willing to just chain run dungeons over and over, but it's going to be a tall order.

547
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:24,559
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see if I make it or not, but very happy that Dawn Trail's on its way out because there's going to be a lot more to do on Final Fantasy XIV.

548
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:25,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see...

549
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:54,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have been playing, I even played a little bit of Dead by Daylight I'm not as up on that game as I used to be But I was like, okay, I should sign in and cash in all these blood point codes And get some of these cakes on some of my characters I'm talking about the anniversary cakes that give you additional blood points in a match I'm not talking about a fluffy butt or anything like that Even if I do play as Chris Redfield And Carlos, I kind of go back and forth between Chris and Carlos

550
00:45:55,977 --> 00:45:56,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's see.

551
00:45:56,517 --> 00:45:57,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the same character.

552
00:45:57,558 --> 00:45:59,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, they're all Leon, basically.

553
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I don't play Leon, really.

554
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I would, I should buy that Leon skin that looks like the Roaring Twenties.

555
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:07,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the Resident Evil franchise.

556
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:08,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the noir.

557
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:08,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

558
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:09,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The noir outfit.

559
00:46:09,888 --> 00:46:12,691
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of his special outfits.

560
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

561
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:14,392
[SPEAKER_05]: In the game.

562
00:46:14,592 --> 00:46:17,214
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had that outfit, I'd probably play as Leon more often.

563
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um...

564
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:40,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I just go back and forth between all three of them but pretty much most of my points have been spent on them and then Cheryl because not only do I play as Cheryl I play as Lisa and I play as I don't know why but I play as James I don't know why I bought that skin but I did it's like one of those like why did I do that but um you know whatever um well you know I'm still a Meg Mane really I'm sorry to hear that no I'm just kidding

565
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:47,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been trying to spread out my cakes because, you know, I collect all the anniversary and event stuff.

566
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:47,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

567
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have either two or four of them because of my mental problems.

568
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:55,092
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got some stuff on Vecna now and I'm about ready to adapt them.

569
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have 70, like, year seven cakes on Chris.

570
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:05,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of these days I just need to play with you and bring all my cakes and get some blood points.

571
00:47:06,974 --> 00:47:10,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 4 Diablo 5 Diablo 6 Diablo 7

572
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,459
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

573
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:55,727
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

574
00:48:19,178 --> 00:48:46,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf will be hosting some of the, which I believe Sunday's the first day, and Bobby Blackwolf's gonna have some of the first games that are run, including Mega Man 9, Ratchet & Clank, and Splatoon 3 are the games that are being speedrun, and then he's also gonna be hosting some games on Monday, which is, oh no, I guess those Sunday games go into Monday, depending on the time, but then the games he's doing on Tuesday are Like a Dragon Gaiden,

575
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,660
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

576
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,823
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

577
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the name of charity, I'll allow it.

578
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:25,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that these charity marathons are a lot of fun.

579
00:49:25,945 --> 00:49:27,146
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, go check out Bobby.

580
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,687
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, again, the speed runners are the real stars of the show.

581
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And even Bobby would be the first to admit that.

582
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bobby will be there and you will hear his voice on stream, reading donations and all that good stuff.

583
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:38,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I am also told...

584
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

585
00:49:57,446 --> 00:50:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: including a panel room a room where people practice their speed runs and play console games a room where they have arcade games set up there are lots of things happening at Summer Games Done Quick outside of what you just see on stream so Jason is there to help some of the rest of that all happen so that's pretty cool so I didn't I didn't realize VOG Network was so involved with this uh none of us here at OLR are maybe we should be I don't know but no it's it's it's neat that uh

586
00:50:23,122 --> 00:50:23,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

587
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a big investment, too, because they've got to go out to Minneapolis, I think it's at, for several days.

588
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby's going to be there several days.

589
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he's there the entire week.

590
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:34,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, maybe he is.

591
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he did say Sunday to Sunday.

592
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:37,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a long trip.

593
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,514
[SPEAKER_05]: He's there the entire time.

594
00:50:39,654 --> 00:50:40,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

595
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:41,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

596
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:43,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight nights in a hotel.

597
00:50:43,857 --> 00:50:46,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, somebody's going to hit their reward status.

598
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:49,554
[SPEAKER_05]: from Summer Game Stunt Quick.

599
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:54,881
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on and get into some gaming news and what else is going on in the industry this week.

600
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:56,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we will start with you.

601
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:05,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so we've got basically news that Sony's not going to be at Gamescom, which kind of makes sense if you think about it because...

602
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:15,837
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if there's not a whole lot to show this year, maybe they're, I don't know if they're working on another platform already, but Why doesn't Sony have as much to show?

603
00:51:16,598 --> 00:51:17,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's just weird to me.

604
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:18,599
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and I get it.

605
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:19,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm not questioning.

606
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:24,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I too have seen, Sony's in a weird place, I feel like.

607
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:25,622
[SPEAKER_05]: This is very weird.

608
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:54,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, well maybe it's more of a thing that they just want their own event or something, maybe it's just not going to be at Gamescom but yeah, so they're not showcasing anything upcoming at Gamescom 2024, which is confirmed by Eurogamer also, Nintendo's not going to be at Gamescom either, so I don't know, Xbox is I mean, I guess you know, I mean Nintendo I still feel like has more

609
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:59,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming down the pipeline after their recent direct than Sony does right now.

610
00:52:00,074 --> 00:52:02,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's just perspective of the things I'm into.

611
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I can admit that.

612
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:07,419
[SPEAKER_01]: It could just be that, I mean, well, Nintendo doesn't necessarily have any reason to.

613
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:09,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sony's like, well, I'm going to be cool at Nintendo.

614
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:15,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's weird, though, because, like, Sony's, like, some of the stuff that they revealed were only, like, quarter three stuff.

615
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like, you know, you had...

616
00:52:18,527 --> 00:52:27,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Concord, which is August 23rd, Astrobot, which is September 6th, and the God of War Ragnarok PC port, which is September 17th.

617
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think they're sitting on holiday announcements they've yet to reveal?

618
00:52:32,946 --> 00:52:33,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, maybe?

619
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:34,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could.

620
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:37,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Sony do an August thing one year?

621
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And they put all their holiday stuff in the August announcement?

622
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:45,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see, yeah, August or Tokyo Game Show maybe, which would be early September to announce.

623
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:49,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of early for, or late for some of that stuff.

624
00:52:49,855 --> 00:52:50,856
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

625
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:58,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Switch showed you don't need as extensive of a hype train for these types of things.

626
00:52:58,588 --> 00:53:00,249
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, word travels fast, right?

627
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

628
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:07,713
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't really have anything big for holiday unless there's another Spider-Man game coming or something like that.

629
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:08,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

630
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:09,314
Hmm.

631
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:12,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it just feels weird.

632
00:53:12,973 --> 00:53:13,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Something feels off.

633
00:53:13,975 --> 00:53:18,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how else to put it that makes sense, but something just feels off.

634
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:25,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just as simple as Sony will announce more in August, and then it will feel better, I guess, but just something feels really off with Sony.

635
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:27,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well...

636
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:55,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll just wait and see well unfortunately we know this studio has been off for some time and it's the Embracer Group and boy oh boy a series of bad business decisions has led to yet another studio being closed Embracer Group CEO had originally said last month that oh the restructuring efforts and all that have ended and guess what he lied

637
00:53:56,525 --> 00:54:05,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, because this last week, Embracer closed Pieces Interactive.

638
00:54:05,736 --> 00:54:10,781
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the remake to Alone in the Dark, which, you know, I'll admit...

639
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:17,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I really could care less about an Alone in the Dark remake, and I'm not sure why this was the game that had to be remade.

640
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:29,678
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also sort of fault Lars Wingfors, who is the Embracer Group CEO, who has the final say on what gets greenlit and what doesn't for this game ever being made in the first place.

641
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:39,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And so even if the game did not perform to expectations or whatever, again, to what extent does that fall on the CEO and the board?

642
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:43,851
[SPEAKER_05]: but unfortunately it is the studio that will now suffer.

643
00:54:44,372 --> 00:54:47,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Pisces Interactive confirming its closure on its own website.

644
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:50,457
[SPEAKER_05]: The studio originally founded in 2007.

645
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:52,799
[SPEAKER_05]: They made over 10 games.

646
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:56,722
[SPEAKER_05]: They worked with THQ on an expansion for Titan Quest.

647
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:04,307
[SPEAKER_05]: They did another Titan Quest expansion under Embracer and then they did the remake of Alone in the Dark which launched in March.

648
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:07,549
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently the game did not do well.

649
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:21,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Embracer's report on the 2024 fiscal year said Alone in the Dark saw a positive reception from users but a mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.

650
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Well then maybe management needs to be learning how to set their expectations more appropriately.

651
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:53,895
[SPEAKER_04]: but um you know they're never going to take accountability because they never do in this country anyway and what they expect from low in the dark or even you're actually an embracer i'm sorry embracer is europe and so you know or over there so yeah like i don't know what they expected with this game anyways i mean like yeah david harbour is you know it he's a great actor but like that's not gonna draw people to the game necessarily and alone dark such a

652
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:58,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Old franchise that probably no one knows about anymore.

653
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:02,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a period piece type of game.

654
00:56:02,655 --> 00:56:05,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very niche.

655
00:56:05,918 --> 00:56:08,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's solid AA territory there.

656
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're charging $60 for it, which I think is too high.

657
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:16,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe $50, $40, probably better.

658
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,928
[SPEAKER_04]: But they really need to scale it down.

659
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:22,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, it's just not...

660
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:27,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Not gonna sell a ton because people don't know what it is.

661
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:29,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Resident Evil.

662
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:36,246
[SPEAKER_05]: CEOs everywhere are having a really rude awakening on what gamers are willing to pay $60 or $70 for.

663
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:49,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has been a problem for years, obviously, but this is really starting to come to a head that we're seeing with all these layoffs and this disappointing expectations and all this stuff is that there really is only so much you can get away with charging $70 for.

664
00:56:51,414 --> 00:57:07,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were geniuses that's why they're paid like billions of dollars or millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars 300 times more than their regular employees they create business deals that fucking incinerate overnight and go nowhere and then the entire rest of the company suffers

665
00:57:09,451 --> 00:57:10,052
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

666
00:57:25,952 --> 00:57:28,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, and I'm actually really pleased to see this.

667
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:42,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So FromSoftware's president, Miyazaki Hidetaka, was basically putting out that he's not going to let the same sorts of shutdowns and layoffs happen.

668
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this is the studio that did Elden Rings and Dark Souls games and stuff like that.

669
00:57:50,191 --> 00:58:18,739
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's it's been you know a rough ride I think for every company but one of the things that he was going on in fact I'll just read the quote speaking to myself in this company I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at From Software in a million years I'm pretty sure our parent company Kadokawa understands that and shares that view Kadokawa by the way is a publishing company is very very prolific

670
00:58:22,058 --> 00:58:41,248
[SPEAKER_01]: but the company has actually been growing during all this time since working on Elden Ring they've got the Armored Core 6, Elden Ring just had a huge DLC comes out but Miyazaki actually brings up Iwata talking about the layoffs

671
00:58:42,529 --> 00:58:43,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read the quote again.

672
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:51,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the old ex-president of Nintendo, Iwata-san, who said that people who are afraid of losing their jobs are afraid of making good things.

673
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:54,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paraphrasing that, but I totally share this view.

674
00:58:55,182 --> 00:58:58,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the people at Kadokawa, our parent company, understand that.

675
00:58:58,245 --> 00:58:59,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I hold this view very strongly.

676
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:13,938
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying that they don't know 100% for sure what's going to happen, but his vow is to keep his employees' jobs safe so that they can continue working at their best.

677
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: What a difference in perspective though, you know, and especially, you know, invoking Iwata and just what a hugely respected businessman in the industry he was.

678
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:33,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, Ranmari in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network reminding us, you know, when Nintendo was going through financial roughness, Iwata cut his own salary.

679
00:59:34,023 --> 00:59:34,443
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

680
00:59:34,823 --> 00:59:39,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's always that standard, you know, when the Wii U was struggling, that is 100% true, that happened.

681
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why a lot of us...

682
00:59:42,745 --> 01:00:06,091
[SPEAKER_05]: that's how it should be and when we look at a lot of these other CEOs out there who don't do the same thing or the disgusting pig Bobby Kotick getting a huge payout to leave Activision as a fucking reward to be quite honest it's disgusting it's disgusting and you wonder why people don't want to pay $70 for a game who's pocketing that money

683
01:00:07,489 --> 01:00:10,051
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

684
01:00:26,562 --> 01:00:51,808
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's like no you you you have to like if a person is always afraid of their job being on the line they're not going to take creative risks and creative risks are where the greatest games come from right you know and FromSoftware is in a great place right now happy Elden Ring expansion week to those who celebrate including my husband who you know got got got on that bandwagon this week so there's a lot of people really excited about that Elden Ring expansion

685
01:00:52,267 --> 01:01:02,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put this out, and I believe this, and it's kind of a tenet where I work, that without innovation, you have stagnation.

686
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:10,433
[SPEAKER_01]: When nothing changes, nothing gets better, and if you don't change to adapt to what's around you, then you're going to fail.

687
01:01:11,554 --> 01:01:15,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes, you have to be the one to affect the change.

688
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:21,029
[SPEAKER_01]: which again, innovate, change the narrative, bring out something new.

689
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:23,476
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to reinvent the wheel to innovate on it.

690
01:01:25,063 --> 01:01:50,169
[SPEAKER_05]: so by the way when we're talking about $70 games and some perspective here that Elden Ring Shadow of the Erd Tree DLC is $40 now that is on the high end of DLC costs but everything I'm hearing about it is that it is basically like an like it's it's basically a full game like it is like like it's not just like DLC like ooh bonus chapter or bonus it is like another fucking game within Elden Ring

691
01:01:50,789 --> 01:02:13,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when we got the Citadel DLC back in the day, it was like adding a whole extra part to the game Yeah, but even more than that from what I understand this is Like an MMO expansion, I think may be a really good way, like a Wrath of the Lich King or Endwalker type of situation, sounds like that Yeah

692
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,933
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

693
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:26,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe now, even though we show a little love to the Japanese companies here, maybe there are other decisions that don't always make sense.

694
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:26,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Loki?

695
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:36,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Nintendo is coming after people again for IP theft or whatever.

696
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:43,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But this time, now they're actually coming after YouTube channels that have created sheet music of Nintendo tracks.

697
01:02:43,751 --> 01:02:55,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sheet Music Boss and Purple Shala have been informed by their respective community that Nintendo has begun targeting sheet music sites like Music Notes and TakingMusicDown.com

698
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:58,996
[SPEAKER_04]: for games like Pokemon Mario and The Legend of Zelda.

699
01:02:59,996 --> 01:03:04,738
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that Music Notes is actively trying to get this decision reversed.

700
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:12,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Sheet Music Boss says their arrangements have been correctly licensed and that the original artists were receiving royalties for their sheet music.

701
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:19,982
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on it, but it's super frustrating, especially given that so many Nintendo pieces aren't available anywhere as sheets.

702
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:24,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for anyone that's affected, but please know it's totally out of our control.

703
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:43,105
[SPEAKER_01]: it depends on how the composer of the music was contracted to do it but with a lot of cases any sort of art or asset that is produced while under the employ of another company is the property of the company um

704
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:51,966
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of a contractor, it would have to be something in their class.

705
01:03:52,026 --> 01:03:59,373
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to say go work for Sega and do a logo for them, that logo doesn't belong to me even though it's my work.

706
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:02,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put it in my portfolio, but Sega would own that work.

707
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:11,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think there's a lot of cooks in the kitchens of this stuff, too, because I'm sure Nintendo doesn't handle a lot of this stuff internally.

708
01:04:11,366 --> 01:04:16,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably contract with somebody else to handle all the music licensing stuff, and that's who these companies are kind of claiming to go through.

709
01:04:18,352 --> 01:04:21,655
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, all that stuff aside, it's just not a good look.

710
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:23,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not a good look.

711
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:24,477
[SPEAKER_05]: But do they care?

712
01:04:24,957 --> 01:04:25,758
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't.

713
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those things where you go, were they legally within their right?

714
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, the question I would really ask, and surely somebody's asked this question.

715
01:04:32,844 --> 01:04:33,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely.

716
01:04:33,224 --> 01:04:33,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the first.

717
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:36,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it actually Nintendo that did the cease and desist?

718
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we know that that shit has been happening on YouTube.

719
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:43,230
[SPEAKER_05]: That people that aren't actually the companies have been putting out claims.

720
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,792
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole other like seedy shit thing that's going on YouTube.

721
01:04:47,132 --> 01:04:53,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But like that would be the first question I would ask is are we sure it was actually Nintendo that sent this?

722
01:04:53,896 --> 01:04:59,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Or their authorized license grant or whatever it's called legally.

723
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:00,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Their solicitor.

724
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,001
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a solicitor.

725
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:02,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

726
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:05,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it really from them?

727
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:07,116
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first question I would honestly ask.

728
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:16,602
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it was, then it just seems desperate for a company that doesn't need to be desperate.

729
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

730
01:05:18,264 --> 01:05:23,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if my little symphony wants to play music from Fire Emblem...

731
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:26,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have to pay for the license?

732
01:05:49,548 --> 01:06:01,617
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one thing but I'm wondering if I haven't used these sites I mean I might have peeked at one to get an idea for doing a MIDI track once but it depends on if

733
01:06:03,152 --> 01:06:09,833
[SPEAKER_01]: These sites let independent users also upload their own versions of things.

734
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,734
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, it would be unlicensed media.

735
01:06:13,754 --> 01:06:17,234
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of weirdness that goes on with those kind of legalities.

736
01:06:17,414 --> 01:06:18,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not lawyers.

737
01:06:18,715 --> 01:06:19,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Disclaimer, disclaimer.

738
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:31,917
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm wondering if there are other circumstances that we coming into this are not seeing.

739
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:34,649
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't have to give us the full story.

740
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:39,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times information is put out there for our consumption so that we'll consume it in a particular manner.

741
01:06:40,294 --> 01:06:40,835
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

742
01:06:41,555 --> 01:06:43,958
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not watching Untucked, you're only getting half the story.

743
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:50,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's like a legit comparison here.

744
01:06:50,413 --> 01:06:51,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you're right.

745
01:06:51,293 --> 01:06:56,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there is part of the story we don't see, which is often the case in these types of situations.

746
01:06:57,376 --> 01:07:08,960
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this comes back to an adage that I've put out there on the show before about in gaming, what is often the truth doesn't matter.

747
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that's a very tough pill to swallow, but the truth doesn't matter.

748
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: What is perceived is always going to be the thing that drives gamers.

749
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:20,305
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the time.

750
01:07:21,185 --> 01:07:22,205
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do with anybody.

751
01:07:22,526 --> 01:07:24,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's going to make their own judgments.

752
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly enough, it's what I think a lot of news outlets rely on.

753
01:07:34,011 --> 01:07:34,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

754
01:07:35,772 --> 01:07:41,656
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's why we have a lot of the problems we do because people do not do their own fucking research and they make a snap judgment at the end.

755
01:07:41,716 --> 01:07:42,556
[SPEAKER_01]: That's human nature.

756
01:07:43,037 --> 01:07:44,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God my brain's not wired that way.

757
01:07:45,118 --> 01:07:49,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not imagine existing in that kind of mental state.

758
01:07:50,387 --> 01:08:17,129
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end There was such a good TikTok floating around this week of Jon Stewart I mean, really, it was just a clip from The Daily Show Jon Stewart is I happened to see it on TikTok And he really nailed this whole thing about how the media just doesn't fucking hold anybody accountable, including itself Yeah Yeah I mean, even, like, I've even started losing some faith in the BBC Because they used to just be the dry British fact news

759
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:18,584
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

760
01:08:19,145 --> 01:08:21,047
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, that goes back to this, though.

761
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:22,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to talk about the weather today.

762
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:24,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be quite golem out.

763
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:30,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Golem is going to be our new thing for sickly, poorly things.

764
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um...

765
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:47,302
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I was bringing that up is that I think that we also, as people, we tend to look at the first things and give our reactions to things, but I don't know.

766
01:08:47,342 --> 01:08:54,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wonder if there is something else under the surface of this that we don't know.

767
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:57,924
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that's motivating Nintendo to do this?

768
01:08:58,324 --> 01:09:00,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're planning on publishing their sheet music themselves.

769
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:03,452
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

770
01:09:20,732 --> 01:09:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean to be fair and Bobby went over this on his show too and he said it in chat is that this particular site was paying compositional licenses to whoever that entity was so technically even if a book was coming there was that payment so it was it was legal on that end but that is that is a very interesting perspective on what could the other half of the story be right exactly exactly and that's just what I wanted to have people think about too is that

771
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:45,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Just what we see on the surface.

772
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:53,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we know fact is fact, you know, legally, they don't really have a foot to stand on unless there's something else going on here that's not obvious to us.

773
01:09:56,289 --> 01:09:56,609
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

774
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving on, you know, this this can just be a scare tactic.

775
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:06,522
[SPEAKER_05]: This is somewhat in a way in a similar wavelength of this story, even though it's about a very different topic.

776
01:10:06,562 --> 01:10:09,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is very much like what is the perception that this leaves out there?

777
01:10:10,204 --> 01:10:11,864
[SPEAKER_05]: What is going on now?

778
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:23,049
[SPEAKER_05]: This does get into rumor and alleged territory, but it is, again, one of those things where based on, you know, we are able to emotionally jump to this conclusion based on what we are seeing.

779
01:10:23,709 --> 01:10:27,912
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm talking about is the PlayStation VR 2 and what's going on there.

780
01:10:29,213 --> 01:10:32,615
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we haven't seen a lot of first-party games for the PlayStation VR 2.

781
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:36,318
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a lot of reliance on third parties and all that going on.

782
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:47,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Android Central is a website that has reported, of course, anonymous sources, that Sony has cut funding for VR game development and there are only...

783
01:10:49,206 --> 01:10:53,467
[SPEAKER_05]: There are only two projects currently in development at Sony for this.

784
01:10:54,228 --> 01:10:55,108
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what the games are.

785
01:10:55,128 --> 01:10:57,248
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no details on what those projects are.

786
01:10:57,708 --> 01:11:09,511
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does sort of say something, especially when you kind of put that next to Sony putting out that device that opens it up as a PC headset at this point and all that stuff that Sony's just kind of ready to move on.

787
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:17,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I don't know what these two games are supposed to be, if they're Hail Marys or what, but Sony's kinda done.

788
01:11:18,217 --> 01:11:19,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you look like you're dying to say something.

789
01:11:20,599 --> 01:11:38,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just saying, like, this is typical Sony, like, with any of these, like, new, like, Vita and the original PlayStation VR, although I think they support the original PlayStation VR a little bit more, but, yeah, I mean, it's just... Why create these devices if you're not gonna support them?

790
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:39,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

791
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:43,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny enough, this report came from Android Central.

792
01:11:43,853 --> 01:11:49,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Google, another perfect example of a company that creates things that they then don't support.

793
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:50,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

794
01:11:52,133 --> 01:12:00,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it should be pointed out, if you are a VR enthusiast or you're a PSVR2 owner who's frowning right now, there are things happening in the third-party space, right?

795
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Alien Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening.

796
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:09,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it's got to be disappointing to an extent to hear that Sony is kind of cutting back.

797
01:12:09,687 --> 01:12:17,594
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, again, I'd be curious what those two games are, if they're putting the weight of a AAA franchise, but, like, actually meaning it.

798
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:31,685
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a cute little Horizon, because I know the one time I played the PSVR 2 at Bobby's house, he had a Horizon minigame thing that actually was a pretty neat proof of concept for the sound all around you.

799
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:34,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It did a lot of the VR tricks very cool.

800
01:12:34,127 --> 01:12:34,727
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a neat thing.

801
01:12:35,108 --> 01:12:47,558
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't really like a start-to-finish narrative experience type of thing that I think people sort of long for in VR with the first party weight behind it.

802
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird to think that that's ever going to happen at this point.

803
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby says, I mean, I didn't put you in the start to finish experience.

804
01:13:02,163 --> 01:13:03,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I put you in the Disney ride.

805
01:13:04,224 --> 01:13:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then let me flip that around.

806
01:13:06,285 --> 01:13:14,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you believe that the full game was as good as a Horizon Forbidden West or Horizon Zero Dawn?

807
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:23,810
[SPEAKER_05]: because when I look at some of these other PSVR spinoff games, even on the one, they were a little different.

808
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Bobby says, no, I do not.

809
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:27,394
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is that.

810
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:31,428
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what did the internet find this week?

811
01:13:56,734 --> 01:13:59,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself am strange and unusual.

812
01:14:01,257 --> 01:14:05,698
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what has been thought forever lost has been found.

813
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:12,720
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a really, really bad, devious, all-CG movie that was done in 2002.

814
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:19,201
[SPEAKER_01]: It, like, had a single play, I think it was like 75 minutes, and it played during a summer roadshow.

815
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:26,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it never was released for home media, which had been planned, and it hasn't been rebroadcast since.

816
01:14:27,603 --> 01:14:30,924
[SPEAKER_01]: The trailer for it has resurfaced, you know.

817
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:56,421
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh it's uh it looked as bad as I thought it was going to look I mean the CG is definitely dated but um but it was done by Groove Corporation and apparently this is uh at least according to Lost Media Wiki the head of Groove Corporation stole the company's cash in the master tapes

818
01:14:57,795 --> 01:15:05,683
[SPEAKER_01]: and that basically led the company to go out of business and there are of course no masters to make the copies off of.

819
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:07,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

820
01:15:08,106 --> 01:15:09,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But even the trailer was really bad.

821
01:15:09,828 --> 01:15:09,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Like...

822
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it was the trailer that was released for a short run in 2002.

823
01:15:22,037 --> 01:15:24,019
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more of this.

824
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:30,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person who uploaded it to YouTube is R&D Stranger.

825
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:59,729
[SPEAKER_01]: but the quote on this is this is the trailer for the Xevious CGI animated movie that was released to Japanese theaters for only a short run in 2002 after the run was finished the movie was never released again only a clip about 5 seconds long existed online before this however I found a promotional preview CD that included trailers for several animated short films including Xevious so here is the trailer from that CD

826
01:16:01,488 --> 01:16:10,057
[SPEAKER_01]: and then something in 2020, Bandai Namco Studios had a snippet of the movie in the Namco Museum of Art series.

827
01:16:11,919 --> 01:16:15,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's it.

828
01:16:15,302 --> 01:16:15,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.

829
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:21,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that dude will turn up and say, hey, here's those tapes, by the way.

830
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:22,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know.

831
01:16:22,782 --> 01:16:28,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Or someone will find like, you know, oh, what is this master tape I found on eBay for $3?

832
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, it's a really awful Xevious movie.

833
01:16:32,072 --> 01:16:53,193
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah this is what like as much as I believe you know all art to an extent should be preserved um this isn't a hill worth dying on like this this one we can let go uh it's it's really okay if this never sees light a day uh we'll move on with our lives we really will uh because it looked really bad all right

834
01:16:54,562 --> 01:17:01,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, plus when I think about video game movies that need to be made, like Xevious, not even in the top 100, to be honest.

835
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:03,811
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

836
01:17:04,652 --> 01:17:05,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It must have been cheap to license.

837
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:06,133
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

838
01:17:06,574 --> 01:17:07,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, Loki.

839
01:17:09,256 --> 01:17:09,537
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

840
01:17:10,477 --> 01:17:15,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got some possible leaks of time splitters coming to the PlayStation platform.

841
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:25,427
[SPEAKER_04]: because in Korea, or I should say Taiwan, the ratings board has rated TimeSplitters for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

842
01:17:26,547 --> 01:17:28,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't think this is a new game.

843
01:17:28,267 --> 01:17:38,549
[SPEAKER_04]: The thought is that it's going to be the PlayStation 2 game as part of the PlayStation Plus catalog, which is less exciting, but cool, I guess.

844
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:38,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Much less exciting.

845
01:17:38,969 --> 01:17:39,729
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's coming out.

846
01:17:40,549 --> 01:17:41,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

847
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:44,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my new TimeSplitters game, please.

848
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:47,059
[SPEAKER_04]: All these promises.

849
01:17:49,661 --> 01:17:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe... I'm sure this is Embracer's fault.

850
01:17:52,222 --> 01:17:53,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we'll just blame Embracer.

851
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:54,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Great idea.

852
01:17:55,945 --> 01:18:02,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on and talk about one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.

853
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:09,733
[SPEAKER_05]: This has to do, unfortunately, with a studio that shut down, but it's an interesting sort of story about how...

854
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,215
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

855
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:28,288
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

856
01:18:50,683 --> 01:18:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

857
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:23,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So wherever he ended up, he's probably doing A-OK.

858
01:19:24,145 --> 01:19:28,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just be a question of how many of his former studio employees was he able to bring with him.

859
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:35,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully a lot, but we'll see over the next few weeks and months, really, as that news develops.

860
01:19:36,498 --> 01:19:40,642
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment.

861
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's roll the bumper.

862
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:55,572
[SPEAKER_00]: The Classic Game of the Week is Child of Light.

863
01:20:19,266 --> 01:20:29,953
[SPEAKER_01]: on purpose picked something that came out as close to the edge of that 10 year gap that I could find wait till you see what I do in November

864
01:20:32,225 --> 01:20:48,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Child of Light is a platforming RPG that was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and it was published by Ubisoft for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in April of 2014.

865
01:20:48,769 --> 01:20:56,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out on the PlayStation Vita in July 2014 and later was released on Switch on October 11, 2018.

866
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:00,673
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be going into more on this.

867
01:21:01,374 --> 01:21:03,075
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play it on all sorts of things.

868
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:05,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually available on Luna.

869
01:21:05,577 --> 01:21:06,618
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on Stadia.

870
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:09,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Stadia.

871
01:21:10,921 --> 01:21:15,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually run on the UbiArt Framework game engine.

872
01:21:15,844 --> 01:21:17,645
[SPEAKER_01]: This game is fucking beautiful, okay?

873
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:19,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look at it.

874
01:21:19,447 --> 01:21:19,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it.

875
01:21:20,567 --> 01:21:21,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It lives through her life.

876
01:21:21,768 --> 01:21:28,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And if y'all are listening elsewhere, pull over to the side of the road, pull out your YouTube app, and look at it.

877
01:21:29,775 --> 01:21:30,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

878
01:21:31,257 --> 01:21:51,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the game, it takes place in this land called Lemuria, and you play as Aurora, who is a child who wakes up after dying from an illness and has to bring back the sun, the moon, and the stars that are being held by the Queen of Night so that she can go home.

879
01:21:53,408 --> 01:22:15,909
[SPEAKER_01]: um the way that you play is it's got some definitely side scrolling platforming elements to it and it's a little flying around here a little puzzle solving there and different role play elements so you have like turn-based combat like the active uh battle systems and some of our favorite RPGs like the Final Fantasy series or Grandia

880
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:39,802
[SPEAKER_01]: you can control up to two characters during a battle and you can swap them out with waiting characters and you get up to three enemies that happen during the battle and if you approach them from behind you get a surprise strike and if they get you from behind it's an ambush and you also have a

881
01:22:41,221 --> 01:23:06,529
[SPEAKER_01]: another character called Igniculus who is a firefly and is used as a mechanic inside and during the battles I'm sorry, outside and during the battles and then you can move them around to open chests and shine light on an enemy to slow them down or to heal you just like your little supporting it's like Navi, it's your supporting Navi Hey, Houston!

882
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:31,751
[SPEAKER_01]: um without being that annoying so um but Aurora is a princess and after being stranded in Lemuria uh she runs into a uh a jester called Rubella who has a vocabulary problem and then Finn who is a sorcerer and just all kinds of fun characters so um

883
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:50,872
[SPEAKER_01]: as it stands though the game visually is just this really really pretty pretty thing the backgrounds look like watercolor paintings um or at the very least like really nice gouache um

884
01:23:52,780 --> 01:24:04,271
[SPEAKER_01]: and just it's so it makes me think honestly I don't know why but I get a vibe in the art style resembling like the little prince illustrations you know I see that

885
01:24:08,424 --> 01:24:31,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it was initially shown at GDC Europe 2013 and it was said that it was inspired by Studio Ghibli and my art hero, Yoshitaka Amano and presented those other sort of paint-like games like Limbo and

886
01:24:33,098 --> 01:24:36,620
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it's absolutely beautiful.

887
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:44,805
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted Aurora to grow throughout the game going from five years old to 10 to 15 and finish when she was around 20 years old.

888
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:50,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could see her physically evolve and then along with her personality.

889
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:55,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course all of her relationships and her perspective would change.

890
01:24:56,871 --> 01:25:21,449
[SPEAKER_01]: it would have had multiple endings where you would decide the ending that you want but she only ages once in the game and there's one ending and then now this I like is that they had talked about her having like a prince in the story but they wanted her to be someone who did not rely on a man or fall in love at the end of the story and this is real girl boss power just saying

891
01:25:24,107 --> 01:25:40,628
[SPEAKER_01]: and that oh god, something else I totally agree with the writer Jeffrey Yohalem says that love is an easy way out for a writer that instead of focusing on

892
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:56,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing up or using your time to help others or just being an adult or doing things on your own, that it's a cop-out to have them instead just be a romance story.

893
01:25:56,452 --> 01:26:00,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of good stories that are ruined by romance.

894
01:26:00,493 --> 01:26:00,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

895
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:06,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And Aurora is actually...

896
01:26:09,005 --> 01:26:18,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly from Austria, sorry, 1895, Austria, the child of a duke.

897
01:26:18,911 --> 01:26:29,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's stated that the lands are supposed to be in Carniola and that there's an earthquake that hit the capital on Easter Sunday.

898
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what was incorporated into the game.

899
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:58,417
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's like a flood going on from a dam bursting and so it's uh lots of stuff going on there's lots of stuff behind it um it's like I mentioned before it's using the UbiArt framework engine that was also used for Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends so they could uh put concept art into the game and make it look like an animated painting um

900
01:26:59,508 --> 01:27:15,038
[SPEAKER_01]: they gave it a watercolor effect because they wanted it to look like an underwater dream and that some of the staff had their kids draw Aurora based on the description that they were given and they

901
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:43,497
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, they took it that design so at any rate it's also been described as a playable poem with the game's dialogue being done in rhyme and ballad form so four line stanza with the second and fourth ending in rhyming words with some variable iambic counts so basically it's like you're listening to a sonnet every time you hear them talk um

902
01:27:45,518 --> 01:27:56,691
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the artwork was inspired by, of course, like I said earlier, Amano, also Arthur Rackman, John Bauer, Edmund Duloc.

903
01:27:59,486 --> 01:28:18,478
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was also released in Europe with an exclusive poster that came with the deluxe versions of the games for Windows, PS3 and PS4 Ubisoft also worked with Cirque du Soleil during the development of the game and that provided the theatrical feel and the costume designs

904
01:28:19,538 --> 01:28:28,821
[SPEAKER_01]: The music was composed by Beatrice Martin, also known as Croix de Pirate.

905
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:30,261
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you say pirate in French?

906
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,022
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the heart of the pirate.

907
01:28:32,762 --> 01:28:36,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is a Canadian singer and songwriter, clearly Quebecois.

908
01:28:38,603 --> 01:28:51,609
[SPEAKER_01]: and also worked with the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra recording the songs and her music was described as fresh, romantic and optimistic and embodied the feeling of Child of Light.

909
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it received mostly positive reviews.

910
01:28:55,655 --> 01:29:00,760
[SPEAKER_01]: The PS3 version from Metacritic had an 89 of 100, Switch 84 of 100, and Wii U 84 of 100, and PlayStation 4 82 of 100.

911
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox One 82 of 100, Xbox 360 74 of 100, and the PC version a 77 of 100.

912
01:29:02,982 --> 01:29:03,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

913
01:29:03,182 --> 01:29:03,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Average and up.

914
01:29:03,582 --> 01:29:03,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Um... There, uh...

915
01:29:17,995 --> 01:29:36,685
[SPEAKER_01]: or people like Vince Ignacio of IGN said the combat system was second to none but that sometimes the rhyming scheme kept it kept one from being able to really get into the meat of the characters

916
01:29:40,203 --> 01:29:51,894
[SPEAKER_01]: but everyone praised the feeling and the music and just the art style in general of the game and said that it was very refreshing to have that kind of game.

917
01:29:51,994 --> 01:29:57,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Alex Navarro of Giant Bomb was a lot more critical and he said that

918
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:08,351
[SPEAKER_01]: While the game is pretty, it didn't leave a lasting impact and the narrative seemed uninspired because it relied on childhood stories.

919
01:30:08,652 --> 01:30:13,257
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that sort of motif of the evil stepmother and magical kingdoms and all of that.

920
01:30:15,059 --> 01:30:17,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made it hard to understand the plot.

921
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:36,658
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there were people who just thought it wasn't hard enough but that there are still plenty of other people who thought it was an absolutely delightful game and at the 18th annual DICE Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences nominated it for the Handheld Game of the Year.

922
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:42,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there were other things that came with it, other media.

923
01:30:42,843 --> 01:30:51,410
[SPEAKER_01]: April 30, 2015, Ubisoft released a digital book for free called Child of Light, Reginald the Great, for the first anniversary.

924
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:54,192
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also written by the game's writer.

925
01:30:54,912 --> 01:30:55,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

926
01:30:58,056 --> 01:31:09,029
[SPEAKER_01]: An illustrator named Serge Marinho was involved in a new book set in the Child of Life universe.

927
01:31:10,991 --> 01:31:16,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had two other books already written and a third planned, but nothing was released.

928
01:31:16,598 --> 01:31:17,158
[SPEAKER_01]: No further books.

929
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:30,507
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also October 2018, Tasha Huo was working on a pilot for a TV show from Child of Light as a big fan of the game.

930
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:40,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on March 31st, 2022, Aurora was made as a playable character for Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.

931
01:31:43,448 --> 01:32:10,467
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's been stated that they wanted to do more with Child of Light and in fact there was when they were talking about the Switch release is that there had been teased a sequel for Child of Light 2 but we haven't seen anything there's also talk of a prequel we haven't seen anything but this was supposed to take inspiration from Swan Lake

932
01:32:11,303 --> 01:32:15,745
[SPEAKER_01]: and still have the watercolor themed art and more operatic and slightly more adult.

933
01:32:16,685 --> 01:32:20,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still haven't seen anything and it would be nice if we did.

934
01:32:23,807 --> 01:32:37,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually there is another note is that because Ubisoft's business model has changed, Plur does not think that there is going to be the prequel release because that's not the kind of game Ubisoft is looking to make now.

935
01:32:39,778 --> 01:32:40,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

936
01:32:40,779 --> 01:32:41,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Child of Light.

937
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:45,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for that classic Game of the Week pick, even if most of us are sitting here going, really?

938
01:32:45,983 --> 01:32:47,705
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is 10 years old now, huh?

939
01:32:48,025 --> 01:32:48,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

940
01:32:48,685 --> 01:32:49,866
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

941
01:32:49,926 --> 01:32:51,007
[SPEAKER_05]: That leaves me with a feeling.

942
01:32:52,789 --> 01:33:02,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Phil of Nine in our chat mentions, I remember when this came out and how much it stood out from other games because of the beautiful style.

943
01:33:02,497 --> 01:33:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree with that.

944
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:07,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And specifically, quite honestly, other Ubisoft games.

945
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:21,488
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice to see a big company like Ubisoft making games like this, which is why I let out the deep sigh I just did with that last comment about how Ubisoft doesn't make games like this anymore when this was just 10 years ago.

946
01:33:22,629 --> 01:33:23,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It's disappointing.

947
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:29,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that has to go back to what we were talking about earlier for taking risks and innovating.

948
01:33:29,993 --> 01:33:32,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And the designers did take a risk.

949
01:33:32,754 --> 01:33:33,274
[SPEAKER_01]: They did...

950
01:33:35,561 --> 01:33:43,167
[SPEAKER_01]: married a couple of different genre together to create something this beautiful and a game that people still remember with fondness.

951
01:33:43,467 --> 01:33:43,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

952
01:33:45,108 --> 01:33:45,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

953
01:33:45,368 --> 01:33:46,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for the pick.

954
01:33:46,309 --> 01:33:47,630
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is one more time.

955
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:54,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Child of Light from Ubisoft on PlayStation 3 and a variety of consoles of its time.

956
01:33:55,856 --> 01:33:56,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

957
01:33:56,236 --> 01:33:56,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, oh boy.

958
01:33:58,410 --> 01:33:58,670
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

959
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:01,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are going to move on.

960
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:08,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some more segments for you here on tonight's OLR, including some rapid fire news and where we cover some other headlines from the industry.

961
01:34:08,654 --> 01:34:09,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start with Loki.

962
01:34:10,755 --> 01:34:13,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about movie news, video game movie news.

963
01:34:13,396 --> 01:34:17,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got the announcement from Miyamoto that, hey, guess what?

964
01:34:17,497 --> 01:34:21,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Successful animated Mario movie has gained successful animated Mario sequel, right?

965
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:25,840
[SPEAKER_04]: That's now set for Japanese release of April 24th, 2026.

966
01:34:28,186 --> 01:34:29,587
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more years away for that.

967
01:34:30,567 --> 01:34:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And then... I hope Birdo's in it.

968
01:34:32,148 --> 01:34:32,508
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

969
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:46,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the sequel for a movie I didn't think really should have gotten a sequel, but the 2022 Uncharted... Hollywood can't make games like Child of Light either.

970
01:34:46,976 --> 01:34:51,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Hollywood has to just cash in established franchises because that's all that gets greenlit now.

971
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:51,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

972
01:34:52,179 --> 01:34:54,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't they make video games?

973
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:56,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we see that that was done.

974
01:34:56,762 --> 01:35:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: We had just some announcements of a movie studio making a video game studio and then making games.

975
01:35:01,185 --> 01:35:05,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but this is why are they going back to Undertale?

976
01:35:05,668 --> 01:35:07,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they going back to Uncharted?

977
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:08,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncharted?

978
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because you can do a generic action movie and people like that kind of stuff.

979
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:19,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, sequel for Uncharted, the 2022 movie, it has been announced.

980
01:35:19,998 --> 01:35:21,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mentioned in Sony

981
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:27,366
[SPEAKER_04]: and their Cine Europe announcement talking about their pipeline in upcoming movies.

982
01:35:27,506 --> 01:35:29,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a thing that's in production.

983
01:35:31,772 --> 01:35:32,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

984
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:34,055
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

985
01:35:37,173 --> 01:35:44,216
[SPEAKER_01]: A game that was revealed in 2004, so we're going to go back 20 years, finally got released.

986
01:35:46,357 --> 01:35:49,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Age of Pirates Captain Blood.

987
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:55,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a runaround hack and slash...

988
01:35:56,553 --> 01:35:56,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat Em Up

989
01:36:13,299 --> 01:36:39,640
[SPEAKER_01]: which tried to make it like a God of War game and it was finished in 2009 but Playlogic who was the previous publisher got into a big legal shebang with over the IP and so even though they'd already been printing discs and preparing them to ship it never actually launched there was a trailer in 2010 that promised a 2011 release and that didn't happen and then BAM

990
01:36:40,606 --> 01:36:56,606
[SPEAKER_01]: June 17th there's a revealed a new world premiere trailer and it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Switch, and PC so yeah it looks it looks like it could be fun it's it's you know Bastion with Pirates everything's better with Pirates

991
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:05,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of pirates, a really popular app on the iPhone right now is Delta, which of course is an emulator.

992
01:37:14,437 --> 01:37:15,438
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

993
01:37:33,172 --> 01:37:43,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I got rid of it when it stopped working on Xbox because for whatever reason there was a client for Xbox One that they never brought over to Series X. It might be there now, but it never did.

994
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:47,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So I canceled because I was like, if they're not going to have it on the newest Xbox, forget it.

995
01:37:47,664 --> 01:37:51,547
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's available on, of course, PC Windows.

996
01:37:52,168 --> 01:37:54,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It is also now going to be available on iPhone.

997
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:58,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be coming out on iOS on June 27th, I suppose.

998
01:37:58,593 --> 01:37:58,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

999
01:37:59,994 --> 01:38:00,795
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1000
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:44,760
[SPEAKER_05]: it even gets some random licenses like some PS1 games but they're not like you know you think like Hogs of War and things you probably actually didn't play on PlayStation unless maybe you were in Europe where Anstream is based anyway you can see more about Anstream's library over at anstream.com slash games and it is a streaming platform so you don't actually download the ROMs or anything like that but that's also you know that can be a positive and a negative so yeah

1001
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:55,771
[SPEAKER_05]: AntStream is usually $5 a month or $40 for a year, but apparently the introductory price is going to be $4 a month or $30 a year.

1002
01:38:55,851 --> 01:38:58,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if you want more information, AntStream.com.

1003
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:02,578
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these days I should re-up and see what they're up to over there these days.

1004
01:39:05,865 --> 01:39:29,231
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah it is very Eurocentric but I think that's you know what I think that's great that this is available now for more people you know especially when it's emulation in a way that the creators of the original games get a little coin hopefully so all right let's move on and check out some release dates of games coming out around the world starting with the US Loki

1005
01:39:31,089 --> 01:39:34,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so we've got actually quite a few things coming out this week.

1006
01:39:34,371 --> 01:39:39,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting off, Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition.

1007
01:39:40,994 --> 01:39:46,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1008
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:56,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogan Encore, we've got on PC, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1009
01:39:58,015 --> 01:40:24,830

[SPEAKER_04]: and uh let's see Nero uh Neo Sprint on a PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series and Atari VCS um uh Chia I guess that's how you pronounce that on Nintendo Switch um

1011
01:40:51,397 --> 01:41:02,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Tsukihime, a piece of blue glass moon on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1012
01:41:03,925 --> 01:41:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Spy x Anya Operation Memories on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1013
01:41:13,137 --> 01:41:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and I'm going to get to Japanese releases, but I was curious on this AntStream thing because somebody dropped a link in chat that showed all the games that you can play on the AntStream collection.

1014
01:41:22,605 --> 01:41:30,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I just do want to clarify for our listeners that, yes, Yars' Revenge is playable on AntStream.

1015
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:35,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you need another way to play Yars' Revenge in your collection...

1016
01:41:36,354 --> 01:41:36,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord.

1017
01:41:37,094 --> 01:41:38,235
[SPEAKER_05]: AntStream's got you handled.

1018
01:41:39,496 --> 01:41:40,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we're clear.

1019
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:40,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Worried about that.

1020
01:41:42,357 --> 01:41:42,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1021
01:41:42,777 --> 01:41:45,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little worried about it too, but we're A-OK.

1022
01:41:45,379 --> 01:41:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Good news.

1023
01:41:46,179 --> 01:41:48,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel Japan and check out the releases over there.

1024
01:41:49,681 --> 01:41:54,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Over in Japan, on the Nintendo Switch this next week, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, of course.

1025
01:41:54,963 --> 01:41:56,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be making its way out there as well.

1026
01:41:57,585 --> 01:42:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcana Alchemia is also out in a regular and a limited edition.

1027
01:42:01,967 --> 01:42:03,228
[SPEAKER_05]: A Street Cat's Tale...

1028
01:42:03,948 --> 01:42:06,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Appropriately, the Neko Neko Edition is out as well.

1029
01:42:08,211 --> 01:42:10,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the Switch as well.

1030
01:42:12,013 --> 01:42:15,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Iwakura Aria is also out in a regular and limited edition.

1031
01:42:16,035 --> 01:42:19,417
[SPEAKER_05]: The Night Witch in a, you guessed it, regular and limited edition.

1032
01:42:20,558 --> 01:42:28,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Neptunia vs. Titan Dogu, not like D-O-G-U-U, Dogu, is out as well.

1033
01:42:28,903 --> 01:42:33,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know I love Muv-Luv, and Muv-Luv Alternative Remastered Double Pack is

1034
01:42:34,586 --> 01:42:40,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's two Muv-Luv games coming out together also on the 27th of June in Japan.

1035
01:42:41,249 --> 01:42:45,290
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a game, I think this is interesting, Rise Zap for Nintendo Switch.

1036
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Rhythm Training.

1037
01:42:47,531 --> 01:42:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was kind of looking at it going, oh, is this like a DDR type of thing?

1038
01:42:51,552 --> 01:43:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like it's more like maybe boxing, like this type of rhythm thing because the screenshots kind of look like punching and that whole type of thing where you have a blue hand and a red hand, I guess, to go with the controls.

1039
01:43:01,395 --> 01:43:02,956
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting, I guess.

1040
01:43:03,396 --> 01:43:05,620
[SPEAKER_05]: What about an Ultra Hand?

1041
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,401
[SPEAKER_05]: To be determined.

1042
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:17,672
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation 5, meanwhile, we have Spy x Anya Operation Memories is out in Japan, which is called Spy x Family in other regions.

1043
01:43:17,712 --> 01:43:24,514
[SPEAKER_05]: But that Spy x Anya Operation Memories is out on June 27th, as is Deep Rock Galactic Special Edition.

1044
01:43:24,894 --> 01:43:28,975
[SPEAKER_05]: That same Neptunia vs Titan Doogoo is out as well.

1045
01:43:30,035 --> 01:43:31,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it for the PlayStation 5.

1046
01:43:32,236 --> 01:43:33,296
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

[SPEAKER_01]: We have on the 25th for PlayStation we have Monster Hunter Stories Collection.

[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1051
01:44:41,179 --> 01:44:44,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's muted.

1052
01:44:45,224 --> 01:44:45,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi Rob.

1053
01:44:46,065 --> 01:44:47,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi, sorry, I am muted, you're right.

1054
01:44:48,768 --> 01:44:49,088
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1055
01:44:49,469 --> 01:44:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, it's a pretty busy week for releases, and I wanted to get on to our next story on one of those releases Loki was talking about.

1056
01:44:59,079 --> 01:45:01,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, this is silly.

1057
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft had tweeted that the remaster, of course, of Beyond Good and Evil was coming June 25th on their official Twitter account.

1058
01:45:13,804 --> 01:45:15,385
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have deleted the tweet.

1059
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:19,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ready yet to announce.

1060
01:45:20,546 --> 01:45:20,846
[SPEAKER_01]: How?

1061
01:45:21,967 --> 01:45:22,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1062
01:45:22,787 --> 01:45:27,729
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, of course, there is already a trailer that's out for it.

1063
01:45:27,889 --> 01:45:28,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1064
01:45:30,152 --> 01:45:49,064
[SPEAKER_04]: it's it's common right then people played it remember it leaked on Ubisoft plus it's like they they just can't keep this a secret for whatever reason well especially you would think there'd be a little more hype behind it too with just a few days to go right we don't hype anything yeah

1065
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:59,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know how much people are hyping this, but for better or for worse, one of the biggest memes in gaming, and you can look up the memes for yourself.

1066
01:45:59,899 --> 01:46:06,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to explain it to you, but it was a classic video game, MMO-ish experience called Habbo Hotel.

1067
01:46:07,104 --> 01:46:07,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

1068
01:46:09,025 --> 01:46:10,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Haba Hotel Origins Haba Hotel Origins

1069
01:46:24,443 --> 01:46:26,244
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1070
01:46:48,739 --> 01:46:51,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Your avatar would chat with friends in a virtual hotel lobby.

1071
01:46:51,981 --> 01:46:56,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You could spend credits on furniture and accessories and decorate your guest room and all that good stuff.

1072
01:46:57,324 --> 01:46:59,445
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two other whole versions on the site as well.

1073
01:46:59,806 --> 01:47:10,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mackelby is the creator of this and I guess just kind of came across the files saying after discovering an old decrepit server with some long lost files at the beginning of this year.

1074
01:47:11,472 --> 01:47:20,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the past six months or so, longtime Habbo developer and player McElbee has lovingly restored an old version of Habbo Hotel first released in 2005.

1075
01:47:20,621 --> 01:47:26,347
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying this new version will have a fresh community-led approach.

1076
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:38,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning that the Info Bus Park, which was an area in the original game, is now a democratic forum where they will answer player questions about the development and direction of the game.

1077
01:47:39,097 --> 01:47:44,442
[SPEAKER_05]: That was originally a waiting area for players to board the bus, which only ran for a few hours a day.

1078
01:47:45,482 --> 01:47:53,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, now you may only make an account if you are 18 years of age or higher, not 13, because again, the original game

1079
01:47:55,737 --> 01:47:56,317
[SPEAKER_05]: End of sentence.

1080
01:47:57,759 --> 01:47:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I need to say about it.

1081
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,941
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we all signed up and made it Woken Gay?

1082
01:48:01,882 --> 01:48:12,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you would hope that maybe with the Democratic Forum and all this stuff, maybe, you know, maybe everybody's grown the fuck up in the last 20 years and maybe this new version will be Woken Gay.

1083
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:18,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me just say, I don't... Yeah, I'm with Loki on where I predict... I don't think it's Democratic in the sense of Democratic Party.

1084
01:48:18,274 --> 01:48:19,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1085
01:48:19,275 --> 01:48:19,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

1086
01:48:19,895 --> 01:48:21,076
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm... Yeah.

1087
01:48:21,957 --> 01:48:22,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1088
01:48:23,758 --> 01:48:26,261
[SPEAKER_05]: All of you making pool jokes in chat are banned.

1089
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, I'm getting out my hammer.

1090
01:48:28,284 --> 01:48:31,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Banned, but you get a ban and you get a ban and you get a ban.

1091
01:48:32,188 --> 01:48:32,489
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1092
01:48:32,869 --> 01:48:39,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I actually questioned if I want to bring it up or not, but I think you have to go.

1093
01:48:39,737 --> 01:48:40,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing too.

1094
01:48:40,799 --> 01:48:41,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it this way.

1095
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:48,743
[SPEAKER_05]: All the people that participated in those types of events were probably 17 or 18 at the time.

1096
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:52,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Those same people are 37 and 38 now.

1097
01:48:53,566 --> 01:48:53,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1098
01:48:54,646 --> 01:49:08,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So if us talking about Child of Light made you feel old, how old do you think some of those people who participated in such tomfoolery are feeling now with this re-release of this game?

1099
01:49:10,191 --> 01:49:23,984
[SPEAKER_05]: anyway Ranmari in chat says if I do return to Habbo Hotel I am going to instead shout trans rights at the pool as one should do you should just shout trans rights at a real pool

1100
01:49:25,595 --> 01:49:26,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1101
01:49:26,096 --> 01:49:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1102
01:49:26,716 --> 01:49:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there was an emote in Diablo 4 that I unlocked on my character.

1103
01:49:30,881 --> 01:49:42,694
[SPEAKER_05]: When the character does the emote, I swear, I swear the sprinkles, little stardust that he leaves behind, I swear to God, they're in the colors of very light blue, white, and pink.

1104
01:49:43,155 --> 01:49:44,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Where else do we see those colors together?

1105
01:49:46,274 --> 01:49:46,974
[SPEAKER_05]: The trans flag.

1106
01:49:47,714 --> 01:49:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm almost positive Diablo has a trans right emote in the game.

1107
01:49:51,495 --> 01:49:52,555
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm calling it anyway.

1108
01:49:53,055 --> 01:49:54,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1109
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:56,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy pride, by the way.

1110
01:49:56,996 --> 01:50:02,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to the listener round table and invite your feedback as we do every week.

1111
01:50:02,978 --> 01:50:08,119
[SPEAKER_05]: You can join our green room if you're feeling like it over at our vognetwork.com slash discord.

1112
01:50:08,379 --> 01:50:11,500
[SPEAKER_05]: You could also just join our discord server to say hi to us throughout the week.

1113
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:12,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You can...

1114
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:17,283
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a whole channel dedicated to when celebrities pass away.

1115
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:21,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw will make a post about it and you can have your moment of awe.

1116
01:50:21,546 --> 01:50:23,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like when Donald Sutherland passed away this week, which is sad.

1117
01:50:24,028 --> 01:50:25,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not here to make light of it.

1118
01:50:25,509 --> 01:50:30,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was 88, which he had a good life and it was kind of one of those like, oh, that's too bad.

1119
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:32,675
[SPEAKER_05]: But it takes you a minute to...

1120
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:38,272
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, remember these awesome celebrities that unfortunately we have lost.

1121
01:50:38,512 --> 01:50:43,714
[SPEAKER_05]: But trust me, there's much more in the Discord server than just the In Memoriam channel.

1122
01:50:44,955 --> 01:50:46,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your way to talk with us every week.

1123
01:50:47,336 --> 01:50:58,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but I think we actually have much more talking going on in the mailbag than we're used to over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com What are you doing?

1124
01:50:58,221 --> 01:50:59,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one person emailed twice.

1125
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:00,141
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1126
01:51:00,382 --> 01:51:03,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, there is a one and a half email limit per week.

1127
01:51:04,844 --> 01:51:06,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll go ahead and start with the first one.

1128
01:51:06,865 --> 01:51:07,165
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1129
01:51:07,566 --> 01:51:08,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hello, LR.

1130
01:51:08,966 --> 01:51:18,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Catching up on the June 9th episode of the show, Rob mentions that the PC adapter for the PlayStation VR 2 moves onto his wishlist.

1131
01:51:18,292 --> 01:51:18,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1132
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:21,293
[SPEAKER_01]: To be completely honest, I received this news as the opposite.

1133
01:51:21,353 --> 01:51:27,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, this one song for the headset is kind of like the PlayStation VR 2 got its R21 patch.

1134
01:51:28,017 --> 01:51:29,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe pause for a moment.

1135
01:51:29,178 --> 01:51:30,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that reference ring a bell with anyone?

1136
01:51:31,539 --> 01:51:38,503
[SPEAKER_01]: You may recall all the way back in 2006 that In The Groove 2 was a thing, at least until Konami sued its developers and publisher.

1137
01:51:39,004 --> 01:51:45,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Just weeks before the announcement of the settlement would end the series, a patch was released for ITG2 called R21.

1138
01:51:45,548 --> 01:51:51,432
[SPEAKER_01]: This patch allowed players to play their own songs and step charts off of USB drives simply by plugging them into the machine.

1139
01:51:52,617 --> 01:51:53,598
[SPEAKER_01]: But why, players asked.

1140
01:51:54,099 --> 01:52:00,065
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can play any song or chart off USB, doesn't that render new versions pointless?

1141
01:52:00,746 --> 01:52:03,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the settlement was announced, so we knew why.

1142
01:52:03,269 --> 01:52:06,533
[SPEAKER_01]: R21 existed only because the game was no longer commercially viable.

1143
01:52:07,173 --> 01:52:10,817
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be no In the Groove 3, so why not sabotage the current version?

1144
01:52:10,917 --> 01:52:12,880
[SPEAKER_01]: At least players would get something more out of it.

1145
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:22,068
[SPEAKER_01]: According to an Ars Technica article from back in March, hundreds of thousands of unsold PSVR2 units are sitting in warehouses.

1146
01:52:22,649 --> 01:52:30,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony needs a way to entice folks to buy the remaining inventory, and they're seemingly reluctant to run discounts on much of anything nowadays.

1147
01:52:30,697 --> 01:52:38,284
[SPEAKER_01]: They have announced exactly zero first-party gains coming to the headset over the foreseeable future, and I'd put down a few bucks that no more are coming.

1148
01:52:38,684 --> 01:52:44,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's face it, outside of plugging a few third-party titles here or there, Sony is fully and completely done with PSVR 2.

1149
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:52,945
[SPEAKER_01]: This is their R21 patch allowing existing owners to get a bit more mileage out of it, perhaps enticing a few more folks to buy one.

1150
01:52:53,506 --> 01:52:57,108
[SPEAKER_01]: During people to PC to buy games cuts themselves out.

1151
01:52:57,509 --> 01:53:04,995
[SPEAKER_01]: They no longer get the 30% cut that they'd get on the PlayStation Store, which defeats the point of having a walled garden in the first place.

1152
01:53:05,475 --> 01:53:09,978
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no financial reason for them to do this unless they're calling it quits, which they are.

1153
01:53:10,879 --> 01:53:13,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I would not recommend buying a PSVR 2 at this point.

1154
01:53:14,081 --> 01:53:21,926
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that in the past, multi-platform games are designed with the most popular platform in mind, and when it comes to VR, that platform is Oculus Quest.

1155
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:28,730
[SPEAKER_01]: From now onward, almost all of what we're going to see on PSVR 2 are just ports to the game designed for Quest.

1156
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:31,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame, but Sony basically sent this thing to die.

1157
01:53:32,412 --> 01:53:35,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, too many games this next weekend, April 28th through 30th.

1158
01:53:36,274 --> 01:53:36,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1159
01:53:36,995 --> 01:53:45,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Come visit me and play Super Duper Multitasking, or if you don't want to talk to anyone, you can just watch the 15-minute looping video I'm producing for the booth.

1160
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:46,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy your week, and YYR.

1161
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:48,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the email.

1162
01:53:48,821 --> 01:53:51,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do remember the R21s, right?

1163
01:53:51,342 --> 01:53:55,484
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S in chat says the whole R21 thing sounds more like a coincidence than anything else.

1164
01:53:55,644 --> 01:53:58,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, that was a Trojan horse.

1165
01:53:58,726 --> 01:54:04,709
[SPEAKER_05]: That was absolutely purposeful, but it was a brilliant little device knowing what's coming.

1166
01:54:05,629 --> 01:54:07,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was an interesting trip down memory lane.

1167
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:10,291
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of reminds me of the kill switch we all know is lurking in Steam.

1168
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:14,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday Steam is going to push a button that unlocks all those games in your library.

1169
01:54:14,473 --> 01:54:16,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to connect online to play them anymore.

1170
01:54:17,155 --> 01:54:20,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know it's in the terms and conditions we accept with Steam and all that stuff.

1171
01:54:21,296 --> 01:54:24,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I do want to go back though and address what was said earlier.

1172
01:54:24,878 --> 01:54:26,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not taking back what I said.

1173
01:54:26,539 --> 01:54:27,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not backtracking.

1174
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:30,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to clarify what I mean when I say it's on my wish list.

1175
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:33,041
[SPEAKER_05]: My birthday is this week, okay?

1176
01:54:33,121 --> 01:54:33,741
[SPEAKER_05]: My birthday.

1177
01:54:33,861 --> 01:54:34,962
[SPEAKER_05]: My birthday is coming up.

1178
01:54:35,022 --> 01:54:35,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my birthday.

1179
01:54:36,282 --> 01:54:38,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just OLR's birthday, but it's my birthday.

1180
01:54:39,302 --> 01:54:41,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to be a lot older than OLR.

1181
01:54:41,903 --> 01:54:45,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I say it's on my wish list, it's on my wish list for someone else to buy me.

1182
01:54:46,024 --> 01:54:46,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't mind.

1183
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,244
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have better things to buy for myself.

1184
01:54:49,604 --> 01:54:52,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And I already know Husband did not get me a PSVR 2.

1185
01:54:52,925 --> 01:54:54,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I already know what Husband got me for my birthday.

1186
01:54:54,565 --> 01:54:55,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually brought it up on last week's show.

1187
01:54:55,885 --> 01:54:57,006
[SPEAKER_05]: He got me the Evercade...

1188
01:55:00,424 --> 01:55:03,987
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1189
01:55:16,796 --> 01:55:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I do still, at least for the moment, and this is where I'm not going to backtrack my comment, I still look at PSVR 2 as a device that plays PSVR games and PC VR games.

1190
01:55:28,523 --> 01:55:32,025
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the moment, it seems like an attractive option in that space.

1191
01:55:32,645 --> 01:55:47,422
[SPEAKER_05]: that being said I do agree with what you're saying at the second part of that email and I think we see that in the news story we talked about earlier that even Sony seems to not have a lot of stock in this anymore and it's only a matter of time before PC ultimately surpasses it in that space

1192
01:55:48,263 --> 01:55:52,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at the end of the day, I'm just interested in other things in tech right now.

1193
01:55:52,744 --> 01:55:57,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I think VR has been unable to produce that must-have game.

1194
01:55:57,626 --> 01:56:01,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been unable to produce that Wii Sports.

1195
01:56:01,787 --> 01:56:04,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gotten close with...

1196
01:56:07,009 --> 01:56:28,563
[SPEAKER_05]: like Beat Saber and maybe even VRChat to an extent although I still consider that a party trick sorry to the furry community I know that loves that game but I still consider it a party trick and Half-Life Alyx but I don't feel like anything is really just said no seriously you fucking need VR so until the industry makes it

1197
01:56:29,837 --> 01:56:34,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm content buying a bunch of other bullshit as opposed to a VR headset.

1198
01:56:34,299 --> 01:56:35,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say wait.

1199
01:56:37,021 --> 01:56:39,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting.

1200
01:56:39,862 --> 01:56:40,642
[SPEAKER_01]: For two words.

1201
01:56:41,363 --> 01:56:43,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Vision Pro.

1202
01:56:43,784 --> 01:56:49,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything, but just having used one, I'm just going to say wait.

1203
01:56:50,427 --> 01:56:52,388
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to discover what it can do.

1204
01:56:54,787 --> 01:57:03,905
[SPEAKER_01]: and I really have a feeling that we're going to see dedicated VR systems and not just the whole going the full tech route.

1205
01:57:04,551 --> 01:57:09,453
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of rumors in that space too, but we'll save that for another time.

1206
01:57:10,213 --> 01:57:16,756
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR in chat though wants to say, Gran Turismo 7, Resident Evil 4 and 8 have made the headset worthwhile for some folks all by themselves.

1207
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:20,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to discount your comment, but there's a big problem.

1208
01:57:20,838 --> 01:57:23,259
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big problem with those three games that you mentioned.

1209
01:57:23,339 --> 01:57:24,239
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the games are great.

1210
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:27,261
[SPEAKER_05]: They all are also playable outside of VR.

1211
01:57:28,382 --> 01:57:34,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whereas VR may enhance the experience, VR doesn't feel necessary to the experience.

1212
01:57:35,106 --> 01:57:35,946
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.

1213
01:57:36,587 --> 01:57:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

1214
01:57:38,488 --> 01:57:48,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just hoping that they finally port, whatever, the not-until-dawn, the other non-until-dawn game.

1215
01:57:48,754 --> 01:57:49,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Quarry?

1216
01:57:49,194 --> 01:57:49,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1217
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:52,172
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not the quarry, the VR one.

1218
01:57:52,252 --> 01:57:52,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they port.

1219
01:57:53,133 --> 01:57:56,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I hope they import Until Dawn of Russia Blood.

1220
01:57:56,314 --> 01:57:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what to tell you.

1221
01:57:57,255 --> 01:57:59,716
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the, yeah, I know what to tell you about that.

1222
01:58:00,397 --> 01:58:01,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, I can't remember the name of it.

1223
01:58:01,557 --> 01:58:02,418
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Russia Blood.

1224
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:04,479
[SPEAKER_05]: They did it on PSVR 2.

1225
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:07,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the anthology game.

1226
01:58:08,421 --> 01:58:09,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1227
01:58:09,081 --> 01:58:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Their other series, yeah.

1228
01:58:10,962 --> 01:58:12,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that on VR, please.

1229
01:58:13,223 --> 01:58:13,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Please and thank you.

1230
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I think you said YYR had a second email.

1231
01:58:17,484 --> 01:58:19,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I was just being a jerk earlier.

1232
01:58:20,669 --> 01:58:45,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, hello LR, I listened to last week's show during a 3 hour drive today and just wanted to drop a note, sorry for the double email Loki mentioned his trip to round 1 last weekend and mused that they might be getting an upgraded version of DDR soon Well actually both of the DDR cabs there were already running on the brand new DDR world while he was there All machines were automatically updated via network on June 12th and began running the new version once they received the update and were rebooted once

1233
01:58:46,042 --> 01:58:50,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case you're out of the DDR loop and want to try the new version, here are a few quick tips.

1234
01:58:51,326 --> 01:58:57,249
[SPEAKER_01]: One, if you want to set options such as scrolling speed, you can no longer hold the decision button to access the options menu.

1235
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:07,416
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either press the number nine on the keypad that you use to enter your pin at login time or use the arrow buttons to highlight options from the difficulty selection screen.

1236
01:59:08,036 --> 01:59:08,857
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not crazy.

1237
01:59:09,497 --> 01:59:10,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad they made it easy for us.

1238
01:59:11,379 --> 01:59:11,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.

1239
01:59:13,419 --> 01:59:14,159
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not crazy.

1240
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:18,720
[SPEAKER_01]: There is now just one green generic animated background for literally every song in the game.

1241
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:20,780
[SPEAKER_01]: The dancing characters have once again been removed.

1242
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:25,141
[SPEAKER_01]: When selecting songs, the folders for version, level, genre, etc.

1243
01:59:25,501 --> 01:59:27,982
[SPEAKER_01]: have all been removed or replaced by any filter feature.

1244
01:59:28,082 --> 01:59:32,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Press number 6 on the keypad to adjust the filter.

1245
01:59:32,902 --> 01:59:39,324
[SPEAKER_01]: You can select multiple criteria at once, so basically you get more power at the expense of simplicity.

1246
01:59:39,724 --> 01:59:41,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it's annoying until you get used to it.

1247
01:59:41,704 --> 02:00:10,183
[SPEAKER_01]: and just a reminder in the USA you will only find this version at round one locations Dave and Busters is still stuck on A20 plus and if I had to guess in one to two years they'll all be gone and replaced by Step Maniacs we shall see enjoy your week and happy gaming AaronYYR with all due respect to YYR your email did not make me enthused to go play DDR World I have a Step Maniacs machine a lot closer to me downtown and I think I'll just go play that instead yeah they have a Step Maniacs machine there too um

1248
02:00:12,017 --> 02:00:33,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Coinoff downtown got one my friends posted an Instagram story of them playing it and it looks bright and beautiful and that whole building got remodeled a few months that's why they were closed for a few months so I'm like super curious about that one I mean that's cool yeah I don't know like yeah it sucks that DDR is kind of like half-assed in it right now but

1249
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:37,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That just means the step charts will come out and I'll just put them on step me.

1250
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I don't know.

1251
02:00:40,958 --> 02:00:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, step me doesn't work on my PC anymore because my PC's broke.

1252
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:47,122
[SPEAKER_05]: The background thing is really weird to me.

1253
02:00:47,563 --> 02:00:48,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheap.

1254
02:00:48,884 --> 02:00:50,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds Russian cheap.

1255
02:00:51,826 --> 02:00:52,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1256
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:40,093
[SPEAKER_01]: the secret rendezvous that one that had all the people in the limo like those those visuals were really silly and fun that's some of the best part you know I'm gonna tell you a reason why I think all the backgrounds are like that plug and play updates as an internet style as you don't have to worry about new backgrounds and everything you are just importing the song into one set background and there you go

1257
02:01:43,027 --> 02:01:44,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OL Army, Dear OL Army, Dear OL Army,

1258
02:01:59,023 --> 02:02:01,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's your girl Mishi here.

1259
02:02:01,664 --> 02:02:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, sorry for the lengthy email and bad grammar.

1260
02:02:04,105 --> 02:02:04,506
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

1261
02:02:04,986 --> 02:02:07,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone picked up any new games this week, this month?

1262
02:02:07,307 --> 02:02:08,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Any games you're looking forward to?

1263
02:02:09,048 --> 02:02:10,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have and they're pretty fun too.

1264
02:02:11,108 --> 02:02:13,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to pick up two Farming Sims.

1265
02:02:13,349 --> 02:02:14,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's go with that.

1266
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:14,470
[SPEAKER_01]: LOL.

1267
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:21,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the games I picked up are called Moonstone Island where you play a fledgling alchemist who's sent away from home for a year.

1268
02:02:21,673 --> 02:02:22,173
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1269
02:02:41,641 --> 02:02:44,022
[SPEAKER_01]: This game is an extra of Animal Crossing meets Stardew Valley.

1270
02:02:44,042 --> 02:02:48,903
[SPEAKER_01]: You play as someone who can't remember who they are or how they got to Ever After Falls.

1271
02:02:49,383 --> 02:02:50,723
[SPEAKER_01]: In this game, there are quests.

1272
02:02:51,043 --> 02:02:55,144
[SPEAKER_01]: You run a farm and also this game has a gardening mechanic.

1273
02:02:55,644 --> 02:02:57,385
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's like creepy Stardew Valley.

1274
02:02:57,485 --> 02:02:58,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, sorry for the long email.

1275
02:02:58,845 --> 02:03:00,145
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'll say happy gaming.

1276
02:03:00,185 --> 02:03:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the show and have a great night.

1277
02:03:01,766 --> 02:03:02,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Sincerely, Mishkins.

1278
02:03:03,803 --> 02:03:05,905
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a tweet compared to YYR's emails.

1279
02:03:06,085 --> 02:03:07,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Mish, you don't got to apologize.

1280
02:03:08,526 --> 02:03:11,529
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but always a delight to hear from both individuals.

1281
02:03:12,789 --> 02:03:24,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I appreciate the recommendations of games that might not otherwise be on our radar because I think you kind of highlighted some more indie or smaller games that, you know, they don't always get a lot of coverage like some of the other games we talk about.

1282
02:03:24,298 --> 02:03:27,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So I definitely rely on the listeners to put some of those games on our radar.

1283
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:31,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So I encourage you all to email us, participate at OrangeLandsRadar.com.

1284
02:03:32,003 --> 02:03:56,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I heard a question in there though about what are we looking forward to for me personally my avatar DLC oh yeah I know that's up your alley yeah and for me for me it's expansions too Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail Diablo 4 or yeah Diablo 4 has their expansion in October other things I was trying to think like outside of that the Nintendo World Championships we were talking about earlier in the show is next month for sure

1285
02:03:56,645 --> 02:03:57,505
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1286
02:04:18,430 --> 02:04:19,851
[SPEAKER_05]: and what they're going to do with that.

1287
02:04:20,171 --> 02:04:22,072
[SPEAKER_05]: My hope is it's going to turn out pretty good.

1288
02:04:22,953 --> 02:04:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill 2 remake, again, speaking of morbid curiosities, I really feel like people have very polarizing opinions about that remake.

1289
02:04:30,717 --> 02:04:31,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to try it out.

1290
02:04:32,278 --> 02:04:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely want to try out the Silent Hill 2 remake.

1291
02:04:34,299 --> 02:04:38,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the Dragon Quest remasters we were talking about earlier in the show.

1292
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:39,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot to look forward to for sure.

1293
02:04:41,983 --> 02:04:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, anything you're looking forward to?

1294
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:48,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's probably the stuff I'm not aware of, like, you know, the game that's behind me.

1295
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:53,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I was totally unaware of that, and then now it's out, and it's worth checking out.

1296
02:04:54,442 --> 02:05:00,144
[SPEAKER_04]: As for upcoming games, I mean, the new Zelda game might be fun.

1297
02:05:03,165 --> 02:05:05,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's just the stuff that I'm unaware of.

1298
02:05:05,766 --> 02:05:06,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to try...

1299
02:05:09,574 --> 02:05:12,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, what's the... Obsidian RPG.

1300
02:05:13,697 --> 02:05:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, um... I want to say like Arisen, but it's not... Yeah, no, I know what you mean.

1301
02:05:19,522 --> 02:05:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Avowed.

1302
02:05:19,882 --> 02:05:21,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Avowed.

1303
02:05:21,563 --> 02:05:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it began with an A. Yeah, Avowed I think would be kind of cool to check out because it has that Skyrim vibes and...

1304
02:05:30,702 --> 02:05:54,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like really enjoying indies like this year like like I said I've been like gushing over Turbo Kid that game looks awesome um and I've almost finished it and they keep updating it uh I definitely want to play um Blood I want to check that out um yeah I don't know so we'll see what other stuff comes out this year Squirrel the Gun yeah we'll play that

1305
02:05:57,729 --> 02:05:58,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Great suggestions, everybody.

1306
02:05:59,650 --> 02:06:03,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1307
02:06:04,271 --> 02:06:09,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranmari says, I want to give Diablo 4 a spin, but I'm hesitant to give money to Blizzard these days.

1308
02:06:09,793 --> 02:06:12,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for better or for worse, you wouldn't be giving money to Blizzard.

1309
02:06:12,333 --> 02:06:14,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be giving money to Microsoft at this point.

1310
02:06:14,754 --> 02:06:17,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, for better or for worse, your choice on how you feel about that.

1311
02:06:18,415 --> 02:06:24,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I will point out, though, that Microsoft does have Diablo 4 on Game Pass if you're a Game Pass person.

1312
02:06:25,077 --> 02:06:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not a Game Pass person, then I guess I would recommend check out streams and YouTubes and see if it's for you.

1313
02:06:31,503 --> 02:06:37,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it, but I've also always had an affinity for Diablo and those types of games.

1314
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:41,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So I recognize that, yeah, my opinion's like really biased.

1315
02:06:41,953 --> 02:06:43,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is what it is.

1316
02:06:43,935 --> 02:06:48,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I can only give you advice on how to check it out for yourself.

1317
02:06:49,977 --> 02:06:51,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

1318
02:07:07,829 --> 02:07:13,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 4, you know, it's still over the top in some ways, but it's not quite as fast-paced as 3 was.

1319
02:07:14,152 --> 02:07:18,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll get there after all the expansions and stuff, but it's a little bit of a different flavor.

1320
02:07:18,994 --> 02:07:20,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little more in line with Diablo 2 than 3.

1321
02:07:23,355 --> 02:07:23,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1322
02:07:25,816 --> 02:07:27,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.

1323
02:07:27,917 --> 02:07:28,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Last-minute story.

1324
02:07:28,938 --> 02:07:30,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, last-minute stories, please.

1325
02:07:31,138 --> 02:07:31,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1326
02:07:31,919 --> 02:07:34,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So, everyone remember the Neptune story?

1327
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:36,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

1328
02:08:02,063 --> 02:08:03,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned this many, many a time.

1329
02:08:03,785 --> 02:08:06,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The Master System has stayed popular in Brazil.

1330
02:08:07,309 --> 02:08:11,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Sega consoles are going to be a big thing.

1331
02:08:11,473 --> 02:08:13,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to get my hands on one of these, to be honest.

1332
02:08:15,718 --> 02:08:16,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I thought it was cool.

1333
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:17,300
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's neat.

1334
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,241
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

1335
02:08:19,983 --> 02:08:20,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how about you?

1336
02:08:20,904 --> 02:08:21,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Any last-minute stories from you?

1337
02:08:23,364 --> 02:08:37,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we have one from the Slay the Princess developer, Black Tabby Games, basically, well, they've deleted the tweets, but they basically said, hey, if you can't afford our game, go pirate it.

1338
02:08:39,176 --> 02:08:41,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they're not the first developer to do this recently.

1339
02:08:43,171 --> 02:08:57,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's more along the lines of like they're saying, you know, don't necessarily like watch through like everybody's playthroughs and stuff online, but you can pirate it and hey, we're going to be, you know, starting our games on a Steam summer sale on the 27th.

1340
02:08:57,273 --> 02:09:04,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can go download it or buy it for a discounted price then if you can afford it or something like that.

1341
02:09:05,675 --> 02:09:11,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear some other game did the exact same thing that said it wasn't the same, but they said I would rather you pirate our game than watch a Let's Play.

1342
02:09:13,106 --> 02:09:17,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear there was somebody to say it wasn't the same but why can't we have both yeah I know I know

1343
02:09:19,306 --> 02:09:20,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, interesting.

1344
02:09:21,947 --> 02:09:23,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, everybody's entitled to their opinion.

1345
02:09:24,267 --> 02:09:24,607
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1346
02:09:25,227 --> 02:09:29,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we hope you enjoyed our opinions over the last few hours, but we always welcome yours as well.

1347
02:09:29,708 --> 02:09:30,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you can always send us an email.

1348
02:09:30,948 --> 02:09:32,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Participate at orangesoundtrader.com.

1349
02:09:33,329 --> 02:09:35,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Join our Discord and chat with us throughout the week.

1350
02:09:35,409 --> 02:09:38,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, I'm reading YouTube comments now too, so you can always leave us a comment there.

1351
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:40,330
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate that.

1352
02:09:40,370 --> 02:09:41,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout it into the void.

1353
02:09:41,290 --> 02:09:42,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably see it eventually.

1354
02:09:42,951 --> 02:09:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1355
02:09:45,592 --> 02:09:54,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rinmari reminds us, I did read about a game dev that said, we'd rather you pirate our game than buy keys on G2A that were probably obtained with credit card fraud.

1356
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:56,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that was definitely a thing.

1357
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.

1358
02:09:58,402 --> 02:10:01,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And then YYR wants to point out something he forgot in his DDR email.

1359
02:10:01,985 --> 02:10:07,269
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no longer any differences gameplay wise between the gold 20th anniversary cabinet and the others.

1360
02:10:07,749 --> 02:10:08,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1361
02:10:08,850 --> 02:10:08,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1362
02:10:10,285 --> 02:10:10,805
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1363
02:10:36,576 --> 02:10:38,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Those all go an awful long way.

1364
02:10:38,237 --> 02:10:44,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for all of the nice reviews and word of mouth and even tweets and blue sky posts and all that good stuff.

1365
02:10:45,201 --> 02:10:46,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate y'all spreading the word.

1366
02:10:48,363 --> 02:10:48,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1367
02:10:49,564 --> 02:10:50,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to share here.

1368
02:10:50,845 --> 02:10:52,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I will just kick it over to final thoughts.

1369
02:10:53,046 --> 02:10:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, why don't you give us your final thought?

[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a busy month.

1373
02:11:25,452 --> 02:11:29,582
[SPEAKER_01]: My feet are going to hurt and I'm going to have some bad eye strain.

1374
02:11:29,742 --> 02:11:30,023
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1375
02:11:30,926 --> 02:11:50,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I officially have a gig at Bear Dive believe it or not that night Saturday night during California Extreme so I will not be able to go sadly but I mean not that sad because I love doing gigs and I love the troupe that I get to host for but the timing is a bummer of course tis what tis alright well have a great stream DarkSakura

1376
02:11:51,701 --> 02:12:19,100
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you everybody we'll see you hopefully next week but maybe in two weeks it sounds like that's going to be interesting because Bobby Blackwolf isn't here next week either because the summer games don't click so yeah and I didn't realize it was I mean it starts at 2 but we come in like toward the end of the first act so I don't know how long I'm going to be there well just text me and we'll figure it out we'll make it up as we go along like we always do that's right that's how we keep it running alright bye DarkSakura

1378
02:12:24,767 --> 02:12:30,430

1379
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:39,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking a week off to work on the big theme park ride, the first major one, so hopefully we'll get that out in July.

1380
02:12:39,174 --> 02:12:41,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be conservative about it.

1381
02:12:43,128 --> 02:12:49,111
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is thank you to Sinister Creature Con for having me host the cosplay contest yesterday.

1382
02:12:49,151 --> 02:12:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun and there were some very creative costumes.

1383
02:12:52,292 --> 02:12:54,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy always seeing that type of stuff.

1384
02:12:54,453 --> 02:13:00,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked the audience choice winner who was kind of like an interpretation of Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas, but it looked really cool.

1385
02:13:01,637 --> 02:13:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm a fan of a lot of the outfits.

1386
02:13:03,918 --> 02:13:04,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that.

1387
02:13:05,158 --> 02:13:09,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I look forward to some more events here locally in the Sacramento area.

1388
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocky Horror Picture Show on July 20th and Scream Queens Gorlesque over at Bear Dive on July 27th.

1389
02:13:16,528 --> 02:13:21,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to my friends at lovehorrorevents.com where all that stuff goes down.

1390
02:13:21,773 --> 02:13:23,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is it.

1391
02:13:24,016 --> 02:13:25,797
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S says, can you share photos?

1392
02:13:26,879 --> 02:13:27,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

1393
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:28,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I was...

1394
02:13:29,741 --> 02:13:32,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't take any because I was hosting it.

1395
02:13:32,624 --> 02:13:33,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know what?

1396
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:38,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, the professional photos, I mean, there's some phone photos that are out there, but you know what?

1397
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:41,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Our professional photographers, they'll start posting in the next couple days.

1398
02:13:41,991 --> 02:13:51,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I have some of those, I'll send them to you because I think you'll enjoy some of the outfits because it's very different than an anime convention because, of course, you have people like Jason and Freddy and scary stuff.

1399
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:56,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody did the May Queen from... Not Hereditary, the other one from...

1400
02:13:58,666 --> 02:14:01,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, Midsommar, which I thought was really clever as well.

1401
02:14:02,049 --> 02:14:06,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'll share that once I have the professional photos.

1402
02:14:08,013 --> 02:14:08,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really it.

1403
02:14:08,834 --> 02:14:10,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again so much otherwise.

1404
02:14:11,756 --> 02:14:14,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll do it for this week's show.

1405
02:14:14,238 --> 02:14:15,980
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you in seven days to do all over again.

1406
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:16,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye everybody.

1407
02:14:19,443 --> 02:14:23,806
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1408
02:14:23,986 --> 02:14:27,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
