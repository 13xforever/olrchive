00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:14,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here, Rob Roberts, with my co-hosts who join me every week.

7
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,317
[SPEAKER_02]: First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jamie was having a mic issue before the show and I'm not sure Isn't it working now?

9
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:33,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, now it is, that's so weird I said hi I know, but the hi didn't come through, so it's weird Everything's broken Did that work?

10
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:47,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that worked, yes, loud and clear, we heard that Alright, so Jamie will just be speaking in raspberries all night long Nah Who is the last person you blew raspberries at?

11
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:48,885
[SPEAKER_05]: A cat

12
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:52,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine would have been a Lexus driver, for sure.

13
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Midna was doing her usual, I want to be fed, I've never been fed before.

14
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:04,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh yeah.

15
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:06,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And she didn't know what to make of that.

16
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:16,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it whenever I get cut off in traffic, it's always a Lexus, BMW, a Mercedes, or now a Tesla?

17
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it always one of those vehicles?

18
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:19,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Entitled drivers.

19
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:21,884
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know the answer.

20
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:30,471
[SPEAKER_06]: You named all of these semi-luxury brands and they're all entitled.

21
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my car is expensive.

22
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:35,095
[SPEAKER_06]: No one would dare run into me.

23
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch me demolish my Fiat to make a point.

24
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch next time you get cut off in traffic.

25
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a note of the make and model of the car because you're going to notice some patterns.

26
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:45,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

27
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:46,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I just brake check them.

28
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:48,165
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

29
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:53,396
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not want to have to deal with a fiat on their insurance.

30
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:58,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's check the breaks on the one and only Techmaster Loki.

31
00:02:59,619 --> 00:02:59,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how are you doing, Loki?

33
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.

34
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was the last person you blew raspberries at?

35
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:05,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I guess, Animal.

36
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:09,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

37
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:10,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's fine.

38
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you insinuating my cat is not a people?

39
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:15,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just say something in Minecraft.

40
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:16,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

41
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I do that in Minecraft either

42
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:51,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

43
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,526
[SPEAKER_04]: $25 doesn't last as long as it used to.

44
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,346
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.

45
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:58,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in a place that's loaded with crane games where you're blowing through dollar bills like that.

46
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the slot machines in Vegas.

47
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I just spent $20.

48
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That's faster than dollar bills at a drag show.

49
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:09,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I would feel better with the crane games if the claw...

50
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:31,677
[SPEAKER_04]: clearly didn't pick up the object every single time but like it like I was just joking with my kids it's like you know just loosely grabbing like with like your hand fell asleep and you're like trying to grab something with it like that's what it was like every time it would pick up the thing but it's like oh I just have no strength I just dropped it oh no it's like

51
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:32,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

52
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:36,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't... It's like I'm not completely clueless to what's going on here.

53
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm gonna... You need to try the crane games there.

54
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually won things at other round ones.

55
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna... I've won one there, too.

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I won a shark one time, but I wanted a stupid cat that was big.

57
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, they're not gonna let that go away free.

58
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:55,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, I picked up the thing that you're supposed to pick up, like, five times in a row, and it's like, each time, nah.

59
00:04:56,451 --> 00:05:01,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, I'm not gonna grip it hard enough because, you know, that's how the game's programmed.

60
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:07,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to combine the crane idea with something that DarkSakura just said about dollar bills.

61
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:12,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think next Daddy's Day, Loki, we're going to take you to a drag brunch to celebrate.

62
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:14,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be the thing.

63
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guess what?

64
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:20,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, they're going to be doing a drag brunch at my work.

65
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:22,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they really?

66
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:22,900
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.

67
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because Pride season.

68
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:26,246
[SPEAKER_06]: For Pride Month.

69
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:26,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cute.

70
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:33,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going, the thing is, is that I know the main show queen.

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:40,855
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our local owner of clubs tearing through you.

73
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:42,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them perform before.

75
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:44,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

76
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wish, though, that my other friends were performing.

77
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be funny just to go like, so now you know where I work.

78
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:52,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I

79
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:53,488
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

80
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Pod Culture in chat says, are round one closed?

81
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:16,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else kind of like it is going into space.

82
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hear often about round ones closing.

83
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were doing pretty well as an organization.

84
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that's just, you know, an anomaly or what.

85
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:25,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very curious about that.

86
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

87
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:48,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I see reestablishing because they used to have a big office there.

88
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they have a small office, but I think they laid off a bunch of people and relocated.

89
00:06:51,882 --> 00:07:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But to hear that Nintendo's going to be doing the equivalent of what they have at the Rockefeller Center in San Francisco Union Square, I'm very excited about that.

90
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:01,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So, very cool.

91
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:02,988
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be nice.

92
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, is there a queen named Bacon Galore out there?

93
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:08,552
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, there should be.

94
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:12,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think Loki would ever do Dragon his life, but if he did, he's got a name.

95
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:13,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

96
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,836
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Petalettis.

97
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,202
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd be surprised.

98
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:19,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Pet is also a really good queen.

99
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacon Galore could also be taking us a 420 name because it could be B-A-K-I-N Bacon Galore.

100
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:39,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so for my daddy's day, I went out with some friends today, my GPS gaming group, because today is actually a Pikmin Bloom 10,000 step day, so we were walking around doing that.

101
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But we went out for Mexican, because we were like, what restaurant is not going to be bombarded today?

102
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,140
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, let's go to the Mexican joint, because usually the Mexican places in the AM are not super packed.

103
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were right, and I got to have chilaquiles for breakfast.

104
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:54,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Except the only problem when I eat chilaquiles...

105
00:07:56,536 --> 00:08:05,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like my mouth turns red like I've dyed my beard and it looks like I fucking like ate strawberry shortcake alive or something.

106
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:10,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my beard is just like swimming in red because of all the salsa.

107
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:12,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

108
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent the day trying to forget it exists.

109
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:15,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a bad day for me.

110
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:16,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

111
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:17,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

112
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

113
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:42,984
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway all right let's get into some sorry Deft if I made you hungry all right SSJ100 Matt I love this throwing up drag names they're uh baking my bits baking my bits I like that I would see her I would who would play her I mean you know I have a drag name right uh it would be the same sister would it be the same as your nun name yeah have a kiki yeah

114
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you, you know mine too.

115
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:46,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is Dale Satan.

116
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:49,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Dale and then S-A-Y-T-O-N.

117
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Dale Satan.

118
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great.

119
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,115
[SPEAKER_02]: My drag sister would be Gale Hydra.

120
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:04,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel for like a drag name regarding begging, you have to fit Hormel in there somewhere just because it sounds like whore.

121
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, no, that's your name!

122
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:07,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Hormel!

123
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:24,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't doubt if it's been done I mean we do we have Jenny Talia exists Dixie Normus exists I mean there's a there's some pretty fun ones out there but my favorite in the universe is Karen from Finance

124
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,913
[SPEAKER_06]: who is an Australian queen that I got to meet a few years ago.

125
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:31,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you really want to, no, hold on, hold on.

126
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:37,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you really wanted to go like the 420 and bacon like combo there, you could do bacon blitz.

127
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:41,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

128
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:41,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bacon.

129
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:42,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

130
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:42,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

131
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:51,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear the drag name Karen from Finance Now without hearing that new David Guetta song in my mind that goes, I need a man in finance.

132
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:52,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Six foot five.

133
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:54,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a man in finance.

134
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:59,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw some TikTok with that song playing, but it was Tom Nook.

135
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:01,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

136
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:02,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

137
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:12,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, there's just... Do you know that there is a Wikipedia article that's just called List of Drag Queens?

138
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:13,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure.

139
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:29,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, or every time there's a season of Drag Race coming, they have, like, all the... Somebody on Reddit, because Reddit, has found every drag queen in the country and, like, who stopped doing Instagram updates as of a certain date.

140
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:31,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jeez.

141
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,918
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they figure out who's on Drag Race.

142
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, all right.

143
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,454
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of unserious topics tonight, but let's be real.

144
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:44,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a little bit of a lighter Newsweek because we had a pretty heavy Newsweek last week.

145
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:49,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, all the announcements came out and now it's just, you know, leftovers and all that stuff.

146
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:55,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which does that because believe it or not, it is a video gaming show occasionally.

147
00:10:57,345 --> 00:11:00,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get into some stories starting off with this one, Loki.

148
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:10,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear, I see these advertisements on Facebook all the time talking about class action lawsuit against Valve, class action lawsuit against Humble Bundle.

149
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Nintendo.

150
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:14,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I want to sue them?

151
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,874
[SPEAKER_04]: They've offered me lots of games for dirt cheap.

152
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,376
[SPEAKER_04]: What possibly could I gain from this?

153
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:22,117
[SPEAKER_04]: People love money.

154
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, for sure.

155
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a class action lawsuit in the UK regarding essentially saying that there's

156
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:41,573
[SPEAKER_04]: price parity obligations with listing your games on Steam, which is true.

157
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:44,115
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a thing that actually happens.

158
00:11:45,176 --> 00:12:00,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I know myself and Aaron have dealt with that regarding, like, for example, if you put a game on sale someplace else, like, say, Itch or something like that, you have to also put it on sale in...

159
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam.

160
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:15,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're saying, well, you know, well, this platform, if it takes less of a cut and you want to lower the price of the game so that because, you know, they all take a 30% cut, you can't because Valve is going to want you to lower the price there.

161
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And so because of that class action lawsuit, right?

162
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:23,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's dumb.

163
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:28,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, honestly, they're trying to sue them for $838 million over these price restrictions.

164
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:45,246
[SPEAKER_04]: cool, good luck I mean, I think it's ridiculous Valve has a really nice marketplace with Steam I mean, certainly there are other options when it comes to competitive pricing and stuff like that, I don't know

165
00:12:47,724 --> 00:13:08,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid Amazon does the same thing though, I thought they were infamous for doing the same thing So, I mean, I'm not saying maybe this type of corporate behavior shouldn't be explored I think there is something to it, although I would think this would be Well, okay, I'm sorry, this is the publishers, or the makers of the games, right?

166
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be the publishers, yeah Sorry, you planted something in my head talking about the Facebook thing I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

167
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:24,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, maybe, because it could be in the sense that they feel that the consumers are due money back because it was cheaper or it could have been cheaper.

168
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, hypothetically, I don't know.

169
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems ridiculous.

170
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:33,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But according to this, they're saying that the company has overcharged 14 million British customers.

171
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:55,626
[SPEAKER_04]: is what they're throwing that out there because of these price parity obligations companies who hold a dominant position in the market are not allowed to charge excessive or anti-competitive prices I don't think that they do they also cannot impose other unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them

172
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:59,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with these types of agreements being looked at legally.

173
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a healthy thing to do.

174
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:07,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think the whole prospect of, and people will make money and profit off it, I think that's a little bit of a silly lost cause.

175
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:10,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be something, and I mean, let's be real anyway.

176
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:13,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Any money that's made, these lawyers are just going to eat up anyway.

177
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:24,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think realistically, the best you can hope for is that the rules would change moving forward, resulting in a more competitive and hopefully better type of marketplace for everybody.

178
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:25,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

179
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's just use this logic though here of the marketplace charging 30%.

180
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:35,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just flip it on its tail and go after the publishers now.

181
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:46,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, if you think about it, publishers that make games, or publish games I should say, they have a markup in there for retail.

182
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So they go out to retail and they mark up their games like, I think it was like 30% or so.

183
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:53,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially...

184
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:59,089
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

185
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:42,024
[SPEAKER_04]: but now games are being sold digitally so technically that margin that they were giving retail is not really needed by these first party publishers so are they overcharging their customers I mean yes they are but are they overcharging their customers you can make the same argument there as well because they're selling their games first party or they're selling their games through like Sony's marketplace or something like that but still having that same markup in there you know not necessarily I don't think anybody's

186
00:15:42,885 --> 00:16:06,351
[SPEAKER_04]: some people might reduce the cost of their game based off of the percentage that they're making from there but I mean if it's an indie studio honestly I would think that they would be just enjoying that extra bit of a margin on their games because games don't have a huge margin anyways even digitally especially for indie studios where you're not really selling tons and tons and tons of

187
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:07,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

188
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:29,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do feel like ultimately this ends up going nowhere.

189
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:34,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this ends up going exactly the route of a lot of those things you see on Facebook and it's going nowhere.

190
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is an interesting question for the industry to ask itself.

191
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:42,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Could these sorts of deals end up hurting things?

192
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

193
00:16:44,843 --> 00:17:10,063
[SPEAKER_02]: some comments in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network S2100 Matt says so the payout will be 20 euro for everyone yeah 20 euro to split amongst the million people in the lawsuit yes that's how these things tend to work yeah it'll be like that and then the lawyers will actually take that 20 they'll take 19 of those 20 euro up front so it'll be one steam key for World of Goo that you have like 50 copies of already yay

194
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:17,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Except World of Goo is actually kind of a good game, but I think everybody probably owns it through one way or another.

195
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been in like every Humble Bundle ever made.

196
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:20,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's funny.

197
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:21,842
All right.

198
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:23,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Super Meat Boy.

199
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,067
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

200
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:30,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Free Steam keys for World of Goo, Super Meat Boy, and VVVVV.

201
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:38,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week?

202
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:40,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I would crack up if somebody's been playing one of those games this week.

203
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

204
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:43,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, every week we talk about the games we've been playing this week.

205
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

206
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:51,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, um, I played, um, Baldur's Gate 3 quite a bit.

207
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:58,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I basically just had this wild urge just to have Astarion separate from the rest of the group and rob everyone blind.

208
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:03,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I kept making safe states to see all this shit I could steal.

209
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:03,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty funny.

210
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,980
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that part where you're given the wyvern poison and I stole it first.

211
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was pretty funny.

212
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:17,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I, of course, played Dead by Daylight.

213
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:22,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally, last night I would have played Castlevania Symphony of the Night, but I wanted to do the...

214
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the event.

215
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I need to play that.

216
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:46,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and if anyone is in my Discord, which I keep a lock on, but I do have posted all of the codes that have come out, and there are a lot of them, and if you want them in an easy-to-find place, you can also look at Polyester's last couple of videos on YouTube.

217
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

218
00:18:47,280 --> 00:19:14,461
[SPEAKER_06]: but um there there's a bunch of uh those little stickers you know that go with your banner the charm not like like a real charm I mean there are the charms too but they've renewed all of the uh pride flags and added a few more um they're like they also did the year four and year five anniversary crowns if you do party hats 24 there's some uh I like this one dndbd20

219
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:20,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to get a Mimic and a D20.

220
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:21,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cute.

221
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:22,467
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you get the pun?

222
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:25,750
[SPEAKER_06]: You have D&D, we have DBD, and then we have D20.

223
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

224
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cute.

225
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:37,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, my favorite one, though, it gives you 129,415 blood points, and it's, what is a man?

226
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,162
[SPEAKER_02]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

227
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:41,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Has somebody tried that code?

228
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

229
00:19:43,100 --> 00:20:06,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt it but you know there's also like Proud David, Proud Susie, 100k Slay, Intersectionality Yay so I mean there's really um the new flags that they've put up this year are um they did the Polly flag, the Demi flag, the Arrow flag, the Two Spirit flag um uh there is also the uh

230
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:10,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the pan flag is still up.

231
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:12,700
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a polyamory flag.

232
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,863
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a bunch of the flags and made them available for everybody.

233
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's also those little stickers for it as well.

234
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:22,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

235
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:28,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you're playing DVD, go look for those codes.

236
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:30,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely, they're doing lots of stuff.

237
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:35,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus, I played the new thing, and everyone's like, oh, the killers are being stinky.

238
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,136
[SPEAKER_06]: They're being stinky.

239
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:40,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had some stinkies, but we also had some people who were just farming the tomes.

240
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was fun.

241
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:49,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Our last game of the night was, and I am going to steal a term, a cumagorgon.

242
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,168
[SPEAKER_06]: The demogorgon covered in the white shit.

243
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:55,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

244
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Disgusting.

245
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,063
[SPEAKER_06]: For people who don't know, I'm just saying.

246
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:00,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

247
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was being a very good boy and we were helping them get their hooks and we were getting our achievements done and just having fun running around.

248
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:15,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are my favorite kind of games, especially after you've had some kind of stinky super comp games.

249
00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:19,139
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just, you know, it was a good one to end on.

250
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,480
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be proud of me, Jamie.

251
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I played one game of Dead by Daylight this week.

252
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:24,061
[SPEAKER_02]: One.

253
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a killer.

254
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:29,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a ghosty match.

255
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:34,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And I almost backed out because I saw there was a P100 in the lobby and I was like, oh god.

256
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:35,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

257
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a 4K.

258
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And on Haddonfield.

259
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

260
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:41,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the kitty mask for Ghostface?

261
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, I won it.

262
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:43,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

263
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:46,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been very into playing Ghostface lately.

264
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:46,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

265
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:54,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have adapted Aestri, the elven bard, who is tall!

266
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:59,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Aestri could probably go nose-to-nose with the Huntress.

267
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:00,965
[SPEAKER_06]: They're that tall.

268
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,026
[SPEAKER_06]: She is, I should say.

269
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:06,347
[SPEAKER_06]: But she also switches out with a male body, too.

270
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,428
[SPEAKER_06]: But elves are tall, so I guess it works out.

271
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,049
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have not done Vecna yet.

272
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,230
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really...

273
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:22,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy going against a Vecna now, even though they can be kind of stinky, because it's super fun when you can get the hand in the eye of Vecna.

274
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the items are great.

275
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you gotten the hand yet?

276
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:30,593
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't really played a lot, to be honest.

277
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:42,120
[SPEAKER_06]: The hand is cool, because when you get the hand, you can basically, if you have a full health state, if you're at perfect health, you can go into a locker and sacrifice a health state to teleport to another locker.

278
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fun.

279
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And then imagine me with my self-care and botany knowledge.

280
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:50,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, boom, heal, boom, heal.

281
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:51,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so much fun.

282
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:52,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved it.

283
00:22:53,508 --> 00:23:16,140
[SPEAKER_06]: um and and the underground part for the new level is absolutely beautiful when you get to the um the astrology lab it's really beautiful I think that they they knocked it out of the park with this one even if they since you know did some pretty terrible things to loyal employees yeah all right um well that's it for your gaming week let's go to Loki your gaming week

284
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:22,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So this week, I played mostly Minecraft, or I've been doing stuff in Minecraft.

285
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:25,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We had our stream day yesterday, so that was fun.

286
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:28,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Did a little bit of restocking shops and stuff.

287
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:34,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I, like I said, went to round one today, so I played a few things there.

288
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole ton.

289
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:39,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I played more Groove Coaster, because I always have to play Groove Coaster.

290
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:47,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a thing that they've added called Space Invader Games.

291
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Giga B, I think?

292
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:54,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, uh... You know how they have the big Space Invader?

293
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:56,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's an even bigger Space Invader game.

294
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:57,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good!

295
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bigger and, like, widescreen and on, like, a projection thing now, and it's huge, and you play with, like...

296
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's like at least four players in that.

297
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:09,767
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculously huge.

298
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:22,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tried that and then I played a Fast and Furious racing game which is also weird because it had like two widescreens that were stacked on top of each other so you have like a giant 4x3 screen almost that you played on.

299
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:24,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

300
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:25,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

301
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:30,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And then yeah the crane game that wouldn't give me a stupid cat.

302
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:30,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

303
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,695
[SPEAKER_04]: and I wasted a lot of money doing that.

304
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:36,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was a waste of money, but whatever.

305
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope you still had a good day around one.

306
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:42,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, they've added Dance Maniacs is there now.

307
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not Dance Maniacs.

308
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:46,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Step Maniacs.

309
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I always get the names confused.

310
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:48,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

311
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:49,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hear they were getting one of those.

312
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Step Maniacs is there.

313
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like, was it Beat Mania 31 or something?

314
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:55,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

315
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:55,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost count.

316
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:56,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't keep track of it.

317
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,462
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a DDR Gold Cab there now and an

318
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:04,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Ace, like another non-gold cab, like Ace 3 or something like that.

319
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know that world is rolling out now.

320
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:09,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some posts on socials about that.

321
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we'll get it since we have a gold cab, right?

322
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean, because I think that's gum in the gold cabs.

323
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:17,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Wish we had Dance Rush, but we don't.

324
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have Pump?

325
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:20,702
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they've had Pump it up.

326
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of moved, they moved things around a little bit.

327
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:27,524
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of like packed it even, you know, pushed it more into the corner a little bit.

328
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:28,224
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

329
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:30,325
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

330
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:34,428
[SPEAKER_02]: For my gaming week, honestly, it's been most of the same stuff I usually talk about.

331
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:37,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Diablo 4, just making progress on the latest season.

332
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,773
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an XP buff right now, so I'm trying to make the most of it.

333
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:41,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've gotten past level 50.

334
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm all the way up to 62 at this point.

335
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:49,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll probably keep playing after the show tonight and throughout the week, because that buff is only through the 20th.

336
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So I only have a few more days to make as much use out of it as I can.

337
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I'm playing a sorcerer right now.

338
00:25:54,861 --> 00:26:00,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I switched to a ball lightning build and they are, which is a very, it's almost a mean build at this point because it's pretty powerful for sorcerers.

339
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:02,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a lot of fun and very satisfying.

340
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:06,364
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest problem with it right now is my mana regen is not quite there.

341
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:17,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pretty much always have to pop a resource potion to make myself like not constantly run out of mana, but, um, it's working, you know, and as I level up and make my way around the Paragon grid, the mana regen will get better.

342
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:18,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.

343
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:19,987
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

344
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,864
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think I'm insufferable talking about the same games now, just wait.

345
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:40,527
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be Final Fantasy XIV and nothing but for a few weeks.

346
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:44,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And then still a little World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria remix.

347
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:48,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I did a stream of that actually on Monday for a little bit because Shane was able to play with me for a bit.

348
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did some of that.

349
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:10,592
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was still fun but for me that's probably going to be winding down when Dawn Trail comes out but it was I had a lot of fun and I hope WoW does something similar like that in the future to be honest but for the rest of you who know that your summer is going to get lost to Final Fantasy XIV that event still has another like 60 days in it so I think it's

350
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:39,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes right up until the next WoW expansion launches or maybe like the week before to help your characters because it's the easiest way to level up an alt right now like if you're buying a boost right now in World of Warcraft apologies but you're a fool right now because that Pandaria remix you can do the same thing very fast so now's the time to level all those alts if you're interested in that WoW expansion which I'll play at some point but it's not

351
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortnite Fortnite Fortnite Fortnite

352
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Forknife.

353
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:10,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Lego Fortnite is getting some updates soon, so they're adding some more difficulty modes, kind of going in both directions with that.

354
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:15,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have a cozy mode that they're going to add that kind of walks players through the game.

355
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Bobby Blackwolf mode!

356
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:17,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

357
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:29,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then it makes the enemies easier, it takes out some of the survival elements like hunger, temperature, stamina, friendly fire, that type of stuff.

358
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:31,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Bobby's installing Forknife as we speak.

359
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:45,448
[SPEAKER_04]: and then on the opposite end of the spectrum there they have expert mode which also makes everything a lot harder and enables permadeath mode Bobby is uninstalling fork knife as we speak yes

360
00:28:46,862 --> 00:28:57,506
[SPEAKER_04]: and then there's also a new totem of return item that will allow you to respawn back at your bed with your backpack and you have to unlock the recipe in the game to get that.

361
00:28:57,526 --> 00:29:02,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like the totem of undying in Minecraft.

362
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:05,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't really messed around with LEGO Fortnite, have you?

363
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:05,969
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have not.

364
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:11,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want the sets.

365
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to build this stuff.

366
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,293
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want those actual LEGO sets to come out?

367
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:18,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want the LEGO sets.

368
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,615
[SPEAKER_02]: That will absolutely be a thing, I'm sure.

369
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be a thing at some point, yeah.

370
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:23,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually.

371
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:25,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's actually really fun.

372
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played it a little bit.

373
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:27,597
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun little game.

374
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:28,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a really...

375
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:39,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that Fortnite is, you know, we've talked about this on the show in depth, I won't bore us again, but I like that Fortnite is more than just Battle Royale at this point.

376
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:41,660
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other interesting modes in it.

377
00:29:42,557 --> 00:30:09,091
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah it's pretty cool to see what they're doing with that I would like to see more I mean I know that they have their kind of like different tiers like one of them being a chorus so we'll get into here uh you know the music side of the things with Fortnite Festival um but it'd be cool to see like other games that even made by external publishers kind of oh I'm sure that's highlighted as well well and um isn't isn't the racing mode done by an external publisher

378
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, technically it's one they own though, isn't it?

379
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:17,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's done by the folks that did Rocket League, which is their company.

380
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who bought who.

381
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:28,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew Harmonix did the, which I know Epic infamously bought them, but yeah.

382
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:32,137
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Fortnite Festival is getting a Metallica crossover event.

383
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:35,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, times have changed, Metallica.

384
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,962
[SPEAKER_04]: From suing people that download your music to

385
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:40,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Being in Fortnite.

386
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:40,854
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fun.

387
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:46,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they liked how memed their Napster lawsuits became.

388
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:59,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they really like that they are forever associated with it at the same time you made your bad lie in it, but I feel like I've read these interviews where they actually get really irritated whenever the Napster shit is brought up at this point.

389
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:02,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like they could have done something or nothing.

390
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,291
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I guess, an option as well.

391
00:31:04,371 --> 00:31:08,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But they had to, you know, charge forward with dumb shit.

392
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they get treated like, you know, this.

393
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:17,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it is well within the right to, you know, defend their copyright.

394
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,840
[SPEAKER_04]: By all means, you know, you can do that.

395
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pick your battles, I guess.

396
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, don't be upset when people associate you with that.

397
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:27,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

398
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:29,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Down the road.

399
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:30,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Too fucking bad.

400
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:31,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, don't care.

401
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:39,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Barbra Streisand has a whole internet effect named after her, so... I mean...

402
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:42,779
[SPEAKER_04]: You make poor choices that are monumentally disliked.

403
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,419
[SPEAKER_02]: She probably had nothing to do with that.

404
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,440
[SPEAKER_02]: She personally probably had nothing to do with that.

405
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And that whole thing.

406
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:49,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably her lawyers, her agents.

407
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:51,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Lawyers here too.

408
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:54,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But pick better lawyers than I guess.

409
00:31:55,984 --> 00:31:58,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So Fortnite is getting Metallica songs.

410
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:04,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be adding six new Metallica tracks to buy and play, including Enter Sandman, Fuel, Ride, The Lightning, and others.

411
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:32,687
[SPEAKER_04]: and then also they're going to allow you to even access a premium track as well including Metallica's One as part of their festival pass and then even along with that they're going to be adding Metallica themed tracks and cars in the racing portion and in LEGO Fortnite LEGO versions of Metallica as well

412
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:34,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something.

413
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:37,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Holographic Metallica in the Battle Royale.

414
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Metallica everywhere.

415
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

416
00:32:44,056 --> 00:32:50,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, they're getting so old IRL, they've got to have these virtual versions that last forever, right?

417
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:53,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

418
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:53,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

419
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,580
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

420
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Fortnite isn't of interest to you, maybe something that Ubisoft is putting together is of interest to you.

421
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:04,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Prince of Persia, whenever that comes out, the Sands of Time remake.

422
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:06,002
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ubisoft.

423
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:06,002
2026.

424
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

425
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:14,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ubisoft Forward happened this week, and they gave some announcements and some updates on some things that they're working on.

426
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:19,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of in line with some other not E3 events we were talking about on last week's show.

427
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,966
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

428
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:45,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, at least they'll date that even if they won't date Beyond Good and Evil 2.

429
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:47,854
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that one has a date.

430
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

431
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they went into some more gameplay for Assassin's Creed Shadows which looks terrible.

432
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:55,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

433
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Assassin's Creed.

434
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: What the terrible portion about it is the writing.

435
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:06,339
[SPEAKER_04]: The dialogue that they had in game is not good.

436
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:10,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like I was almost ready for them to go like...

437
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:12,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, let's go!

438
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just about that cringe at this point.

439
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:20,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not written well, is the problem.

440
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:23,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also the music with it, too.

441
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:25,308
[SPEAKER_04]: They have trap music along with it.

442
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't look good.

443
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we also got an update on the City Builder series.

444
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pronounce this wrong because I've never played this.

445
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:36,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Anno?

446
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say Anno.

447
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:39,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

448
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, no.

449
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:47,193
[SPEAKER_02]: 117 Pax Romana is going to be the new entry that's going to be in the series.

450
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:49,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to do the Ancient Roman Empire.

451
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

452
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,198
[SPEAKER_02]: PC, Xbox, PS5, all that good stuff.

453
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:55,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't hate on this because this is actually a pretty rad Prince of Persia game.

454
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lost Crown is going to be getting some DLC.

455
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:00,425
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the Metroidvania one that came out earlier this year.

456
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:04,669
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a free content update that happened as well with some new outfits, amulets.

457
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:07,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Some new platforming challenges called the Divine Trials.

458
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be some DLC coming.

459
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Mask of Darkness is the name of the DLC.

460
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dated for September.

461
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:21,652
[SPEAKER_02]: The Prince of Persia, the Temple of Fire update is going to be adding content to the roguelike take on the franchise.

462
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:24,113
[SPEAKER_02]: They hit early access earlier this year.

463
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:29,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if there is a genre, Ubisoft is willing to slap the Ubisoft name on, or excuse me, the...

464
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Ubisoft is willing to slap the Prince of Persia name on it and have it sell more copies.

465
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:38,677
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you should be excited about this one.

466
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:42,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, The Skybreaker.

467
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:43,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally!

468
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:46,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Story DLC coming to Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

469
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming on July 16th and it's part of the game's season pass.

470
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to assume that is something DarkSakura will stream.

471
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:55,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I already have because I got the Ultimate Edition.

472
00:35:55,964 --> 00:35:56,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

473
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,025
[SPEAKER_02]: You have more stuff to look forward to in July.

474
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Well good, that means I can go back to streaming it.

475
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:06,583
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Defiance Season 1 starts on July 2nd.

476
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,885
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is in pre-season right now.

477
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, a game I've never played.

478
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:18,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Skull & Bones, this was the quadruple A title, if I remember right.

479
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:25,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Season 2, the Chorus of Havoc is underway, and it's going to be new things to face off against.

480
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The Brig, a new ship, limited time boat race events.

481
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:35,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Fleet Management is coming soon, and then Season 3 will be called Into the Dragon's Wake.

482
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:36,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you all enjoy that.

483
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,126
[SPEAKER_02]: The Crew Motor Fest Year 2 has a map.

484
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:50,209
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole other year of content in the driving game that you're probably playing if you're into the crew because the original was shut down, as we've talked about a lot on this show.

485
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Crew Motor Fest is still going with a whole second year of content.

486
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was pretty much it.

487
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:01,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, yeah, the new Star Wars game obviously has a lot of attention.

488
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:07,249
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I noticed even in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, DarkDetsuya says the Star Wars game seems really cool.

489
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And QuestBuster says, I'm hoping it'll be good.

490
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:12,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always wanted an open world Star Wars game.

491
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:15,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think, you know, there's a reason why they spent most of their time talking about that.

492
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one they want to drive pre-orders for.

493
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:18,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.

494
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:21,462
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

495
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:23,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch that live, Loki?

496
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:23,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

497
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:24,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

498
00:37:24,484 --> 00:37:25,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

499
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:25,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like...

500
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:50,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the it was boring those yeah those company events they always have not been as good when they are after Sony and Microsoft because all the announcements end up in those and then they're just left with like updates and they don't it's very rare you might get like a uh indie-esque sort of reveal or something but that's that's it usually with that well I mean like I didn't

501
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:54,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they didn't show Just Dance, so that's a positive, I guess.

502
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:57,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a Just Dance game coming out this year?

503
00:37:57,757 --> 00:37:58,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

504
00:37:58,938 --> 00:37:59,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

505
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume so.

506
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't do that.

507
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: But they still played music from all these other games.

508
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:12,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, Skull & Bones, they're doing updates and stuff like that and talking about the big community and everything.

509
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:13,325
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is trash.

510
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:15,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolute trash and it's awful.

511
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And the gameplay is awful.

512
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:20,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that they're putting all this DLC out there for it.

513
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:37,159
[SPEAKER_04]: like I think I even some of the comments people were talking about they're like yeah that was a ship that they showed off initially that they cut from the game that they were bringing back to the game now and it I don't know I wouldn't I wouldn't spend any more time with that game if I were the folks playing that or that played that initially but

514
00:38:38,680 --> 00:39:03,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Wars looks okay certainly getting Far Cry vibes from it especially like when they're showing you targeting different enemies on the map like being able to spot them and then make them highlighted on the maps or in your HUD as you're playing and stuff so that it's kind of samey but it looks good I mean so at least there's that but yeah Skull and Bones stay away from that crap

515
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I will point out so I had to research I was like where's Just Dance so Just Dance 2024 is actually the game that came out in 2023 so we would be looking for Just Dance 2025 but even the official Twitter account or just I was so desperate for information I went to Twitter uh even the official account there does not it's still promoting uh season three of Just Dance 2024 with a Katy Perry song and pretty much everything that I google is a bunch of clickbait like

516
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:37,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my fan song list, fan made edition, fan guesses, release date guesses.

517
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that crap that, you know, is nothing to do with official news.

518
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:43,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have official news on Just Dance 2025.

519
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:45,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be something that they...

520
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about later, like, there's still Gamescom, and they're, you know, a French company, so... Or Nintendo Direct.

521
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,625
[SPEAKER_02]: They often get tied with Nintendo, so it could be something they announce on Nintendo Direct.

522
00:39:55,685 --> 00:40:01,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Nintendo Direct, or it could just be, like... I could even see them... Because, like, honestly, like...

523
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:05,641
[SPEAKER_04]: How much are they really improving with the gameplay for this?

524
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:10,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It could just be one of those... It's the same thing, but it'll get much... Actually, that's a perfect example.

525
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:10,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

526
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:14,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a perfect example of why... Do you remember when that Nintendo Direct leak was going around last week?

527
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:16,767
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one of these every week, yes.

528
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:24,751
[SPEAKER_02]: But I say one way you can always look at these things with a critical eye is that the leak lists often are always too good to be true.

529
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:26,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I scroll back and forth, alright.

530
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:51,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance VR, Welcome to Dance City.

531
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:56,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they skipping a regular one to do a VR one?

532
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:56,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

533
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:59,585
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming to MetaQuest on October 15th.

534
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:04,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

535
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,407
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still time.

536
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:09,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like we need to know.

537
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:15,631
[SPEAKER_02]: If Gamescom and a Nintendo Direct go by and we still haven't heard, then that's the cause for the Just Dance fans to be concerned.

538
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:16,411
[SPEAKER_02]: All does know you.

539
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:16,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

540
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Dance Lore Just Dance Lore

541
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Something going on.

542
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:45,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm not going to mock the game.

543
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:46,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

544
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:58,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, to me, feeling, you know, I honestly, I would not want to mock a game like this because it feels like someone making fun of, like, Dance Dance Revolution or something like that.

545
00:41:58,211 --> 00:41:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

546
00:41:58,452 --> 00:41:58,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

547
00:41:58,692 --> 00:41:59,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bite the hand that feeds.

548
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:00,715
[SPEAKER_04]: No, exactly.

549
00:42:00,815 --> 00:42:02,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not mocking the game itself.

550
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:06,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I will mock their presentation of having the dancers out there to announce the game every year.

551
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:07,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That is cringe.

552
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:11,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will mock their aggressive monetization schemes in the game.

553
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,370
[SPEAKER_02]: That I will mock as well.

554
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: That as well.

555
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, I would not... The game itself is solid.

556
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:16,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun game.

557
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:18,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played it, like,

558
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:22,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember which one it was a long time ago, but it's fun.

559
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a fun game.

560
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:27,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool that there's rhythm in music games out there still.

561
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:36,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all willing to support that, but also Ubisoft with all their drama and mismanagement and stuff like that.

562
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:40,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to get nasty grams this week?

563
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:41,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fuck it.

564
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:47,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to remind everybody my birthday's coming up, so you're not allowed to send me, and it's Pride Month, so you're not allowed to send me hate mail.

565
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I would argue Just Dance isn't really a rhythm game.

566
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:56,841
[SPEAKER_02]: and the reason it's a learning choreography game.

567
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:59,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Simon Says choreography repetition game.

568
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,783
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it really is to me.

569
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:02,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what it is.

570
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:03,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

571
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:04,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

572
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:12,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a choreography game because you're not really doing beat matching or anything like that and it's always the same thing over and over.

573
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily there's so much interpretation.

574
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:16,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like Parapara to be honest.

575
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:18,434
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like Dance Central.

576
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:20,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Dance Central.

577
00:43:20,054 --> 00:43:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a fun game.

578
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:24,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?

579
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:24,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

580
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:28,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

581
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:29,638
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an ally right there.

582
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:31,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

583
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

584
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:36,640
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how about sequels that we want to games, DarkSakura?

585
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:52,464
[SPEAKER_06]: well how about something from Yacht Club Games how about a new Shovel Knight yes to that so it is in development they are working on

586
00:43:53,445 --> 00:44:13,705
[SPEAKER_06]: improving and innovating some of the mechanics but want it to be like a new adventure something that's going to actually add and contribute and expand on the universe they don't have everything ready to unveil yet but they say look for it

587
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:18,976
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep hinting with this specific quote.

588
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:23,619
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep saying that it will launch Subtle Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.

589
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:24,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 3D game.

590
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a 3D platformer.

591
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:27,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee it.

592
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:28,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

593
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:40,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, to me, all that is, if I have my Magic 8-Ball, and y'all know my predictions are decent sometimes, perfect Nintendo Direct announcement.

594
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:42,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect Nintendo Direct announcement.

595
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:43,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

596
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:44,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

597
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:48,010
[SPEAKER_06]: They know what we want and it's not 3D.

598
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:55,485
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they did a Shovel Knight game in the style of Mega Man Legends?

599
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:59,786
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I want it to be a Shovel Knight game, not a Mega Man Legends game.

600
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me a trailer.

601
00:45:03,427 --> 00:45:06,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I can't judge anything until I see a trailer.

602
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:11,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Because maybe it's one of those 2D games that kind of flips into 3D or a 2D game rendered in 3D.

603
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:12,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me a trailer.

604
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:12,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

605
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:13,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, Loki.

606
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:14,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

607
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:14,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

608
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:23,922
[SPEAKER_04]: People are mad.

609
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:25,063
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

610
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:25,743
[SPEAKER_04]: People are mad?

611
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:27,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, people are mad.

612
00:45:27,745 --> 00:45:28,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same.

613
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Gamers?

614
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:30,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Mad?

615
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,889
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's a tale as old as time when it comes to Bethesda.

616
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this week we had the Starfield creation toolkit, I believe, come out.

617
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:49,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Allowing folks to essentially be able to create mods for Starfield, which is a good thing.

618
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,924
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad thing is, you know, Bethesda being Bethesda and selling mods on their marketplace.

619
00:45:57,644 --> 00:46:03,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, one of the things they announced, I think this was the one at the Xbox event, was...

620
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:10,734
[SPEAKER_04]: This special Trackers Alliance The Vulture, which was a bounty hunter event.

621
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:14,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, it's like one mission that you could buy.

622
00:46:15,218 --> 00:46:15,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's $7.

623
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,620
[SPEAKER_04]: But guess what?

624
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:19,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only buy credits in $10 increments.

625
00:46:21,684 --> 00:46:21,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Great!

626
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:49,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also other things you can buy for $10 including just some decorative elements to put in your spaceships and outposts or $3 worth of that kind of stuff for an in-game plushie So of course people have been review bombing this because they said putting mods behind a paywall is a big no for me Creators Club is a scam So yeah

627
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,256
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't like it.

628
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

629
00:46:54,917 --> 00:47:24,257
[SPEAKER_02]: uh well yeah I mean the whole concept of paid mods is interesting to me but I then I think I think back to like the CD-ROM era when CD-ROMs were all the rage and you remember like when you could buy Duke Nukem 3D on CD-ROM and it came with like 20 2800 different versions of Duke Nukem those are all mods that was kind of like a way of doing paid mods in a way um it feels like you know a different era yeah I don't know plus when you had so many

630
00:47:25,157 --> 00:47:26,038
[SPEAKER_02]: for one cost.

631
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:27,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like a deal, right?

632
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:28,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, exactly.

633
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's think about that.

634
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were probably those discs.

635
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:37,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I have purchased those discs before, and they were great.

636
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:42,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It was essentially... This is back in the day when there wasn't a high-speed internet.

637
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:45,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just all dial-up.

638
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:51,815
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just download... You could try to download these through AOL or something like that, but it would take...

639
00:47:52,495 --> 00:48:16,480
[SPEAKER_04]: forever and then storing it and stuff so they would sell map packs and you would pay like it was probably like 20 bucks maybe upwards of 50 dollars but you're getting like hundreds of maps and fast forward to 2024 where Bethesda is offering you one mission for seven dollars yeah like I'm sorry no inflation's not that bad

640
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:20,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

641
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get it.

642
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

643
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:32,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Their excuse is like, well, we developed this in-house or we're allowing authors to sell their mods if they want.

644
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:34,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's cool.

645
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:42,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just say don't buy these and just play other free mods.

646
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:44,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's other free mods that are out there.

647
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:45,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everything is paid.

648
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:46,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can...

649
00:48:48,052 --> 00:49:14,766
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, play the other stuff, like this is probably not worth it for $7 anyways, I guarantee that if it's a mission created by Bethesda, it's probably not worth it, their missions kind of suck sometimes especially in like Starfield where a lot of the stuff is really buggy or like we're talking about the Radiant missions that are just churning the same, oh collect this, go do this, go do that, you know, and it's kind of annoying, but I don't know, just vote with your wallet

650
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:44,260
[SPEAKER_04]: apparently enough people voted with their wallet in Skyrim that they thought that this was a great idea or Fallout 76, I mean there's no modding in Fallout 76, well maybe there is but Fallout 4, you know I'm sure they have the same thing there where enough people buy it, they're going to do it again or they figure like, oh they're going to make us think about it now but if we keep it in here long enough they're just going to forget about it and go on to the next thing people that don't know better will plunk down the money yep

651
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:50,649
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, Jamie, I know you have no problem plunking down the money for this game coming up.

652
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're excited about, right?

653
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:55,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you have no idea.

654
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been watching the trailers.

655
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:03,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been watching the gameplay demonstrations.

656
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:09,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I really have been looking forward to Dragon Age The Veil Guard for like some time.

657
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:34,968
[SPEAKER_06]: the bit that they showed was like going to find Solas and stop what he was doing and the new characters are pretty cool I'd have to say it's definitely it's basically set in the Tevinter area which we've just heard of for a while and haven't really had much going on in that area

658
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:43,885
[SPEAKER_06]: and it looks like a lot of the action is going right off of Inquisition so I like that.

659
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:58,648
[SPEAKER_06]: The characters they've shown already are fantastic because of course we have Varric and we got to and Scout Harding is there and there's a mage named Nev who is absolutely fantastic.

660
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:00,428
[SPEAKER_06]: She's just

661
00:51:02,037 --> 00:51:02,658
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the shit.

662
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:03,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to leave it that way.

663
00:51:03,618 --> 00:51:04,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the character.

664
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:22,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really just like the dialogue going on in-game is good and it just really feels connected and live and not just nothing is happening while you're just running around.

665
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:24,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very... The banter is great.

666
00:51:24,973 --> 00:51:26,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's just like so much.

667
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:27,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And it...

668
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:55,172
[SPEAKER_06]: it does sort of like have a feel of watching like maybe a well not really like a mobile game but some of that same just sort of you know move from A to B to A to B just really fast but I think that I like it you know I'm looking forward to it they say it's going to be sometime fall of this year we'll see when that is

669
00:51:56,243 --> 00:52:21,237
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i gotta say um you know i really enjoy the art style in this and i'm gonna admit like dragon age um was kind of a game that i'm i'm i've always been a little bit more meh on this series i enjoyed inquisition enough i wasn't as into it as i was say mass effect so when they announced this game you know and it's you know because what it went from being you know the next dragon age to being dragon age uh dread wolf

670
00:52:21,457 --> 00:52:23,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dread Wolf, and now it's the Veil Guard.

671
00:52:23,379 --> 00:52:26,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've been kind of like, meh, meh, meh.

672
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:29,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even that trailer they put out was a little bit meh to me.

673
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:34,687
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that I've seen this gameplay video, yeah, oh, this character's fierce as fuck.

674
00:52:35,348 --> 00:52:37,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we're watching gameplay if you're live on Twitch.

675
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing some of the trailer.

676
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's fierce.

677
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I like her.

678
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:46,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just have to say, when I watch this, I really like the art style, and it is so fucking fluid.

679
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:47,953
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I really notice.

680
00:52:48,094 --> 00:52:54,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, is it really going to run this well on a PS5 or a Series X or a high-end computer?

681
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Because damn.

682
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,397
[SPEAKER_06]: On a computer, absolutely.

683
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:03,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, with solid state drives and everything, maybe it is like, you know, being able to reduce loading time, just make everything so fluid.

684
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:05,625
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, this just looks bomb.

685
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:10,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And like just the minimal combat I've seen with Rook and, you know, moving the swords around.

686
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that just looks really fun.

687
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:20,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I would, this game went from being kind of a meh on my radar to being like, oh, fuck, I think I kind of want to play this real bad, actually.

688
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:20,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

689
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:48,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been reading the comics ever since the first game there'd be the in-between comics there's some really good ones for post-Inquisition but I like that you can really tell in Varric and Harding looks kind of like the same as she always has but Varric looks like he does in the comics in the last series of comics that came out so they're keeping the character styles consistent throughout the entire franchise yeah

690
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:51,645
[SPEAKER_06]: and that to me definitely means something.

691
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:53,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see some characters come back.

692
00:53:53,587 --> 00:54:04,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently one of the a couple of the customization things is for one of them is customizing your Inquisitor

693
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:27,010
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think it's going to be like an Inquisition where your Hawk from Dragon Age 2 came back I would love to of course even though his voice actor is a dick I would love to see Cullen come back I would love to see Alistair come back I want to see some of those old faces you know but I like when they bring them back and they're like

694
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:28,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yay, they're here!

695
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:31,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And not a, they're gonna take over the game!

696
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,131
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

697
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just, oh, it's a cameo in the background, but it plays into the game in a meaningful fashion.

698
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the kind of...

699
00:54:42,689 --> 00:54:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what that Dragon Age gameplay thing has me even more hyped for now is whatever's coming next for Mass Effect because I'm like if Dragon Age looks that good like Mass Effect and they're going back to our universe with our Shepard apparently like I'm really excited about the next Mass Effect to be honest

700
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:13,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad I saved every last one of my damn save files I still have one float around on my Xbox because remember I played the trilogy originally on Xbox 360 I had those save file editors Was it Xbox 360 or Xbox One?

701
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:17,701
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it was the 360 actually It was that long ago

702
00:55:19,905 --> 00:55:25,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I saved all the stuff for my old PC and my Parallels install when I was trying to play it.

703
00:55:25,648 --> 00:55:31,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I might actually have to see if Parallels will run better now and see if I can play some of the games again.

704
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:38,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the old save editor worked at least for Mass Effect 2 and 3.

705
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:43,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the remakes.

706
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, you know, and I still need to really give the remakes a good try.

707
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:53,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I played a bit of the first one, but I really need to sit down and take the time.

708
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:56,057
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so hard when there's so many games that never quit.

709
00:55:57,782 --> 00:55:59,083
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I get it.

710
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:00,004
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

711
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:05,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, another company trying to get our attention with latest and greatest games, Capcom.

712
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:09,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So Capcom recently did a fan survey.

713
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:10,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been going on for a few months.

714
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:12,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we got some results.

715
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this feels a little repetitive to me because I was like, I thought we saw some results from this.

716
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:25,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tweet is from this week where Capcom actually put out, here are the fan vote results of what the biggest...

717
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:28,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Franchises are in various countries.

718
00:56:28,866 --> 00:56:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe this was, I think the other one was what franchise, that's what it was.

719
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:35,690
[SPEAKER_02]: What franchises do you want to see come back?

720
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:38,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is what's like your favorite.

721
00:56:39,392 --> 00:56:44,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So for Japan, the results were number one, Monster Hunter.

722
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:47,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, Mega Man, Rockman.

723
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:50,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, Ace Attorney.

724
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:54,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil, Street Fighters, and Capcom Mega Man is still number 2

725
00:57:14,575 --> 00:57:16,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But then Devil May Cry is actually number three.

726
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:21,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Hunter is not until you get to number four, but I think we always knew that Monster Hunter was pretty big in Japan.

727
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:25,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, you keep on going down the list.

728
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Dino Crisis, Street Fighter.

729
00:57:26,647 --> 00:57:28,229
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't seem right.

730
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:29,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem right.

731
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,131
[SPEAKER_02]: The fans rigged the voting.

732
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:36,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter is number seven, which shows you how well received Street Fighter V was, I guess.

733
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:37,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But

734
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:56,577
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 is pretty good, I thought, so I don't know Dino Crisis is not more popular than Street Fighter, I'm sorry At the same time It's just stupid It's a fucking fan poll and maybe we need to not read into it too seriously But it is interesting when the company itself endorses and kind of speaks on it So that's why I'm mentioning it

735
00:57:57,257 --> 00:58:23,714
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know I'm sure Capcom takes that stuff under under advisement it is nice to see Mega Man coming in at number two because it really shows that like we want more Mega Man games we haven't had one in a little while I mean we've had kind of re-releases and you know the Game Boy ones just showed up on the Nintendo you know archives and all that but yeah very curious to see if they end up doing another full Mega Man game all right let's move on Loki

736
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:25,528
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

737
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:33,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's some updates coming to the PlayStation 5, including Discord support.

738
00:58:33,831 --> 00:58:43,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So now using your console, you're actually going to be able to connect directly to Discord, much like the Xbox platform has been able to do for a while now.

739
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:45,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, cross-platform play Discord.

740
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:50,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're probably already doing it anyways, but now you can do it with your actual console.

741
00:58:50,476 --> 00:58:51,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

742
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:51,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

743
00:58:54,093 --> 00:59:02,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they had some, but you had to go through your phone and all that complicated shit before, so it's nice that this is going to be directly built in.

744
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,597
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long overdue, to be honest.

745
00:59:04,717 --> 00:59:05,057
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

746
00:59:05,577 --> 00:59:10,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is an interesting sort of partnership that has occurred in the mobile space.

747
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:13,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many of you have ever heard of the app BeReal.

748
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:22,344
[SPEAKER_02]: BeReal is an app that I think came out a couple years ago, and it's kind of like a Snapchat or an Instagram story, might be a better way to put it.

749
00:59:22,904 --> 00:59:27,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, I've never used it, but I've heard of other people using it.

750
00:59:27,988 --> 00:59:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point during the day, it says it's time to be real.

751
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're supposed to snap a picture and your front and back cameras go off at the same time.

752
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:45,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have like two minutes to respond to the toast pop up because it's supposed to be like, what is everybody doing exactly at this moment?

753
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,082
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like undoctored, unposed.

754
00:59:48,462 --> 00:59:52,165
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's its way of kind of needling Instagram is that it's real, right?

755
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:52,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever.

756
00:59:53,225 --> 00:59:56,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it's not that real, but real enough, I guess.

757
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:03,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So BeReal was huge, but there apparently are still a lot of people that are using it.

758
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:08,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And a game publisher named Voodoo has bought them.

759
01:00:08,889 --> 01:00:10,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Voodoo is also in the mobile space.

760
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,731
[SPEAKER_02]: They do free-to-play mobile titles that often have a lot of ads.

761
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the one you know the most is Hole.io.

762
01:00:20,092 --> 01:00:28,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Donut County, which was the actual indie game, but there was Whole.io, which was the same concept.

763
01:00:28,275 --> 01:00:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: The Whole.io, that's just such a nicely named name.

764
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:37,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So much thought put into it, just as much thought as they stole the original concept.

765
01:00:37,538 --> 01:00:41,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they took the whole concept and made it its own thing.

766
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:44,700
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, what's that?

767
01:00:45,506 --> 01:00:46,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, of course they did.

768
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:14,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Itself has kind of died down in popularity because what happened?

769
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:17,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram and TikTok made the same gimmick at some point.

770
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:22,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, but it's still going, I guess.

771
01:01:23,656 --> 01:01:31,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Voodoo in talking about Be Real says there are 40 million active users, but that's not necessarily daily active users.

772
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:34,720
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just probably people that haven't closed their accounts over the years.

773
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So interesting kind of alliance there.

774
01:01:40,103 --> 01:01:49,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, we will go to our next segment and travel back to a time when there was no mobile app alignment.

775
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cameras did not take the quality pictures they take today.

776
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:54,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very different time.

777
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to... Your camera attached to your Game Boy.

778
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:59,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a camera attached to your Game Boy with a shitty little printer.

779
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:01,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

780
01:02:12,546 --> 01:02:19,812
[SPEAKER_05]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

781
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:22,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

782
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:25,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did you pick this week, DarkSakura?

783
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:27,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked a game called Gunner's Heaven.

784
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also known as Rapid Reload in Europe.

785
01:02:34,008 --> 01:02:44,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So the game, and I actually got the idea because Dan and I were watching some stuff on Gunstar Heroes and then this playthrough came up and I was like, oh, that's a neat one.

786
01:02:46,198 --> 01:02:55,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a run and gun game that was created by Media.Vision and published by Sony for the PlayStation in Japan and Europe in 1995.

787
01:02:56,346 --> 01:03:00,569
[SPEAKER_06]: It was re-released on PSN in Japan in 2007 and in Asia in 2010.

788
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:32,411
[SPEAKER_06]: it has been very much compared to Gunstar Heroes by Treasure you can choose to play either Axel the dude or Ruka the lady through six different levels and you can switch with four different weapons from a machine pistol, a flamethrower, a homing laser or a multi-directional cannon each character has their own set of four weapons so you can get a total of eight depending on who you're playing

789
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:49,291
[SPEAKER_06]: you also have a grappling hook you can also do aiming by holding R2 on the controller you can throw your enemies in different directions just like how Red and Blue can in Gunstar Heroes

790
01:03:50,492 --> 01:04:16,862
[SPEAKER_06]: you have a point system in the game which you collect the points that are dropped by your enemies and then when you collect them you have a counter that increases and will start counting down the more that you collect the weapons will also become more powerful and then you can find a booster that will temporarily increase your weapon strength it's like

791
01:04:17,722 --> 01:04:25,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the nuke of the game, but that timer is going to go back down again while you're using the booster.

792
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: There, like I said, was six stages, and there are one or two sub-bosses and then the true boss.

793
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:37,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released in Europe and Japan, but not in North America.

794
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: The rumor is that Sony's thing against releasing 2D games for PlayStation in the US was the reasoning.

795
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:55,055
[SPEAKER_06]: it got from Famicom it got a 26 wait, I can't make words happen, I swear Famicom Tsushin gave it a 26 out of 40

796
01:04:58,448 --> 01:05:20,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Hamitsu gave it a 27 out of 40 in the US Next Generation reviewed the Japanese version as an import and gave it a 4 out of 5 but it was a very enjoyable game and it really was well enjoyed but often said not as good as Gunstar Heroes

797
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: so it doesn't have the simultaneous two-player that Gunstar has and especially the PAL version was considered to be very sloppy the footage that we're watching is from the Japanese version but yeah it's a

798
01:05:43,577 --> 01:05:44,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have come out over here.

799
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:46,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do feel that it should have.

800
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:47,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would have sold wonderfully.

801
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:58,783
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can see, even just in some of the animation, the character style, that it looks not too far off than Gunstar Heroes.

802
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:06,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a quick and short one, but I thought that it would be a good one to bring up and put on people's radars.

803
01:06:06,645 --> 01:06:08,226
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy a copy for about $175.

804
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:08,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that all?

805
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:17,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, considering what the market is like now, that's practically a steal in some cases.

806
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:18,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I gotcha.

807
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:23,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

808
01:06:24,862 --> 01:06:51,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid Reload or Gunner's Heaven that's it alright let's get back to it and we have just a few more segments for you and then we're you know what we don't have a lot of news stories left to be honest so if we you want to call in you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord and we'll check on our mailbag to participate at orange launch radio dot com first let's do some rapid fire news Loki

809
01:06:52,639 --> 01:07:01,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they spend very much time waiting to implement mods into Doom based off of the new Doom trailer because now we have the Shield Saw.

810
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Shield Saw is a mod that's for the original Doom that essentially replaces the Chainsaw with the Shield Saw model as seen in the Doom Dark Ages trailer.

811
01:07:14,749 --> 01:07:17,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually check that out.

812
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:25,837
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a video online, you can check it out through, it shows like the first level of Doom 2, playing through that, and it looks awesome.

813
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:35,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they are, I don't know if they're doing anything else with that, they're actually modding levels and stuff, but yeah, it's neat.

814
01:07:37,418 --> 01:07:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura

815
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:07,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, okay, I just like completely misheard that.

816
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:10,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about Parasol Stars, the story of Bubble Bobble 3?

817
01:08:12,751 --> 01:08:23,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on July 11th for 10 Bones or 10 Yettos.

[SPEAKER_06]: it's Parasol Stars don't know what else I can say about it it's cute and you have Parasols and you jump around and you defeat cute enemies yeah Parasol Stars and Rainbow Islands never get as much love as the original Bubble Bobble and they deserve it I love Parasol Stars they're great but Rainbow Islands to me is quite the different game with similar stuff I like Parasol Stars though fair

820
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

821
01:09:18,662 --> 01:09:23,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a story for you, too, and it's about the Until Dawn movie adaptation.

822
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:26,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know some of the cast that's going to be in the movie.

823
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nobody that was in the game.

824
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:32,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be a different cast of people all together.

825
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:33,862
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

826
01:09:59,422 --> 01:10:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, or excuse me, Sitting in Bar with Cake.

827
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the people that have signed on to the movie.

828
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:10,892
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie will be about eight young adults who have to get through the night because they are being hunted by a killer.

829
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,395
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't, I don't think

830
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:16,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to mirror the game.

831
01:10:17,056 --> 01:10:23,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it is going to be like in the same universe, but it's not going to be like this person's playing this character, you know, from the game and so on and so on.

832
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:31,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember when the game was made, there were some pretty familiar faces in there, including Rami Malek was in the actual game.

833
01:10:31,422 --> 01:10:34,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayden Pantier, the girl from Heroes.

834
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:38,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Hayden Pantier.

835
01:10:38,585 --> 01:10:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, was in that game as well.

836
01:10:40,906 --> 01:10:44,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, they had some big names of the time there.

837
01:10:45,322 --> 01:10:46,063
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

838
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:07,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, cause you know, Hayden Pentonier, is that her name?

839
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Was in Scream 6, you might remember.

840
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:14,602
[SPEAKER_02]: She brought her character back and she's just, she's not a teenager anymore, which is, which is fine.

841
01:11:14,642 --> 01:11:15,463
[SPEAKER_02]: People age, right?

842
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens, right?

843
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:17,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But she's, you know, she's not a teenager anymore.

844
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:19,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

845
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:26,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's move on and check out world release dates and some games that are coming out, uh, in a country near you.

846
01:11:26,606 --> 01:11:27,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with the U.S.

856
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:42,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see PC on there.

857
01:12:42,996 --> 01:12:43,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.

858
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:09,242
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry, that's a Europe date sneaking its way onto my list.

859
01:13:09,262 --> 01:13:11,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is it for Japan next week.

860
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:12,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's it for the Switch.

861
01:13:12,664 --> 01:13:13,604
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's look at the PlayStation 5.

862
01:13:14,624 --> 01:13:23,588
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 5 has that Mushoku Tensei Jobless Reincarnation Quest to Memories is out on the PlayStation 5, as is Rusted Moss.

863
01:13:23,668 --> 01:13:29,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But just those two games coming to PlayStation 5 this week in Japan, all on the 20th of June.

864
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:31,632
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how about Europe?

865
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:48,957
[SPEAKER_06]: so for the UK on the 18th for PlayStation we have Still Wakes the Deep for PlayStation and Xbox we have Police Simulator Patrol Officers Gold Edition on the 20th for Switch Windstorm and Unexpected Arrival PlayStation we have Five Nights at Freddy's Help 102

866
01:13:50,798 --> 01:13:56,440
[SPEAKER_06]: We have on the 21st... Is that still this week?

867
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:56,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.

868
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:57,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.

869
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Fight his way.

870
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:58,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

871
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:03,122
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Elden Ring, Shadow of the Urge Tree for PlayStation and Xbox.

872
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my husband's excited about that one.

873
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,804
[SPEAKER_02]: He's getting his character in Elden Ring all prepped for it, so...

874
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a lot of friends playing Elden Ring lately for the same reason.

875
01:14:14,151 --> 01:14:16,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get worse next week, but I get it.

876
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:16,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

877
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:28,807
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, when I was going through the Japanese releases, DJ Ranma S in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network said, Mushoku Tensei, that anime is so good, pointing out to another question in chat.

878
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:30,428
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to watch it, it is on Crunchyroll.

879
01:14:31,349 --> 01:14:31,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

880
01:14:32,671 --> 01:14:33,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

881
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:34,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And DJ Ranma S knows his anime.

882
01:14:36,032 --> 01:14:36,352
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

883
01:14:36,812 --> 01:14:40,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, believe it or not, we've covered all the news we're going to cover this week.

884
01:14:40,712 --> 01:14:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a little bit lighter in the news department.

885
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:47,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I will, as always, of course, before we get to... I don't think we have any emails, but I'll check anyway.

886
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:50,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check with Loki, see if we have any last-minute stories.

887
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:51,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

888
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:52,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

889
01:14:53,915 --> 01:14:54,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighter week, isn't it?

890
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:56,635
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, do we get any emails?

891
01:14:56,715 --> 01:14:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate at OrangeLunchRadio.com?

892
01:14:58,576 --> 01:14:58,676
[SPEAKER_06]: One.

893
01:14:59,276 --> 01:14:59,356
[SPEAKER_02]: One?

894
01:14:59,456 --> 01:14:59,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

895
01:14:59,876 --> 01:15:00,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's do it.

896
01:15:01,741 --> 01:15:05,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so this is from Mishi.

897
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:07,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi y'all, it's your girl Mishi here.

898
01:15:07,922 --> 01:15:09,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question for you all.

899
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:13,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was watching the Ubisoft Forward and I noticed there was an interpreter for ASL.

900
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,964
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also one on Disney, I believe, too.

901
01:15:16,084 --> 01:15:23,146
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, since they used one during the presentation, do you think this will ever be implemented in video games as well?

902
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be something cool to see used for, say, kids who can't read

903
01:15:28,627 --> 01:15:30,748
[SPEAKER_06]: yet well are those who are learning ASL.

904
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:31,609
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts?

905
01:15:31,649 --> 01:15:33,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Always happy gaming and have a good one.

906
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, Michi Kintz.

907
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:37,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually can answer some very significant questions about this.

908
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

909
01:15:38,874 --> 01:15:56,085
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, the dialogue in game, they will usually provide the subtitles instead of having an interpreter because if you think about it, they would have to animate and render an interpreter to stay on screen.

910
01:15:57,449 --> 01:16:01,050
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really going to be realistic.

911
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:17,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be easier to have a person in the room with them signing as opposed to having a specific set of a character with skins and set animations and making it look believable.

912
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:22,575
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that too, a big component of ASL is facial expression.

913
01:16:23,235 --> 01:16:26,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't gather that perfectly from

914
01:16:27,656 --> 01:16:56,956
[SPEAKER_06]: a 3D model you can get close but sometimes it's going to be lost and then on top of that you're also dealing with regional differences in ASL British ASL and American ASL for example are different so for example if you were saying in English the man jumped off the building in ASL you would set up the building first then establish the man and then have him fall off of it whereas British ASL to my sorry BSL to my memory

915
01:16:57,336 --> 01:17:00,139
[SPEAKER_06]: would set it up in standard sentence structure.

916
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're dealing... My uncle's an interpreter, by the way, and a speech pathologist.

917
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:21,617
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some, like Bobby was saying just now, where a character in-game may communicate in ASL, but having an interpretation...

918
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:26,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Available non-stop, you know, like the little interpreter in the bottom of the screen that you see.

919
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:28,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not going to be realistic.

920
01:17:28,962 --> 01:17:33,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, unless a developer wants to take that initiative and make it happen.

921
01:17:33,724 --> 01:17:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not going to say I don't want it to happen because I would love for something like that to happen.

922
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:42,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I do want to point out, there is a recent game that did it.

923
01:17:43,588 --> 01:17:44,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Forza Horizon 5.

924
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:52,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Forza Horizon 5 actually did incorporate ASL, but it is, you know, and DarkSakura's pretty much outlined the reasons why you don't see it very often.

925
01:17:52,617 --> 01:17:56,541
[SPEAKER_02]: A developer really has to go out of their way to do it and put that support in there.

926
01:17:56,601 --> 01:18:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, Forza Horizon is one, 5 specifically in recent memory, that did it.

927
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:12,734
[SPEAKER_02]: All I can really find, I was trying to look for gameplay that showed it in action, and all I could really find was the Microsoft sizzle reel that kind of shows it in action, but they show a little bit about how that's kind of all working.

928
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: As you watch this video, it's, again, more them trying to promote it, but you do see some instances mixed in this video here where they actually, you can see what the sign language kind of looks like there.

929
01:18:22,361 --> 01:18:22,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's lying.

930
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:23,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I said but.

931
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:25,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I know.

932
01:18:25,643 --> 01:18:26,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to go into it.

933
01:18:26,924 --> 01:18:27,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

934
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:28,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

935
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:29,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

936
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:31,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But at any rate, yeah.

937
01:18:33,894 --> 01:18:40,299
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the way, I'm sorry, just happy pride to this guy in the shirt that's signing bear.

938
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:46,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say happy pride to the bear guy in the Forza Horizon 5 video and him only.

939
01:18:47,464 --> 01:18:48,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down for that.

940
01:18:48,405 --> 01:18:49,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down for that.

941
01:18:50,006 --> 01:18:54,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing actually I want to throw in there too is regional sign language idioms.

942
01:18:54,349 --> 01:18:54,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

943
01:18:56,087 --> 01:19:17,491
[SPEAKER_06]: so there are those things too one of my favorite ones it's a fairly universal I'm gonna see if I can get my little avatar to do it it's gonna be hard is you're sitting one arm on top and the other arm on the bottom and you throw up horns on one and the other hand I can't get it to show up is doing like it's it's a sign for bullshit

944
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:22,239
[SPEAKER_06]: One hand is pooping out and the other one is the horns on the head.

945
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:23,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're together.

946
01:19:25,188 --> 01:19:26,332
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's one of my favorite ones.

947
01:19:27,386 --> 01:19:28,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question, though.

948
01:19:29,968 --> 01:19:30,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.

949
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:32,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.

950
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:41,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and something the industry, yeah, I think DarkSakura, you give a lot of good, like, realistic sort of like, here's why it's hard to do and so forth.

951
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:49,602
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's when you see a game like Forza Horizon 5 or Moss, you know, many people in the chat talking about that, too, that does that.

952
01:19:50,282 --> 01:19:57,248
[SPEAKER_02]: In a game, it just makes it all that much more like, wow, they really want to make sure their game is seen and played by as many people as possible.

953
01:19:57,268 --> 01:19:58,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes that very special.

954
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:08,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that on average, with some of the games that are released, they are intended for a certain age group that's expected to have a certain degree of literacy.

955
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:09,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

956
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:31,113
[SPEAKER_06]: so I'm just gonna throw that out there but but I think though that for certain other games though they would benefit for something like that you know especially if it's for the younger viewers younger players um speaking of oh go ahead I just think I wouldn't mind seeing something like that happen

957
01:20:32,154 --> 01:20:47,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of accessibility, I think I've brought this up on the show before, but I just want to make sure people know this now because we've been asked about this in the past, and it is something that used to be something that was prohibitively expensive, and that is transcripts of this program.

958
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:54,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you have the ability to actually read through and see the words on the screen and all that of this program online?

959
01:20:55,162 --> 01:21:00,884
[SPEAKER_02]: which in the past has been very expensive to do because services would charge by the minute and so forth.

960
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:06,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I would love that if we had that type of income, if we had those sorts of investors behind us.

961
01:21:06,826 --> 01:21:07,286
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't.

962
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:10,427
[SPEAKER_02]: We're operated out of our homes in our spare time.

963
01:21:10,467 --> 01:21:11,568
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have that kind of budget.

964
01:21:11,668 --> 01:21:14,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks to more modern tools, that is available.

965
01:21:15,049 --> 01:21:16,329
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

966
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:38,735
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

967
01:21:56,773 --> 01:22:00,094
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

968
01:22:27,383 --> 01:22:30,724
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that's available for those that want to venture through that.

969
01:22:31,465 --> 01:22:32,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's great.

970
01:22:32,565 --> 01:22:33,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for it.

971
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:34,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

972
01:22:35,126 --> 01:22:40,568
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, now someone can read all about dying in a boat fire on an ocean of piss.

973
01:22:40,828 --> 01:22:45,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as I think we've compared certain game experiences to in the past.

974
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:48,702
[SPEAKER_02]: What game was that?

975
01:22:48,963 --> 01:22:51,084
[SPEAKER_02]: We were saying.

976
01:22:51,504 --> 01:22:52,564
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also another one.

977
01:22:53,245 --> 01:22:54,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pissing in an ocean of piss.

978
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:56,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that was a thing.

979
01:22:57,887 --> 01:22:58,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

980
01:23:00,046 --> 01:23:01,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to search the transcripts.

981
01:23:01,987 --> 01:23:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

982
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's it for Lister Roundtable.

983
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:11,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to call out, if you have an email for a future week, participate at orange.trader.com is the place to do it.

984
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that, we're at the end of the show.

985
01:23:13,915 --> 01:23:16,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a little shorter tonight, but that's the way the news is, and that's fine.

986
01:23:17,457 --> 01:23:21,640
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a few long episodes in the last couple weeks, so we're going to wrap it up for tonight.

987
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:22,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, uh

988
01:23:51,269 --> 01:23:51,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

989
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have thoughts anymore.

990
01:23:53,991 --> 01:23:58,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one rollercoaster motion to the other followed by copious amounts of sleep.

991
01:24:00,194 --> 01:24:00,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Mood!

992
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:04,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky, because I slept maybe four hours on Friday night, but that's alright.

993
01:24:04,317 --> 01:24:04,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens.

994
01:24:06,558 --> 01:24:20,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, just I would love for just everyone to take one moment out of your day on any day and take it for yourself and tell yourself

995
01:24:21,232 --> 01:24:50,438
[SPEAKER_06]: that you are that you have a place and that you should always just understand that there's a place for everybody in the world okay alright bye bye have a good stream Loki you're up next what's your final thought for us tonight I think I've gotten to a point where I have so many games in the humble bundle I don't know what's in my library and what's not in my library and I wish there was an easy way to determine that

996
01:24:51,232 --> 01:24:51,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Mood.

997
01:24:53,033 --> 01:24:55,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my final thought is, guess what, everybody?

998
01:24:56,134 --> 01:25:00,616
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S came through with me for a special request, so you're going to see that here momentarily.

999
01:25:01,076 --> 01:25:06,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that note, I hope you all have a very wonderful week, and we will be back in seven days to do this all over again.

1000
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so much, and happy Daddy's Day to all of you.
