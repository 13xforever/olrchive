39602	42385	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42445	46890	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47030	48992	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49052	52756	We are live once again tonight with episode number 1008 of our show tonight.
55379	70631	June 16th of 2024 as we broadcast live through the magic of Twitch television on our channel with our friends at VOG Network, where we tape it live every Sunday night, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
71712	74655	I am here, Rob Roberts, with my co-hosts who join me every week.
74775	77317	First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
80429	84692	And Jamie was having a mic issue before the show and I'm not sure Isn't it working now?
84792	93536	Yes, now it is, that's so weird I said hi I know, but the hi didn't come through, so it's weird Everything's broken Did that work?
93576	107484	Yes, that worked, yes, loud and clear, we heard that Alright, so Jamie will just be speaking in raspberries all night long Nah Who is the last person you blew raspberries at?
108545	108885	A cat
110538	112339	Mine would have been a Lexus driver, for sure.
118743	122985	Midna was doing her usual, I want to be fed, I've never been fed before.
123046	124266	And I was like, oh yeah.
125367	126668	And she didn't know what to make of that.
127288	136273	Why is it whenever I get cut off in traffic, it's always a Lexus, BMW, a Mercedes, or now a Tesla?
136553	138674	Why is it always one of those vehicles?
138694	139275	Entitled drivers.
140703	141884	No, I know the answer.
143465	150471	You named all of these semi-luxury brands and they're all entitled.
150951	152132	Oh, my car is expensive.
152172	155095	No one would dare run into me.
155255	157897	Watch me demolish my Fiat to make a point.
158437	160999	Watch next time you get cut off in traffic.
161079	164642	Make a note of the make and model of the car because you're going to notice some patterns.
164862	165183	Oh, no.
165603	166424	I just brake check them.
167825	168165	All right.
168393	173396	They do not want to have to deal with a fiat on their insurance.
175657	178679	Let's check the breaks on the one and only Techmaster Loki.
179619	179900	Hello.
180140	181120	Hey, how are you doing, Loki?
181901	182301	Pretty good.
183221	184862	Who was the last person you blew raspberries at?
184982	185903	Or, I guess, Animal.
188704	189425	I don't remember.
189765	190606	Okay, it's fine.
190626	194308	Are you insinuating my cat is not a people?
194368	195909	We'll just say something in Minecraft.
196069	196409	I don't know.
197881	199342	I don't think I do that in Minecraft either
229364	231105	I don't know.
231125	232526	$25 doesn't last as long as it used to.
232566	233346	No, it doesn't.
233606	238969	Especially in a place that's loaded with crane games where you're blowing through dollar bills like that.
239069	241030	It's like the slot machines in Vegas.
241090	243511	I can't believe I just spent $20.
243551	245372	That's faster than dollar bills at a drag show.
246153	249454	I would feel better with the crane games if the claw...
250475	271677	clearly didn't pick up the object every single time but like it like I was just joking with my kids it's like you know just loosely grabbing like with like your hand fell asleep and you're like trying to grab something with it like that's what it was like every time it would pick up the thing but it's like oh I just have no strength I just dropped it oh no it's like
272532	272832	Right.
273233	276575	Like, I can't... It's like I'm not completely clueless to what's going on here.
276836	278737	Well, I'm gonna... You need to try the crane games there.
278777	280418	I've actually won things at other round ones.
280879	282540	I'm gonna... I've won one there, too.
282560	286223	I won a shark one time, but I wanted a stupid cat that was big.
286924	289546	And, of course, they're not gonna let that go away free.
289646	295691	So, like, I picked up the thing that you're supposed to pick up, like, five times in a row, and it's like, each time, nah.
296451	301816	Nah, I'm not gonna grip it hard enough because, you know, that's how the game's programmed.
303252	307893	I'm going to combine the crane idea with something that DarkSakura just said about dollar bills.
307973	312755	And I think next Daddy's Day, Loki, we're going to take you to a drag brunch to celebrate.
312815	314035	I think that'll be the thing.
314315	317756	Hey, guess what?
318056	320817	Speaking of which, they're going to be doing a drag brunch at my work.
321397	322219	Are they really?
322359	322900	That's wild.
322980	324864	Oh, because Pride season.
324884	326246	For Pride Month.
326266	326928	Oh, that's cute.
327388	333420	And I'm going, the thing is, is that I know the main show queen.
333440	333901	Mm-hmm.
334688	340855	It's our local owner of clubs tearing through you.
341435	342756	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
342917	344178	I've seen them perform before.
344418	344698	Okay.
345099	348863	But I wish, though, that my other friends were performing.
349083	351946	It would be funny just to go like, so now you know where I work.
352226	352787	I feel like I
353147	353488	DarkSakura.com
371490	373993	Pod Culture in chat says, are round one closed?
374153	376215	Something else kind of like it is going into space.
376415	378818	I don't hear often about round ones closing.
378858	381862	I thought they were doing pretty well as an organization.
381962	384826	So I don't know if that's just, you know, an anomaly or what.
384866	385947	I'm very curious about that.
386227	387328	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
406078	408219	I see reestablishing because they used to have a big office there.
408279	411501	I don't know if they have a small office, but I think they laid off a bunch of people and relocated.
411882	420447	But to hear that Nintendo's going to be doing the equivalent of what they have at the Rockefeller Center in San Francisco Union Square, I'm very excited about that.
420647	421728	So, very cool.
422108	422988	That'll be nice.
423129	426851	SSJ100Matt says, is there a queen named Bacon Galore out there?
427371	428552	If not, there should be.
428632	432514	Well, I don't think Loki would ever do Dragon his life, but if he did, he's got a name.
432594	433175	Oh, come on.
433255	434836	We have Petalettis.
436561	438202	you'd be surprised.
438242	439463	Pet is also a really good queen.
440263	446647	Bacon Galore could also be taking us a 420 name because it could be B-A-K-I-N Bacon Galore.
448996	459158	Anyway, so for my daddy's day, I went out with some friends today, my GPS gaming group, because today is actually a Pikmin Bloom 10,000 step day, so we were walking around doing that.
459278	463859	But we went out for Mexican, because we were like, what restaurant is not going to be bombarded today?
463879	468140	We're like, let's go to the Mexican joint, because usually the Mexican places in the AM are not super packed.
468560	471561	And we were right, and I got to have chilaquiles for breakfast.
472301	474922	Except the only problem when I eat chilaquiles...
476536	485584	It's like my mouth turns red like I've dyed my beard and it looks like I fucking like ate strawberry shortcake alive or something.
485644	490488	Like my beard is just like swimming in red because of all the salsa.
491829	492210	I don't know.
492250	494111	I spent the day trying to forget it exists.
494191	495632	It's kind of a bad day for me.
496233	496793	I understand.
496834	497374	I understand.
497434	497634	But...
498993	522984	anyway all right let's get into some sorry Deft if I made you hungry all right SSJ100 Matt I love this throwing up drag names they're uh baking my bits baking my bits I like that I would see her I would who would play her I mean you know I have a drag name right uh it would be the same sister would it be the same as your nun name yeah have a kiki yeah
523803	525004	I told you, you know mine too.
525064	526205	Mine is Dale Satan.
526986	529408	Dale and then S-A-Y-T-O-N.
530830	531410	Dale Satan.
532291	533452	I think it's great.
533693	536115	My drag sister would be Gale Hydra.
538557	544623	I feel for like a drag name regarding begging, you have to fit Hormel in there somewhere just because it sounds like whore.
544643	545884	Oh my god, no, that's your name!
546165	547106	Hormel!
548852	564843	I wouldn't doubt if it's been done I mean we do we have Jenny Talia exists Dixie Normus exists I mean there's a there's some pretty fun ones out there but my favorite in the universe is Karen from Finance
566112	568913	who is an Australian queen that I got to meet a few years ago.
569293	571234	Now, if you really want to, no, hold on, hold on.
571254	577916	Now, if you really wanted to go like the 420 and bacon like combo there, you could do bacon blitz.
580697	581037	Okay.
581157	581657	Oh, bacon.
582037	582518	I get it.
582558	582958	I get it.
583718	591463	I can't hear the drag name Karen from Finance Now without hearing that new David Guetta song in my mind that goes, I need a man in finance.
591843	592664	Six foot five.
592824	594085	I need a man in finance.
594845	599508	Because I saw some TikTok with that song playing, but it was Tom Nook.
601009	601709	Oh my God.
601729	602550	Oh my God.
604884	612748	Well, I mean, there's just... Do you know that there is a Wikipedia article that's just called List of Drag Queens?
613288	613888	Oh, I'm sure.
614008	629936	Well, or every time there's a season of Drag Race coming, they have, like, all the... Somebody on Reddit, because Reddit, has found every drag queen in the country and, like, who stopped doing Instagram updates as of a certain date.
631197	631697	Oh, jeez.
631997	633918	That's how they figure out who's on Drag Race.
636010	637791	So anyway, all right.
638872	641454	A lot of unserious topics tonight, but let's be real.
641514	644956	It's been a little bit of a lighter Newsweek because we had a pretty heavy Newsweek last week.
645036	649279	So, you know, all the announcements came out and now it's just, you know, leftovers and all that stuff.
649339	655824	So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which does that because believe it or not, it is a video gaming show occasionally.
657345	660087	And we're going to get into some stories starting off with this one, Loki.
661004	670029	I swear, I see these advertisements on Facebook all the time talking about class action lawsuit against Valve, class action lawsuit against Humble Bundle.
670270	671350	Or Nintendo.
671891	674952	Why would I want to sue them?
675132	677874	They've offered me lots of games for dirt cheap.
678414	680376	What possibly could I gain from this?
680396	682117	People love money.
683210	684711	Yeah, I mean, for sure.
686171	694015	So there is a class action lawsuit in the UK regarding essentially saying that there's
695029	701573	price parity obligations with listing your games on Steam, which is true.
702294	704115	That is a thing that actually happens.
705176	720066	I know myself and Aaron have dealt with that regarding, like, for example, if you put a game on sale someplace else, like, say, Itch or something like that, you have to also put it on sale in...
722150	722530	Steam.
722590	735715	So they're saying, well, you know, well, this platform, if it takes less of a cut and you want to lower the price of the game so that because, you know, they all take a 30% cut, you can't because Valve is going to want you to lower the price there.
735735	739296	And so because of that class action lawsuit, right?
742917	743837	I think it's dumb.
744197	748959	Like, honestly, they're trying to sue them for $838 million over these price restrictions.
753021	765246	cool, good luck I mean, I think it's ridiculous Valve has a really nice marketplace with Steam I mean, certainly there are other options when it comes to competitive pricing and stuff like that, I don't know
767724	788399	It's stupid Amazon does the same thing though, I thought they were infamous for doing the same thing So, I mean, I'm not saying maybe this type of corporate behavior shouldn't be explored I think there is something to it, although I would think this would be Well, okay, I'm sorry, this is the publishers, or the makers of the games, right?
788600	793043	It would be the publishers, yeah Sorry, you planted something in my head talking about the Facebook thing I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah
793263	804007	Well, I mean, maybe, because it could be in the sense that they feel that the consumers are due money back because it was cheaper or it could have been cheaper.
804387	806227	Like, hypothetically, I don't know.
806307	807548	It seems ridiculous.
808128	813690	But according to this, they're saying that the company has overcharged 14 million British customers.
814530	835626	is what they're throwing that out there because of these price parity obligations companies who hold a dominant position in the market are not allowed to charge excessive or anti-competitive prices I don't think that they do they also cannot impose other unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them
837144	839885	I'm fine with these types of agreements being looked at legally.
840025	841685	I think that's a healthy thing to do.
841825	847606	But I just think the whole prospect of, and people will make money and profit off it, I think that's a little bit of a silly lost cause.
847946	850186	I think it would be something, and I mean, let's be real anyway.
850286	853007	Any money that's made, these lawyers are just going to eat up anyway.
853107	864949	So I think realistically, the best you can hope for is that the rules would change moving forward, resulting in a more competitive and hopefully better type of marketplace for everybody.
865009	865169	Yeah.
865709	870752	Okay, let's just use this logic though here of the marketplace charging 30%.
871772	875234	Let's just flip it on its tail and go after the publishers now.
875915	886961	So essentially, if you think about it, publishers that make games, or publish games I should say, they have a markup in there for retail.
887181	893264	So they go out to retail and they mark up their games like, I think it was like 30% or so.
893324	893885	So essentially...
894665	899089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
913143	942024	but now games are being sold digitally so technically that margin that they were giving retail is not really needed by these first party publishers so are they overcharging their customers I mean yes they are but are they overcharging their customers you can make the same argument there as well because they're selling their games first party or they're selling their games through like Sony's marketplace or something like that but still having that same markup in there you know not necessarily I don't think anybody's
942885	966351	some people might reduce the cost of their game based off of the percentage that they're making from there but I mean if it's an indie studio honestly I would think that they would be just enjoying that extra bit of a margin on their games because games don't have a huge margin anyways even digitally especially for indie studios where you're not really selling tons and tons and tons of
967071	967732	I don't know.
986598	989142	Well, I do feel like ultimately this ends up going nowhere.
989342	994609	I think this ends up going exactly the route of a lot of those things you see on Facebook and it's going nowhere.
994709	998475	But it is an interesting question for the industry to ask itself.
998855	1002020	Could these sorts of deals end up hurting things?
1002300	1002600	I don't know.
1004843	1030063	some comments in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network S2100 Matt says so the payout will be 20 euro for everyone yeah 20 euro to split amongst the million people in the lawsuit yes that's how these things tend to work yeah it'll be like that and then the lawyers will actually take that 20 they'll take 19 of those 20 euro up front so it'll be one steam key for World of Goo that you have like 50 copies of already yay
1031570	1037737	Except World of Goo is actually kind of a good game, but I think everybody probably owns it through one way or another.
1037757	1039659	It's been in like every Humble Bundle ever made.
1039699	1040621	Yeah, that's funny.
1041341	1041842	All right.
1042723	1043784	Yeah, Super Meat Boy.
1044125	1046067	There you go.
1046167	1050152	Free Steam keys for World of Goo, Super Meat Boy, and VVVVV.
1055784	1058026	Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week?
1058346	1060688	I would crack up if somebody's been playing one of those games this week.
1060708	1061068	We'll see.
1061088	1063450	Uh, every week we talk about the games we've been playing this week.
1063670	1064831	Uh, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1066733	1071556	Alright, um, I played, um, Baldur's Gate 3 quite a bit.
1072257	1078662	Um, I basically just had this wild urge just to have Astarion separate from the rest of the group and rob everyone blind.
1080157	1083198	I kept making safe states to see all this shit I could steal.
1083238	1083958	It was pretty funny.
1085719	1089980	There's that part where you're given the wyvern poison and I stole it first.
1091000	1092321	So it was pretty funny.
1094742	1097122	I, of course, played Dead by Daylight.
1097242	1102104	Normally, last night I would have played Castlevania Symphony of the Night, but I wanted to do the...
1103404	1105025	Um, the event.
1105826	1107167	Oh yeah, I need to play that.
1108027	1126240	So, and if anyone is in my Discord, which I keep a lock on, but I do have posted all of the codes that have come out, and there are a lot of them, and if you want them in an easy-to-find place, you can also look at Polyester's last couple of videos on YouTube.
1126440	1126580	Hmm.
1127280	1154461	but um there there's a bunch of uh those little stickers you know that go with your banner the charm not like like a real charm I mean there are the charms too but they've renewed all of the uh pride flags and added a few more um they're like they also did the year four and year five anniversary crowns if you do party hats 24 there's some uh I like this one dndbd20
1157483	1160105	It's to get a Mimic and a D20.
1161046	1161627	Oh, that's cute.
1161647	1162467	But do you get the pun?
1162607	1165750	You have D&D, we have DBD, and then we have D20.
1165770	1166050	Yep.
1166070	1168012	Oh, that's cute.
1168272	1177760	Also, my favorite one, though, it gives you 129,415 blood points, and it's, what is a man?
1178861	1180162	A miserable little pile of secrets.
1180182	1181123	Has somebody tried that code?
1181143	1181223	What?
1183100	1206911	I doubt it but you know there's also like Proud David, Proud Susie, 100k Slay, Intersectionality Yay so I mean there's really um the new flags that they've put up this year are um they did the Polly flag, the Demi flag, the Arrow flag, the Two Spirit flag um uh there is also the uh
1208297	1210158	Oh, the pan flag is still up.
1210278	1212700	There's a polyamory flag.
1212740	1216863	They did a bunch of the flags and made them available for everybody.
1217483	1221606	And then there's also those little stickers for it as well.
1222307	1222567	So...
1224208	1228111	Yeah, if you're playing DVD, go look for those codes.
1228331	1230993	It's absolutely, they're doing lots of stuff.
1231033	1235116	And plus, I played the new thing, and everyone's like, oh, the killers are being stinky.
1235156	1236136	They're being stinky.
1236216	1240139	Yeah, we had some stinkies, but we also had some people who were just farming the tomes.
1241480	1242561	And that was fun.
1243802	1249686	Our last game of the night was, and I am going to steal a term, a cumagorgon.
1251447	1253168	The demogorgon covered in the white shit.
1254639	1255500	Yeah.
1255920	1256561	Disgusting.
1256861	1259063	For people who don't know, I'm just saying.
1259643	1260564	Yeah.
1260684	1270532	But it was being a very good boy and we were helping them get their hooks and we were getting our achievements done and just having fun running around.
1270592	1275336	Those are my favorite kind of games, especially after you've had some kind of stinky super comp games.
1276237	1279139	These are just, you know, it was a good one to end on.
1280460	1281480	You should be proud of me, Jamie.
1281540	1283561	I played one game of Dead by Daylight this week.
1283961	1284061	One.
1284921	1286902	I played a killer.
1287522	1289423	I did a ghosty match.
1289863	1294024	And I almost backed out because I saw there was a P100 in the lobby and I was like, oh god.
1294964	1295605	I know, I know.
1295705	1296585	And I got a 4K.
1297665	1298505	And on Haddonfield.
1299006	1299406	Thank you very much.
1299426	1301426	Did you see the kitty mask for Ghostface?
1302227	1303367	Oh yes, I won it.
1303407	1303907	I don't know why.
1304747	1306208	I've been very into playing Ghostface lately.
1306528	1306688	So...
1307560	1314042	Well, I have adapted Aestri, the elven bard, who is tall!
1315203	1319945	Aestri could probably go nose-to-nose with the Huntress.
1320325	1320965	They're that tall.
1322205	1323026	She is, I should say.
1323246	1326347	But she also switches out with a male body, too.
1326467	1328428	But elves are tall, so I guess it works out.
1330488	1332049	But I have not done Vecna yet.
1333029	1334230	But I really...
1335257	1342868	Enjoy going against a Vecna now, even though they can be kind of stinky, because it's super fun when you can get the hand in the eye of Vecna.
1343469	1344630	Yeah, the items are great.
1345490	1346931	Have you gotten the hand yet?
1347231	1350593	No, I haven't really played a lot, to be honest.
1351273	1362120	The hand is cool, because when you get the hand, you can basically, if you have a full health state, if you're at perfect health, you can go into a locker and sacrifice a health state to teleport to another locker.
1362640	1363921	Yeah, fun.
1364601	1367103	And then imagine me with my self-care and botany knowledge.
1368443	1370585	I'm like, boom, heal, boom, heal.
1370645	1371965	It was so much fun.
1372025	1372566	I loved it.
1373508	1396140	um and and the underground part for the new level is absolutely beautiful when you get to the um the astrology lab it's really beautiful I think that they they knocked it out of the park with this one even if they since you know did some pretty terrible things to loyal employees yeah all right um well that's it for your gaming week let's go to Loki your gaming week
1397672	1402395	So this week, I played mostly Minecraft, or I've been doing stuff in Minecraft.
1402696	1405137	We had our stream day yesterday, so that was fun.
1405157	1408980	Did a little bit of restocking shops and stuff.
1410781	1414183	I, like I said, went to round one today, so I played a few things there.
1414363	1415084	Not a whole ton.
1416285	1419467	I played more Groove Coaster, because I always have to play Groove Coaster.
1421008	1427232	I played a thing that they've added called Space Invader Games.
1428629	1430531	Giga B, I think?
1431132	1434595	It's like, uh... You know how they have the big Space Invader?
1434675	1436957	Now it's an even bigger Space Invader game.
1436997	1437338	Oh, good!
1438619	1444185	It's bigger and, like, widescreen and on, like, a projection thing now, and it's huge, and you play with, like...
1446044	1448466	I think there's like at least four players in that.
1448626	1449767	It's ridiculously huge.
1450728	1462996	So I tried that and then I played a Fast and Furious racing game which is also weird because it had like two widescreens that were stacked on top of each other so you have like a giant 4x3 screen almost that you played on.
1464337	1464717	Interesting.
1464837	1465217	I don't know.
1467739	1470361	And then yeah the crane game that wouldn't give me a stupid cat.
1470381	1470921	Yeah.
1472034	1473695	and I wasted a lot of money doing that.
1474835	1476675	I knew it was a waste of money, but whatever.
1477136	1478596	Well, I hope you still had a good day around one.
1479656	1482497	Yeah, well, they've added Dance Maniacs is there now.
1483357	1484778	Or not Dance Maniacs.
1485158	1486638	Dance Step Maniacs.
1486918	1488299	Sorry, I always get the names confused.
1488319	1488679	Oh, that's right.
1488739	1489899	I did hear they were getting one of those.
1489959	1491060	Step Maniacs is there.
1491420	1494300	They have like, was it Beat Mania 31 or something?
1494761	1495141	I don't know.
1495221	1495681	I lost count.
1495701	1496661	I can't keep track of it.
1496681	1499462	They have a DDR Gold Cab there now and an
1500297	1504198	Ace, like another non-gold cab, like Ace 3 or something like that.
1504218	1506179	Well, you know that world is rolling out now.
1506239	1509119	I've seen some posts on socials about that.
1509279	1511380	Hopefully, we'll get it since we have a gold cab, right?
1511400	1514000	Does that mean, because I think that's gum in the gold cabs.
1515841	1517561	Wish we had Dance Rush, but we don't.
1518141	1518662	Do they have Pump?
1519342	1520702	No, they've had Pump it up.
1520742	1522603	They kind of moved, they moved things around a little bit.
1522643	1527524	They kind of like packed it even, you know, pushed it more into the corner a little bit.
1527724	1528224	All right.
1529324	1530325	All right.
1530385	1534428	For my gaming week, honestly, it's been most of the same stuff I usually talk about.
1534488	1537270	Diablo 4, just making progress on the latest season.
1538451	1540773	There's an XP buff right now, so I'm trying to make the most of it.
1540813	1541673	So I've gotten past level 50.
1541773	1543695	I think I'm all the way up to 62 at this point.
1544115	1549399	So I'll probably keep playing after the show tonight and throughout the week, because that buff is only through the 20th.
1549559	1551981	So I only have a few more days to make as much use out of it as I can.
1552821	1554821	Um, but I'm playing a sorcerer right now.
1554861	1560463	I switched to a ball lightning build and they are, which is a very, it's almost a mean build at this point because it's pretty powerful for sorcerers.
1560923	1562783	It is a lot of fun and very satisfying.
1562803	1566364	My biggest problem with it right now is my mana regen is not quite there.
1566804	1577166	So I pretty much always have to pop a resource potion to make myself like not constantly run out of mana, but, um, it's working, you know, and as I level up and make my way around the Paragon grid, the mana regen will get better.
1577246	1578266	So, um, yeah.
1578806	1579987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1595260	1597864	If you think I'm insufferable talking about the same games now, just wait.
1598204	1600527	There's going to be Final Fantasy XIV and nothing but for a few weeks.
1601048	1604873	And then still a little World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria remix.
1605073	1608998	I think I did a stream of that actually on Monday for a little bit because Shane was able to play with me for a bit.
1609058	1610280	So we did some of that.
1610760	1630592	and that was still fun but for me that's probably going to be winding down when Dawn Trail comes out but it was I had a lot of fun and I hope WoW does something similar like that in the future to be honest but for the rest of you who know that your summer is going to get lost to Final Fantasy XIV that event still has another like 60 days in it so I think it's
1631232	1659041	I think it goes right up until the next WoW expansion launches or maybe like the week before to help your characters because it's the easiest way to level up an alt right now like if you're buying a boost right now in World of Warcraft apologies but you're a fool right now because that Pandaria remix you can do the same thing very fast so now's the time to level all those alts if you're interested in that WoW expansion which I'll play at some point but it's not
1659909	1661310	Fortnite Fortnite Fortnite Fortnite
1682691	1683151	Forknife.
1683652	1690556	Lego Fortnite is getting some updates soon, so they're adding some more difficulty modes, kind of going in both directions with that.
1690576	1695280	So they have a cozy mode that they're going to add that kind of walks players through the game.
1695440	1696861	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf mode!
1696921	1697501	Yay!
1697821	1709289	Yeah, and then it makes the enemies easier, it takes out some of the survival elements like hunger, temperature, stamina, friendly fire, that type of stuff.
1709409	1711611	Oh, Bobby's installing Forknife as we speak.
1712498	1725448	and then on the opposite end of the spectrum there they have expert mode which also makes everything a lot harder and enables permadeath mode Bobby is uninstalling fork knife as we speak yes
1726862	1737506	and then there's also a new totem of return item that will allow you to respawn back at your bed with your backpack and you have to unlock the recipe in the game to get that.
1737526	1742288	Sounds like the totem of undying in Minecraft.
1743048	1745529	You haven't really messed around with LEGO Fortnite, have you?
1745569	1745969	No, I have not.
1751071	1751831	I just want the sets.
1752172	1753412	I want to build this stuff.
1754853	1757293	You just want those actual LEGO sets to come out?
1757373	1758554	Yeah, I want the LEGO sets.
1758874	1760615	That will absolutely be a thing, I'm sure.
1760875	1762836	It will be a thing at some point, yeah.
1762956	1763436	Eventually.
1763956	1765136	I think it's actually really fun.
1765216	1766057	I've played it a little bit.
1766797	1767597	It's a fun little game.
1768298	1768938	I think it's a really...
1769979	1779516	I really appreciate that Fortnite is, you know, we've talked about this on the show in depth, I won't bore us again, but I like that Fortnite is more than just Battle Royale at this point.
1779636	1781660	There's other interesting modes in it.
1782557	1809091	yeah it's pretty cool to see what they're doing with that I would like to see more I mean I know that they have their kind of like different tiers like one of them being a chorus so we'll get into here uh you know the music side of the things with Fortnite Festival um but it'd be cool to see like other games that even made by external publishers kind of oh I'm sure that's highlighted as well well and um isn't isn't the racing mode done by an external publisher
1810460	1813522	I mean, yeah, technically it's one they own though, isn't it?
1813542	1817966	Because it's done by the folks that did Rocket League, which is their company.
1818426	1820067	I can't remember who bought who.
1820247	1828454	I knew Harmonix did the, which I know Epic infamously bought them, but yeah.
1828554	1832137	But yeah, Fortnite Festival is getting a Metallica crossover event.
1832818	1835199	Wow, times have changed, Metallica.
1835760	1837962	From suing people that download your music to
1839073	1840013	Being in Fortnite.
1840273	1840854	That's fun.
1841814	1846376	I don't think they liked how memed their Napster lawsuits became.
1846596	1859140	I don't know if they really like that they are forever associated with it at the same time you made your bad lie in it, but I feel like I've read these interviews where they actually get really irritated whenever the Napster shit is brought up at this point.
1859488	1862430	Well, it's just like they could have done something or nothing.
1862490	1864291	That's, I guess, an option as well.
1864371	1868053	But they had to, you know, charge forward with dumb shit.
1868133	1870194	And now they get treated like, you know, this.
1870435	1877539	So, I mean, it is well within the right to, you know, defend their copyright.
1877799	1879840	By all means, you know, you can do that.
1880200	1881581	Just pick your battles, I guess.
1881741	1887025	And then, you know, don't be upset when people associate you with that.
1887285	1887465	Mm-hmm.
1888462	1889043	Down the road.
1889303	1890143	Too fucking bad.
1890504	1891424	Sorry, don't care.
1892826	1899111	I mean, Barbra Streisand has a whole internet effect named after her, so... I mean...
1900678	1902779	You make poor choices that are monumentally disliked.
1902799	1904419	She probably had nothing to do with that.
1904499	1906440	She personally probably had nothing to do with that.
1907300	1907881	And that whole thing.
1908461	1909761	Probably her lawyers, her agents.
1911122	1911862	Lawyers here too.
1912282	1914523	But pick better lawyers than I guess.
1915984	1918605	So Fortnite is getting Metallica songs.
1918645	1924887	So they're going to be adding six new Metallica tracks to buy and play, including Enter Sandman, Fuel, Ride, The Lightning, and others.
1926148	1952687	and then also they're going to allow you to even access a premium track as well including Metallica's One as part of their festival pass and then even along with that they're going to be adding Metallica themed tracks and cars in the racing portion and in LEGO Fortnite LEGO versions of Metallica as well
1953413	1954493	So that's something.
1954673	1957534	Oh, and Holographic Metallica in the Battle Royale.
1958374	1959475	It's Metallica everywhere.
1960235	1960595	Cool.
1964056	1970138	Well, I mean, they're getting so old IRL, they've got to have these virtual versions that last forever, right?
1972879	1973139	Sure.
1973399	1973659	Sure.
1975220	1975580	All right.
1976200	1981801	Well, if Fortnite isn't of interest to you, maybe something that Ubisoft is putting together is of interest to you.
1981861	1984762	Like, you know, Prince of Persia, whenever that comes out, the Sands of Time remake.
1985122	1986002	All right, Ubisoft.
1986022	1986002	2026.
1986162	1986962	Yeah, right.
1987282	1994804	So Ubisoft Forward happened this week, and they gave some announcements and some updates on some things that they're working on.
1994844	1999845	So this is kind of in line with some other not E3 events we were talking about on last week's show.
2000465	2002966	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2021292	2025653	Hey, at least they'll date that even if they won't date Beyond Good and Evil 2.
2025973	2027854	At least that one has a date.
2028274	2029834	So there you go.
2029894	2034656	Then they went into some more gameplay for Assassin's Creed Shadows which looks terrible.
2034996	2035276	Really?
2037957	2039457	It looks like Assassin's Creed.
2039557	2042658	What the terrible portion about it is the writing.
2042738	2046339	The dialogue that they had in game is not good.
2046639	2050120	It is like I was almost ready for them to go like...
2051238	2052499	Yo, let's go!
2052879	2055681	It was just about that cringe at this point.
2057102	2060084	It's not written well, is the problem.
2060204	2063186	And then also the music with it, too.
2063207	2065308	They have trap music along with it.
2065868	2067309	It just doesn't look good.
2068750	2073113	Alright, well, we also got an update on the City Builder series.
2073334	2075735	I'm going to pronounce this wrong because I've never played this.
2075895	2076176	Anno?
2076676	2077236	I was going to say Anno.
2079386	2079746	Uh, no.
2080787	2081868	So, uh, no.
2082429	2087193	117 Pax Romana is going to be the new entry that's going to be in the series.
2087473	2089455	You get to do the Ancient Roman Empire.
2089575	2089976	Yay.
2090076	2092198	PC, Xbox, PS5, all that good stuff.
2092998	2095741	Can't hate on this because this is actually a pretty rad Prince of Persia game.
2095761	2098263	The Lost Crown is going to be getting some DLC.
2098323	2100425	That's like the Metroidvania one that came out earlier this year.
2101046	2104669	There's actually a free content update that happened as well with some new outfits, amulets.
2105209	2107770	Some new platforming challenges called the Divine Trials.
2108130	2109570	And there's going to be some DLC coming.
2110150	2112731	Mask of Darkness is the name of the DLC.
2112851	2114531	It's dated for September.
2115491	2121652	The Prince of Persia, the Temple of Fire update is going to be adding content to the roguelike take on the franchise.
2122052	2124113	They hit early access earlier this year.
2124253	2129834	So, you know, if there is a genre, Ubisoft is willing to slap the Ubisoft name on, or excuse me, the...
2130914	2135096	Ubisoft is willing to slap the Prince of Persia name on it and have it sell more copies.
2136456	2138677	DarkSakura, you should be excited about this one.
2139297	2142279	Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, The Skybreaker.
2143139	2143539	Finally!
2143779	2146480	Story DLC coming to Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.
2146940	2150822	It is coming on July 16th and it's part of the game's season pass.
2151382	2153463	So I'm going to assume that is something DarkSakura will stream.
2153483	2155784	Which I already have because I got the Ultimate Edition.
2155964	2156404	Well, there you go.
2156424	2158025	You have more stuff to look forward to in July.
2158851	2160755	Well good, that means I can go back to streaming it.
2162479	2166583	X-Defiance Season 1 starts on July 2nd.
2167083	2168885	The game is in pre-season right now.
2169585	2171407	Again, a game I've never played.
2171547	2178693	Skull & Bones, this was the quadruple A title, if I remember right.
2178914	2185619	Season 2, the Chorus of Havoc is underway, and it's going to be new things to face off against.
2185719	2189523	The Brig, a new ship, limited time boat race events.
2190023	2195285	Fleet Management is coming soon, and then Season 3 will be called Into the Dragon's Wake.
2196085	2196965	Hope you all enjoy that.
2197645	2200126	The Crew Motor Fest Year 2 has a map.
2200766	2210209	A whole other year of content in the driving game that you're probably playing if you're into the crew because the original was shut down, as we've talked about a lot on this show.
2210249	2213970	But the Crew Motor Fest is still going with a whole second year of content.
2214990	2216411	And that was pretty much it.
2218442	2221425	But I mean, yeah, the new Star Wars game obviously has a lot of attention.
2221445	2227249	In fact, I noticed even in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, DarkDetsuya says the Star Wars game seems really cool.
2227610	2229551	And QuestBuster says, I'm hoping it'll be good.
2229892	2232054	I've always wanted an open world Star Wars game.
2232154	2235436	So yeah, I think, you know, there's a reason why they spent most of their time talking about that.
2235777	2237798	That's the one they want to drive pre-orders for.
2238339	2238819	It makes sense.
2241181	2241462	All right.
2241582	2243043	Did you watch that live, Loki?
2243403	2243844	I did.
2244084	2244404	I did.
2244484	2245125	Wow.
2245265	2245785	I was like...
2246929	2270050	I don't know the it was boring those yeah those company events they always have not been as good when they are after Sony and Microsoft because all the announcements end up in those and then they're just left with like updates and they don't it's very rare you might get like a uh indie-esque sort of reveal or something but that's that's it usually with that well I mean like I didn't
2271514	2274676	I mean, they didn't show Just Dance, so that's a positive, I guess.
2275696	2277237	Is there a Just Dance game coming out this year?
2277757	2278458	Probably.
2278938	2279478	I don't know.
2279798	2280739	I would assume so.
2281839	2282720	But they didn't do that.
2282780	2285221	But they still played music from all these other games.
2285681	2292244	And honestly, Skull & Bones, they're doing updates and stuff like that and talking about the big community and everything.
2292444	2293325	That game is trash.
2293405	2295325	It's absolute trash and it's awful.
2295846	2296946	And the gameplay is awful.
2297066	2300168	And the fact that they're putting all this DLC out there for it.
2300788	2317159	like I think I even some of the comments people were talking about they're like yeah that was a ship that they showed off initially that they cut from the game that they were bringing back to the game now and it I don't know I wouldn't I wouldn't spend any more time with that game if I were the folks playing that or that played that initially but
2318680	2343656	Star Wars looks okay certainly getting Far Cry vibes from it especially like when they're showing you targeting different enemies on the map like being able to spot them and then make them highlighted on the maps or in your HUD as you're playing and stuff so that it's kind of samey but it looks good I mean so at least there's that but yeah Skull and Bones stay away from that crap
2344745	2369570	I will point out so I had to research I was like where's Just Dance so Just Dance 2024 is actually the game that came out in 2023 so we would be looking for Just Dance 2025 but even the official Twitter account or just I was so desperate for information I went to Twitter uh even the official account there does not it's still promoting uh season three of Just Dance 2024 with a Katy Perry song and pretty much everything that I google is a bunch of clickbait like
2370151	2377079	Oh, my fan song list, fan made edition, fan guesses, release date guesses.
2377180	2380684	It's all that crap that, you know, is nothing to do with official news.
2381124	2383247	So we don't have official news on Just Dance 2025.
2384228	2385650	It could be something that they...
2386371	2392460	Talk about later, like, there's still Gamescom, and they're, you know, a French company, so... Or Nintendo Direct.
2392680	2395625	They often get tied with Nintendo, so it could be something they announce on Nintendo Direct.
2395685	2401213	Or Nintendo Direct, or it could just be, like... I could even see them... Because, like, honestly, like...
2402759	2405641	How much are they really improving with the gameplay for this?
2405901	2410043	It could just be one of those... It's the same thing, but it'll get much... Actually, that's a perfect example.
2410063	2410323	Sorry.
2410463	2414826	It's a perfect example of why... Do you remember when that Nintendo Direct leak was going around last week?
2415466	2416767	There's one of these every week, yes.
2417167	2424751	But I say one way you can always look at these things with a critical eye is that the leak lists often are always too good to be true.
2425011	2426232	I scroll back and forth, alright.
2448261	2451502	Just Dance VR, Welcome to Dance City.
2453203	2456064	Are they skipping a regular one to do a VR one?
2456344	2456804	I don't know.
2457024	2459585	That's coming to MetaQuest on October 15th.
2462386	2464747	So, I don't know.
2465547	2466407	There's still time.
2466567	2469088	It's not like we need to know.
2469148	2475631	If Gamescom and a Nintendo Direct go by and we still haven't heard, then that's the cause for the Just Dance fans to be concerned.
2475731	2476411	All does know you.
2476611	2476791	Yeah.
2479161	2480022	Just Dance Lore Just Dance Lore
2503450	2504331	Something going on.
2504351	2505994	Hey, I'm not going to mock the game.
2506034	2506434	You know what?
2506474	2518111	Like, to me, feeling, you know, I honestly, I would not want to mock a game like this because it feels like someone making fun of, like, Dance Dance Revolution or something like that.
2518211	2518432	I know.
2518452	2518652	I know.
2518692	2519754	Don't bite the hand that feeds.
2520234	2520715	No, exactly.
2520815	2522517	I'm not mocking the game itself.
2522677	2526482	I will mock their presentation of having the dancers out there to announce the game every year.
2526522	2527203	That is cringe.
2527303	2531148	And I will mock their aggressive monetization schemes in the game.
2531428	2532370	That I will mock as well.
2532470	2533111	That as well.
2533251	2535894	But, like, I would not... The game itself is solid.
2536034	2536935	It's a fun game.
2536975	2538197	I've played it, like,
2538806	2542768	I don't remember which one it was a long time ago, but it's fun.
2542889	2544049	It's still a fun game.
2544309	2547852	It's cool that there's rhythm in music games out there still.
2547912	2556597	I'm all willing to support that, but also Ubisoft with all their drama and mismanagement and stuff like that.
2558581	2560525	Do I want to get nasty grams this week?
2560705	2561326	Okay, fuck it.
2562028	2567378	I just want to remind everybody my birthday's coming up, so you're not allowed to send me, and it's Pride Month, so you're not allowed to send me hate mail.
2568220	2570224	I would argue Just Dance isn't really a rhythm game.
2571698	2576841	and the reason it's a learning choreography game.
2576961	2579383	It's a Simon Says choreography repetition game.
2579543	2580783	That's what it really is to me.
2580804	2582544	That's exactly what it is.
2582585	2583205	Thank you.
2583885	2584386	Kind of.
2584786	2592090	It's a choreography game because you're not really doing beat matching or anything like that and it's always the same thing over and over.
2592330	2595032	It's not necessarily there's so much interpretation.
2595052	2596813	Kind of like Parapara to be honest.
2597013	2598434	That's like Dance Central.
2598534	2600034	I love Dance Central.
2600054	2600895	That was a fun game.
2602035	2604176	Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
2604236	2604716	Thank you.
2607697	2608077	Alright.
2608577	2609638	That's an ally right there.
2609658	2611758	Alright.
2612839	2613599	Let's move on.
2613639	2616640	DarkSakura, how about sequels that we want to games, DarkSakura?
2617515	2632464	well how about something from Yacht Club Games how about a new Shovel Knight yes to that so it is in development they are working on
2633445	2653705	improving and innovating some of the mechanics but want it to be like a new adventure something that's going to actually add and contribute and expand on the universe they don't have everything ready to unveil yet but they say look for it
2655574	2658976	They keep hinting with this specific quote.
2658996	2663619	They keep saying that it will launch Subtle Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.
2663839	2664740	It's a 3D game.
2665320	2666601	It's going to be a 3D platformer.
2666981	2667601	I guarantee it.
2668262	2668722	Interesting.
2669162	2680469	Again, to me, all that is, if I have my Magic 8-Ball, and y'all know my predictions are decent sometimes, perfect Nintendo Direct announcement.
2680689	2682210	Perfect Nintendo Direct announcement.
2683130	2683330	Yeah.
2684091	2684311	Hmm.
2685966	2688010	They know what we want and it's not 3D.
2691056	2695485	What if they did a Shovel Knight game in the style of Mega Man Legends?
2696184	2699786	No, I want it to be a Shovel Knight game, not a Mega Man Legends game.
2702327	2703047	Show me a trailer.
2703427	2706209	I feel like I can't judge anything until I see a trailer.
2706449	2711991	Because maybe it's one of those 2D games that kind of flips into 3D or a 2D game rendered in 3D.
2712011	2712612	Show me a trailer.
2712632	2712772	Alright.
2712792	2713952	Moving on, Loki.
2713992	2714152	Alright.
2714172	2714392	Alright.
2722981	2723922	People are mad.
2724522	2725063	What?
2725103	2725743	People are mad?
2726264	2727124	I know, people are mad.
2727745	2728325	It's the same.
2729426	2730206	Gamers?
2730426	2730967	Mad?
2731667	2734889	No, no, it's a tale as old as time when it comes to Bethesda.
2734930	2742835	So, this week we had the Starfield creation toolkit, I believe, come out.
2743555	2749359	Allowing folks to essentially be able to create mods for Starfield, which is a good thing.
2750520	2756924	The bad thing is, you know, Bethesda being Bethesda and selling mods on their marketplace.
2757644	2763348	So, for example, one of the things they announced, I think this was the one at the Xbox event, was...
2763908	2770734	This special Trackers Alliance The Vulture, which was a bounty hunter event.
2771715	2774598	Essentially, it's like one mission that you could buy.
2775218	2775959	And it's $7.
2777020	2777620	But guess what?
2777761	2779322	You can only buy credits in $10 increments.
2781684	2781984	Great!
2782584	2809930	And then there's also other things you can buy for $10 including just some decorative elements to put in your spaceships and outposts or $3 worth of that kind of stuff for an in-game plushie So of course people have been review bombing this because they said putting mods behind a paywall is a big no for me Creators Club is a scam So yeah
2811533	2812256	People don't like it.
2812940	2813382	Alright.
2814917	2844257	uh well yeah I mean the whole concept of paid mods is interesting to me but I then I think I think back to like the CD-ROM era when CD-ROMs were all the rage and you remember like when you could buy Duke Nukem 3D on CD-ROM and it came with like 20 2800 different versions of Duke Nukem those are all mods that was kind of like a way of doing paid mods in a way um it feels like you know a different era yeah I don't know plus when you had so many
2845157	2846038	for one cost.
2846118	2847719	It felt like a deal, right?
2848339	2848940	Right, exactly.
2849900	2851081	Let's think about that.
2851982	2854263	Those were probably those discs.
2854283	2857726	I have purchased those discs before, and they were great.
2857926	2862829	It was essentially... This is back in the day when there wasn't a high-speed internet.
2862869	2865230	It was just all dial-up.
2865531	2871815	You can't just download... You could try to download these through AOL or something like that, but it would take...
2872495	2896480	forever and then storing it and stuff so they would sell map packs and you would pay like it was probably like 20 bucks maybe upwards of 50 dollars but you're getting like hundreds of maps and fast forward to 2024 where Bethesda is offering you one mission for seven dollars yeah like I'm sorry no inflation's not that bad
2899509	2900670	It's just stupid.
2901270	2901970	And I get it.
2902170	2903470	I get it.
2905111	2912593	Their excuse is like, well, we developed this in-house or we're allowing authors to sell their mods if they want.
2913453	2914573	I mean, that's cool.
2915493	2922615	I would just say don't buy these and just play other free mods.
2922635	2924475	Because there's other free mods that are out there.
2924515	2925556	Not everything is paid.
2926116	2926776	And you can...
2928052	2954766	you know, play the other stuff, like this is probably not worth it for $7 anyways, I guarantee that if it's a mission created by Bethesda, it's probably not worth it, their missions kind of suck sometimes especially in like Starfield where a lot of the stuff is really buggy or like we're talking about the Radiant missions that are just churning the same, oh collect this, go do this, go do that, you know, and it's kind of annoying, but I don't know, just vote with your wallet
2955704	2984260	apparently enough people voted with their wallet in Skyrim that they thought that this was a great idea or Fallout 76, I mean there's no modding in Fallout 76, well maybe there is but Fallout 4, you know I'm sure they have the same thing there where enough people buy it, they're going to do it again or they figure like, oh they're going to make us think about it now but if we keep it in here long enough they're just going to forget about it and go on to the next thing people that don't know better will plunk down the money yep
2985287	2990649	All right, well, Jamie, I know you have no problem plunking down the money for this game coming up.
2990689	2992029	I think you're excited about, right?
2993289	2995630	Oh, you have no idea.
2995930	2998051	I have been watching the trailers.
2998251	3003912	I've been watching the gameplay demonstrations.
3004292	3009834	I really have been looking forward to Dragon Age The Veil Guard for like some time.
3012696	3034968	the bit that they showed was like going to find Solas and stop what he was doing and the new characters are pretty cool I'd have to say it's definitely it's basically set in the Tevinter area which we've just heard of for a while and haven't really had much going on in that area
3036923	3043885	and it looks like a lot of the action is going right off of Inquisition so I like that.
3045905	3058648	The characters they've shown already are fantastic because of course we have Varric and we got to and Scout Harding is there and there's a mage named Nev who is absolutely fantastic.
3058768	3060428	She's just
3062037	3062658	She's the shit.
3062758	3063578	I'm just going to leave it that way.
3063618	3064459	I like the character.
3068021	3082051	It's really just like the dialogue going on in-game is good and it just really feels connected and live and not just nothing is happening while you're just running around.
3082372	3084953	It's very... The banter is great.
3084973	3086574	I mean, there's just like so much.
3087595	3087795	And it...
3093041	3115172	it does sort of like have a feel of watching like maybe a well not really like a mobile game but some of that same just sort of you know move from A to B to A to B just really fast but I think that I like it you know I'm looking forward to it they say it's going to be sometime fall of this year we'll see when that is
3116243	3141237	yeah i gotta say um you know i really enjoy the art style in this and i'm gonna admit like dragon age um was kind of a game that i'm i'm i've always been a little bit more meh on this series i enjoyed inquisition enough i wasn't as into it as i was say mass effect so when they announced this game you know and it's you know because what it went from being you know the next dragon age to being dragon age uh dread wolf
3141457	3143018	Yeah, Dread Wolf, and now it's the Veil Guard.
3143379	3146061	So, you know, I've been kind of like, meh, meh, meh.
3146121	3149964	And then even that trailer they put out was a little bit meh to me.
3150484	3154687	But now that I've seen this gameplay video, yeah, oh, this character's fierce as fuck.
3155348	3157449	Sorry, we're watching gameplay if you're live on Twitch.
3157489	3158410	I'm playing some of the trailer.
3158850	3159630	Yeah, she's fierce.
3159670	3160071	I like her.
3160491	3166353	But I just have to say, when I watch this, I really like the art style, and it is so fucking fluid.
3166753	3167953	That's what I really notice.
3168094	3174596	I'm like, is it really going to run this well on a PS5 or a Series X or a high-end computer?
3174656	3175576	Because damn.
3175756	3177397	On a computer, absolutely.
3177757	3183263	Yeah, with solid state drives and everything, maybe it is like, you know, being able to reduce loading time, just make everything so fluid.
3183303	3185625	But I'm like, this just looks bomb.
3185946	3190030	And like just the minimal combat I've seen with Rook and, you know, moving the swords around.
3190070	3191752	I'm like, that just looks really fun.
3191792	3200841	Like I, I would, this game went from being kind of a meh on my radar to being like, oh, fuck, I think I kind of want to play this real bad, actually.
3200861	3200941	Yeah.
3200981	3228303	I've been reading the comics ever since the first game there'd be the in-between comics there's some really good ones for post-Inquisition but I like that you can really tell in Varric and Harding looks kind of like the same as she always has but Varric looks like he does in the comics in the last series of comics that came out so they're keeping the character styles consistent throughout the entire franchise yeah
3229003	3231645	and that to me definitely means something.
3231685	3233407	I'd like to see some characters come back.
3233587	3244035	So apparently one of the a couple of the customization things is for one of them is customizing your Inquisitor
3245828	3267010	so I think it's going to be like an Inquisition where your Hawk from Dragon Age 2 came back I would love to of course even though his voice actor is a dick I would love to see Cullen come back I would love to see Alistair come back I want to see some of those old faces you know but I like when they bring them back and they're like
3267563	3268705	Oh, yay, they're here!
3268905	3271510	And not a, they're gonna take over the game!
3271770	3272131	You know?
3273232	3279162	It's not just, oh, it's a cameo in the background, but it plays into the game in a meaningful fashion.
3279442	3280283	That's the kind of...
3282689	3299388	you know what that Dragon Age gameplay thing has me even more hyped for now is whatever's coming next for Mass Effect because I'm like if Dragon Age looks that good like Mass Effect and they're going back to our universe with our Shepard apparently like I'm really excited about the next Mass Effect to be honest
3299818	3313195	I'm so glad I saved every last one of my damn save files I still have one float around on my Xbox because remember I played the trilogy originally on Xbox 360 I had those save file editors Was it Xbox 360 or Xbox One?
3313396	3317701	No, I think it was the 360 actually It was that long ago
3319905	3325508	I saved all the stuff for my old PC and my Parallels install when I was trying to play it.
3325648	3331150	I might actually have to see if Parallels will run better now and see if I can play some of the games again.
3335012	3338874	Apparently the old save editor worked at least for Mass Effect 2 and 3.
3342555	3343716	I'm talking about the remakes.
3344841	3349448	Oh yeah, you know, and I still need to really give the remakes a good try.
3349508	3353253	Like, I played a bit of the first one, but I really need to sit down and take the time.
3353273	3356057	But it's so hard when there's so many games that never quit.
3357782	3359083	No, no, I get it.
3359724	3360004	All right.
3360524	3365508	Well, you know, another company trying to get our attention with latest and greatest games, Capcom.
3366309	3369171	So Capcom recently did a fan survey.
3369311	3370492	It's been going on for a few months.
3370972	3372473	I thought we got some results.
3372493	3376517	Like, this feels a little repetitive to me because I was like, I thought we saw some results from this.
3377097	3385724	But the tweet is from this week where Capcom actually put out, here are the fan vote results of what the biggest...
3386464	3388726	Franchises are in various countries.
3388866	3392748	I think maybe this was, I think the other one was what franchise, that's what it was.
3392808	3395690	What franchises do you want to see come back?
3396290	3398852	And this one is what's like your favorite.
3399392	3404935	So for Japan, the results were number one, Monster Hunter.
3405616	3407457	Number two, Mega Man, Rockman.
3408097	3410179	Number three, Ace Attorney.
3411252	3414575	Resident Evil, Street Fighters, and Capcom Mega Man is still number 2
3434575	3436797	But then Devil May Cry is actually number three.
3436898	3441462	Monster Hunter is not until you get to number four, but I think we always knew that Monster Hunter was pretty big in Japan.
3442743	3445066	And then after that, you keep on going down the list.
3445166	3446627	Dino Crisis, Street Fighter.
3446647	3448229	That doesn't seem right.
3448269	3449170	That doesn't seem right.
3449370	3451131	The fans rigged the voting.
3451732	3456977	Street Fighter is number seven, which shows you how well received Street Fighter V was, I guess.
3457358	3457538	But
3458298	3476577	6 is pretty good, I thought, so I don't know Dino Crisis is not more popular than Street Fighter, I'm sorry At the same time It's just stupid It's a fucking fan poll and maybe we need to not read into it too seriously But it is interesting when the company itself endorses and kind of speaks on it So that's why I'm mentioning it
3477257	3503714	and you know I'm sure Capcom takes that stuff under under advisement it is nice to see Mega Man coming in at number two because it really shows that like we want more Mega Man games we haven't had one in a little while I mean we've had kind of re-releases and you know the Game Boy ones just showed up on the Nintendo you know archives and all that but yeah very curious to see if they end up doing another full Mega Man game all right let's move on Loki
3505188	3505528	All right.
3506368	3513731	Well, there's some updates coming to the PlayStation 5, including Discord support.
3513831	3523013	So now using your console, you're actually going to be able to connect directly to Discord, much like the Xbox platform has been able to do for a while now.
3523053	3525654	So, hey, cross-platform play Discord.
3525794	3530436	I mean, you're probably already doing it anyways, but now you can do it with your actual console.
3530476	3531236	So that's kind of cool.
3531656	3531836	Nice.
3534093	3542036	Yeah, they had some, but you had to go through your phone and all that complicated shit before, so it's nice that this is going to be directly built in.
3542176	3543597	It's long overdue, to be honest.
3544717	3545057	All right.
3545577	3550739	Well, this is an interesting sort of partnership that has occurred in the mobile space.
3550859	3553440	I don't know how many of you have ever heard of the app BeReal.
3554481	3562344	BeReal is an app that I think came out a couple years ago, and it's kind of like a Snapchat or an Instagram story, might be a better way to put it.
3562904	3567247	But at some point, I've never used it, but I've heard of other people using it.
3567988	3571890	At some point during the day, it says it's time to be real.
3572251	3577795	And you're supposed to snap a picture and your front and back cameras go off at the same time.
3578615	3585840	And you have like two minutes to respond to the toast pop up because it's supposed to be like, what is everybody doing exactly at this moment?
3585880	3588082	That's like undoctored, unposed.
3588462	3592165	You know, I think that's its way of kind of needling Instagram is that it's real, right?
3592205	3592605	Or whatever.
3593225	3596126	I bet it's not that real, but real enough, I guess.
3596726	3603368	So BeReal was huge, but there apparently are still a lot of people that are using it.
3604428	3608189	And a game publisher named Voodoo has bought them.
3608889	3610530	Voodoo is also in the mobile space.
3610750	3614731	They do free-to-play mobile titles that often have a lot of ads.
3615231	3618612	Probably the one you know the most is Hole.io.
3620092	3628235	It wasn't Donut County, which was the actual indie game, but there was Whole.io, which was the same concept.
3628275	3633196	The Whole.io, that's just such a nicely named name.
3633256	3637518	So much thought put into it, just as much thought as they stole the original concept.
3637538	3641379	Yeah, they took the whole concept and made it its own thing.
3643359	3644700	But anyway, what's that?
3645506	3646346	I said, of course they did.
3670151	3674673	Itself has kind of died down in popularity because what happened?
3674873	3677954	Instagram and TikTok made the same gimmick at some point.
3679054	3682176	So I don't know, but it's still going, I guess.
3683656	3691999	But yeah, Voodoo in talking about Be Real says there are 40 million active users, but that's not necessarily daily active users.
3692099	3694720	That's just probably people that haven't closed their accounts over the years.
3694980	3697961	So interesting kind of alliance there.
3700103	3709250	So with that, we will go to our next segment and travel back to a time when there was no mobile app alignment.
3709670	3713473	Your cameras did not take the quality pictures they take today.
3713814	3714754	It was a very different time.
3714794	3717016	Let's get to... Your camera attached to your Game Boy.
3717256	3719898	Yeah, it was a camera attached to your Game Boy with a shitty little printer.
3720819	3721500	Here we go.
3732546	3739812	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3740312	3742855	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3743735	3745377	And what did you pick this week, DarkSakura?
3746397	3747959	I picked a game called Gunner's Heaven.
3748559	3752923	It was also known as Rapid Reload in Europe.
3754008	3764436	So the game, and I actually got the idea because Dan and I were watching some stuff on Gunstar Heroes and then this playthrough came up and I was like, oh, that's a neat one.
3766198	3775886	So it is a run and gun game that was created by Media.Vision and published by Sony for the PlayStation in Japan and Europe in 1995.
3776346	3780569	It was re-released on PSN in Japan in 2007 and in Asia in 2010.
3784757	3812411	it has been very much compared to Gunstar Heroes by Treasure you can choose to play either Axel the dude or Ruka the lady through six different levels and you can switch with four different weapons from a machine pistol, a flamethrower, a homing laser or a multi-directional cannon each character has their own set of four weapons so you can get a total of eight depending on who you're playing
3813512	3829291	you also have a grappling hook you can also do aiming by holding R2 on the controller you can throw your enemies in different directions just like how Red and Blue can in Gunstar Heroes
3830492	3856862	you have a point system in the game which you collect the points that are dropped by your enemies and then when you collect them you have a counter that increases and will start counting down the more that you collect the weapons will also become more powerful and then you can find a booster that will temporarily increase your weapon strength it's like
3857722	3865025	It's like the nuke of the game, but that timer is going to go back down again while you're using the booster.
3866366	3871988	There, like I said, was six stages, and there are one or two sub-bosses and then the true boss.
3873769	3877191	It was released in Europe and Japan, but not in North America.
3878031	3883694	The rumor is that Sony's thing against releasing 2D games for PlayStation in the US was the reasoning.
3885997	3895055	it got from Famicom it got a 26 wait, I can't make words happen, I swear Famicom Tsushin gave it a 26 out of 40
3898448	3920908	Hamitsu gave it a 27 out of 40 in the US Next Generation reviewed the Japanese version as an import and gave it a 4 out of 5 but it was a very enjoyable game and it really was well enjoyed but often said not as good as Gunstar Heroes
3921969	3941788	so it doesn't have the simultaneous two-player that Gunstar has and especially the PAL version was considered to be very sloppy the footage that we're watching is from the Japanese version but yeah it's a
3943577	3944718	It should have come out over here.
3944758	3946058	I really do feel that it should have.
3946078	3947439	I think it would have sold wonderfully.
3947479	3958783	But you can see, even just in some of the animation, the character style, that it looks not too far off than Gunstar Heroes.
3960743	3966625	It's a quick and short one, but I thought that it would be a good one to bring up and put on people's radars.
3966645	3968226	You can buy a copy for about $175.
3968266	3968526	Is that all?
3972279	3977243	Well, considering what the market is like now, that's practically a steal in some cases.
3977464	3978384	Yeah, I gotcha.
3979485	3983249	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
3984862	4011569	Rapid Reload or Gunner's Heaven that's it alright let's get back to it and we have just a few more segments for you and then we're you know what we don't have a lot of news stories left to be honest so if we you want to call in you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord and we'll check on our mailbag to participate at orange launch radio dot com first let's do some rapid fire news Loki
4012639	4021363	Well, they spend very much time waiting to implement mods into Doom based off of the new Doom trailer because now we have the Shield Saw.
4021803	4033708	So the Shield Saw is a mod that's for the original Doom that essentially replaces the Chainsaw with the Shield Saw model as seen in the Doom Dark Ages trailer.
4034749	4037370	And you can actually check that out.
4038070	4045837	They have a video online, you can check it out through, it shows like the first level of Doom 2, playing through that, and it looks awesome.
4046998	4055286	Also, they are, I don't know if they're doing anything else with that, they're actually modding levels and stuff, but yeah, it's neat.
4057418	4058338	DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
4084528	4087189	Oh my gosh, okay, I just like completely misheard that.
4087709	4090771	Well, how about Parasol Stars, the story of Bubble Bobble 3?
4092751	4103676	That is going to be launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on July 11th for 10 Bones or 10 Yettos.
4106263	4131153	9.99 US and 9.99 Euros There will be there actually are already pre-orders available for Switch on the Nintendo eShop with a 10% discount and it will be open for the Xbox family for July 19th PlayStation 5 and PS4 versions are available on PlayStation Store and it's
4132233	4156942	it's Parasol Stars don't know what else I can say about it it's cute and you have Parasols and you jump around and you defeat cute enemies yeah Parasol Stars and Rainbow Islands never get as much love as the original Bubble Bobble and they deserve it I love Parasol Stars they're great but Rainbow Islands to me is quite the different game with similar stuff I like Parasol Stars though fair
4158101	4158522	All right.
4158662	4163388	Well, I have a story for you, too, and it's about the Until Dawn movie adaptation.
4164329	4166973	And we know some of the cast that's going to be in the movie.
4167714	4169697	And it's nobody that was in the game.
4169817	4172580	So this is going to be a different cast of people all together.
4173261	4173862	and many more.
4199422	4201504	So that, or excuse me, Sitting in Bar with Cake.
4202365	4204767	So those are some of the people that have signed on to the movie.
4205067	4210892	The movie will be about eight young adults who have to get through the night because they are being hunted by a killer.
4211873	4214395	But I don't, I don't think
4215635	4216996	It's going to mirror the game.
4217056	4223479	It sounds like it is going to be like in the same universe, but it's not going to be like this person's playing this character, you know, from the game and so on and so on.
4223819	4231062	You might remember when the game was made, there were some pretty familiar faces in there, including Rami Malek was in the actual game.
4231422	4234704	Hayden Pantier, the girl from Heroes.
4236364	4238385	Hayden Pantier.
4238585	4240086	Yeah, was in that game as well.
4240906	4244008	So, yeah, they had some big names of the time there.
4245322	4246063	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4263899	4267420	Um, so yeah, cause you know, Hayden Pentonier, is that her name?
4267740	4269701	Was in Scream 6, you might remember.
4269741	4274602	She brought her character back and she's just, she's not a teenager anymore, which is, which is fine.
4274642	4275463	People age, right?
4275523	4276163	It happens, right?
4276183	4277743	But she's, you know, she's not a teenager anymore.
4277903	4279524	So, all right.
4280484	4286466	Uh, let's move on and check out world release dates and some games that are coming out, uh, in a country near you.
4286606	4287246	Let's start with the U.S.
4288667	4294312	So we have Still Wakes the Deep on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
4295113	4301299	Echo Generations Midnight Edition on PC, I believe that's the Steam version, and Nintendo Switch.
4302320	4304902	Moonstone Island on Nintendo Switch.
4305523	4311628	Ever After Falls on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
4313929	4329685	Mushoku Tensei Jobless Reincarnation Quest of Memories on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 Rusted Moss on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series
4330666	4334049	Scars of Mars on PC and Nintendo Switch.
4335149	4344356	Then, of course, the DLC for Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
4345056	4351261	Times and Galaxy on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
4351841	4360027	And finally, the expansion for Elder Scrolls Online, Gold Road on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
4361636	4362596	I don't see PC on there.
4362996	4363356	That's weird.
4386761	4389242	No, I'm sorry, that's a Europe date sneaking its way onto my list.
4389262	4391243	So I think that is it for Japan next week.
4391283	4392303	Yep, that's it for the Switch.
4392664	4393604	But let's look at the PlayStation 5.
4394624	4403588	PlayStation 5 has that Mushoku Tensei Jobless Reincarnation Quest to Memories is out on the PlayStation 5, as is Rusted Moss.
4403668	4409211	But just those two games coming to PlayStation 5 this week in Japan, all on the 20th of June.
4409851	4411632	DarkSakura, how about Europe?
4411909	4428957	so for the UK on the 18th for PlayStation we have Still Wakes the Deep for PlayStation and Xbox we have Police Simulator Patrol Officers Gold Edition on the 20th for Switch Windstorm and Unexpected Arrival PlayStation we have Five Nights at Freddy's Help 102
4430798	4436440	We have on the 21st... Is that still this week?
4436520	4436880	I can't.
4437160	4437600	Yeah, it is.
4437700	4438120	Fight his way.
4438301	4438661	Okay.
4439461	4443122	We have Elden Ring, Shadow of the Urge Tree for PlayStation and Xbox.
4444583	4446383	I know my husband's excited about that one.
4446443	4448804	He's getting his character in Elden Ring all prepped for it, so...
4450487	4453931	I've had a lot of friends playing Elden Ring lately for the same reason.
4454151	4456013	It's going to get worse next week, but I get it.
4456173	4456493	I get it.
4457495	4468807	By the way, when I was going through the Japanese releases, DJ Ranma S in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network said, Mushoku Tensei, that anime is so good, pointing out to another question in chat.
4468867	4470428	If you want to watch it, it is on Crunchyroll.
4471349	4471549	So...
4472671	4473071	There you go.
4473291	4474951	And DJ Ranma S knows his anime.
4476032	4476352	All right.
4476812	4480612	Well, with that, believe it or not, we've covered all the news we're going to cover this week.
4480712	4482813	It's been a little bit lighter in the news department.
4483253	4487374	I will, as always, of course, before we get to... I don't think we have any emails, but I'll check anyway.
4488654	4490714	I'll check with Loki, see if we have any last-minute stories.
4491734	4491914	Nope.
4492254	4492455	Nope.
4493915	4494775	Lighter week, isn't it?
4495395	4496635	DarkSakura, do we get any emails?
4496715	4498156	Participate at OrangeLunchRadio.com?
4498576	4498676	One.
4499276	4499356	One?
4499456	4499796	Oh, goody.
4499876	4500496	Okay, let's do it.
4501741	4505702	Alright, so this is from Mishi.
4506402	4507802	Hi y'all, it's your girl Mishi here.
4507922	4509043	I have a question for you all.
4509083	4513484	So I was watching the Ubisoft Forward and I noticed there was an interpreter for ASL.
4513884	4515964	There's also one on Disney, I believe, too.
4516084	4523146	My question is, since they used one during the presentation, do you think this will ever be implemented in video games as well?
4523766	4528107	I think it would be something cool to see used for, say, kids who can't read
4528627	4530748	yet well are those who are learning ASL.
4531069	4531609	What are your thoughts?
4531649	4533610	Always happy gaming and have a good one.
4533670	4534691	Sincerely, Michi Kintz.
4534831	4537413	I actually can answer some very significant questions about this.
4537633	4538013	Go for it.
4538874	4556085	First of all, the dialogue in game, they will usually provide the subtitles instead of having an interpreter because if you think about it, they would have to animate and render an interpreter to stay on screen.
4557449	4561050	It's not really going to be realistic.
4562630	4577314	It would be easier to have a person in the room with them signing as opposed to having a specific set of a character with skins and set animations and making it look believable.
4577614	4582575	On top of that too, a big component of ASL is facial expression.
4583235	4586356	And you can't gather that perfectly from
4587656	4616956	a 3D model you can get close but sometimes it's going to be lost and then on top of that you're also dealing with regional differences in ASL British ASL and American ASL for example are different so for example if you were saying in English the man jumped off the building in ASL you would set up the building first then establish the man and then have him fall off of it whereas British ASL to my sorry BSL to my memory
4617336	4620139	would set it up in standard sentence structure.
4621960	4626905	So you're dealing... My uncle's an interpreter, by the way, and a speech pathologist.
4628666	4641617	There are some, like Bobby was saying just now, where a character in-game may communicate in ASL, but having an interpretation...
4642739	4646961	Available non-stop, you know, like the little interpreter in the bottom of the screen that you see.
4647441	4648622	That's not going to be realistic.
4648962	4653684	I mean, unless a developer wants to take that initiative and make it happen.
4653724	4658586	I mean, I'm not going to say I don't want it to happen because I would love for something like that to happen.
4658766	4662648	And actually, I do want to point out, there is a recent game that did it.
4663588	4664749	And it was Forza Horizon 5.
4665749	4672597	So, Forza Horizon 5 actually did incorporate ASL, but it is, you know, and DarkSakura's pretty much outlined the reasons why you don't see it very often.
4672617	4676541	A developer really has to go out of their way to do it and put that support in there.
4676601	4680906	But yes, Forza Horizon is one, 5 specifically in recent memory, that did it.
4681306	4692734	All I can really find, I was trying to look for gameplay that showed it in action, and all I could really find was the Microsoft sizzle reel that kind of shows it in action, but they show a little bit about how that's kind of all working.
4693054	4702000	As you watch this video, it's, again, more them trying to promote it, but you do see some instances mixed in this video here where they actually, you can see what the sign language kind of looks like there.
4702361	4702981	Somebody's lying.
4703001	4703542	I said but.
4704382	4705003	Yeah, no, I know.
4705643	4706564	I was going to go into it.
4706924	4707504	Oh, I'm sorry.
4708385	4708925	That's okay.
4708945	4709245	Okay.
4710652	4711813	But at any rate, yeah.
4713894	4720299	But by the way, I'm sorry, just happy pride to this guy in the shirt that's signing bear.
4720739	4726484	I just want to say happy pride to the bear guy in the Forza Horizon 5 video and him only.
4727464	4728285	I'm down for that.
4728405	4729226	I'm down for that.
4730006	4734329	The other thing actually I want to throw in there too is regional sign language idioms.
4734349	4734930	Okay.
4736087	4757491	so there are those things too one of my favorite ones it's a fairly universal I'm gonna see if I can get my little avatar to do it it's gonna be hard is you're sitting one arm on top and the other arm on the bottom and you throw up horns on one and the other hand I can't get it to show up is doing like it's it's a sign for bullshit
4759690	4762239	One hand is pooping out and the other one is the horns on the head.
4762439	4763663	And they're together.
4765188	4766332	That one's one of my favorite ones.
4767386	4768507	Great question, though.
4769968	4770949	Yeah, that's a really good question.
4770969	4772029	Yeah, that's a really good question.
4772209	4781916	So, you know, and something the industry, yeah, I think DarkSakura, you give a lot of good, like, realistic sort of like, here's why it's hard to do and so forth.
4781976	4789602	But I think that's when you see a game like Forza Horizon 5 or Moss, you know, many people in the chat talking about that, too, that does that.
4790282	4797248	In a game, it just makes it all that much more like, wow, they really want to make sure their game is seen and played by as many people as possible.
4797268	4798129	It makes that very special.
4798950	4808938	And I think that on average, with some of the games that are released, they are intended for a certain age group that's expected to have a certain degree of literacy.
4809119	4809319	Mm-hmm.
4811167	4831113	so I'm just gonna throw that out there but but I think though that for certain other games though they would benefit for something like that you know especially if it's for the younger viewers younger players um speaking of oh go ahead I just think I wouldn't mind seeing something like that happen
4832154	4847960	Speaking of accessibility, I think I've brought this up on the show before, but I just want to make sure people know this now because we've been asked about this in the past, and it is something that used to be something that was prohibitively expensive, and that is transcripts of this program.
4848220	4854482	And can you have the ability to actually read through and see the words on the screen and all that of this program online?
4855162	4860884	which in the past has been very expensive to do because services would charge by the minute and so forth.
4860944	4866746	And again, I would love that if we had that type of income, if we had those sorts of investors behind us.
4866826	4867286	We don't.
4867666	4870427	We're operated out of our homes in our spare time.
4870467	4871568	We don't have that kind of budget.
4871668	4874789	But thanks to more modern tools, that is available.
4875049	4876329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4897614	4898735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4916773	4920094	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4947383	4950724	That is something that's available for those that want to venture through that.
4951465	4952425	And I think it's great.
4952565	4953205	I'm all for it.
4953385	4954566	So, yeah.
4955126	4960568	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, now someone can read all about dying in a boat fire on an ocean of piss.
4960828	4965570	Yes, as I think we've compared certain game experiences to in the past.
4967762	4968702	What game was that?
4968963	4971084	We were saying.
4971504	4972564	There was also another one.
4973245	4974705	It's like pissing in an ocean of piss.
4974785	4976266	I remember that was a thing.
4977887	4978227	Anyway.
4980046	4981287	I have to search the transcripts.
4981987	4982307	All right.
4983768	4985990	Well, I think that's it for Lister Roundtable.
4986050	4991553	I want to call out, if you have an email for a future week, participate at orange.trader.com is the place to do it.
4991593	4993735	But with that, we're at the end of the show.
4993915	4996737	I know it's a little shorter tonight, but that's the way the news is, and that's fine.
4997457	5001640	We've had a few long episodes in the last couple weeks, so we're going to wrap it up for tonight.
5002080	5002340	Um, it's, uh
5031269	5031769	I don't know.
5032210	5033750	I don't have thoughts anymore.
5033991	5038633	I have one rollercoaster motion to the other followed by copious amounts of sleep.
5040194	5040574	Mood!
5041375	5044257	Lucky, because I slept maybe four hours on Friday night, but that's alright.
5044317	5044777	It happens.
5046558	5060126	But, you know, just I would love for just everyone to take one moment out of your day on any day and take it for yourself and tell yourself
5061232	5090438	that you are that you have a place and that you should always just understand that there's a place for everybody in the world okay alright bye bye have a good stream Loki you're up next what's your final thought for us tonight I think I've gotten to a point where I have so many games in the humble bundle I don't know what's in my library and what's not in my library and I wish there was an easy way to determine that
5091232	5091552	Mood.
5093033	5095654	And then my final thought is, guess what, everybody?
5096134	5100616	DJ Ranma S came through with me for a special request, so you're going to see that here momentarily.
5101076	5106578	So on that note, I hope you all have a very wonderful week, and we will be back in seven days to do this all over again.
5106938	5110040	Thank you all so much, and happy Daddy's Day to all of you.
