9904	10484	Thank you for watching!
39076	41418	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
41478	46542	Welcome back once again to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46642	48824	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48864	55310	We're live tonight, June 9th, 2024 with episode number 1007 of our show.
55750	59233	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week with my co-host.
59373	61295	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62856	69201	Hello, I hope you are having a lovely summer so far now that it's June, even though it's not officially summer, but summer enough.
69601	70001	It's hot.
70922	77666	Apart from my work having a Pride event and me going out for an entire 20 minutes and coming in sunburned?
78087	78227	No.
79711	83732	Yeah, that's why I didn't go to Pride downtown this week either.
83792	84273	Same thing.
84993	86073	Pride needs a new month.
86413	90435	I understand why it's in June, but we need to find some other things.
90735	93896	Isn't there also October Pride stuff?
94236	96237	Well, if you're in Palm Springs, yes.
96437	103659	And I think they do an event here locally over Labor Day weekend, which I haven't been to in 13 years as long as I've been doing DragonCon.
103679	105200	But that is completely put on by the
105660	106560	March Pride March Pride
120700	121621	I think that would be better.
121681	122701	That would be lovely.
123301	127204	March or even April, you know, a little rain during Pride.
127264	128885	Nobody's going to complain about the wet t-shirts.
128905	130746	April is reserved for autistic people.
130926	131346	End of story.
132327	132627	Alright.
133007	133787	So, alright.
134348	135348	No, I'm being silly.
135528	136509	It's like...
138447	142451	I want to do like online pride with air conditioning.
143512	143972	There you go.
144253	144733	Let's go back to 2020.
144833	146014	With extra self-care.
147276	147596	All right.
147956	153542	Well, also practicing some self-care over there by rolling up Katamaris in the background there.
154062	160248	Just one of the all-time best great little cute games that came out of nowhere and just, you know, changed everything.
160288	161469	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
162270	162590	Hello.
162810	163811	Hey, Loki, how are you doing?
164351	164711	Pretty good.
164971	165171	Good.
165191	169093	And of course, I'm referencing the video playing in the background, which is Katamari Damacy.
169133	170234	Or is it one of the sequels?
170314	171474	Beautiful Katamari.
171835	171975	Oh.
172495	176917	And it's because, I mean... We love that game here at OLR.
177337	177738	Exactly.
177938	186982	Aside from we love the game at OLR, I couldn't think of a more fabulous person to showcase but then the king of the cosmos for, you know, Pride Month.
187042	187862	Oh, for Pride Month.
188543	189423	Oh, perfect.
189623	190704	Oh, Loki, ally.
191544	192204	Perfect!
193125	200587	Somebody sent me a message on Instagram and said, I didn't get that joke, and then I searched it on TikTok and I found it, and now it's funny.
200747	202088	So anyway, Loki, ally.
203188	205209	No, happy Pride Month to everybody out there.
205229	207030	I think we kind of said that last week, but you know what?
207510	209430	It's all month long, so I'll probably say it every week.
209731	213312	But anyway, yeah, Katamari Damacy, really one of the all-time great games there.
213952	231724	and uh yeah uh we of course I'm referencing the background of the video and you can see video uh every week as we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific at the Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
232105	242752	Okay uh we have a very very busy week full of news so I want to get into it because it wasn't E3 this week because do you know what the ESA did this week?
245110	249432	Acknowledge their own 30th birthday with a timeline of things that they've done.
249552	250773	That's what they did this week.
250913	252154	Was it empty?
252394	253534	Was it page 404?
254275	257136	It was, you know, it was like, remember when we did E3?
259096	261837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
285908	286709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
302064	302544	I watched them.
302964	304445	I watched them and I... Good.
304485	308206	I'm glad somebody here is on it because I couldn't be bothered apparently.
308766	317149	Summer Games Fest I watched with some of my fellow Channel 64 folks and we also made fun of it because, you know, you have to.
317249	318409	Well, that's what internet people do.
318529	318729	Yeah.
318849	319089	All right.
319129	319530	Exactly.
319630	320450	Break it down for us.
320470	321550	Let's start with Summer Game Fest.
321570	322090	Yeah.
322150	326432	So they kicked it off with LEGO Horizon Adventures, that rumored LEGO...
327532	328832	There's some weird, like...
356263	359364	Side characters that are not necessarily Horizon-based.
359465	364467	It's almost like if you took LEGO Horizons and threw it in LEGO Fortnite.
364607	365467	It's kind of like that.
366608	369289	I don't really understand what the point of the game is, but it looks cool.
369429	373651	Does it look like it has building stuff like LEGO Fortnite?
373751	379234	Yeah, you actually build your own encampment, but it's an encampment with...
380134	383936	Merry Ground or like Carnival Rides and like tents and buildings.
383976	385877	Things I think of when I think of Horizon Zero Dawn.
385917	386477	Exactly.
387337	387937	That was the thing.
388398	397242	What's also interesting about it is, well, first off, it's coming to PC as well, as well as PlayStation 5, but it's also coming to the Switch, which I thought was interesting.
397322	399182	So now we get more cross-platform stuff.
399623	402564	Well, then it can't be that super powered if it's coming to the Switch.
403228	405071	Well, I mean, it does look really good.
405091	407054	I'm sure they're getting a stripped down version of it.
407294	410258	Or, I mean, it is winter 2024.
410298	412201	I mean, maybe it's targeting Switch 2.
412522	412882	Who knows?
412902	413363	You never know.
413904	413964	No.
416797	417597	It's probably fine.
418598	419318	It sounds good.
419358	420379	I'd love to check that game out.
420979	421680	It does look good.
421780	423181	I'm pretty excited for it.
424481	426242	They showed off No More Room in Hell 2.
426383	428824	It's another zombie survival game.
429384	432766	We had Harry Potter Quidditch Champions.
432927	436069	It's a game where you play Quidditch and it's Harry Potter and...
437922	439243	That's coming out this September.
439823	446848	We had a new game from the creator of Choo Choo Charles who put out this game called Cuff Bust.
447089	451932	It is a game where you play koalas and you break out of prison as koalas.
452252	453413	As koalas do.
453573	457296	And you smoke joints because this is the type of humor that we have in 2024.
457416	458918	Hey, that sounds funny.
462091	465574	Anyways, we got another look at Star Wars Outlaws.
465735	469178	Wait, because they're koalas, do they all have over-the-top Australian accents?
470119	477346	I did kind of just... It looked a lot like Fall Guys, almost, in the sense that they're very neon koalas.
478667	483351	They have jumpsuits, but their jumpsuits more look like spacesuits than they... I don't know.
483471	484192	It looked funny.
484212	484292	Like...
485333	487615	You sound like you were a designer on this game, Loki.
487655	489316	This just sounds up your alley a little bit.
489336	489796	I don't know why.
489816	492458	No, like, I mean, it's stupid looking.
492658	493678	And so I don't know.
493999	494859	It's certainly more polished.
494879	496460	Yeah, but like stupid good.
496560	499542	Like the movie Airplane is stupid, but it's stupid funny.
499942	500243	You know?
500303	500523	Yeah.
500663	501283	Yeah.
501443	503064	Star Wars Outlaws have another trailer.
503104	506567	We're going to get more of a look at that tomorrow during the Ubisoft showcase.
508028	513251	We had the sequel to Grizz, which is Neva.
514352	515012	Why not Grizz 2?
515072	518034	No, no Grizz 2.
518294	519475	It's Neva.
520156	520456	Sorry.
520936	521877	It's different, you know.
522197	523418	Neva, give me the name I want.
524228	527129	The game that you're probably very excited for, Civ 7, was...
550157	576139	I can't remember if they ported it later I think it was consoles from the get go and 7 is going to be everything at once so that part is kind of interesting to me just how they have to kind of make it work on consoles as well we got another trailer for Black Myth Wukong which looks awesome I'm really interested to see what that game is going to look like it's not very far off coming out August 20th so that's going to be pretty cool
577274	603242	um once human by starry studios and that's coming out next month a little survivor like a horror game there uh metaphor and uh this was all of the all of the uh persona of course because it is the same studio putting this out um and it's they tried to explain like the different archetypes or whatever that you had in the game but like
604884	609230	It was a lot of over-explanation in the trailer that was just like, I don't understand what's going on.
609651	612455	It's like, I feel the same way when I look at Persona.
612855	614257	It's going to be heavy on the cinematics.
614357	618023	I'm sure if you're a fan of Persona, you're going to be a fan of this.
618043	620005	Which there's a lot of fans of Persona out there.
620746	622188	Exactly.
623090	635888	New Batman Arkham game, which is funny because, you know, of how badly they botched Suicide Squad, but Batman Arkham Shadow coming to the MetaQuest 3 in fall.
637492	641296	It looks okay, but no, I wouldn't buy a system for that.
641616	645801	I appreciate that they're trying to give VR that must-have title, right?
645901	649284	And the Batman Arkham games were, for the most part, pretty darn good.
649905	652407	So I appreciate what they're trying to do.
654149	654650	Godspeed.
655471	656692	Yeah.
656712	656752	Um...
657319	665309	We had a reveal of like at first I was like, is this a new, you know, Fatal Fury game?
665509	676023	But no, we had the reveal for Street Fighter 6, which the new fighter pack, it's going to be including Terry Bogard from Fatal Fury.
677043	682526	My, and M. Bison as well, which is kind of crazy.
682547	684087	M. Bison wasn't already in Street Fighter?
684127	687509	Sorry, I haven't placed Street Fighter 6 as the demo.
687529	689450	I'm kind of shocked he wasn't already in it, to be honest.
690251	697935	Yeah, no, Bison, and Bison looks, you know, it's kind of funny because Bison kind of looks like, I'm like, what is this, Evil Ken again?
698375	701397	Because he's got like a hoodie and everything.
701837	702798	It's Bison with a hoodie.
704366	710893	Mike Deft in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, M. Bison was dead in Street Fighter V, but he got better.
710993	711434	Wait a minute.
711474	712915	Characters don't die.
714016	715018	It's not Mortal Kombat.
715038	715678	Characters don't die.
715698	716860	He's temporarily dead.
717040	719122	Hence why he's alive now.
719142	720103	Yeah, exactly.
720163	720884	It's video games.
721004	722026	They're never really dead.
723007	726389	Yeah, and then also Alina is in there as well.
726609	727650	Oh, cool.
727670	728070	Looks cool.
728610	742858	And I was going to say, I actually, like, my and Terry, like, from Street Fighter, in Street Fighter 6, like, I feel like that's the closest we're ever going to get to a new SNK versus Capcom, so I'm like, I'll fucking take it.
742918	748041	Like, that actually has me more interested in Street Fighter 6 than a lot of news has.
748121	750042	I need to, I legit need to pick that up.
750082	750523	I need to, like,
751303	752787	Grab it next time it's on sale or something.
753929	755012	Yeah.
755252	758861	We have a trailer for Tears of Metal which is...
760958	788589	it's like a Scottish um action game but like it's it felt like I remember the comment that we were making when they were showing this I'm like this seems kind of like this is like a bad stereotype this game like it's just the characters if you can have a you know character that's 150 Scottish that's what this game looked like it was ridiculous it's almost yeah like I said like a stereotype um everybody with a headbutt
789570	815316	it kind of but it's a roguelike uh co-op action game which is a another thing we were making fun of because there's a like almost every game they're showing is like roguelite it's like come on like can we do something different um Dragon Ball like I'm gonna be I'm gonna say it I I know it I'm gonna say it I like roguelikes I'm very brave okay yeah controversial yes uh Dragon Ball Sparking or Sparkling Zero uh
816684	818045	Delta Force Hawk Ops
832546	840870	This just feels like military game word salad that we throw out to actually create a game title.
841590	843031	This also has Black Hawk Down.
843051	845432	Hardcore stealth ops special infantry.
846972	851655	It has a very timely Black Hawk Down campaign mode.
851895	854656	You know, Black Hawk Down, the movie that just came out recently.
854676	856537	The movie from like 15 years ago?
857097	857637	Exactly.
858418	858838	Okay.
860694	862695	But hey, it's... I mean, you know what?
862715	864136	There's a lot of 80s movies.
864176	872081	Like, if they came out and said, like, hey, we're putting, like, Ferris Bueller's Day off into Fortnite, I'd be like, fuck yeah, let's do it.
872561	880266	You know, like, I laugh at that as I'm literally excited for the next campaign of Dimension 20, which is based off of 80s action movies.
880326	882328	So, like, I probably should shut up.
882388	883088	All right, next.
883608	888011	Anyways, speaking of SNK, Fatal Fury, City of Wolves.
888091	888712	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
889545	890946	New game coming out next year.
892647	897631	And we had Battle Crush, which is an isometric character-based battle game.
899152	905336	Mecha Break, which I got excited for because it's a mecha fighting game and it looks awesome and it's fast and...
906016	907577	I'll never play it, but it looked cool.
908098	916584	Then out of nowhere, Blumhouse saying, hey, we're opening a game studio now, and we're showcasing all of these games that we're putting out.
916944	922508	So now Blumhouse Games has many different genre games coming out, a lot of them horror.
924301	946219	and a lot of them kind of throwbacks to like older games there's one that looked like a like almost like a Pokemon game one that was like a 90s um horror like title when it almost looked like uh the original Silent Hill or something like that uh kind of interesting what they're doing with that I like companies that are willing to take risks on different games which is nice
947060	947620	You know what?
947640	950342	Especially with all the news of closures we've had.
950462	955505	And now I realize Blumhouse is publishing, not developing, it sounds like, at least from this.
955965	959047	So it's not exactly like a trade or whatever.
959167	963690	But still, I think they're really hot shit in movies right now.
963830	967552	And yeah, obviously many people in chat right now are talking about Five Nights at Freddy's.
967972	968993	Obviously that did well for them.
969013	972615	They've had a lot of, especially in the horror scene, they've done a lot of big stuff.
973035	975537	So the fact that they're kind of lending that to...
976698	978540	Video Games Now, that is kind of a big deal.
978580	984730	It's going to uplift some of these, you know, what were probably smaller, you know, more indie titles.
985851	986833	This is great.
986873	988455	This is a surprise announcement and a good thing.
989358	1002506	And speaking of like things out of nowhere, so we have a game from Digital Clips and Hasbro Retro Arcade, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Rita's Rewind.
1002806	1005707	It literally is like an arcade game out of the 90s.
1006048	1008429	They made one for the Power Rangers and it looks awesome.
1009069	1010050	It's coming out on PC.
1010550	1013372	It looks like Ninja Turtles, but they put the Power Rangers in it.
1013891	1018676	Yeah, I mean, it looks a little bit like the Super Nintendo game that they came out with a while back.
1019337	1024802	But they also have like some cool things like you're like first person Zord fighting and stuff like that.
1025083	1036114	But with the mode seven stuff in there, it's like I have to OK, so I have to ask our biggest resident Ninja Turtles fan Tiger Claw in chat on a scale of one to ten where ten is hype and one is hype.
1036778	1039060	Um, where, where are you at with the Power Rangers game?
1039500	1040221	I got, I gotta know.
1040801	1042162	Actually, anybody in chat can answer.
1042602	1043463	Anybody in chat can answer.
1043483	1045684	You know, why am I limited, limiting it to one listener?
1046525	1047025	One to ten.
1048066	1049647	Tell me how hype you are for that Power Rangers game.
1049667	1052429	Because it does look, I, you know I love me a retro throwback.
1053110	1054891	And I, yeah, I think that looks cool.
1055651	1055992	So we'll see.
1056552	1057673	Uh, Ranma says ten.
1057853	1059834	DarkTesilla says eight and a half, we'll say.
1060435	1061335	Deft says eight.
1061736	1062997	Bobby Blackwell says three.
1063717	1064037	Hater.
1064538	1064858	It's fine.
1064878	1065618	Okay.
1066559	1068600	but Bobby says I was never a Power Rangers kid.
1068660	1070021	No, I get that.
1070061	1073222	I wasn't either but I like me some retro beam ups.
1073463	1074063	Exactly.
1074943	1075664	S200 Matt says 8.
1076464	1077144	QuestBuster says 8.
1078225	1087570	Tigerclaw says Power Rangers wasn't my thing in the 90s as it was around the time TMNT was in the height of its popularity so he didn't answer the question so I'm going to put a 10 in his place.
1087690	1087970	Alright.
1088630	1089031	Anyway.
1091892	1094613	Then there was a game called Deer and Boy and
1096821	1097090	you know
1097817	1107661	We're making lots of Bambi jokes with this, but yeah, it's going to be one of those like companion, like emotional, deer's going to die at some point, right?
1107801	1108801	You know, it's got to be.
1108861	1110122	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1110182	1112162	The deer's mom will die at some point.
1112182	1113103	The deer's mom will die.
1113123	1114423	Right, right.
1114743	1117624	Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 looks pretty awesome.
1118725	1120426	You know, brutal medieval combat game.
1121506	1123767	And, you know, FPS medieval game.
1124167	1124407	Love it.
1124967	1126928	Another look at Slitherhead.
1127580	1138658	The game by the creator of Silent Hill that kind of resembles a little bit of Parasite Eve to me, but very gory and grotesque.
1139860	1140000	Um...
1140871	1146938	Very interesting that that's going on when, you know, Silent Hill 2 remake, which obviously is, you know, Bloober's taking care of that one.
1147338	1149561	Kind of interesting to see those parallels.
1149701	1157470	But, you know, I'd be curious which one the Silent Hill fan is more excited for because I feel like it's this one for sure.
1157630	1160013	I mean, to me, it's kind of like...
1160433	1183598	you know you have your Silent Hill 2 remake which is like your mighty number nine and then you have your Slitherhead which is kind of like your bloodstained ritual of the night it's you know two two studios kind of taking on you know IP and stuff like that but I think one's gonna be better than the other if you can catch my drift um
1186502	1188243	I will play that Silent Hill 2 remake.
1188984	1190065	It looks good enough.
1192247	1195089	It looks better than the 2 and 3 HD remaster.
1195529	1196350	It looks better than that.
1196931	1198152	Granted, that's a very low bar.
1199052	1212384	And then a game that takes a stupid concept and then executes it extremely well is Killer Bean, which I'm not familiar with the character, but it's essentially like a Max Payne
1213024	1233727	Grand Theft Auto type of game and I'll take it because I don't this had your name written all over it to me I did see this one and I was like this looks like a Loki game because it looks like Grand Theft Auto but stupid I like Grand Theft Auto and stupid but yeah like what Saints Row used to be like it kind of kind of I mean yeah yeah
1236088	1253239	uh then we had Karen uh which is a realistic climbing challenge game oh oh I thought I was like nope nope we made somebody made a customer service game like what is this oh my god you're climbing the mountain to complain to the manager yeah it's
1254379	1257761	How dare, why did a mountain climbing game take that name?
1257861	1260943	Give it back, give it back so someone can make a horror game.
1261424	1271130	To be fair, it is, like, for Karen, it would be spelled really stupid, so it's C-A-I-R-N.
1271290	1278714	It could be a, careful calling it that, because it could be like a language or cultural thing, so...
1279875	1289897	Right, what I'm saying is it's not actually, you know, obviously it's not actually like the name Karen as in what we normally would use unless they were really trying to force that.
1290077	1294998	But no, it's a realistic rock climbing game with like a story to it and stuff.
1295358	1297999	Oh, it's a realistic rock climbing game.
1298059	1301459	So it's, what was the game that was not QWOP but it was something else?
1303220	1303700	Only Up?
1303860	1305000	Or not Only Up?
1305520	1306701	You know what I'm talking about though.
1307021	1307681	Getting Over It?
1307761	1308081	Yeah.
1311348	1328458	he made another a few more games I think so yeah and Quest Buster okay yes a Karen is a pile of rock it is a real term so there it is okay all right yes yeah not so someone can still make the horror game with K-A-R-E-N okay
1330699	1358874	uh okay uh Wander Stop it's a farming sim game with a tea shop management and like some it almost feels like horror elements to it or something because the character they were shown in the trailer seemed to have some sort of like haunted past or something like that but um it looks cute um then we got uh Unknown Nine Awakening a uh fantasy game I honestly like
1360396	1363737	I don't know why they need a subtitle to some of these games.
1363777	1365157	Just call it Unknown 9.
1365477	1367057	I don't know why we need The Awakening.
1367077	1369158	It sounds like you're going to have a franchise or something.
1369218	1372018	But let's see if the game does well first before we do that.
1374779	1376499	Inotria, The Last Song.
1377460	1380740	And they showed off a cinematic trailer for that.
1380900	1382181	That one looked interesting.
1382441	1383741	That was kind of where...
1384738	1385518	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1404171	1406233	The announcement of Outer Sloth.
1406453	1410376	So you may know Inner Sloth, the folks that are behind Among Us.
1411276	1419903	Outer Sloth is their funding, I guess their publishing funding arm, that they're talking about publishing different indie games.
1420643	1428909	So using kind of the money that they've raked in from all of the Among Us stuff, including the TV show, which they showed off a trailer for.
1428990	1429210	Wow.
1430340	1451680	meh like major meh on that um I mean they do have yeah but still consider that that game was made by a team of three people and now they're spending their money on all this stuff like it's pretty pretty uh yeah pretty neat to see that and you have a growth a tv show with Patton Oswalt, Elijah Wood, and Ashley Johnson in it I mean that's you know pretty cool um
1453049	1453329	What else?
1453530	1460958	Oh, Sonic and Shadow or Sonic Cross Shadow Generations or Sonic X Shadow Generations.
1461078	1461398	I don't know.
1462019	1462640	X Cross.
1462860	1465003	I feel like we're in Final Fantasy again.
1465944	1467045	They showed that off again.
1467085	1469367	That's going to be coming out in October.
1470629	1470829	And...
1472611	1472891	DarkSakura,
1496886	1500608	Battle Aces, which they said is like an RTS for everyone.
1501429	1502509	So that's kind of cool.
1502630	1514297	I like an approachable game, whether it be with, for example, Minecraft Dungeons for like, you know, dungeon crawlers, but, you know, RTS games, it'd be nice to have something like that.
1515077	1518401	I mean, isn't Mario and Rabbids kind of an RTS game?
1518802	1534060	I get it, I get it I don't often like to play RTSs because they're a little bit like, yeah, there's a lot in it so yeah, something that kind of peels it back a little bit and simplifies it, I think that's a good idea
1535189	1545980	We've got the Season 3 trailer for the finals, showing off their new map and some new weapons and whatnot that's going to be launching this week.
1547722	1552887	Alan Wake 2 is getting a physical edition, and they announced the Night Springs expansion.
1553008	1555430	Congrats, all of you that held out for the physical edition.
1555470	1555951	You got it.
1556926	1559048	Yeah, it looks kind of crazy.
1559128	1562671	They have all the different characters from the different Remedy games.
1562951	1566193	Rose, Tim Breaker, and Jesse Fadden.
1567234	1569536	And that actually came out yesterday.
1570417	1571638	So that's kind of crazy.
1573299	1577282	New World has an expansion coming that they showed off as well.
1578143	1580785	Honkai Star Rail got another look at that.
1580905	1581926	It's more patches.
1582898	1585969	I'm going to try to skim through this because there's a lot.
1586430	1587373	Just keep going.
1588377	1594339	Dark and Darker, which is like a dungeon crawler game, kind of resembled a little bit of like an Elder Scrolls or something like that.
1594719	1599901	But what's different about this one is it is a extraction game, I think.
1600681	1608864	So it's a dungeon crawler, but you have to get out with the loot that you have, kind of a little bit like the Tarkov or something like that, but in the medieval setting, which is kind of neat.
1609044	1609384	Interesting.
1609404	1612805	It's like Mass Effect multiplayer or something where it's extraction survival.
1612985	1613345	Interesting.
1614505	1616286	We have, let's see...
1617844	1620585	Kunitsu Gami, Path of the Goddess.
1622306	1625728	It's kind of like a sword fighting game from Capcom.
1626709	1635894	And then Hyper Light Breaker was another show that's going to be coming in early access here pretty soon this summer.
1636806	1640107	Party Animals looks fun.
1640308	1643649	A bunch of cute little animals with a bunch of different games that you play.
1644750	1650332	A perfect example of how to waste your trailer time from EA for Skate.
1650832	1654554	They had a trailer with Tim Robbins in it.
1654994	1660997	I love Tim Robbins from I Think You Should Leave and stuff like that.
1661537	1662758	Or not I Think You Should Leave.
1663378	1664498	Tim Robinson, I'm sorry.
1667412	1695261	it's just they spent this four minute trailer they spent three and a half minutes with this weird sketch talking about M-Court basically abandoning a city but not really abandoning a city and then 30 seconds showing off that oh hey we're still working on the game and there's gonna be beta testing coming out you know this fall or something like that it's like did we really need all this stuff did you really need to spend the budget marketing this you know it was funny but
1696775	1704334	I don't know, it seems like a waste Also, for the crowd that goes back and watches things I don't bother with this type of stuff, right?
1705436	1705938	Exactly
1707317	1716103	Pal Worlds getting an expansion, the Sakurajima update, brand new island, new pals, new fun stuff there.
1716944	1720206	Also dedicated servers for Xbox as well, new raids.
1720366	1726110	All that news made me do is go, I am shocked that Nintendo apparently is not going to do anything about this game.
1726750	1733454	I really was convinced they were just waiting and building the case, but it seems clear and clear they're not going to stop it.
1733594	1735716	I'm kind of shocked, actually.
1740136	1763270	Valorant, they talked about some more updates with that as well also it's going to be coming to Xbox and Playstation 5 next week so June 14th and then Monster Hunter Wilds we got a look at that as well and it certainly looks like a very impressive looking Monster Hunter game
1764286	1766868	Yeah, there's a lot of people that are going to be into that one for sure.
1766988	1768969	I wish I could get more into Monster Hunter because of the mobile.
1769270	1771831	Again, I hope they put out a demo or something so I can try it.
1771912	1772632	And they usually do.
1772772	1774874	The last two Monster Hunter games I think have had demos.
1774894	1777696	So I'd like to try it and see if maybe it clicks for me this time.
1777796	1778476	But we'll see.
1780318	1789024	And then finally, Phantom Blade Zero, which looks like a fantasy Japanese or feudal Japanese game.
1789827	1789967	Civ 7
1814602	1823148	I think obviously you know you know I love me some Civ which I did suggest last week by the way Civ 7 would be a great time to announce right now so yay
1824969	1826810	Alright, well there's more!
1826991	1832374	That was one, so then right after that, well this one was, I mean there was still a lot in this, but Day of the Devs, right?
1832875	1833835	Day of the Devs, yes.
1833955	1838038	So there was some more games shown off, Day of the Devs, more indie games of course.
1838559	1840380	So I'm going to just go through some of these real fast.
1841001	1846645	We had Battle Vision Network by Capybara Games, a 1v1 puzzle battler game.
1847185	1850888	And it kind of, they say it looks like Might and Magic Clash of Heroes.
1852719	1854483	Oh, I haven't thought about that game in a while.
1854523	1855866	That was a fun little puzzle game.
1856067	1857350	It definitely looks cute.
1858051	1859655	So that's, you know,
1860475	1862076	I am 8-bit, it's a retro-styled RPG
1884228	1890712	where we play a motorbike courier delivering flower pedal or flower powered digital pets.
1891833	1894534	So it's like for people that love their old school Pokemon.
1894995	1897416	Yeah, you know, it's got the Pokemon vibes for sure.
1898877	1900318	Karma, The Dark World.
1900858	1904380	It's a scary game.
1905341	1906161	That's what they say.
1906221	1906561	I don't know.
1906601	1907502	There's no screenshots.
1908103	1929289	but um yeah it's interesting this one's kind of cool i saw uh some of the screenshots from this ufo 50 so it is a game by moss mouth and it's a 50 in one game like collection but it's like all these like fake not fake games but like they made 50 different games within this collection it's kind of like those kind of um
1931465	1934787	I don't know, like the minigame collections you would find out there.
1934868	1936269	Like a clubhouse games type of thing?
1936309	1939831	Yeah, like clubhouse games, but these are actual retro-style games.
1940151	1941853	Not necessarily like cards.
1942053	1948478	Yeah, the one I'm looking at looks like Super Dodgeball, which was one of my favorite old-school NES-era games.
1950099	1951280	And one of the Kunio games.
1951540	1953942	Yes, yeah.
1954062	1956163	Do they all have anything in common, like a Kunio game?
1956203	1959246	Or is it just a mishmash of curated games?
1960356	1989135	I don't know if they have a anything in common I'm trying to see real quick because I've like no they all look like they're from they all look retro they all essentially have like the same like block palette so it's like kind of a a hybrid between like a Super Nintendo and like a NES like Pixel Poops number two could have been in this except these are all widescreen games they're not three or four by three games probably better than Pixel Poops number two but yes yes for sure
1990243	2015070	um okay so uh yeah i mean yeah there's like a lot of these different games kind of resemble stuff that i've played on the um nes and it's by a bunch of different developers as well so like from the creators like they said of splunky downwell time barons and i've never heard of this score plaque and madhouse um
2015987	2044947	so it's like a lot of developers just putting together like 50 brand new games they say these are not mini games or micro games although the size of each game varies everyone has a complete experience with its own title screen intro and ending some are small arcade style games but there are also larger open world adventures and JRPGs that could take many hours to beat interesting all right that's awesome I'm excited um what else let's see uh
2046328	2052108	we have a ranger which is a it's a
2054830	2057792	I guess, I wonder if this is from Furniture and Mattress.
2059252	2062454	You're navigating a world by shifting rows and columns.
2063694	2071578	It says the team has Braid artists and Karto writer on board.
2071798	2072518	Okay, well, cool.
2072658	2075079	I was going to say, the art looks very like Braid.
2075199	2075439	Yeah.
2076080	2076280	Yeah.
2077667	2104874	uh let's see there is one I'm trying to figure out which one oh this one's cool yeah Screenbound a game um where you walk around while holding kind of like what looks like a Game Boy um it's like a 3D world but then there's a 2D version that you're playing as well and they kind of link together which is interesting oh that's clever that's clever yeah so it's kind of kind of an interesting platforming game there um
2106328	2106749	What else?
2107149	2108450	There's so many games.
2108531	2111654	Like, I cannot stress how many games are here.
2112695	2117521	Quoria is published by Dotnod, a stylistic isometric adventure game.
2118282	2123527	We have Zuchosis from Clapperheads that...
2125069	2154251	it's a horror game and apparently you're like a zookeeper but there's like horror stuff like they say here a giraffe turns into a spider monster and kangaroos with giant mouth bellies I don't like animals like that I don't know I would suggest going through these and probably just checking out a lot of the stuff because there may be stuff that you're going to find that you know that we
2154727	2155688	We probably didn't cover.
2155708	2165456	There is, in fact, actually kind of going off tangent here, so I did try to check out some of the other ones as well, like the PC Gaming Showcase and
2167079	2171982	Devolver Digital was doing their thing, their weird thing, as they normally do.
2172902	2176144	PC Gaming Showcase was so boring, I couldn't get through it.
2177385	2183309	The problem is they're trying to be like Devolver Digital, but they're just not funny, and that's the problem.
2183929	2186510	Whereas Devolver at least had some cool games to look at.
2186550	2191894	So one of them that I thought, Robby, probably be something you might be interested in is called Crush House.
2192614	2196978	So the Crush House, it's essentially a dark comic dating life sim.
2197418	2199741	Imagine you're filming Big Brother.
2200141	2212852	And so you get to kind of edit and push people in different ways to get them to fight with each other in the Crush House or fall in love with each other and kind of...
2213533	2218939	You know, twist how people are viewed on the show and stuff like that.
2219139	2222703	And so it's kind of set in the year 1999 as well.
2222743	2224524	And you take the role of a producer.
2224705	2226006	I think that was the year.
2226667	2230711	No, that was the year before like Survivor and all that stuff debuted.
2230991	2231392	So yeah.
2231972	2243139	Yeah, it says players will have to choose between 4 of 12 personalities to cast for each season of the show, trying to mix and match personalities to attract and create the most entertaining segments of reality TV.
2244119	2245520	Sounds dumb as fuck, I'm into it.
2247001	2252264	And there's a free demo that's currently on Steam, so you can check it out now.
2252665	2253985	And the game's coming out August 9th.
2255166	2256827	Yeah, definitely, it sounds like work.
2257488	2257728	Yeah.
2260387	2262773	Rob, you play it and you tell us what it's like, okay?
2262953	2264257	Alright, I will.
2265526	2277435	The only other thing I was going to name that I think caught my eye that Loki missed during the Day of the Devs, which is fine because there's a lot of stuff, is the game Afterlove EP because that game has rhythm game elements in it.
2277715	2279957	That might be of interest to some of our fans.
2280397	2283439	Although it doesn't look like it's actually a rhythm game.
2283900	2288283	It looks like it is kind of more of a narrative adventure, but it has rhythm elements in it.
2288403	2290205	So that's just one that caught my eye.
2290985	2293747	There was another one that came up on my YouTube feed today.
2293947	2299391	I don't know if it was announced at one of these events, but they just put out their announcement trailer.
2299951	2301332	It's called Unbeatable.
2301692	2307076	It is a game by D-Cell, and it is a rhythm action game.
2307356	2309277	I love their tagline on here.
2309357	2312680	It's a game where music is illegal and you do crimes.
2313300	2314461	But it looks cool.
2314561	2317943	The art style is very well done.
2318323	2319704	It reminds me a lot of...
2322546	2326347	Oh, Hi-Fi Rush, but not like that style of presentation.
2326628	2328608	It's not like a 3D beat-em-up game.
2328748	2333471	It's more of like a 2D, definitely more story-based.
2333571	2335992	I think there is also another one called...
2337895	2349701	Questbuster in chat calls one out as well Mike Laidlaw from Dragon Age fame also showed off his new RPG Eternal Strands on Friday it looks like it borrows a bit from Shadow of the Colossus and merges it with action combat and magic
2366391	2367751	We're going to get into another big one.
2367871	2368392	Oh, sorry.
2370012	2374034	We're going to get into another big one in a minute here, but you all asked questions and I got answers.
2374114	2376436	So you asked, what does Shane think of the Power Rangers game?
2376556	2381738	And the reason why you might want to know his opinion is he used to host a show here on the network called Ranger Pride.
2381778	2382999	He co-hosted that with Spike.
2383439	2388261	Obviously, it sunsetted some time ago, but he's kind of our resident Power Rangers fanboy.
2388302	2392924	So I texted him, of course, and I said, listeners want to know your thoughts on Power Rangers game.
2393124	2394164	Here's the response I got.
2396550	2397550	That's the response I got.
2397590	2399411	So, of course, I was like, what's that?
2399711	2400191	Why that?
2400871	2416294	He says, it's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and also... So, if you kind of know Shane, it's one of those things where it's like he... The Mighty Morphin that was big here, they've obviously done all these other iterations of Power Rangers and Sentai since then.
2416874	2419995	So, it's kind of the same thing about why is it always Gen 1 with Pokemon?
2420015	2420835	Why does it always count?
2420855	2421815	So, it's part that...
2422595	2440112	and he says it's MMPR and also Hasbro killed the brand anyway so it's hard to care regardless so there's some other I kind of equal that I liked the Japanese series and never really cared for the US you know whatever they did to it so that's kind of the way I feel about it too
2440552	2444614	So I guess it really is nostalgia bait for many people.
2444734	2447055	But anyway, you asked the opinion there, so there it is.
2447695	2449856	Let's get into today's showcase from Xbox.
2449876	2453118	Let me just say though at the top to break it up a little bit because we've just been going game after game after game.
2453638	2458280	I will say, well, let me ask this, Loki, because you actually watched it and I can't say here.
2458321	2459121	I did watch this one, yeah.
2459401	2461062	Well, oh, I thought you watched Summer Game Fest too.
2462015	2485472	I watched Summer Game Fest and I watched this one so I'm curious like overall what was your thoughts on Summer Game Fest because to me it sounded a little like it's easy for me to come out here and say it didn't sound like it was a very strong showing but I also realized that with the industry like pretty fucked right now as far as like layoffs all these other types of things that it's going to take some
2486372	2487573	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2505009	2509290	It's... I mean, I don't know if it's... I mean, sort of, I get that.
2509430	2517733	Like, I think going into it with the expectations that I had, which was not much, it was fine.
2517953	2522214	It didn't really necessarily meet my expectations, but once again, I had no expectations.
2523314	2525635	If you went in thinking, oh, we're going to see Grand Theft Auto 6...
2526715	2527116	No.
2527376	2530178	Well, then you were an idiot and you deserved what you got.
2530238	2532420	I'm just going to tell you, I'm going to break it down for a bit.
2532460	2532920	I'm sorry.
2533120	2535782	If you went in with that high of a bar, you deserved what you got.
2536663	2537424	Exactly.
2539205	2545209	It's nice to see that there's a lot of independent titles, and that's the thing with a lot of these games that we're talking about.
2545310	2545810	It's not...
2547165	2547645	and so on.
2566471	2584400	certainly there are the bigger games that are going to be we're going to be talking about some here pretty soon but it is these indie studios and these up and coming games that are going to hopefully shed a light on some of this practice that's going on because right now what's unfortunate is we have all these big
2586384	2597919	that are just like, hey, we're going all in on live service and we're going all in on the microtransactions and we're going all in on not innovating and we're just going to pump out with safe and do that.
2598320	2599581	Isn't the industry kind of
2600242	2600863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2630485	2630905	and so on.
2649605	2658555	I think that you can see the interference by higher-ups and decisions made that just really screwed with that game.
2658655	2664641	And same with even Redfall recently had the same type of issues.
2664681	2670827	You can see the influence by the C-suite or whatever on these games that have just destroyed it.
2670927	2671908	And unfortunately...
2672549	2676853	We're not in a world where everything's perfect and these people take accountability for their dumb decisions.
2676873	2678775	I wish employees could sue executives.
2679075	2684180	I realize with at-will employment and all that's never be the case.
2684440	2687122	Y'all can spare me the legal talk on why that isn't happening.
2687603	2688704	But I can say I wish.
2689184	2690926	I can say that would...
2691826	2698671	It's just, it's just, it's shitty that more executives out there aren't taking the brunt for what they forced in games, but I'm preaching to the choir.
2698731	2704995	Anyway, let me go back to what E3VL said in chat, which is especially Sony canceling a lot of live service.
2705095	2707997	Yeah, that also kind of shows like the pause, right?
2708378	2710699	On the bubbles bursting on this.
2710759	2711660	We got to pull this back.
2712140	2717944	Anyway, we're going to get into the Xbox stuff of which, you know, I can, I'll speak just general and overall real quick.
2717984	2719806	Just, you know, again, kind of looking at everything.
2721227	2727214	It's weird with Microsoft because that whole taste of the layoffs and everything still kind of burns.
2728195	2728856	It does.
2729477	2731540	It's hard to watch this in some ways.
2732220	2734383	But at the same time... Go ahead.
2735084	2738468	No, I was going to say, like when the two executives...
2739289	2751855	that were part of, like, so you have the head of Xbox Game Studios, you have the other one that was, like, the head of, like, Xbox or whatever, I don't remember what division she, yeah, so you had those two.
2752075	2754517	When they came on screen, I was pissed off to see them.
2754577	2757338	Like, honestly, like, I was just, like, I really wish you were on this.
2757718	2760600	What purpose do you have to spout, like, garbage right now?
2760960	2761900	Just show the trailers.
2761940	2763401	Like, I don't really need you here.
2763841	2775169	or that maybe in this limelight showing moment where all eyes are on you, why not have some of your frontline employees be introducing these games?
2775689	2776330	How about that?
2778031	2779051	I like that idea.
2780012	2781833	You know, but I get what you're saying.
2781893	2784015	Like there's this, yeah, I get it.
2784075	2789959	It was like, it was a pointless break between like trailers for them to come and say just literally just,
2790967	2792267	Corporate garbage.
2792287	2799009	It had no meaning other than like, oh, we have a new Xbox thing coming out or a new system lineup.
2799529	2800909	I don't need you to tell me that.
2801009	2802770	Also, I don't want to see your face right now.
2803090	2803910	It is too soon.
2804270	2805230	We're fighting, yeah.
2805850	2806310	Exactly.
2806370	2807911	It's just, I don't know.
2807951	2809491	It just felt really toned up.
2809531	2812252	It's weird that all that can be true, yet...
2813112	2814674	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2831812	2832793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2852791	2868420	and I think they did very well and it seems like a lot of reaction online is even from the most Xbox skeptical people you know there might be comments on the things we were just talking about which is completely understandable but overall it's like the games they were showing were like yeah this is uh they got a lot of good shit coming
2869831	2872212	Maybe it's because they own half the industry at this point.
2872292	2872612	I don't know.
2873192	2873652	But anyway.
2874192	2874512	Maybe.
2875672	2886555	Yeah, so Xbox Showcase started off strong with Call of Duty Black Ops 6 taking place during the post-Cold War and during the George H.W.
2886635	2888075	Bush administration era.
2889756	2890036	You know,
2890851	2914191	basically you know they show their campaign trailer off and stuff like that looks like Call of Duty I mean so what can I really say of course confirming that it is going to be on Game Pass day one the game I'm most excited for out of everything that they've showed off so far Doom the Dark Ages this was that rumored game that was supposed to be shown basically Doom set in you know
2914771	2916714	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2926733	2927754	It's kind of crazy.
2927814	2937401	So you have, you know, Doomguy with a shotgun and the brand new kind of chainsaw shield thing that he can throw like Captain America's shield.
2938002	2938522	I'm there.
2939083	2940244	It sounds awesome.
2940304	2941124	It looks awesome.
2941925	2944667	So that's going to be something that's coming out next year.
2945908	2946408	I'm excited.
2946709	2951252	That's actually one, which is weird because like I'm not, I didn't play Doom Eternal or anything like that.
2951332	2954255	It looks like I recognize that it's a good game, but
2954995	2955695	Dragon Age The Veil Guard
2976809	2977790	Starfield, Shattered Space
2996464	3010741	which is going to be kind of more of a horror focused on that that's going to be launching later this year also there's going to be a free update that's out now that they did with some more bounties and some other stuff with that
3011341	3016042	Quickly, Quest Buster, also, because I do want to bring this up, mentions about Dragon Age, Veil Guard.
3016442	3028325	It's coming out near the end of this year, too, which it's almost shocking and hard to believe that finally we have a release of this year for that game, because it feels like the game's been in development forever, but that it was never coming out.
3029085	3035087	I believe they're going to show gameplay later this week, and I'm a little more interested in gameplay than story trailers, so we'll see.
3036087	3036307	Yeah.
3037510	3052622	Fallout 76 is getting a map expansion with Skyline Valley which they said is set in Shenandoah and they also showed off Vault 63 as well which is going to be a new vault and also tease at the very end of that trailer you can play as a ghoul soon.
3055244	3065692	Another interesting looking game called Expedition 33 essentially it's got Ben Starr in it and
3068086	3092586	Happy Pride and it's a fantasy game where essentially some sort of creature named I think is the artist or the painter or something like that counts down every year and apparently when they count down everybody that's that age or older well I guess not older everyone that's that age dies wasn't that the plot of the Maze Runner?
3094387	3095728	I don't know I never watched the Maze Runner
3098717	3100758	We got some gameplay.
3101059	3103080	Yeah, it's a turn-based RPG, right?
3103100	3104141	Which is what people want.
3104161	3104621	Yes, yes.
3104901	3105982	So that's, there you go.
3106322	3107443	It's a turn-based RPG.
3108404	3108844	I want it.
3108964	3109865	I want to play that.
3110025	3110926	Turn-based, Ben Star.
3112026	3112327	Here's your $70.
3112367	3112587	Yes.
3112647	3115269	Or is it a Game Pass game?
3116389	3117770	Well, I mean, all these are Game Pass games.
3118051	3119932	Oh.
3119972	3120232	Right.
3121053	3121293	Yeah.
3121693	3122854	All of these are Game Pass games.
3123635	3123815	Um...
3124582	3127344	Oh, it's Logan's Run, not The Maze Runner, sorry.
3127464	3130426	I mixed up my old school sci-fi films.
3130466	3136630	Logan's Run was more of like when you're 25, I think, or whatever, you get taken somewhere and shot.
3136730	3142154	This is like, when you're of a certain age, you get Thanos snapped out of existence.
3142194	3143675	You know, that's the difference here.
3144196	3146017	Better than throwing yourself off a cliff when you're 70.
3146617	3147818	How is that different?
3149900	3150160	Anyway.
3151372	3152473	One's more instantaneous.
3152594	3153555	Okay.
3153855	3155817	We got gameplay of South of Midnight.
3156177	3161322	That's that kind of very stylistic game set and kind of like the bayou, that type of thing.
3161923	3162524	Looks cool.
3162664	3164265	It's going to be coming out in 2025.
3167759	3178731	We have the trailer for the World of Warcraft, The War Within, the new expansion that's going to be coming out later this year in August 26th on PC.
3180153	3185819	I was going to mention, though, as a quick aside, I'm surprised I didn't see Overwatch at all during this whole thing.
3186400	3203700	that's one thing to note we didn't need her showing up and ruining the mood fair enough uh we got a trailer or gameplay trailer have you ever been to a party and then a certain person shows up and is like god the vibe just got killed it's you oh oh her
3205089	3205830	This bitch.
3207671	3212735	They're actually changing the name of Overwatch to Oh Her.
3213416	3215097	Oh Her Watch.
3216358	3220801	We got Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.
3221602	3225324	And that's, of course, the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.
3226264	3227725	And some gameplay with that.
3228025	3230607	I mean, yeah, it looks like Snake Eater.
3230827	3235029	So, you know, as long as we have the song in there, which I know we will, that's all I need.
3236109	3239591	CFE Season 13, they showed that off where you can be bad.
3239991	3243493	You get a big bad ship now and you can do bad things.
3243773	3247035	At first, like I thought, was this the whole...
3248275	3249216	or not Pirates of the Caribbean.
3250216	3251837	Sometimes it's good to be bad.
3253258	3253878	What was the game?
3255919	3256419	I can't remember.
3256600	3257200	LucasArts game.
3259921	3260462	Monkey Island.
3260542	3260962	That's right.
3261542	3265984	I thought it was that all over again because the one pirate guy looked like LeChuck.
3266825	3268726	But it's not because they've already done that in a previous season.
3268746	3270747	Like three times, yeah.
3270987	3272048	Well, hey, four times.
3272268	3272528	Why not?
3272888	3273849	Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.
3274249	3274969	I'm not bad.
3275189	3276290	I'm just drawn that way.
3279311	3282154	We had Flintlock, The Siege of Dawn.
3282614	3289840	It's a I guess they say it's a fusing melee weaponry and guns.
3290620	3293562	I feel like they showed this at a previous thing.
3294063	3296565	Yeah, it looked familiar.
3296905	3306432	Age of Mythology Retold looks like an original or it's a remake of the 2002 game and that's going to be coming out on September 4th.
3307691	3313313	We got gameplay, I think, sort of, of Perfect Dark.
3313954	3320576	It looks different than I remember the last Perfect Dark game I played, which is from the Xbox 360.
3320656	3324218	So I don't know what this Perfect Dark is anymore, but it looks good.
3324958	3325698	So cool.
3327259	3334882	We got the intro, I think, for Diablo 4, the new expansion, the Vessel of Hatred.
3336075	3338197	So they did a little cinematic for that?
3338358	3351251	Okay, so as the Resident Diablo 4 fan, I will say that I don't usually care about cinematics, but Blizzard Cinematic in particular has always knocked it out of the park, and this one was very, very fucking good.
3351872	3354814	Diablo 4 News Diablo 4 News Diablo 4 News Diablo 4 News
3371479	3373801	They stealth dropped pets on the game.
3374441	3377263	So they just released pets into the game today.
3377563	3381366	They put out a 3 gig patch and now you can finally get a pet dog.
3381406	3383367	So they have a quest to do a pet dog.
3383708	3384969	How do you get other pets?
3385089	3387030	By pre-ordering the expansion, of course.
3387110	3390192	Or pre-purchasing, excuse me, because that's the thing that Blizzard does.
3390452	3393294	Pre-purchasing the expansion, you can get different pets.
3393455	3393715	But...
3394255	3397716	You can get a very good dog friend for free in the game right now.
3397776	3399997	It is a quest that takes you five seconds to do.
3400297	3402438	The quest is literally, you found a dog.
3402878	3403658	That's it.
3404379	3410461	And most importantly, the tutorial teaches you you can interact with the dog.
3410541	3413702	So yes, if you say hello to the dog, you actually pet the dog.
3416072	3440170	I'm glad developers realize that this like in the year 2024 like what's fucking important so like they realize like never mind that the dog picks up the gold and the crafting stuff for you which is a very good quality of life improvement in Diablo never mind that's if they just want to let you know you can pet the fucking dog yes you can that's it that's all that matters and that was the best news out of this entire week
3442998	3467005	we got more of a story trailer for the new Fable game and it's been confirmed hopefully to be coming next year I do not sorry I muted myself from clapping I do not want another goddamn story trailer for Fable gameplay gameplay gameplay it looks neat
3467492	3468314	But yeah, I'm with you.
3468334	3473663	How's Hellblade 2 selling, by the way, after all that rollout?
3474324	3476047	No talking about Hellblade 2 either.
3476067	3478871	And then no fucking hype when it comes out.
3479977	3480577	Hey, there you go.
3480817	3490741	See, instead of having, was it Matt Booty in there for a few seconds to say some absolute trash that means literally nothing, you could have put, hey, do you remember that Hellblade 2 is out?
3490981	3494622	Do you remember that game we hyped like 10 times and it came out?
3494783	3497283	Did you know that game came out and it's available now on Game Pass?
3497303	3497764	Go get it.
3498544	3500385	Like, yeah, seriously, I 100% agree with you, Logie.
3503049	3503709	Yeah, it's dumb.
3504669	3518212	They showed off a new 5v5 hero shooter, yay, called Frag Punk, but it has a unique twist to it at least, where you get these cards that essentially dynamically change the game.
3518733	3529375	So they had one that shows it flips the world upside down, or one that adds electricity to your bullets or something like that, or big head mode so you can get easier headshots.
3529915	3530775	That looks kind of neat.
3531536	3533376	So that's Frag Punk.
3534697	3543121	Winter Burrow, which is a cute little mouse survival game and a farming sim.
3544141	3545822	Not really sure much about that.
3546702	3547803	This one was really cool.
3547863	3557527	So Mixtape, which is a kind of a... It feels very like...
3558928	3585627	Life is Strange almost but it's you know kind of like a slice of life you know in the 90s uh it's got that kind of uh I don't know like Life is Strange almost type of thing but it's got a really cool soundtrack as well to go along with it so they got Devo, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, um Suzy and the Banshees, Joy Division and more
3587353	3588454	and looks fun.
3589294	3590975	Help me show my age through this game.
3591015	3591416	Thank you.
3595638	3596679	And that's by Annapurna.
3597079	3612048	So we got Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and they showed off some of the new stuff with that, including a lot of the different, you know, occupations that you can play around with in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
3612588	3619517	So, like, you know, they have agriculture, aviation, cargo transport, search and rescue.
3619537	3628950	Sorry, unintentional Xbox noise on the thing there, but I was like, oh, right, I forgot that this was announced, and I have not watched the footage for this game yet, because...
3630066	3646238	Flight Simulator games are always like oh my god the graphics in these games are so fucking good I had to like see like what this looks like because oh my god Flight Simulator like the problem Flight Simulator is kind of a hard game
3646738	3647139	Fight Seeing Mode
3665541	3683412	but god it's so seriously they need to just have a mode where you just like rocket man mode where you just fly around the world in a jetpack with unlimited fuel because it's so beautiful so beautiful anyway I could just
3685444	3687246	I just want to get high and play this game.
3687386	3689708	Let's just call it what it is.
3689728	3691809	Let's just call it what it is.
3693310	3697554	I just want to chill out and just watch the pretty visuals.
3698014	3699676	You want to get high and get high.
3700136	3701377	High in altitude, of course.
3701437	3701978	That's right, yes.
3702318	3704299	I want to get high in altitude in a video game.
3704400	3707522	I would never endorse anything else.
3707582	3709083	Rob, it's legal.
3709664	3710725	I know, but still.
3712786	3713367	At least here it is.
3714597	3718863	Then we had the new expansion for Elder Scrolls Online, Gold Road.
3719043	3721566	That's going to be coming out here in a couple weeks.
3721887	3722608	Nine days, actually.
3722668	3723329	June 18th.
3724330	3725612	Hold up, hold up.
3725632	3726753	We're going back to Flight Simulator.
3727694	3730218	That came up in conversation yesterday, actually, that game.
3730748	3734251	Why is there a mode in Flight Simulator where you're taking pictures of Bambi?
3734751	3735311	What is this?
3735331	3736152	That's not flying?
3736612	3741636	This is what you do when you... Because there's a photo mode, but then there's deer.
3741816	3745659	Can I just play... Can Microsoft just give me that fucking game?
3745839	3747300	Because that looks really good.
3747321	3749822	Just world travel the game where you go and take pictures of things?
3749842	3751263	Take pictures of pretty shit.
3751504	3752384	That's all I want.
3754506	3755307	Take an edible...
3756300	3757661	and Take Pictures of Pretty Shit.
3757881	3759122	That's the game I want to play.
3759482	3761563	Like, what is wrong with developers?
3761583	3765886	Or how about you could just fly to, like, Forza Horizons and then go take pictures in that.
3765926	3767787	You could be a spectator in Forza Horizons.
3767827	3769488	Let's just cross the games over, you know?
3770429	3770729	Oh, no.
3771029	3773090	I love a good photo mode, though.
3773130	3775572	Like, I've been going to town with that Avatar game.
3776172	3777973	They even have the fucking northern lights.
3778073	3778393	Like, this...
3780725	3781486	It is gorgeous.
3781506	3783007	This game does not get enough credit.
3783047	3783488	It's so good.
3783528	3785610	Okay, I'm sorry to derail everything, but also I'm not.
3785650	3790974	And it's great because it's so immersive because your computer sounds like it's taking off when it's running the game.
3791074	3796679	So it's, you know, it's the feeling of immersion of the jet engines going.
3797840	3801143	You can play it on an Xbox Series X or through the cloud or something.
3801543	3805186	It won't look as good in the cloud, but you can play it on a Series X, I'm sure.
3806207	3806467	Anyway.
3806748	3806888	Yeah.
3808621	3813183	Alright, sorry, I derailed whatever other thing you were talking about, but taking pictures of Bambi is important.
3813623	3816804	Yeah, so Elder Scrolls Online Gold Road coming out in nine days.
3817384	3828008	Life is Strange Double Exposure, which is apparently, you know, a story with Max, who is now dealing with like an alternate reality where she's trying to figure out, you know,
3828581	3829522	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3852176	3856318	It certainly looks better than the movies, or at least the new movies.
3856618	3858800	The recent movies, not the old movies.
3859620	3862942	But I'm down, so it looks cool.
3864603	3869825	We got another look at Mecha Break, but that was in the other showcase.
3870606	3876609	Wuchang Fallen Feathers, which is kind of like some Bloodborne-looking game.
3877705	3884786	We've got the briefest trailer possible for Avowed, which the entire time we were traveling, like, is this Elder Scrolls?
3885366	3886366	Is this Elder Scrolls?
3887767	3891567	But no, it's not Elder Scrolls because it's sort of Elder Scrolls, but not.
3891987	3893648	It's very Elder Scrolls.
3893808	3906770	And then to go along with that, to even confuse me even more of games that are sort of Bethesda, but not Bethesda, we have a game that looks like Fallout, but in London, which I was like, is this...
3908084	3908844	What I think it is.
3909124	3915946	But no, it's another game franchise called Atomfall, which is essentially like Fallout, but in London.
3916367	3920548	And they have big robots and all sorts of weird stuff going on.
3922408	3923129	That looks cool.
3923329	3924049	I'll check that out.
3924369	3925889	But I'm surprised it's not Fallout.
3927230	3929550	Another trailer for Assassin's Creed Shadows.
3929590	3931331	We'll probably see more of that stuff later.
3931596	3935799	Tomorrow, we got a gameplay trailer of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
3935819	3937000	2, Heart of Chernobyl.
3937681	3938681	It looked pretty cool.
3939862	3944426	We got the announcement of the Xbox Series X and S hardware refresh.
3944906	3950350	So they're going to be doing three new consoles refreshes.
3950891	3958176	So there is an Xbox Series X, all digital, so it looks like a refrigerator with a door you can't open.
3960237	3980805	and that's gonna be in white what if they had a tiny little refrigerator where the drive used to be where you could cool like one can of Mountain Dew like that's that's the Xbox I need I mean they have the refrigerator already that looks like the Xbox Series X that's true that's true it's just gonna be confusing I've been tempted to buy that fridge is this the game system I don't know it's like it's both um
3983001	3984702	But yeah, that's going to be coming out with a one.
3985022	3992707	They're also going to have a one terabyte Series S in robot white, which I was like, wasn't the Series S always in white?
3992747	3993828	But apparently it's not.
3994088	3995028	Apparently they had.
3995829	3996049	Wow.
3996289	4000012	Several people in chat, by the way, telling me that that Xbox fridge is not worth it.
4000072	4001713	Bobby Blackwell says it's not a mini fridge.
4001833	4002673	It's just a cooler.
4003053	4004234	I bought it and I was disappointed.
4004294	4006115	Pod Culture says, Rob, it ain't that great.
4006796	4007216	All right.
4007276	4007616	Damn.
4008157	4008637	Shut me up.
4010032	4031469	and then they also had a special edition Xbox Series X in Galaxy Black with 2TB of storage and a disk drive and what you may ask is Galaxy Black, it's like someone put their Xbox Series X next to some place where someone was spray painting and some little particulates of the spray paint got onto the Xbox
4033348	4034829	Yay!
4035350	4035710	Okay.
4036350	4038012	Well, that's also $600.
4038192	4039953	The bigger storage, I guess, is neat.
4040613	4047459	Yeah, I mean, two terabytes, I guess, is nice when you consider that, you know, Black Ops 6 is 300 gigabytes.
4047639	4049420	So, you know.
4050609	4075477	that's what that's that folks for you with the wonderful Xfinity that's a third of your month's download isn't that great isn't it great to be gaming in the future just just wait until you see the game size of that fucking flight simulator game that's all I have to say and then last but not least the one more thing was Gears of War E-Day it is a prequel was it really a surprise though
4077533	4081517	I wasn't expecting because I've completely forgotten about Gears of War, so it's fine.
4083564	4084285	Well, there you go.
4084385	4085946	Wow, a lot going on there.
4085986	4086426	You know what?
4086706	4088587	Gears of War, a game that exists.
4088688	4091069	Well, I will say the biggest shock is that it's not Gears of War 6.
4091509	4092630	It's Gears of War Subtitle.
4094291	4096613	So, yeah, you know what?
4096653	4098754	It sounds like it was actually a really good commercial for Game Pass.
4098995	4110843	I mean, I know not everything is a game, because like Assassin's Creed, I don't think those games usually go to Game Pass, but it sounds like there was a good chunk of things they showed that they are going to Game Pass, and I think Game Pass definitely needs that kick in the butt right now, so that's neat.
4113911	4115318	so, alright
4116601	4121663	Well, lots and lots of announcements this week and definitely sets up what the rest of the year is going to look like.
4121723	4125445	Of course, we're waiting to see if Nintendo will perhaps announce something.
4125765	4135709	You know, I was looking at our Discord because we do, you know, we not only take your calls on Discord, but we also chat with you guys throughout the week at our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4136089	4142932	And I saw in our chat, somebody had posted that I guess on Reddit, somebody had leaked a Nintendo Direct.
4143032	4144092	This happens every time.
4144112	4145533	And I'm going to tell you, I looked at that list.
4146528	4148309	and it's not real.
4149090	4152432	And I'm sure it's very, very obvious that it's not real and there's a hundred of these.
4152512	4153153	It's not real.
4154073	4160217	And the reason why it's not real is because number one, it has an F-Zero GX remaster on it and that game's never coming out.
4160717	4162499	That's one reason.
4162799	4165461	And I said, you can go look at the Discord what I said.
4165521	4167082	I said something nasty in response to that.
4167102	4168162	You can go look at Discord what I said.
4168202	4170764	If that is true, I said I would do something nasty.
4171164	4171444	All right.
4172045	4173126	But here's the real thing.
4173926	4174626	No, no.
4176527	4184532	I said I would go to Nintendo headquarters and give handjobs in the parking lot.
4184572	4185272	That's what I said.
4186292	4187133	Oh, that's not bad.
4187213	4189594	I think I actually redacted myself, but there you go.
4190194	4196738	Anyway, but here's the thing, is that in that list, it's missing...
4198030	4198731	Indie titles.
4198951	4207956	And I know that Nintendo does indie directs, but that doesn't mean they aren't going to showcase smaller studio things in their summer showcase.
4208437	4219104	And I think every bad leak list out there neglects this, is that they don't just focus on Nintendo and the big third parties.
4219904	4221685	There's always little announcements too.
4222085	4223506	So that's why that list ain't real.
4223686	4226827	But anyway, I would love to see whatever really happens from Nintendo.
4227647	4230569	And if my arm's going to be very tired in Washington, then fine.
4231009	4233450	That's the game I want more than anything.
4233950	4237512	You'd become the most popular podcaster with Nintendo.
4238272	4239112	You mean I'm not already?
4240833	4241313	Alright.
4242114	4242394	Anyway.
4243982	4244743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4261184	4267149	I had to fight with playing Baldur's Gate 3 on GeForce.
4267309	4273054	It had worked great before, and this time, I don't know if it's just the virtual environment, but it's reading.
4273835	4281321	I've always had this problem where it reads my Logitech controller as an Xbox controller when, if anything, it's more like a PlayStation controller.
4282611	4304427	and I have to redo all this stuff on it so I was fighting that but I did play a little bit I also played some Avatar on my own I'm waiting for the season pass that I got with my order to come through definitely played some Dead by Daylight I had a really entertaining night playing Dead by Daylight honestly
4306810	4324015	I've also played a crap ton of pinball because I did go with Dan to a little party with the pinball group and I got to play Labyrinth, which I felt it was a little dark and honestly less fun than I thought it was going to be.
4324255	4324515	Oh, wow.
4326091	4340127	um i mean it wasn't bad don't get me wrong uh and maybe i just needed to play it a little bit more um and also i will admit someone was talking in my ear the whole time i was playing it and i'd like to be able to concentrate on the game um
4341664	4343264	Also, Looney Tunes.
4343304	4344325	The new Looney Tunes table.
4344585	4346085	Which is a lot of fun.
4346285	4348406	It is a blast to play.
4348966	4350927	I absolutely love it.
4351427	4353707	You find one in the wild, you play the hell out of it.
4353747	4354468	It's so good.
4354488	4366491	I also played Total Annihilation, which is one of the... Just a really, really fun table.
4366531	4367531	One of the multi-morphics.
4368651	4369872	And I played Woe Nelly...
4370882	4374543	Big Juicy Melons Big Juicy Melons Big Juicy Melons
4389019	4390980	Oh yeah, she was holding them up.
4391400	4393261	I'll send you a picture of what it looks like.
4393321	4393761	Oh boy.
4395802	4401785	And then I played Tron for a little bit, because the friends had a Tron, and they also had the cutest bulldog ever.
4406007	4410589	And I was playing that stupid RuPaul's Drag Race game.
4412770	4414471	It's so stupid, and I love it.
4416314	4434234	they have the Willow Pill event going on and I myself am going back to watching that season because I haven't seen it through so alright we all have guilty pleasures in gaming, it happens and it's probably on your mobile device alright
4435131	4436352	Well, I need something to do.
4436452	4439776	My brain's sort of like, I have played Pulp Fiction, by the way, Bobby.
4442018	4443459	It's reasonably fun.
4443580	4446302	I didn't really find it super engaging to play.
4448004	4448344	All right.
4448585	4450046	Well, let's go over to Loki.
4450066	4450727	How was your gaming week?
4452345	4454366	My gaming week was all Minecraft.
4454406	4458346	I was working on stuff for my latest episode, which came out today.
4458726	4471829	So I built the entrance to my theme park, and I created artwork for my season pass that I have in the game that you use to get in and out of the theme park.
4472029	4473370	Well, in the theme park.
4473650	4474670	We would use it to get out.
4474690	4475810	That'd be ridiculous.
4477451	4478691	But yeah, it's...
4480066	4483429	It took a long time to get everything done just right.
4483489	4484429	But yeah, it's out now.
4484449	4484990	You can go watch it.
4486451	4486751	All right.
4486871	4487632	Yeah, that's all I did.
4488893	4489553	My gaming week.
4489593	4491935	So I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I usually do.
4492035	4493717	I actually did some streaming this week.
4493757	4498240	It's been the first time in a couple months, but I played some Mr. Pandaria Remix and World of Warcraft.
4498320	4501382	I got my monk tank to max level right now, which is 70.
4502003	4505946	So otherwise been collecting the little collectibles because that's what you're doing in the remix mode.
4505966	4506907	But it's a heck of a lot of fun.
4507387	4509869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4536145	4542832	Um, but then, uh, let's see, uh, addition to that, I've also been playing Diablo 4 because there's a XP boost event going on right now.
4542972	4546456	So I want to make sure I make the most of that and try to get my seasonal character as far as I can.
4546957	4549920	And then, um, I actually played something new this week, or at least new to me.
4550400	4553844	So this is a game that was out, then it wasn't out, and now it's out again.
4554204	4556026	And I have a friend that's really into it.
4556086	4557948	So he's been kind of like, come on, play this game.
4557988	4558549	Come on, come on, come on.
4558869	4560009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4578934	4606526	but like I don't know it didn't feel quite as chaotic as I think Smash Brothers matches sometimes do um also I'm not good at it um so there was only a little bit that I could do and if you don't pay for the characters you can only use like four or five characters so I was playing as Jason from Friday the 13th who was one of the free characters and I enjoyed doing the move where you shove somebody into a sleeping bag and then go pound pound pound pound like pound them in the sleeping bag so that was making me laugh um
4607466	4609129	And that's my review of multiverses.
4611212	4612414	I don't know what else to say.
4615111	4617333	I'm applauding in my mind.
4645691	4646091	That's it.
4646672	4647632	That was my gaming.
4647792	4653133	I was going to mention real quick since you were talking about your gaming week and you talked earlier about Street Fighter 6.
4653493	4655214	It is half off this weekend.
4655394	4657094	Yes, Deft already pointed that out.
4657154	4657654	Thank you.
4657714	4659835	Deft already pointed that out to me.
4659855	4663035	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4663095	4664656	Thanks for the heads up and my
4665436	4666697	Wallet is currently crying.
4666817	4669378	I'm sure that there will be spills any time soon.
4669558	4674060	Blizzard wants me to pay $90 for the expansion of Diablo 4.
4674481	4681224	It's the limited edition version because, or whatever they call it, Super Digital Collector Edition, because it has the kitty pet.
4682725	4684406	If I paid the most expensive.
4684926	4686507	The expansion itself is, I think, $30.
4686647	4688568	It's not quite so bad.
4688628	4691810	But, you know, of course, they want to find a way to...
4693170	4698952	Suck every dollar out of the wallet of the most hardcore fans, of which I'm kind of one of them, so I don't know.
4698992	4703313	But I have held off successfully so far, so we'll see how long I'm able to last.
4704814	4705674	All right, that's it for my game.
4705694	4706835	Something that you can get later?
4706935	4707595	Is it only...
4709573	4710994	I don't know.
4711234	4718759	I like to think I could get it later because I feel like these companies are always willing to sell you digital upgrades.
4719280	4729066	Square Enix is still offering me every time I sign into Mogstation on 14, don't you want to get a digital collectible edition upgrade for Heaven's Word, the expansion that came out 10 years ago?
4729526	4730627	And I'm like, no, I'm good.
4730787	4734089	I don't need the pet and the minion that come with that.
4734109	4735030	I have 500 minions and 200 mounts.
4735050	4735410	I don't need
4738792	4741994	One more for 30 bucks or whatever they want to charge that upgrade.
4742034	4742654	So I don't know.
4743175	4747277	So Square's going, hey, hey, kids, hey, kids, you want to buy some NFTs?
4747777	4748838	You'll buy some NFTs?
4749658	4751059	No, luckily they aren't NFTs.
4751199	4752880	Not not not this time anyway.
4753320	4754401	That didn't work out for him.
4756181	4759063	Hey, actually, Loki, you bring up a good point.
4759463	4762246	Something to celebrate from all these games we've heard about.
4762306	4765569	Something to celebrate from all these big titles and indie titles.
4765989	4771614	We didn't hear a goddamn thing about NFTs during the biggest week in game announcement.
4771674	4772735	Let's celebrate that.
4772795	4775958	Let's take a moment to just pat ourselves on the back.
4775998	4777159	Congratulations, everyone.
4777439	4779301	We killed NFTs in the gaming industry.
4783204	4785567	Alright, let's get into some gaming.
4785667	4791173	I mean, there's always going to be NFT bullshit and dark quarters of the internet, but if you're still on Twitter, then that's on you.
4791293	4793496	Alright, let's move on.
4793716	4796179	Loki, let's talk about some other gaming news.
4796339	4797340	Other things that happened this week.
4798348	4812442	Yes, so there's been, you know, obviously with all the different game showcases, it is not to be forgotten about all of the game studio layoffs that we've had already within the last few months.
4812542	4815265	I mean, it's just like never ending, it seems like.
4815805	4831775	So along with that, in LA, downtown LA, right next to where some of these are being shown, we have electronic billboards talking about the different studios that have been, they're gone but not forgotten.
4831855	4835678	So they mention Arcane Austin, Roll7, Tango Gameworks.
4836178	4847044	Volition, I believe it's Sony London Studios, and it says everyone laid off, downsized, or made redundant.
4847184	4851806	Thank you for your great games, your friends at New Blood.
4853727	4856769	So I assume it's another indie studio.
4857129	4859350	We love you, we miss you, we hate money.
4860390	4860951	You know what?
4861940	4863381	Good on them for saying something.
4863461	4873084	Good on them for putting that front and center and reminding how we got to these announcements was unfortunately a lot of these closures.
4874985	4876225	I think that's very interesting.
4879146	4880587	And look, everybody's talking about it now.
4880647	4881587	So money well spent, right?
4881607	4882908	Yeah, exactly.
4883906	4889532	And according to the New Blood Interactive CEO, he's like, I'm always trying to find new and creative ways to waste money.
4891294	4892595	I don't know if that was a waste of money.
4892815	4896959	I mean, maybe he could have created a job out of that, but fine.
4897560	4899362	Probably not, not for a billboard.
4899642	4901344	Yeah, billboards aren't quite that much, but still.
4901624	4921330	along with that of course Jeff Keighley also did happen to mention a little bit of it during the whole presentation for some games fest stating that I know if you watch this show you don't just play games you deeply care about this art form and the health of the industry the good news is we have a lot of amazing games to show you from creators around the world over the next two hours
4921790	4928633	Let's face it, this has been a difficult, tumultuous year with company layoffs and studio closures that disappointed all of us.
4929093	4934815	I get inspired by new ideas, the new teams, and the smaller creators.
4935315	4936676	I can and will break through.
4936756	4940317	It's a reminder that big companies, they have to treat their developers right.
4940717	4943218	But because today there are money paths...
4944759	4949702	Money Paths to Sustainability and Success and that's, I think he meant many paths.
4949782	4951643	I think it's misquoted there.
4953513	4954554	I don't think it's money paths.
4955394	4959236	The success in what makes this industry so, so great.
4960357	4974645	Also, he said some souls of creators were invited to the showcase their games because we think this platform is an important way to show new things that you may not even know about, which in the case of like that Koala game I was telling you about, that's developed by one person.
4974785	4977047	So, yeah.
4977607	4979148	So he actually said that at the show?
4980501	4981462	Oh, is that internet?
4981542	4982243	Okay.
4982283	4983163	Again, I didn't watch it.
4983524	4987747	I think the rest was like interviews with... Oh, maybe he did.
4987787	4988067	I don't know.
4988187	4992411	I think I missed part of that in the very, very beginning of the show, but...
4994400	5023635	yeah Bobby's saying he opened with it on stage and sort of reminding us also Jeff's basically saying laid off start your own indie studio not every person can do that they need job stability yeah you know in a perfect world that would be the answer is that you know and I know I've said that on this show too but I always try to kind of put the footnote of if you can if you're able to you know that would be the best thing that could come from this but not everybody seems like a sign of being out of touch a little bit a little bit yeah so anyway
5026316	5041670	um well I'm glad he said something about it at least and kind of like reminded folks of you know the price of a lot of this uh at least he acknowledged it yeah he probably should have done that six months ago at the game awards but um better late than never I suppose um
5042981	5047905	Also, maybe better late than never, the PlayStation VR 2 coming to PC.
5048045	5056011	Now, we kind of knew that this was happening because a couple weeks ago, PlayStation had originally sort of unveiled that they were plotting this whole thing.
5056051	5059114	But this week, we got a lot more details on this.
5059214	5062416	So the adapter for the PC is coming on August 7th.
5063817	5071160	If you have a PSVR 2, which of course was released for the PlayStation 5, you will now be able to hook this up and play PC games.
5071260	5077762	In fact, it even shows in a screenshot Half-Life Alyx, which of course is a game that's unique to Steam.
5079122	5091687	In an official PlayStation blog post that went up this week, Sony mentioned they built the PSVR 2 from the ground up specifically for PlayStation 5, and that's why some features that are on the PS5 are not going to be on PC.
5092907	5098449	HGR, Headset Feedback, Adaptive Triggers, Eye Tracking, Haptic Feedback
5114373	5115755	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
5133394	5148489	their PlayStation VR 2 they're going to start porting some of that stuff to PC maybe and it would be nice to be able to have the full features on PC since you're going to ignore your PlayStation VR 2 platform I don't know I wouldn't say never say never
5149282	5158970	But you will get 4K resolution, 110 degree field of view, see-through view, finger touch detection, 3D audio, all that stuff will be there.
5159010	5159550	The price, $60, $59.99.
5160131	5160991	Fine, I call that $60.
5164694	5192229	and you will have to have a DisplayPort 1.4 cable to use the headset on PC that cable is not included also if you want to know the minimum specs that was all released as well so you will know if this is something that you can work with or not I will say as somebody who only has the PlayStation VR original headset this does make the PSVR 2 headset a little more attractive knowing that it would work not just for the PlayStation games but for
5193410	5212662	You know, Steam, VR games as well I'm not sure I'm ready to take the plunge still But I'll say I'm a lot more there than I was before Like now, maybe we'll put it this way It's kind of like a wish list item now I don't think I'll actually spend the money on it But it's like a wish list Like if one fell in my lap, I wouldn't be upset
5213442	5237980	I would say, well, I mean, if you already have one, if you already have a PlayStation VR 2, I'd say it's a pretty good investment, but I would have to say, like, if I'm going to invest in, like, say, buying a PlayStation VR 2 to use on PC, I would want to see how that compares, like, with other headsets that are out there right now, like, what the, you know, performance is going to be, and with all of the absence of, like, HDR and stuff.
5238140	5238461	HDR's
5239249	5245957	I don't think that's a huge deal, but some of the other stuff, like the adaptive triggers and that type of thing, kind of is annoying.
5246437	5251804	Especially when you consider that they have that built into the controllers themselves.
5252304	5257931	It's just an API that they need to have available for people that want to use it.
5259537	5259777	DarkSakura
5289472	5292833	So Sega has let us down.
5293834	5305818	I wouldn't say easy, just let us down completely by saying that there are going to be no other Sega Mini anything released this year.
5308699	5315246	Basically, and this is a translated quote, I think you'll forget a lot of things after two years.
5315646	5319130	So if you watch this program again after a long time, I think you'll enjoy it again.
5320111	5326877	Just saying, you know, again, there's no, I don't get what that has to do with there not being any, but he wants fans to rewatch the 2022 announcement.
5328479	5331422	It's like, uh, no.
5332082	5338488	It is the fourth anniversary of the Game Gear Micro's reveal.
5338909	5341551	64th birthday of Sega as a company.
5343593	5348858	And they did have a poll to see what many hardware people want next, and Saturn came out on top.
5349198	5349378	So...
5351139	5356562	But the Saturn would be really hard to minimize.
5357962	5361143	And if the Saturn is that hard, I would of course think the Dreamcast.
5361564	5366666	I mean, then again, the Dreamcast runs basically in a Windows-compatible environment, so who knows.
5369387	5377050	However, in another story that popped up, there is a fan-made Saturn Mini version
5378664	5385569	that someone has made and is trying to reach out to see if it's possible to market that.
5386630	5387110	Interesting.
5387590	5390833	Probably be a lot of rights things with that, but yeah.
5392074	5394716	Well, I mean, it's not like they're saying never.
5394836	5397658	I feel like there's a whole, so you're saying there's a chance to this whole thing.
5397678	5398698	It's just not going to happen this year.
5400560	5401060	What was that?
5401120	5404082	You sounded all digitally to me for a moment.
5404382	5406424	It sounds very, so you're saying there's a chance.
5409366	5409667	DarkSakura,
5415649	5416289	Rob's a robot.
5416990	5418451	You know, we've known this since the 80s.
5418791	5421213	It's just a fact that we need to accept nowadays.
5421393	5427577	But the ironic thing is the stream goes out from my place, so I'm the one that's clear to everybody out there unless the stream is hiccuping.
5427637	5432541	But looking at missed frames, it doesn't look like the stream's hiccuping, so it's just some weird internet blip.
5432821	5434782	It's Discord.
5434822	5435463	Blame Discord.
5435623	5435943	All right.
5436303	5436624	Stupid.
5436724	5438605	Well, let's blame other things on the internet.
5439406	5439706	Loki.
5441556	5448221	Alright, well, I mean, another strike against emulation, I guess, and piracy, maybe?
5449543	5454126	So Vimslare, one of the oldest places on the internet to find and download ROMs and emulators.
5454306	5455647	I can't believe that's still running.
5455748	5456908	I recognized that name.
5456969	5459210	I was like, holy shit, that's still a thing.
5459691	5468738	Yeah, apparently they've announced that they had to remove many titles from Sega Nintendo and Sony, the ESA and LEGO.
5471505	5472946	What was the ESA published?
5473286	5473687	Nothing.
5473907	5475608	I don't know why they would mention them, but whatever.
5476648	5482092	So they posted a post on June 5th announcing minigames that are removed following requests from various companies.
5482773	5488296	Vim's Lair has been asked to remove minigames from the vault on behalf of... Hold up.
5488316	5488516	Pause.
5488556	5488957	Pause.
5489017	5489397	Pause.
5489997	5491759	And the ESA is one of those companies.
5493420	5495341	So who do you think... They made a request.
5495361	5496882	Who do you think put this whole thing together?
5498551	5499512	I guess there you go.
5499632	5500852	That's what they've been doing this month.
5501113	5507196	So since there's no E3 anymore, they have the legal time to go shut down these ROM sites.
5507536	5509397	And look, I understand.
5509457	5514120	Say what you will about piracy, although these games are years and years and years old.
5514240	5515380	Sure, okay, fine.
5515420	5516881	You want a virtual console, me?
5517702	5518742	Nintendo Switch Online?
5518842	5519923	Fine, fine, fine.
5520223	5523625	But all it's doing is driving this shit further underground.
5524125	5532307	Now these are all going to be the e-ticket items on Discord servers and other underground places around the internet.
5533667	5534067	It's all it is.
5534127	5545250	It's good that they took care of it now because we know now that emulation and ROMs have thoroughly been destroyed and that it is over now.
5545310	5547791	Piracy is over thanks to the ESA.
5548251	5548511	Clearly...
5549631	5555756	This is happening because the number one, well, I don't know if it's still the number one app on the iOS store, but it was for a hot minute.
5555796	5559019	The number one app on the iOS store was an emulator.
5559459	5564323	That's why this is happening now because what are the games people want to play first off?
5564363	5567226	It's probably one of those games you just mentioned minus the ESA thing.
5568447	5574398	Right, what I'm saying is it's ridiculous to think that this makes any sort of dent in anything.
5574639	5577464	It's just so stupid.
5577865	5579388	Yeah, it's just going to drive it for the runaround.
5579468	5579789	That's all.
5580430	5581130	I mean, sure.
5581330	5582911	They want it harder to smash?
5582931	5584192	There you go.
5584592	5585172	Good job.
5586633	5588254	What do people want to have?
5588874	5590795	The games that they're not supposed to have.
5591255	5603641	So you just made people a checklist of things that they should be going to get because it's very clear that now you're chasing down these things so it's just going to make people want to have a backup of these games on their computer even more.
5605042	5605482	Exactly.
5607901	5612127	but only the ESA would be applying logic from 1995 to this whole situation.
5614090	5621621	I mean, they are celebrating their impact on the industry having not been able to pull off a show for three years now.
5623063	5624285	You guys are awesome.
5625498	5633786	Alright, in the arena of questionable legal things, we know Nintendo has had some leaks in the past.
5633846	5637309	For example, you might remember that the game Yoshi was leaked.
5637409	5643815	I think, although it was actually, it was Yoshi when it was announced and then it became Yoshi's Crafted World.
5644315	5645756	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5663092	5665013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5683243	5685704	Nintendo and why has Nintendo evolved with this?
5685764	5710110	Because apparently in 2017, these documents show that a contractor who had administrative access, who worked with Google, who owns YouTube, of course, used their admin privileges at YouTube to download and watch what was assumably a private or unlisted trailer for a Yoshi game that Nintendo was about to unveil.
5711130	5717695	That contractor shared it with a friend who, of course, immediately took that screenshot to Reddit.
5718355	5725340	This is why all of my friends know that if they ever share private information I give them, they will be killed because that's what friends do.
5726761	5730022	So you need to keep secrets for a bitch.
5730283	5731583	So I don't know why.
5732243	5734844	So obviously the most untrustworthy friend in the world.
5735425	5742107	But anyway, yeah, they were the one that went over to Reddit and then another Google employee saw it and recognized it.
5742147	5752332	It's interesting because if you actually see the screenshot, you can see there's like an admin.youtube thing in the URL complete with most of the key in there that I'm sure made this very easy to trace back.
5753072	5753933	Google's full statement on this.
5767947	5768407	Okay, so anyway.
5795236	5821133	that's how stuff got leaked was because somebody put a private video on YouTube and somebody else watched it and I'm sure that's going to make everybody think twice about the private videos they're putting on YouTube not that anybody's putting porn up there because I'm sure you know automated filtering and stuff looks for that but you know it's very very interesting so if you keep a personal diary or something there's other people out there that could absolutely watch it if they wanted to food for thought
5823464	5825245	Anyway, let's move on to some better news.
5825786	5826346	DarkSakura.
5827947	5840797	Well, um, and going into the concept of this is game preservation, there has been a long lost game that was found and preserved.
5841157	5843839	It is Tarzan for Atari.
5845581	5849524	And it was, you know, thought to be gone forever.
5850184	5852286	But nope, it was, uh,
5853607	5865066	It was supposed to be published by Coleco for the 2600 and then for the ColecoVision in 1984, but it was Tarzan.
5865867	5867310	And it turned out...
5869722	5892743	That, you know, with those release dates that they had announced in 1983 at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show They had been talking about that port and that it just kept moving by and moving by and moving by And it didn't really get a release But a collector named Rob, but not you
5893744	5908683	who goes by AtariSpot managed to find a working copy of the game from a former Coleco employee and worked with another homebrew programmer Thomas Jench and got it dumped and it
5910046	5916491	It is one of those games that used the bank switching to get around the hardware limitation.
5918892	5923496	And so they managed to get the game working and now it's out there.
5925537	5926718	Score one for preservation.
5927999	5934284	Yeah, he actually received two Tarzan boards but only one worked.
5934624	5934724	Hmm.
5937082	5964416	so there you go always fun to unearth things from many many many many many years ago that you know just didn't come out for whatever you know sometimes publishing reason or you know with the crash and everything that was happening in the industry at the time yeah very cool I'm looking at the game in play and like it has some pretty in-depth stuff for it and some neat animations and everything so not bad I'd be curious to check it out
5966172	5974495	All right, well, going from the classic industry to the modern industry, Loki, you were very strongly hinting at some of this earlier in the show in a story that's making the rounds this week.
5975956	5985299	Yeah, so Suicide Squad, there was a report with Bloomberg talking about what happened?
5985479	5987140	Like, why this bomb?
5987660	5989421	And I know it's going to come as a shock.
5990626	5998452	Well, what had happened was... What happened was, apparently, they said there wasn't a single cause of Suicide Squad's failure.
5998892	6015944	Instead, Rocksteady Studios' project was hurt by an unclear and shifting creative vision, ill-fated pivot to a completely new genre, and the perfectionism of the former creative director Sefton Hill, who left the team prior to release to head up a brand new studio.
6016724	6016824	Um...
6017725	6027670	So apparently Sefton Hill created a bottleneck during the development process with people waiting a week or longer for him to sign off on individual elements of the shooter.
6027870	6042477	At one point, he apparently had the idea to introduce an in-depth vehicle customization aspect to the game, balked at others on the team since it would seem to undermine Suicide Squad's emphasis on its anti-heroes' individual traversal abilities.
6044283	6048539	and they said that of course it has very bad vehicle missions in it which is kind of
6049577	6072911	maybe part of what he did also he scrapped big chunks of the script and struggled to convey his evolving ideas um they said according to the article confessed that he had spent much of his time playing games like Destiny and um you know these setbacks were compounded by the increasing tech debt due to short-term fixes for projects some hope would shift early 2020 um
6074652	6076754	Why didn't they stop the game from releasing?
6076874	6077634	Well, Warner Bros.
6077674	6080056	executives apparently didn't see anything wrong with this.
6080456	6081537	They didn't seem concerned at all.
6081597	6086661	They kept reviewing the demonstrations of the game and sending laudatory feedback, praising the graphics.
6088342	6092765	Because that's the only thing a fucking boardroom person knows how to review is the graphics.
6092905	6093666	Oh, looks good.
6093706	6094146	Exactly.
6094166	6094787	Looks cute.
6094827	6098289	Saying they expected Suicide Squad to become a billion dollar franchise.
6100891	6102132	Because the graphics are really good.
6103274	6107157	Yeah, since then... Somebody show the Warner Brothers board the Flight Simulator trailer.
6107197	6108358	I'd like to know their thoughts.
6110239	6113321	So, since then, they've put out updates.
6114402	6118505	Like, Season 1, for example, was released in two chunks because it was garbage.
6119545	6123228	Both episodes are now available for people to play.
6124108	6128932	They said their developer updates will change from being weekly to releasing them when we have big news.
6129732	6130973	to share about future content.
6131354	6135077	Yeah, what's funny is their content is all recycled content as well.
6135657	6140661	Like all of the stuff from season one, like all the boss fights that are in there are recycled boss fights from the game.
6142362	6142883	So it's like...
6145729	6147250	I'm glad... I don't get it.
6147330	6151713	Look, it's very... When you said, why did Suicide Squad bomb?
6152334	6155436	I'm like, the easy answer for this is executive mismanagement.
6155976	6163622	I'm glad this article goes so far as to name who in the executive team was at fault and why.
6164442	6170326	I still think it feels a little bit like setting one person up to take the fall because the reality is...
6171167	6172428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6187765	6192369	This person, sure, is setting up to take the fall and was doing a very crappy job at their job.
6192449	6196232	Sure, I'm not going to say, but who's watching the Watchmen?
6196832	6197833	That type of thing.
6197873	6201536	Who's making sure that that guy's doing what he's supposed to be doing?
6201636	6204198	And that this shouldn't come out late.
6204238	6206500	Yeah, S200 Matt says, just blame Zaslav.
6206660	6206980	Done.
6207521	6208021	It's his fault.
6208081	6213085	Well, and also it sounds like the executives don't understand what a game is supposed to be.
6213245	6215087	So the executives literally don't know what the fuck they're doing.
6216658	6221763	It's like, it's like, it's like if you just shot fireworks in their face.
6222143	6224065	I mean, that's essentially what the game looks like anyways.
6224205	6229030	It's like shooting fireworks in their face and they're like, oh, it's so amazing.
6229590	6234815	Like, and that's the thing too, is like you look at this game and it's not really amazing graphically.
6234835	6237378	I mean, like there are like the cut scenes are pretty good.
6237418	6242142	The motion capture is good on it, but the gameplay is trash and like the game is trash.
6242142	6246426	Well, it just goes to show the biggest problem in the gaming industry right now is a boardroom.
6246866	6248068	That is the biggest problem.
6248088	6249689	It was why do we keep talking about?
6250170	6251511	Why is the answer?
6251891	6253793	We'll go start your own indie studio.
6253853	6257416	You're not going to have these types of problems because what's missing in an indie studio?
6257977	6258517	A boardroom.
6259358	6273054	There's not somebody that's motivated purely by the money and the dollar signs and the trends they see on Wall Street and what they're reading about on the internet and what they're hearing about at conferences and stuff like this.
6274555	6277519	It's these people that are making the decisions that fuck everything up.
6279892	6282834	The biggest problem in the gaming industry right now is the boardroom.
6284115	6288278	But you can see the Day of Reckoning is very fastly approaching.
6288298	6289879	And unfortunately, it's not.
6289919	6291500	And this is the most frustrating thing about it.
6291560	6293481	It's not the boardroom that's paying the price.
6294702	6297104	Now, that guy left, so fine.
6297444	6298144	You know, he left.
6298445	6305329	But all of those people, all of that board that saw that game and signed off on it should be held accountable.
6305349	6307151	Period.
6307191	6307571	Period.
6308986	6319059	I better know which game he's working on over at Microsoft there because... Yeah, and even Microsoft, probably with this report coming out, is kind of looking a little closely, right?
6319460	6320701	Looking a little more closely.
6320761	6321843	Oh, I saw what you did.
6322223	6324846	And Microsoft absolutely should be doing that.
6325506	6353926	you know if if you know and there could be other factors coming into play that I don't even really want to get into but like it could be something about the environment something about you know like maybe maybe Warner Brothers wasn't clicking for him in a way yeah and Microsoft is and I think that's the benefit of the doubt that should be given but you know Microsoft's going to be watching well and also they give him a little bit more benefit aside from like the procedural stuff where he's taking forever to get sign off on certain things
6354895	6356285	Like, we don't know
6357443	6360725	Like, people don't intend to do their job poorly on purpose.
6360965	6375155	It's just, there could be other factors, like some of these executives could be pushing, hey, we need to make this a live, you know, we need to push towards this live service type thing, and so that's why he was saying, oh, we need to go in this direction to make this game.
6375775	6376756	Although, we don't know that.
6378197	6380478	Maybe he thought that that was just what was best for it.
6381199	6387323	So, I think we need to know the whole picture, but also at the same time, like, I don't care anymore because this game's trash, and I don't,
6388504	6390204	I just like watching the fire right now.
6390224	6393206	I don't know, it sucks.
6393246	6395147	There's real people behind it developing it.
6395667	6398828	It sucks that it's what it is, but also the quality control.
6398948	6404351	I mean, it's just not something I'd be proud of putting out.
6406852	6411574	Well, I don't know if maybe Warner Brothers is a little more proud of Multiverses.
6411934	6415655	I don't know how it's performing on its kind of re-release that it's going through right now.
6416195	6424078	But a story came out that really makes it look not great because there is a feature that lets you pay money
6424478	6432061	to refill your lives during campaign missions, which sounds very mobile gamey, like, you know, a limited time of day or whatever.
6432962	6436663	And of course, fans kind of spoke up about it and said, this is stupid.
6437483	6442926	Player First Games came out and said that the feature was a bug and not intended as part of the game.
6443446	6444746	So they said it was a bug.
6445307	6452810	So actually coding this whole thing for sale in the store, having the graphics and the text to go with it, that's a bug?
6453650	6457671	I think that maybe the fact that it was accessible was a bug.
6458771	6459452	Interesting.
6459812	6465433	So that maybe the store was set up for somebody else, like a tester or something, to go in and get it for free?
6466294	6476236	Well, it might have been set up as an intentional thing that they wanted to come out with the game and decided that it wouldn't fly and then patched it out, but bug.
6477137	6477737	It's accessible.
6477757	6478137	Interesting.
6478672	6481140	That's happened with features of games that were unintended.
6481220	6483326	I mean like... I mean...
6484648	6485729	That's what glitches are for.
6485849	6487931	I mean, I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt for this.
6488731	6494696	But I mean, there are tons of things that are fully programmed into a game and are inaccessible, Hot Coffee.
6497018	6506345	Or even with what I'm playing on my retro night on Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you can glitch the little trap door right at the beginning of the castle to open and there's a whole section down there.
6506785	6508567	It's not complete, but it's there.
6508907	6509608	Leads to a save room.
6510407	6512709	Yeah, but like, I don't know.
6512889	6520095	When you use the word bug with those situations, this situation is kind of like, well, but you were going to go down that road.
6520115	6521176	So it's not really a bug.
6521256	6525920	That's a bad idea that we accidentally left in the game.
6526500	6529423	That's why I said the accessibility of it is the bug.
6529643	6530503	Yeah.
6530523	6537950	We pushed an unintentional update for features, just like how Assassin's Creed or whatever it was, like showing ads in a menu.
6539890	6565258	it's not a bug it's just that you push the feature out that you didn't intend to actually push out like you create the feature and then it didn't pass that final check of like oh god we shouldn't do this that's too much but someone asked for the feature to be made it's just that the sign off you know when they saw it or when they got to that point they re-evaluated I guess for now
6567196	6568397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6602549	6609812	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6610293	6612914	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6613654	6615735	Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick this week?
6616876	6623319	I picked Street Fighter 3 New Generation as in the first of the Street Fighter 3 games.
6625199	6630442	It is, of course, a fighting game in the Street Fighter series and it was...
6631514	6636701	Really, really, really... It taught us that Capcom can count to three.
6638163	6641608	Because before Valve started doing it, Capcom was doing it.
6643047	6647853	All the bajillion versions of Street Fighter 2 that existed.
6648553	6652718	So at any rate, this was originally released in the arcades in 1997.
6655121	6661649	And the official name on the cabinet is 3, A New Generation of Street Fighters.
6662991	6677442	It was produced for this CP System 3 hardware, which was CD-ROM based and allowed for a lot more elaborate graphics than the CPS2 that Street Fighter Alpha and the earlier ones were on.
6679483	6687069	And it's considered to be a direct sequel to Street Fighter 2 and basically only retained Ken and Yu.
6688190	6716849	and a whole new roster of fighters and a new boss even so we'll get into that in a sec it did have two updates there was Street Fighter 3 Second Impact also in 97 and Street Fighter 3 Third Strike in 1999 which honestly I'm going to say that Third Strike really was the best improvement there was a home version of the game that was released on Dreamcast
6718049	6724233	in a 2-in-1 that was Street Fighter 3 Double Impact, which also included Second Impact.
6725353	6730836	And then, of course, we finally got the sequel to all of those, so is Street Fighter 4 in 2008.
6731796	6734078	So, moving forward, I mean, it is...
6735418	6738621	It's a fighting game like every Capcom fighting game.
6739301	6748867	However, this introduced a parry system, which I will point out, Samurai Shodown 2 had a parry system before this.
6749628	6756713	But with this, you can basically deflect an attack without receiving damage, but you really have to be precise.
6757133	6764158	I mean, we all remember, was it at EVO that there was the block of every one of Chun-Li's kicks or something?
6765238	6768242	That was pretty impressive.
6768983	6781838	But a really good player can use that to also reduce any damage by special moves in super arts by doing a parry.
6782618	6785121	But again, you have to be really precise about it.
6786483	6794753	The other thing that you get is the Super Arts, which are a powerful special move, like a Super Combo, a Street Fighter Turbo, and Alpha.
6796875	6802322	You will be able to select from one of three character-specific Super Arts to use.
6804263	6808705	and you have a super art gauge that fills up with you doing different moves against people.
6809265	6826830	And once you can do that, you can do it when the gauge is filled and depending on what you choose, the length of the super art gauge can vary as well as the amount that you can stock up in that gauge.
6828228	6853328	that gauge so you can also cancel a special move into a super art taking that from Street Fighter EX it had far more elaborate sprites including multiple stun sprites a turned around state in which when your character is turned around your back faces the opponent after being hit um
6854489	6857652	So it's just all kinds of stuff that went into this.
6860235	6874751	Just to skip a little bit up, apparently each character is made up between approximately 700 and 1200 individually drawn frames of animation running at 60 frames per second.
6875552	6880194	That's why the game for me was just always like, it's so fluid.
6880835	6881955	Like, look at the movement.
6882916	6884016	It was new, you know?
6885497	6888238	So going back to the characters, of course we have Ryu.
6888739	6890339	He wants the fight.
6890800	6892320	There's Ken, who...
6893721	6894682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6914431	6923423	We have Dudley, who is a gentleman British boxer, and he's trying to win his Jaguar back from Gil.
6924305	6927789	I mean, and I have to say it like it said over there, the Jaguar.
6929608	6931409	It was his father's antique convertible.
6931989	6939293	You have Elena, who I played a lot of, who fights with capoeira, as in all legs and feet.
6941093	6946616	Ibuki, who is the other one I like to play, who is a ninja girl.
6946836	6950117	You have Necro, who was a...
6951838	6954181	A Russian guy who was experimented on.
6955283	6960550	Oro, who is a hermit who fights with one arm tied behind his back so he doesn't kill his opponents.
6961789	6966431	You have Sean, who is Japanese-Brazilian, and he's like Ken Sakura.
6969353	6972374	Yoon and Young, the Kung Fu twins.
6974415	6978957	And they are basically head swaps with the same moves and everything.
6979057	6983139	But in Second Impact, they got different movesets.
6983580	6984500	So that was cool.
6984800	6988242	And then Gil, the guy who runs around in...
6989807	6998297	A white, I don't know if it's supposed to be a hundoshi or just like speedos or something, but yeah.
6998837	7000459	And he can manipulate fire and ice.
7001400	7003483	The one side is blue, the other side is red.
7004972	7012695	Now, it was announced the game was in development during a March 27, 1996 meeting.
7013716	7015877	They said the development took more than two years.
7016057	7024921	It was first unveiled in 86 at the Japan Machine and Marketing Association tour, and a few minutes of footage were shown.
7027802	7039552	It was also stated before the show, Mikami, as in Mikami Shinji, stated that it would be possible to convert it to home consoles that were then on the market.
7040633	7049681	And including the, at the time, upcoming Panasonic M2, which it's one I haven't gotten into a lot on, but it was supposed to be the successor to the 3DO.
7052862	7064200	IGN witnessed a demo of the game in development for Nintendo 64 and Nintendo 64DD and IGN thought that it might be coming out on that um
7065402	7084275	it was a rumor, that's what Capcom said and Nintendo actually did delay the launch of the 64DD until December 1999 so Capcom said it might be possible to port Street Fighter 3 to the Sega Saturn if they use the RAM expansion cartridge
7085977	7096926	However, though, because of this game running on the CBS3 engine and all the stuff that went into it, the only home release that they did was on Dreamcast.
7099332	7099992	and so on and so forth.
7122108	7125711	and a parry attack mode in Second Impact.
7127072	7127753	That was in there.
7127773	7128874	You had a bonus round for that.
7129154	7135359	And it let you play as Gil and Shin Akuma or Golki in Second Impact.
7136240	7141464	And they were the purely, you know, as in the arcade version, purely computer controlled.
7142265	7146808	The soundtrack was released by First Smile Entertainment on CD.
7146948	7150190	And the Third Strike soundtrack was released by Mars Colony.
7150710	7152391	And it had an arranged soundtrack.
7153492	7156014	Okay, let's stop and talk about the soundtrack for Third Strike.
7156694	7158435	I thought that it was really good.
7158515	7161777	The announcer tracks were done by a Canadian rapper called Infinite.
7162878	7163018	And...
7164799	7169482	The music in the game was just this interesting fusion.
7169522	7172584	You had some drum and bass, you had a little bit of jazz, some hip-hop.
7173945	7176186	I really liked Ibuki's music.
7176346	7180969	Ibuki's music to me just sounds like fusion jazz all over and I'm into it.
7182330	7190655	It was re-released in 2018 as part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection for PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.
7192080	7193841	It got decent ratings.
7194181	7196823	Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version 31 out of 40.
7197943	7204207	And overall, the arcade version, of course, did get a lot better reports.
7204347	7204507	But
7206152	7210876	Some people just were not completely into Street Fighter 3.
7210916	7212157	There was a lot of people who were.
7213158	7214979	It was really divisive.
7215880	7219102	I did not enjoy playing it when it first came out.
7219182	7221104	I really, really didn't care for it.
7222365	7223146	I liked Ibuki.
7223186	7223906	I liked Elena.
7225167	7227069	Of course, I played Ryu often.
7228470	7234255	But for me, it wasn't really there until Third Strike came out.
7235075	7262662	and who knows maybe Second Impact and Third Strike will be their own classic game at some point but at any rate that's the game Street Fighter 3 New Generation yeah I um this you know for as much Street Fighter 2 as I played this one didn't really land with me at first and I think there's something to be said about how they kind of basically changed up the entire roster uh you know save Ken and Ryu from the very first game and all that I think it was you know kind of harder to just
7263912	7266113	I guess maybe get into these new characters at first.
7266273	7266633	I don't know.
7266733	7272475	But there's a lot that this game obviously kind of did for fighting games in general.
7272515	7276456	Like the smoothness you talked about especially is so noticeable with this, right?
7277116	7279277	In the arcade mode and just how smooth it runs.
7279417	7280297	It looks so good.
7281537	7282558	Really something different.
7282918	7285799	I remember we got one in the arcade that I worked at.
7285819	7286919	Yeah.
7288382	7307475	and I just remember just watching the demo mode for a little bit and then watching people play it and I was like oh my god it's so pretty and all of it being hand drawn animation you know we don't have I mean now when a game does hand drawn animation it's a novelty yeah
7310949	7316992	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says aren't Street Fighter games like Star Trek movies only the even numbers are good?
7317813	7319013	Nah, Third Strike was great.
7319353	7324556	But yeah, I was gonna say, you know, even the third Star Trek movie has its fans.
7325597	7329579	I'll tell you what was funky to me is that when Chun-Li
7330419	7332180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7347406	7354069	Yeah, and OrangeRite kind of points out like it was okay for the time and then Third Strike was well beloved and Five, Street Fighter V got better.
7354189	7360431	So it's like maybe the odd ones kind of get better with age, although the original is kind of just an anomaly in a way.
7360531	7362512	Like we don't talk about the first Street Fighter game really.
7363152	7365993	I still like Street Fighter 4 better than 3 and 5.
7366653	7367974	Oh yeah, 4 is great.
7368434	7376697	You see, so Chun-Li essentially, all those people that skip leg day, she makes up for their skipped leg days by taking extra leg day.
7377137	7378618	She absorbed their leg day.
7378858	7380038	She absorbed all their leg days.
7380058	7384320	And everyone was left with very spindly, yet still somehow muscular thighs.
7384840	7387441	And Chun-Li's like, look at all of this.
7389513	7391854	She put all of her stat points into thighs.
7392514	7393814	Yep, that's it.
7394155	7396255	Your classic game of the week, Street Fighter 3.
7397175	7404238	She has a 10 in Charisma, a 15 in Dexterity, and a 57 in thigh.
7405438	7411140	Alright, let's cover some other headlines real quick in a segment called Rapid Fire News.
7411280	7411500	Loki.
7412915	7420300	Yep, so there's some fun mods out there for games that you probably shouldn't be playing on your PC, but you can.
7421160	7437111	So there's been a team of fans have been working to port the Jak games to PC, and now they've added a mod that you'll be able to use on this ported version to play multiplayer in Jak and Daxter.
7438260	7440845	So that's cool, because you can't do that.
7442327	7451284	So now they have this mod called Team Runs, and it's Jak and Daxter Online, I guess.
7452802	7477494	and yeah you can play a full co-op uh through the campaign and I they even have in-game timers splits automatic lead boards submissions for like different speed running tools including with that um I don't know how many players total they can do but they had a lot of players in one of the screenshots there's at least four players I saw during their like kind of trailer showcasing this um
7478595	7479115	That's cool.
7479536	7482777	Hope it doesn't get really fast.
7483478	7491462	You know, I hear that game industry, you know, what was it?
7492963	7493423	Oh, gosh.
7494244	7495484	See, I've already forgotten about them.
7495664	7496265	The ESA.
7496485	7501528	I hear that ESA's out there and they're hungry for some article points?
7501888	7505390	I don't know.
7505470	7506490	They're seeking relevancy.
7508660	7516075	Apparently there's a mysterious banana clicking game on Steam that really has no point aside from clicking a banana and the number goes up.
7516616	7518340	Well, I wouldn't say it doesn't have a point.
7518360	7520103	Well, wasn't that the plot of Cookie Clicker?
7521688	7525632	Sort of, but Cookie Creator had some actual progression in it.
7525732	7528754	Like, you can unlock the grandmas, and there's the whole weird elders thing.
7528774	7531457	Yeah, the whole demon circle grandma, yeah.
7531517	7538123	Whereas this is just, you click a banana, and apparently it does unlock different achievements as well.
7539063	7546870	I do think, though, one of the things that maybe are keeping people doing it is it also unlocks bananas that you can sell on the marketplace.
7547391	7547531	Yeah.
7547811	7557778	so maybe that's what it is that people are selling the bananas and making money I don't know but why?
7561161	7566265	cuz cuz it's a banana and there's 100,000 people playing it 137,817 why?
7566565	7574591	because we love bananas I like a good banana but I don't want to cook a banana all day
7576670	7590298	I would eat a banana all day though We don't need to know about what you do in private, Rob You and your banana eating, I swear Nasty, nasty Bananas are good food Alright, what do you have?
7590638	7591719	What did you think I was talking about?
7591739	7593260	I was talking about bananas Sure you were.
7593300	7597643	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us in gaming?
7598323	7604207	Volgar The Viking 2 has been announced for Switch I've never played Volgar The Viking 1
7605737	7615081	It is a sequel to a side-scrolling platformer that has new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a new soundtrack.
7615161	7617983	And it's going to be available August 6, 2024.
7621204	7625726	You have to be very precise when you're playing the game.
7627267	7632389	And it's very just like classic difficulty.
7634070	7634210	And
7636801	7638282	He's old, apparently.
7638963	7640344	They keep talking about him being old.
7641885	7652414	So you have to use magical power-ups and you have different bosses and it says that they are so big and ugly they're just begging to have their heads chopped off.
7654676	7659879	and orchestral soundtrack speed running tools including an on-screen timer and no HUD mode.
7660800	7663962	You have six different endings depending on how you play.
7665583	7669126	You have a practical mode and multiple profile save options.
7669686	7672348	You have buckets of blood and bone explosions.
7672868	7678192	And the last key feature on the list, Rob, Loki, loincloths.
7679233	7680494	Oh, well, you have my attention.
7681181	7683663	Nothing says awesome game like a loincloth.
7684163	7688226	Yes, I love to store my bananas in a loincloth before I eat them for lunch.
7690747	7692489	That's an interesting place to store a banana.
7693509	7693829	Isn't it?
7694110	7696411	I think bananas just need to be left in the sun to ripen.
7699753	7700454	Maybe in Europe.
7701895	7705137	I don't think that's allowed.
7705217	7707558	I'm talking about bananas.
7707578	7709640	I have no idea what you're talking about.
7710100	7716466	All right, well, what I'm talking about is a great thing for the industry, another labor agreement, another union, if you will.
7717006	7724853	Microsoft and the CWA, the Communication Workers of America, they have reached a labor neutrality agreement for ZeniMax workers.
7724933	7732240	This is similar to the 2022 deal that covered Activision Blizzard employees, and that went into effect in April of this year.
7733221	7735383	A senior quality assurance tester said,
7735763	7746067	said in a CWA press release, their name is Paige Branson, said, thousands of our ZeniMax coworkers now have a free and fair path to organize together for better working conditions.
7747808	7753210	Also, the CWA mentions that Microsoft will take a neutral approach when employees express interest in joining the union.
7753630	7762954	The workers can communicate with their peers and union reps about membership, and that can be done in, quote, a way that encourages information sharing and avoids business disruptions.
7763494	7765115	So, neat.
7766414	7767034	GameTrailersTheShow Yes Yes

7889319	7892941	So if you have ever wanted to drive a forklift, well, maybe you could pick up the U.S.
7892961	7895723	version of this game because I know that something exists here as well.
7895763	7899185	But Japan gets a PlayStation 5 version gold edition this week.
7899705	7900685	How about Europe, DarkSakura?
7903987	7904768	Oops, how about it?

7946431	7953715	Yep, so there is a big campaign going on to try to fix or save Team Fortress 2.
7955256	7969323	Essentially, there's a big bot problem in the game, and now over 200,000 fans have basically signed the petition to try to get Valve to actually do something with this.
7970824	7974025	You know, they had that whole, hey, we hear you guys.
7976211	8004766	but that was like we hear you and we're doing nothing about it that was like over a year ago something like that and then of course now Team Fortress 2 has received over 25,000 negative reviews and now has dropped to mostly negative as far as the reviews go for the game so much for Team Fortress 3 yeah I guess but yeah Valve has been silent so far about
8005672	8007453	anything that they're doing.
8007573	8013555	They just need to update their anti-cheat or something so that it's not so easy for these people to run bots.
8014356	8018677	If their anti-cheat, though, is only on its second iteration, they can't upgrade it, you know?
8018957	8020218	That's right.
8020278	8025720	As SJ100Matt says in chat, we hear you, but in order to fix it, we have to type the number three, and we can't do that.
8028541	8028701	Yeah.
8029282	8029742	Precisely.
8029822	8030062	Sorry.
8030603	8038067	Anyway, well, this is one of those, like, I can't believe we're living in the year 2024, but here we are kind of stories.
8038167	8044191	And that is that IKEA is now hiring people, but it's not for what you think.
8044931	8049013	So, you know, the game, I'm going to use a quote of fingers, the game Roblox.
8049134	8052936	I know Loki knows this game because his kids participate in Roblox, right?
8052956	8053436	Yeah.
8053816	8060222	Of course, this is a multi-platform, multiplayer game, and you use tools to create, play, and share games and experiences.
8060302	8064525	It's kind of like what happens when ZZT becomes dystopian and three-dimensional.
8065386	8067728	Would that be an accurate description of Roblox?
8069020	8071342	I'm sort of.
8072042	8079307	It's like if Second Life was more Duplo, I guess, or something like that.
8079367	8079748	I don't know.
8079768	8087653	Well, now maybe Second Life can pay you a little bit because Ikea is going into Roblox and they are making a digital store.
8088134	8091416	This store will be staffed by real humans.
8092036	8097841	You know, a lot of people are kind of dunking on this, but there's also part of me that's like,
8098741	8126523	at least it's not AI like I kind of feel like we should sort of celebrate that they didn't just put AI bots in there to do that which honestly is kind of you know what you'd see most they're going to probably have to at some point because like think about it okay like this isn't gonna last so now now they've essentially told the universe and I mean the universe hey guys we we're gonna be hiring some people today we're gonna run into this they're gonna pay you to do this but
8127981	8137887	these are real people you can interact with please don't troll them you are going to get so many people just
8138823	8141404	Can you imagine doing your job?
8141484	8142944	Even if it's a remote job.
8164423	8164903	All day long.
8165303	8166323	Like, can you imagine that?
8166503	8169244	That sounds like a thrilling good time.
8169444	8170784	Well, anyway, here's the deal.
8170984	8176185	So IKEA is hiring 10 lucky candidates to work in the digital Roblox store.
8176245	8177045	You will get paid.
8177525	8182286	You get what equates to $16.82 is an hourly rate.
8183206	8186567	And of course, it's a remote job because, yeah, it's in a video game.
8187287	8191848	You have to be 18 or older and you must live in the UK because that's where these jobs are based.
8192288	8192328	Um...
8223115	8225696	I want to eat meatballs in front of customers.
8226917	8227897	Not serve them.
8228377	8236841	If you're thinking about applying, here are some very serious questions that they ask you on the application that you must submit.
8237461	8239862	How do you feel about being turned into pixels?
8240962	8245544	If you were pixelated... How did you feel about the Adam Sandler movie, Pixels?
8246525	8247885	Which would you be and why?
8248445	8251967	What would you do if we ran out of pixelated hot dogs in our bistro?
8257549	8259471	Login to Shell and type fdisk.
8263455	8264316	I hear what you did there.
8265638	8268421	That would be if we ran out of big slated hot dogs.
8268941	8271324	I'd burn this store to the ground.
8275889	8276870	Maybe I should apply.
8278723	8280224	Yeah, Rob, apply!
8280244	8282066	Digital goods are not finite.
8282266	8290193	I don't live in the UK, but if I did, I would apply as- Dear friends in the UK, infiltrate Roblox through Ikea.
8290554	8291194	Here's what I'd do.
8291274	8292856	I would apply as a Spice Girl.
8292956	8294237	I would be Meatball Spice.
8295418	8296639	And I would apply for this job.
8296659	8298701	No, Rob, we already know you would be Pumpkin Spice.
8300683	8301604	But not at Ikea.
8301844	8302785	That doesn't work at Ikea.
8302805	8303926	I'd have to be Meatball Spice.
8305700	8306140	I don't know.
8306200	8307220	This sounds awful.
8307660	8308681	It does sound awful.
8308821	8309121	All right.
8310401	8312662	In a moment, we're going to get to the list of roundtable here.
8312802	8322584	But even though it's not a story we have listed on the side, DarkSakura, I know you have some things to say about another thing going on in the industry because it really impacts a game you have given a lot of time and attention to, right?
8323284	8323604	Oh, yeah.
8323644	8324524	Well, both of us have.
8324684	8325264	Yeah.
8325344	8328765	Well, I played it once this week and then remembered why I don't play.
8330912	8339619	Well, Behavior Interactive had laid off up to 95 workers in Montreal, mostly in Montreal.
8340359	8345703	Now, they laid off people earlier in the year as well, but...
8348171	8359454	What was really sus about the whole thing is that this comes after they said that they were going to be more transparent and interactive with the community.
8360134	8369397	Most of the people that they laid off were people who were in social media marketing and fan engagement.
8372415	8390887	and that just seems really suspicious to me and then later on in the day after that happened a lot of the employees came out and said you know that had been interacting with us for you know a few years now they came out and said yeah it's true this happened we can't talk about it you know and
8392168	8392869	and DarkSakura.
8408484	8410745	I managed to find it on the Wayback Machine and saved it.
8412946	8422690	The other thing, too, is that they also just released the Dungeons & Dragons chapter a day early on Monday and did the layoffs on the Tuesday after.
8424691	8434815	So... I... It's just all very... The optics on it are shit.
8435295	8435435	Yeah.
8435796	8445309	I mean, laying off people anyway is bad, but this particular group, in light of other statements that they've said and they're saying that
8448545	8456670	Well, they attributed it to pandemic overspending, but the developers are also saying that there are many, many more reasons.
8458511	8463774	And it's really, a lot of people internally are also pissed about it too.
8464374	8473760	So, they said that they're trying to restructure the way that they do things and blah, blah, corporate speak.
8476101	8499313	and I mean this also comes after you know they acquired Fly Studio in 2023 they got Suck Money Studio and Code Glue and had a new studio in Cornwall and then in 2022 they also acquired Midwinter Entertainment and opened up a Toronto office so I
8502458	8502818	I don't know.
8503779	8506162	The whole thing just leaves me sour.
8506563	8513231	And then there's people who are like, well, I'm not going to buy anything else from them again.
8513971	8518577	And my whole thing is, I don't want to lose anyone else there.
8519899	8520179	You know?
8522185	8549512	and they're bringing I mean it seems to me that I'd have to I mean I don't have access to stockholder reports clearly but I would love to see how much money that they're making on Dead by Daylight or how many people have actually left the game over you know the some of the toxic environment in game although that has ways of reporting that has gotten better and I've seen it acted on from my own reports because I report I report people I'll just say it right now if people are shits I'll report them you know
8552242	8557467	I don't know, it just leaves me feeling really sour about it.
8558548	8561531	Especially since they also have the Frank Stone game coming out.
8562452	8564734	Yeah, Behavior does a lot more than just Dead by Daylight, right?
8564754	8567677	Because they also had the, what was it called, Meet Your Maker or whatever it was called?
8567697	8572241	There's Meet Your Maker, there's Islands of Insight, which I've been playing some because I got the game.
8573422	8575204	There is Project T.
8576445	8577466	I think that's what it's called.
8577966	8579687	They put it open.
8580627	8582789	The beta call was put out there for everybody.
8585190	8589973	And they're working with... Why can't I remember the name of the studio?
8592474	8593835	For doing the casting of Frank Stone.
8594896	8596957	Oh, the ones that made Until Dawn, right?
8596997	8597377	Yeah, yeah.
8597977	8598578	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8598898	8599198	Anyway.
8601039	8602560	So it's just... I don't know.
8603641	8605562	I don't have a word for how it feels.
8606412	8609314	Look, here's the thing to me is this seems very poorly timed.
8609354	8612536	And again, this might just be my own personal perception of everything.
8613056	8619220	It's crappy news, but I'm just saying it's extremely poorly timed with the release of the Vecna chapter.
8619320	8623603	And again, from my perspective, I feel like half of the people that I watch...
8625004	8625404	Thank you, yeah.
8625805	8629708	Half of the people I watch that usually play Dead by Daylight are playing something else this week.
8629888	8645640	And sorry, Jamie, I know you have an aversion to the subject matter of this game, but it has to be said that I see a lot of people that are usually playing Dead by Daylight now playing Killer Clowns from Outer Space, which is from the makers of the Friday the 13th game, who appear to, and I don't know if this is a game, but they appear to have...
8646240	8647920	I refuse There's people who don't know it's a movie
8675608	8676069	Oh, wow.
8676829	8679031	It's funny because I hosted a screening of that movie some time ago.
8679051	8685156	But I feel like what people like about that game is that it is very Friday the 13th.
8685537	8689660	For people that enjoyed that game, there's a lot of that they kind of see in this particular game.
8689760	8691602	So that's kind of interesting to me.
8692002	8695145	But again, the timing, not great for behavior.
8695485	8701350	Because it's like, meanwhile, while you're laying off your relations team for the streaming community...
8701770	8726344	another relations team is very much engaging the streamer community to get them to play their game instead so it's almost like you're saying here take our customers that exactly and we rely I mean the bet the thing that I super loved about behavior were their social content managers it was one of the few things that was uh that had me going back and checking the twat site mm-hmm
8727128	8727408	Yeah.
8727709	8727829	Yeah.
8753782	8754103	All right.
8754583	8760687	Well, we're going to move on and go to the listener roundtable and interact with you all who reach out to us each week.
8761387	8762568	Some of you like to email us.
8762628	8763449	We love to get emails.
8763509	8766351	Participate at OrangeLondrainer.com is the email address.
8767131	8768612	And I believe we got one email.
8768732	8769433	We'd like to get to it.
8770333	8770794	Just one.
8771714	8772515	Hello, LR.
8772655	8780300	On the last episode, you covered Sony's recent state of play and mentioned that Astro Bot was finally getting a starring role in a full-length single-player PlayStation game.
8780740	8782982	But the thing is, that already happened five years ago.
8784286	8786827	I think it said that y'all forgot about Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
8787848	8791090	I'm not going to say I forgot about it because I don't think I ever played it.
8791130	8800995	I was going to say I swore this came up but I'm not going to go back and listen just to see what did I say.
8801015	8805878	But yes, I'm well aware of the Astro Bot game that PS5 launched with and I think they had a VR game as well.
8806799	8809060	Let me keep reading because there's more.
8811641	8823227	Okay, the 2018 exclusive that not only served as one of the very best PlayStation VR games, but also remains one of the best VR games ever made on any platform, sporting a 90 average on Metacritic.
8824047	8826389	It was 100% designed around the technology.
8826849	8832352	Some segments require that you look through the level literally, physically looking through the level.
8832972	8835713	HomeWalls can be broken by bashing them with your head.
8836693	8847136	Despite this, the way the game has you remotely controlling Astro means that the camera works very thoughtfully, resulting in a far smaller chance of motion sickness than in other games.
8847737	8852218	It was a pure joy to play, and if you have a PlayStation VR One headset, trust me when I say...
8852918	8866569	you need to play it it was basically VR Super Mario 64 moment if you really have the stomach for VR I would go so far as to say it's worth considering buying the headset just to play it it's really really really good um I
8868004	8868605	It's a no for me.
8869786	8870387	For obvious reasons.
8870487	8871108	I have played it.
8871208	8871769	It was fine.
8871929	8873912	I don't know if I would say it's the system seller.
8873972	8877417	I think, again, Tetris Effect I think is probably the best VR game.
8877537	8880381	But yeah, it was good.
8880621	8881402	It was, yeah.
8881682	8882944	But I actually feel, and I think
8882944	8884685	I think I kind of agree with what Bobby's saying in chat.
8885145	8885665	I have it.
8885765	8892849	It was fun and really well made, but I don't remember it having the PlayStation fan service that pushed Astro Bot even better, in my humble opinion.
8893229	8896911	Yeah, I mean, you kind of say that it felt like Super Mario 64 in VR.
8897271	8903614	Well, the PlayStation 5 Astro Bot pack-in game, whatever you want to call it, felt like it was Super Mario 64.
8903955	8904335	But like...
8904915	8906518	PlayStation's version of it.
8906538	8908581	I thought it was really adorable.
8908641	8912987	So I'm curious to see what's going to happen when they want to charge people $70 for it.
8913168	8914530	But I think it stands to do alright.
8915723	8922287	The announcement of the new Astro Bot game came for PS5 is bittersweet for folks like me who loved Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
8922927	8925449	That game is stuck on PlayStation VR 1.
8925769	8938296	No PSVR 2 port has been announced, and the new Astro Bot game sequel coming soon doesn't have any VR support at all, which basically confirms that there is zero chance of either a remaster or a sequel.
8938777	8940017	Imagine a Super Mario 64...
8941298	8946942	happened and then after that Nintendo said, nah, 3D Mario was a bad idea and just put out 2D games forever after that.
8947423	8950805	We would have never had Sunshine, Galaxy, 3D Land, 3D World, or Odyssey.
8951345	8952506	Wouldn't that have been a shame?
8952767	8954768	That's what this feels like and it sucks.
8955649	8956009	Anyway...
8959321	8971587	Anyway, I want to end this on a positive note by saying that I'll be showing the almost finished version of Super Duper Multitasking later this month at Too Many Games convention in Oaks, PA from June 28th through June 30th.
8971807	8975109	I'll have a dance pad with me so you can try workout mode.
8975489	8976770	Not kidding, even a little bit.
8977730	8984214	Check near the back corner of the Indie Showcase and look for the big nose glasses wearing bald spotted doofus.
8984414	8984994	That would be me.
8985494	8986835	Hope to see some of you there.
8986975	8987715	Have a great week.
8987996	8988616	ErinYYR
8989290	8995173	I'm so excited for updates to Super Multitasking, and I hope you have a great show and get the game in front of more people.
8996614	8998915	I gotta say, that Mario comparison's a stretch, though.
8998995	9008000	I'm sorry, because I, like, honestly, when you say that, I'm like, if that means they make more 2D Mario games as a result, I'm actually okay with that.
9008080	9010941	And yes, I did like Galaxy a lot, and I liked Odyssey.
9011602	9015504	I don't hold Mario 64 in the same holy text a lot of people do.
9016064	9026346	In fact, I think maybe being a gamer of a certain age where I played the shit out of Mario World, Mario Brothers 3, I was actually kind of annoyed with the 3D transition of Mario.
9028807	9035729	I'm older than you, and Mario 64 had a big shining spot in my heart.
9036429	9036609	Well...
9037605	9062697	Dan and I played that game together and that was the fun thing is that we could take turns on different levels and it would be if it's the same area it would be a different experience I mean that game was really among the pinnacles I think of the Mario series for me and there's a lot of people that feel that way and there's other people that don't and that's gaming opinions
9063297	9080949	so I mean but just but it's the same thing with this game then you know I mean I I have a hard time voicing a negative opinion about something someone loves just because I don't want to you know rub their feathers the wrong way um
9083368	9090151	And I'm glad that when I say YYR that I am very glad that you loved it that much.
9090311	9090931	I really am.
9090971	9093232	I'm glad that it gave you that level of entertainment.
9093652	9098734	Maybe it didn't for everybody else, but I am glad that you have that fondness for it and can still remember it fondly.
9098754	9099474	Yeah.
9099815	9102476	I'm not saying I disliked Astro by any means.
9102636	9103276	It was fine.
9103456	9108638	I just, I don't hold it in quite the high regard, which is fine, that Aaron does.
9109358	9110599	And, uh, yeah.
9110999	9111479	I just don't.
9112080	9113800	But it wasn't a bad game at all.
9113840	9116501	In fact, the PS5 game, I thought was great.
9117022	9118542	And it's a very logical thing.
9118562	9130107	And kind of what I said on last week's show is that, yeah, Sony kind of needs... Now, the comparison to Mario I will make is that Mario is a very family-friendly sort of icon, mascot for Nintendo.
9130668	9138231	And as I was kind of saying on the show last week, especially since Sony is canned media molecule, I don't see LittleBigPlanet and Sackboy being able to kind of carry that.
9138311	9140532	So Astro Bot, I guess, is going to carry that.
9140653	9141198	and I think that's fine.
9145475	9147477	do we have any last minute stories, Loki?
9147497	9147537	um
9175374	9175835	Sort of.
9175995	9180018	I was looking at different games that were part of that PC gaming showcase.
9180138	9181499	Some of that looked really awesome.
9182119	9184161	Like I mentioned that one, Unbeatable.
9184761	9186683	I posted the trailer in Discord.
9187423	9188984	Streets of Rogue is another good one.
9189305	9193087	It looks similar to... Oh gosh.
9193588	9195990	Like the early Grand Theft Auto games, but...
9196963	9198124	Fumes Vigilante 8 Twisted Metal
9222847	9249743	but the art style here is basically low poly low resolution textures and stuff but it's open world and it's like a car combat game with like guns and stuff so that's something that looks pretty awesome another one Airframe Ultra which looks like a cross between Jet Moto and like an arena shooter game so almost like Jet Moto and Twisted Metal which is pretty cool um
9250754	9258486	And then yeah, I did want to mention that Phil Spencer also made comments regarding the layoffs at Microsoft.
9259738	9262140	His comments aren't so great, but understandable.
9262841	9271709	So speaking to IGN's Ryan McCaffrey, he basically said, the closure of any team is obviously hard on the individuals.
9271729	9272709	They're hard on the teams.
9273230	9280296	I haven't been talking publicly about this because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals.
9280756	9285481	It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure that
9286321	9295126	Through Severance and other things that we're doing, I think for the individuals on the team, it's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR, it's about those teams.
9296167	9302111	In the end, I've said it over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow.
9302171	9309155	That means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly aren't the decisions I love, but the decisions that somebody needs to make.
9309972	9312294	We will continue to go forward.
9312334	9321563	We will continue to invest in what we're trying to do with Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did.
9323442	9324182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9347297	9372485	and uh at the start of that answer I was kind of going okay Phil Spencer's basically dancing the same thing he didn't want to do this but he had to but then he kind of takes a little more ownership for it towards the end so I I wonder if he was in the room with the board when this type of thing was made but um I again you know there's a lot of people here to look at that and go well then what what sacrifice are you gonna make Phil Spencer what sacrifice are you making
9376311	9377352	Chirp, chirp, tweet, tweet.
9378132	9378973	Yeah, exactly.
9381234	9381654	Anything else?
9381754	9382255	That's all I had.
9382375	9383035	That's all you got.
9383876	9386317	Well, what a note to end on.
9386417	9390079	But with that, I think we are going to wrap it up and call it a show for the night.
9390119	9394422	We've had a lot, a lot of games that we're talking about here and a lot more to come.
9394562	9396163	I guess some more stuff this week, right?
9396203	9397884	We know Ubisoft's got a thing.
9397904	9399225	Somebody else has a thing tomorrow, right?
9399825	9400566	It's Ubisoft.
9401126	9402427	Forward is tomorrow.
9402447	9402767	Mm-hmm.
9404013	9425622	yay uh no actually I mean no yay that's kind of where I'm at like Assassin's Creed I'm over it they're just not the company for me anymore I don't know I used to be really into you know Far Cry that's before all the Far Cries have literally been like the same yeah I gotcha
9426772	9438038	Alright, well, we will be back in seven days to talk about all of the news that comes up with all the other announcements this week with the, who knows, Nintendo might surprise us, but at the same time, don't hold your breath.
9439238	9440619	But, you know, we can always dream.
9441159	9447923	Anyway, before we wrap up, I want to thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and supporting us because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9448363	9451344	but we need more voices to put out on air so tell a friend or two about the show.
9451384	9452085	Help us spread the word.
9452445	9456627	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify.
9456747	9458307	It all goes a very long way.
9458388	9459368	Thank you so much.
9460508	9461469	Let's get final thoughts.
9461529	9462709	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
9465130	9466511	I don't know how long I'm going to play.
9466551	9470293	I'm not feeling super great but I don't know.
9472074	9472414	I'll play.
9473074	9473434	We'll see.
9473514	9475135	At least the Vecna stuff's fun.
9477064	9503807	I did get the hand of Vecna like right away for me it was just all sorts of nostalgic goodness but I'll be honest there is that part of me that's got a little bit of burnout and I'm really hoping that I can get Baldur's Gate 3 working again so I can make it my Friday game but in the end though I just want to tell everybody go play some pinball for fuck's sake seriously sounds good alright well we'll see you again in a little bit DarkSakura
9506800	9507761	Loki, we'll go to you then.
9507781	9508622	Your final thought tonight.
9509302	9513785	Now that I've finished the entrance to my theme park, do I have to work on the theme park, I guess?
9514826	9525074	Well, it's going to be exciting this week, although we're probably not going to get to do it this week, but the new 121 update for Minecraft comes out on Thursday.
9525774	9532920	So, unfortunately, we have to wait until all the mods update to be able to update the server, but that is a thing that's going to be happening soon.
9533567	9535387	Yay, we get armadillos!
9535967	9544889	Can your theme park have that, uh, something like that video I love of the roller coaster that's not quite finished, so it plays all the sad Adele music while the people are flying off the track?
9544909	9560492	Because I would, I would really... I could do that, but the people to be flying off the track would be me, or whoever's writing it, and so that, that's not exactly fun, um, just to have to clean, have all that stuff cleaned up, but, um... Don't have to clean up a body.
9561881	9564464	It doesn't hurt you is the problem.
9564484	9568748	It's like you just land and you're like, oh, okay, well, you know.
9568868	9570950	Well, they're digital people, Loki.
9570990	9571631	They're not real.
9571931	9572332	None of them.
9572772	9577737	I mean, yeah, I don't care about those fake people, but yeah, we're going to do stuff.
9577757	9579799	Someone was asking, is there going to be Tingle Land?
9580360	9580440	Yeah.
9580780	9582983	No, it's Yeti Park.
9583143	9585586	So to give context, I'll be really quick with this.
9585767	9591394	Yeti is a radio station that was in the first season of Channel 64.
9591834	9595799	Second season, it became a TV studio, a TV station.
9596120	9598182	So now it's like kind of evolving into like a
9598903	9622405	a multimedia company like Disneyland you know sort of but we're not obviously I'm not modeling the park after Disneyland it's more of like like this first episode was based off of California's Great America and this thing called Europa Park in Germany it's a rust Germany I believe so I'm trying to like pull inspiration from a bunch of theme parks all around the world
9623737	9624017	All right.
9625537	9626298	My final thought.
9627298	9629058	More streams this week on my personal channel.
9629078	9632739	So if you're not following me yet at Rob Roberts, please consider it here on Twitch.
9632839	9644942	We'll probably do some Diablo 4 this week, you know, because there's a big event going on right now for extra XP and then probably more Final Fantasy 14 because I'm down to two classes to get to level 90 before the expansion comes out.
9644982	9645842	And that's Warrior.
9645862	9650843	I've got to get all 10 levels and then I have to get about three more levels on Dragoon because I finished off Monk.
9650903	9652784	So we'll get the rest to 90.
9653564	9655925	because Dawn Trail is out in less than three weeks.
9656166	9656946	The clock is ticking.
9657727	9659928	That also reminds me, we're going to be streaming on Saturday too.
9660188	9660628	Oh, nice.
9661089	9661869	We have another stream day.
9662530	9662890	Sweet.
9663230	9663570	All right.
9664131	9668013	Well, with that, we are going to wrap it up and we'll see you in seven days.
9668093	9670114	So start the clock and we'll see you in seven days.
9670554	9671375	Have a good night, everybody.
9671675	9671915	Bye.
