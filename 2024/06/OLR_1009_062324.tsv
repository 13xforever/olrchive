39895	42276	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42336	46359	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46479	57405	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live with you all once again with episode number 1009 for tonight, June the 23rd of 2024.
58986	62988	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as joined by my co-hosts.
63168	65470	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66350	66771	Hello.
67051	68952	Hello, hello, and happy birthday.
70669	71470	Thanks!
71770	72010	I'm 22.
99910	101512	We've been radioing.
101692	106315	We've been doing this shit, trademark patent bending, for 22 years.
108477	111660	Yes, we've been powered by vibes for 22 years.
112500	112821	All right.
113561	117745	Yeah, because that's, I don't know, is that what they're calling it these days?
117865	118325	Vibes?
118405	119846	Vibes, oh yeah, oh yeah.
120027	121768	I thought they were just poppers in spite.
121928	122549	Yeah.
123843	125666	Oh wait, that's for the club, never mind.
125746	128390	I believe that's what Justin Timberlake had in his system.
128971	135401	But anyway, let me say hello to the one and only, of course, it wouldn't be a birthday without Techmaster Loki.
136282	136602	Hello.
136763	137804	Hey Loki, how are you doing?
138541	140922	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
157868	178631	and Loki oftentimes has games because he doesn't want to show the world his kitchen and I understand that I respect that so he has games that play behind him so what what game is this tonight because I'm not familiar with this although it looks very like this earthbound in 2024 it's it's like a Zelda like it's called hashtag blood b-l-u-d okay it's basically a uh
179468	188434	Like a Zelda-like game where you are a girl that's a transfer to a new town and she ends up involved in vampire hunting.
188894	189295	Cool.
190135	192877	Yeah, but it looks like a Saturday morning cartoon.
193197	193498	Okay.
193718	195239	Oh, that happened when I moved to California.
195599	196540	You turned into a vampire?
197460	198641	No, I turned into a vampire hunter.
198901	200142	Oh, sorry.
201803	202544	What is a man?
202584	204085	A miserable little pile of secrets.
204965	205326	Crash.
206346	207207	But enough talk.
207607	208328	How about you?
209332	237414	that's that's what you mean when you say Vampire Hunter is just you you learned how to play many different versions of Symphony of the Night as well as um what the hell is that I can't even remember the original name of Castlevania 5 at this point oh my god embarrassed Castlevania 5 what you mean Rondo of Blood yes Rondo of Blood that was just Dracula X it was kind of its own thing yeah well wasn't that the one they ported the Super Nintendo was Castlevania 5 and it was like
237853	241397	No, they brought that over as Castlevania Bloodlines, I think.
242138	244941	What was the one that was Super Castlevania 5 or whatever?
245001	246623	It was Super Castlevania 4.
247564	248205	No, I know there was that.
248225	252550	There was a Castlevania 5, but it was funky.
252950	256454	And I think it was just a bad port of Rondo of Blood, if I remember right.
257775	258156	Hold on.
259985	268648	Yeah, that was Dracula X. But it was just, I mean, I had never seen it on the package.
269028	275171	I just always thought it was, no, Castlevania Bloodlines was the one that was on Genesis.
276791	278872	But this was just Dracula X.
279747	285512	Yeah, and it just, it was weird because it felt like Konami, it just felt weird.
286132	289435	They just slapped the name on it even though it was the same quality.
289515	291376	The port wasn't any way on the Super Nintendo.
291536	293498	I think the port was good for what it was.
294419	298282	If no one had known about the TurboGrafx version, it would have been just fine.
298302	298622	Mm-hmm.
300253	301434	Yeah, true, true, true.
302696	305719	DarkSakura says it's on the Castlevania Advance Collection randomly.
305799	308602	Yeah, no, I mean, it's still there, so there is that.
309624	315410	Anyway, I do want to thank our chatters because I do see that a hype train is going as we are taping live here.
315450	318574	It looks to be a little bit of a birthday hype train, so just want to
318954	319314	Every day.
346505	347246	Yeah, I guess that's true.
347286	347766	I guess that's true.
347886	350187	I mean, who doesn't celebrate myself every day?
350307	353849	How many times can Ubisoft put out Beyond Good and Evil Remastered?
353969	355850	I mean, the limit does not exist, right?
355950	361013	So I guess we can celebrate one more time this year if we want to.
361793	362554	But yeah, no, I just...
363214	364916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
384276	413338	um you know with all that and um we actually will get the occasional comment now on our YouTube channel which is nice so um I want to give a shout out to uh the comment from underworld7949 on our last episode who said I love your show you guys and gal make me laugh and very informative lol with three exclamation points so you know they mean it so thank you for that three entire exclamation points that's right I am honored yes so thank you for that not a single interrobang I mean because that's what I think every time I'm live
414915	417318	Oh, gosh.
417518	418440	I so want to ask you.
418460	422865	Why do you hang out with me, really?
423226	425228	Because there are jokes that I can make.
425909	430154	I mean, there's a lot of reasons, but there are jokes I can make that only you understand.
432257	433679	You speak a certain level of nerd.
434725	450940	Yeah, well, after a while, I think that friends like, especially, well, not even I would say just friends in general, but like people, when they are around each other a lot, you know, I think that people develop like an entire communication system between them.
451833	452274	Oh, yeah.
452394	464963	Oh, that is so obvious watching the Trixie and Katya stuff online, you know, two drag queens, which is funny because my understanding is they don't really hang out outside of that.
465043	475171	But that is a conscious artistic choice to keep those podcasts and those things that they do like pure, like that really is the way they catch up and get to talk to each other is by doing those shows.
475611	477332	And so, yeah, you see a lot of that.
477372	480895	But they definitely seem to speak a language that is like mental telepathy.
481275	482656	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
502648	526855	Nintendo did a direct this week and there's a lot to say about it so I'll have Loki get us into that in just a moment but DarkSakura I'm curious um you know you know we love to talk about a little dead by daylight on this show and I'm kind of curious and I'm going to warn the listeners I am going to go into potential spoiler but it's based on rumors territory have you heard the rumors I'm sure you have that are really gaining steam about Tuesday's survivor announcement
527597	527917	And who is?
527937	529258	It's going to be Lara Croft.
529278	530258	It's going to be Lara Croft.
530438	530678	Yeah.
530798	534539	I haven't been paying attention to it, but it's been everywhere all over my feed.
534599	537020	So I'm just like, maybe?
537260	538101	I think that's it.
538181	549244	Well, and it fits with all the stuff because they said in a previous, one of their, you know, direct to fans transmissions that this next survivor embodies what it is to be a survivor.
549364	557107	And when you put that in the context of like Lara Croft in the last trilogy, it's like, oh yeah, that quote makes perfect sense for that character.
557367	559448	Hasn't she had enough bad days?
559508	560129	She really has.
560169	563131	She's going to be stuck in the realm dying every day.
563411	564291	But here's the thing.
564351	566433	Here's the thing about Lara Croft in Dead by Daylight.
566753	569074	I'm sure she'll look fantastic and she'll play fantastic.
569855	575098	If they do a legendary $10 skin, they better have triangle tits, Lara Croft.
576079	579861	I will switch my mane to triangle tits, Lara Croft.
580842	585405	And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go look at a PlayStation 1 port of Tomb Raider.
586522	590063	Who has been this ultimate survivor thing?
590123	594444	I haven't seen any pre-release stuff.
594564	598465	I think they said it in the anniversary broadcast when they were teasing their roadmap.
598965	599946	They said something about that.
600286	604047	So are we going to have a showdown between Pyramid Head and Pyramid Boob?
605367	606327	One can only hope.
608148	612169	I don't think they specifically mentioned anything about Tomb Raider.
612785	615187	No, no, they didn't say two, but they just said a new survivor.
616028	624234	They said something about the new survivor embodies what, yeah, it could, but when you look at Lara Croft, you go, oh, but the rumor is not just about that quote.
624314	630198	It's just one of those, when you look back at some of those really stretch hints they've dropped, they do fit.
630379	632540	I mean, it could be Reba McEntire.
634322	636183	Don't get my hopes up like that, y'all.
636403	642448	You know, a single mom who loves her kids, works two jobs, and all that.
643490	644252	She's a survivor.
646758	650306	And as she's on the hook, she's screaming, here's your one chance, fancy, don't let me down.
650326	652291	Or no, you should get me down.
652311	652671	Exactly, exactly.
656457	663399	Anyway, I hope it is Lara Croft and just because I want the triangle tits skin and nothing would really make me happier.
663439	671101	Although I don't think, I think we would get more like this is her original look and this is her like professor look.
671121	672641	She has different costumes in the games.
672961	676802	I'm sure they'd give her some of those, but I don't think we would actually get triangle tits.
676822	683224	You know what I would like is for them to give the other survivors voice lines now since all the new ones have them.
683464	683844	Mm-hmm.
684551	688012	But I want Dwight to sound like Dwight from the Salmonation one.
688852	691093	Oh, I'm going to go stay in my locker.
692873	696435	D'Artisio points out, I mean, if they got Nicolas Cage, anything is possible.
696775	700896	Speaking of Dead by Daylight actors and actresses, although she's... Jennifer Tilly?
701796	702056	Hello!
702076	702617	Oh, yes.
702877	703658	Oh, God, I love her.
704578	712405	Even though she's not in the game, I did think of you, DarkSakura, because I was at a horror convention locally this weekend because they were gracious enough to have me hosting the cosplay contest, which was great.
712825	715487	But Shawnee Smith, who played Amanda, a.k.a.
715527	717709	the pig in the Saw movies, was actually there.
717809	724114	So I saw her from a distance, but her table was packed, obviously, so I didn't wait around to say hi to her.
724194	726996	But, yeah, I thought of you because I know you love Amanda, so...
728769	731913	Yeah, and the funny, I'd like, I haven't seen the movies.
731973	736378	I mean, I've watched like enough put together scenes that I could avoid all the parts I don't want to watch.
736478	736839	Exactly.
736919	739422	I don't, I actually don't care for the movies at all.
739442	741785	But I understand why people are into them.
741805	742286	It's crazy.
742626	743127	The character.
743747	760588	But I like the actress too Yeah, that's the thing I can say I don't like the movies Because they're literally not for me It's like a cake that's a flavor I don't like I can still say this is a good cake for somebody It probably tastes real good But this is not a cake for me
761309	765711	Well, I'm sure that the creator is sitting back going, well, I didn't make it for you.
767711	769712	Isn't that a Frank-in-Furter line in Rocky Horror Fiction?
769752	770552	That is a Frank-in-Furter.
770572	772373	I was like, oh, I don't like guys with too many muscles.
772453	773713	I didn't make him for you.
773853	775374	I didn't make him for you.
776674	777695	She gets him anyway.
777775	778495	Oop, plot giveaway.
780415	787158	Although, you will be proud of me because I did bust out on stream in response to a friend, one of my favorite Frank-in-Furter lines.
787398	787578	Hmm.
788473	792436	it's so hard having a good time even smiling makes my face ache
794211	795452	Um, oh my God.
795472	801458	Uh, I was going to say though, one thing about the Saw movies and cakes, um, the acting is really good.
801558	807162	I can still say those movies are not for me, but I recognize that like Tobin Bell especially is very, very good in those movies.
807222	808664	And Shawnee Smith is very good as well.
809064	812327	So like they're very well acted in the main roles anyway.
812367	817471	A lot of the, you know, other roles are a little silly, but, um, the, the main roles are acted very, very well.
817671	818832	So I'll give it that.
819393	819613	All right.
820533	835657	Anyway, let's get into the news I think y'all really want to hear about, which is, you know, and we knew this would happen at some point, that Nintendo would just come out and say, you know what, we feel like doing a direct tomorrow at the crack of dawn, so get up and be ready.
836037	837137	And what did they do on Monday?
837537	840538	They said Tuesday, get up, 7 a.m., we've got some games to announce.
841178	842078	Get up, get your coffee.
842098	845119	It's like, listen up, bitches, a 10 is speaking.
846539	849000	Literally, a Nintendo is speaking.
852919	855120	Listen up, bitches, a Ninten is speaking.
856120	859882	All right, so Loki, what did our Ninten have to say?
861603	870647	Well, there was lots of game announcements, a lot of third-party stuff shown, but pretty much a lot of the core Nintendo franchises have announcements.
870747	874808	Loki, if they showed third-party announcements, did they happen to show Just Dance 2025?
877522	879683	If only anyone could have predicted that.
880203	880763	If only.
880983	882384	Like, it was so unexpected.
882404	883704	Like, oh my god.
883724	884844	I know.
885004	885485	Who knew?
885985	889186	It's like literally betting that, like, it's like reverse roulette.
889226	890126	You're betting on the wheel.
890606	893307	Any number except double zero will come up.
893427	894587	It's pretty good odds.
895448	895688	Anyway.
895728	895868	Yeah.
897520	907687	So we had starting things off Mario & Luigi Brothership, which is a brand new entry into the Mario & Luigi franchise, and it looks pretty cool.
907747	909508	I like the art style that they have there.
909768	914871	It's nice that the series is continuing, because if I'm not mistaken, the studio that used to make it... In like nine years or something like that?
914951	915832	Well, the studio's...
916232	918133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
932403	936224	We got another trailer for Nintendo World Championship NES Edition.
937485	938585	Which I'm really hyped about.
938685	941746	As somebody really into retro, I think this looks fucking rad.
941806	943547	I think it'll be a fun game to stream.
943947	944567	I really do.
944607	946567	Dan was saying he'd be interested in it too.
946708	947348	Let's do it.
947488	948868	I think that would be a fun game to stream.
949768	957711	I want to say hello in our chat to Rin Mari, who says, to be honest, I don't go into Nintendo Directs with any expectation at this point.
957731	958151	Rin-chan!
958531	960113	If I see stuff I like, great.
960233	961455	If not, life goes on.
961615	963677	Then again, I'm a weirdo who likes obscure shit.
963758	969825	No, you have to go into Nintendo Directs with that attitude or you will be disappointed every single time.
970185	972208	That is the right attitude to go into Directs with.
972288	977334	This is always the person I think of whenever anyone says Toho.
978811	987377	This is why Nintendo had to say, go out of their way to say, we will not be saying anything about Switch 2 in this.
987538	988919	Because that was part of the announcement as well.
988999	990980	I bet you bitches were still disappointed.
991621	994043	It's just the way Nintendo fans can be sometimes.
994143	996785	But yeah, no, that's the right attitude to approach Nintendo Direct.
997105	997465	Just...
998747	1000428	Be ready to absorb the information.
1000508	1001669	Set your expectations reasonable.
1001709	1011378	I don't even like to participate in the prediction game because people always just put these things out there that are just not realistic always.
1011639	1013160	They might get one right.
1013260	1014622	Again, roulette wheel analogy.
1014942	1018005	They might land on the right spot occasionally, but it's very, very rare.
1018345	1018565	Anyway.
1019826	1022988	Yeah, and so with that, they did show like a few new game modes.
1023028	1026810	So there's a survival mode where you're kind of competing different challenges with people.
1026871	1030993	It's almost like kind of the Tetris 100 or Mario 100 games that they had.
1033528	1035210	or 99, sorry, Tetris 99.
1035850	1045699	And also, I believe, I don't think they announced a release date before then, but it's coming out July 18th, so right around the corner for that.
1045999	1047020	Great.
1047721	1056248	Let's see, Fairy Tail 2, so another anime RPG that's going to be coming out this winter.
1057689	1060951	Then we had Fantasian Nero Dimension.
1061031	1061571	Fantasian.
1061751	1062251	Yay.
1063692	1066173	So that's coming out on the Switch this holiday.
1067173	1068574	And it's also multi-platform.
1068734	1071395	That means PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Steam.
1071775	1078138	So this game is like very clearly had a two-year exclusive agreement with Apple Arcade and a whole lot more people are going to get to play it now.
1078178	1080199	And I think it's, yeah, I'm really excited for Fantasian.
1080259	1081740	I've seen this game for over a year.
1082300	1087503	I would, yeah, you, and to be fair, I don't think a lot of people really discovered it on Apple Arcade.
1088504	1092046	So I think it's great that, you know, it's going to get that wider audience.
1092086	1094007	Again, the same thing would be- It's fucking delightful.
1094067	1096288	Yeah, and the same thing would be true about a game like Final Fantasy XVI.
1096308	1100630	When that goes, I don't know why my follow alert cheer just went off.
1100730	1101411	I apologize.
1101471	1103312	Somebody must have just followed my personal channel.
1104212	1104913	So sorry about that.
1105373	1106774	But that's what that noise was.
1106934	1108455	I thought I killed all those-
1109555	1138888	you guys didn't hear it but it makes a Windows 95 startup noise so anyway no please don't apologize for following my channel it's just I don't know why that's coming through on the VOG ones but I'll figure it out anyway with cutting edge development and technology we are now finally able to have basketball in Nintendo Switch Sports so that's going to be another free update that's coming later this summer
1139028	1139088	Um...
1168780	1172462	We have another game, Mio, or Memories in Orbit.
1174103	1175824	That's going to be coming out in 2025.
1177144	1180166	I like the art style with that.
1181327	1187290	We got another update video for Disney's Illusion Island.
1187350	1191772	They're going to be getting a brand new update called Mystery in Monoth.
1193093	1194614	And that is coming...
1195696	1218070	actually that came out already that was a day and date type of thing it's out now hello kitty island adventure game of the show 2025 I've had that game for a while on Apple Arcade it's cute another one going multi-platform at this point game of the show
1220514	1242737	Looney Tunes, Wacky World of Sports Not Game of the Show Among Us, getting a new update on the Switch with three new roles So that's kind of cool And that was also one of those day and date things Farmagia
1243872	1252021	It's a farming monster gathering sim that's going to be coming out November 1st on the Switch.
1254043	1255024	Did you say Farmagia?
1255785	1256665	Yeah, Farmagia.
1258387	1261671	My brain immediately thought you were going to say it's a game about cheese.
1264357	1282914	I can see where you would think that, yes I literally thought the Pope was here throwing around slurs again I thought that's what Loki said It's like they're trying to combine farm and magic and add an I and it's like farm magic I would seriously play a game about cheese though, I'm just letting you know
1283482	1286985	Hey, that's the special event in Pikmin Bloom right now is Cheese Pikmin.
1287726	1291209	I actually finished my set of Cheese Pikmin after like 15 days.
1291569	1293631	I never finish a set that early in the month.
1293691	1294872	Are they supposed to be flowers?
1294972	1295933	So they're cheese now?
1296093	1301137	No, in the mobile game, they get all sorts of things from real-life locations and stuff.
1301177	1304940	So they'll get Chinese food bowls from Chinese restaurants.
1306101	1309044	But then every month, they rotate in themes.
1309444	1311425	So last month we had playing cards.
1312425	1314945	The month before I think we had Easter eggs because it was April.
1315045	1316206	So June we have cheese.
1316786	1319066	And what's really cute, y'all ready for this?
1319106	1319606	Y'all ready for this?
1319927	1324508	What's really cute is that like, so the blue Pikmin gets blue cheese.
1325288	1327468	The white Pikmin I think gets white cheddar.
1327828	1333010	So they actually get like cheese that kind of matches their color or personality.
1333530	1335150	I don't know why it's funny, but it is.
1335270	1335630	Trust me.
1335710	1337291	And all together they stink.
1337971	1338631	That's right.
1341566	1342146	This is cool.
1342706	1347329	We have another remaster that's coming to the Nintendo Switch.
1347369	1350011	So Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.
1351031	1358316	It's coming out with they have 80 playable levels and two player co-op, including, I believe, the ones from the 3DS as well.
1358776	1359756	So they're adding that in there.
1359816	1361457	That's coming out January 16th.
1363440	1381672	um we got confirmation of Dragon Quest 3 uh HD 2D remake so done in that kind of Octopath Traveler style which looks awesome and that's coming November 14th and then along with that Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are also getting similar remasters but those are coming out next year
1382052	1383052	I can't wait for those.
1383172	1386253	That looked really good, the Dragon Quest.
1386473	1393696	I love this trend, and I've said this before, of the remakes in the Octopath Traveler engine because they've been getting a lot of mileage out of that engine.
1393756	1396917	I don't know what they call it internally, but it's very obvious.
1397157	1408460	We had Triangle Strategy, we had Octopath 2, we had Live Alive, and all these games have been remade in that engine.
1408480	1410241	So Dragon Quest coming out is great news.
1411448	1414409	Let's just get the Final Fantasy games remade in that.
1414649	1416449	How about fucking Chrono Trigger?
1417330	1417730	Or that.
1417830	1418650	Yeah, I'll take that too.
1418730	1420550	Yes.
1420590	1425292	We got another trailer for Funko Fusion, a game I keep forgetting that's out.
1425972	1426952	Yeah.
1427172	1429313	It's like Lego Dimensions looking, I guess.
1429333	1431313	I guess it's neat they got all the licenses.
1432894	1433494	I'll say that.
1433514	1434314	It licenses the game.
1434434	1435294	I said a nice thing.
1437015	1437815	Yeah, so...
1439717	1463222	another remake, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD that's gonna be coming out here I think this year New Dempa Man is getting a Switch version on July 22nd it's a free title Metal Slug Attack Reloaded that is like a tower defense Metal Slug game I
1464386	1468308	I know Jamie's going to take issue with what I'm about to say, but please forgive me.
1469028	1471269	I can't believe Metal Slug is still a thing.
1472129	1477371	Why should it not still be a thing?
1477431	1478611	It's great.
1478751	1482053	I'm a little shocked that it's still a thing.
1482573	1487415	We can't fucking get Mother 3 to save our lives, but here comes a new Metal Slug game.
1487435	1488175	Running guns are great.
1489155	1495421	The thing about Metal Slug is it's easy to just pick it up and play it until you're done getting killed.
1495521	1496883	Again, it's like the Saw movies.
1496923	1498084	I'm not saying it's bad.
1498164	1501247	I'm just saying I'm just a little surprised it's still going.
1501787	1503409	And it requires a little emotional investment.
1503902	1506523	But they haven't really done run-and-gun versions of the game recently.
1506763	1519325	They've had a tactics game, and then they have this now that is a tower defense game, which is cool that they're doing spinoffs, but... Ah, very good insight from QuestBuster in chat, who says, This Metal Slug used to be a gacha game.
1519765	1521846	It's being re-released without the gacha.
1521966	1523066	Oh, you love to see it.
1523126	1526867	The de-gacha-ing of games that get released.
1527227	1528107	You love to see that.
1528667	1532048	I wish that mobile game would get a Switch release.
1532748	1535110	That would have been like, what was the one?
1535351	1536812	Oh, it had a cult following.
1536872	1537853	People loved it.
1537973	1540035	And Nintendo pulled the plug on it not that long ago.
1540716	1541797	It was an original IP.
1543138	1543498	Damn it.
1543518	1544079	Why can't I remember?
1544099	1545580	Somebody in chat has to know what I'm talking about.
1546201	1548283	It was like a Dragalia Lost.
1548363	1548663	Thank you.
1548723	1549144	That was it.
1549184	1549784	Dragalia Lost.
1550265	1555009	I'm kind of shocked there hasn't been a like port of that de-gotcha'd for Switch.
1556290	1556731	Just saying.
1558781	1559542	Darkest Dungeon 2
1575788	1583214	So you're getting some Game Boy Advance titles, Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Metroid Zero Mission.
1583294	1583754	Yay!
1584275	1586116	Great release, finally.
1586196	1587117	That's a great one.
1587977	1592621	Turok, Dinosaur Hunter, and Perfect Dark.
1592781	1596504	I hear there's some issues with the emulation in those games, but hopefully Nintendo fixes it fast.
1598210	1603376	we had Phantom Brave Lost Hero do you know how horny people are for a new Phantom Brave game?
1604217	1607801	do you know how horny people are for that?
1608762	1619214	I knew it was popular I didn't know how underground popular it really is but people are very excited about that game let me tell you we had a
1620542	1622484	Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection
1644562	1659230	This is the first sign that maybe, just between this and Street Fighter VI, maybe, just maybe, Capcom vs. SNK, Capcom vs. SNK 2, and then SNK vs. Capcom can all be in a collection someday.
1660010	1660331	Maybe.
1661771	1662092	Please.
1662452	1664073	Super Mario Party.
1664093	1665633	Please, Nintendo.
1665714	1666514	Jamboree.
1666714	1668035	So, more minigames.
1668195	1669436	That's coming out October 17th.
1671728	1672709	And then...
1696379	1697380	You can do what I do.
1697900	1698380	Don't play them.
1698580	1699601	I won't, actually.
1700381	1714867	And I also understand to an extent that Nintendo is probably quote-unquote buying time because the Nintendo Switch 2 was probably supposed to be on their original plan, the big holiday thing that they were going to be talking about right now.
1715227	1718409	So I really view this Mario Party thing as a time filler.
1719609	1722330	And that's, I guess, its place right now.
1722530	1723831	But that's what it is.
1728257	1730038	Loki, you're muted at one point.
1759293	1760633	The traditional Zelda games.
1761094	1765735	And then now we're kind of moving into that whole new Zelda type territory.
1766915	1769536	Why did they have a problem putting a sword in that woman's hand?
1770936	1772777	I kind of agree with that, actually.
1773177	1779499	My biggest concern is that I just don't love the system of making a table.
1780419	1783960	But I'm also trying to give it the benefit of the doubt.
1784020	1787361	I want to play it to sort of see because I think what they're trying to do...
1787981	1793602	is that Nintendo's had a lot of success with the recent 3D, you know, Breath of the Wild, et cetera, with that open world concept.
1793682	1801924	And I think this is them trying to do the open world in a, I'm going to use my quotey fingers, 2D Zelda game, because at its core, it's a 2D Zelda game.
1803245	1816748	And so I'm kind of giving the benefit of the doubt that maybe it doesn't seem as weird as it did in that trailer, that maybe the combat will be a little better than throwing tables at people and having, you know, familiars that you summon that do the work for you.
1817388	1818569	Link's Awakening
1836912	1838213	I mean, it looks like an interesting game.
1838233	1839153	It looks like a fun game.
1839433	1842814	I would play it, but it's not what I wanted for a game featuring Zelda.
1843415	1843775	I'm sorry.
1843795	1845576	I'm laughing at what Miramuse said in chat.
1845636	1847617	Duplicate a new boyfriend and peace out.
1850154	1852035	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1870546	1870906	Link's Awakening
1888573	1889814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1910868	1911769	for better or for worse.
1912129	1918353	So I think this was probably the smartest thing Nintendo could do in the type of situation they're in.
1919854	1925537	I still wish they'd just give the woman a sword too, yes, but I'm curious.
1925898	1927579	I'm very, very curious how it's going to play out.
1929200	1931541	Yeah.
1931641	1939887	And at least it's not a 3DO Zelda game, because Zelda has been the star of a Zelda game before, but we're not going to talk about the 3DO anymore.
1942201	1969422	and then of course Just Dance 2025 who cares it better still have Rasputin in it well it's all selling their track pack's selling the online mode now I think I maybe recognized one song in that trailer that they had but I did laugh when it came up I did laugh and I said you know just again I know it was probably the world's safest prediction to make but I did laugh I was like of course of course it's in Nintendo Direct yeah
1970766	1974587	We got another trailer for LEGO Horizon Adventure showing off the Switch version.
1974607	1977488	So that's coming this holiday as well.
1978628	1982649	We had the announcement that Stray is being ported to the Nintendo Switch.
1983569	1983909	That's cool.
1983929	1985449	So that's going to be pretty cool.
1985729	1988530	And sorry, Dartistry is correcting me and saying it was a CDI game.
1988950	1996111	I mean, at this point, 3DO, CDI all live in that realm of shit that was too expensive when I was a kid and didn't really have any good games on them anyway.
1996631	1997692	So, but thank you.
1997752	1999132	Yes, I should get that correct.
1999152	1999532	So thank you.
2000680	2004143	They have a brand new Hobbit game called Tales of the Shire.
2005504	2007145	It is... Animal Crossing for Hobbits?
2007845	2009326	Probably, yeah.
2010187	2010748	It looks like that.
2010968	2016172	Since I'm hating on franchises, why don't I just say I don't care about The Hobbit as a franchise.
2016312	2017453	I do not care about The Hobbit.
2017493	2018834	I know I'm special.
2018934	2019694	Ooh, she's different.
2019774	2023137	But I have to say it, like every time a trailer... I'm like, who's buying these games?
2023157	2025478	Because it's not me and it's not anybody I know.
2025899	2026139	Rob?
2026319	2027140	Are you buying these games?
2028083	2028503	Hell no.
2028824	2031607	I was about to say, I don't care about the Hobbit titles either.
2032548	2045963	I only really have cared about the books, and the books, honestly enough, if it was Tolkien describing the scenery, he'd spend three fucking pages on it, and then one page of fighting, and that's it.
2046533	2076159	yeah and to even even the Lord of the Rings fanboys would be upset when it comes to the video games because does anybody remember the Gollum game we were just talking about about a year ago anyone remember how that turned out so anyway sorry I just yeah that was that was very much a get a snack and water break when they were showing that game Gollum just as a name makes me think of like a bad excuse uh for like six I'm sorry I can't go out tonight I've got the Gollum
2081772	2083353	I don't know why I'm doing that with a British accent either.
2083373	2085875	I don't know why either, but it adds so much to it.
2089257	2095180	I'll tell you what, I have been playing Dead by Daylight with Shayla and her Scottish boyfriend, Ryan, who is amazing.
2095400	2096821	I'm just so sorry.
2097322	2100664	I have to send my regrets because I've come down with a case of the golem.
2101944	2103125	It's such a tragedy, really.
2103365	2107988	I've got the golem and they're out of golemite, so... Alas.
2108669	2108949	Alas.
2110703	2134922	I shall retire with my new pet, Gustarian Honk I may have been watching some Baldur's Gate stuff Okay, stop making this game sound cool Next Oh, we can make it cool with voices Next we have Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Much cooler That one's got stuff that never came out in the US Mm-hmm
2135649	2143691	Yeah, and then what's cool about it though is they've also remastered it and they still have the original graphics as well in case you don't want the remastered graphics.
2144472	2145532	So that's pretty cool.
2147973	2150814	The 100 line Last Defense Academy.
2151994	2152414	I don't know.
2152874	2156735	I think this must have been something I skipped past in the trailers when I was watching.
2158816	2159136	What else?
2159596	2162017	Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven.
2163237	2165878	So that's going to be coming out as well very soon.
2166738	2174559	And then last but not least, we finally got a look at Metroid Prime 4, now titled Metroid Prime 4 Beyond.
2174599	2175679	This is totally a Switch 2 game.
2175780	2176300	A look?
2176480	2180120	That was a 25-cent peekaboo that we got at that game.
2180320	2182221	It was like, now with more motion sickness.
2182661	2183641	Ta-da!
2183841	2190522	That was... That looks like a Switch 2 game, being that it's coming out sometime in 2025.
2190743	2192503	There's a reason they didn't show much.
2193322	2215956	they've got much more to show like and again I'm trying very careful not to get the hype train going too much but look we all know a Switch 2 is coming in 2025 like the world's worst kept secret and then you know that means that Metroid Prime 4 would make a really good candidate for a you know multi-platform release title so I really feel like they were holding back with that trailer but it is nice to see
2217219	2217699	It's real.
2218480	2219481	After all this time, right?
2219501	2221282	Like, yes, this is actually happening.
2221342	2223084	Yes, gird your loins.
2223964	2225746	A Metroid Prime 4 is actually happening.
2226566	2227767	We even gave it a subtitle.
2227947	2228708	We're that serious.
2231610	2232011	There you go.
2233392	2234172	That's the Nintendo Direct.
2234192	2235954	So what did you think overall of the Nintendo Direct?
2235974	2237875	It was a direct.
2239076	2239557	It did things.
2239597	2239957	I don't know.
2240217	2241218	There were things shown.
2241538	2244140	Mm-hmm.
2244180	2245681	So I have some emotions.
2245982	2246182	Mm-hmm.
2247179	2248740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2272116	2300972	but I was kind of like okay yeah like they're doing what they need to do to get through this holiday like a new Zelda game and Mario Party whatever even if I don't care you know somebody does and some of these other you know in the third party so that like they're showing the things they need to show to make people still care about Switch and still sell these Switches through this holiday I think they did what they needed to do so I think it was good on that reason like is it the best direct they've ever done I don't think so but it's it was a very good gap year direct
2303393	2307799	So, yeah, DarkTC in chat says, there was a lot I was happy with and stuff I did not expect.
2308219	2311884	Again, congrats to the free MVC2 folks for getting what they wanted.
2311944	2320815	Yeah, I feel like a lot of, like, you know, between the MVC2, a new Phantom Brave, the Ace Attorney localization, like, I feel like...
2321916	2342416	a lot of little like underground things finally got that release people have been waiting well I don't know if Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really underground but you know what I mean like things that are that have not been at the forefront of gamer memories or sometimes are getting all these releases that are making people very happy except for you mother 3 you can choke apparently that's that was a Nintendo quote not me
2343547	2347268	Yeah, and Bobby Blackwell points out no F-Zero GX remaster.
2347628	2359132	That's because, Bobby, whenever you see F-Zero GX on a leaked sheet, my uncle works at Nintendo, leaked document, whenever you see F-Zero GX, you know it's not happening.
2359592	2360413	It's not happening.
2361953	2366915	So, Nintendo says you'll take an F-Zero track in Mario Kart and you'll like it.
2367375	2369456	Now shut up.
2369636	2370576	That's where we're at with that.
2370987	2373108	We gave you a new F-Zero game, remember?
2373288	2375969	F-Zero 99 or whatever the thing was.
2376069	2385014	There was F-Zero 9, you're right, we had that, and then we had that, we had a reference in Nintendo Land, or whatever, I don't even remember what the Wii U launch game was called.
2385314	2386534	Was it Nintendo Land?
2386574	2387575	Okay, it was Nintendo Land.
2387855	2394338	There was a whisper of F-Zero, there was a hint, there was a breath of F-Zero content in that game as well.
2395059	2398000	There you go, and now we're gonna make four more Pikmin games.
2398530	2407912	You know, Ranmari in chat with an excellent point too, to be quite honest, saying Nintendo hypothetically releases a new F-Zero that isn't a remaster and everyone complains it's not as good as GX.
2408792	2410332	Maybe that is what they're worried of.
2410552	2413353	And it's a legit concern.
2413973	2416194	F-Zero GX can be a very hard thing to top.
2417294	2422935	Maybe their hardware can't achieve the frame rate that's required for...
2424398	2426339	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2448086	2448827	It was alright.
2449007	2450808	I played a little bit of Baldur's Gate 3.
2451389	2458233	I played, of course, mostly Dead by Daylight because of the anniversary event going on.
2459334	2460875	Just trying to work my way through the tome.
2464449	2489288	I didn't actually really play anything other than those two and that stupid RuPaul game that I need to stop playing but I've really been putting my focus on Dead by Daylight just to get through the anniversary stuff because you know me I have to have all the cosmetics all of them I saw they released an outfit for the pig and I thought although I think that's just one that's just give me your money
2490373	2491594	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2516095	2519137	Yeah, it is, but I'm not going to go into like hyper detail about it.
2519257	2543173	It's just that one of the hobbies that I am very deeply involved in that makes me very happy, the person that runs the facility is very passive aggressive, like super passive aggressive and likes to talk down at the adult class or basically anybody.
2543994	2545675	And I'm just going to throw this out there.
2546896	2554261	Telling a bunch of adults to put away their phones because it sets a good example for the children doesn't mean that we have to put away our phones.
2555142	2557644	And my response to that was, what phone?
2557924	2562348	Not one of us had our phones out.
2563208	2568032	And also, when you have a parent in the group, no, parent has to have their phone on them if they've got kids.
2568572	2570794	End of story.
2570974	2573036	I'm getting to the point where
2575618	2575738	No.
2576098	2578079	You know, I still enjoy... Okay, it's ballet.
2578440	2579280	I still enjoy dancing.
2580181	2583082	But I'm getting to the point where I don't want to do the big productions.
2585403	2589366	I agree, though, that it's really annoying when somebody comes out, especially in that tone.
2589666	2590366	And y'all know that tone.
2590386	2592167	It's that passive-aggressive tone.
2592227	2597490	They tell everybody, you need to follow this rule, and literally nobody is breaking the rule currently in the room.
2598010	2598591	Because they know.
2598691	2599932	Yeah.
2600012	2601152	That annoys me, too.
2601572	2601973	Like, a lot.
2601993	2602793	There's some other stuff.
2602813	2603093	Yeah.
2605140	2632275	it's very unprofessional and there's a bunch of other stuff going on that is sort of coming to a head with me anyway but there's a much better way in that situation you can say that like I understand sometimes you have to go but there's what you could say oh and thank you I see nobody has your phones nobody has their phones out thank you so much for respecting what we would either there's other ways you could do it this was to be petty passive aggressive yeah this was to be petty yeah it was obvious silly so
2634278	2636119	Anyway, let's move on.
2636179	2640001	That was a throwback to the FUs of the week, by the way, for those following with the at-home game.
2640681	2642102	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2643562	2646023	My gaming week was mostly just playing Minecraft.
2646244	2651806	So I was just getting ready for the one-chunk challenge judging today, which we did and shot.
2652046	2655848	And so, yeah, it was pretty much the whole week doing that.
2655948	2659970	Oh, and downloading games that I'll probably never get to, like the one behind me.
2661519	2664281	So the YouTube is not out for that, what you were doing today yet.
2664361	2664821	That's coming.
2665201	2665781	No, not yet.
2666362	2668883	I have to edit a lot of stuff.
2669223	2669984	Yep, I understand.
2670024	2670444	I gotcha.
2670644	2670924	Alright.
2672425	2672845	Let's see.
2673485	2674206	My gaming week.
2674306	2678168	Honestly, it's been a lot of the similar stuff that I've been playing recently.
2678928	2680689	Still going in Final Fantasy XIV.
2680729	2682330	You know, Dawn Trail's out on Friday.
2682970	2686792	So by the time we have our show next week, I will have a new Final Fantasy XIV expansion to consume.
2686812	2687072	Yay!
2687612	2689393	And I got another class to 90.
2689894	2694436	So every single class except for Warrior is now level 90.
2694576	2700999	But I don't know if I'll get Warrior to 90 in time because I really only have until... I think the game goes down on Wednesday.
2701479	2708423	So I really only have tomorrow and Tuesday and tonight, I guess, to try to get Warrior to 90 really fast, which I probably...
2708943	2713848	I might be able to do if I'm willing to just chain run dungeons over and over, but it's going to be a tall order.
2714849	2724559	So we'll see if I make it or not, but very happy that Dawn Trail's on its way out because there's going to be a lot more to do on Final Fantasy XIV.
2725540	2725980	Let's see...
2727962	2754736	I also have been playing, I even played a little bit of Dead by Daylight I'm not as up on that game as I used to be But I was like, okay, I should sign in and cash in all these blood point codes And get some of these cakes on some of my characters I'm talking about the anniversary cakes that give you additional blood points in a match I'm not talking about a fluffy butt or anything like that Even if I do play as Chris Redfield And Carlos, I kind of go back and forth between Chris and Carlos
2755977	2756477	Uh, let's see.
2756517	2757438	Basically the same character.
2757558	2759099	Yeah, well, they're all Leon, basically.
2759139	2760300	Except I don't play Leon, really.
2760460	2765965	Although, I would, I should buy that Leon skin that looks like the Roaring Twenties.
2766565	2767847	I don't know the Resident Evil franchise.
2767867	2768387	Oh, the noir.
2768747	2768968	Yeah.
2769228	2769728	The noir outfit.
2769888	2772691	It was one of his special outfits.
2772991	2773832	Okay.
2774052	2774392	In the game.
2774592	2777214	If I had that outfit, I'd probably play as Leon more often.
2777555	2778355	So, um...
2779136	2800396	I just go back and forth between all three of them but pretty much most of my points have been spent on them and then Cheryl because not only do I play as Cheryl I play as Lisa and I play as I don't know why but I play as James I don't know why I bought that skin but I did it's like one of those like why did I do that but um you know whatever um well you know I'm still a Meg Mane really I'm sorry to hear that no I'm just kidding
2801229	2807310	I've actually been trying to spread out my cakes because, you know, I collect all the anniversary and event stuff.
2807570	2807770	Yeah.
2808210	2810831	I like to have either two or four of them because of my mental problems.
2811751	2815092	But I've got some stuff on Vecna now and I'm about ready to adapt them.
2815812	2819453	I still have 70, like, year seven cakes on Chris.
2820693	2825914	So one of these days I just need to play with you and bring all my cakes and get some blood points.
2826974	2830237	Diablo 4 Diablo 5 Diablo 6 Diablo 7
2852458	2854459	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2873766	2875727	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2899178	2926510	Bobby Blackwolf will be hosting some of the, which I believe Sunday's the first day, and Bobby Blackwolf's gonna have some of the first games that are run, including Mega Man 9, Ratchet & Clank, and Splatoon 3 are the games that are being speedrun, and then he's also gonna be hosting some games on Monday, which is, oh no, I guess those Sunday games go into Monday, depending on the time, but then the games he's doing on Tuesday are Like a Dragon Gaiden,
2927290	2930660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2936001	2937823	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2960041	2961642	But in the name of charity, I'll allow it.
2962483	2965605	I know that these charity marathons are a lot of fun.
2965945	2967146	So yeah, go check out Bobby.
2967166	2969687	You know, again, the speed runners are the real stars of the show.
2970067	2971849	And even Bobby would be the first to admit that.
2971969	2976672	But Bobby will be there and you will hear his voice on stream, reading donations and all that good stuff.
2977032	2978293	I am also told...
2978993	2979934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2997446	3022082	including a panel room a room where people practice their speed runs and play console games a room where they have arcade games set up there are lots of things happening at Summer Games Done Quick outside of what you just see on stream so Jason is there to help some of the rest of that all happen so that's pretty cool so I didn't I didn't realize VOG Network was so involved with this uh none of us here at OLR are maybe we should be I don't know but no it's it's it's neat that uh
3023122	3023703	It's neat.
3024463	3030107	But it's a big investment, too, because they've got to go out to Minneapolis, I think it's at, for several days.
3030167	3031388	Bobby's going to be there several days.
3031428	3032669	I don't know if he's there the entire week.
3033409	3034170	Actually, maybe he is.
3034490	3035771	I think he did say Sunday to Sunday.
3036331	3037953	So that's a long trip.
3037993	3039514	He's there the entire time.
3039654	3040274	Oh, my gosh.
3041055	3041455	Wow.
3042476	3043737	Eight nights in a hotel.
3043857	3046599	Well, somebody's going to hit their reward status.
3047932	3049554	from Summer Game Stunt Quick.
3049654	3054881	All right, let's move on and get into some gaming news and what else is going on in the industry this week.
3055342	3056684	Loki, we will start with you.
3057685	3065115	Yep, so we've got basically news that Sony's not going to be at Gamescom, which kind of makes sense if you think about it because...
3065953	3075837	You know, if there's not a whole lot to show this year, maybe they're, I don't know if they're working on another platform already, but Why doesn't Sony have as much to show?
3076598	3077998	Like, that's just weird to me.
3078078	3078599	No, and I get it.
3078719	3079599	Like, I'm not questioning.
3079639	3084301	Like, I too have seen, Sony's in a weird place, I feel like.
3084441	3085622	This is very weird.
3089965	3114825	I don't know, well maybe it's more of a thing that they just want their own event or something, maybe it's just not going to be at Gamescom but yeah, so they're not showcasing anything upcoming at Gamescom 2024, which is confirmed by Eurogamer also, Nintendo's not going to be at Gamescom either, so I don't know, Xbox is I mean, I guess you know, I mean Nintendo I still feel like has more
3115851	3119233	Coming down the pipeline after their recent direct than Sony does right now.
3120074	3122296	Maybe that's just perspective of the things I'm into.
3122456	3123116	I can admit that.
3123957	3127419	It could just be that, I mean, well, Nintendo doesn't necessarily have any reason to.
3127539	3129321	And Sony's like, well, I'm going to be cool at Nintendo.
3130001	3135645	Well, it's weird, though, because, like, Sony's, like, some of the stuff that they revealed were only, like, quarter three stuff.
3135866	3137667	So it was like, you know, you had...
3138527	3147800	Concord, which is August 23rd, Astrobot, which is September 6th, and the God of War Ragnarok PC port, which is September 17th.
3147980	3151185	So do you think they're sitting on holiday announcements they've yet to reveal?
3152946	3153907	Um, maybe?
3154327	3154867	I mean, they could.
3154887	3157569	Didn't Sony do an August thing one year?
3157789	3159970	And they put all their holiday stuff in the August announcement?
3159990	3165553	I could see, yeah, August or Tokyo Game Show maybe, which would be early September to announce.
3165573	3169635	That's kind of early for, or late for some of that stuff.
3169855	3170856	But, um...
3173266	3178008	I think the Switch showed you don't need as extensive of a hype train for these types of things.
3178588	3180249	You know, word travels fast, right?
3180850	3181230	I don't know.
3181250	3187713	They just don't really have anything big for holiday unless there's another Spider-Man game coming or something like that.
3188494	3188914	I don't know.
3189194	3189314	Hmm.
3191331	3192913	I don't know, it just feels weird.
3192973	3193875	Something feels off.
3193975	3198220	I don't know how else to put it that makes sense, but something just feels off.
3198261	3205791	Maybe it's just as simple as Sony will announce more in August, and then it will feel better, I guess, but just something feels really off with Sony.
3206812	3207994	Yeah, well...
3210307	3235805	I guess we'll just wait and see well unfortunately we know this studio has been off for some time and it's the Embracer Group and boy oh boy a series of bad business decisions has led to yet another studio being closed Embracer Group CEO had originally said last month that oh the restructuring efforts and all that have ended and guess what he lied
3236525	3245215	Again, because this last week, Embracer closed Pieces Interactive.
3245736	3250781	They did the remake to Alone in the Dark, which, you know, I'll admit...
3251482	3257067	I really could care less about an Alone in the Dark remake, and I'm not sure why this was the game that had to be remade.
3257467	3269678	But I also sort of fault Lars Wingfors, who is the Embracer Group CEO, who has the final say on what gets greenlit and what doesn't for this game ever being made in the first place.
3270138	3279026	And so even if the game did not perform to expectations or whatever, again, to what extent does that fall on the CEO and the board?
3281149	3283851	but unfortunately it is the studio that will now suffer.
3284372	3287694	Pisces Interactive confirming its closure on its own website.
3288055	3290457	The studio originally founded in 2007.
3291277	3292799	They made over 10 games.
3293239	3296722	They worked with THQ on an expansion for Titan Quest.
3297402	3304307	They did another Titan Quest expansion under Embracer and then they did the remake of Alone in the Dark which launched in March.
3305388	3307549	But apparently the game did not do well.
3308630	3321438	Embracer's report on the 2024 fiscal year said Alone in the Dark saw a positive reception from users but a mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.
3321799	3326582	Well then maybe management needs to be learning how to set their expectations more appropriately.
3327302	3353895	but um you know they're never going to take accountability because they never do in this country anyway and what they expect from low in the dark or even you're actually an embracer i'm sorry embracer is europe and so you know or over there so yeah like i don't know what they expected with this game anyways i mean like yeah david harbour is you know it he's a great actor but like that's not gonna draw people to the game necessarily and alone dark such a
3355369	3358972	Old franchise that probably no one knows about anymore.
3359312	3362435	And it's a period piece type of game.
3362655	3365798	It's very niche.
3365918	3368600	It's solid AA territory there.
3368920	3371582	And they're charging $60 for it, which I think is too high.
3373524	3376546	Maybe $50, $40, probably better.
3376706	3378928	But they really need to scale it down.
3379008	3382531	And even then, it's just not...
3383815	3387678	Not gonna sell a ton because people don't know what it is.
3387698	3389520	It's not Resident Evil.
3389540	3396246	CEOs everywhere are having a really rude awakening on what gamers are willing to pay $60 or $70 for.
3397227	3409477	And this has been a problem for years, obviously, but this is really starting to come to a head that we're seeing with all these layoffs and this disappointing expectations and all this stuff is that there really is only so much you can get away with charging $70 for.
3411414	3427564	I thought they were geniuses that's why they're paid like billions of dollars or millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars 300 times more than their regular employees they create business deals that fucking incinerate overnight and go nowhere and then the entire rest of the company suffers
3429451	3430052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3445952	3448595	I am, and I'm actually really pleased to see this.
3449576	3462509	So FromSoftware's president, Miyazaki Hidetaka, was basically putting out that he's not going to let the same sorts of shutdowns and layoffs happen.
3463030	3467695	Of course, this is the studio that did Elden Rings and Dark Souls games and stuff like that.
3470191	3498739	but it's it's been you know a rough ride I think for every company but one of the things that he was going on in fact I'll just read the quote speaking to myself in this company I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at From Software in a million years I'm pretty sure our parent company Kadokawa understands that and shares that view Kadokawa by the way is a publishing company is very very prolific
3502058	3521248	but the company has actually been growing during all this time since working on Elden Ring they've got the Armored Core 6, Elden Ring just had a huge DLC comes out but Miyazaki actually brings up Iwata talking about the layoffs
3522529	3523369	I'll read the quote again.
3523810	3531078	I think it was the old ex-president of Nintendo, Iwata-san, who said that people who are afraid of losing their jobs are afraid of making good things.
3531618	3534021	I'm paraphrasing that, but I totally share this view.
3535182	3538145	I think the people at Kadokawa, our parent company, understand that.
3538245	3539427	I hold this view very strongly.
3541819	3553938	They're saying that they don't know 100% for sure what's going to happen, but his vow is to keep his employees' jobs safe so that they can continue working at their best.
3555579	3565701	What a difference in perspective though, you know, and especially, you know, invoking Iwata and just what a hugely respected businessman in the industry he was.
3565781	3573923	And yeah, Ranmari in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network reminding us, you know, when Nintendo was going through financial roughness, Iwata cut his own salary.
3574023	3574443	True.
3574823	3579744	And that's always that standard, you know, when the Wii U was struggling, that is 100% true, that happened.
3580244	3581905	And that's why a lot of us...
3582745	3606091	that's how it should be and when we look at a lot of these other CEOs out there who don't do the same thing or the disgusting pig Bobby Kotick getting a huge payout to leave Activision as a fucking reward to be quite honest it's disgusting it's disgusting and you wonder why people don't want to pay $70 for a game who's pocketing that money
3607489	3610051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3626562	3651808	where it's like no you you you have to like if a person is always afraid of their job being on the line they're not going to take creative risks and creative risks are where the greatest games come from right you know and FromSoftware is in a great place right now happy Elden Ring expansion week to those who celebrate including my husband who you know got got got on that bandwagon this week so there's a lot of people really excited about that Elden Ring expansion
3652267	3662270	I'll put this out, and I believe this, and it's kind of a tenet where I work, that without innovation, you have stagnation.
3662491	3670433	When nothing changes, nothing gets better, and if you don't change to adapt to what's around you, then you're going to fail.
3671554	3675215	And sometimes, you have to be the one to affect the change.
3676775	3681029	which again, innovate, change the narrative, bring out something new.
3681069	3683476	You don't have to reinvent the wheel to innovate on it.
3685063	3710169	so by the way when we're talking about $70 games and some perspective here that Elden Ring Shadow of the Erd Tree DLC is $40 now that is on the high end of DLC costs but everything I'm hearing about it is that it is basically like an like it's it's basically a full game like it is like like it's not just like DLC like ooh bonus chapter or bonus it is like another fucking game within Elden Ring
3710789	3733176	Like when we got the Citadel DLC back in the day, it was like adding a whole extra part to the game Yeah, but even more than that from what I understand this is Like an MMO expansion, I think may be a really good way, like a Wrath of the Lich King or Endwalker type of situation, sounds like that Yeah
3735171	3736933	All right, let's move on.
3737313	3746001	Maybe now, even though we show a little love to the Japanese companies here, maybe there are other decisions that don't always make sense.
3746121	3746622	Yes, Loki?
3749047	3756109	Yeah, so Nintendo is coming after people again for IP theft or whatever.
3757130	3763491	But this time, now they're actually coming after YouTube channels that have created sheet music of Nintendo tracks.
3763751	3775755	So Sheet Music Boss and Purple Shala have been informed by their respective community that Nintendo has begun targeting sheet music sites like Music Notes and TakingMusicDown.com
3776275	3778996	for games like Pokemon Mario and The Legend of Zelda.
3779996	3784738	They say that Music Notes is actively trying to get this decision reversed.
3784838	3792300	Sheet Music Boss says their arrangements have been correctly licensed and that the original artists were receiving royalties for their sheet music.
3793080	3799982	We're working on it, but it's super frustrating, especially given that so many Nintendo pieces aren't available anywhere as sheets.
3800643	3804524	Sorry for anyone that's affected, but please know it's totally out of our control.
3807200	3823105	it depends on how the composer of the music was contracted to do it but with a lot of cases any sort of art or asset that is produced while under the employ of another company is the property of the company um
3826080	3831966	In the case of a contractor, it would have to be something in their class.
3832026	3839373	If I were to say go work for Sega and do a logo for them, that logo doesn't belong to me even though it's my work.
3839893	3842516	I can put it in my portfolio, but Sega would own that work.
3844741	3851286	Well, I think there's a lot of cooks in the kitchens of this stuff, too, because I'm sure Nintendo doesn't handle a lot of this stuff internally.
3851366	3856911	They probably contract with somebody else to handle all the music licensing stuff, and that's who these companies are kind of claiming to go through.
3858352	3861655	But at the end of the day, all that stuff aside, it's just not a good look.
3862255	3863356	It's just not a good look.
3863516	3864477	But do they care?
3864957	3865758	No, they don't.
3865778	3868580	It's one of those things where you go, were they legally within their right?
3868760	3872784	Well, actually, the question I would really ask, and surely somebody's asked this question.
3872844	3873184	Surely.
3873224	3873865	I'm not the first.
3874545	3876866	Was it actually Nintendo that did the cease and desist?
3876906	3879488	Because we know that that shit has been happening on YouTube.
3880068	3883230	That people that aren't actually the companies have been putting out claims.
3883270	3886792	There's a whole other like seedy shit thing that's going on YouTube.
3887132	3893316	But like that would be the first question I would ask is are we sure it was actually Nintendo that sent this?
3893896	3899879	Or their authorized license grant or whatever it's called legally.
3900200	3900940	Their solicitor.
3901140	3902001	They have a solicitor.
3902021	3902101	Yes.
3903914	3905055	Was it really from them?
3905275	3907116	That's the first question I would honestly ask.
3909138	3916602	But if it was, then it just seems desperate for a company that doesn't need to be desperate.
3917863	3918144	Right?
3918264	3923127	Like if my little symphony wants to play music from Fire Emblem...
3924844	3926045	Don't you have to pay for the license?
3949548	3961617	that's one thing but I'm wondering if I haven't used these sites I mean I might have peeked at one to get an idea for doing a MIDI track once but it depends on if
3963152	3969833	These sites let independent users also upload their own versions of things.
3970533	3973734	So in that case, it would be unlicensed media.
3973754	3977234	There's a lot of weirdness that goes on with those kind of legalities.
3977414	3978335	And we're not lawyers.
3978715	3979635	Disclaimer, disclaimer.
3980795	3991917	But I'm wondering if there are other circumstances that we coming into this are not seeing.
3992927	3994649	because they don't have to give us the full story.
3994769	3999874	And a lot of times information is put out there for our consumption so that we'll consume it in a particular manner.
4000294	4000835	That's true.
4001555	4003958	If you're not watching Untucked, you're only getting half the story.
4007352	4010293	Well, that's like a legit comparison here.
4010413	4011173	Like, you're right.
4011293	4016876	Maybe there is part of the story we don't see, which is often the case in these types of situations.
4017376	4028960	But I think this comes back to an adage that I've put out there on the show before about in gaming, what is often the truth doesn't matter.
4029560	4033742	And I know that's a very tough pill to swallow, but the truth doesn't matter.
4034602	4038664	What is perceived is always going to be the thing that drives gamers.
4039684	4040305	All of the time.
4041185	4042205	It can do with anybody.
4042526	4044446	Everyone's going to make their own judgments.
4046087	4053330	And honestly enough, it's what I think a lot of news outlets rely on.
4054011	4054311	Mm-hmm.
4055772	4061656	and that's why we have a lot of the problems we do because people do not do their own fucking research and they make a snap judgment at the end.
4061716	4062556	That's human nature.
4063037	4064798	Thank God my brain's not wired that way.
4065118	4069501	I could not imagine existing in that kind of mental state.
4070387	4097129	But at the end There was such a good TikTok floating around this week of Jon Stewart I mean, really, it was just a clip from The Daily Show Jon Stewart is I happened to see it on TikTok And he really nailed this whole thing about how the media just doesn't fucking hold anybody accountable, including itself Yeah Yeah I mean, even, like, I've even started losing some faith in the BBC Because they used to just be the dry British fact news
4098464	4098584	No.
4099145	4101047	But anyway, that goes back to this, though.
4101147	4102930	Moving on to talk about the weather today.
4102990	4104452	It's going to be quite golem out.
4106895	4110880	Golem is going to be our new thing for sickly, poorly things.
4112021	4112522	But, um...
4113278	4127302	The reason why I was bringing that up is that I think that we also, as people, we tend to look at the first things and give our reactions to things, but I don't know.
4127342	4134803	I just wonder if there is something else under the surface of this that we don't know.
4134943	4137924	What is it that's motivating Nintendo to do this?
4138324	4140965	Maybe they're planning on publishing their sheet music themselves.
4142631	4143452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4160732	4183652	I mean to be fair and Bobby went over this on his show too and he said it in chat is that this particular site was paying compositional licenses to whoever that entity was so technically even if a book was coming there was that payment so it was it was legal on that end but that is that is a very interesting perspective on what could the other half of the story be right exactly exactly and that's just what I wanted to have people think about too is that
4184332	4185674	Just what we see on the surface.
4185814	4193885	And I mean, we know fact is fact, you know, legally, they don't really have a foot to stand on unless there's something else going on here that's not obvious to us.
4196289	4196609	All right.
4197070	4199854	Well, moving on, you know, this this can just be a scare tactic.
4200680	4206522	This is somewhat in a way in a similar wavelength of this story, even though it's about a very different topic.
4206562	4209964	I think this is very much like what is the perception that this leaves out there?
4210204	4211864	What is going on now?
4212004	4223049	This does get into rumor and alleged territory, but it is, again, one of those things where based on, you know, we are able to emotionally jump to this conclusion based on what we are seeing.
4223709	4227912	What I'm talking about is the PlayStation VR 2 and what's going on there.
4229213	4232615	We know we haven't seen a lot of first-party games for the PlayStation VR 2.
4232695	4236318	We've seen a lot of reliance on third parties and all that going on.
4238299	4247666	Android Central is a website that has reported, of course, anonymous sources, that Sony has cut funding for VR game development and there are only...
4249206	4253467	There are only two projects currently in development at Sony for this.
4254228	4255108	We don't know what the games are.
4255128	4257248	There's no details on what those projects are.
4257708	4269511	But it does sort of say something, especially when you kind of put that next to Sony putting out that device that opens it up as a PC headset at this point and all that stuff that Sony's just kind of ready to move on.
4271932	4277736	Like, you know, I don't know what these two games are supposed to be, if they're Hail Marys or what, but Sony's kinda done.
4278217	4279918	Loki, you look like you're dying to say something.
4280599	4298732	Well, I was just saying, like, this is typical Sony, like, with any of these, like, new, like, Vita and the original PlayStation VR, although I think they support the original PlayStation VR a little bit more, but, yeah, I mean, it's just... Why create these devices if you're not gonna support them?
4299393	4299573	I mean...
4300307	4303593	Funny enough, this report came from Android Central.
4303853	4309484	Google, another perfect example of a company that creates things that they then don't support.
4310405	4310545	So...
4312133	4320019	Now, it should be pointed out, if you are a VR enthusiast or you're a PSVR2 owner who's frowning right now, there are things happening in the third-party space, right?
4320140	4322802	Alien Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening.
4323782	4329227	But, you know, it's got to be disappointing to an extent to hear that Sony is kind of cutting back.
4329687	4337594	You know, again, I'd be curious what those two games are, if they're putting the weight of a AAA franchise, but, like, actually meaning it.
4338634	4351685	There was a cute little Horizon, because I know the one time I played the PSVR 2 at Bobby's house, he had a Horizon minigame thing that actually was a pretty neat proof of concept for the sound all around you.
4352325	4354107	It did a lot of the VR tricks very cool.
4354127	4354727	It was a neat thing.
4355108	4367558	But it wasn't really like a start-to-finish narrative experience type of thing that I think people sort of long for in VR with the first party weight behind it.
4370799	4373080	It's weird to think that that's ever going to happen at this point.
4378582	4381763	Bobby says, I mean, I didn't put you in the start to finish experience.
4382163	4383484	I put you in the Disney ride.
4384224	4385825	Okay, then let me flip that around.
4386285	4394908	Do you believe that the full game was as good as a Horizon Forbidden West or Horizon Zero Dawn?
4397864	4403810	because when I look at some of these other PSVR spinoff games, even on the one, they were a little different.
4403870	4405352	Okay, Bobby says, no, I do not.
4405792	4407394	So there is that.
4408527	4411428	DarkSakura, what did the internet find this week?
4436734	4439510	I myself am strange and unusual.
4441257	4445698	So, what has been thought forever lost has been found.
4446238	4452720	There was a really, really bad, devious, all-CG movie that was done in 2002.
4453280	4459201	It, like, had a single play, I think it was like 75 minutes, and it played during a summer roadshow.
4460722	4466303	And then it never was released for home media, which had been planned, and it hasn't been rebroadcast since.
4467603	4470924	The trailer for it has resurfaced, you know.
4472598	4496421	and uh it's uh it looked as bad as I thought it was going to look I mean the CG is definitely dated but um but it was done by Groove Corporation and apparently this is uh at least according to Lost Media Wiki the head of Groove Corporation stole the company's cash in the master tapes
4497795	4505683	and that basically led the company to go out of business and there are of course no masters to make the copies off of.
4507065	4507305	Wow.
4508106	4509808	But even the trailer was really bad.
4509828	4509988	Like...
4513809	4521977	Yeah, but it was the trailer that was released for a short run in 2002.
4522037	4524019	There's no more of this.
4524779	4530345	And the person who uploaded it to YouTube is R&D Stranger.
4532343	4559729	but the quote on this is this is the trailer for the Xevious CGI animated movie that was released to Japanese theaters for only a short run in 2002 after the run was finished the movie was never released again only a clip about 5 seconds long existed online before this however I found a promotional preview CD that included trailers for several animated short films including Xevious so here is the trailer from that CD
4561488	4570057	and then something in 2020, Bandai Namco Studios had a snippet of the movie in the Namco Museum of Art series.
4571919	4575102	So yeah, that's it.
4575302	4575702	It's gone.
4577296	4581420	Maybe that dude will turn up and say, hey, here's those tapes, by the way.
4581641	4582461	I didn't, you know.
4582782	4588048	Or someone will find like, you know, oh, what is this master tape I found on eBay for $3?
4588708	4590971	Oh my god, it's a really awful Xevious movie.
4592072	4613193	yeah this is what like as much as I believe you know all art to an extent should be preserved um this isn't a hill worth dying on like this this one we can let go uh it's it's really okay if this never sees light a day uh we'll move on with our lives we really will uh because it looked really bad all right
4614562	4621829	Anyhow, plus when I think about video game movies that need to be made, like Xevious, not even in the top 100, to be honest.
4623511	4623811	All right.
4624652	4625793	It must have been cheap to license.
4625873	4626133	All right.
4626574	4627515	Moving on, Loki.
4629256	4629537	All right.
4630477	4635562	Well, we've got some possible leaks of time splitters coming to the PlayStation platform.
4636365	4645427	because in Korea, or I should say Taiwan, the ratings board has rated TimeSplitters for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
4646547	4648087	Now, I don't think this is a new game.
4648267	4658549	The thought is that it's going to be the PlayStation 2 game as part of the PlayStation Plus catalog, which is less exciting, but cool, I guess.
4658569	4658949	Much less exciting.
4658969	4659729	At least it's coming out.
4660549	4661489	Yeah.
4661769	4664410	I want my new TimeSplitters game, please.
4666158	4667059	All these promises.
4669661	4671662	Maybe... I'm sure this is Embracer's fault.
4672222	4673543	Yes, we'll just blame Embracer.
4673603	4674083	Great idea.
4675945	4682529	All right, let's move on and talk about one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.
4682649	4689733	This has to do, unfortunately, with a studio that shut down, but it's an interesting sort of story about how...
4690774	4692215	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4707307	4708288	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4730683	4731143	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4759881	4763365	So wherever he ended up, he's probably doing A-OK.
4764145	4768109	It'll just be a question of how many of his former studio employees was he able to bring with him.
4768690	4775377	Hopefully a lot, but we'll see over the next few weeks and months, really, as that news develops.
4776498	4780642	All right, let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment.
4782043	4782624	Let's roll the bumper.
4793351	4795572	The Classic Game of the Week is Child of Light.
4819266	4829953	on purpose picked something that came out as close to the edge of that 10 year gap that I could find wait till you see what I do in November
4832225	4848049	Anyway, Child of Light is a platforming RPG that was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and it was published by Ubisoft for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in April of 2014.
4848769	4856491	It came out on the PlayStation Vita in July 2014 and later was released on Switch on October 11, 2018.
4859313	4860673	We'll be going into more on this.
4861374	4863075	You can play it on all sorts of things.
4863155	4865497	It's actually available on Luna.
4865577	4866618	It was on Stadia.
4868399	4869360	Rest in peace, Stadia.
4870921	4875664	And it's actually run on the UbiArt Framework game engine.
4875844	4877645	This game is fucking beautiful, okay?
4878586	4879186	Like, look at it.
4879447	4879987	Look at it.
4880567	4881488	It lives through her life.
4881768	4888353	And if y'all are listening elsewhere, pull over to the side of the road, pull out your YouTube app, and look at it.
4889775	4890195	Just saying.
4891257	4911579	Anyway, the game, it takes place in this land called Lemuria, and you play as Aurora, who is a child who wakes up after dying from an illness and has to bring back the sun, the moon, and the stars that are being held by the Queen of Night so that she can go home.
4913408	4935909	um the way that you play is it's got some definitely side scrolling platforming elements to it and it's a little flying around here a little puzzle solving there and different role play elements so you have like turn-based combat like the active uh battle systems and some of our favorite RPGs like the Final Fantasy series or Grandia
4937410	4959802	you can control up to two characters during a battle and you can swap them out with waiting characters and you get up to three enemies that happen during the battle and if you approach them from behind you get a surprise strike and if they get you from behind it's an ambush and you also have a
4961221	4986529	another character called Igniculus who is a firefly and is used as a mechanic inside and during the battles I'm sorry, outside and during the battles and then you can move them around to open chests and shine light on an enemy to slow them down or to heal you just like your little supporting it's like Navi, it's your supporting Navi Hey, Houston!
4989030	5011751	um without being that annoying so um but Aurora is a princess and after being stranded in Lemuria uh she runs into a uh a jester called Rubella who has a vocabulary problem and then Finn who is a sorcerer and just all kinds of fun characters so um
5013968	5030872	as it stands though the game visually is just this really really pretty pretty thing the backgrounds look like watercolor paintings um or at the very least like really nice gouache um
5032780	5044271	and just it's so it makes me think honestly I don't know why but I get a vibe in the art style resembling like the little prince illustrations you know I see that
5048424	5071116	Anyway, it was initially shown at GDC Europe 2013 and it was said that it was inspired by Studio Ghibli and my art hero, Yoshitaka Amano and presented those other sort of paint-like games like Limbo and
5073098	5076620	and I think it's absolutely beautiful.
5078161	5084805	They wanted Aurora to grow throughout the game going from five years old to 10 to 15 and finish when she was around 20 years old.
5085305	5090948	So you could see her physically evolve and then along with her personality.
5092349	5095731	And then of course all of her relationships and her perspective would change.
5096871	5121449	it would have had multiple endings where you would decide the ending that you want but she only ages once in the game and there's one ending and then now this I like is that they had talked about her having like a prince in the story but they wanted her to be someone who did not rely on a man or fall in love at the end of the story and this is real girl boss power just saying
5124107	5140628	and that oh god, something else I totally agree with the writer Jeffrey Yohalem says that love is an easy way out for a writer that instead of focusing on
5141989	5156092	Growing up or using your time to help others or just being an adult or doing things on your own, that it's a cop-out to have them instead just be a romance story.
5156452	5160253	I mean, there's a lot of good stories that are ruined by romance.
5160493	5160733	Anyway.
5163134	5166615	And Aurora is actually...
5169005	5178311	Supposedly from Austria, sorry, 1895, Austria, the child of a duke.
5178911	5189918	And it's stated that the lands are supposed to be in Carniola and that there's an earthquake that hit the capital on Easter Sunday.
5190719	5193881	And so that's what was incorporated into the game.
5194915	5218417	that there's like a flood going on from a dam bursting and so it's uh lots of stuff going on there's lots of stuff behind it um it's like I mentioned before it's using the UbiArt framework engine that was also used for Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends so they could uh put concept art into the game and make it look like an animated painting um
5219508	5235038	they gave it a watercolor effect because they wanted it to look like an underwater dream and that some of the staff had their kids draw Aurora based on the description that they were given and they
5236030	5263497	yeah, they took it that design so at any rate it's also been described as a playable poem with the game's dialogue being done in rhyme and ballad form so four line stanza with the second and fourth ending in rhyming words with some variable iambic counts so basically it's like you're listening to a sonnet every time you hear them talk um
5265518	5276691	and that the artwork was inspired by, of course, like I said earlier, Amano, also Arthur Rackman, John Bauer, Edmund Duloc.
5279486	5298478	and it was also released in Europe with an exclusive poster that came with the deluxe versions of the games for Windows, PS3 and PS4 Ubisoft also worked with Cirque du Soleil during the development of the game and that provided the theatrical feel and the costume designs
5299538	5308821	The music was composed by Beatrice Martin, also known as Croix de Pirate.
5309001	5310261	How do you say pirate in French?
5310681	5312022	It's the heart of the pirate.
5312762	5316923	Who is a Canadian singer and songwriter, clearly Quebecois.
5318603	5331609	and also worked with the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra recording the songs and her music was described as fresh, romantic and optimistic and embodied the feeling of Child of Light.
5332833	5335595	So, it received mostly positive reviews.
5335655	5340760	The PS3 version from Metacritic had an 89 of 100, Switch 84 of 100, and Wii U 84 of 100, and PlayStation 4 82 of 100.
5340820	5342942	Xbox One 82 of 100, Xbox 360 74 of 100, and the PC version a 77 of 100.
5342982	5343162	So, yeah.
5343182	5343542	Average and up.
5343582	5343942	Um... There, uh...
5357995	5376685	or people like Vince Ignacio of IGN said the combat system was second to none but that sometimes the rhyming scheme kept it kept one from being able to really get into the meat of the characters
5380203	5391894	but everyone praised the feeling and the music and just the art style in general of the game and said that it was very refreshing to have that kind of game.
5391994	5397899	Now, Alex Navarro of Giant Bomb was a lot more critical and he said that
5399341	5408351	While the game is pretty, it didn't leave a lasting impact and the narrative seemed uninspired because it relied on childhood stories.
5408652	5413257	You know, that sort of motif of the evil stepmother and magical kingdoms and all of that.
5415059	5417482	And it made it hard to understand the plot.
5418787	5436658	and then there were people who just thought it wasn't hard enough but that there are still plenty of other people who thought it was an absolutely delightful game and at the 18th annual DICE Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences nominated it for the Handheld Game of the Year.
5437979	5442703	So, there were other things that came with it, other media.
5442843	5451410	April 30, 2015, Ubisoft released a digital book for free called Child of Light, Reginald the Great, for the first anniversary.
5451890	5454192	It was also written by the game's writer.
5454912	5455232	And then...
5458056	5469029	An illustrator named Serge Marinho was involved in a new book set in the Child of Life universe.
5470991	5476498	And they had two other books already written and a third planned, but nothing was released.
5476598	5477158	No further books.
5479020	5490507	There was also October 2018, Tasha Huo was working on a pilot for a TV show from Child of Light as a big fan of the game.
5491767	5500493	And then on March 31st, 2022, Aurora was made as a playable character for Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.
5503448	5530467	so there's been stated that they wanted to do more with Child of Light and in fact there was when they were talking about the Switch release is that there had been teased a sequel for Child of Light 2 but we haven't seen anything there's also talk of a prequel we haven't seen anything but this was supposed to take inspiration from Swan Lake
5531303	5535745	and still have the watercolor themed art and more operatic and slightly more adult.
5536685	5540266	But we still haven't seen anything and it would be nice if we did.
5543807	5557072	Oh, actually there is another note is that because Ubisoft's business model has changed, Plur does not think that there is going to be the prequel release because that's not the kind of game Ubisoft is looking to make now.
5559778	5560198	And that's it.
5560779	5561319	Child of Light.
5561940	5565923	Well, thank you for that classic Game of the Week pick, even if most of us are sitting here going, really?
5565983	5567705	This game is 10 years old now, huh?
5568025	5568385	Okay.
5568685	5569866	All right.
5569926	5571007	That leaves me with a feeling.
5572789	5582417	Phil of Nine in our chat mentions, I remember when this came out and how much it stood out from other games because of the beautiful style.
5582497	5583437	Yeah, I agree with that.
5583918	5587281	And specifically, quite honestly, other Ubisoft games.
5588381	5601488	It was nice to see a big company like Ubisoft making games like this, which is why I let out the deep sigh I just did with that last comment about how Ubisoft doesn't make games like this anymore when this was just 10 years ago.
5602629	5603669	It's disappointing.
5603709	5609012	I mean, that has to go back to what we were talking about earlier for taking risks and innovating.
5609993	5612654	And the designers did take a risk.
5612754	5613274	They did...
5615561	5623167	married a couple of different genre together to create something this beautiful and a game that people still remember with fondness.
5623467	5623647	Yeah.
5625108	5625328	All right.
5625368	5626249	Well, thank you for the pick.
5626309	5627630	There it is one more time.
5627690	5634936	Child of Light from Ubisoft on PlayStation 3 and a variety of consoles of its time.
5635856	5636076	Yes.
5636236	5636777	Boy, oh boy.
5638410	5638670	All right.
5639150	5641151	Well, we are going to move on.
5641291	5648274	We have some more segments for you here on tonight's OLR, including some rapid fire news and where we cover some other headlines from the industry.
5648654	5649714	We're going to start with Loki.
5650755	5653236	Talk about movie news, video game movie news.
5653396	5657437	So we've got the announcement from Miyamoto that, hey, guess what?
5657497	5661919	Successful animated Mario movie has gained successful animated Mario sequel, right?
5662699	5665840	That's now set for Japanese release of April 24th, 2026.
5668186	5669587	A couple more years away for that.
5670567	5672048	And then... I hope Birdo's in it.
5672148	5672508	That's all.
5674850	5686876	And then the sequel for a movie I didn't think really should have gotten a sequel, but the 2022 Uncharted... Hollywood can't make games like Child of Light either.
5686976	5691679	Hollywood has to just cash in established franchises because that's all that gets greenlit now.
5691719	5691819	Well...
5692179	5694080	Why can't they make video games?
5694140	5696142	I mean, we see that that was done.
5696762	5701005	We had just some announcements of a movie studio making a video game studio and then making games.
5701185	5705648	I know, but this is why are they going back to Undertale?
5705668	5707709	Why are they going back to Uncharted?
5707910	5708470	Uncharted?
5709070	5712513	I mean, because you can do a generic action movie and people like that kind of stuff.
5712573	5719377	So anyways, sequel for Uncharted, the 2022 movie, it has been announced.
5719998	5721619	It was mentioned in Sony
5722620	5727366	and their Cine Europe announcement talking about their pipeline in upcoming movies.
5727506	5729449	So it is a thing that's in production.
5731772	5732092	Neat.
5733594	5734055	DarkSakura.
5737173	5744216	A game that was revealed in 2004, so we're going to go back 20 years, finally got released.
5746357	5749898	It's called Age of Pirates Captain Blood.
5750679	5755541	And it is a runaround hack and slash...
5756553	5756993	Beat Em Up
5773299	5799640	which tried to make it like a God of War game and it was finished in 2009 but Playlogic who was the previous publisher got into a big legal shebang with over the IP and so even though they'd already been printing discs and preparing them to ship it never actually launched there was a trailer in 2010 that promised a 2011 release and that didn't happen and then BAM
5800606	5816606	June 17th there's a revealed a new world premiere trailer and it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Switch, and PC so yeah it looks it looks like it could be fun it's it's you know Bastion with Pirates everything's better with Pirates
5819087	5825631	Speaking of pirates, a really popular app on the iPhone right now is Delta, which of course is an emulator.
5834437	5835438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5853172	5863140	I got rid of it when it stopped working on Xbox because for whatever reason there was a client for Xbox One that they never brought over to Series X. It might be there now, but it never did.
5863180	5867164	So I canceled because I was like, if they're not going to have it on the newest Xbox, forget it.
5867664	5871547	But it's available on, of course, PC Windows.
5872168	5874730	It is also now going to be available on iPhone.
5875630	5878553	It's going to be coming out on iOS on June 27th, I suppose.
5878593	5878773	Yeah.
5879994	5880795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5899127	5924760	it even gets some random licenses like some PS1 games but they're not like you know you think like Hogs of War and things you probably actually didn't play on PlayStation unless maybe you were in Europe where Anstream is based anyway you can see more about Anstream's library over at anstream.com slash games and it is a streaming platform so you don't actually download the ROMs or anything like that but that's also you know that can be a positive and a negative so yeah
5925860	5935771	AntStream is usually $5 a month or $40 for a year, but apparently the introductory price is going to be $4 a month or $30 a year.
5935851	5938794	Again, if you want more information, AntStream.com.
5939695	5942578	One of these days I should re-up and see what they're up to over there these days.
5945865	5969231	but yeah it is very Eurocentric but I think that's you know what I think that's great that this is available now for more people you know especially when it's emulation in a way that the creators of the original games get a little coin hopefully so all right let's move on and check out some release dates of games coming out around the world starting with the US Loki
5971089	5974251	Yep, so we've got actually quite a few things coming out this week.
5974371	5979714	So starting off, Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition.
5980994	5986437	That's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5987398	5996883	Frogan Encore, we've got on PC, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5998015	6024830	Graven on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Riven on PC and Mac Yes, that's right, Riven is coming out again Not a surprise Super Monkey Ball, Banana Rumble on Nintendo Switch Until then, on PC and PlayStation 5 We've got Luigi's Mansion 2 HD on Nintendo Switch
6026937	6049834	and uh let's see Nero uh Neo Sprint on a PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series and Atari VCS um uh Chia I guess that's how you pronounce that on Nintendo Switch um
6051397	6062964	Tsukihime, a piece of blue glass moon on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6063925	6071510	And then we have Spy x Anya Operation Memories on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6073137	6082585	All right, and I'm going to get to Japanese releases, but I was curious on this AntStream thing because somebody dropped a link in chat that showed all the games that you can play on the AntStream collection.
6082605	6090291	I just do want to clarify for our listeners that, yes, Yars' Revenge is playable on AntStream.
6090451	6095195	So if you need another way to play Yars' Revenge in your collection...
6096354	6096654	Lord.
6097094	6098235	AntStream's got you handled.
6099496	6100396	Just so we're clear.
6100416	6100916	Worried about that.
6102357	6102757	Yeah, I know.
6102777	6105299	I was a little worried about it too, but we're A-OK.
6105379	6105759	Good news.
6106179	6108880	Alright, let's travel Japan and check out the releases over there.
6109681	6114923	Over in Japan, on the Nintendo Switch this next week, we have Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, of course.
6114963	6116844	We'll be making its way out there as well.
6117585	6121387	Arcana Alchemia is also out in a regular and a limited edition.
6121967	6123228	A Street Cat's Tale...
6123948	6126890	Appropriately, the Neko Neko Edition is out as well.
6128211	6130752	Coming out on the Switch as well.
6132013	6135555	Iwakura Aria is also out in a regular and limited edition.
6136035	6139417	The Night Witch in a, you guessed it, regular and limited edition.
6140558	6148283	Neptunia vs. Titan Dogu, not like D-O-G-U-U, Dogu, is out as well.
6148903	6153546	And you know I love Muv-Luv, and Muv-Luv Alternative Remastered Double Pack is
6154586	6160708	I guess it's two Muv-Luv games coming out together also on the 27th of June in Japan.
6161249	6165290	There's also a game, I think this is interesting, Rise Zap for Nintendo Switch.
6165430	6167091	It's called Rhythm Training.
6167531	6171532	And so I was kind of looking at it going, oh, is this like a DDR type of thing?
6171552	6181335	But it looks like it's more like maybe boxing, like this type of rhythm thing because the screenshots kind of look like punching and that whole type of thing where you have a blue hand and a red hand, I guess, to go with the controls.
6181395	6182956	So that's kind of interesting, I guess.
6183396	6185620	What about an Ultra Hand?
6185780	6186401	To be determined.
6187910	6197672	On the PlayStation 5, meanwhile, we have Spy x Anya Operation Memories is out in Japan, which is called Spy x Family in other regions.
6197712	6204514	But that Spy x Anya Operation Memories is out on June 27th, as is Deep Rock Galactic Special Edition.
6204894	6208975	That same Neptunia vs Titan Doogoo is out as well.
6210035	6211275	And that's it for the PlayStation 5.
6212236	6213296	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
6214440	6218971	We have on the 25th for PlayStation we have Monster Hunter Stories Collection.
6219741	6247008	for Switch we have Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble on the 27th for Switch we have Chaya Oletti Edition also on the 27th for PlayStation and Xbox we have Black Sad Under the Skin for Switch we have Luigi's Mansion 2 HD and Citizen Sleeper sorry that's the 28th sorry Citizen Sleeper also on the 28th is Dave the Diver for Switch also on Switch is Maze Mystery The Secret of Dragonville

Parents Garden Simulator Ultra Mega Extra Party Challenge and Spy Cross Anya Operation Memories and then for PlayStation and Switch on that day we have 34 Sports Games World Edition
6280939	6281159	Hello?
6281179	6284503	I think he's muted.
6285224	6285925	Oh, hi Rob.
6286065	6287947	Oh, hi, sorry, I am muted, you're right.
6288768	6289088	My bad.
6289469	6297618	I was going to say, it's a pretty busy week for releases, and I wanted to get on to our next story on one of those releases Loki was talking about.
6299079	6301620	Yep, this is silly.
6302260	6312664	Ubisoft had tweeted that the remaster, of course, of Beyond Good and Evil was coming June 25th on their official Twitter account.
6313804	6315385	But they have deleted the tweet.
6317625	6319926	It's not ready yet to announce.
6320546	6320846	How?
6321967	6322607	I don't know.
6322787	6327729	But then, of course, there is already a trailer that's out for it.
6327889	6328229	I mean...
6330152	6349064	it's it's common right then people played it remember it leaked on Ubisoft plus it's like they they just can't keep this a secret for whatever reason well especially you would think there'd be a little more hype behind it too with just a few days to go right we don't hype anything yeah
6350893	6359759	Well, I don't know how much people are hyping this, but for better or for worse, one of the biggest memes in gaming, and you can look up the memes for yourself.
6359899	6366443	I'm not going to explain it to you, but it was a classic video game, MMO-ish experience called Habbo Hotel.
6367104	6367624	Oh, God.
6369025	6370727	Haba Hotel Origins Haba Hotel Origins
6384443	6386244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6408739	6411621	Your avatar would chat with friends in a virtual hotel lobby.
6411981	6416524	You could spend credits on furniture and accessories and decorate your guest room and all that good stuff.
6417324	6419445	There's two other whole versions on the site as well.
6419806	6430992	Yeah, Mackelby is the creator of this and I guess just kind of came across the files saying after discovering an old decrepit server with some long lost files at the beginning of this year.
6431472	6440301	Over the past six months or so, longtime Habbo developer and player McElbee has lovingly restored an old version of Habbo Hotel first released in 2005.
6440621	6446347	They're saying this new version will have a fresh community-led approach.
6447208	6458096	Meaning that the Info Bus Park, which was an area in the original game, is now a democratic forum where they will answer player questions about the development and direction of the game.
6459097	6464442	That was originally a waiting area for players to board the bus, which only ran for a few hours a day.
6465482	6473309	Also, now you may only make an account if you are 18 years of age or higher, not 13, because again, the original game
6475737	6476317	End of sentence.
6477759	6478939	That's all I need to say about it.
6479100	6480941	What if we all signed up and made it Woken Gay?
6481882	6492249	Well, you know, you would hope that maybe with the Democratic Forum and all this stuff, maybe, you know, maybe everybody's grown the fuck up in the last 20 years and maybe this new version will be Woken Gay.
6492590	6498134	But let me just say, I don't... Yeah, I'm with Loki on where I predict... I don't think it's Democratic in the sense of Democratic Party.
6498274	6499195	Yeah.
6499275	6499795	Well, yeah.
6499895	6501076	But I'm... Yeah.
6501957	6502157	So...
6503758	6506261	All of you making pool jokes in chat are banned.
6506461	6507883	Just, I'm getting out my hammer.
6508284	6511668	Banned, but you get a ban and you get a ban and you get a ban.
6512188	6512489	All right.
6512869	6519077	Look, I actually questioned if I want to bring it up or not, but I think you have to go.
6519737	6520618	Here's the thing too.
6520799	6521660	Think of it this way.
6523180	6528743	All the people that participated in those types of events were probably 17 or 18 at the time.
6529583	6532645	Those same people are 37 and 38 now.
6533566	6533886	Okay?
6534646	6548974	So if us talking about Child of Light made you feel old, how old do you think some of those people who participated in such tomfoolery are feeling now with this re-release of this game?
6550191	6563984	anyway Ranmari in chat says if I do return to Habbo Hotel I am going to instead shout trans rights at the pool as one should do you should just shout trans rights at a real pool
6565595	6566036	Why not?
6566096	6566256	Why not?
6566716	6570801	Actually, there was an emote in Diablo 4 that I unlocked on my character.
6570881	6582694	When the character does the emote, I swear, I swear the sprinkles, little stardust that he leaves behind, I swear to God, they're in the colors of very light blue, white, and pink.
6583155	6584717	Where else do we see those colors together?
6586274	6586974	The trans flag.
6587714	6591475	So I'm almost positive Diablo has a trans right emote in the game.
6591495	6592555	That's what I'm calling it anyway.
6593055	6594356	So, all right.
6595416	6596236	Happy pride, by the way.
6596996	6602638	Let's move on to the listener round table and invite your feedback as we do every week.
6602978	6608119	You can join our green room if you're feeling like it over at our vognetwork.com slash discord.
6608379	6611500	You could also just join our discord server to say hi to us throughout the week.
6612360	6612680	You can...
6613860	6617283	We have a whole channel dedicated to when celebrities pass away.
6618083	6621526	Tiger Claw will make a post about it and you can have your moment of awe.
6621546	6623988	Kind of like when Donald Sutherland passed away this week, which is sad.
6624028	6625129	I'm not here to make light of it.
6625509	6630934	But he was 88, which he had a good life and it was kind of one of those like, oh, that's too bad.
6631334	6632675	But it takes you a minute to...
6634470	6638272	you know, remember these awesome celebrities that unfortunately we have lost.
6638512	6643714	But trust me, there's much more in the Discord server than just the In Memoriam channel.
6644955	6646756	It's your way to talk with us every week.
6647336	6658201	Alright, but I think we actually have much more talking going on in the mailbag than we're used to over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com What are you doing?
6658221	6659641	Like one person emailed twice.
6659921	6660141	What?
6660382	6663363	I'm sorry, there is a one and a half email limit per week.
6664844	6666705	Well, I'll go ahead and start with the first one.
6666865	6667165	All right.
6667566	6668926	So, hello, LR.
6668966	6678272	Catching up on the June 9th episode of the show, Rob mentions that the PC adapter for the PlayStation VR 2 moves onto his wishlist.
6678292	6678512	Sorry.
6678872	6681293	To be completely honest, I received this news as the opposite.
6681353	6687597	Basically, this one song for the headset is kind of like the PlayStation VR 2 got its R21 patch.
6688017	6689118	Maybe pause for a moment.
6689178	6690879	Does that reference ring a bell with anyone?
6691539	6698503	You may recall all the way back in 2006 that In The Groove 2 was a thing, at least until Konami sued its developers and publisher.
6699004	6705108	Just weeks before the announcement of the settlement would end the series, a patch was released for ITG2 called R21.
6705548	6711432	This patch allowed players to play their own songs and step charts off of USB drives simply by plugging them into the machine.
6712617	6713598	But why, players asked.
6714099	6720065	If we can play any song or chart off USB, doesn't that render new versions pointless?
6720746	6723009	And then the settlement was announced, so we knew why.
6723269	6726533	R21 existed only because the game was no longer commercially viable.
6727173	6730817	There would be no In the Groove 3, so why not sabotage the current version?
6730917	6732880	At least players would get something more out of it.
6733420	6742068	According to an Ars Technica article from back in March, hundreds of thousands of unsold PSVR2 units are sitting in warehouses.
6742649	6750176	Sony needs a way to entice folks to buy the remaining inventory, and they're seemingly reluctant to run discounts on much of anything nowadays.
6750697	6758284	They have announced exactly zero first-party gains coming to the headset over the foreseeable future, and I'd put down a few bucks that no more are coming.
6758684	6764656	Let's face it, outside of plugging a few third-party titles here or there, Sony is fully and completely done with PSVR 2.
6766360	6772945	This is their R21 patch allowing existing owners to get a bit more mileage out of it, perhaps enticing a few more folks to buy one.
6773506	6777108	During people to PC to buy games cuts themselves out.
6777509	6784995	They no longer get the 30% cut that they'd get on the PlayStation Store, which defeats the point of having a walled garden in the first place.
6785475	6789978	There's no financial reason for them to do this unless they're calling it quits, which they are.
6790879	6793881	Personally, I would not recommend buying a PSVR 2 at this point.
6794081	6801926	We've seen that in the past, multi-platform games are designed with the most popular platform in mind, and when it comes to VR, that platform is Oculus Quest.
6802546	6808730	From now onward, almost all of what we're going to see on PSVR 2 are just ports to the game designed for Quest.
6809190	6811471	It's a shame, but Sony basically sent this thing to die.
6812412	6815934	So yeah, too many games this next weekend, April 28th through 30th.
6816274	6816574	Yay!
6816995	6825019	Come visit me and play Super Duper Multitasking, or if you don't want to talk to anyone, you can just watch the 15-minute looping video I'm producing for the booth.
6825279	6826460	Enjoy your week, and YYR.
6827860	6828601	Thanks for the email.
6828821	6831242	And I do remember the R21s, right?
6831342	6835484	DJ Ranma S in chat says the whole R21 thing sounds more like a coincidence than anything else.
6835644	6838706	Nah, that was a Trojan horse.
6838726	6844709	That was absolutely purposeful, but it was a brilliant little device knowing what's coming.
6845629	6847390	So that was an interesting trip down memory lane.
6847430	6850291	It kind of reminds me of the kill switch we all know is lurking in Steam.
6850371	6854453	Someday Steam is going to push a button that unlocks all those games in your library.
6854473	6856074	You don't have to connect online to play them anymore.
6857155	6860916	And we all know it's in the terms and conditions we accept with Steam and all that stuff.
6861296	6864458	Anyway, I do want to go back though and address what was said earlier.
6864878	6866479	I'm not taking back what I said.
6866539	6867319	I'm not backtracking.
6867399	6870441	But I want to clarify what I mean when I say it's on my wish list.
6871281	6873041	My birthday is this week, okay?
6873121	6873741	My birthday.
6873861	6874962	My birthday is coming up.
6875022	6875822	It's my birthday.
6876282	6878662	It's not just OLR's birthday, but it's my birthday.
6879302	6881043	And I'm going to be a lot older than OLR.
6881903	6885984	And so when I say it's on my wish list, it's on my wish list for someone else to buy me.
6886024	6886624	I wouldn't mind.
6887424	6889244	But I have better things to buy for myself.
6889604	6892885	And I already know Husband did not get me a PSVR 2.
6892925	6894545	I already know what Husband got me for my birthday.
6894565	6895865	I actually brought it up on last week's show.
6895885	6897006	He got me the Evercade...
6900424	6903987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6916796	6928022	I do still, at least for the moment, and this is where I'm not going to backtrack my comment, I still look at PSVR 2 as a device that plays PSVR games and PC VR games.
6928523	6932025	So at the moment, it seems like an attractive option in that space.
6932645	6947422	that being said I do agree with what you're saying at the second part of that email and I think we see that in the news story we talked about earlier that even Sony seems to not have a lot of stock in this anymore and it's only a matter of time before PC ultimately surpasses it in that space
6948263	6952544	I think at the end of the day, I'm just interested in other things in tech right now.
6952744	6957046	I think VR has been unable to produce that must-have game.
6957626	6961187	It has been unable to produce that Wii Sports.
6961787	6964048	It's gotten close with...
6967009	6988563	like Beat Saber and maybe even VRChat to an extent although I still consider that a party trick sorry to the furry community I know that loves that game but I still consider it a party trick and Half-Life Alyx but I don't feel like anything is really just said no seriously you fucking need VR so until the industry makes it
6989837	6994259	I think I'm content buying a bunch of other bullshit as opposed to a VR headset.
6994299	6995800	I'm going to say wait.
6997021	6999622	I'm waiting.
6999862	7000642	For two words.
7001363	7003764	Vision Pro.
7003784	7009246	I don't know anything, but just having used one, I'm just going to say wait.
7010427	7012388	People are going to discover what it can do.
7014787	7023905	and I really have a feeling that we're going to see dedicated VR systems and not just the whole going the full tech route.
7024551	7029453	There's a lot of rumors in that space too, but we'll save that for another time.
7030213	7036756	YYR in chat though wants to say, Gran Turismo 7, Resident Evil 4 and 8 have made the headset worthwhile for some folks all by themselves.
7037697	7040478	Not to discount your comment, but there's a big problem.
7040838	7043259	There's a big problem with those three games that you mentioned.
7043339	7044239	No, the games are great.
7044980	7047261	They all are also playable outside of VR.
7048382	7054245	So, whereas VR may enhance the experience, VR doesn't feel necessary to the experience.
7055106	7055946	That's the problem.
7056587	7058148	So, anyway.
7058488	7068734	I'm just hoping that they finally port, whatever, the not-until-dawn, the other non-until-dawn game.
7068754	7069174	Oh, the Quarry?
7069194	7069434	Yeah.
7070451	7072172	No, not the quarry, the VR one.
7072252	7072892	I hope they port.
7073133	7076294	Actually, I hope they import Until Dawn of Russia Blood.
7076314	7077215	Yeah, I know what to tell you.
7077255	7079716	It's the, yeah, I know what to tell you about that.
7080397	7081477	Damn it, I can't remember the name of it.
7081557	7082418	No, not Russia Blood.
7082458	7084479	They did it on PSVR 2.
7084719	7087680	It was the anthology game.
7088421	7089021	Yeah.
7089081	7090302	Their other series, yeah.
7090962	7092583	I want that on VR, please.
7093223	7093884	Please and thank you.
7094920	7097343	Anyway, I think you said YYR had a second email.
7097484	7099307	Of course, I was just being a jerk earlier.
7100669	7125442	Okay, hello LR, I listened to last week's show during a 3 hour drive today and just wanted to drop a note, sorry for the double email Loki mentioned his trip to round 1 last weekend and mused that they might be getting an upgraded version of DDR soon Well actually both of the DDR cabs there were already running on the brand new DDR world while he was there All machines were automatically updated via network on June 12th and began running the new version once they received the update and were rebooted once
7126042	7130385	Just in case you're out of the DDR loop and want to try the new version, here are a few quick tips.
7131326	7137249	One, if you want to set options such as scrolling speed, you can no longer hold the decision button to access the options menu.
7137790	7147416	You can either press the number nine on the keypad that you use to enter your pin at login time or use the arrow buttons to highlight options from the difficulty selection screen.
7148036	7148857	No, you're not crazy.
7149497	7150858	I'm glad they made it easy for us.
7151379	7151819	That's nice.
7153419	7154159	No, you're not crazy.
7154219	7158720	There is now just one green generic animated background for literally every song in the game.
7158760	7160780	The dancing characters have once again been removed.
7161780	7165141	When selecting songs, the folders for version, level, genre, etc.
7165501	7167982	have all been removed or replaced by any filter feature.
7168082	7172362	Press number 6 on the keypad to adjust the filter.
7172902	7179324	You can select multiple criteria at once, so basically you get more power at the expense of simplicity.
7179724	7181104	Really, it's annoying until you get used to it.
7181704	7210183	and just a reminder in the USA you will only find this version at round one locations Dave and Busters is still stuck on A20 plus and if I had to guess in one to two years they'll all be gone and replaced by Step Maniacs we shall see enjoy your week and happy gaming AaronYYR with all due respect to YYR your email did not make me enthused to go play DDR World I have a Step Maniacs machine a lot closer to me downtown and I think I'll just go play that instead yeah they have a Step Maniacs machine there too um
7212017	7233139	Coinoff downtown got one my friends posted an Instagram story of them playing it and it looks bright and beautiful and that whole building got remodeled a few months that's why they were closed for a few months so I'm like super curious about that one I mean that's cool yeah I don't know like yeah it sucks that DDR is kind of like half-assed in it right now but
7234693	7237875	That just means the step charts will come out and I'll just put them on step me.
7238656	7240397	Because, I don't know.
7240958	7243760	Well, step me doesn't work on my PC anymore because my PC's broke.
7243960	7247122	The background thing is really weird to me.
7247563	7248584	It's cheap.
7248884	7250225	It sounds Russian cheap.
7251826	7252046	Oh, yeah.
7274810	7300093	the secret rendezvous that one that had all the people in the limo like those those visuals were really silly and fun that's some of the best part you know I'm gonna tell you a reason why I think all the backgrounds are like that plug and play updates as an internet style as you don't have to worry about new backgrounds and everything you are just importing the song into one set background and there you go
7303027	7304729	Dear OL Army, Dear OL Army, Dear OL Army,
7319023	7321064	Hey, it's your girl Mishi here.
7321664	7323825	Firstly, sorry for the lengthy email and bad grammar.
7324105	7324506	It's okay.
7324986	7327247	Has anyone picked up any new games this week, this month?
7327307	7328927	Any games you're looking forward to?
7329048	7330628	Well, I have and they're pretty fun too.
7331108	7333309	I managed to pick up two Farming Sims.
7333349	7334070	Yeah, let's go with that.
7334210	7334470	LOL.
7334970	7341013	Anyway, the games I picked up are called Moonstone Island where you play a fledgling alchemist who's sent away from home for a year.
7341673	7342173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7361641	7364022	This game is an extra of Animal Crossing meets Stardew Valley.
7364042	7368903	You play as someone who can't remember who they are or how they got to Ever After Falls.
7369383	7370723	In this game, there are quests.
7371043	7375144	You run a farm and also this game has a gardening mechanic.
7375644	7377385	To me, it's like creepy Stardew Valley.
7377485	7378825	Anyway, sorry for the long email.
7378845	7380145	With that, I'll say happy gaming.
7380185	7381566	Thanks for the show and have a great night.
7381766	7382726	Sincerely, Mishkins.
7383803	7385905	That was a tweet compared to YYR's emails.
7386085	7387526	Mish, you don't got to apologize.
7388526	7391529	No, but always a delight to hear from both individuals.
7392789	7404198	And yeah, I appreciate the recommendations of games that might not otherwise be on our radar because I think you kind of highlighted some more indie or smaller games that, you know, they don't always get a lot of coverage like some of the other games we talk about.
7404298	7407860	So I definitely rely on the listeners to put some of those games on our radar.
7407920	7411363	So I encourage you all to email us, participate at OrangeLandsRadar.com.
7412003	7436305	I think I heard a question in there though about what are we looking forward to for me personally my avatar DLC oh yeah I know that's up your alley yeah and for me for me it's expansions too Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail Diablo 4 or yeah Diablo 4 has their expansion in October other things I was trying to think like outside of that the Nintendo World Championships we were talking about earlier in the show is next month for sure
7436645	7437505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7458430	7459851	and what they're going to do with that.
7460171	7462072	My hope is it's going to turn out pretty good.
7462953	7469837	The Silent Hill 2 remake, again, speaking of morbid curiosities, I really feel like people have very polarizing opinions about that remake.
7470717	7471578	I want to try it out.
7472278	7474179	I definitely want to try out the Silent Hill 2 remake.
7474299	7478181	And then, of course, the Dragon Quest remasters we were talking about earlier in the show.
7478221	7479582	So there's a lot to look forward to for sure.
7481983	7483164	Loki, anything you're looking forward to?
7484639	7488280	I mean, it's probably the stuff I'm not aware of, like, you know, the game that's behind me.
7488340	7493342	Like, I was totally unaware of that, and then now it's out, and it's worth checking out.
7494442	7500144	As for upcoming games, I mean, the new Zelda game might be fun.
7503165	7505606	Yeah, I think it's just the stuff that I'm unaware of.
7505766	7506967	I do want to try...
7509574	7512456	Oh god, what's the... Obsidian RPG.
7513697	7519502	Oh, um... I want to say like Arisen, but it's not... Yeah, no, I know what you mean.
7519522	7519842	Avowed.
7519882	7521403	Yeah, Avowed.
7521563	7528589	I knew it began with an A. Yeah, Avowed I think would be kind of cool to check out because it has that Skyrim vibes and...
7530702	7554919	I'm like really enjoying indies like this year like like I said I've been like gushing over Turbo Kid that game looks awesome um and I've almost finished it and they keep updating it uh I definitely want to play um Blood I want to check that out um yeah I don't know so we'll see what other stuff comes out this year Squirrel the Gun yeah we'll play that
7557729	7558950	Great suggestions, everybody.
7559650	7563571	Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
7564271	7569373	Ranmari says, I want to give Diablo 4 a spin, but I'm hesitant to give money to Blizzard these days.
7569793	7572293	Well, for better or for worse, you wouldn't be giving money to Blizzard.
7572333	7574534	You'd be giving money to Microsoft at this point.
7574754	7577875	So again, for better or for worse, your choice on how you feel about that.
7578415	7584537	I will point out, though, that Microsoft does have Diablo 4 on Game Pass if you're a Game Pass person.
7585077	7591263	If you're not a Game Pass person, then I guess I would recommend check out streams and YouTubes and see if it's for you.
7591503	7597849	I love it, but I've also always had an affinity for Diablo and those types of games.
7598090	7601633	So I recognize that, yeah, my opinion's like really biased.
7601953	7603815	So it is what it is.
7603935	7608159	So yeah, I can only give you advice on how to check it out for yourself.
7609977	7611738	Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
7627829	7633752	Diablo 4, you know, it's still over the top in some ways, but it's not quite as fast-paced as 3 was.
7634152	7638914	Maybe it'll get there after all the expansions and stuff, but it's a little bit of a different flavor.
7638994	7640854	It's a little more in line with Diablo 2 than 3.
7643355	7643615	All right.
7645816	7647397	I think that's it.
7647917	7648597	Last-minute story.
7648938	7650278	Oh, yeah, last-minute stories, please.
7651138	7651399	Yeah.
7651919	7654920	So, everyone remember the Neptune story?
7656420	7656660	Oh, yes.
7682063	7683745	I've mentioned this many, many a time.
7683785	7686728	The Master System has stayed popular in Brazil.
7687309	7691333	So the Sega consoles are going to be a big thing.
7691473	7693536	I kind of want to get my hands on one of these, to be honest.
7695718	7696539	Anyway, I thought it was cool.
7696679	7697300	No, that's neat.
7697800	7698241	That's great.
7699983	7700723	Loki, how about you?
7700904	7701825	Any last-minute stories from you?
7703364	7717034	Yeah, so we have one from the Slay the Princess developer, Black Tabby Games, basically, well, they've deleted the tweets, but they basically said, hey, if you can't afford our game, go pirate it.
7719176	7721938	I feel like they're not the first developer to do this recently.
7723171	7737213	Yeah, I think it's more along the lines of like they're saying, you know, don't necessarily like watch through like everybody's playthroughs and stuff online, but you can pirate it and hey, we're going to be, you know, starting our games on a Steam summer sale on the 27th.
7737273	7744555	So you can go download it or buy it for a discounted price then if you can afford it or something like that.
7745675	7751796	I swear some other game did the exact same thing that said it wasn't the same, but they said I would rather you pirate our game than watch a Let's Play.
7753106	7757701	I swear there was somebody to say it wasn't the same but why can't we have both yeah I know I know
7759306	7760326	Anyway, interesting.
7761947	7763547	Well, everybody's entitled to their opinion.
7764267	7764607	All right.
7765227	7769628	Well, we hope you enjoyed our opinions over the last few hours, but we always welcome yours as well.

7780370	7781270	Shout it into the void.
7781290	7782491	I'll probably see it eventually.
7782951	7784051	So, yeah.
7785592	7794138	Oh, Rinmari reminds us, I did read about a game dev that said, we'd rather you pirate our game than buy keys on G2A that were probably obtained with credit card fraud.
7794219	7796120	Oh yeah, that was definitely a thing.
7796160	7797301	Yeah, for sure.
7798402	7801604	And then YYR wants to point out something he forgot in his DDR email.
7801985	7807269	There are no longer any differences gameplay wise between the gold 20th anniversary cabinet and the others.
7807749	7808289	Interesting.
7808850	7808950	Hmm.
7810285	7810805	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7836576	7838157	Those all go an awful long way.
7838237	7844821	So thank you for all of the nice reviews and word of mouth and even tweets and blue sky posts and all that good stuff.
7845201	7846742	We really appreciate y'all spreading the word.
7848363	7848824	Let's see.
7849564	7850745	I don't know what else to share here.
7850845	7852866	So I think I will just kick it over to final thoughts.
7853046	7855488	So DarkSakura, why don't you give us your final thought?
7857349	7880101	I'm having a sub-a-thon on the 20th Y'all can come if you want to Just really more of a hangout opportunity in between doing Giselle performance next Sunday So I don't know if I'll be here Then I have my recital in another two Saturdays Then I have that coming And then I have California Extreme is next month
7881202	7883387	I'm staying overnight for that.
7883467	7885332	This is going to be a busy month.
7885452	7889582	My feet are going to hurt and I'm going to have some bad eye strain.
7889742	7890023	That's all.
7890926	7910880	I officially have a gig at Bear Dive believe it or not that night Saturday night during California Extreme so I will not be able to go sadly but I mean not that sad because I love doing gigs and I love the troupe that I get to host for but the timing is a bummer of course tis what tis alright well have a great stream DarkSakura
7911701	7939100	thank you everybody we'll see you hopefully next week but maybe in two weeks it sounds like that's going to be interesting because Bobby Blackwolf isn't here next week either because the summer games don't click so yeah and I didn't realize it was I mean it starts at 2 but we come in like toward the end of the first act so I don't know how long I'm going to be there well just text me and we'll figure it out we'll make it up as we go along like we always do that's right that's how we keep it running alright bye DarkSakura
7940185	7943286	Alright then, Loki, that means we go to you and get your final thought tonight.
7944767	7950430	My final thought is I have more episodes coming out soon.
7950450	7959154	I'm taking a week off to work on the big theme park ride, the first major one, so hopefully we'll get that out in July.
7959174	7961415	Just be conservative about it.
7963128	7969111	My final thought is thank you to Sinister Creature Con for having me host the cosplay contest yesterday.
7969151	7971612	I had a lot of fun and there were some very creative costumes.
7972292	7974193	I really enjoy always seeing that type of stuff.
7974453	7980876	I really liked the audience choice winner who was kind of like an interpretation of Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas, but it looked really cool.
7981637	7983437	But I'm a fan of a lot of the outfits.
7983918	7984918	So thank you for that.
7985158	7989060	And yeah, I look forward to some more events here locally in the Sacramento area.
7989560	7996047	Rocky Horror Picture Show on July 20th and Scream Queens Gorlesque over at Bear Dive on July 27th.
7996528	8001673	So shout out to my friends at lovehorrorevents.com where all that stuff goes down.
8001773	8003955	So that is it.
8004016	8005797	DJ Ranma S says, can you share photos?
8006879	8007579	I think so.
8008200	8008400	I was...
8009741	8012043	I didn't take any because I was hosting it.
8012624	8013184	Oh, you know what?
8013705	8018648	Ranma, the professional photos, I mean, there's some phone photos that are out there, but you know what?
8018688	8021831	Our professional photographers, they'll start posting in the next couple days.
8021991	8031478	So when I have some of those, I'll send them to you because I think you'll enjoy some of the outfits because it's very different than an anime convention because, of course, you have people like Jason and Freddy and scary stuff.
8031719	8036723	Somebody did the May Queen from... Not Hereditary, the other one from...
8038666	8041989	Oh my god, Midsommar, which I thought was really clever as well.
8042049	8046072	So yeah, I'll share that once I have the professional photos.
8048013	8048754	That's really it.
8048834	8050636	Thank you again so much otherwise.
8051756	8054218	And that'll do it for this week's show.
8054238	8055980	We'll see you in seven days to do all over again.
