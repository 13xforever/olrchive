00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:10,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:41,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:46,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back once again to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:55,310
[SPEAKER_05]: We're live tonight, June 9th, 2024 with episode number 1007 of our show.

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,233
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week with my co-host.

7
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:09,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I hope you are having a lovely summer so far now that it's June, even though it's not officially summer, but summer enough.

9
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hot.

10
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:17,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from my work having a Pride event and me going out for an entire 20 minutes and coming in sunburned?

11
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:18,227
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

12
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:23,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why I didn't go to Pride downtown this week either.

13
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing.

14
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:26,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Pride needs a new month.

15
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:30,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why it's in June, but we need to find some other things.

16
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:33,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't there also October Pride stuff?

17
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:36,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're in Palm Springs, yes.

18
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:43,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they do an event here locally over Labor Day weekend, which I haven't been to in 13 years as long as I've been doing DragonCon.

19
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is completely put on by the

20
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,560
[SPEAKER_05]: March Pride March Pride

21
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be better.

22
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:02,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be lovely.

23
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:07,204
[SPEAKER_05]: March or even April, you know, a little rain during Pride.

24
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:08,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to complain about the wet t-shirts.

25
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,746
[SPEAKER_01]: April is reserved for autistic people.

26
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:11,346
[SPEAKER_01]: End of story.

27
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:12,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

28
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:13,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So, alright.

29
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,348
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm being silly.

30
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:16,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like...

31
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:22,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do like online pride with air conditioning.

32
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:23,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

33
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:24,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to 2020.

34
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,014
[SPEAKER_01]: With extra self-care.

35
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:27,596
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

36
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:33,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also practicing some self-care over there by rolling up Katamaris in the background there.

37
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:40,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one of the all-time best great little cute games that came out of nowhere and just, you know, changed everything.

38
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

39
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

40
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Loki, how are you doing?

41
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:44,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good.

42
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

43
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:49,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I'm referencing the video playing in the background, which is Katamari Damacy.

44
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it one of the sequels?

45
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:51,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful Katamari.

46
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:51,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

47
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:56,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because, I mean... We love that game here at OLR.

48
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:57,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

49
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:06,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Aside from we love the game at OLR, I couldn't think of a more fabulous person to showcase but then the king of the cosmos for, you know, Pride Month.

50
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:07,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for Pride Month.

51
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:09,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, perfect.

52
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Loki, ally.

53
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:12,204
Perfect!

54
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:20,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody sent me a message on Instagram and said, I didn't get that joke, and then I searched it on TikTok and I found it, and now it's funny.

55
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, Loki, ally.

56
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:25,209
[SPEAKER_05]: No, happy Pride Month to everybody out there.

57
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we kind of said that last week, but you know what?

58
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all month long, so I'll probably say it every week.

59
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:33,312
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, yeah, Katamari Damacy, really one of the all-time great games there.

60
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:51,724
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh yeah uh we of course I'm referencing the background of the video and you can see video uh every week as we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific at the Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

61
00:03:52,105 --> 00:04:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay uh we have a very very busy week full of news so I want to get into it because it wasn't E3 this week because do you know what the ESA did this week?

62
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Acknowledge their own 30th birthday with a timeline of things that they've done.

63
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:10,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they did this week.

64
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:12,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it empty?

65
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:13,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it page 404?

66
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:17,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, it was like, remember when we did E3?

67
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

68
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:46,709
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

69
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:02,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched them.

70
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched them and I... Good.

71
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:08,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad somebody here is on it because I couldn't be bothered apparently.

72
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Summer Games Fest I watched with some of my fellow Channel 64 folks and we also made fun of it because, you know, you have to.

73
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what internet people do.

74
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:18,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

75
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:19,089
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

76
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:19,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

77
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Break it down for us.

78
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with Summer Game Fest.

79
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

80
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So they kicked it off with LEGO Horizon Adventures, that rumored LEGO...

81
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,832
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some weird, like...

82
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:59,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Side characters that are not necessarily Horizon-based.

83
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:04,467
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like if you took LEGO Horizons and threw it in LEGO Fortnite.

84
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:05,467
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like that.

85
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really understand what the point of the game is, but it looks cool.

86
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:13,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it look like it has building stuff like LEGO Fortnite?

87
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:19,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you actually build your own encampment, but it's an encampment with...

88
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:23,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Merry Ground or like Carnival Rides and like tents and buildings.

89
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Things I think of when I think of Horizon Zero Dawn.

90
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:26,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

91
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:27,937
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the thing.

92
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:37,242
[SPEAKER_04]: What's also interesting about it is, well, first off, it's coming to PC as well, as well as PlayStation 5, but it's also coming to the Switch, which I thought was interesting.

93
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we get more cross-platform stuff.

94
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:42,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then it can't be that super powered if it's coming to the Switch.

95
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it does look really good.

96
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:47,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're getting a stripped down version of it.

97
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:50,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I mean, it is winter 2024.

98
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe it's targeting Switch 2.

99
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:52,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

100
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:53,363
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

101
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:53,964
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

102
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:57,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably fine.

103
00:06:58,598 --> 00:06:59,318
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds good.

104
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to check that game out.

105
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:01,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It does look good.

106
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty excited for it.

107
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,242
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed off No More Room in Hell 2.

108
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,824
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another zombie survival game.

109
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:12,766
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Harry Potter Quidditch Champions.

110
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:16,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game where you play Quidditch and it's Harry Potter and...

111
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,243
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out this September.

112
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:26,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a new game from the creator of Choo Choo Charles who put out this game called Cuff Bust.

113
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a game where you play koalas and you break out of prison as koalas.

114
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,413
[SPEAKER_04]: As koalas do.

115
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:37,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And you smoke joints because this is the type of humor that we have in 2024.

116
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that sounds funny.

117
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:45,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, we got another look at Star Wars Outlaws.

118
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:49,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, because they're koalas, do they all have over-the-top Australian accents?

119
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:57,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I did kind of just... It looked a lot like Fall Guys, almost, in the sense that they're very neon koalas.

120
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: They have jumpsuits, but their jumpsuits more look like spacesuits than they... I don't know.

121
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:04,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked funny.

122
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:04,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

123
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,615
[SPEAKER_05]: You sound like you were a designer on this game, Loki.

124
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,316
[SPEAKER_05]: This just sounds up your alley a little bit.

125
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:09,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

126
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,458
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like, I mean, it's stupid looking.

127
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't know.

128
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:14,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly more polished.

129
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but like stupid good.

130
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the movie Airplane is stupid, but it's stupid funny.

131
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:20,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

132
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:20,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

133
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:21,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

134
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:23,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Wars Outlaws have another trailer.

135
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:26,567
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get more of a look at that tomorrow during the Ubisoft showcase.

136
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:33,251
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the sequel to Grizz, which is Neva.

137
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not Grizz 2?

138
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,034
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no Grizz 2.

139
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:39,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Neva.

140
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:40,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

141
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:41,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different, you know.

142
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Neva, give me the name I want.

143
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:47,129
[SPEAKER_04]: The game that you're probably very excited for, Civ 7, was...

144
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:36,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if they ported it later I think it was consoles from the get go and 7 is going to be everything at once so that part is kind of interesting to me just how they have to kind of make it work on consoles as well we got another trailer for Black Myth Wukong which looks awesome I'm really interested to see what that game is going to look like it's not very far off coming out August 20th so that's going to be pretty cool

145
00:09:37,274 --> 00:10:03,242
[SPEAKER_04]: um once human by starry studios and that's coming out next month a little survivor like a horror game there uh metaphor and uh this was all of the all of the uh persona of course because it is the same studio putting this out um and it's they tried to explain like the different archetypes or whatever that you had in the game but like

146
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of over-explanation in the trailer that was just like, I don't understand what's going on.

147
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I feel the same way when I look at Persona.

148
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,257
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be heavy on the cinematics.

149
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:18,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure if you're a fan of Persona, you're going to be a fan of this.

150
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Which there's a lot of fans of Persona out there.

151
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

152
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:35,888
[SPEAKER_04]: New Batman Arkham game, which is funny because, you know, of how badly they botched Suicide Squad, but Batman Arkham Shadow coming to the MetaQuest 3 in fall.

153
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:41,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks okay, but no, I wouldn't buy a system for that.

154
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:45,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that they're trying to give VR that must-have title, right?

155
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Batman Arkham games were, for the most part, pretty darn good.

156
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:52,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate what they're trying to do.

157
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:54,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Godspeed.

158
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

159
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:56,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

160
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:05,309
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a reveal of like at first I was like, is this a new, you know, Fatal Fury game?

161
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:16,023
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we had the reveal for Street Fighter 6, which the new fighter pack, it's going to be including Terry Bogard from Fatal Fury.

162
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:22,526
[SPEAKER_04]: My, and M. Bison as well, which is kind of crazy.

163
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:24,087
[SPEAKER_05]: M. Bison wasn't already in Street Fighter?

164
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:27,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I haven't placed Street Fighter 6 as the demo.

165
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of shocked he wasn't already in it, to be honest.

166
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:37,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, Bison, and Bison looks, you know, it's kind of funny because Bison kind of looks like, I'm like, what is this, Evil Ken again?

167
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's got like a hoodie and everything.

168
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:42,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Bison with a hoodie.

169
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:50,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Deft in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, M. Bison was dead in Street Fighter V, but he got better.

170
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:51,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

171
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:52,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Characters don't die.

172
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Mortal Kombat.

173
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:55,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Characters don't die.

174
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:56,860
[SPEAKER_05]: He's temporarily dead.

175
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence why he's alive now.

176
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:00,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

177
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:00,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It's video games.

178
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,026
[SPEAKER_05]: They're never really dead.

179
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:06,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then also Alina is in there as well.

180
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

181
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks cool.

182
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:22,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to say, I actually, like, my and Terry, like, from Street Fighter, in Street Fighter 6, like, I feel like that's the closest we're ever going to get to a new SNK versus Capcom, so I'm like, I'll fucking take it.

183
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:28,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that actually has me more interested in Street Fighter 6 than a lot of news has.

184
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to, I legit need to pick that up.

185
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:30,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to, like,

186
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Grab it next time it's on sale or something.

187
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

188
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,861
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a trailer for Tears of Metal which is...

189
00:12:40,958 --> 00:13:08,589
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like a Scottish um action game but like it's it felt like I remember the comment that we were making when they were showing this I'm like this seems kind of like this is like a bad stereotype this game like it's just the characters if you can have a you know character that's 150 Scottish that's what this game looked like it was ridiculous it's almost yeah like I said like a stereotype um everybody with a headbutt

190
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:35,316
[SPEAKER_04]: it kind of but it's a roguelike uh co-op action game which is a another thing we were making fun of because there's a like almost every game they're showing is like roguelite it's like come on like can we do something different um Dragon Ball like I'm gonna be I'm gonna say it I I know it I'm gonna say it I like roguelikes I'm very brave okay yeah controversial yes uh Dragon Ball Sparking or Sparkling Zero uh

191
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta Force Hawk Ops

192
00:13:52,546 --> 00:14:00,870
[SPEAKER_04]: This just feels like military game word salad that we throw out to actually create a game title.

193
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,031
[SPEAKER_04]: This also has Black Hawk Down.

194
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardcore stealth ops special infantry.

195
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:11,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a very timely Black Hawk Down campaign mode.

196
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:14,656
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Black Hawk Down, the movie that just came out recently.

197
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:16,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie from like 15 years ago?

198
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:17,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

199
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:18,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

200
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,695
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, it's... I mean, you know what?

201
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:24,136
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of 80s movies.

202
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:32,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if they came out and said, like, hey, we're putting, like, Ferris Bueller's Day off into Fortnite, I'd be like, fuck yeah, let's do it.

203
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:40,266
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, I laugh at that as I'm literally excited for the next campaign of Dimension 20, which is based off of 80s action movies.

204
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, I probably should shut up.

205
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:43,088
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, next.

206
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:48,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking of SNK, Fatal Fury, City of Wolves.

207
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:48,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: New game coming out next year.

209
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:57,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had Battle Crush, which is an isometric character-based battle game.

210
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:05,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Mecha Break, which I got excited for because it's a mecha fighting game and it looks awesome and it's fast and...

211
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll never play it, but it looked cool.

212
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:16,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Then out of nowhere, Blumhouse saying, hey, we're opening a game studio now, and we're showcasing all of these games that we're putting out.

213
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So now Blumhouse Games has many different genre games coming out, a lot of them horror.

214
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:46,219
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of them kind of throwbacks to like older games there's one that looked like a like almost like a Pokemon game one that was like a 90s um horror like title when it almost looked like uh the original Silent Hill or something like that uh kind of interesting what they're doing with that I like companies that are willing to take risks on different games which is nice

215
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,620
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

216
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with all the news of closures we've had.

217
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:55,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I realize Blumhouse is publishing, not developing, it sounds like, at least from this.

218
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:59,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not exactly like a trade or whatever.

219
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:03,690
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I think they're really hot shit in movies right now.

220
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, obviously many people in chat right now are talking about Five Nights at Freddy's.

221
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously that did well for them.

222
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,615
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had a lot of, especially in the horror scene, they've done a lot of big stuff.

223
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that they're kind of lending that to...

224
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:18,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Games Now, that is kind of a big deal.

225
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to uplift some of these, you know, what were probably smaller, you know, more indie titles.

226
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,833
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

227
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a surprise announcement and a good thing.

228
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:42,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of like things out of nowhere, so we have a game from Digital Clips and Hasbro Retro Arcade, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Rita's Rewind.

229
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:45,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally is like an arcade game out of the 90s.

230
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,429
[SPEAKER_04]: They made one for the Power Rangers and it looks awesome.

231
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on PC.

232
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Ninja Turtles, but they put the Power Rangers in it.

233
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:58,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it looks a little bit like the Super Nintendo game that they came out with a while back.

234
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:04,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also have like some cool things like you're like first person Zord fighting and stuff like that.

235
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the mode seven stuff in there, it's like I have to OK, so I have to ask our biggest resident Ninja Turtles fan Tiger Claw in chat on a scale of one to ten where ten is hype and one is hype.

236
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:19,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, where, where are you at with the Power Rangers game?

237
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I got, I gotta know.

238
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, anybody in chat can answer.

239
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:23,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody in chat can answer.

240
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,684
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why am I limited, limiting it to one listener?

241
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:27,025
[SPEAKER_05]: One to ten.

242
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me how hype you are for that Power Rangers game.

243
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it does look, I, you know I love me a retro throwback.

244
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, yeah, I think that looks cool.

245
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:35,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

246
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:37,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Ranma says ten.

247
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:39,834
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTesilla says eight and a half, we'll say.

248
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Deft says eight.

249
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwell says three.

250
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:44,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Hater.

251
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

252
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:45,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

253
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,600
[SPEAKER_05]: but Bobby says I was never a Power Rangers kid.

254
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,021
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I get that.

255
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:53,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't either but I like me some retro beam ups.

256
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

257
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,664
[SPEAKER_05]: S200 Matt says 8.

258
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:57,144
[SPEAKER_05]: QuestBuster says 8.

259
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:07,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw says Power Rangers wasn't my thing in the 90s as it was around the time TMNT was in the height of its popularity so he didn't answer the question so I'm going to put a 10 in his place.

260
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:07,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

261
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,031
Anyway.

262
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was a game called Deer and Boy and

263
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:17,090
[SPEAKER_04]: you know

264
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:27,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making lots of Bambi jokes with this, but yeah, it's going to be one of those like companion, like emotional, deer's going to die at some point, right?

265
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:28,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's got to be.

266
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:30,122
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

267
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:32,162
[SPEAKER_04]: The deer's mom will die at some point.

268
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:33,103
[SPEAKER_04]: The deer's mom will die.

269
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:34,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

270
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 looks pretty awesome.

271
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,426
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, brutal medieval combat game.

272
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, FPS medieval game.

273
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:44,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

274
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Another look at Slitherhead.

275
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:58,658
[SPEAKER_04]: The game by the creator of Silent Hill that kind of resembles a little bit of Parasite Eve to me, but very gory and grotesque.

276
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

277
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:06,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting that that's going on when, you know, Silent Hill 2 remake, which obviously is, you know, Bloober's taking care of that one.

278
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting to see those parallels.

279
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:17,470
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I'd be curious which one the Silent Hill fan is more excited for because I feel like it's this one for sure.

280
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to me, it's kind of like...

281
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:43,598
[SPEAKER_04]: you know you have your Silent Hill 2 remake which is like your mighty number nine and then you have your Slitherhead which is kind of like your bloodstained ritual of the night it's you know two two studios kind of taking on you know IP and stuff like that but I think one's gonna be better than the other if you can catch my drift um

282
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I will play that Silent Hill 2 remake.

283
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:50,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks good enough.

284
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks better than the 2 and 3 HD remaster.

285
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks better than that.

286
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, that's a very low bar.

287
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:12,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a game that takes a stupid concept and then executes it extremely well is Killer Bean, which I'm not familiar with the character, but it's essentially like a Max Payne

288
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:33,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto type of game and I'll take it because I don't this had your name written all over it to me I did see this one and I was like this looks like a Loki game because it looks like Grand Theft Auto but stupid I like Grand Theft Auto and stupid but yeah like what Saints Row used to be like it kind of kind of I mean yeah yeah

289
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:53,239
[SPEAKER_04]: uh then we had Karen uh which is a realistic climbing challenge game oh oh I thought I was like nope nope we made somebody made a customer service game like what is this oh my god you're climbing the mountain to complain to the manager yeah it's

290
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,761
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare, why did a mountain climbing game take that name?

291
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:00,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it back, give it back so someone can make a horror game.

292
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:11,130
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, it is, like, for Karen, it would be spelled really stupid, so it's C-A-I-R-N.

293
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:18,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a, careful calling it that, because it could be like a language or cultural thing, so...

294
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:29,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, what I'm saying is it's not actually, you know, obviously it's not actually like the name Karen as in what we normally would use unless they were really trying to force that.

295
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:34,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's a realistic rock climbing game with like a story to it and stuff.

296
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a realistic rock climbing game.

297
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:41,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, what was the game that was not QWOP but it was something else?

298
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Only Up?

299
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not Only Up?

300
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm talking about though.

301
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:47,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting Over It?

302
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:48,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

303
00:21:51,348 --> 00:22:08,458
[SPEAKER_05]: he made another a few more games I think so yeah and Quest Buster okay yes a Karen is a pile of rock it is a real term so there it is okay all right yes yeah not so someone can still make the horror game with K-A-R-E-N okay

304
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:38,874
[SPEAKER_04]: uh okay uh Wander Stop it's a farming sim game with a tea shop management and like some it almost feels like horror elements to it or something because the character they were shown in the trailer seemed to have some sort of like haunted past or something like that but um it looks cute um then we got uh Unknown Nine Awakening a uh fantasy game I honestly like

305
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:43,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they need a subtitle to some of these games.

306
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:45,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call it Unknown 9.

307
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:47,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why we need The Awakening.

308
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:49,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're going to have a franchise or something.

309
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:52,018
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's see if the game does well first before we do that.

310
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Inotria, The Last Song.

311
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And they showed off a cinematic trailer for that.

312
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: That one looked interesting.

313
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,741
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of where...

314
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:05,518
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

315
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: The announcement of Outer Sloth.

316
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:30,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may know Inner Sloth, the folks that are behind Among Us.

317
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:39,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Outer Sloth is their funding, I guess their publishing funding arm, that they're talking about publishing different indie games.

318
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:48,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So using kind of the money that they've raked in from all of the Among Us stuff, including the TV show, which they showed off a trailer for.

319
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

320
00:23:50,340 --> 00:24:11,680
[SPEAKER_04]: meh like major meh on that um I mean they do have yeah but still consider that that game was made by a team of three people and now they're spending their money on all this stuff like it's pretty pretty uh yeah pretty neat to see that and you have a growth a tv show with Patton Oswalt, Elijah Wood, and Ashley Johnson in it I mean that's you know pretty cool um

321
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:13,329
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

322
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:20,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sonic and Shadow or Sonic Cross Shadow Generations or Sonic X Shadow Generations.

323
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:21,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

324
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:22,640
[SPEAKER_04]: X Cross.

325
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we're in Final Fantasy again.

326
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,045
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed that off again.

327
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be coming out in October.

328
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:30,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

329
00:24:32,611 --> 00:24:32,891
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

330
00:24:56,886 --> 00:25:00,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle Aces, which they said is like an RTS for everyone.

331
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:02,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

332
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:14,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I like an approachable game, whether it be with, for example, Minecraft Dungeons for like, you know, dungeon crawlers, but, you know, RTS games, it'd be nice to have something like that.

333
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:18,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, isn't Mario and Rabbids kind of an RTS game?

334
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:34,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it, I get it I don't often like to play RTSs because they're a little bit like, yeah, there's a lot in it so yeah, something that kind of peels it back a little bit and simplifies it, I think that's a good idea

335
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the Season 3 trailer for the finals, showing off their new map and some new weapons and whatnot that's going to be launching this week.

336
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:52,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Wake 2 is getting a physical edition, and they announced the Night Springs expansion.

337
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats, all of you that held out for the physical edition.

338
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:55,951
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

339
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:59,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks kind of crazy.

340
00:25:59,128 --> 00:26:02,671
[SPEAKER_04]: They have all the different characters from the different Remedy games.

341
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Rose, Tim Breaker, and Jesse Fadden.

342
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And that actually came out yesterday.

343
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of crazy.

344
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:17,282
[SPEAKER_04]: New World has an expansion coming that they showed off as well.

345
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Honkai Star Rail got another look at that.

346
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:21,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more patches.

347
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to skim through this because there's a lot.

348
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep going.

349
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:34,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark and Darker, which is like a dungeon crawler game, kind of resembled a little bit of like an Elder Scrolls or something like that.

350
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:39,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's different about this one is it is a extraction game, I think.

351
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:48,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a dungeon crawler, but you have to get out with the loot that you have, kind of a little bit like the Tarkov or something like that, but in the medieval setting, which is kind of neat.

352
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:49,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

353
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:52,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Mass Effect multiplayer or something where it's extraction survival.

354
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:53,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

355
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,286
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, let's see...

356
00:26:57,844 --> 00:27:00,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Kunitsu Gami, Path of the Goddess.

357
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:05,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a sword fighting game from Capcom.

358
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:15,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Hyper Light Breaker was another show that's going to be coming in early access here pretty soon this summer.

359
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:20,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Party Animals looks fun.

360
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:23,649
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of cute little animals with a bunch of different games that you play.

361
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:30,332
[SPEAKER_04]: A perfect example of how to waste your trailer time from EA for Skate.

362
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:34,554
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a trailer with Tim Robbins in it.

363
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:40,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Tim Robbins from I Think You Should Leave and stuff like that.

364
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not I Think You Should Leave.

365
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:44,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim Robinson, I'm sorry.

366
00:27:47,412 --> 00:28:15,261
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just they spent this four minute trailer they spent three and a half minutes with this weird sketch talking about M-Court basically abandoning a city but not really abandoning a city and then 30 seconds showing off that oh hey we're still working on the game and there's gonna be beta testing coming out you know this fall or something like that it's like did we really need all this stuff did you really need to spend the budget marketing this you know it was funny but

367
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:24,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it seems like a waste Also, for the crowd that goes back and watches things I don't bother with this type of stuff, right?

368
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly

369
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Pal Worlds getting an expansion, the Sakurajima update, brand new island, new pals, new fun stuff there.

370
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Also dedicated servers for Xbox as well, new raids.

371
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:46,110
[SPEAKER_05]: All that news made me do is go, I am shocked that Nintendo apparently is not going to do anything about this game.

372
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I really was convinced they were just waiting and building the case, but it seems clear and clear they're not going to stop it.

373
00:28:53,594 --> 00:28:55,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of shocked, actually.

374
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Valorant, they talked about some more updates with that as well also it's going to be coming to Xbox and Playstation 5 next week so June 14th and then Monster Hunter Wilds we got a look at that as well and it certainly looks like a very impressive looking Monster Hunter game

375
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a lot of people that are going to be into that one for sure.

376
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:28,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could get more into Monster Hunter because of the mobile.

377
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I hope they put out a demo or something so I can try it.

378
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:32,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And they usually do.

379
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The last two Monster Hunter games I think have had demos.

380
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:37,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to try it and see if maybe it clicks for me this time.

381
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:38,476
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

382
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:49,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, Phantom Blade Zero, which looks like a fantasy Japanese or feudal Japanese game.

383
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:49,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Civ 7

384
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:23,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I think obviously you know you know I love me some Civ which I did suggest last week by the way Civ 7 would be a great time to announce right now so yay

385
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well there's more!

386
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:32,374
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one, so then right after that, well this one was, I mean there was still a lot in this, but Day of the Devs, right?

387
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:33,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Day of the Devs, yes.

388
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:38,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was some more games shown off, Day of the Devs, more indie games of course.

389
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to just go through some of these real fast.

390
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:46,645
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Battle Vision Network by Capybara Games, a 1v1 puzzle battler game.

391
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:50,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of, they say it looks like Might and Magic Clash of Heroes.

392
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I haven't thought about that game in a while.

393
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:55,866
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a fun little puzzle game.

394
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely looks cute.

395
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, you know,

396
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I am 8-bit, it's a retro-styled RPG

397
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:30,712
[SPEAKER_04]: where we play a motorbike courier delivering flower pedal or flower powered digital pets.

398
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,534
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like for people that love their old school Pokemon.

399
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:37,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, it's got the Pokemon vibes for sure.

400
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma, The Dark World.

401
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:44,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a scary game.

402
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:46,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they say.

403
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:46,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

404
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:47,502
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no screenshots.

405
00:31:48,103 --> 00:32:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: but um yeah it's interesting this one's kind of cool i saw uh some of the screenshots from this ufo 50 so it is a game by moss mouth and it's a 50 in one game like collection but it's like all these like fake not fake games but like they made 50 different games within this collection it's kind of like those kind of um

406
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:14,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, like the minigame collections you would find out there.

407
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a clubhouse games type of thing?

408
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like clubhouse games, but these are actual retro-style games.

409
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily like cards.

410
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:28,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the one I'm looking at looks like Super Dodgeball, which was one of my favorite old-school NES-era games.

411
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:31,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the Kunio games.

412
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yeah.

413
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:36,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they all have anything in common, like a Kunio game?

414
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:39,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it just a mishmash of curated games?

415
00:32:40,356 --> 00:33:09,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they have a anything in common I'm trying to see real quick because I've like no they all look like they're from they all look retro they all essentially have like the same like block palette so it's like kind of a a hybrid between like a Super Nintendo and like a NES like Pixel Poops number two could have been in this except these are all widescreen games they're not three or four by three games probably better than Pixel Poops number two but yes yes for sure

416
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:35,070
[SPEAKER_04]: um okay so uh yeah i mean yeah there's like a lot of these different games kind of resemble stuff that i've played on the um nes and it's by a bunch of different developers as well so like from the creators like they said of splunky downwell time barons and i've never heard of this score plaque and madhouse um

417
00:33:35,987 --> 00:34:04,947
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's like a lot of developers just putting together like 50 brand new games they say these are not mini games or micro games although the size of each game varies everyone has a complete experience with its own title screen intro and ending some are small arcade style games but there are also larger open world adventures and JRPGs that could take many hours to beat interesting all right that's awesome I'm excited um what else let's see uh

418
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:12,108
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a ranger which is a it's a

419
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, I wonder if this is from Furniture and Mattress.

420
00:34:19,252 --> 00:34:22,454
[SPEAKER_04]: You're navigating a world by shifting rows and columns.

421
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:31,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It says the team has Braid artists and Karto writer on board.

422
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:32,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, cool.

423
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:35,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, the art looks very like Braid.

424
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

425
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

426
00:34:37,667 --> 00:35:04,874
[SPEAKER_04]: uh let's see there is one I'm trying to figure out which one oh this one's cool yeah Screenbound a game um where you walk around while holding kind of like what looks like a Game Boy um it's like a 3D world but then there's a 2D version that you're playing as well and they kind of link together which is interesting oh that's clever that's clever yeah so it's kind of kind of an interesting platforming game there um

427
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:06,749
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

428
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,450
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many games.

429
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:11,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I cannot stress how many games are here.

430
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:17,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Quoria is published by Dotnod, a stylistic isometric adventure game.

431
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:23,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Zuchosis from Clapperheads that...

432
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:54,251
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a horror game and apparently you're like a zookeeper but there's like horror stuff like they say here a giraffe turns into a spider monster and kangaroos with giant mouth bellies I don't like animals like that I don't know I would suggest going through these and probably just checking out a lot of the stuff because there may be stuff that you're going to find that you know that we

433
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:55,688
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably didn't cover.

434
00:35:55,708 --> 00:36:05,456
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, in fact, actually kind of going off tangent here, so I did try to check out some of the other ones as well, like the PC Gaming Showcase and

435
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Devolver Digital was doing their thing, their weird thing, as they normally do.

436
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:16,144
[SPEAKER_04]: PC Gaming Showcase was so boring, I couldn't get through it.

437
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:23,309
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is they're trying to be like Devolver Digital, but they're just not funny, and that's the problem.

438
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:26,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas Devolver at least had some cool games to look at.

439
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of them that I thought, Robby, probably be something you might be interested in is called Crush House.

440
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:36,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Crush House, it's essentially a dark comic dating life sim.

441
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:39,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine you're filming Big Brother.

442
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:52,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get to kind of edit and push people in different ways to get them to fight with each other in the Crush House or fall in love with each other and kind of...

443
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:58,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, twist how people are viewed on the show and stuff like that.

444
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:02,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's kind of set in the year 1999 as well.

445
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And you take the role of a producer.

446
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the year.

447
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:10,711
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was the year before like Survivor and all that stuff debuted.

448
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:11,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

449
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:23,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it says players will have to choose between 4 of 12 personalities to cast for each season of the show, trying to mix and match personalities to attract and create the most entertaining segments of reality TV.

450
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds dumb as fuck, I'm into it.

451
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:32,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a free demo that's currently on Steam, so you can check it out now.

452
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:33,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game's coming out August 9th.

453
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, it sounds like work.

454
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:37,728
Yeah.

455
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you play it and you tell us what it's like, okay?

456
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:44,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will.

457
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:57,435
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other thing I was going to name that I think caught my eye that Loki missed during the Day of the Devs, which is fine because there's a lot of stuff, is the game Afterlove EP because that game has rhythm game elements in it.

458
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:59,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be of interest to some of our fans.

459
00:38:00,397 --> 00:38:03,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it doesn't look like it's actually a rhythm game.

460
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it is kind of more of a narrative adventure, but it has rhythm elements in it.

461
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:10,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just one that caught my eye.

462
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:13,747
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another one that came up on my YouTube feed today.

463
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:19,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was announced at one of these events, but they just put out their announcement trailer.

464
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Unbeatable.

465
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:27,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a game by D-Cell, and it is a rhythm action game.

466
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:29,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I love their tagline on here.

467
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:32,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game where music is illegal and you do crimes.

468
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,461
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks cool.

469
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,943
[SPEAKER_04]: The art style is very well done.

470
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:39,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me a lot of...

471
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:46,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Hi-Fi Rush, but not like that style of presentation.

472
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:48,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a 3D beat-em-up game.

473
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:53,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of like a 2D, definitely more story-based.

474
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is also another one called...

475
00:38:57,895 --> 00:39:09,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Questbuster in chat calls one out as well Mike Laidlaw from Dragon Age fame also showed off his new RPG Eternal Strands on Friday it looks like it borrows a bit from Shadow of the Colossus and merges it with action combat and magic

476
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:27,751
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into another big one.

477
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:28,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

478
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:34,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into another big one in a minute here, but you all asked questions and I got answers.

479
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:36,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So you asked, what does Shane think of the Power Rangers game?

480
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:41,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why you might want to know his opinion is he used to host a show here on the network called Ranger Pride.

481
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:42,999
[SPEAKER_05]: He co-hosted that with Spike.

482
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:48,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it sunsetted some time ago, but he's kind of our resident Power Rangers fanboy.

483
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So I texted him, of course, and I said, listeners want to know your thoughts on Power Rangers game.

484
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the response I got.

485
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,550
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the response I got.

486
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, I was like, what's that?

487
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:00,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Why that?

488
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:16,294
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, it's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and also... So, if you kind of know Shane, it's one of those things where it's like he... The Mighty Morphin that was big here, they've obviously done all these other iterations of Power Rangers and Sentai since then.

489
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's kind of the same thing about why is it always Gen 1 with Pokemon?

490
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:20,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does it always count?

491
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's part that...

492
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:40,112
[SPEAKER_01]: and he says it's MMPR and also Hasbro killed the brand anyway so it's hard to care regardless so there's some other I kind of equal that I liked the Japanese series and never really cared for the US you know whatever they did to it so that's kind of the way I feel about it too

493
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:44,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess it really is nostalgia bait for many people.

494
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, you asked the opinion there, so there it is.

495
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into today's showcase from Xbox.

496
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:53,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say though at the top to break it up a little bit because we've just been going game after game after game.

497
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:58,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say, well, let me ask this, Loki, because you actually watched it and I can't say here.

498
00:40:58,321 --> 00:40:59,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I did watch this one, yeah.

499
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, oh, I thought you watched Summer Game Fest too.

500
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:25,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched Summer Game Fest and I watched this one so I'm curious like overall what was your thoughts on Summer Game Fest because to me it sounded a little like it's easy for me to come out here and say it didn't sound like it was a very strong showing but I also realized that with the industry like pretty fucked right now as far as like layoffs all these other types of things that it's going to take some

501
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:27,573
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

502
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:49,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's... I mean, I don't know if it's... I mean, sort of, I get that.

503
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:57,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think going into it with the expectations that I had, which was not much, it was fine.

504
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:02,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't really necessarily meet my expectations, but once again, I had no expectations.

505
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: If you went in thinking, oh, we're going to see Grand Theft Auto 6...

506
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:07,116
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

507
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you were an idiot and you deserved what you got.

508
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:12,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to tell you, I'm going to break it down for a bit.

509
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:12,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

510
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: If you went in with that high of a bar, you deserved what you got.

511
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

512
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:25,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see that there's a lot of independent titles, and that's the thing with a lot of these games that we're talking about.

513
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:25,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not...

514
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:27,645
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

515
00:42:46,471 --> 00:43:04,400
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly there are the bigger games that are going to be we're going to be talking about some here pretty soon but it is these indie studios and these up and coming games that are going to hopefully shed a light on some of this practice that's going on because right now what's unfortunate is we have all these big

516
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:17,919
[SPEAKER_04]: that are just like, hey, we're going all in on live service and we're going all in on the microtransactions and we're going all in on not innovating and we're just going to pump out with safe and do that.

517
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't the industry kind of

518
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:20,863
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

519
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:50,905
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

520
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:18,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you can see the interference by higher-ups and decisions made that just really screwed with that game.

521
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:24,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And same with even Redfall recently had the same type of issues.

522
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:30,827
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the influence by the C-suite or whatever on these games that have just destroyed it.

523
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:31,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately...

524
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:36,853
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in a world where everything's perfect and these people take accountability for their dumb decisions.

525
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish employees could sue executives.

526
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:44,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize with at-will employment and all that's never be the case.

527
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all can spare me the legal talk on why that isn't happening.

528
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:48,704
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can say I wish.

529
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:50,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say that would...

530
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:58,671
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's just, it's shitty that more executives out there aren't taking the brunt for what they forced in games, but I'm preaching to the choir.

531
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:04,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let me go back to what E3VL said in chat, which is especially Sony canceling a lot of live service.

532
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:07,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that also kind of shows like the pause, right?

533
00:45:08,378 --> 00:45:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: On the bubbles bursting on this.

534
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:11,660
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to pull this back.

535
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we're going to get into the Xbox stuff of which, you know, I can, I'll speak just general and overall real quick.

536
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:19,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, again, kind of looking at everything.

537
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:27,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird with Microsoft because that whole taste of the layoffs and everything still kind of burns.

538
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:28,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

539
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,540
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to watch this in some ways.

540
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time... Go ahead.

541
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:38,468
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was going to say, like when the two executives...

542
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:51,855
[SPEAKER_04]: that were part of, like, so you have the head of Xbox Game Studios, you have the other one that was, like, the head of, like, Xbox or whatever, I don't remember what division she, yeah, so you had those two.

543
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:54,517
[SPEAKER_04]: When they came on screen, I was pissed off to see them.

544
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, honestly, like, I was just, like, I really wish you were on this.

545
00:45:57,718 --> 00:46:00,600
[SPEAKER_04]: What purpose do you have to spout, like, garbage right now?

546
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Just show the trailers.

547
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't really need you here.

548
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:15,169
[SPEAKER_05]: or that maybe in this limelight showing moment where all eyes are on you, why not have some of your frontline employees be introducing these games?

549
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,330
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

550
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that idea.

551
00:46:20,012 --> 00:46:21,833
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I get what you're saying.

552
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:24,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's this, yeah, I get it.

553
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:29,959
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it was a pointless break between like trailers for them to come and say just literally just,

554
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:32,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Corporate garbage.

555
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:39,009
[SPEAKER_04]: It had no meaning other than like, oh, we have a new Xbox thing coming out or a new system lineup.

556
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need you to tell me that.

557
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:42,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I don't want to see your face right now.

558
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It is too soon.

559
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:45,230
[SPEAKER_04]: We're fighting, yeah.

560
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

561
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I don't know.

562
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:49,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It just felt really toned up.

563
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:52,252
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird that all that can be true, yet...

564
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:54,674
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

565
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:12,793
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

566
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:48,420
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think they did very well and it seems like a lot of reaction online is even from the most Xbox skeptical people you know there might be comments on the things we were just talking about which is completely understandable but overall it's like the games they were showing were like yeah this is uh they got a lot of good shit coming

567
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:52,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's because they own half the industry at this point.

568
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:52,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

569
00:47:53,192 --> 00:47:53,652
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

570
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:54,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

571
00:47:55,672 --> 00:48:06,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Xbox Showcase started off strong with Call of Duty Black Ops 6 taking place during the post-Cold War and during the George H.W.

572
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Bush administration era.

573
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

574
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: basically you know they show their campaign trailer off and stuff like that looks like Call of Duty I mean so what can I really say of course confirming that it is going to be on Game Pass day one the game I'm most excited for out of everything that they've showed off so far Doom the Dark Ages this was that rumored game that was supposed to be shown basically Doom set in you know

575
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:36,714
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

576
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of crazy.

577
00:48:47,814 --> 00:48:57,401
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have, you know, Doomguy with a shotgun and the brand new kind of chainsaw shield thing that he can throw like Captain America's shield.

578
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:58,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm there.

579
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds awesome.

580
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks awesome.

581
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:04,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be something that's coming out next year.

582
00:49:05,908 --> 00:49:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.

583
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:11,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually one, which is weird because like I'm not, I didn't play Doom Eternal or anything like that.

584
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:14,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like I recognize that it's a good game, but

585
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:15,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Age The Veil Guard

586
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:37,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Starfield, Shattered Space

587
00:49:56,464 --> 00:50:10,741
[SPEAKER_04]: which is going to be kind of more of a horror focused on that that's going to be launching later this year also there's going to be a free update that's out now that they did with some more bounties and some other stuff with that

588
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:16,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Quickly, Quest Buster, also, because I do want to bring this up, mentions about Dragon Age, Veil Guard.

589
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:28,325
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out near the end of this year, too, which it's almost shocking and hard to believe that finally we have a release of this year for that game, because it feels like the game's been in development forever, but that it was never coming out.

590
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:35,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they're going to show gameplay later this week, and I'm a little more interested in gameplay than story trailers, so we'll see.

591
00:50:36,087 --> 00:50:36,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

592
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:52,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Fallout 76 is getting a map expansion with Skyline Valley which they said is set in Shenandoah and they also showed off Vault 63 as well which is going to be a new vault and also tease at the very end of that trailer you can play as a ghoul soon.

593
00:50:55,244 --> 00:51:05,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Another interesting looking game called Expedition 33 essentially it's got Ben Starr in it and

594
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:32,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Pride and it's a fantasy game where essentially some sort of creature named I think is the artist or the painter or something like that counts down every year and apparently when they count down everybody that's that age or older well I guess not older everyone that's that age dies wasn't that the plot of the Maze Runner?

595
00:51:34,387 --> 00:51:35,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know I never watched the Maze Runner

596
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:40,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some gameplay.

597
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:43,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a turn-based RPG, right?

598
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is what people want.

599
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:44,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

600
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:45,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, there you go.

601
00:51:46,322 --> 00:51:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a turn-based RPG.

602
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:48,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it.

603
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:49,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play that.

604
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:50,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn-based, Ben Star.

605
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:52,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your $70.

606
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:52,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

607
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:55,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it a Game Pass game?

608
00:51:56,389 --> 00:51:57,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, all these are Game Pass games.

609
00:51:58,051 --> 00:51:59,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

610
00:51:59,972 --> 00:52:00,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

611
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:01,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

612
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these are Game Pass games.

613
00:52:03,635 --> 00:52:03,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

614
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:07,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Logan's Run, not The Maze Runner, sorry.

615
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:10,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I mixed up my old school sci-fi films.

616
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:16,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Logan's Run was more of like when you're 25, I think, or whatever, you get taken somewhere and shot.

617
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:22,154
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like, when you're of a certain age, you get Thanos snapped out of existence.

618
00:52:22,194 --> 00:52:23,675
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the difference here.

619
00:52:24,196 --> 00:52:26,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Better than throwing yourself off a cliff when you're 70.

620
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:27,818
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that different?

621
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

622
00:52:31,372 --> 00:52:32,473
[SPEAKER_04]: One's more instantaneous.

623
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:33,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

624
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:35,817
[SPEAKER_04]: We got gameplay of South of Midnight.

625
00:52:36,177 --> 00:52:41,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that kind of very stylistic game set and kind of like the bayou, that type of thing.

626
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:42,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks cool.

627
00:52:42,664 --> 00:52:44,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out in 2025.

628
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:58,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the trailer for the World of Warcraft, The War Within, the new expansion that's going to be coming out later this year in August 26th on PC.

629
00:53:00,153 --> 00:53:05,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to mention, though, as a quick aside, I'm surprised I didn't see Overwatch at all during this whole thing.

630
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:23,700
[SPEAKER_05]: that's one thing to note we didn't need her showing up and ruining the mood fair enough uh we got a trailer or gameplay trailer have you ever been to a party and then a certain person shows up and is like god the vibe just got killed it's you oh oh her

631
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:25,830
[SPEAKER_05]: This bitch.

632
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:32,735
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually changing the name of Overwatch to Oh Her.

633
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:35,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Her Watch.

634
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:40,801
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.

635
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:45,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, of course, the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.

636
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And some gameplay with that.

637
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it looks like Snake Eater.

638
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, as long as we have the song in there, which I know we will, that's all I need.

639
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:59,591
[SPEAKER_04]: CFE Season 13, they showed that off where you can be bad.

640
00:53:59,991 --> 00:54:03,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a big bad ship now and you can do bad things.

641
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: At first, like I thought, was this the whole...

642
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:09,216
[SPEAKER_04]: or not Pirates of the Caribbean.

643
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:11,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's good to be bad.

644
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:13,878
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the game?

645
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.

646
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,200
[SPEAKER_04]: LucasArts game.

647
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:20,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Monkey Island.

648
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:20,962
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

649
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:25,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was that all over again because the one pirate guy looked like LeChuck.

650
00:54:26,825 --> 00:54:28,726
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not because they've already done that in a previous season.

651
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:30,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Like three times, yeah.

652
00:54:30,987 --> 00:54:32,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, four times.

653
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:32,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

654
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:33,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.

655
00:54:34,249 --> 00:54:34,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not bad.

656
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just drawn that way.

657
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:42,154
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Flintlock, The Siege of Dawn.

658
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:49,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a I guess they say it's a fusing melee weaponry and guns.

659
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they showed this at a previous thing.

660
00:54:54,063 --> 00:54:56,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looked familiar.

661
00:54:56,905 --> 00:55:06,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Age of Mythology Retold looks like an original or it's a remake of the 2002 game and that's going to be coming out on September 4th.

662
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:13,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We got gameplay, I think, sort of, of Perfect Dark.

663
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:20,576
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks different than I remember the last Perfect Dark game I played, which is from the Xbox 360.

664
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:24,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what this Perfect Dark is anymore, but it looks good.

665
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:25,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool.

666
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:34,882
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the intro, I think, for Diablo 4, the new expansion, the Vessel of Hatred.

667
00:55:36,075 --> 00:55:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did a little cinematic for that?

668
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:51,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so as the Resident Diablo 4 fan, I will say that I don't usually care about cinematics, but Blizzard Cinematic in particular has always knocked it out of the park, and this one was very, very fucking good.

669
00:55:51,872 --> 00:55:54,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Diablo 4 News Diablo 4 News Diablo 4 News Diablo 4 News

670
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,801
[SPEAKER_05]: They stealth dropped pets on the game.

671
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:17,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So they just released pets into the game today.

672
00:56:17,563 --> 00:56:21,366
[SPEAKER_05]: They put out a 3 gig patch and now you can finally get a pet dog.

673
00:56:21,406 --> 00:56:23,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have a quest to do a pet dog.

674
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:24,969
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you get other pets?

675
00:56:25,089 --> 00:56:27,030
[SPEAKER_05]: By pre-ordering the expansion, of course.

676
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Or pre-purchasing, excuse me, because that's the thing that Blizzard does.

677
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:33,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-purchasing the expansion, you can get different pets.

678
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:33,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

679
00:56:34,255 --> 00:56:37,716
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get a very good dog friend for free in the game right now.

680
00:56:37,776 --> 00:56:39,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a quest that takes you five seconds to do.

681
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:42,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The quest is literally, you found a dog.

682
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:43,658
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

683
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:50,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And most importantly, the tutorial teaches you you can interact with the dog.

684
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,702
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, if you say hello to the dog, you actually pet the dog.

685
00:56:56,072 --> 00:57:20,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad developers realize that this like in the year 2024 like what's fucking important so like they realize like never mind that the dog picks up the gold and the crafting stuff for you which is a very good quality of life improvement in Diablo never mind that's if they just want to let you know you can pet the fucking dog yes you can that's it that's all that matters and that was the best news out of this entire week

686
00:57:22,998 --> 00:57:47,005
[SPEAKER_04]: we got more of a story trailer for the new Fable game and it's been confirmed hopefully to be coming next year I do not sorry I muted myself from clapping I do not want another goddamn story trailer for Fable gameplay gameplay gameplay it looks neat

687
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:48,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm with you.

688
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:53,663
[SPEAKER_05]: How's Hellblade 2 selling, by the way, after all that rollout?

689
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:56,047
[SPEAKER_04]: No talking about Hellblade 2 either.

690
00:57:56,067 --> 00:57:58,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And then no fucking hype when it comes out.

691
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:00,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there you go.

692
00:58:00,817 --> 00:58:10,741
[SPEAKER_04]: See, instead of having, was it Matt Booty in there for a few seconds to say some absolute trash that means literally nothing, you could have put, hey, do you remember that Hellblade 2 is out?

693
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:14,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that game we hyped like 10 times and it came out?

694
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that game came out and it's available now on Game Pass?

695
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:17,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get it.

696
00:58:18,544 --> 00:58:20,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, seriously, I 100% agree with you, Logie.

697
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:23,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's dumb.

698
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:38,212
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed off a new 5v5 hero shooter, yay, called Frag Punk, but it has a unique twist to it at least, where you get these cards that essentially dynamically change the game.

699
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:49,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had one that shows it flips the world upside down, or one that adds electricity to your bullets or something like that, or big head mode so you can get easier headshots.

700
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:50,775
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks kind of neat.

701
00:58:51,536 --> 00:58:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's Frag Punk.

702
00:58:54,697 --> 00:59:03,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter Burrow, which is a cute little mouse survival game and a farming sim.

703
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really sure much about that.

704
00:59:06,702 --> 00:59:07,803
[SPEAKER_04]: This one was really cool.

705
00:59:07,863 --> 00:59:17,527
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mixtape, which is a kind of a... It feels very like...

706
00:59:18,928 --> 00:59:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is Strange almost but it's you know kind of like a slice of life you know in the 90s uh it's got that kind of uh I don't know like Life is Strange almost type of thing but it's got a really cool soundtrack as well to go along with it so they got Devo, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, um Suzy and the Banshees, Joy Division and more

707
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:48,454
[SPEAKER_04]: and looks fun.

708
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Help me show my age through this game.

709
00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

710
00:59:55,638 --> 00:59:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's by Annapurna.

711
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:12,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and they showed off some of the new stuff with that, including a lot of the different, you know, occupations that you can play around with in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

712
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:19,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, you know, they have agriculture, aviation, cargo transport, search and rescue.

713
01:00:19,537 --> 01:00:28,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, unintentional Xbox noise on the thing there, but I was like, oh, right, I forgot that this was announced, and I have not watched the footage for this game yet, because...

714
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:46,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Flight Simulator games are always like oh my god the graphics in these games are so fucking good I had to like see like what this looks like because oh my god Flight Simulator like the problem Flight Simulator is kind of a hard game

715
01:00:46,738 --> 01:00:47,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Fight Seeing Mode

716
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:23,412
[SPEAKER_05]: but god it's so seriously they need to just have a mode where you just like rocket man mode where you just fly around the world in a jetpack with unlimited fuel because it's so beautiful so beautiful anyway I could just

717
01:01:25,444 --> 01:01:27,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to get high and play this game.

718
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:29,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just call it what it is.

719
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just call it what it is.

720
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to chill out and just watch the pretty visuals.

721
01:01:38,014 --> 01:01:39,676
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get high and get high.

722
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:41,377
[SPEAKER_05]: High in altitude, of course.

723
01:01:41,437 --> 01:01:41,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, yes.

724
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:44,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get high in altitude in a video game.

725
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never endorse anything else.

726
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:49,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, it's legal.

727
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but still.

728
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:53,367
[SPEAKER_01]: At least here it is.

729
01:01:54,597 --> 01:01:58,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we had the new expansion for Elder Scrolls Online, Gold Road.

730
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:01,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be coming out here in a couple weeks.

731
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine days, actually.

732
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:03,329
[SPEAKER_04]: June 18th.

733
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:05,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold up, hold up.

734
01:02:05,632 --> 01:02:06,753
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going back to Flight Simulator.

735
01:02:07,694 --> 01:02:10,218
[SPEAKER_01]: That came up in conversation yesterday, actually, that game.

736
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there a mode in Flight Simulator where you're taking pictures of Bambi?

737
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

738
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not flying?

739
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:21,636
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you do when you... Because there's a photo mode, but then there's deer.

740
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:25,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just play... Can Microsoft just give me that fucking game?

741
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that looks really good.

742
01:02:27,321 --> 01:02:29,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Just world travel the game where you go and take pictures of things?

743
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Take pictures of pretty shit.

744
01:02:31,504 --> 01:02:32,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I want.

745
01:02:34,506 --> 01:02:35,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Take an edible...

746
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,661
[SPEAKER_05]: and Take Pictures of Pretty Shit.

747
01:02:37,881 --> 01:02:39,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the game I want to play.

748
01:02:39,482 --> 01:02:41,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what is wrong with developers?

749
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how about you could just fly to, like, Forza Horizons and then go take pictures in that.

750
01:02:45,926 --> 01:02:47,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be a spectator in Forza Horizons.

751
01:02:47,827 --> 01:02:49,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just cross the games over, you know?

752
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:50,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

753
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:53,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a good photo mode, though.

754
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I've been going to town with that Avatar game.

755
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,973
[SPEAKER_05]: They even have the fucking northern lights.

756
01:02:58,073 --> 01:02:58,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, this...

757
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:01,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It is gorgeous.

758
01:03:01,506 --> 01:03:03,007
[SPEAKER_05]: This game does not get enough credit.

759
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:03,488
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.

760
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:05,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm sorry to derail everything, but also I'm not.

761
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:10,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's great because it's so immersive because your computer sounds like it's taking off when it's running the game.

762
01:03:11,074 --> 01:03:16,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know, it's the feeling of immersion of the jet engines going.

763
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play it on an Xbox Series X or through the cloud or something.

764
01:03:21,543 --> 01:03:25,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't look as good in the cloud, but you can play it on a Series X, I'm sure.

765
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

766
01:03:26,748 --> 01:03:26,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

767
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:33,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry, I derailed whatever other thing you were talking about, but taking pictures of Bambi is important.

768
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:36,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Elder Scrolls Online Gold Road coming out in nine days.

769
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:48,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is Strange Double Exposure, which is apparently, you know, a story with Max, who is now dealing with like an alternate reality where she's trying to figure out, you know,

770
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:49,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

771
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:16,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly looks better than the movies, or at least the new movies.

772
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:18,800
[SPEAKER_04]: The recent movies, not the old movies.

773
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:22,942
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm down, so it looks cool.

774
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:29,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We got another look at Mecha Break, but that was in the other showcase.

775
01:04:30,606 --> 01:04:36,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Wuchang Fallen Feathers, which is kind of like some Bloodborne-looking game.

776
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:44,786
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the briefest trailer possible for Avowed, which the entire time we were traveling, like, is this Elder Scrolls?

777
01:04:45,366 --> 01:04:46,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this Elder Scrolls?

778
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:51,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's not Elder Scrolls because it's sort of Elder Scrolls, but not.

779
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:53,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very Elder Scrolls.

780
01:04:53,808 --> 01:05:06,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to go along with that, to even confuse me even more of games that are sort of Bethesda, but not Bethesda, we have a game that looks like Fallout, but in London, which I was like, is this...

781
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:08,844
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think it is.

782
01:05:09,124 --> 01:05:15,946
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's another game franchise called Atomfall, which is essentially like Fallout, but in London.

783
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:20,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have big robots and all sorts of weird stuff going on.

784
01:05:22,408 --> 01:05:23,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks cool.

785
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:24,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check that out.

786
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:25,889
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm surprised it's not Fallout.

787
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Another trailer for Assassin's Creed Shadows.

788
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,331
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably see more of that stuff later.

789
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:35,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow, we got a gameplay trailer of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

790
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:37,000
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, Heart of Chernobyl.

791
01:05:37,681 --> 01:05:38,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked pretty cool.

792
01:05:39,862 --> 01:05:44,426
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the announcement of the Xbox Series X and S hardware refresh.

793
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:50,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be doing three new consoles refreshes.

794
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is an Xbox Series X, all digital, so it looks like a refrigerator with a door you can't open.

795
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:20,805
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's gonna be in white what if they had a tiny little refrigerator where the drive used to be where you could cool like one can of Mountain Dew like that's that's the Xbox I need I mean they have the refrigerator already that looks like the Xbox Series X that's true that's true it's just gonna be confusing I've been tempted to buy that fridge is this the game system I don't know it's like it's both um

796
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:24,702
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's going to be coming out with a one.

797
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:32,707
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also going to have a one terabyte Series S in robot white, which I was like, wasn't the Series S always in white?

798
01:06:32,747 --> 01:06:33,828
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently it's not.

799
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently they had.

800
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:36,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

801
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:40,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Several people in chat, by the way, telling me that that Xbox fridge is not worth it.

802
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:41,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwell says it's not a mini fridge.

803
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:42,673
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a cooler.

804
01:06:43,053 --> 01:06:44,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it and I was disappointed.

805
01:06:44,294 --> 01:06:46,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Pod Culture says, Rob, it ain't that great.

806
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:47,216
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

807
01:06:47,276 --> 01:06:47,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

808
01:06:48,157 --> 01:06:48,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut me up.

809
01:06:50,032 --> 01:07:11,469
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they also had a special edition Xbox Series X in Galaxy Black with 2TB of storage and a disk drive and what you may ask is Galaxy Black, it's like someone put their Xbox Series X next to some place where someone was spray painting and some little particulates of the spray paint got onto the Xbox

810
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:14,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

811
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:15,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

812
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:18,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's also $600.

813
01:07:18,192 --> 01:07:19,953
[SPEAKER_05]: The bigger storage, I guess, is neat.

814
01:07:20,613 --> 01:07:27,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, two terabytes, I guess, is nice when you consider that, you know, Black Ops 6 is 300 gigabytes.

815
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:29,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.

816
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what that's that folks for you with the wonderful Xfinity that's a third of your month's download isn't that great isn't it great to be gaming in the future just just wait until you see the game size of that fucking flight simulator game that's all I have to say and then last but not least the one more thing was Gears of War E-Day it is a prequel was it really a surprise though

817
01:07:57,533 --> 01:08:01,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't expecting because I've completely forgotten about Gears of War, so it's fine.

818
01:08:03,564 --> 01:08:04,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there you go.

819
01:08:04,385 --> 01:08:05,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, a lot going on there.

820
01:08:05,986 --> 01:08:06,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

821
01:08:06,706 --> 01:08:08,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears of War, a game that exists.

822
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will say the biggest shock is that it's not Gears of War 6.

823
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:12,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Gears of War Subtitle.

824
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, you know what?

825
01:08:16,653 --> 01:08:18,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like it was actually a really good commercial for Game Pass.

826
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know not everything is a game, because like Assassin's Creed, I don't think those games usually go to Game Pass, but it sounds like there was a good chunk of things they showed that they are going to Game Pass, and I think Game Pass definitely needs that kick in the butt right now, so that's neat.

827
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:35,318
[SPEAKER_05]: so, alright

828
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:41,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, lots and lots of announcements this week and definitely sets up what the rest of the year is going to look like.

829
01:08:41,723 --> 01:08:45,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we're waiting to see if Nintendo will perhaps announce something.

830
01:08:45,765 --> 01:08:55,709
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was looking at our Discord because we do, you know, we not only take your calls on Discord, but we also chat with you guys throughout the week at our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

831
01:08:56,089 --> 01:09:02,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw in our chat, somebody had posted that I guess on Reddit, somebody had leaked a Nintendo Direct.

832
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:04,092
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens every time.

833
01:09:04,112 --> 01:09:05,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to tell you, I looked at that list.

834
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:08,309
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's not real.

835
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:12,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure it's very, very obvious that it's not real and there's a hundred of these.

836
01:09:12,512 --> 01:09:13,153
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not real.

837
01:09:14,073 --> 01:09:20,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why it's not real is because number one, it has an F-Zero GX remaster on it and that game's never coming out.

838
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:22,499
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one reason.

839
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, you can go look at the Discord what I said.

840
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:27,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I said something nasty in response to that.

841
01:09:27,102 --> 01:09:28,162
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go look at Discord what I said.

842
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:30,764
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is true, I said I would do something nasty.

843
01:09:31,164 --> 01:09:31,444
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

844
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:33,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the real thing.

845
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:34,626
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

846
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:44,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I said I would go to Nintendo headquarters and give handjobs in the parking lot.

847
01:09:44,572 --> 01:09:45,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said.

848
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:47,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's not bad.

849
01:09:47,213 --> 01:09:49,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I actually redacted myself, but there you go.

850
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:56,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but here's the thing, is that in that list, it's missing...

851
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:58,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Indie titles.

852
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:07,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that Nintendo does indie directs, but that doesn't mean they aren't going to showcase smaller studio things in their summer showcase.

853
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:19,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think every bad leak list out there neglects this, is that they don't just focus on Nintendo and the big third parties.

854
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:21,685
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always little announcements too.

855
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:23,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why that list ain't real.

856
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,827
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I would love to see whatever really happens from Nintendo.

857
01:10:27,647 --> 01:10:30,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And if my arm's going to be very tired in Washington, then fine.

858
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:33,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the game I want more than anything.

859
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd become the most popular podcaster with Nintendo.

860
01:10:38,272 --> 01:10:39,112
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean I'm not already?

861
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:41,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

862
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:42,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

863
01:10:43,982 --> 01:10:44,743
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

864
01:11:01,184 --> 01:11:07,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to fight with playing Baldur's Gate 3 on GeForce.

865
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:13,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It had worked great before, and this time, I don't know if it's just the virtual environment, but it's reading.

866
01:11:13,835 --> 01:11:21,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had this problem where it reads my Logitech controller as an Xbox controller when, if anything, it's more like a PlayStation controller.

867
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:44,427
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have to redo all this stuff on it so I was fighting that but I did play a little bit I also played some Avatar on my own I'm waiting for the season pass that I got with my order to come through definitely played some Dead by Daylight I had a really entertaining night playing Dead by Daylight honestly

868
01:11:46,810 --> 01:12:04,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also played a crap ton of pinball because I did go with Dan to a little party with the pinball group and I got to play Labyrinth, which I felt it was a little dark and honestly less fun than I thought it was going to be.

869
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

870
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:20,127
[SPEAKER_01]: um i mean it wasn't bad don't get me wrong uh and maybe i just needed to play it a little bit more um and also i will admit someone was talking in my ear the whole time i was playing it and i'd like to be able to concentrate on the game um

871
01:12:21,664 --> 01:12:23,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Looney Tunes.

872
01:12:23,304 --> 01:12:24,325
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Looney Tunes table.

873
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:26,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a lot of fun.

874
01:12:26,285 --> 01:12:28,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a blast to play.

875
01:12:28,966 --> 01:12:30,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely love it.

876
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:33,707
[SPEAKER_01]: You find one in the wild, you play the hell out of it.

877
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:34,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.

878
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:46,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played Total Annihilation, which is one of the... Just a really, really fun table.

879
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:47,531
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the multi-morphics.

880
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:49,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played Woe Nelly...

881
01:12:50,882 --> 01:12:54,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Juicy Melons Big Juicy Melons Big Juicy Melons

882
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, she was holding them up.

883
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you a picture of what it looks like.

884
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:13,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.

885
01:13:15,802 --> 01:13:21,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played Tron for a little bit, because the friends had a Tron, and they also had the cutest bulldog ever.

886
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:30,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was playing that stupid RuPaul's Drag Race game.

887
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so stupid, and I love it.

888
01:13:36,314 --> 01:13:54,234
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the Willow Pill event going on and I myself am going back to watching that season because I haven't seen it through so alright we all have guilty pleasures in gaming, it happens and it's probably on your mobile device alright

889
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:56,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I need something to do.

890
01:13:56,452 --> 01:13:59,776
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain's sort of like, I have played Pulp Fiction, by the way, Bobby.

891
01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:03,459
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reasonably fun.

892
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:06,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really find it super engaging to play.

893
01:14:08,004 --> 01:14:08,344
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

894
01:14:08,585 --> 01:14:10,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go over to Loki.

895
01:14:10,066 --> 01:14:10,727
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

896
01:14:12,345 --> 01:14:14,366
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was all Minecraft.

897
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:18,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working on stuff for my latest episode, which came out today.

898
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:31,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So I built the entrance to my theme park, and I created artwork for my season pass that I have in the game that you use to get in and out of the theme park.

899
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:33,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the theme park.

900
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:34,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We would use it to get out.

901
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,810
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be ridiculous.

902
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:38,691
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's...

903
01:14:40,066 --> 01:14:43,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a long time to get everything done just right.

904
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:44,429
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's out now.

905
01:14:44,449 --> 01:14:44,990
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go watch it.

906
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:46,751
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

907
01:14:46,871 --> 01:14:47,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's all I did.

908
01:14:48,893 --> 01:14:49,553
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

909
01:14:49,593 --> 01:14:51,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I usually do.

910
01:14:52,035 --> 01:14:53,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did some streaming this week.

911
01:14:53,757 --> 01:14:58,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been the first time in a couple months, but I played some Mr. Pandaria Remix and World of Warcraft.

912
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my monk tank to max level right now, which is 70.

913
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:05,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So otherwise been collecting the little collectibles because that's what you're doing in the remix mode.

914
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:06,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a heck of a lot of fun.

915
01:15:07,387 --> 01:15:09,869
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

916
01:15:36,145 --> 01:15:42,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but then, uh, let's see, uh, addition to that, I've also been playing Diablo 4 because there's a XP boost event going on right now.

917
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:46,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to make sure I make the most of that and try to get my seasonal character as far as I can.

918
01:15:46,957 --> 01:15:49,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, I actually played something new this week, or at least new to me.

919
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a game that was out, then it wasn't out, and now it's out again.

920
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:56,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a friend that's really into it.

921
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:57,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's been kind of like, come on, play this game.

922
01:15:57,988 --> 01:15:58,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, come on, come on.

923
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

924
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:46,526
[SPEAKER_05]: but like I don't know it didn't feel quite as chaotic as I think Smash Brothers matches sometimes do um also I'm not good at it um so there was only a little bit that I could do and if you don't pay for the characters you can only use like four or five characters so I was playing as Jason from Friday the 13th who was one of the free characters and I enjoyed doing the move where you shove somebody into a sleeping bag and then go pound pound pound pound like pound them in the sleeping bag so that was making me laugh um

925
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:49,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my review of multiverses.

926
01:16:51,212 --> 01:16:52,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to say.

927
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:57,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm applauding in my mind.

928
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

929
01:17:26,672 --> 01:17:27,632
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my gaming.

930
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:33,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to mention real quick since you were talking about your gaming week and you talked earlier about Street Fighter 6.

931
01:17:33,493 --> 01:17:35,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It is half off this weekend.

932
01:17:35,394 --> 01:17:37,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Deft already pointed that out.

933
01:17:37,154 --> 01:17:37,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

934
01:17:37,714 --> 01:17:39,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Deft already pointed that out to me.

935
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:43,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
01:17:43,095 --> 01:17:44,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the heads up and my

937
01:17:45,436 --> 01:17:46,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Wallet is currently crying.

938
01:17:46,817 --> 01:17:49,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that there will be spills any time soon.

939
01:17:49,558 --> 01:17:54,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard wants me to pay $90 for the expansion of Diablo 4.

940
01:17:54,481 --> 01:18:01,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the limited edition version because, or whatever they call it, Super Digital Collector Edition, because it has the kitty pet.

941
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:04,406
[SPEAKER_05]: If I paid the most expensive.

942
01:18:04,926 --> 01:18:06,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The expansion itself is, I think, $30.

943
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:08,568
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not quite so bad.

944
01:18:08,628 --> 01:18:11,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, of course, they want to find a way to...

945
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:18,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Suck every dollar out of the wallet of the most hardcore fans, of which I'm kind of one of them, so I don't know.

946
01:18:18,992 --> 01:18:23,313
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have held off successfully so far, so we'll see how long I'm able to last.

947
01:18:24,814 --> 01:18:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's it for my game.

948
01:18:25,694 --> 01:18:26,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that you can get later?

949
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:27,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it only...

950
01:18:29,573 --> 01:18:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

951
01:18:31,234 --> 01:18:38,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to think I could get it later because I feel like these companies are always willing to sell you digital upgrades.

952
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix is still offering me every time I sign into Mogstation on 14, don't you want to get a digital collectible edition upgrade for Heaven's Word, the expansion that came out 10 years ago?

953
01:18:49,526 --> 01:18:50,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, no, I'm good.

954
01:18:50,787 --> 01:18:54,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the pet and the minion that come with that.

955
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:55,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I have 500 minions and 200 mounts.

956
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:55,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need

957
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:01,994
[SPEAKER_05]: One more for 30 bucks or whatever they want to charge that upgrade.

958
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:02,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

959
01:19:03,175 --> 01:19:07,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So Square's going, hey, hey, kids, hey, kids, you want to buy some NFTs?

960
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:08,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll buy some NFTs?

961
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:11,059
[SPEAKER_05]: No, luckily they aren't NFTs.

962
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Not not not this time anyway.

963
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,401
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't work out for him.

964
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:19,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, actually, Loki, you bring up a good point.

965
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to celebrate from all these games we've heard about.

966
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:25,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to celebrate from all these big titles and indie titles.

967
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:31,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't hear a goddamn thing about NFTs during the biggest week in game announcement.

968
01:19:31,674 --> 01:19:32,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's celebrate that.

969
01:19:32,795 --> 01:19:35,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a moment to just pat ourselves on the back.

970
01:19:35,998 --> 01:19:37,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, everyone.

971
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We killed NFTs in the gaming industry.

972
01:19:43,204 --> 01:19:45,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some gaming.

973
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:51,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's always going to be NFT bullshit and dark quarters of the internet, but if you're still on Twitter, then that's on you.

974
01:19:51,293 --> 01:19:53,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

975
01:19:53,716 --> 01:19:56,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, let's talk about some other gaming news.

976
01:19:56,339 --> 01:19:57,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Other things that happened this week.

977
01:19:58,348 --> 01:20:12,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so there's been, you know, obviously with all the different game showcases, it is not to be forgotten about all of the game studio layoffs that we've had already within the last few months.

978
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just like never ending, it seems like.

979
01:20:15,805 --> 01:20:31,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So along with that, in LA, downtown LA, right next to where some of these are being shown, we have electronic billboards talking about the different studios that have been, they're gone but not forgotten.

980
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:35,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So they mention Arcane Austin, Roll7, Tango Gameworks.

981
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Volition, I believe it's Sony London Studios, and it says everyone laid off, downsized, or made redundant.

982
01:20:47,184 --> 01:20:51,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your great games, your friends at New Blood.

983
01:20:53,727 --> 01:20:56,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So I assume it's another indie studio.

984
01:20:57,129 --> 01:20:59,350
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you, we miss you, we hate money.

985
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,951
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

986
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Good on them for saying something.

987
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:13,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Good on them for putting that front and center and reminding how we got to these announcements was unfortunately a lot of these closures.

988
01:21:14,985 --> 01:21:16,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's very interesting.

989
01:21:19,146 --> 01:21:20,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, everybody's talking about it now.

990
01:21:20,647 --> 01:21:21,587
[SPEAKER_05]: So money well spent, right?

991
01:21:21,607 --> 01:21:22,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

992
01:21:23,906 --> 01:21:29,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to the New Blood Interactive CEO, he's like, I'm always trying to find new and creative ways to waste money.

993
01:21:31,294 --> 01:21:32,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that was a waste of money.

994
01:21:32,815 --> 01:21:36,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe he could have created a job out of that, but fine.

995
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not, not for a billboard.

996
01:21:39,642 --> 01:21:41,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, billboards aren't quite that much, but still.

997
01:21:41,624 --> 01:22:01,330
[SPEAKER_04]: along with that of course Jeff Keighley also did happen to mention a little bit of it during the whole presentation for some games fest stating that I know if you watch this show you don't just play games you deeply care about this art form and the health of the industry the good news is we have a lot of amazing games to show you from creators around the world over the next two hours

998
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:08,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it, this has been a difficult, tumultuous year with company layoffs and studio closures that disappointed all of us.

999
01:22:09,093 --> 01:22:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I get inspired by new ideas, the new teams, and the smaller creators.

1000
01:22:15,315 --> 01:22:16,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I can and will break through.

1001
01:22:16,756 --> 01:22:20,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a reminder that big companies, they have to treat their developers right.

1002
01:22:20,717 --> 01:22:23,218
[SPEAKER_04]: But because today there are money paths...

1003
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:29,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Money Paths to Sustainability and Success and that's, I think he meant many paths.

1004
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:31,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's misquoted there.

1005
01:22:33,513 --> 01:22:34,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's money paths.

1006
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:39,236
[SPEAKER_04]: The success in what makes this industry so, so great.

1007
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:54,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, he said some souls of creators were invited to the showcase their games because we think this platform is an important way to show new things that you may not even know about, which in the case of like that Koala game I was telling you about, that's developed by one person.

1008
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:57,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1009
01:22:57,607 --> 01:22:59,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So he actually said that at the show?

1010
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:01,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that internet?

1011
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1012
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:03,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I didn't watch it.

1013
01:23:03,524 --> 01:23:07,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the rest was like interviews with... Oh, maybe he did.

1014
01:23:07,787 --> 01:23:08,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1015
01:23:08,187 --> 01:23:12,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I missed part of that in the very, very beginning of the show, but...

1016
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:43,635
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah Bobby's saying he opened with it on stage and sort of reminding us also Jeff's basically saying laid off start your own indie studio not every person can do that they need job stability yeah you know in a perfect world that would be the answer is that you know and I know I've said that on this show too but I always try to kind of put the footnote of if you can if you're able to you know that would be the best thing that could come from this but not everybody seems like a sign of being out of touch a little bit a little bit yeah so anyway

1017
01:23:46,316 --> 01:24:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: um well I'm glad he said something about it at least and kind of like reminded folks of you know the price of a lot of this uh at least he acknowledged it yeah he probably should have done that six months ago at the game awards but um better late than never I suppose um

1018
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:07,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, maybe better late than never, the PlayStation VR 2 coming to PC.

1019
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:16,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we kind of knew that this was happening because a couple weeks ago, PlayStation had originally sort of unveiled that they were plotting this whole thing.

1020
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:19,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But this week, we got a lot more details on this.

1021
01:24:19,214 --> 01:24:22,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So the adapter for the PC is coming on August 7th.

1022
01:24:23,817 --> 01:24:31,160
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a PSVR 2, which of course was released for the PlayStation 5, you will now be able to hook this up and play PC games.

1023
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:37,762
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it even shows in a screenshot Half-Life Alyx, which of course is a game that's unique to Steam.

1024
01:24:39,122 --> 01:24:51,687
[SPEAKER_05]: In an official PlayStation blog post that went up this week, Sony mentioned they built the PSVR 2 from the ground up specifically for PlayStation 5, and that's why some features that are on the PS5 are not going to be on PC.

1025
01:24:52,907 --> 01:24:58,449
[SPEAKER_05]: HGR, Headset Feedback, Adaptive Triggers, Eye Tracking, Haptic Feedback

1026
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:15,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1027
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:48,489
[SPEAKER_04]: their PlayStation VR 2 they're going to start porting some of that stuff to PC maybe and it would be nice to be able to have the full features on PC since you're going to ignore your PlayStation VR 2 platform I don't know I wouldn't say never say never

1028
01:25:49,282 --> 01:25:58,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But you will get 4K resolution, 110 degree field of view, see-through view, finger touch detection, 3D audio, all that stuff will be there.

1029
01:25:59,010 --> 01:25:59,550
[SPEAKER_05]: The price, $60, $59.99.

1030
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:00,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, I call that $60.

1031
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: and you will have to have a DisplayPort 1.4 cable to use the headset on PC that cable is not included also if you want to know the minimum specs that was all released as well so you will know if this is something that you can work with or not I will say as somebody who only has the PlayStation VR original headset this does make the PSVR 2 headset a little more attractive knowing that it would work not just for the PlayStation games but for

1032
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:52,662
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Steam, VR games as well I'm not sure I'm ready to take the plunge still But I'll say I'm a lot more there than I was before Like now, maybe we'll put it this way It's kind of like a wish list item now I don't think I'll actually spend the money on it But it's like a wish list Like if one fell in my lap, I wouldn't be upset

1033
01:26:53,442 --> 01:27:17,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, well, I mean, if you already have one, if you already have a PlayStation VR 2, I'd say it's a pretty good investment, but I would have to say, like, if I'm going to invest in, like, say, buying a PlayStation VR 2 to use on PC, I would want to see how that compares, like, with other headsets that are out there right now, like, what the, you know, performance is going to be, and with all of the absence of, like, HDR and stuff.

1034
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:18,461
[SPEAKER_04]: HDR's

1035
01:27:19,249 --> 01:27:25,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a huge deal, but some of the other stuff, like the adaptive triggers and that type of thing, kind of is annoying.

1036
01:27:26,437 --> 01:27:31,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when you consider that they have that built into the controllers themselves.

1037
01:27:32,304 --> 01:27:37,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an API that they need to have available for people that want to use it.

1038
01:27:39,537 --> 01:27:39,777
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1039
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sega has let us down.

1040
01:28:13,834 --> 01:28:25,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say easy, just let us down completely by saying that there are going to be no other Sega Mini anything released this year.

1041
01:28:28,699 --> 01:28:35,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, and this is a translated quote, I think you'll forget a lot of things after two years.

1042
01:28:35,646 --> 01:28:39,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you watch this program again after a long time, I think you'll enjoy it again.

1043
01:28:40,111 --> 01:28:46,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying, you know, again, there's no, I don't get what that has to do with there not being any, but he wants fans to rewatch the 2022 announcement.

1044
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:51,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, uh, no.

1045
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:58,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the fourth anniversary of the Game Gear Micro's reveal.

1046
01:28:58,909 --> 01:29:01,551
[SPEAKER_01]: 64th birthday of Sega as a company.

1047
01:29:03,593 --> 01:29:08,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did have a poll to see what many hardware people want next, and Saturn came out on top.

1048
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:09,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1049
01:29:11,139 --> 01:29:16,562
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Saturn would be really hard to minimize.

1050
01:29:17,962 --> 01:29:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the Saturn is that hard, I would of course think the Dreamcast.

1051
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:26,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, then again, the Dreamcast runs basically in a Windows-compatible environment, so who knows.

1052
01:29:29,387 --> 01:29:37,050
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in another story that popped up, there is a fan-made Saturn Mini version

1053
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:45,569
[SPEAKER_01]: that someone has made and is trying to reach out to see if it's possible to market that.

1054
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1055
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:50,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably be a lot of rights things with that, but yeah.

1056
01:29:52,074 --> 01:29:54,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, it's not like they're saying never.

1057
01:29:54,836 --> 01:29:57,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's a whole, so you're saying there's a chance to this whole thing.

1058
01:29:57,678 --> 01:29:58,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not going to happen this year.

1059
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,060
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?

1060
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,082
[SPEAKER_01]: You sounded all digitally to me for a moment.

1061
01:30:04,382 --> 01:30:06,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds very, so you're saying there's a chance.

1062
01:30:09,366 --> 01:30:09,667
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

1063
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:16,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's a robot.

1064
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:18,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've known this since the 80s.

1065
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:21,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fact that we need to accept nowadays.

1066
01:30:21,393 --> 01:30:27,577
[SPEAKER_05]: But the ironic thing is the stream goes out from my place, so I'm the one that's clear to everybody out there unless the stream is hiccuping.

1067
01:30:27,637 --> 01:30:32,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But looking at missed frames, it doesn't look like the stream's hiccuping, so it's just some weird internet blip.

1068
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:34,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Discord.

1069
01:30:34,822 --> 01:30:35,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Blame Discord.

1070
01:30:35,623 --> 01:30:35,943
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1071
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:36,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid.

1072
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:38,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's blame other things on the internet.

1073
01:30:39,406 --> 01:30:39,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1074
01:30:41,556 --> 01:30:48,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I mean, another strike against emulation, I guess, and piracy, maybe?

1075
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:54,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So Vimslare, one of the oldest places on the internet to find and download ROMs and emulators.

1076
01:30:54,306 --> 01:30:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that's still running.

1077
01:30:55,748 --> 01:30:56,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognized that name.

1078
01:30:56,969 --> 01:30:59,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, holy shit, that's still a thing.

1079
01:30:59,691 --> 01:31:08,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently they've announced that they had to remove many titles from Sega Nintendo and Sony, the ESA and LEGO.

1080
01:31:11,505 --> 01:31:12,946
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the ESA published?

1081
01:31:13,286 --> 01:31:13,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

1082
01:31:13,907 --> 01:31:15,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they would mention them, but whatever.

1083
01:31:16,648 --> 01:31:22,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So they posted a post on June 5th announcing minigames that are removed following requests from various companies.

1084
01:31:22,773 --> 01:31:28,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Vim's Lair has been asked to remove minigames from the vault on behalf of... Hold up.

1085
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:28,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Pause.

1086
01:31:28,556 --> 01:31:28,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Pause.

1087
01:31:29,017 --> 01:31:29,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Pause.

1088
01:31:29,997 --> 01:31:31,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ESA is one of those companies.

1089
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So who do you think... They made a request.

1090
01:31:35,361 --> 01:31:36,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Who do you think put this whole thing together?

1091
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:39,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there you go.

1092
01:31:39,632 --> 01:31:40,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they've been doing this month.

1093
01:31:41,113 --> 01:31:47,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So since there's no E3 anymore, they have the legal time to go shut down these ROM sites.

1094
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, I understand.

1095
01:31:49,457 --> 01:31:54,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Say what you will about piracy, although these games are years and years and years old.

1096
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, okay, fine.

1097
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:56,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a virtual console, me?

1098
01:31:57,702 --> 01:31:58,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Switch Online?

1099
01:31:58,842 --> 01:31:59,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, fine, fine.

1100
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:03,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But all it's doing is driving this shit further underground.

1101
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:12,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Now these are all going to be the e-ticket items on Discord servers and other underground places around the internet.

1102
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all it is.

1103
01:32:14,127 --> 01:32:25,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good that they took care of it now because we know now that emulation and ROMs have thoroughly been destroyed and that it is over now.

1104
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:27,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Piracy is over thanks to the ESA.

1105
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:28,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly...

1106
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:35,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This is happening because the number one, well, I don't know if it's still the number one app on the iOS store, but it was for a hot minute.

1107
01:32:35,796 --> 01:32:39,019
[SPEAKER_05]: The number one app on the iOS store was an emulator.

1108
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:44,323
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why this is happening now because what are the games people want to play first off?

1109
01:32:44,363 --> 01:32:47,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably one of those games you just mentioned minus the ESA thing.

1110
01:32:48,447 --> 01:32:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, what I'm saying is it's ridiculous to think that this makes any sort of dent in anything.

1111
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so stupid.

1112
01:32:57,865 --> 01:32:59,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just going to drive it for the runaround.

1113
01:32:59,468 --> 01:32:59,789
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

1114
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure.

1115
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:02,911
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it harder to smash?

1116
01:33:02,931 --> 01:33:04,192
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1117
01:33:04,592 --> 01:33:05,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1118
01:33:06,633 --> 01:33:08,254
[SPEAKER_05]: What do people want to have?

1119
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:10,795
[SPEAKER_05]: The games that they're not supposed to have.

1120
01:33:11,255 --> 01:33:23,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just made people a checklist of things that they should be going to get because it's very clear that now you're chasing down these things so it's just going to make people want to have a backup of these games on their computer even more.

1121
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:25,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1122
01:33:27,901 --> 01:33:32,127
[SPEAKER_05]: but only the ESA would be applying logic from 1995 to this whole situation.

1123
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:41,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they are celebrating their impact on the industry having not been able to pull off a show for three years now.

1124
01:33:43,063 --> 01:33:44,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are awesome.

1125
01:33:45,498 --> 01:33:53,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, in the arena of questionable legal things, we know Nintendo has had some leaks in the past.

1126
01:33:53,846 --> 01:33:57,309
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you might remember that the game Yoshi was leaked.

1127
01:33:57,409 --> 01:34:03,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, although it was actually, it was Yoshi when it was announced and then it became Yoshi's Crafted World.

1128
01:34:04,315 --> 01:34:05,756
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1129
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:25,013
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1130
01:34:43,243 --> 01:34:45,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo and why has Nintendo evolved with this?

1131
01:34:45,764 --> 01:35:10,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Because apparently in 2017, these documents show that a contractor who had administrative access, who worked with Google, who owns YouTube, of course, used their admin privileges at YouTube to download and watch what was assumably a private or unlisted trailer for a Yoshi game that Nintendo was about to unveil.

1132
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:17,695
[SPEAKER_05]: That contractor shared it with a friend who, of course, immediately took that screenshot to Reddit.

1133
01:35:18,355 --> 01:35:25,340
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why all of my friends know that if they ever share private information I give them, they will be killed because that's what friends do.

1134
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to keep secrets for a bitch.

1135
01:35:30,283 --> 01:35:31,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know why.

1136
01:35:32,243 --> 01:35:34,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously the most untrustworthy friend in the world.

1137
01:35:35,425 --> 01:35:42,107
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, yeah, they were the one that went over to Reddit and then another Google employee saw it and recognized it.

1138
01:35:42,147 --> 01:35:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting because if you actually see the screenshot, you can see there's like an admin.youtube thing in the URL complete with most of the key in there that I'm sure made this very easy to trace back.

1139
01:35:53,072 --> 01:35:53,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Google's full statement on this.

1140
01:36:07,947 --> 01:36:08,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so anyway.

1141
01:36:35,236 --> 01:37:01,133
[SPEAKER_05]: that's how stuff got leaked was because somebody put a private video on YouTube and somebody else watched it and I'm sure that's going to make everybody think twice about the private videos they're putting on YouTube not that anybody's putting porn up there because I'm sure you know automated filtering and stuff looks for that but you know it's very very interesting so if you keep a personal diary or something there's other people out there that could absolutely watch it if they wanted to food for thought

1142
01:37:03,464 --> 01:37:05,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on to some better news.

1143
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:06,346
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1144
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:20,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, and going into the concept of this is game preservation, there has been a long lost game that was found and preserved.

1145
01:37:21,157 --> 01:37:23,839
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Tarzan for Atari.

1146
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, thought to be gone forever.

1147
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:32,286
[SPEAKER_01]: But nope, it was, uh,

1148
01:37:33,607 --> 01:37:45,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be published by Coleco for the 2600 and then for the ColecoVision in 1984, but it was Tarzan.

1149
01:37:45,867 --> 01:37:47,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out...

1150
01:37:49,722 --> 01:38:12,743
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, with those release dates that they had announced in 1983 at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show They had been talking about that port and that it just kept moving by and moving by and moving by And it didn't really get a release But a collector named Rob, but not you

1151
01:38:13,744 --> 01:38:28,683
[SPEAKER_01]: who goes by AtariSpot managed to find a working copy of the game from a former Coleco employee and worked with another homebrew programmer Thomas Jench and got it dumped and it

1152
01:38:30,046 --> 01:38:36,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of those games that used the bank switching to get around the hardware limitation.

1153
01:38:38,892 --> 01:38:43,496
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they managed to get the game working and now it's out there.

1154
01:38:45,537 --> 01:38:46,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Score one for preservation.

1155
01:38:47,999 --> 01:38:54,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he actually received two Tarzan boards but only one worked.

1156
01:38:54,624 --> 01:38:54,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1157
01:38:57,082 --> 01:39:24,416
[SPEAKER_05]: so there you go always fun to unearth things from many many many many many years ago that you know just didn't come out for whatever you know sometimes publishing reason or you know with the crash and everything that was happening in the industry at the time yeah very cool I'm looking at the game in play and like it has some pretty in-depth stuff for it and some neat animations and everything so not bad I'd be curious to check it out

1158
01:39:26,172 --> 01:39:34,495
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, going from the classic industry to the modern industry, Loki, you were very strongly hinting at some of this earlier in the show in a story that's making the rounds this week.

1159
01:39:35,956 --> 01:39:45,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Suicide Squad, there was a report with Bloomberg talking about what happened?

1160
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why this bomb?

1161
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it's going to come as a shock.

1162
01:39:50,626 --> 01:39:58,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what had happened was... What happened was, apparently, they said there wasn't a single cause of Suicide Squad's failure.

1163
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:15,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, Rocksteady Studios' project was hurt by an unclear and shifting creative vision, ill-fated pivot to a completely new genre, and the perfectionism of the former creative director Sefton Hill, who left the team prior to release to head up a brand new studio.

1164
01:40:16,724 --> 01:40:16,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1165
01:40:17,725 --> 01:40:27,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently Sefton Hill created a bottleneck during the development process with people waiting a week or longer for him to sign off on individual elements of the shooter.

1166
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:42,477
[SPEAKER_04]: At one point, he apparently had the idea to introduce an in-depth vehicle customization aspect to the game, balked at others on the team since it would seem to undermine Suicide Squad's emphasis on its anti-heroes' individual traversal abilities.

1167
01:40:44,283 --> 01:40:48,539
[SPEAKER_04]: and they said that of course it has very bad vehicle missions in it which is kind of

1168
01:40:49,577 --> 01:41:12,911
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe part of what he did also he scrapped big chunks of the script and struggled to convey his evolving ideas um they said according to the article confessed that he had spent much of his time playing games like Destiny and um you know these setbacks were compounded by the increasing tech debt due to short-term fixes for projects some hope would shift early 2020 um

1169
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't they stop the game from releasing?

1170
01:41:16,874 --> 01:41:17,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Warner Bros.

1171
01:41:17,674 --> 01:41:20,056
[SPEAKER_04]: executives apparently didn't see anything wrong with this.

1172
01:41:20,456 --> 01:41:21,537
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't seem concerned at all.

1173
01:41:21,597 --> 01:41:26,661
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept reviewing the demonstrations of the game and sending laudatory feedback, praising the graphics.

1174
01:41:28,342 --> 01:41:32,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's the only thing a fucking boardroom person knows how to review is the graphics.

1175
01:41:32,905 --> 01:41:33,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, looks good.

1176
01:41:33,706 --> 01:41:34,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1177
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:34,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks cute.

1178
01:41:34,827 --> 01:41:38,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying they expected Suicide Squad to become a billion dollar franchise.

1179
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:42,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the graphics are really good.

1180
01:41:43,274 --> 01:41:47,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, since then... Somebody show the Warner Brothers board the Flight Simulator trailer.

1181
01:41:47,197 --> 01:41:48,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to know their thoughts.

1182
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:53,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So, since then, they've put out updates.

1183
01:41:54,402 --> 01:41:58,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Season 1, for example, was released in two chunks because it was garbage.

1184
01:41:59,545 --> 01:42:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Both episodes are now available for people to play.

1185
01:42:04,108 --> 01:42:08,932
[SPEAKER_04]: They said their developer updates will change from being weekly to releasing them when we have big news.

1186
01:42:09,732 --> 01:42:10,973
[SPEAKER_04]: to share about future content.

1187
01:42:11,354 --> 01:42:15,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's funny is their content is all recycled content as well.

1188
01:42:15,657 --> 01:42:20,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all of the stuff from season one, like all the boss fights that are in there are recycled boss fights from the game.

1189
01:42:22,362 --> 01:42:22,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like...

1190
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:27,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad... I don't get it.

1191
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:31,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, it's very... When you said, why did Suicide Squad bomb?

1192
01:42:32,334 --> 01:42:35,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, the easy answer for this is executive mismanagement.

1193
01:42:35,976 --> 01:42:43,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad this article goes so far as to name who in the executive team was at fault and why.

1194
01:42:44,442 --> 01:42:50,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think it feels a little bit like setting one person up to take the fall because the reality is...

1195
01:42:51,167 --> 01:42:52,428
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1196
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:12,369
[SPEAKER_05]: This person, sure, is setting up to take the fall and was doing a very crappy job at their job.

1197
01:43:12,449 --> 01:43:16,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I'm not going to say, but who's watching the Watchmen?

1198
01:43:16,832 --> 01:43:17,833
[SPEAKER_05]: That type of thing.

1199
01:43:17,873 --> 01:43:21,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's making sure that that guy's doing what he's supposed to be doing?

1200
01:43:21,636 --> 01:43:24,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And that this shouldn't come out late.

1201
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:26,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, S200 Matt says, just blame Zaslav.

1202
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:26,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

1203
01:43:27,521 --> 01:43:28,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It's his fault.

1204
01:43:28,081 --> 01:43:33,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and also it sounds like the executives don't understand what a game is supposed to be.

1205
01:43:33,245 --> 01:43:35,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So the executives literally don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1206
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:41,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like, it's like if you just shot fireworks in their face.

1207
01:43:42,143 --> 01:43:44,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's essentially what the game looks like anyways.

1208
01:43:44,205 --> 01:43:49,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like shooting fireworks in their face and they're like, oh, it's so amazing.

1209
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:54,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and that's the thing too, is like you look at this game and it's not really amazing graphically.

1210
01:43:54,835 --> 01:43:57,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like there are like the cut scenes are pretty good.

1211
01:43:57,418 --> 01:44:02,142
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion capture is good on it, but the gameplay is trash and like the game is trash.

1212
01:44:02,142 --> 01:44:06,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it just goes to show the biggest problem in the gaming industry right now is a boardroom.

1213
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,068
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the biggest problem.

1214
01:44:08,088 --> 01:44:09,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It was why do we keep talking about?

1215
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:11,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is the answer?

1216
01:44:11,891 --> 01:44:13,793
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go start your own indie studio.

1217
01:44:13,853 --> 01:44:17,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to have these types of problems because what's missing in an indie studio?

1218
01:44:17,977 --> 01:44:18,517
[SPEAKER_05]: A boardroom.

1219
01:44:19,358 --> 01:44:33,054
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not somebody that's motivated purely by the money and the dollar signs and the trends they see on Wall Street and what they're reading about on the internet and what they're hearing about at conferences and stuff like this.

1220
01:44:34,555 --> 01:44:37,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It's these people that are making the decisions that fuck everything up.

1221
01:44:39,892 --> 01:44:42,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest problem in the gaming industry right now is the boardroom.

1222
01:44:44,115 --> 01:44:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see the Day of Reckoning is very fastly approaching.

1223
01:44:48,298 --> 01:44:49,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, it's not.

1224
01:44:49,919 --> 01:44:51,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the most frustrating thing about it.

1225
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,481
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the boardroom that's paying the price.

1226
01:44:54,702 --> 01:44:57,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that guy left, so fine.

1227
01:44:57,444 --> 01:44:58,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he left.

1228
01:44:58,445 --> 01:45:05,329
[SPEAKER_05]: But all of those people, all of that board that saw that game and signed off on it should be held accountable.

1229
01:45:05,349 --> 01:45:07,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

1230
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:07,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

1231
01:45:08,986 --> 01:45:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I better know which game he's working on over at Microsoft there because... Yeah, and even Microsoft, probably with this report coming out, is kind of looking a little closely, right?

1232
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking a little more closely.

1233
01:45:20,761 --> 01:45:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I saw what you did.

1234
01:45:22,223 --> 01:45:24,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft absolutely should be doing that.

1235
01:45:25,506 --> 01:45:53,926
[SPEAKER_05]: you know if if you know and there could be other factors coming into play that I don't even really want to get into but like it could be something about the environment something about you know like maybe maybe Warner Brothers wasn't clicking for him in a way yeah and Microsoft is and I think that's the benefit of the doubt that should be given but you know Microsoft's going to be watching well and also they give him a little bit more benefit aside from like the procedural stuff where he's taking forever to get sign off on certain things

1236
01:45:54,895 --> 01:45:56,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we don't know

1237
01:45:57,443 --> 01:46:00,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, people don't intend to do their job poorly on purpose.

1238
01:46:00,965 --> 01:46:15,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, there could be other factors, like some of these executives could be pushing, hey, we need to make this a live, you know, we need to push towards this live service type thing, and so that's why he was saying, oh, we need to go in this direction to make this game.

1239
01:46:15,775 --> 01:46:16,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, we don't know that.

1240
01:46:18,197 --> 01:46:20,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he thought that that was just what was best for it.

1241
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:27,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think we need to know the whole picture, but also at the same time, like, I don't care anymore because this game's trash, and I don't,

1242
01:46:28,504 --> 01:46:30,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like watching the fire right now.

1243
01:46:30,224 --> 01:46:33,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it sucks.

1244
01:46:33,246 --> 01:46:35,147
[SPEAKER_04]: There's real people behind it developing it.

1245
01:46:35,667 --> 01:46:38,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks that it's what it is, but also the quality control.

1246
01:46:38,948 --> 01:46:44,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just not something I'd be proud of putting out.

1247
01:46:46,852 --> 01:46:51,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if maybe Warner Brothers is a little more proud of Multiverses.

1248
01:46:51,934 --> 01:46:55,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how it's performing on its kind of re-release that it's going through right now.

1249
01:46:56,195 --> 01:47:04,078
[SPEAKER_05]: But a story came out that really makes it look not great because there is a feature that lets you pay money

1250
01:47:04,478 --> 01:47:12,061
[SPEAKER_05]: to refill your lives during campaign missions, which sounds very mobile gamey, like, you know, a limited time of day or whatever.

1251
01:47:12,962 --> 01:47:16,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, fans kind of spoke up about it and said, this is stupid.

1252
01:47:17,483 --> 01:47:22,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Player First Games came out and said that the feature was a bug and not intended as part of the game.

1253
01:47:23,446 --> 01:47:24,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So they said it was a bug.

1254
01:47:25,307 --> 01:47:32,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually coding this whole thing for sale in the store, having the graphics and the text to go with it, that's a bug?

1255
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:37,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that maybe the fact that it was accessible was a bug.

1256
01:47:38,771 --> 01:47:39,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1257
01:47:39,812 --> 01:47:45,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So that maybe the store was set up for somebody else, like a tester or something, to go in and get it for free?

1258
01:47:46,294 --> 01:47:56,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it might have been set up as an intentional thing that they wanted to come out with the game and decided that it wouldn't fly and then patched it out, but bug.

1259
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:57,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accessible.

1260
01:47:57,757 --> 01:47:58,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

1261
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:01,140
[SPEAKER_01]: That's happened with features of games that were unintended.

1262
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like... I mean...

1263
01:48:04,648 --> 01:48:05,729
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what glitches are for.

1264
01:48:05,849 --> 01:48:07,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt for this.

1265
01:48:08,731 --> 01:48:14,696
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there are tons of things that are fully programmed into a game and are inaccessible, Hot Coffee.

1266
01:48:17,018 --> 01:48:26,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even with what I'm playing on my retro night on Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you can glitch the little trap door right at the beginning of the castle to open and there's a whole section down there.

1267
01:48:26,785 --> 01:48:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not complete, but it's there.

1268
01:48:28,907 --> 01:48:29,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Leads to a save room.

1269
01:48:30,407 --> 01:48:32,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but like, I don't know.

1270
01:48:32,889 --> 01:48:40,095
[SPEAKER_05]: When you use the word bug with those situations, this situation is kind of like, well, but you were going to go down that road.

1271
01:48:40,115 --> 01:48:41,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not really a bug.

1272
01:48:41,256 --> 01:48:45,920
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bad idea that we accidentally left in the game.

1273
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,423
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said the accessibility of it is the bug.

1274
01:48:49,643 --> 01:48:50,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1275
01:48:50,523 --> 01:48:57,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We pushed an unintentional update for features, just like how Assassin's Creed or whatever it was, like showing ads in a menu.

1276
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:25,258
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not a bug it's just that you push the feature out that you didn't intend to actually push out like you create the feature and then it didn't pass that final check of like oh god we shouldn't do this that's too much but someone asked for the feature to be made it's just that the sign off you know when they saw it or when they got to that point they re-evaluated I guess for now

1277
01:49:27,196 --> 01:49:28,397
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1278
01:50:02,549 --> 01:50:09,812
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1279
01:50:10,293 --> 01:50:12,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1280
01:50:13,654 --> 01:50:15,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick this week?

1281
01:50:16,876 --> 01:50:23,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked Street Fighter 3 New Generation as in the first of the Street Fighter 3 games.

1282
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:30,442
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, of course, a fighting game in the Street Fighter series and it was...

1283
01:50:31,514 --> 01:50:36,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really, really... It taught us that Capcom can count to three.

1284
01:50:38,163 --> 01:50:41,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Because before Valve started doing it, Capcom was doing it.

1285
01:50:43,047 --> 01:50:47,853
[SPEAKER_01]: All the bajillion versions of Street Fighter 2 that existed.

1286
01:50:48,553 --> 01:50:52,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, this was originally released in the arcades in 1997.

1287
01:50:55,121 --> 01:51:01,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And the official name on the cabinet is 3, A New Generation of Street Fighters.

1288
01:51:02,991 --> 01:51:17,442
[SPEAKER_01]: It was produced for this CP System 3 hardware, which was CD-ROM based and allowed for a lot more elaborate graphics than the CPS2 that Street Fighter Alpha and the earlier ones were on.

1289
01:51:19,483 --> 01:51:27,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's considered to be a direct sequel to Street Fighter 2 and basically only retained Ken and Yu.

1290
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:56,849
[SPEAKER_01]: and a whole new roster of fighters and a new boss even so we'll get into that in a sec it did have two updates there was Street Fighter 3 Second Impact also in 97 and Street Fighter 3 Third Strike in 1999 which honestly I'm going to say that Third Strike really was the best improvement there was a home version of the game that was released on Dreamcast

1291
01:51:58,049 --> 01:52:04,233
[SPEAKER_01]: in a 2-in-1 that was Street Fighter 3 Double Impact, which also included Second Impact.

1292
01:52:05,353 --> 01:52:10,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we finally got the sequel to all of those, so is Street Fighter 4 in 2008.

1293
01:52:11,796 --> 01:52:14,078
[SPEAKER_01]: So, moving forward, I mean, it is...

1294
01:52:15,418 --> 01:52:18,621
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fighting game like every Capcom fighting game.

1295
01:52:19,301 --> 01:52:28,867
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this introduced a parry system, which I will point out, Samurai Shodown 2 had a parry system before this.

1296
01:52:29,628 --> 01:52:36,713
[SPEAKER_01]: But with this, you can basically deflect an attack without receiving damage, but you really have to be precise.

1297
01:52:37,133 --> 01:52:44,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all remember, was it at EVO that there was the block of every one of Chun-Li's kicks or something?

1298
01:52:45,238 --> 01:52:48,242
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty impressive.

1299
01:52:48,983 --> 01:53:01,838
[SPEAKER_01]: But a really good player can use that to also reduce any damage by special moves in super arts by doing a parry.

1300
01:53:02,618 --> 01:53:05,121
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you have to be really precise about it.

1301
01:53:06,483 --> 01:53:14,753
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that you get is the Super Arts, which are a powerful special move, like a Super Combo, a Street Fighter Turbo, and Alpha.

1302
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:22,322
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be able to select from one of three character-specific Super Arts to use.

1303
01:53:24,263 --> 01:53:28,705
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have a super art gauge that fills up with you doing different moves against people.

1304
01:53:29,265 --> 01:53:46,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you can do that, you can do it when the gauge is filled and depending on what you choose, the length of the super art gauge can vary as well as the amount that you can stock up in that gauge.

1305
01:53:48,228 --> 01:54:13,328
[SPEAKER_01]: that gauge so you can also cancel a special move into a super art taking that from Street Fighter EX it had far more elaborate sprites including multiple stun sprites a turned around state in which when your character is turned around your back faces the opponent after being hit um

1306
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:17,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just all kinds of stuff that went into this.

1307
01:54:20,235 --> 01:54:34,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to skip a little bit up, apparently each character is made up between approximately 700 and 1200 individually drawn frames of animation running at 60 frames per second.

1308
01:54:35,552 --> 01:54:40,194
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the game for me was just always like, it's so fluid.

1309
01:54:40,835 --> 01:54:41,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look at the movement.

1310
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:44,016
[SPEAKER_01]: It was new, you know?

1311
01:54:45,497 --> 01:54:48,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to the characters, of course we have Ryu.

1312
01:54:48,739 --> 01:54:50,339
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants the fight.

1313
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,320
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Ken, who...

1314
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:54,682
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1315
01:55:14,431 --> 01:55:23,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Dudley, who is a gentleman British boxer, and he's trying to win his Jaguar back from Gil.

1316
01:55:24,305 --> 01:55:27,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and I have to say it like it said over there, the Jaguar.

1317
01:55:29,608 --> 01:55:31,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his father's antique convertible.

1318
01:55:31,989 --> 01:55:39,293
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Elena, who I played a lot of, who fights with capoeira, as in all legs and feet.

1319
01:55:41,093 --> 01:55:46,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Ibuki, who is the other one I like to play, who is a ninja girl.

1320
01:55:46,836 --> 01:55:50,117
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Necro, who was a...

1321
01:55:51,838 --> 01:55:54,181
[SPEAKER_01]: A Russian guy who was experimented on.

1322
01:55:55,283 --> 01:56:00,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Oro, who is a hermit who fights with one arm tied behind his back so he doesn't kill his opponents.

1323
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:06,431
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Sean, who is Japanese-Brazilian, and he's like Ken Sakura.

1324
01:56:09,353 --> 01:56:12,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Yoon and Young, the Kung Fu twins.

1325
01:56:14,415 --> 01:56:18,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are basically head swaps with the same moves and everything.

1326
01:56:19,057 --> 01:56:23,139
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Second Impact, they got different movesets.

1327
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was cool.

1328
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Gil, the guy who runs around in...

1329
01:56:29,807 --> 01:56:38,297
[SPEAKER_01]: A white, I don't know if it's supposed to be a hundoshi or just like speedos or something, but yeah.

1330
01:56:38,837 --> 01:56:40,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And he can manipulate fire and ice.

1331
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,483
[SPEAKER_01]: The one side is blue, the other side is red.

1332
01:56:44,972 --> 01:56:52,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it was announced the game was in development during a March 27, 1996 meeting.

1333
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:55,877
[SPEAKER_01]: They said the development took more than two years.

1334
01:56:56,057 --> 01:57:04,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It was first unveiled in 86 at the Japan Machine and Marketing Association tour, and a few minutes of footage were shown.

1335
01:57:07,802 --> 01:57:19,552
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also stated before the show, Mikami, as in Mikami Shinji, stated that it would be possible to convert it to home consoles that were then on the market.

1336
01:57:20,633 --> 01:57:29,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And including the, at the time, upcoming Panasonic M2, which it's one I haven't gotten into a lot on, but it was supposed to be the successor to the 3DO.

1337
01:57:32,862 --> 01:57:44,200
[SPEAKER_01]: IGN witnessed a demo of the game in development for Nintendo 64 and Nintendo 64DD and IGN thought that it might be coming out on that um

1338
01:57:45,402 --> 01:58:04,275
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a rumor, that's what Capcom said and Nintendo actually did delay the launch of the 64DD until December 1999 so Capcom said it might be possible to port Street Fighter 3 to the Sega Saturn if they use the RAM expansion cartridge

1339
01:58:05,977 --> 01:58:16,926
[SPEAKER_01]: However, though, because of this game running on the CBS3 engine and all the stuff that went into it, the only home release that they did was on Dreamcast.

1340
01:58:19,332 --> 01:58:19,992
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and so forth.

1341
01:58:42,108 --> 01:58:45,711
[SPEAKER_01]: and a parry attack mode in Second Impact.

1342
01:58:47,072 --> 01:58:47,753
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in there.

1343
01:58:47,773 --> 01:58:48,874
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a bonus round for that.

1344
01:58:49,154 --> 01:58:55,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And it let you play as Gil and Shin Akuma or Golki in Second Impact.

1345
01:58:56,240 --> 01:59:01,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were the purely, you know, as in the arcade version, purely computer controlled.

1346
01:59:02,265 --> 01:59:06,808
[SPEAKER_01]: The soundtrack was released by First Smile Entertainment on CD.

1347
01:59:06,948 --> 01:59:10,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Third Strike soundtrack was released by Mars Colony.

1348
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:12,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had an arranged soundtrack.

1349
01:59:13,492 --> 01:59:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's stop and talk about the soundtrack for Third Strike.

1350
01:59:16,694 --> 01:59:18,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that it was really good.

1351
01:59:18,515 --> 01:59:21,777
[SPEAKER_01]: The announcer tracks were done by a Canadian rapper called Infinite.

1352
01:59:22,878 --> 01:59:23,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

1353
01:59:24,799 --> 01:59:29,482
[SPEAKER_01]: The music in the game was just this interesting fusion.

1354
01:59:29,522 --> 01:59:32,584
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some drum and bass, you had a little bit of jazz, some hip-hop.

1355
01:59:33,945 --> 01:59:36,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked Ibuki's music.

1356
01:59:36,346 --> 01:59:40,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Ibuki's music to me just sounds like fusion jazz all over and I'm into it.

1357
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:50,655
[SPEAKER_01]: It was re-released in 2018 as part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection for PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

1358
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,841
[SPEAKER_01]: It got decent ratings.

1359
01:59:54,181 --> 01:59:56,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version 31 out of 40.

1360
01:59:57,943 --> 02:00:04,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, the arcade version, of course, did get a lot better reports.

1361
02:00:04,347 --> 02:00:04,507
[SPEAKER_01]: But

1362
02:00:06,152 --> 02:00:10,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just were not completely into Street Fighter 3.

1363
02:00:10,916 --> 02:00:12,157
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of people who were.

1364
02:00:13,158 --> 02:00:14,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really divisive.

1365
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:19,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not enjoy playing it when it first came out.

1366
02:00:19,182 --> 02:00:21,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really didn't care for it.

1367
02:00:22,365 --> 02:00:23,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Ibuki.

1368
02:00:23,186 --> 02:00:23,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Elena.

1369
02:00:25,167 --> 02:00:27,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I played Ryu often.

1370
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:34,255
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it wasn't really there until Third Strike came out.

1371
02:00:35,075 --> 02:01:02,662
[SPEAKER_05]: and who knows maybe Second Impact and Third Strike will be their own classic game at some point but at any rate that's the game Street Fighter 3 New Generation yeah I um this you know for as much Street Fighter 2 as I played this one didn't really land with me at first and I think there's something to be said about how they kind of basically changed up the entire roster uh you know save Ken and Ryu from the very first game and all that I think it was you know kind of harder to just

1372
02:01:03,912 --> 02:01:06,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe get into these new characters at first.

1373
02:01:06,273 --> 02:01:06,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1374
02:01:06,733 --> 02:01:12,475
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot that this game obviously kind of did for fighting games in general.

1375
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:16,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the smoothness you talked about especially is so noticeable with this, right?

1376
02:01:17,116 --> 02:01:19,277
[SPEAKER_05]: In the arcade mode and just how smooth it runs.

1377
02:01:19,417 --> 02:01:20,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks so good.

1378
02:01:21,537 --> 02:01:22,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Really something different.

1379
02:01:22,918 --> 02:01:25,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember we got one in the arcade that I worked at.

1380
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:26,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1381
02:01:28,382 --> 02:01:47,475
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just remember just watching the demo mode for a little bit and then watching people play it and I was like oh my god it's so pretty and all of it being hand drawn animation you know we don't have I mean now when a game does hand drawn animation it's a novelty yeah

1382
02:01:50,949 --> 02:01:56,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says aren't Street Fighter games like Star Trek movies only the even numbers are good?

1383
02:01:57,813 --> 02:01:59,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, Third Strike was great.

1384
02:01:59,353 --> 02:02:04,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I was gonna say, you know, even the third Star Trek movie has its fans.

1385
02:02:05,597 --> 02:02:09,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what was funky to me is that when Chun-Li

1386
02:02:10,419 --> 02:02:12,180
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1387
02:02:27,406 --> 02:02:34,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and OrangeRite kind of points out like it was okay for the time and then Third Strike was well beloved and Five, Street Fighter V got better.

1388
02:02:34,189 --> 02:02:40,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like maybe the odd ones kind of get better with age, although the original is kind of just an anomaly in a way.

1389
02:02:40,531 --> 02:02:42,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we don't talk about the first Street Fighter game really.

1390
02:02:43,152 --> 02:02:45,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like Street Fighter 4 better than 3 and 5.

1391
02:02:46,653 --> 02:02:47,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, 4 is great.

1392
02:02:48,434 --> 02:02:56,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, so Chun-Li essentially, all those people that skip leg day, she makes up for their skipped leg days by taking extra leg day.

1393
02:02:57,137 --> 02:02:58,618
[SPEAKER_01]: She absorbed their leg day.

1394
02:02:58,858 --> 02:03:00,038
[SPEAKER_04]: She absorbed all their leg days.

1395
02:03:00,058 --> 02:03:04,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone was left with very spindly, yet still somehow muscular thighs.

1396
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chun-Li's like, look at all of this.

1397
02:03:09,513 --> 02:03:11,854
[SPEAKER_04]: She put all of her stat points into thighs.

1398
02:03:12,514 --> 02:03:13,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that's it.

1399
02:03:14,155 --> 02:03:16,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Your classic game of the week, Street Fighter 3.

1400
02:03:17,175 --> 02:03:24,238
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a 10 in Charisma, a 15 in Dexterity, and a 57 in thigh.

1401
02:03:25,438 --> 02:03:31,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's cover some other headlines real quick in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

1402
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:31,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1403
02:03:32,915 --> 02:03:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so there's some fun mods out there for games that you probably shouldn't be playing on your PC, but you can.

1404
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:57,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been a team of fans have been working to port the Jak games to PC, and now they've added a mod that you'll be able to use on this ported version to play multiplayer in Jak and Daxter.

1405
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cool, because you can't do that.

1406
02:04:02,327 --> 02:04:11,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they have this mod called Team Runs, and it's Jak and Daxter Online, I guess.

1407
02:04:12,802 --> 02:04:37,494
[SPEAKER_04]: and yeah you can play a full co-op uh through the campaign and I they even have in-game timers splits automatic lead boards submissions for like different speed running tools including with that um I don't know how many players total they can do but they had a lot of players in one of the screenshots there's at least four players I saw during their like kind of trailer showcasing this um

1408
02:04:38,595 --> 02:04:39,115
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1409
02:04:39,536 --> 02:04:42,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope it doesn't get really fast.

1410
02:04:43,478 --> 02:04:51,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hear that game industry, you know, what was it?

1411
02:04:52,963 --> 02:04:53,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gosh.

1412
02:04:54,244 --> 02:04:55,484
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I've already forgotten about them.

1413
02:04:55,664 --> 02:04:56,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The ESA.

1414
02:04:56,485 --> 02:05:01,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear that ESA's out there and they're hungry for some article points?

1415
02:05:01,888 --> 02:05:05,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1416
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:06,490
[SPEAKER_04]: They're seeking relevancy.

1417
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:16,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there's a mysterious banana clicking game on Steam that really has no point aside from clicking a banana and the number goes up.

1418
02:05:16,616 --> 02:05:18,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wouldn't say it doesn't have a point.

1419
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wasn't that the plot of Cookie Clicker?

1420
02:05:21,688 --> 02:05:25,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of, but Cookie Creator had some actual progression in it.

1421
02:05:25,732 --> 02:05:28,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can unlock the grandmas, and there's the whole weird elders thing.

1422
02:05:28,774 --> 02:05:31,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the whole demon circle grandma, yeah.

1423
02:05:31,517 --> 02:05:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas this is just, you click a banana, and apparently it does unlock different achievements as well.

1424
02:05:39,063 --> 02:05:46,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think, though, one of the things that maybe are keeping people doing it is it also unlocks bananas that you can sell on the marketplace.

1425
02:05:47,391 --> 02:05:47,531
Yeah.

1426
02:05:47,811 --> 02:05:57,778
[SPEAKER_04]: so maybe that's what it is that people are selling the bananas and making money I don't know but why?

1427
02:06:01,161 --> 02:06:06,265
[SPEAKER_04]: cuz cuz it's a banana and there's 100,000 people playing it 137,817 why?

1428
02:06:06,565 --> 02:06:14,591
[SPEAKER_04]: because we love bananas I like a good banana but I don't want to cook a banana all day

1429
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:30,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I would eat a banana all day though We don't need to know about what you do in private, Rob You and your banana eating, I swear Nasty, nasty Bananas are good food Alright, what do you have?

1430
02:06:30,638 --> 02:06:31,719
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think I was talking about?

1431
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:33,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about bananas Sure you were.

1432
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:37,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us in gaming?

1433
02:06:38,323 --> 02:06:44,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Volgar The Viking 2 has been announced for Switch I've never played Volgar The Viking 1

1434
02:06:45,737 --> 02:06:55,081
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a sequel to a side-scrolling platformer that has new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a new soundtrack.

1435
02:06:55,161 --> 02:06:57,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be available August 6, 2024.

1436
02:07:01,204 --> 02:07:05,726
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be very precise when you're playing the game.

1437
02:07:07,267 --> 02:07:12,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very just like classic difficulty.

1438
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:14,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And

1439
02:07:16,801 --> 02:07:18,282
[SPEAKER_01]: He's old, apparently.

1440
02:07:18,963 --> 02:07:20,344
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep talking about him being old.

1441
02:07:21,885 --> 02:07:32,414
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to use magical power-ups and you have different bosses and it says that they are so big and ugly they're just begging to have their heads chopped off.

1442
02:07:34,676 --> 02:07:39,879
[SPEAKER_01]: and orchestral soundtrack speed running tools including an on-screen timer and no HUD mode.

1443
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,962
[SPEAKER_01]: You have six different endings depending on how you play.

1444
02:07:45,583 --> 02:07:49,126
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a practical mode and multiple profile save options.

1445
02:07:49,686 --> 02:07:52,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You have buckets of blood and bone explosions.

1446
02:07:52,868 --> 02:07:58,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last key feature on the list, Rob, Loki, loincloths.

1447
02:07:59,233 --> 02:08:00,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, you have my attention.

1448
02:08:01,181 --> 02:08:03,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing says awesome game like a loincloth.

1449
02:08:04,163 --> 02:08:08,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I love to store my bananas in a loincloth before I eat them for lunch.

1450
02:08:10,747 --> 02:08:12,489
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting place to store a banana.

1451
02:08:13,509 --> 02:08:13,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?

1452
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:16,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I think bananas just need to be left in the sun to ripen.

1453
02:08:19,753 --> 02:08:20,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in Europe.

1454
02:08:21,895 --> 02:08:25,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's allowed.

1455
02:08:25,217 --> 02:08:27,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about bananas.

1456
02:08:27,578 --> 02:08:29,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

1457
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:36,466
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, what I'm talking about is a great thing for the industry, another labor agreement, another union, if you will.

1458
02:08:37,006 --> 02:08:44,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft and the CWA, the Communication Workers of America, they have reached a labor neutrality agreement for ZeniMax workers.

1459
02:08:44,933 --> 02:08:52,240
[SPEAKER_05]: This is similar to the 2022 deal that covered Activision Blizzard employees, and that went into effect in April of this year.

1460
02:08:53,221 --> 02:08:55,383
[SPEAKER_05]: A senior quality assurance tester said,

1461
02:08:55,763 --> 02:09:06,067
[SPEAKER_05]: said in a CWA press release, their name is Paige Branson, said, thousands of our ZeniMax coworkers now have a free and fair path to organize together for better working conditions.

1462
02:09:07,808 --> 02:09:13,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the CWA mentions that Microsoft will take a neutral approach when employees express interest in joining the union.

1463
02:09:13,630 --> 02:09:22,954
[SPEAKER_05]: The workers can communicate with their peers and union reps about membership, and that can be done in, quote, a way that encourages information sharing and avoids business disruptions.

1464
02:09:23,494 --> 02:09:25,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So, neat.

1465
02:09:26,414 --> 02:09:27,034
[SPEAKER_05]: GameTrailersTheShow Yes Yes

1466
02:09:52,263 --> 02:09:54,365

[SPEAKER_05]: But Japan gets a PlayStation 5 version gold edition this week.

1479

[SPEAKER_05]: How about Europe, DarkSakura?

1480
02:11:43,987 --> 02:11:44,768

[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation on the 14th we have Retropolis 2 Never Say Goodbye and also on the 14th for PlayStation Switch and Xbox we have Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance alright that's it we have just a few more stories for you here and then we're going to get to the listener round table I think we have an email tonight and maybe we'll get a call or two but first we have a few more stories so let's go to Loki

1485
02:12:26,431 --> 02:12:33,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so there is a big campaign going on to try to fix or save Team Fortress 2.

1486
02:12:35,256 --> 02:12:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, there's a big bot problem in the game, and now over 200,000 fans have basically signed the petition to try to get Valve to actually do something with this.

1487
02:12:50,824 --> 02:12:54,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they had that whole, hey, we hear you guys.

1488
02:12:56,211 --> 02:13:24,766
[SPEAKER_04]: but that was like we hear you and we're doing nothing about it that was like over a year ago something like that and then of course now Team Fortress 2 has received over 25,000 negative reviews and now has dropped to mostly negative as far as the reviews go for the game so much for Team Fortress 3 yeah I guess but yeah Valve has been silent so far about

1489
02:13:25,672 --> 02:13:27,453
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that they're doing.

1490
02:13:27,573 --> 02:13:33,555
[SPEAKER_04]: They just need to update their anti-cheat or something so that it's not so easy for these people to run bots.

1491
02:13:34,356 --> 02:13:38,677
[SPEAKER_01]: If their anti-cheat, though, is only on its second iteration, they can't upgrade it, you know?

1492
02:13:38,957 --> 02:13:40,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1493
02:13:40,278 --> 02:13:45,720
[SPEAKER_05]: As SJ100Matt says in chat, we hear you, but in order to fix it, we have to type the number three, and we can't do that.

1494
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:48,701
Yeah.

1495
02:13:49,282 --> 02:13:49,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Precisely.

1496
02:13:49,822 --> 02:13:50,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1497
02:13:50,603 --> 02:13:58,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, well, this is one of those, like, I can't believe we're living in the year 2024, but here we are kind of stories.

1498
02:13:58,167 --> 02:14:04,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is that IKEA is now hiring people, but it's not for what you think.

1499
02:14:04,931 --> 02:14:09,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the game, I'm going to use a quote of fingers, the game Roblox.

1500
02:14:09,134 --> 02:14:12,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Loki knows this game because his kids participate in Roblox, right?

1501
02:14:12,956 --> 02:14:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1502
02:14:13,816 --> 02:14:20,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this is a multi-platform, multiplayer game, and you use tools to create, play, and share games and experiences.

1503
02:14:20,302 --> 02:14:24,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like what happens when ZZT becomes dystopian and three-dimensional.

1504
02:14:25,386 --> 02:14:27,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be an accurate description of Roblox?

1505
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:31,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sort of.

1506
02:14:32,042 --> 02:14:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if Second Life was more Duplo, I guess, or something like that.

1507
02:14:39,367 --> 02:14:39,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1508
02:14:39,768 --> 02:14:47,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now maybe Second Life can pay you a little bit because Ikea is going into Roblox and they are making a digital store.

1509
02:14:48,134 --> 02:14:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: This store will be staffed by real humans.

1510
02:14:52,036 --> 02:14:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of people are kind of dunking on this, but there's also part of me that's like,

1511
02:14:58,741 --> 02:15:26,523
[SPEAKER_04]: at least it's not AI like I kind of feel like we should sort of celebrate that they didn't just put AI bots in there to do that which honestly is kind of you know what you'd see most they're going to probably have to at some point because like think about it okay like this isn't gonna last so now now they've essentially told the universe and I mean the universe hey guys we we're gonna be hiring some people today we're gonna run into this they're gonna pay you to do this but

1512
02:15:27,981 --> 02:15:37,887
[SPEAKER_04]: these are real people you can interact with please don't troll them you are going to get so many people just

1513
02:15:38,823 --> 02:15:41,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine doing your job?

1514
02:15:41,484 --> 02:15:42,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's a remote job.

1515
02:16:04,423 --> 02:16:04,903
[SPEAKER_04]: All day long.

1516
02:16:05,303 --> 02:16:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can you imagine that?

1517
02:16:06,503 --> 02:16:09,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a thrilling good time.

1518
02:16:09,444 --> 02:16:10,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, here's the deal.

1519
02:16:10,984 --> 02:16:16,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So IKEA is hiring 10 lucky candidates to work in the digital Roblox store.

1520
02:16:16,245 --> 02:16:17,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You will get paid.

1521
02:16:17,525 --> 02:16:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You get what equates to $16.82 is an hourly rate.

1522
02:16:23,206 --> 02:16:26,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it's a remote job because, yeah, it's in a video game.

1523
02:16:27,287 --> 02:16:31,848
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be 18 or older and you must live in the UK because that's where these jobs are based.

1524
02:16:32,288 --> 02:16:32,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1525
02:17:03,115 --> 02:17:05,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to eat meatballs in front of customers.

1526
02:17:06,917 --> 02:17:07,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Not serve them.

1527
02:17:08,377 --> 02:17:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're thinking about applying, here are some very serious questions that they ask you on the application that you must submit.

1528
02:17:17,461 --> 02:17:19,862
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about being turned into pixels?

1529
02:17:20,962 --> 02:17:25,544
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were pixelated... How did you feel about the Adam Sandler movie, Pixels?

1530
02:17:26,525 --> 02:17:27,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would you be and why?

1531
02:17:28,445 --> 02:17:31,967
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do if we ran out of pixelated hot dogs in our bistro?

1532
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:39,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Login to Shell and type fdisk.

1533
02:17:43,455 --> 02:17:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear what you did there.

1534
02:17:45,638 --> 02:17:48,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be if we ran out of big slated hot dogs.

1535
02:17:48,941 --> 02:17:51,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd burn this store to the ground.

1536
02:17:55,889 --> 02:17:56,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should apply.

1537
02:17:58,723 --> 02:18:00,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rob, apply!

1538
02:18:00,244 --> 02:18:02,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital goods are not finite.

1539
02:18:02,266 --> 02:18:10,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't live in the UK, but if I did, I would apply as- Dear friends in the UK, infiltrate Roblox through Ikea.

1540
02:18:10,554 --> 02:18:11,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I'd do.

1541
02:18:11,274 --> 02:18:12,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I would apply as a Spice Girl.

1542
02:18:12,956 --> 02:18:14,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be Meatball Spice.

1543
02:18:15,418 --> 02:18:16,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would apply for this job.

1544
02:18:16,659 --> 02:18:18,701
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Rob, we already know you would be Pumpkin Spice.

1545
02:18:20,683 --> 02:18:21,604
[SPEAKER_05]: But not at Ikea.

1546
02:18:21,844 --> 02:18:22,785
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't work at Ikea.

1547
02:18:22,805 --> 02:18:23,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to be Meatball Spice.

1548
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:26,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1549
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,220
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds awful.

1550
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:28,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It does sound awful.

1551
02:18:28,821 --> 02:18:29,121
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1552
02:18:30,401 --> 02:18:32,662
[SPEAKER_05]: In a moment, we're going to get to the list of roundtable here.

1553
02:18:32,802 --> 02:18:42,584
[SPEAKER_05]: But even though it's not a story we have listed on the side, DarkSakura, I know you have some things to say about another thing going on in the industry because it really impacts a game you have given a lot of time and attention to, right?

1554
02:18:43,284 --> 02:18:43,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1555
02:18:43,644 --> 02:18:44,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, both of us have.

1556
02:18:44,684 --> 02:18:45,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1557
02:18:45,344 --> 02:18:48,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I played it once this week and then remembered why I don't play.

1558
02:18:50,912 --> 02:18:59,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Behavior Interactive had laid off up to 95 workers in Montreal, mostly in Montreal.

1559
02:19:00,359 --> 02:19:05,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they laid off people earlier in the year as well, but...

1560
02:19:08,171 --> 02:19:19,454
[SPEAKER_01]: What was really sus about the whole thing is that this comes after they said that they were going to be more transparent and interactive with the community.

1561
02:19:20,134 --> 02:19:29,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people that they laid off were people who were in social media marketing and fan engagement.

1562
02:19:32,415 --> 02:19:50,887
[SPEAKER_01]: and that just seems really suspicious to me and then later on in the day after that happened a lot of the employees came out and said you know that had been interacting with us for you know a few years now they came out and said yeah it's true this happened we can't talk about it you know and

1563
02:19:52,168 --> 02:19:52,869
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

1564
02:20:08,484 --> 02:20:10,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to find it on the Wayback Machine and saved it.

1565
02:20:12,946 --> 02:20:22,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, is that they also just released the Dungeons & Dragons chapter a day early on Monday and did the layoffs on the Tuesday after.

1566
02:20:24,691 --> 02:20:34,815
[SPEAKER_01]: So... I... It's just all very... The optics on it are shit.

1567
02:20:35,295 --> 02:20:35,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1568
02:20:35,796 --> 02:20:45,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, laying off people anyway is bad, but this particular group, in light of other statements that they've said and they're saying that

1569
02:20:48,545 --> 02:20:56,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they attributed it to pandemic overspending, but the developers are also saying that there are many, many more reasons.

1570
02:20:58,511 --> 02:21:03,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really, a lot of people internally are also pissed about it too.

1571
02:21:04,374 --> 02:21:13,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they said that they're trying to restructure the way that they do things and blah, blah, corporate speak.

1572
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:39,313
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean this also comes after you know they acquired Fly Studio in 2023 they got Suck Money Studio and Code Glue and had a new studio in Cornwall and then in 2022 they also acquired Midwinter Entertainment and opened up a Toronto office so I

1573
02:21:42,458 --> 02:21:42,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1574
02:21:43,779 --> 02:21:46,162
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing just leaves me sour.

1575
02:21:46,563 --> 02:21:53,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's people who are like, well, I'm not going to buy anything else from them again.

1576
02:21:53,971 --> 02:21:58,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And my whole thing is, I don't want to lose anyone else there.

1577
02:21:59,899 --> 02:22:00,179
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

1578
02:22:02,185 --> 02:22:29,512
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're bringing I mean it seems to me that I'd have to I mean I don't have access to stockholder reports clearly but I would love to see how much money that they're making on Dead by Daylight or how many people have actually left the game over you know the some of the toxic environment in game although that has ways of reporting that has gotten better and I've seen it acted on from my own reports because I report I report people I'll just say it right now if people are shits I'll report them you know

1579
02:22:32,242 --> 02:22:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it just leaves me feeling really sour about it.

1580
02:22:38,548 --> 02:22:41,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since they also have the Frank Stone game coming out.

1581
02:22:42,452 --> 02:22:44,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Behavior does a lot more than just Dead by Daylight, right?

1582
02:22:44,754 --> 02:22:47,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they also had the, what was it called, Meet Your Maker or whatever it was called?

1583
02:22:47,697 --> 02:22:52,241
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Meet Your Maker, there's Islands of Insight, which I've been playing some because I got the game.

1584
02:22:53,422 --> 02:22:55,204
[SPEAKER_01]: There is Project T.

1585
02:22:56,445 --> 02:22:57,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it's called.

1586
02:22:57,966 --> 02:22:59,687
[SPEAKER_01]: They put it open.

1587
02:23:00,627 --> 02:23:02,789
[SPEAKER_01]: The beta call was put out there for everybody.

1588
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:09,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're working with... Why can't I remember the name of the studio?

1589
02:23:12,474 --> 02:23:13,835
[SPEAKER_01]: For doing the casting of Frank Stone.

1590
02:23:14,896 --> 02:23:16,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the ones that made Until Dawn, right?

1591
02:23:16,997 --> 02:23:17,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1592
02:23:17,977 --> 02:23:18,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1593
02:23:18,898 --> 02:23:19,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1594
02:23:21,039 --> 02:23:22,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just... I don't know.

1595
02:23:23,641 --> 02:23:25,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a word for how it feels.

1596
02:23:26,412 --> 02:23:29,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, here's the thing to me is this seems very poorly timed.

1597
02:23:29,354 --> 02:23:32,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, this might just be my own personal perception of everything.

1598
02:23:33,056 --> 02:23:39,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crappy news, but I'm just saying it's extremely poorly timed with the release of the Vecna chapter.

1599
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:43,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, from my perspective, I feel like half of the people that I watch...

1600
02:23:45,004 --> 02:23:45,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, yeah.

1601
02:23:45,805 --> 02:23:49,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Half of the people I watch that usually play Dead by Daylight are playing something else this week.

1602
02:23:49,888 --> 02:24:05,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, Jamie, I know you have an aversion to the subject matter of this game, but it has to be said that I see a lot of people that are usually playing Dead by Daylight now playing Killer Clowns from Outer Space, which is from the makers of the Friday the 13th game, who appear to, and I don't know if this is a game, but they appear to have...

1603
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse There's people who don't know it's a movie

1604
02:24:35,608 --> 02:24:36,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1605
02:24:36,829 --> 02:24:39,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny because I hosted a screening of that movie some time ago.

1606
02:24:39,051 --> 02:24:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like what people like about that game is that it is very Friday the 13th.

1607
02:24:45,537 --> 02:24:49,660
[SPEAKER_05]: For people that enjoyed that game, there's a lot of that they kind of see in this particular game.

1608
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:51,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting to me.

1609
02:24:52,002 --> 02:24:55,145
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, the timing, not great for behavior.

1610
02:24:55,485 --> 02:25:01,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's like, meanwhile, while you're laying off your relations team for the streaming community...

1611
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:26,344
[SPEAKER_01]: another relations team is very much engaging the streamer community to get them to play their game instead so it's almost like you're saying here take our customers that exactly and we rely I mean the bet the thing that I super loved about behavior were their social content managers it was one of the few things that was uh that had me going back and checking the twat site mm-hmm

1612
02:25:27,128 --> 02:25:27,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1613
02:25:27,709 --> 02:25:27,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1614
02:25:53,782 --> 02:25:54,103
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1615
02:25:54,583 --> 02:26:00,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're going to move on and go to the listener roundtable and interact with you all who reach out to us each week.

1616
02:26:01,387 --> 02:26:02,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you like to email us.

1617
02:26:02,628 --> 02:26:03,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to get emails.

1618
02:26:03,509 --> 02:26:06,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Participate at OrangeLondrainer.com is the email address.

1619
02:26:07,131 --> 02:26:08,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe we got one email.

1620
02:26:08,732 --> 02:26:09,433
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to get to it.

1621
02:26:10,333 --> 02:26:10,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one.

1622
02:26:11,714 --> 02:26:12,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, LR.

1623
02:26:12,655 --> 02:26:20,300
[SPEAKER_01]: On the last episode, you covered Sony's recent state of play and mentioned that Astro Bot was finally getting a starring role in a full-length single-player PlayStation game.

1624
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,982
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, that already happened five years ago.

1625
02:26:24,286 --> 02:26:26,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it said that y'all forgot about Astro Bot Rescue Mission.

1626
02:26:27,848 --> 02:26:31,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say I forgot about it because I don't think I ever played it.

1627
02:26:31,130 --> 02:26:40,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say I swore this came up but I'm not going to go back and listen just to see what did I say.

1628
02:26:41,015 --> 02:26:45,878
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I'm well aware of the Astro Bot game that PS5 launched with and I think they had a VR game as well.

1629
02:26:46,799 --> 02:26:49,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep reading because there's more.

1630
02:26:51,641 --> 02:27:03,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the 2018 exclusive that not only served as one of the very best PlayStation VR games, but also remains one of the best VR games ever made on any platform, sporting a 90 average on Metacritic.

1631
02:27:04,047 --> 02:27:06,389
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 100% designed around the technology.

1632
02:27:06,849 --> 02:27:12,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Some segments require that you look through the level literally, physically looking through the level.

1633
02:27:12,972 --> 02:27:15,713
[SPEAKER_01]: HomeWalls can be broken by bashing them with your head.

1634
02:27:16,693 --> 02:27:27,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite this, the way the game has you remotely controlling Astro means that the camera works very thoughtfully, resulting in a far smaller chance of motion sickness than in other games.

1635
02:27:27,737 --> 02:27:32,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pure joy to play, and if you have a PlayStation VR One headset, trust me when I say...

1636
02:27:32,918 --> 02:27:46,569
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to play it it was basically VR Super Mario 64 moment if you really have the stomach for VR I would go so far as to say it's worth considering buying the headset just to play it it's really really really good um I

1637
02:27:48,004 --> 02:27:48,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a no for me.

1638
02:27:49,786 --> 02:27:50,387
[SPEAKER_05]: For obvious reasons.

1639
02:27:50,487 --> 02:27:51,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I have played it.

1640
02:27:51,208 --> 02:27:51,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

1641
02:27:51,929 --> 02:27:53,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I would say it's the system seller.

1642
02:27:53,972 --> 02:27:57,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, again, Tetris Effect I think is probably the best VR game.

1643
02:27:57,537 --> 02:28:00,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was good.

1644
02:28:00,621 --> 02:28:01,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, yeah.

1645
02:28:01,682 --> 02:28:02,944
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually feel, and I think

1646
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:04,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I kind of agree with what Bobby's saying in chat.

1647
02:28:05,145 --> 02:28:05,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it.

1648
02:28:05,765 --> 02:28:12,849
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun and really well made, but I don't remember it having the PlayStation fan service that pushed Astro Bot even better, in my humble opinion.

1649
02:28:13,229 --> 02:28:16,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, you kind of say that it felt like Super Mario 64 in VR.

1650
02:28:17,271 --> 02:28:23,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the PlayStation 5 Astro Bot pack-in game, whatever you want to call it, felt like it was Super Mario 64.

1651
02:28:23,955 --> 02:28:24,335
[SPEAKER_05]: But like...

1652
02:28:24,915 --> 02:28:26,518
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation's version of it.

1653
02:28:26,538 --> 02:28:28,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was really adorable.

1654
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:32,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious to see what's going to happen when they want to charge people $70 for it.

1655
02:28:33,168 --> 02:28:34,530
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it stands to do alright.

1656
02:28:35,723 --> 02:28:42,287
[SPEAKER_01]: The announcement of the new Astro Bot game came for PS5 is bittersweet for folks like me who loved Astro Bot Rescue Mission.

1657
02:28:42,927 --> 02:28:45,449
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is stuck on PlayStation VR 1.

1658
02:28:45,769 --> 02:28:58,296
[SPEAKER_01]: No PSVR 2 port has been announced, and the new Astro Bot game sequel coming soon doesn't have any VR support at all, which basically confirms that there is zero chance of either a remaster or a sequel.

1659
02:28:58,777 --> 02:29:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine a Super Mario 64...

1660
02:29:01,298 --> 02:29:06,942
[SPEAKER_01]: happened and then after that Nintendo said, nah, 3D Mario was a bad idea and just put out 2D games forever after that.

1661
02:29:07,423 --> 02:29:10,805
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have never had Sunshine, Galaxy, 3D Land, 3D World, or Odyssey.

1662
02:29:11,345 --> 02:29:12,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that have been a shame?

1663
02:29:12,767 --> 02:29:14,768
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this feels like and it sucks.

1664
02:29:15,649 --> 02:29:16,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway...

1665
02:29:19,321 --> 02:29:31,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I want to end this on a positive note by saying that I'll be showing the almost finished version of Super Duper Multitasking later this month at Too Many Games convention in Oaks, PA from June 28th through June 30th.

1666
02:29:31,807 --> 02:29:35,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a dance pad with me so you can try workout mode.

1667
02:29:35,489 --> 02:29:36,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Not kidding, even a little bit.

1668
02:29:37,730 --> 02:29:44,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Check near the back corner of the Indie Showcase and look for the big nose glasses wearing bald spotted doofus.

1669
02:29:44,414 --> 02:29:44,994
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be me.

1670
02:29:45,494 --> 02:29:46,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope to see some of you there.

1671
02:29:46,975 --> 02:29:47,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great week.

1672
02:29:47,996 --> 02:29:48,616
[SPEAKER_01]: ErinYYR

1673
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:55,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited for updates to Super Multitasking, and I hope you have a great show and get the game in front of more people.

1674
02:29:56,614 --> 02:29:58,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, that Mario comparison's a stretch, though.

1675
02:29:58,995 --> 02:30:08,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, because I, like, honestly, when you say that, I'm like, if that means they make more 2D Mario games as a result, I'm actually okay with that.

1676
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I did like Galaxy a lot, and I liked Odyssey.

1677
02:30:11,602 --> 02:30:15,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hold Mario 64 in the same holy text a lot of people do.

1678
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:26,346
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think maybe being a gamer of a certain age where I played the shit out of Mario World, Mario Brothers 3, I was actually kind of annoyed with the 3D transition of Mario.

1679
02:30:28,807 --> 02:30:35,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm older than you, and Mario 64 had a big shining spot in my heart.

1680
02:30:36,429 --> 02:30:36,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

1681
02:30:37,605 --> 02:31:02,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and I played that game together and that was the fun thing is that we could take turns on different levels and it would be if it's the same area it would be a different experience I mean that game was really among the pinnacles I think of the Mario series for me and there's a lot of people that feel that way and there's other people that don't and that's gaming opinions

1682
02:31:03,297 --> 02:31:20,949
[SPEAKER_01]: so I mean but just but it's the same thing with this game then you know I mean I I have a hard time voicing a negative opinion about something someone loves just because I don't want to you know rub their feathers the wrong way um

1683
02:31:23,368 --> 02:31:30,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that when I say YYR that I am very glad that you loved it that much.

1684
02:31:30,311 --> 02:31:30,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I really am.

1685
02:31:30,971 --> 02:31:33,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that it gave you that level of entertainment.

1686
02:31:33,652 --> 02:31:38,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it didn't for everybody else, but I am glad that you have that fondness for it and can still remember it fondly.

1687
02:31:38,754 --> 02:31:39,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1688
02:31:39,815 --> 02:31:42,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying I disliked Astro by any means.

1689
02:31:42,636 --> 02:31:43,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

1690
02:31:43,456 --> 02:31:48,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't hold it in quite the high regard, which is fine, that Aaron does.

1691
02:31:49,358 --> 02:31:50,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah.

1692
02:31:50,999 --> 02:31:51,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't.

1693
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:53,800
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't a bad game at all.

1694
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:56,501
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the PS5 game, I thought was great.

1695
02:31:57,022 --> 02:31:58,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very logical thing.

1696
02:31:58,562 --> 02:32:10,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And kind of what I said on last week's show is that, yeah, Sony kind of needs... Now, the comparison to Mario I will make is that Mario is a very family-friendly sort of icon, mascot for Nintendo.

1697
02:32:10,668 --> 02:32:18,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was kind of saying on the show last week, especially since Sony is canned media molecule, I don't see LittleBigPlanet and Sackboy being able to kind of carry that.

1698
02:32:18,311 --> 02:32:20,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So Astro Bot, I guess, is going to carry that.

1699
02:32:20,653 --> 02:32:21,198
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that's fine.

1700
02:32:25,475 --> 02:32:27,477
[SPEAKER_05]: do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

1701
02:32:27,497 --> 02:32:27,537
[SPEAKER_05]: um

1702
02:32:55,374 --> 02:32:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

1703
02:32:55,995 --> 02:33:00,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at different games that were part of that PC gaming showcase.

1704
02:33:00,138 --> 02:33:01,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that looked really awesome.

1705
02:33:02,119 --> 02:33:04,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I mentioned that one, Unbeatable.

1706
02:33:04,761 --> 02:33:06,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted the trailer in Discord.

1707
02:33:07,423 --> 02:33:08,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Streets of Rogue is another good one.

1708
02:33:09,305 --> 02:33:13,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks similar to... Oh gosh.

1709
02:33:13,588 --> 02:33:15,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the early Grand Theft Auto games, but...

1710
02:33:16,963 --> 02:33:18,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Fumes Vigilante 8 Twisted Metal

1711
02:33:42,847 --> 02:34:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: but the art style here is basically low poly low resolution textures and stuff but it's open world and it's like a car combat game with like guns and stuff so that's something that looks pretty awesome another one Airframe Ultra which looks like a cross between Jet Moto and like an arena shooter game so almost like Jet Moto and Twisted Metal which is pretty cool um

1712
02:34:10,754 --> 02:34:18,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And then yeah, I did want to mention that Phil Spencer also made comments regarding the layoffs at Microsoft.

1713
02:34:19,738 --> 02:34:22,140
[SPEAKER_04]: His comments aren't so great, but understandable.

1714
02:34:22,841 --> 02:34:31,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking to IGN's Ryan McCaffrey, he basically said, the closure of any team is obviously hard on the individuals.

1715
02:34:31,729 --> 02:34:32,709
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hard on the teams.

1716
02:34:33,230 --> 02:34:40,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been talking publicly about this because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals.

1717
02:34:40,756 --> 02:34:45,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure that

1718
02:34:46,321 --> 02:34:55,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Through Severance and other things that we're doing, I think for the individuals on the team, it's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR, it's about those teams.

1719
02:34:56,167 --> 02:35:02,111
[SPEAKER_04]: In the end, I've said it over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow.

1720
02:35:02,171 --> 02:35:09,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly aren't the decisions I love, but the decisions that somebody needs to make.

1721
02:35:09,972 --> 02:35:12,294
[SPEAKER_04]: We will continue to go forward.

1722
02:35:12,334 --> 02:35:21,563
[SPEAKER_04]: We will continue to invest in what we're trying to do with Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did.

1723
02:35:23,442 --> 02:35:24,182
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1724
02:35:47,297 --> 02:36:12,485
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh at the start of that answer I was kind of going okay Phil Spencer's basically dancing the same thing he didn't want to do this but he had to but then he kind of takes a little more ownership for it towards the end so I I wonder if he was in the room with the board when this type of thing was made but um I again you know there's a lot of people here to look at that and go well then what what sacrifice are you gonna make Phil Spencer what sacrifice are you making

1725
02:36:16,311 --> 02:36:17,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirp, chirp, tweet, tweet.

1726
02:36:18,132 --> 02:36:18,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1727
02:36:21,234 --> 02:36:21,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

1728
02:36:21,754 --> 02:36:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I had.

1729
02:36:22,375 --> 02:36:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you got.

1730
02:36:23,876 --> 02:36:26,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what a note to end on.

1731
02:36:26,417 --> 02:36:30,079
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that, I think we are going to wrap it up and call it a show for the night.

1732
02:36:30,119 --> 02:36:34,422
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a lot, a lot of games that we're talking about here and a lot more to come.

1733
02:36:34,562 --> 02:36:36,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess some more stuff this week, right?

1734
02:36:36,203 --> 02:36:37,884
[SPEAKER_05]: We know Ubisoft's got a thing.

1735
02:36:37,904 --> 02:36:39,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody else has a thing tomorrow, right?

1736
02:36:39,825 --> 02:36:40,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Ubisoft.

1737
02:36:41,126 --> 02:36:42,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Forward is tomorrow.

1738
02:36:42,447 --> 02:36:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1739
02:36:44,013 --> 02:37:05,622
[SPEAKER_04]: yay uh no actually I mean no yay that's kind of where I'm at like Assassin's Creed I'm over it they're just not the company for me anymore I don't know I used to be really into you know Far Cry that's before all the Far Cries have literally been like the same yeah I gotcha

1740
02:37:06,772 --> 02:37:18,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we will be back in seven days to talk about all of the news that comes up with all the other announcements this week with the, who knows, Nintendo might surprise us, but at the same time, don't hold your breath.

1741
02:37:19,238 --> 02:37:20,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we can always dream.

1742
02:37:21,159 --> 02:37:27,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, before we wrap up, I want to thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and supporting us because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1743
02:37:28,363 --> 02:37:31,344
[SPEAKER_05]: but we need more voices to put out on air so tell a friend or two about the show.

1744
02:37:31,384 --> 02:37:32,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Help us spread the word.

1745
02:37:32,445 --> 02:37:36,627
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify.

1746
02:37:36,747 --> 02:37:38,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It all goes a very long way.

1747
02:37:38,388 --> 02:37:39,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1748
02:37:40,508 --> 02:37:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get final thoughts.

1749
02:37:41,529 --> 02:37:42,709
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

1750
02:37:45,130 --> 02:37:46,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long I'm going to play.

1751
02:37:46,551 --> 02:37:50,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not feeling super great but I don't know.

1752
02:37:52,074 --> 02:37:52,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll play.

1753
02:37:53,074 --> 02:37:53,434
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1754
02:37:53,514 --> 02:37:55,135
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the Vecna stuff's fun.

1755
02:37:57,064 --> 02:38:23,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get the hand of Vecna like right away for me it was just all sorts of nostalgic goodness but I'll be honest there is that part of me that's got a little bit of burnout and I'm really hoping that I can get Baldur's Gate 3 working again so I can make it my Friday game but in the end though I just want to tell everybody go play some pinball for fuck's sake seriously sounds good alright well we'll see you again in a little bit DarkSakura

1756
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll go to you then.

1757
02:38:27,781 --> 02:38:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Your final thought tonight.

1758
02:38:29,302 --> 02:38:33,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I've finished the entrance to my theme park, do I have to work on the theme park, I guess?

1759
02:38:34,826 --> 02:38:45,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to be exciting this week, although we're probably not going to get to do it this week, but the new 121 update for Minecraft comes out on Thursday.

1760
02:38:45,774 --> 02:38:52,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So, unfortunately, we have to wait until all the mods update to be able to update the server, but that is a thing that's going to be happening soon.

1761
02:38:53,567 --> 02:38:55,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, we get armadillos!

1762
02:38:55,967 --> 02:39:04,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Can your theme park have that, uh, something like that video I love of the roller coaster that's not quite finished, so it plays all the sad Adele music while the people are flying off the track?

1763
02:39:04,909 --> 02:39:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would, I would really... I could do that, but the people to be flying off the track would be me, or whoever's writing it, and so that, that's not exactly fun, um, just to have to clean, have all that stuff cleaned up, but, um... Don't have to clean up a body.

1764
02:39:21,881 --> 02:39:24,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't hurt you is the problem.

1765
02:39:24,484 --> 02:39:28,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you just land and you're like, oh, okay, well, you know.

1766
02:39:28,868 --> 02:39:30,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're digital people, Loki.

1767
02:39:30,990 --> 02:39:31,631
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not real.

1768
02:39:31,931 --> 02:39:32,332
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them.

1769
02:39:32,772 --> 02:39:37,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I don't care about those fake people, but yeah, we're going to do stuff.

1770
02:39:37,757 --> 02:39:39,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone was asking, is there going to be Tingle Land?

1771
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:40,440
Yeah.

1772
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:42,983
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's Yeti Park.

1773
02:39:43,143 --> 02:39:45,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So to give context, I'll be really quick with this.

1774
02:39:45,767 --> 02:39:51,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeti is a radio station that was in the first season of Channel 64.

1775
02:39:51,834 --> 02:39:55,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Second season, it became a TV studio, a TV station.

1776
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:58,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's like kind of evolving into like a

1777
02:39:58,903 --> 02:40:22,405
[SPEAKER_04]: a multimedia company like Disneyland you know sort of but we're not obviously I'm not modeling the park after Disneyland it's more of like like this first episode was based off of California's Great America and this thing called Europa Park in Germany it's a rust Germany I believe so I'm trying to like pull inspiration from a bunch of theme parks all around the world

1778
02:40:23,737 --> 02:40:24,017
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1779
02:40:25,537 --> 02:40:26,298
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought.

1780
02:40:27,298 --> 02:40:29,058
[SPEAKER_05]: More streams this week on my personal channel.

1781
02:40:29,078 --> 02:40:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're not following me yet at Rob Roberts, please consider it here on Twitch.

1782
02:40:32,839 --> 02:40:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably do some Diablo 4 this week, you know, because there's a big event going on right now for extra XP and then probably more Final Fantasy 14 because I'm down to two classes to get to level 90 before the expansion comes out.

1783
02:40:44,982 --> 02:40:45,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's Warrior.

1784
02:40:45,862 --> 02:40:50,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to get all 10 levels and then I have to get about three more levels on Dragoon because I finished off Monk.

1785
02:40:50,903 --> 02:40:52,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get the rest to 90.

1786
02:40:53,564 --> 02:40:55,925
[SPEAKER_05]: because Dawn Trail is out in less than three weeks.

1787
02:40:56,166 --> 02:40:56,946
[SPEAKER_05]: The clock is ticking.

1788
02:40:57,727 --> 02:40:59,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That also reminds me, we're going to be streaming on Saturday too.

1789
02:41:00,188 --> 02:41:00,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

1790
02:41:01,089 --> 02:41:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another stream day.

1791
02:41:02,530 --> 02:41:02,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

1792
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:03,570
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1793
02:41:04,131 --> 02:41:08,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, with that, we are going to wrap it up and we'll see you in seven days.

1794
02:41:08,093 --> 02:41:10,114
[SPEAKER_05]: So start the clock and we'll see you in seven days.

1795
02:41:10,554 --> 02:41:11,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night, everybody.

1796
02:41:11,675 --> 02:41:11,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
