9716	12899	A delayed game is eventually good, but a bad game is bad forever.
13079	16602	Accepted as fact, touted as pure truth, and said it in error when it was relevant.
16762	21866	The quote is slightly modified from its possible original form, but bad games have lately surmounted their forever bad status.
22246	26970	No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy XIV's original release, Cyberpunk 2077, and now the Grand Theft Auto trilogy.
27350	29112	This is the 640k of Memory Intro.
29232	34016	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this bug fix and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34356	36378	Starting right now on the show, wherever a gamer has a voice...
39164	41585	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41625	46407	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46507	61935	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again here on Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com or twitch.tv slash vognetwork with episode number 1025 of our show taping on November the 17th of 2024.
66897	68899	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
86434	91881	Yeah, but you know, I just realized that it's usually around this time of year that I lose my voice anyway.
93263	94584	And it's inexplicable.
94665	101814	I don't know why, but in this case, I had a sinus infection that was paired with a really bad cold.
102074	104117	And I'm still hacking up the stuff.
104845	112711	I was going to suggest tying it back to something that was discussed on Bobby's show this evening because we do tape live at VOG Network after Bobby Blackwolf every Sunday night at 9 Eastern.
114032	118375	Maybe you are allergic to people putting up their holiday lights before Thanksgiving.
119136	120337	I could have told you that.
122794	124215	So you are also in agreement.
124335	126836	Keep the lights in the box until after Thanksgiving.
127816	130597	Except for my neighbor that has the Christmas dragon.
130617	132497	They're allowed.
132557	133678	Dragons are accepted.
134498	135658	Dragons are accepted.
136119	144821	But, I mean, I still have my Halloween welcome mat that's a big spider web still on my front porch.
145542	146962	I haven't put away stuff yet.
147102	150085	A welcome mat is not the biggest crime in the world.
150325	162675	If you want to give off Addams Family vibes 24 hours a day, 365 a year, I don't think... There's a fine line between holiday decorations and just Addams Family vibes.
162815	165277	And I think it's fine to give off the Addams Family vibes.
165397	173864	After Halloween, I go to Spirit and Joanne's and all that and pick up decorations for the house year-round on discounts.
174024	174324	Actually...
176546	178288	I have two things in my bathroom.
178849	183253	I would say two-thirds of the people I know involved with the Rocky Horror Picture Show say the exact same thing.
184515	195486	One of the things that I'm really happy about is I have a toilet with a gravestone and then I have a skeleton leaning on a toilet checking her phone.
197299	200642	and so those will be permanent in my bathroom.
200962	201283	Love it.
201363	210971	And then I have my my skeletons doing yoga and I paint them just with an iridescent gloss so they kind of shimmer.
212333	213193	They're in my cube at work.
213273	215015	I haven't taken down any of my decorations at work.
215295	216496	Then again, I haven't been there.
217857	219439	And SSJ100 Matt, you know what?
220337	238826	I don't have to deal with an HOA so fuck them and fuck their rules so SJ100 Matt bringing up if you're part of an HOA you better get those decorations down before you get ridiculously fined yeah that's a thing that's been good because unfortunately as a newer you know house I do have one of those and it's the most annoying thing about living here but it is what it is so
240910	247535	I don't want to live somewhere where other people dictate to me what my home that I have paid for looks like.
247755	250357	I view this as a stepping stone to our forever home.
250557	255321	So let's see, looking in chat, some other questions.
255361	259264	Yeah, I love, Bobby was telling me about how his was set up and he says, my HOA is the best.
259384	263507	It's just a social HOA and has no architectural components.
264327	264647	Covenants?
264668	265028	Covenants.
265368	268771	So, sorry, my eyesight's going bad today.
268911	275918	So, they basically, like, they all pay for a pool, basically, but they don't do anything with, like, what your house has to look like, which is, I'm okay with that.
276278	278420	I'm okay with, like, a community pool, I guess.
278460	279361	We have a community pool here.
279401	281743	I don't use it because it's a pee-pee pool.
281883	285246	Like, I just know it's a toilet for kids, so I don't want to swim in it.
285586	286747	That's what chlorine is for.
288107	288507	Not enough.
288527	288768	I'm joking.
288788	289288	There's not enough.
289308	289508	Gross.
290348	290688	Let's see.
290809	292189	So some other comments from chat.
292449	295731	Phil of Nine in chat says, Joanne's was a slay this holiday season, though.
296311	297091	Or Halloween season.
297352	299012	Sorry, specifically Halloween holiday.
300193	301614	The only holiday I recognize.
302894	306136	Personally.
306236	310938	My voice, though, is extra rough today because I went to see Eddie Izzard.
311418	312759	Professionally, Eddie Izzard.
313059	314300	Personally, Susie Izzard.
316421	326938	for the retrospective comedy show and they filled the place with so much smoke machine smoke that my cough actually came back hardcore.
327639	330844	What does Eddie Izzard need a smoke machine for?
332012	335496	I don't know, maybe it was Davis' idea?
335556	337338	Okay, who knows, yeah.
338258	348409	But it was such a good show, and touching back on previous sketches, there was Cake or Death.
348971	376812	of course you don't do the greatest hits without cake or death there was another one that I loved but the flag did not happen that's okay but it was really good and if that tour is going anywhere that you are I don't want to spoil it for anybody just go see it it was really really good she was in full form amazing full of energy bouncing all over the stage also her legs looked really good I'm just going to say that right now
377592	406175	and thank you for clarifying the name because I actually didn't know like what so Eddie Izzard's like a drag name at this point basically so it's like professional on stage name okay um but uh but yeah totally absolutely worth it I had such a good time um and all the people that were sitting between me and my friend Danielle they moved so Danielle could sit by me and we uh had grown-up drinks and laughed and
406955	414379	The people sitting next to us on the other side were also really cool because they graduated the same year I did and we were all just talking about all this stuff.
414419	414879	It was great.
415419	415739	All right.
416540	416820	All right.
416880	424924	Well, I got to get over to... So we may be hearing from Jamie a little less tonight to let her voice relax so she won't be doing as many stories, but we will be checking with the Classic Game of the Week.
425364	428065	And of course, if she has an opinion, she's going to let you know.
428465	431627	So she just might have to put up her hand or something if we can't hear her.
432547	433428	But I'm sure it'll be fine.
433988	435529	Alright, let's see.
435549	444732	I also want to make sure we introduce Techmaster Loki because we got another comment in chat over at Twitch.com slash VOG Network that says, what the hell is this thing Loki has on?
445072	446692	So you have a game playing behind you tonight.
446732	449593	It definitely looks like some kind of meme thing that I'm not familiar with.
449633	451054	What is this meme game you got?
452054	460557	So it's just something I saw on the Steam store when I was looking at what came out recently and I had to...
461687	462447	I had to have it.
464188	472150	It's actually supposed to be a pretty decent shooter and it's got the name you would expect it to have.
472650	475251	So the full name, and I'm going to read it, is extremely long.
476051	480092	It is, because it's all the most awesome memes, right?
480772	490855	420 Blaze It 2 Game of the Year, Dank Dreams and Goated Memes, hashtag wow out of 11, like and subscribe, Poggers Edition is the full name of that game.
493089	494950	I would have thought you made it, to be quite honest.
496010	498991	If you told me that was a game on Steam, I would have been like, did Loki make that?
500031	500611	I wish.
500911	502632	All that's missing is Sephiroth.
502852	505153	I guess that's probably a trademark name, so I probably can't use it.
505553	506513	But that's, yeah.
507414	510935	Yeah, I mean, it's supposed to be pretty good.
511875	515196	I didn't think Sephiroth could be trademarked because it's actually a religious term.
516593	517174	Oh, interesting.
517395	518397	It is part of the Kabbalah.
519959	520821	Oh, maybe it can't then.
520881	521723	Okay, well, anyway.
522504	523847	Then that's what is missing.
526429	529230	FifthDream in chat says, I've gone so long without hearing Dank.
529390	530551	Streak is broken.
530871	535393	So is this old and moldy memes, Loki, or is this like really funny stuff?
535413	537073	It's supposed to be like 2014 memes, I think.
537173	545136	It's a sequel to a game that came out in 2014, and I don't really understand what the reference is to a lot of this stuff.
545276	548538	It's a bunch of visual vomit.
548598	554400	But it's apparently a competent shooter, and that it's executing its theme
555600	579513	well i guess i don't know it's got mostly positive reviews so so if it's 24 it's not going to have like the newer memes like skibbity toilet or you know i don't know no it's got like thomas the tank engine shrek okay dabbing stuff like that okay oh that definitely that sounds 2014 found any macho man i mean i don't know it it's got it's got a lot of
580202	582063	I don't know what's going on.
604756	606458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
623414	626436	But it's interestingly enough caused a lot of comments.
626676	632501	I feel like Xbox and Microsoft have been making a lot of announcements this week because we have a lot of stuff coming out of Blizzard this week too.
632521	633481	We'll get to later in the show.
633801	637404	But here at the top of the show, Loki, a lot of stuff coming out of Xbox.
637564	641507	Kind of randomly some different offhanded comments this week in the wake of the PS5 Pro, right?
642076	642876	So essentially, you know,
670970	693467	they're saying that the right now they're not really they think about hardware you know and how they can create unique value for players and as far as like you know does it make sense to put new hardware out obviously they are working on new hardware um but they said they don't want to do incremental hardware um right now um they have to essentially
694676	701279	Work on hardware that's going to make, I guess, Xbox the best it could be, instead of just like, well, this console has slightly more storage.
701359	710983	Although, that said, they just did that, so... I mean, it's not new hardware, but it's hardware that's a different skew, that has more storage.
711003	713564	The hardware is kind of experimental.
714164	718886	They're like, well, we don't want to do that, but then also, we are doing that.
719386	723668	I think what they're talking about is more of like performance, you know, with the PlayStation 5 Pro.
726296	731680	That would get very confusing with Xbox series games or whatever.
731700	736603	It's like, well, now you have three different tiers that you're targeting for, like...
738411	741053	as a developer to make things even more complicated.
741153	743235	So I don't know.
743275	744016	I understand that.
744416	763952	He says, you know, we're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles is another thing that basically that they want the price point of a new console to make sense for people buying those because it is, especially when you're talking about like, you know, PlayStation VR 2 and the PlayStation 5, you know, you add that all together, you are getting...
764392	765933	Pretty high prices.
766873	774136	Just to experience PlayStation VR 2 games, which, I mean, there's not a lot of those, and I don't know how well they're supporting it.
774156	775196	It may go the way of the Vita.
775236	775577	Who knows?
777867	792061	Although they are saying, you know, some other questions that were asked to Phil Spencer talking about, of course, you know, this multi-platform strategy that they have and saying that, you know, there's no red line with exclusives.
792382	798347	Essentially that, you know, even something like Halo could possibly make it to other platforms.
798367	799429	Yeah.
800492	828859	so that's interesting, he says I do not see sort of red lines with their portfolio that you must not do that it's too early to make any sort of decisions on the next version though of Halo probably because it's nowhere near done yet and we don't even know what the landscape is going to look like then and you know, hey, by then maybe we can target the next Nintendo console if it's powerful enough, who knows and then of course keeping the hope alive I guess
829723	852743	talking about how they're working on a portable device but it's not going to be available anytime soon so I'm curious to see what that would be if that's going to be like an actual like Steam Deck type console more of a PC where you're utilizing xCloud type stuff with that maybe some of the PC Game Pass library things be interesting to see what they do with that
854022	868637	Yeah, that would be my guess is it's more of a competitor for the Steam Deck type of thing and it kind of leverages Game Pass where it makes sense and the cloud to deliver maybe some of the high high performance games might be relying on the cloud a little bit so you'll probably have to have
869771	877277	really strong internet connection, whether that be at home or maybe something they're trying to wait for a little bit is better 5G type of availability.
877517	880880	Although I fear it's not going to happen in the next four years, but we'll see.
881300	882101	Well, you never know.
882121	887004	I mean, we don't know what the specs are going to look like in a few years, too, because if you think about that, they're looking to put a console out.
887044	896051	I mean, it'd be weird to target Xbox Series S type specs, but I assume they could probably do something pretty decent.
896111	898293	Let me look at what the Steam Deck looks like right now.
898313	899154	Sure.
900034	921910	I mean it's only going to be more powerful in four years so I could see them doing something like that but they did have to really make I think they couldn't just say oh it's a console to play games on the go I think it'd be better like to actually do something unique with it but who knows
923479	929423	Maybe something that enables, I don't know, like multiplayer in the same room type of thing when you have more than one device.
929483	936327	I mean, I know that's not exactly a novel concept, but it might be something to maybe lean into a little more with some of the software offerings, right?
936747	942630	Recognize that one thing that Nintendo does very well is the party in the room atmosphere type of games, right?
942650	944672	Like the Mario parties, the Mario karts of the world.
945032	945832	Nintendo has a lot on that.
945852	946653	Yeah, and please don't try to...
947353	952555	Don't try to, like, copy the Switch, you know, eight years too late or something like that, you know what I mean?
952635	960198	Don't pull, like, a PlayStation Move or a Microsoft Kinect nonsense, you know, just do something unique and new.
960318	966780	But I think they see that, you know, Steam Decks are gonna, that whole concept, and the Switch, you know, concept are here to stay, right?
966920	969081	So that whole concept of a portable...
969561	970942	Gaming Unit that does a lot.
971282	972583	It's going to be very interesting.
972603	980507	Of course, I say Gaming Unit, but if it's a Microsoft device, why the hell shouldn't it lean into things like Word and Excel and PowerPoint on the go as well?
982528	986471	Maybe that's another way they sell it, is that it's not just for games.
986911	990633	I don't know to what extent you could craft a PowerPoint on a device like that, but
991273	1014319	that would be horrible well to maybe dock it you know okay but to be fair like I did an entire PowerPoint that well not not PowerPoint it's um Apple's version of it I did it on an iPad uh numbers thank you without a keyboard so um you can do a lot with touch screens so you know maybe you know some some refinements may be a little more difficult but it's it's
1015717	1017982	Pretty rich at this point, so it'll be interesting.
1018663	1020868	But I know that's a ways away.
1025143	1028265	What about the thoughts of the Xbox games coming to other consoles?
1028866	1032008	I mean, I don't... They already kind of did it.
1032309	1034070	They've already been putting games on the Switch.
1034250	1039694	I actually don't think Halo on the Switch is a big deal at all.
1039774	1042576	Halo on the PlayStation would be very, very interesting.
1043077	1046960	But it's interesting because...
1048641	1074986	Bobby was talking on his show about the DLC for Atari 50 that came out this week which I haven't gotten around to yet because I was playing another game by Digital Eclipse this week which I'll talk about in a minute but the Atari 50 DLC that talks about the first console wars and how Intellivision is was making Atari versions of their games because the Intellivision and the Atari were such different hardware but it's like why would you limit yourself to just
1075686	1103824	the Intellivision segment of the market why wouldn't you tap into Atari's segment of the market and get as many sales as you can over there too when there's five times as many Atari's out there so it's interesting in light of like just hearing about that and in the shadow of this look back on this first game war how it's coming full circle where now Microsoft's going why wouldn't we just release it on Sony's platform well yeah it kind of harkens back to this whole like
1104855	1112680	I was going to say, are you talking about all these people coming out after the election deciding to show their entire ass and hole?
1112720	1113100	But anyway.
1136076	1143080	Real quick, I need to correct myself because when you said PowerPoint, my brain heard spreadsheet for some stupid reason.
1144381	1150445	I have been talking about Excel as well, like the whole office suite of things, but yet personally I used Keynote.
1150465	1152627	That's right, the name just slipped my mind in the moment, but yeah.
1154480	1155361	I hate to say it.
1155481	1157943	I know it's a little cringe, but I'm just going to be honest.
1158083	1163468	Some software gets to that point of Xerox or Kleenex where it's a PowerPoint.
1163788	1170314	I know, but that's... Actually, more commonly, I hear keynote presentation more than anything in other medias.
1173136	1173777	I don't want to get into it.
1174477	1176639	We're going to present a keynote on so-and-so and so-and-so.
1176659	1177920	Anyways, so...
1181996	1193264	I just think it ever... You mean, yeah, when we were kids and, you know, in school and, like, rooting for consoles, okay, that makes sense because we're dumb kids and we don't know any better, but, like...
1194922	1200207	As adults rooting for a console and stuff like that, it's just silly.
1200867	1201748	And I get it.
1201928	1204290	It makes sense for Microsoft to put their games in.
1205331	1209134	It's basically to get it played by as many people as possible.
1209214	1209434	Yes.
1209614	1211836	Now, what does that do to the console itself?
1212336	1219022	It makes it so the console isn't necessarily as important to buy than, say, a PlayStation console or something like that.
1219642	1243867	but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing it's nice to have choice for what you can play if Sony would you know be a little bit more cross-platform with their games as well I mean that would be pretty cool I just think it's something to consider when you're looking at a new console down the road that you know if you don't get a Microsoft console it may not be the end of the world because their products are everywhere and eventually they may just
1245046	1261396	forget doing a console and just whatever we're just gonna this is an Xbox laptop now and you're just gonna play Xbox games on it along with everything else that you do because Xbox is part of Windows now and that's how it goes um
1262844	1263344	Yeah, I don't know.
1263645	1265506	I just think the whole console war thing is stupid.
1265526	1275075	I had to explain that to my wife, you know, what the console wars were, because she was asking a question about something, like someone was comparing it to the console wars, and I had to explain to her what that was.
1275616	1276517	And it's silly.
1276857	1277337	You do...
1278338	1284584	You talked about, you know, when you are stupid kids, you can get into console wars because that's what people do.
1285705	1291309	I mean, with all due respect, you have children who are that perfect stupid kid age, although your children are very intelligent.
1291409	1295773	But, you know, they're at that age where if they were going to fight about something, consoles would be it.
1295833	1296834	Do they get into that at all?
1296854	1298015	They don't care.
1298075	1299496	They don't care.
1299876	1301017	They play games wherever they want.
1301037	1301478	They've got...
1302298	1302738	and many more.
1325003	1333014	and I'm sure there are audiences out there of people that use those services that are like, well, ha, Netflix got that and Hulu doesn't.
1333274	1334556	Nobody cares, dude.
1334736	1335497	Nobody cares.
1335718	1338481	It's a silly thing to...
1339022	1339322	There you go.
1339342	1339482	Alright.
1361547	1369935	Well on that note, let's move into the types of games that we were rooting for this week in our gaming week and talk a little bit about how was your gaming week.
1369995	1373799	So I will go to DarkSakura if you'd like to share anything that you were playing in your gaming week.
1374733	1400307	I restarted Dragon Age Veilguard so I could sort of do a continuation of my very first Inquisition game and so far you know how like you have those games you've got dating options you'd be like wow I'm gonna date so-and-so they look cool I have not felt that way yet about anybody except I just got Davran and he's kind of cool so maybe maybe it'll be him
1401467	1427648	um there's things that I like but the writing is a bit just the writing is not as good as what I would expect the games to have um but I'm a side quest person I love to look at the scenery I love lore I love all of that type of stuff and so I'm kind of giving it the Xanadu treatment I love all of the parts of it the whole thing may not be great but
1428408	1451504	but I'm totally enjoying all of the parts of it you know in my digestible chunks I have to say with Dragon Age Veilguard since you brought it up with the companions now granted I'm still early on so there's a lot of probably nuance and things I haven't you did get it yeah I did get it and I played like maybe three hours of it oh yeah you weren't here last week so I couldn't tell you about it so I did play a little bit about it a little bit of it just a little bit um but I can say I'm completely
1452744	1467737	I have hearts in my eyes for one of the characters and it's it's a weird thing because I'm not used to like wanting I'm just gonna keep it real I'm not used to wanting to have a heterosexual relationship in these games but like I love her go ahead and say is it Neve?
1467757	1479687	you already know you already know it's Neve Neve is awesome but she wasn't the kind that I go for she's like the Miranda to me okay no I love her I love her in her hat
1481162	1510302	her little fascinator yes I did though get some armor for her that I like a lot better than her default outfit okay I'll see I need to I need to make myself play more hashtag do it for now I'll do some screenshots but I was gonna go after Harding at first but she's just like been a friend always there you know so and I still I something got a little spoiled for me so I'm gonna let that happen because I think it's cute um but uh
1511703	1533542	I don't know, usually I'm like not into the Grey Warden character or anything but Daverin's kind of cool and he comes with a griffin so what's not to love but which actually I love it too because there's so much of the apocrypha that goes into it like the comics and early stories and old legends and things and I like that they're bringing that in I just wish they were doing it
1534302	1562750	a lot more well everything you know of from the other games is wrong let's not ever mention the hero of Ferelden oh look though Dorian has aged nicely anyway I love him I'm glad that they included I'm just going to go ahead and say it they put Mevaris from the comics in there and I freaking love Mevaris from Those Who Sleep and all those if you want to read those comics I will lend them to you she is a delight um
1564700	1588264	and if I am correct she is the second transgender character in the Dragon Age franchise after Crem so I will say however there's something that really irked me with it and I'm glad to have good well I'm happy to have transgender representation but there's a few things that seem
1589813	1604966	I don't want to say anachronistic, you know, but things that don't make sense within the established medicine and technologies within the series, right?
1605286	1610110	It is cool, though, for personal representation, you can have your surgery scars, you know, for top surgery.
1611071	1613773	But they go really heavy handed.
1614533	1623478	And I was listening to some reviews by some trans streamers who were saying that, yeah, these are never the words that I would have used for myself.
1623878	1627520	These were words that were made up by a non-trans person.
1628261	1633884	I seem to remember that same criticism in Andromeda, and they ended up going back and fixing it as part of it.
1634605	1658824	that was with the dead naming yeah yeah it was a little more severe in that case but yeah I just I like I'm just I'm feeling like echoes back to that you know but they had but Maevaris I think dead named herself once or someone did interesting and so if if you respect somebody who who has transitioned don't bring up their dead name
1659284	1677634	you know maybe they want to for some reason like hey you knew me before you know meeting like an old classmate or something oh yeah you knew me as this this is me now you know I can understand that but not just telling oh random stranger who has no idea who I ever was you know in a past life or anything I don't think that's cool
1679075	1707792	and it's up to the person anyway so there are so far it's really heavy handed I think and not in a good way and I'm kind of afraid about what's going to happen when we get when I get Tosh because that's a little bit more that was spoiled for me but I'm not going to go into full detail on that one I'll let whoever plays it know but
1709052	1721036	I... That was a cringe moment for me because I actually had to go back and replay those scenes so that I would just stick with how my character is, right?
1721937	1722197	So...
1724071	1727192	I like, though, a good portion of the dialogue.
1727232	1732694	Like, right now, I've had Balaras and Harding in my party.
1733994	1738716	And they actually get along so well and tease each other.
1738876	1748059	And then they go over, since Balaras is like a tinkerer of ancient technology, and Harding goes through her thing.
1749059	1750140	Again, not spoiling.
1751060	1754882	They actually have a discussion about where their cultures intermix.
1756202	1765827	Like words that were borrowed from one language versus another and different pieces of their own cultural lore that actually have common roots.
1766067	1768008	And that, to me, I love stuff like that.
1769189	1772390	I love ancient sociology.
1772690	1774551	I love, you know, I guess...
1778180	1804263	like constructed sociology too you know stuff like that it just makes me really really happy and it immerses me in the universe those are the things that i enjoy um so um of course um i did play a little dead by daylight i tried to stream on tuesday but i had even less voice than i do now this is what i sound like by the way when i lead my uh my team meetings
1805876	1832757	so I usually like okay somebody else talk for a minute so I played for about four games I made it through and Shay and Ryan joined me and Smokey at the end for some but by the time I got there I was like I'm so glad they talk all this much but I couldn't make myself heard to say hey killer's over here or this is who the killer is you know because by that point I was sounding like this
1834042	1839985	So this is honestly more voices than I've had in a while, but as you can tell, it wears out.
1840145	1846107	I'm drinking very hot coffee mixed with Junior Mint hot chocolate.
1847128	1847548	Delightful.
1848488	1850129	So it's really warm on my throat.
1850249	1851970	But back to the Dead by Daylight.
1853010	1858352	I'm going to play some more tonight because I want to get through the tome for 2v8.
1860695	1878858	um I didn't get well I got through everything for the haunted whatever but I forgot to go back and get the other two killer weapons so my bad um but I'm gonna try to get everything done even if I have to play offline um and
1879398	1884360	If I may mention, I am going to be playing a lot of Dead by Daylight on the 29th.
1885580	1888681	So you don't have to stand in line for that TV.
1889421	1890562	You can hang out with me instead.
1891222	1892843	Doesn't everybody shop online these days now?
1895624	1896444	The smart people do.
1897564	1898364	All right.
1898945	1903766	But at any rate, and yeah, I was also still playing Suika and
1907512	1910334	I know I played something else, but my brain is broken.
1911014	1913375	I think I played sleeping a lot.
1913495	1914596	The sleeping game was great.
1916277	1917858	And, uh, yeah.
1918738	1919018	Alright.
1920319	1921099	Well, let's move on.
1921139	1921900	We'll talk about Loki.
1921920	1922640	How was your gaming week?
1923941	1925302	It was just all Minecraft stuff.
1925342	1932305	I've been working on Channel 64 content, so I had to make a ton of custom models this week.
1932385	1933026	I had like 110 of them.
1933046	1933166	And, uh,
1936568	1952869	just working on new park stuff I've got a new fishing minigame that is going to be in the next episode and then this whole redemption thing that essentially you earn tickets by going to the attractions and then you can redeem those tickets for
1953590	1982101	random plushies and then of course like any midway you can trade three small plushies for a larger plushie and so I have to build the systems and do all that so I've been like toiling away with custom redstone so I finally got the filter system to make it idiot proof so that you can't break it that was tricky but this starts my two weeks of working on Minecraft content all
1983121	2007935	I've taken the rest of the month off so I'm gonna try to get the big water ride done excited for you jealous of your big break I uh I should have thought ahead and took a little break too uh just so I can work on some creative projects and just you know um rest you know yeah yeah no I'm excited for your uh creative projects and getting that done it's great yeah it'll be fun all right
2008983	2030998	my gaming week so um been playing more Diablo 4 I finished the battle pass so not just not just the season journey but the battle pass so there's nothing more I can do in season six unless I just want to grind my character to higher levels which I think I am I am a-okay putting it on the back burner for a little bit outside of I may create a few more videos for my YouTube channel because those videos are actually performing better than my classic lookbacks so hey
2031998	2037140	I will get those cheap likes and subscribes wherever I can get them, as long as it's in my wheelhouse.
2037180	2041142	I'm not going to invalidate my morals to do it, but I do love Diablo 4.
2041182	2046424	I just don't, you know, I don't see myself playing this particular season a heck of a lot more now that I've kind of hit that point.
2046464	2048545	So I kind of get to put that on the back burner until January.
2049025	2053427	Final Fantasy XIV, on the other hand, got a patch this week with some new content.
2053447	2054487	So I've been enjoying that.
2055047	2057468	There's a Final Fantasy XI inspired raid.
2057488	2058809	I don't know if you heard about this.
2059229	2059729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2075861	2076881	I look forward to playing that.
2076941	2079143	I have done the new dungeon, which is a very different thing.
2079183	2082124	It's more in line with the Dawn Trail story and everything.
2083425	2085466	The new dungeon actually had some really good mechanics.
2085526	2089749	The last boss mechanics, I'm actually really like, oh, this is awesome that...
2090969	2095592	I mean, there were some things where I was like, oh, they just did the same thing that they did in the Ruby Weapon Raid.
2095992	2108620	But there's other parts of it where I'm like, oh, they really, really want to make arenas different shapes and do different things with them than your standard, like, MMO, go in the room, and it's a circle, and the boss is just standing at you.
2108941	2112363	They did something very different, and I thought I liked it.
2113283	2114364	So yeah, good times.
2114784	2115024	Yeah.
2115985	2127629	Other games I've been playing this week, I got to check out, I mentioned earlier in the show, I was gaming at a friend's last night who has a lot of gaming system, invests in a lot of stuff, and had a PlayStation 5 Pro.
2128170	2132851	And so he was actually showing off, I say showing off, but just kind of so we could get a taste of it.
2133091	2134332	Because not every game...
2135092	2143981	is kind of tuned up for the PlayStation 5 Pro, although he was saying that some games that ran sluggish on PlayStation 5, he mentioned Forspoken specifically.
2144001	2146623	I don't know if you remember that one from Square Enix kind of early on.
2147044	2151268	It didn't get a lot of traction because I think some people said it was buggy and stuff.
2151308	2155152	Apparently it plays much better on PlayStation 5 Pro, even though they didn't
2155632	2156652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2178539	2194481	it's like you're getting your 4k performance mode but in 60 frames that's you know and technically there was an even higher performance mode that was still 30 frames but he said no 60 frames only and I tend to agree I'm always like 60 frames only no no if the game can do 60 frames do it
2195702	2200446	So he showed that and a little bit of Final Fantasy Rebirth so we could kind of see what it looks like.
2200486	2212796	And yeah, especially, especially, I was just really stricken with the color, the way Aloy's face looked and her companion early on in the game, the gentleman's name, I don't remember, sorry.
2213156	2216679	But the way they looked, like their faces were just...
2217219	2218260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2235771	2237692	to get this same type of graphic performance.
2238073	2244797	And so if that type of stuff is important to you and you want the latest and greatest, it's going to make it pretty, I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money.
2245197	2252562	I don't think the upgrades are worth it to me, but once I saw it, I was like, okay, yeah, that does look really good.
2253783	2257245	But I also know I game usually on my computer monitor here in my office.
2257686	2264170	He had a big, big TV, and I feel like a lot of those things sort of make way for the changes as well.
2266552	2270914	Yeah, and Ranma says there's better ROI on PC parts than a pro console.
2271334	2271675	True.
2271955	2274596	You know, people just have to make the choice that makes them happy.
2274977	2276798	You know, what makes sense for their household.
2277358	2281801	And if you are a big console gamer, which some people are, this is of interest to you.
2282221	2283001	I will say this.
2283782	2287244	This friend of mine is really big in VR.
2287324	2288885	He really loves VR stuff too.
2289465	2293168	And so the other game we checked out a little bit was No Man's Sky.
2293928	2295309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2318464	2346632	but they played it in VR I never got around to playing it in the PSVR too because I got pulled into a game of Big Brain Academy on the Switch so I didn't get to get around to see VR but they were just raving about it they were like this looks so fucking good oh my god like they were just like super like yeah they were really into it so I'm like okay well I guess maybe that I do maybe next time I go over there I need to be like hey I didn't get to see No Man's Sky last time I want to see that so um
2347412	2350333	Yeah, Bobby said, I still hate the VR controls, No Man's Sky.
2350713	2351733	I noticed they were doing all this.
2351753	2355714	He's like, yeah, you got to reach behind your back to get the multi-tool and you got to do all this.
2355794	2357554	And so like, they were like, how do you do this?
2357574	2357975	How do you do this?
2357995	2360875	I'm sitting there going, I literally don't know.
2361435	2364896	I don't know how to do this in VR because they changed all the fucking controls.
2364976	2365976	So I don't know what to tell you.
2366056	2366217	So...
2368397	2373664	Anyway, because I was doing it when they were playing on 2D and flat screen before they hooked up the VR.
2373684	2380633	I was like, oh yeah, hit this button, hit this button, go to this menu, you know, because I've played a lot of that game, but couldn't tell you a lick of it in VR.
2381214	2381454	All right.
2383086	2385947	I want to get to another game I played this week because this was a pretty big deal.
2386487	2398852	So I also played the game Tetris Forever, which is the latest entry in the Gold Master series, which is essentially trying to be the Criterion Collection of Blu-rays, but this is, you know, for video games.
2399172	2405555	It's the Gold Master series done by Digital Eclipse, which Atari 50 was sort of zero in that series.
2405575	2408756	It wasn't officially Gold Master, but let's be real, Atari 50 kind of led to that.
2409076	2410577	And then they had Karateka
2411457	2413298	The Making of Karateka, I think, was the first one.
2413578	2416279	They had the Jeff Minter story, which was the second one.
2416559	2418540	And now we have Tetris Forever, which is the third one.
2419001	2419481	And you know what?
2419561	2422842	I just have to say out the gate, I'm really happy this series exists.
2423483	2437549	As a fan of classic gaming, I just really love how this is put together as a documentary, as something that you can move through and really take a good look at prototypes and even manuals that were in Japanese.
2437609	2439270	I was going to the extent where I was like, okay...
2439810	2443653	Here's the back of the box in Japanese the way they were selling this game in Japan.
2443973	2447736	I want to bring up my Google Translate lens and see what did this actually say?
2447756	2448837	How were they saying it?
2448857	2451739	Some of the cartoons were really funny and some of the things they were saying.
2452259	2456042	I was like, this is just so neat to be able to explore this.
2456102	2463227	It's like finding your old magazine collection but going a step deeper with all the interactive components.
2463408	2467851	I'm really happy this series exists and I want to see it be successful and that's why I'm willing to
2468251	2468852	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2491494	2492496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2510638	2529837	it's not like somebody can build an electronica 60 emulator they had to go back and basically simulate it's more of a simulation but it's really well done uh it makes you feel like you're playing the old terminal you know it feels like an old terminal game and gives you a sense of playing the original original tetris uh in that um
2530678	2533300	I want to also say, I never saw the Tetris movie.
2533880	2540205	I never saw the movie that they did for the Apple films and the movie that they put out.
2540265	2544828	I was just kind of like, oh, Tetris is like a story about business?
2545008	2549932	It sounds like it's probably all blown out of proportion for Hollywood, whatever.
2550032	2551753	And that probably still is the case.
2552313	2552874	However...
2554924	2556345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2573843	2589132	and I just really enjoyed that trip and that information and getting to hear the story about how Hank went to Russia and he had no plan on how he was going to do it.
2589432	2590873	He didn't even know where he was going to go.
2590913	2601780	To hear him tell it himself and then like, you know, Alexei, the creator of Tetris was there in that too and they talk about meeting in the room for the first time and all this stuff.
2601800	2602180	Like it was...
2602660	2604161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2627694	2628675	and DarkSakura.com.
2647913	2648614	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2663584	2664665	Just, yeah, really neat.
2665045	2667688	And in the last chapter, they talk about Tetris Effect.
2667928	2669309	Tetsuya Mizuguchi is in the game.
2670390	2672973	He's not a huge part of it, but, you know, he talks about it.
2673533	2684483	And then they talk about, at the end, the very last sort of blip on the timeline is the kid who crashed Tetris last year.
2685103	2687405	Like, at the end of the year, like, he crashed Tetris.
2687426	2688526	He's like 13 years old.
2688567	2688667	Yeah.
2689147	2691608	Yeah, the kill screen on Tetris, basically.
2691748	2700631	It ends with that as sort of a way of saying this game is still relevant, is still a piece of history today.
2701351	2715035	That being said, some of the things where I was a little bit like, oh, this isn't... And Bobby says the movie plays up more life and death stuff that didn't exist, but the guts of the story is accurate.
2715495	2720558	Yeah, because he sort of brushes, he says, I wasn't really supposed to be there.
2720578	2723840	And if somebody had caught that I was there, I probably would have lost my visa.
2724100	2725021	He talks about those types of things.
2725401	2734446	I can see how in a movie, they probably really played up that whole, oh, he was in danger, you know, the type of thing that probably, at least hearing it from his mouth, didn't seem to be as big of a deal.
2734946	2744572	But anyway, they talk a lot because that whole story, that entire thing is all around that Game Boy release of the game.
2745768	2761845	and the quote I loved the most out of the entire thing and it's even on the splash screen when you boot the game and just really kind of showed the power and like why he was so dead set on getting the rights to the portable version of Tetris basically to put out the version on the Game Boy.
2763707	2767129	He went to Nintendo and he told Nintendo, and I'm paraphrasing here.
2767649	2769030	Sorry, I don't have the actual quote in front of me.
2769430	2773472	But, you know, originally the Game Boy was going to have Super Mario Land as the pack-in game.
2773833	2776254	That was what they were planning to do, which makes sense, right?
2776294	2777335	Mario game is pack-in game.
2777655	2778475	Worked for them before.
2778956	2785519	But he went to them and he said, if you want boys to play the Game Boy, pack in Mario.
2786600	2790002	If you want everybody to play the Game Boy, pack in Tetris.
2791547	2794411	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2810530	2817812	and they really show that personal touch to how it's really impacted the culture there.
2818393	2820253	Bobby says that moment is in the movie too.
2820313	2827335	I guess I can't be surprised about that because it is a really powerful quote that I think shows why they were so dead set on getting the portable rights.
2827656	2837819	And then it really breaks down the whole because they got the portable rights then that led to the discussion about well they should be able to get the console rights but yes this other organization and I sort of knew about this stuff where
2838439	2867162	another organization had the computer rights and they were taking computer to mean console as well and then there was a whole to-do in court about that and it does get into some of that and so it talks about Tengen Tetris it doesn't shy away from the fact that Atari and you even have people talking and they talk pretty respectfully about the Atari situation and they say we don't think that the guy and I forget his name in this that sold them the rights we don't think
2867822	2869403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2889015	2890816	The whole thing was very fascinating to me.
2891276	2893597	Not knowing a lot about how that all went down.
2893877	2898978	I knew about, yeah, it all hinged on they had the computer rights and the interpretation of what is a computer.
2899318	2900599	I know that's what it came down to.
2900899	2904080	But what I didn't know, I will fully admit, I did not realize this.
2904700	2909641	I did not realize Japan never got the NES version of Tetris we had.
2910362	2914623	That was specifically for non-Japan territories, including the US and Europe.
2915469	2916990	and DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2934716	2947865	But what's not there is the NES version of Tetris, the Game Boy version of Tetris, the Tengen version of Tetris, and all of these other versions of the game that they spend a lot of time talking about in the documentary.
2948025	2959032	Now look, I understand, like, it's a rights issue, Nintendo's doing their own thing, because Nintendo was the one to announce this whole thing originally in their direct, and they said, by the way...
2959372	2959872	Tengen Tengen
2979620	3007694	Atari owns Digital Eclipse why but clearly at some point those rights probably reverted elsewhere and that probably has to do with the way Midway worked and where a lot of those so I'm not it is what it is it's tied up legally and so those versions of the game just can't be in there but it is it is a loss that I kind of feel because I'm just going to be honest the original version of Tetris is cool getting to play the PC Tetris is cool but
3008598	3012523	There's stuff like Hatress, Bastress, Weltress.
3013064	3013925	And they talk about it.
3014165	3022076	They devote a little section as to where these sequels came from and why and how they were trying to expand on the puzzle phenomenon and the marketing and everything.
3022517	3023157	They just...
3024909	3026690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3046499	3049203	because an orange right says Tengen Tetris got airbrushed out.
3049483	3049884	Well, they do.
3050785	3051586	They talk about it.
3051766	3052127	They don't.
3052287	3053669	It's not a secret in this game.
3053689	3054610	They don't talk around it.
3055211	3056172	They say it's here.
3056252	3056913	This is what happened.
3056933	3058696	This is why there was, you know, and they get into it.
3059276	3059917	You just can't play it.
3062303	3074449	So, you know, recognizing that you're not going to get every version of Tetris, but you are going to get some of the key things throughout Tetris' history, as well as some other sideshow stuff, you know, like Tetris 2, Bomb Bliss.
3074709	3075869	I think Bomb Bliss is terrible.
3075889	3076690	Isn't there Toaster Tetris?
3077170	3077910	No, Toaster Tetris.
3078010	3078911	Bomb Bliss is in there.
3078931	3081352	I think Bomb Bliss is terrible, to be quite honest.
3081372	3085654	Sorry, I just, I think Bomb Bliss just kind of reeks as of how do we make Lightning Strike twice.
3085674	3086274	Tetranet?
3087615	3089017	No, Tetranet isn't in there.
3089177	3092261	But Tetris Time Warp is okay.
3093062	3093583	It's fine.
3094043	3096286	I appreciate the digital clips try to do something new.
3096406	3097728	And it's super cute.
3098049	3098369	I'll say it.
3098429	3098870	It's cute.
3099370	3103636	But to me, right now, the definitive version of Tetris is Tetris Effect.
3104585	3113708	which the game doesn't also... It also does not show... Tetsuya Mizuguchi is in the game talking about it, you know, but like... I'm still gonna go for the Grandmaster.
3113988	3114989	Yeah.
3115309	3120211	Tetris Grandmaster is not in there because it's an arcade series, but Tetris...
3122091	3125453	One of the big ports is in there.
3126353	3130756	See, it's hard for me at some point to remember what all is and isn't in there because they do talk about it.
3130776	3142942	So again, sorry, I've gone on way too long on this one game, but I do just want to say from a museum walkthrough perspective and how they have crafted this documentary, I think they did a fantastic job.
3143402	3146163	I think they really just laid out what it is.
3146623	3147264	From a...
3147904	3171244	get your hands and play all of these games that are on display in this gallery it's mostly there but there's definitely some holes in there that need to be filled in but to the Tetris company's benefit they probably would love if you playing this game made you go get a copy of Tetris Effect which is on sale right now because they're going to get two sales out of that and that's
3172372	3172972	It is what it is.
3173393	3175894	But yeah, kudos to the Gold Master Series.
3175914	3178596	I really can't wait to see what's next out of that.
3180117	3182159	It's the museum stuff and the educational.
3182619	3183299	I learned a lot.
3183400	3186081	I mean, I'm not sitting here going, oh, I knew everything about Tetris.
3186382	3187062	I certainly didn't.
3187162	3193086	But just kind of getting walked through and everything, I was like, okay, a lot of this makes so much sense.
3193566	3194627	Makes so much sense now.
3194647	3195408	Yeah.
3196627	3223217	one more thing I will close on because I thought that this was like one of the oh yeah I'm with Justin Mango in chat who says Tetris DS I love that version so much again they acknowledge it in the timeline but you can't play it in the archive but that would just be too many versions of Tetris there is one version of Tetris I noticed wasn't there it's the Jaleco version of Tetris that was on the original PlayStation which was fucking terrible they don't acknowledge it at all
3224224	3226387	It's hard to make a game so simple.
3226747	3227228	Terrible.
3227408	3232054	It was bad because they added the whole thing about the archaeologist that was walking along the top.
3233716	3235418	Because they added shit that didn't need to be there.
3235779	3236560	That's why it was terrible.
3237745	3239486	Anyway, but Tetris DS was great.
3239646	3239846	Yes.
3240366	3241607	And that's not in there, of course.
3242007	3253012	But anyway, I will say again, one of the documentary footage I found the most interesting was they have some rare footage, you know, because they Hank apparently loved to shoot movies because he had a lot of stuff on film.
3253332	3256974	And not only his stuff in Russia is really fascinating, the stuff that he did shoot there.
3257594	3285112	but he actually shows when Alexei came to the US and actually demoed his game for the people that were gonna make I think the Nintendo version of the game they actually show him like walking through the game and like talking about some of the design elements of his game and why the score was the way it was a certain way and all that stuff and I just thought those are the types of nuggets that we need to preserve
3285970	3291072	because that's where a lot of great games were born in the room talking to those people.
3291132	3298736	And I'm so glad they got these extensive interview footage with Alexei and Hank and all these people that were instrumental to it.
3299316	3300837	Just great to have that.
3301137	3302957	So yeah, I would encourage you to pick it up.
3302997	3307099	If you're a fan of Tetris and it's hard to go wrong with that game, pick it up, add it to your collection.
3307499	3313042	It's a worthy... I see this as the criterion collection of games.
3314397	3322159	You're going to want to own these because it really is the complete package that really helps you understand not just the game itself, but how the game was created.
3324220	3327861	TigerClaw says, is the stuff about the Game Boy prototype and the story true?
3328001	3329942	I don't know what that's referring to, unfortunately.
3329962	3331682	I don't know if that's a subplot in the movie or something.
3332783	3336124	They talk about how he fixed...
3337851	3345075	Nintendo apologized to Alexei, the creator of Tetris, for a bug that existed in the Game Boy version of the game.
3346075	3347416	That part was in the documentary.
3347436	3348696	I don't know if that's what it's referring to.
3350857	3356320	Yeah, SJ100Matt says, I wish Nintendo would let someone like Digital Eclipse do something like this with Miyamoto.
3357586	3358847	Oh my god, Matt.
3358867	3359727	That'd be amazing.
3359948	3361108	Oh my god.
3361148	3364110	Talk about a wish list thing.
3364851	3367032	I'm trying to think what Nintendo game
3368945	3391708	I mean like something like Balloon Fight I think would be great but it sucks because Iwata is no longer here right and so it's like we need we need to be making the literally we need to be making these things yesterday and if Nintendo doesn't want to partner with Digital Eclipse because they're Atari now then fine I wish Nintendo would look to this for a model about how to possibly preserve some of their own games so
3393151	3399053	Alright, anyway, I've talked way too much about that product, but you know I love me a classic game, and yeah, I had to talk about that.
3399153	3401074	So, let's get back into some gaming news.
3401414	3404135	Let's go over to Loki and talk about what is going on in the gaming world.
3404675	3411218	I will just quickly mention, I will not be here on December 15th.
3411898	3414199	So there will be no show that weekend, December 15th.
3414939	3416500	So, just fair warning.
3417820	3421442	Alright, let's move on to some more stories.
3422102	3422322	Loki.
3423140	3424740	Well, everything old is new again.
3424900	3426701	So, hey, remember the crew?
3426901	3428201	We're talking about it again.
3428661	3445946	You know, the whole back and forth with, you know, the movement to try to get laws put on the books to prevent, you know, online games from being taken offline and essentially giving you... revoking your access to a piece of product that you...
3446946	3449027	purchased, you know, in quotes.
3450168	3457491	Now, a few people from California filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft regarding the crew being taken offline.
3458312	3470918	And they filed in federal court claiming that Ubisoft has duped its consumers by telling them they are buying the game when in reality they're renting a limited license.
3474500	3474800	I mean...
3476053	3504416	yes but it's also EULA so I'm curious to see how that works out and then of course they gave a comparison explaining what it's like with the servers being taken down like imagine you buy a pinball machine and then a year later the company that sold that to you removed the bumpers and the flippers and the monitor displayed your score and all that stuff so it's like you still have it but not usable um
3506751	3531506	Also, along with that, we're reminded that also, I think we talked about this last week, how there is a law that went through in California talking about where basically these companies are going to have to explain if you click buy or purchase, if you're purchasing a game or purchasing a license for said thing, it's going to be more clear.
3532406	3553648	with that, but I don't know if they're, I don't think anything's gonna come of this lawsuit, honestly, because with the EULAs and all that, they try to kind of legally weasel their way out of there, but I do agree that, you know, the idea of purchasing the game meaning you can play stuff is very contentious when it comes to online, these
3554449	3566450	always online services that also aren't always online because eventually they shut them down when they're not profitable anymore so that kind of sucks for these live service games but I don't know, vote with your wallet
3567862	3568582	That's all we can do.
3568943	3574445	Yeah, I more see this story this week as a, we knew this was coming.
3574525	3582529	The minute they pulled this down and we saw that consumer advocacy groups were starting to kind of coalesce around this.
3582829	3585430	Literally, the question was asked, when's the lawsuit coming?
3585850	3591633	I mean, this isn't a clip from OLR I'm going to go back and play because everybody asked this question.
3591773	3593094	When's the lawsuit coming?
3594234	3595135	Today, here it is.
3595255	3596075	It came out this week.
3596435	3603278	But yeah, again, not to belittle the story because I think this is going to lead to bigger things.
3603338	3607560	I think there are a lot of people who are kind of like, I want to see this play out in court.
3607920	3609480	Popcorn.gif.
3609581	3610301	Let's see what happens.
3610321	3615183	I just don't think it will though because – I mean it may, but I don't think that –
3615763	3619785	Anything's going to come of it because they're going to be like, it was disclaimed.
3620406	3622427	But I guess, no, that kind of makes sense, though.
3622467	3624328	Like, if you think about it, it makes sense.
3625148	3636154	I don't know what verbiage is on the box, but like, assuming that you're a consumer purchasing the game physically, let's say that, physically, and...
3638499	3643765	I mean, when you're purchasing it out of store, you're not going to be aware of what's in that EULA.
3643785	3649251	So how can you agree to that EULA prior to seeing it when you purchase a game?
3649571	3651053	That's where I kind of think EULA's kind of broken down.
3651073	3653315	Loki, you better go join the legal team because you make a pretty good argument.
3653335	3653596	Yeah.
3654276	3658438	If you think about it, because it kind of breaks down, unless it's actually written on the box.
3658478	3661659	But once again, it's all the fine print on a box.
3663199	3664460	You're not signing that.
3664900	3666200	I don't know.
3666481	3675224	For what it's worth, Loki, I do tend to side with you that it is going to get shot down because this lawsuit is being filed in the U.S.,
3676335	3676936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3695814	3709264	Probably Britain, you know, and I would bet that they're very oftentimes stronger advocacy laws, especially like France, you know, and I would be very curious to see how this would play out in a court over there.
3709564	3716469	Well, I mean, they kind of tried that with the change in laws or trying to do that where they said that they're not technically...
3718663	3746430	it's fine that they do that I think when they were pursuing all that stuff so maybe I don't know if it's in California well I think it is in California so maybe I mean I don't know it's certainly not going to apply to that law that is on the books now or going to be on the books here very soon because this game came out in I think 2014 it's been a while so and I mean and to be fair like
3746789	3749872	The newer crew games now are going to have an offline patch.
3750032	3752013	Allegedly, they're going to have an offline patch.
3752214	3752814	I don't know.
3752874	3754536	That's supposedly in the works.
3754636	3755296	We'll see it.
3755336	3756597	That was damage control.
3757878	3758179	Yeah.
3758519	3758759	Yeah.
3760641	3760901	All right.
3761584	3774412	Well, on a somewhat related note, let's talk about, you know, the preservation of games and how people are starting to kind of, I guess, make an opportunity out of this whole thing with preserving games.
3774972	3781136	And this has to do with GOG, which of course is, I still, I didn't know it never meant good old games.
3781236	3785198	I didn't know at some point they were just GOG, but GOG started as good old games.
3785458	3789481	And the only time I've ever bought games from them was because I wanted old shit.
3790101	3792242	I wanted like, what did I buy on there?
3792542	3794623	Sid Meier's Covert Action is on there.
3795123	3796884	And there's not a lot of Sid Meier games on there.
3796904	3806747	I think Colonization from the early one, not the Civ IV version, but the early, early Colonization is also on the store and I need to get that at some point.
3807027	3810769	But whenever I've bought games on that storefront, it's because it is a old game.
3811109	3813389	I actually do want to be able to play on a modern machine.
3813750	3817111	And that's something that was sort of that store's niche for a long time.
3817771	3832443	and now they're going back and they have made a big old push this week called the GOG Preservation Program and they're calling it a determination to return to the roots of the company with a long-term commitment to preserve and maintain classic games for the foreseeable future.
3833244	3842312	On this list there are 100 games and the company is pledging to use its own resources to maintain the game's compatibility with modern systems and future systems.
3844593	3848214	And so, you know, we could talk about some of the games that are on this list and so forth.
3848834	3849754	I'm going to say this.
3850535	3857297	I think it's nice that we have this sort of thing out there in this effort to preserve the old games.
3858338	3864380	That being said, I can't help but feel this is a little opportunistic of GOG for the moment.
3865236	3888390	which I understand this is you got to make that money yay capitalism I say unenthusiastically this is how the world works you got to find that marketing thing where you can and you know I think GOG here is seeing an opportunity where gamers are up an arm about the lack of preservation and they have an opportunity to say hey we do preservation
3889350	3892894	And we've already been doing it for quite some time.
3892954	3894575	That's what our company was founded on.
3894895	3903343	But we're going to put a nice shiny coat of paint and write up a new mission statement and goal and vision for this.
3903504	3906827	And we're going to put it out there as our plan and our commitment to saving games.
3907751	3920630	so this whole thing I don't see what the news is in this to be quite honest beyond GOG launches new marketing campaign to let you know they exist
3921607	3922728	And it's working, P.S.
3922848	3924788	Because a lot of people are writing with this story this week.
3925069	3926229	And I'm not being shady.
3927150	3931471	Again, I have bought things off of the service for exactly this reason.
3931592	3933192	I want to be able to play them in the future.
3933652	3942897	I'm just saying this feels a little bit like, you know, the bail bondsman advertisements outside the courthouse.
3945098	3948059	It's taking an opportunity in the situation.
3950366	3953547	DJ Ranma S says, so are you calling BS or are you not buying this?
3953627	3954207	Buying what?
3954888	3958089	They're committing to what they've always been doing, as far as I'm aware.
3958529	3960970	Unless, is there something new in this that I'm missing?
3962210	3970293	No, they've always been, I remember a few years ago, they put Diablo 1 on the service for 10 bucks and I believe it's still there.
3970693	3974294	And I believe it's on the list of the 100 games, is the original Diablo.
3974794	3978758	This was a big deal because it was like, well, why isn't Battle.net doing this?
3978778	3982903	But for whatever reason, GOG has it on their platform and they did a fine job.
3984568	3988690	Bobby says they're doing the tech support instead of the original publisher.
3989450	3993852	And haven't they always kind of had to do that to make the games run on their system?
3994592	4004016	I guess if that is the news that they are saying, we're dedicating XYZ employees to patching up these old games to make them work, then cool, I guess, but...
4005318	4013525	I'm just saying it feels a little bit like they see a movement and they're taking advantage of the movement, which is what capitalists do.
4014366	4018730	I'm not saying they're like, oh my God, this is a completely unethical, horrible company.
4018790	4025896	No, but I'm just saying it just seems to me that this is just a bunch of marketing language.
4026857	4033000	But great, if they're making a commitment to make old games playable on all future hardware, I don't see how that's a bad thing.
4033420	4038503	But at the same time, if the company ever goes under someday, this is all for naught, isn't it?
4040584	4043666	So, is it really forever?
4047213	4051135	Well, I'll tell you what is forever, and that is Half-Life 2.
4051595	4054477	That's right, that game is forever and ever and ever.
4055037	4060880	And Half-Life 2 just celebrated its 20th anniversary this past week, which I can't fucking believe.
4061961	4066703	But I can't, you know, is this game, is this show older than Half-Life 2?
4067183	4068064	It really is, isn't it?
4068644	4070225	Yeah, we're older than dirt.
4070265	4071126	Son of a bitch.
4071587	4073708	All right, so Half-Life 2.
4074489	4076571	I think our show is older than some of our listeners.
4077271	4088521	Anyway, this show, or this show, this game turned 20 years old this past week, and so they released Half-Life 2 Episode 3 in our hearts, in our minds, in our fantasies.
4089261	4090783	No, they did not release that, but...
4091738	4119932	they did kind of zhuzh up the original game and they released alongside it a documentary and they talked in the documentary about why isn't there a third episode for Half-Life 2 and basically it boils down to a need to work on other Valve titles at the time because they went to go work on Left 4 Dead is where the team that was working on Half-Life 2 went and then by the time they were ready to go back to Episode 3 the argument was made that we missed it
4120552	4140755	so basically like the opportunity had come and gone and you know one of the developers in the documentary says we could have gone back and spent two years to make episode three and this is where Gabe Newell chimes in and says my personal failure was being stumped I couldn't figure out why doing episode three was pushing anything forward
4141491	4144253	I couldn't figure out how to count to the number three.
4157455	4161077	Fuck you, fans who have been waiting for the resolution to this story.
4161897	4163518	No, I'm being dramatic.
4163558	4164258	I'm being mean.
4164418	4176063	I understand, in all seriousness, when you are a creative person, if you're not feeling that creative motivation behind something,
4177184	4181648	I guess they had all these concepts which show up in the documentary and all that stuff too, which is cool.
4182008	4184890	But I guess they weren't loving the ice gun and loving these things.
4184950	4191656	And if creatively you're not really passionate about what it is you're making, then you don't really want to make it.
4192257	4200043	And I can respect that, but I'm also kind of like, damn, there's just a lot of people who are just left in the cold with this whole thing.
4200083	4201725	And that part's kind of a bummer.
4202905	4232268	um but if you want to check out Half-Life 2 they it is it is episode one episode two along with the base game available on Steam now there's uh Steam workshop support available and all that good stuff videos of the demos from E3 so it basically it's their own kind of criterion version if you will of Half-Life I mean you know we were just talking about how Digital Eclipse did their version and maybe Nintendo could do their own version someday well this in a way is Valve's version of this for Half-Life
4232668	4249882	with the documentary and all that other stuff so and then of course you know the whole thing ends with the like we'll never say never type of thing when it comes to Half-Life and now that you've asked about it it's gonna be another 20 years
4253133	4261699	I would have laughed if they have, you know how everyone always said with Valve time, anytime you mention a Half-Life 3 remake, it pushes it back this much time.
4261719	4262059	I know.
4262119	4267503	It'd be funny if in the documentary they show this elaborate computer system that's calculating that.
4267963	4269224	The clock keeps going up.
4269284	4269504	It's like...
4272636	4275377	We told you, like, you just didn't listen.
4275457	4278158	Now it's not coming out for another 2,000 years.
4278238	4278559	Sorry.
4279239	4280079	Some comments in chat.
4280139	4282680	DarkTetsuya says, I did buy it when it last went on sale.
4283000	4285782	Yeah, I imagine a lot of y'all probably picked up this game at some point.
4285822	4293245	Go check your Steam libraries and see if it got a big old update on the back end because it probably did, you know, with all this extra stuff.
4293325	4294005	So check it out.
4294765	4299649	I know Alan, my husband, loves Half-Life and usually revisits the old games once a year.
4300049	4301551	He'll do a complete playthrough of them.
4301871	4307636	He likes to do mods and what was the whole Black Mesa, I think was like the reinvention of Part 1?
4308256	4309837	They're doing a new game too.
4310058	4312499	Wasn't there like Blue Shift?
4312580	4313440	That might be the new game.
4314821	4317704	That was an old, I think, mod for it?
4317864	4318324	Oh, maybe.
4318684	4323068	I wasn't too much into Half-Life when it first came out.
4323248	4325429	You want to write Half-Life 2 Episode 3?
4352102	4366296	I could write a game and let somebody else do all the other work for me If I wrote Half-Life 2 Episode 3 it would look like the game that's playing behind Loki right now on stream No, that's creating the game I'm talking about writing the story for the game
4367799	4382371	because if I can sit down and write a 40 chapter supernatural fanfic that has over 2,000 to 3,000 words per chapter, I think I can write a video game synopsis and story.
4382752	4384893	To be fair though, you're probably not the first.
4385054	4387876	The internet's a big place and I'm sure... Oh, I'm sure.
4388136	4390338	But I could write the proposal for me writing it for them.
4391809	4397211	OrangeRite in chat brings up Blue Shift and Opposing Force, the two expansion packs to Half-Life 1.
4397551	4398311	That's how it all fits in.
4398712	4403733	And then S2100Matt actually links us to this Steam store page for Project Borealis.
4404053	4410216	It is kind of cool that all those sorts of fan projects do kind of get Valve's blessing in a way with that.
4410656	4413997	It's nice that at least they aren't shutting down Nintendo.
4414937	4437709	fan projects based on their old IP sorts of things I do appreciate that sometimes they hire the fan project people Nintendo I think Valve does a lot of good stuff there that maybe other companies in Washington should take notes who may actually be based in Japan but have major satellite offices across the street in Washington alright moving on Loki
4438868	4441490	What are they doing in Irvine at Blizz headquarters?
4445148	4447229	There's rumors of what they may be doing.
4448329	4454632	So, of course, a job listing just spoiling all the things over.
4455732	4460854	They have a job listing for design director of innovation, which is extremely generic.
4461615	4469798	But it says you'll be the vision holder and owner over key strategic innovations on an upcoming open world shooter game.
4471417	4473719	Sounds like they're working on an open world shooter game.
4473779	4487431	There was rumors a while back that apparently the previous Far Cry 5 director Dan Hay was working at Blizzard and developing a title in the StarCraft universe, but we'll see.
4487591	4488131	Who knows?
4488672	4490574	Is Ghost coming back?
4490954	4492675	Will we get the StarCraft Ghost finally?
4493036	4493376	Maybe?
4493556	4494998	My brain's also like, wasn't
4495950	4520045	Project Titan which bits and pieces of it became Overwatch wasn't Project Titan supposed to be an open world shooter kind of maybe I think it was I think it might have been a little bit different but like I know the the PvP and Overwatch was like one mode about when you were like contesting a zone or something and they ended up making that like the actual game is where Overwatch was kind of born out of Titan so uh story just like uh yeah like um
4520834	4522474	Fortnite, yeah.
4523055	4523875	Yeah, kind of.
4524535	4526116	Battle Royale, yeah.
4526296	4527456	Interesting.
4527476	4532397	Yeah, and a lot of people are responding to this going, why don't they just make a StarCraft 3?
4533638	4537319	And some people are sort of responding with... Because they still haven't made a StarCraft 2.
4537379	4541880	No, they did finish StarCraft 2, but they did it across four games.
4542100	4544021	Is it really StarCraft 2, though?
4544201	4544461	I mean...
4544844	4573008	well you know and and some people are wondering is there space for an RTS again in uh you know the modern gaming world is there space for an RTS to be successful I I or is the market too niche for that sort of thing um I don't know I don't know the answer to that but I think it's disappointing I think they could I could they could do RTS stuff I mean I don't think there's like there's a lot of games that they say oh they're not gonna do well and stuff like look at even um
4574192	4577333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4594337	4613727	I can understand where no matter what they do if they were to make StarCraft 3 a pure RTS there are always going to be the people always who are loudly going to say this fucking sucks compared to the original why don't you just play the fucking original and that voice might be getting what they want
4615138	4615638	Guess what?
4615758	4620319	The original and part two for what it's worth, those two games, that is all you're going to have.
4620759	4625060	If you want to go play those games, go play them because they're going to go a different direction with StarCraft.
4625480	4626661	This is kind of interesting to me.
4627581	4638843	I mean, this is all based on speculation anyway, but it does seem like StarCraft is the series we're sort of due to get an update on out of Blizzard because it's been a little while now.
4638983	4642704	We sort of just assume, well, they got to be cooking up something in the StarCraft universe because...
4642824	4650946	What if they're trying to do something like Helldivers 2 but with the StarCraft universe or something like that?
4651886	4662289	Yeah, you know, Blizzard just has to take... Blizzard is always really good at taking a popular, you know, computer party game type of thing and really streamlining it for a bigger crowd.
4662569	4664509	I mean, that's literally what World of Warcraft was.
4665090	4666510	To some extent, that's what Diablo was.
4666530	4668070	That's absolutely what Overwatch was.
4668670	4669931	You know, it's... Yeah.
4670371	4670571	Anyway.
4671485	4673606	Yeah, be interesting what happens with it.
4674726	4677907	Bonds006 in chat says, LOL, you're calling me out on that, Rob.
4677987	4680708	Leave me alone with my StarCraft 1 and Brood Wars.
4681268	4686050	I mean, there are a lot of people... StarCraft 3 will never be good enough for a lot of fans.
4686550	4689051	And so maybe that's why they're just not going to make it.
4689191	4689591	You won.
4689751	4690231	Congrats.
4690311	4691611	They're not going to... Congrats.
4691871	4693052	You get the original forever.
4693592	4699174	And they did remaster the original at some point, which some people have opinions on, but...
4700174	4705435	it's there and I imagine that is what the future will be remasters of the first two games so
4706621	4711483	Anyway, well, speaking of all of that, we also got Warcraft updates this week.
4711903	4724247	Funny enough, I feel like with the amount of Blizzard-related updates this week, I felt like we got all the news this week that would have been released had there been a BlizzCon, but there wasn't this year.
4724787	4727788	So we kind of got... Did anybody else notice?
4727808	4730829	Like, we got an awful lot of Blizzard news dumps this week out of the blue.
4730849	4731449	Yeah.
4731929	4736251	So yeah, I felt like this was like the what would have been BlizzCon news.
4736371	4741293	And yeah, it probably wasn't enough to justify an entire convention around it, which is why they went this direction.
4741333	4744175	But anyway, we got some updates on World of Warcraft.
4744195	4754960	But before I get to those, let me mention, because literally was just talking about RTS games and remasters, the original Warcraft and Warcraft 2 were fully remastered.
4755620	4784742	and they are now available, were stealth dropped this week, so we didn't even know that Blizzard was working on these, they just released full on fucking remasters of Warcraft 1 and 2, done so they're out on Battle.net now if you want to check that out and if they knew that you had the old games because they were registered to your Battle.net account, congrats, you got the free upgrade, so you can play whatever yeah, that's the way to do it, that's pretty cool also, Warcraft 3 Reforged
4785262	4796228	was revisited to improve the visuals and I'm assuming some of the feedback because remember Warcraft 3 Reforged did not land quite as resoundingly as I think Blizzard was hoping.
4796669	4809376	Granted, it came right at the wrong time for Blizzard when they were really in the thick of all of the issues they were dealing with internally and some of the worst of the worst stuff we saw in game development culture was happening there.
4809956	4811218	Warcraft 3 Reforged Warcraft 1, 2, and 3
4824773	4828035	Aziz updates to these different games going on there.
4828535	4844923	Now, the other big, big news that came out of the Warcraft universe is that World of Warcraft did some minor updates talking about what's coming for the current expansion, but they actually revealed a big new feature coming to the next expansion, which we already know is World of Warcraft Midnight.
4845283	4851246	Because remember, they gave this whole, we got our 10-year timeline and it's going to be these three expansions.
4851946	4852987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4870504	4872827	is known for, and that is player housing.
4873147	4876151	So player housing will be coming to World of Warcraft.
4876191	4878754	And I know some people are going to be very excited about that.
4879755	4890046	Jamie, I have no idea if you ever want to play World of Warcraft again, but I could see you decorating your own house because I will never forget your house in Animal Crossing and your basement shrine to fire.
4891008	4891268	Yeah.
4892392	4898954	Well, I've recreated that a number of times in things, so who knows?
4899094	4899515	Who knows?
4899555	4903516	So maybe the Shrine to Fire in World of Warcraft someday.
4903556	4903856	Who knows?
4903916	4912259	But anyway, they released a teaser trailer about it, so they didn't say a lot else about it, except that they're going to need until the next expansion to do it.
4912859	4918261	And of course, they were asked, so if this isn't coming until midnight, why are you announcing this now?
4918821	4920442	Well, in an interview with PC Gamer...
4921182	4949350	uh the Warcraft director Ion Hazacostas said we wanted to give players a little sneak preview of some of what the team is cooking this also gives us the chance I think to have more open conversations about it that aren't possible when it's a top secret feature feature so they want to hear what people are excited about what they expect and what they'd like to see from housing so that could be very interesting I would say the biggest drawback in 14 is that because of the um kind of
4949890	4954993	Age server infrastructure that datebacks to the horrific 1.0 that that game is kind of stuck on.
4955414	4957895	Not everybody that wants a house can get one.
4958055	4960036	And that is the biggest drawback of the feature in 14.
4960977	4962898	And I feel like that's what you need to fix in WoW.
4963238	4966741	And I will say this, you know, and as much as I have...
4967421	4968382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4990111	5018682	I don't think it would really be that I mean yeah you have to save all of the the variants of the same thing but as far as network it could just be its own instance I'm just trying to think because I think that the reason why all that would be limited is because you are having X number of database elements available
5020276	5026861	and all of that is going to take storage, even if just saying, you know, load item here, load item here, load item here.
5026901	5029944	It's a lot of, you know, just mostly code and text, right?
5030084	5030324	Right.
5031025	5031265	But
5032711	5046165	Think about then that when that instance loads, it's not only having however much that just the code itself is going to take up, but it's going to have to load every item in there.
5046386	5053193	It would then have to be really creative about how to implement it for everybody because there are so many working parts in the background.
5053433	5054354	Yeah, that makes sense.
5054494	5058579	And I wonder if, you know, again, we don't know what it looks like until we see it.
5058739	5067749	I wonder if player housing, because we've seen the like the garrisons were something they implemented a long time ago, which was sort of like a player base.
5068430	5069191	I still have my house, I think.
5091389	5096955	I mean, I haven't played in two years, but... Then you don't have your house anymore because they will delete... After I paid for it.
5097376	5100619	They auto-demolish every 45 days if you don't set foot in your house.
5101200	5102161	After I paid for it.
5104824	5105224	What do you mean?
5106506	5108828	Well, I saved up a lot in-game to buy my house.
5108988	5110130	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5110170	5111551	You'll get a refund of some of it.
5111631	5112232	Pfft.
5113703	5115224	That game's just not worth me playing anymore.
5115264	5116245	That's what pissed Alan.
5116265	5119368	That's why Alan Rage quit the game is they deleted his house because he hadn't played in so long.
5119388	5120469	He was like, well, fuck this game then.
5122391	5126875	And that's why I'm like, it would be something that they could get needled on.
5126895	5128917	But yeah, technically it is an undertaking.
5129377	5129758	I get it.
5129838	5130178	I get it.
5130699	5130919	All right.
5131039	5133621	Palio, where my whole game is building my damn house.
5133821	5134342	Yeah.
5135478	5150072	All right, well, moving on, let's talk about another story that has to do with some information that came out from an interview this week from Hideki Itsuno, who, of course, used to be at Capcom and is now no longer there.
5150732	5154736	And he left Capcom and, you know, folks were...
5155797	5156178	I had a sniffle.
5173434	5176736	So, he of course is left to start a new studio.
5176776	5178477	It's called Lightspeed Studios.
5179037	5182158	And that is, you know, it's an exciting new chapter for me.
5182579	5184179	We've got strong development capability.
5184480	5189822	We're going to create an original AAA action game titles and yay, you know, all of that stuff to do there.
5190923	5191743	He did say though-
5194605	5196506	Yeah, well, who knows?
5196526	5196806	Who knows?
5197206	5202669	But it kind of dug up an old interview where he said, if I was allowed, I'd love to make Rival Schools 3.
5203289	5208591	I'd love to make Dragon's Dogma 2, Capcom vs. SNK 3, Street Fighter Alpha 4, Power Stone 3.
5209411	5211832	If I could, even Street Fighter 6 would be amazing.
5211912	5213993	Again, this was before there actually was a Street Fighter 6.
5214373	5214833	He said this.
5215274	5217995	But the one we need to get resolution on is Rival Schools.
5219039	5241050	which I'm sure Jamie has something to say about that so if I had the voice I'm thinking it really loudly yeah exactly so um but yeah he has he's moved on to establish that studio and there's um some you know interviews coming out about that um yeah I guess a scenario for Rival Schools 3 was actually completed all the way back in 2000 but just did not get to see the light of day
5242250	5246754	Just like I was reading today, things that were canceled without ever seeing the light of day.
5247234	5250597	Did you know John Waters was set to make his first movie in 20 years?
5251017	5251337	20 years.
5251878	5253439	A Dirty Shame came out 20 years ago.
5253759	5255460	And he was set to make a brand new movie.
5255520	5258203	And do you know who was going to be the star of this John Waters movie?
5258583	5262726	The perfect, the literal perfect modern day celebrity for a John Waters movie.
5263367	5265228	Aubrey Plaza was set to star in this movie.
5265268	5265828	Oh, I would love it.
5267430	5268531	That would have been good.
5268671	5270372	Nobody will give him the money to make it.
5270652	5271033	Nobody.
5272168	5272709	Kickstarter.
5274030	5275551	Oh my god, that's actually a great idea.
5275791	5277253	John Waters, I will give you money.
5280316	5282518	I mean, it's work for other things.
5283078	5284460	That's actually a really good idea.
5284540	5285260	He should try.
5285361	5285901	He should try.
5287423	5288243	Anyway, alright.
5289364	5289985	Let's see.
5290746	5297092	Loki, why don't we move on to yeah, we kind of surprise re-releases of remasters, right?
5297112	5297192	Yeah.
5297870	5300651	Yeah, it's more of a surprise update, I should say.
5300751	5309496	The Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Definitive Edition wasn't very definitive before when it was hastily ported by Grocery Games.
5310656	5315339	Whether, I'm sure, it was a lack of time, money, skill, whatever the case may be, it was a mess.
5316139	5339334	um however though between that time since it was released a while ago and now um this new update it was released on and I believe mobile platforms as part of one of the Netflix games uh they're like game library or whatever and these were actually developed by uh Video Game Deluxe
5340880	5343204	who had ported L.A.
5344125	5346008	Noire to the VR platforms.
5346729	5347210	And so...
5348513	5352817	The thought here is I think that I don't know if Grove Street worked on updates for this.
5353738	5367410	There's been some comments made by them because first off, one of the updates that came through with this is that their name has been taken out of the intro, the title screen for the game.
5367611	5369592	It's only been relegated to the credits.
5370774	5373136	So they're not happy about that being removed.
5373696	5382283	but that these patches were done a long time ago and Rockstar sat on them essentially until it just recently came out.
5382404	5383484	So what did it fix?
5383765	5386707	What are some of the updates that they had I think on mobile?
5387348	5388028	Better lighting.
5388168	5394894	So the lighting in FOG is similar to what is in the original games.
5395374	5396676	They've fixed
5397276	5425641	some of the issues with character models and whatnot they've also built in a system where you can run and fire your gun at the same time like the modern Grand Theft Auto games but apparently you couldn't do this in the older versions and also now this has been updated on essentially all the different platforms so now you can enjoy it I don't know if I want to touch it still because it's been touched by it's like too many cooks in the kitchen at this point
5427932	5429253	but I'm glad it's getting better.
5431213	5432674	I'm not paying Rockstar for this stuff.
5434655	5437416	Yeah, why would Rockstar sit on it?
5438117	5440898	They have to release this for the holiday season or something?
5440998	5441838	Well, I don't know.
5441918	5447581	Maybe it was a deal that they had with Netflix to put the game on their platform or whatever.
5447641	5454684	Maybe there's some exclusivity deal and so whatever updates they did, maybe that's the version of the game.
5454984	5455985	Kind of think of it like...
5457438	5457958	What was it?
5458158	5459439	Amico kind of had the same policy.
5459459	5463121	It's like, you can release a copy of the game on other platforms, but it can't be the same.
5463141	5465642	It has to be a unique thing on our platform.
5466022	5467763	So maybe that was the deal.
5467943	5473185	I don't know, but at least it's fixed now, or mostly fixed.
5473585	5473885	Okay.
5474245	5474586	Interesting.
5475973	5482415	Alright, well, before we get to our next segment, I want to do one more story that comes out of Blizzard, because again, there was a lot of news this week.
5482535	5493719	Actually, this is a little more about the Microsoft-Blizzard marriage, because one of the big games coming out of Microsoft, or specifically Obsidian, that I think a lot of people are looking forward to.
5493779	5494859	I know I want to check this out.
5494959	5496380	It's a game called Avowed.
5497100	5499821	It's an RPG that's coming from Obsidian, who makes some good RPGs.
5499841	5500721	That's why I want to check it out.
5501061	5502462	And it's coming out on February 18th.
5504059	5523322	the unique news involving Blizzard that came out this week is that Avowed is going to be available on Battle.net now this is the first I believe Microsoft property to show up on Battle.net now we know that when the Activision merger happened we saw Call of Duty I think um
5523863	5524183	Call of Duty
5539339	5540300	Okay, but it's there.
5540540	5540920	Whatever.
5541941	5545063	But this is interesting that Avowed is also going to be on Battle.net.
5545123	5546624	Not exclusively on Battle.net.
5546884	5547885	It's still on Steam.
5548205	5549927	It's still on the Game Pass launcher.
5550047	5551187	It's still all these other places.
5551548	5555170	But they are doing an intentional sort of awareness campaign within Battle.net.
5556071	5556911	At least I can say this.
5557352	5561915	This one makes way more sense than Call of Duty did because this is another RPG.
5562295	5565918	This is probably something that's going to speak to a lot of the same type of fan base.
5565998	5567499	I can see the overlap here.
5567819	5570040	Why do I need it on a different launcher?
5570920	5571900	You don't.
5572100	5576061	I mean, I guess if you go to BattleNet, maybe it makes sense.
5576781	5578322	Well, I would say this, Loki.
5578402	5581983	This is for people that have a computer just to play World of Warcraft.
5582103	5585824	And yes, those people absolutely exist because I used to know them when I played WoW heavily.
5586604	5593406	So this is to try to target that audience, much in the way that Blizzard products have always tried to kind of target that audience.
5594126	5599427	by launching on Battle.net and cross-pollinating.
5599867	5605289	I think Blizzard does this in a way I wish most companies would do, sort of raise awareness around their own games.
5605329	5609030	I've talked forever about how Niantic needs to stop existing in silos.
5609530	5614811	It's ridiculous as fuck that Pokemon Go doesn't have the same quality of life improvements that Monster Hunter now has.
5615131	5617532	And it's almost like the two companies don't even fucking talk to each other.
5617952	5618892	So, like, they're...
5619893	5628281	I think there are some things that Blizzard does very well that now you see with this Microsoft merger, Microsoft would like to leverage for the launch of Avowed.
5628722	5630123	But here's the other funky thing.
5630984	5633406	Avowed is going to be a Game Pass game.
5633967	5636850	So if you have Avowed, you will have it on Game Pass.
5637911	5640454	I'm assuming it has to be the ultimate or the high level tier or whatever.
5641670	5654743	what's on sale now on Battle.net is the limited edition versions of the game so if you want to get the $90 premium edition of the game you will be able to play 5 days early
5655652	5656933	and you get some other extra crap.
5656973	5658015	Have we not learned?
5658035	5658936	And all that other stuff.
5660017	5661779	I am with you there, Loki.
5661859	5662840	Have we not learned?
5662880	5666364	Because that early access shit has torpedoed a lot of games.
5666964	5671589	However, I will point out this game was delayed from its original launch window.
5671609	5673531	It doesn't matter.
5673591	5674712	I know, I know, but it's just...
5675663	5678565	They are making sure it's fine-tuned, but I do agree with you.
5679225	5696495	I will also point out, because logging into my own Battle.net account to play Diablo 4, a game which I play a lot, I have gotten the marketing messages for Avowed that say, included with your Game Pass, upgrade to Premium Edition now for $25.00.
5699496	5701397	I don't know if I've seen that one.
5702078	5714965	So what they're selling in this is if you are a Game Pass subscriber, you can instead of paying $90, pay $25, which isn't even the right amount.
5715025	5716906	It's supposed to be $20, but I digress.
5717367	5724791	Pay $25 to upgrade the one you're going to get with Game Pass to play it five days early and get the cosmetic shit.
5725441	5743632	well they're just trying to sell more DLC because that's the thing with Game Pass is like they discount certain tiers of things they discount DLC as well and they're just trying to siphon any money that they can from their Game Pass users I will say as much as I kind of look at that and go
5744585	5745245	Fucking really?
5746566	5748368	Not for me.
5748448	5755252	But again, if the splash image had been for Diablo 5, I would have been like, click, click, click, click, click.
5755532	5760716	Just because I can admit when my fandom is weak and I will buy things I shouldn't be buying.
5761276	5763638	But in the case of Avowed, I don't think I'm there.
5763958	5766680	But I will absolutely play Avowed when it comes out.
5766700	5767881	I'm looking forward to it, in fact.
5767921	5773664	But I will wait to get my version that I've already paid for with my Game Pass monthly sub on the ultimate level.
5773704	5774385	Thank you very much.
5775146	5801749	yeah but it's just interesting because I don't think I've seen a whole like bridge your game pass subscription to the ultimate edition for 25 bucks I just thought that was interesting yeah there's a few people in chat I noticed they're looking forward to this as well QuestBuster says I'm definitely looking forward to this one Mishkins in chat says I'm excited for this one yeah I am too but obviously they're gonna milk every dollar hopeful yeah
5802165	5802945	for this one.
5803046	5804807	We'll see how it actually turns out.
5805127	5806107	Yeah, absolutely.
5806187	5806528	Absolutely.
5806968	5807208	All right.
5807328	5811150	Well, anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when, you know what?
5811531	5816794	You just paid for the cost of the game and DLC didn't fucking exist.
5816894	5818415	Let's roll the bumper for our next segment.
5828984	5836291	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5836772	5839314	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5839874	5841576	Actually, I might have to eat my words.
5841736	5844078	I think this one may have had DLC.
5844198	5848002	I forget that 10 years was not a long time ago.
5848422	5851225	But DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5852458	5854279	Edmund McMillan and Florian Hensel
5874810	5879052	And it came out on Windows first, and then Mac OS X and Linux.
5880113	5887076	And it is inspired by the story of The Binding of Isaac, but in the game, of course, it's different.
5888737	5894200	It's his mom who gets the message demanding the life of her son as proof of her faith.
5894760	5911385	and Isaac runs away from home so you also have access to six other unlockable characters procedurally generated and it's kind of like a nod to Legend of Zelda but there's a reason why it's like that
5913911	5935327	The game actually was a result of a game jam with McMillan and Hensel to do a Zelda-inspired roguelike that McMillan could use to show his feelings about religion, mostly because of conflicts between his Catholic and Protestant family members.
5936828	5943193	Um, and, and he also I mean this was, he took the chance because of the success of Super Meat Boy.
5944534	5950418	And he didn't expect many, many sales but it really gained popularity after Let's Play videos.
5953860	5965629	So they did have an expansion called Wrath of the Lamb in May 2012, but they were limited because Flash was dying at the time.
5966610	5973775	So they started working with Nintendo for a 3DS version, but Nintendo backed out over the religious themes.
5974796	5987143	So they did a remake in 2014, still timely, called The Binding of Isaac Rebirth and it brought in the extra features that they wanted to have that was limited in the Flash version.
5987823	5999709	Improved the graphics and enabled ports to other systems including PS4, Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, 3DS, and Nintendo Switch.
6000670	6002831	So I guess Nintendo eventually relented.
6003651	6007754	And it's been even rated as one of the best roguelikes of all time.
6008595	6014720	And Macmillan worked with James Id to do The Legend of Bumbo as a prequel to The Binding of Isaac.
6015881	6016861	So that's been there.
6017021	6021645	So it is a top-down dungeon crawler presenting in two-dimensional sprites.
6022305	6025968	It flows a lot like The Legend of Zelda, where you have...
6028730	6053816	you still have the randomly generated rooms like a roguelike but you have to fight monsters and um you also can you know play this sort of like a twin-stick shooter like it reminded me when I played it as a marriage between um Zelda and Smash TV does that make sense um having played the game yes it makes sense
6055066	6065369	You do pick up different power-ups like pills or tarot cards to refill your life or change your attributes.
6065649	6069350	Some of the effects will stack, so you could become a real badass.
6070470	6076032	You are tracked by the number of hearts, and if you lose all of your hearts, the game is a permadeath.
6076052	6078012	You have to start over in a fresh dungeon.
6078912	6079672	You have a boss...
6082053	6109700	and the main boss is Isaac's mom there's an optional ninth floor which is called Shale which it's not hell if anyone tries to tell you that it's actually called a place of stillness and darkness like an empty place where souls go and your boss is Satan which again that's I guess the Christian version of Satan
6111144	6127897	but anyway so you win the game with certain conditions and you get new power-ups as you go through and it'll track your power-ups as you progress so there are a lot of
6129777	6133821	It definitely is not exactly the biblical story.
6133841	6134761	I'll just leave it there.
6136763	6142828	But the way that the story goes is that the mom hears the voice from above, which she thinks is God.
6143509	6148593	And the voice says that her son is corrupted with sin and needs to be saved.
6149374	6166654	and to remove all the sin she takes away all of his toys and drawings his clothes and then says that he must be cut off from all the evil so he's locked in his room and then you know it just basically keeps asking more and more until she's ready to sacrifice him and then you know he runs away
6167675	6194318	so there is an expansion The Binding of Isaac Repentance that had actually a real conclusion of the story but before that came out there were no real conclusions and then the cutscenes between through two of the levels or the different floors Isaac is shown curled up in a ball crying and you can see his thoughts but yeah the
6195508	6197969	It's really quite the interesting game.
6198669	6220396	And he, McMillan, when designing the game, he was considering using the scare tactics the Christian right used to condemn the pop, you know, things like heavy metal video games as, I guess, opponent ideas in the game.
6221636	6224497	And then, you know, weird stuff like toilet humor, you know.
6225077	6230019	It was basically things that might piss off his family, which I thought was funny.
6230439	6234641	But it was originally made in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2.
6235261	6237802	And then they could bring it out as a game on Steam.
6238963	6241404	And it took off.
6242024	6247466	The demo version of the Steam release was released on Newgrounds.
6249907	6268017	and so it's been out in various capacities and since AS2 is outdated it could slow down a bunch of different computers and let controllers support so when the new release came out it had
6268537	6269137	a bunch better.
6270077	6276999	Merge Games did a physical edition of the game that had the game soundtrack and a poster for the UK in 2012.
6278740	6287462	So the soundtrack was done by Danny Baranowski who had worked with Macmillan on Super Meat Boy and
6289022	6300930	I finally were able to, you know, with some cooperation, get the soundtrack made and they wanted to put out a dark tone but with some silly undertones so it wouldn't be taken too seriously.
6301571	6313399	But some of the songs were inspired by choral music and others, especially for boss fights, were inspired by Uematsu for Final Fantasy music.
6314940	6335497	there was a cancelled Nintendo 3DS port for the original but as we learned later on it came out because Steve Singer who is the vice president of licensing and Mark Griffin a senior manager in licensing and Dan Adelman who is the head of indie development were all behind the game so
6336736	6339997	There was Wrath of the Lamb that came out May 28, 2012.
6341158	6349901	And it was an expansion because his wife completely completed the game and wanted more.
6350481	6353322	It was like, okay, you like the game, here's some more.
6353782	6365686	And it adds 70% more content to the original with more than 10 bosses, over 100 items, 40 unlocks, two endings, additional endings, and two additional optional levels and alternate floors.
6366601	6382936	so it is a pretty thing of course and then Rebirth came out that basically included all of the above plus and like I said came out of multiple systems and the second update after Afterbirth Plus allows for user mods that came out on January 3rd, 2027
6384517	6388398	The final update was Repentance and added new content and bug fixes.
6390058	6394579	Including a lot of the content from Antibirth, which was a fan-made expansion.
6395119	6402220	It had a new alternate path through the game and different variations that came out March 31st, 2021.
6404501	6408681	Of course, there was The Legend of Bumbo, which was the prequel.
6411262	6411422	And
6414012	6438413	Isaac and Gish both appear in the game Gish is another character and Isaac also was a playable character in Blade Strangers fighting game and the puzzle game Crystal Crisis it was announced in 2018 there's a card game adaptation with Studio 71 called The Biting of Isaac for Souls so Metacritic gave this game an 84 out of 100 based on 30 reviews
6440981	6445697	and he wasn't expecting anything the game super took off and
6447220	6453444	I'm not going to read all of the accolades over it, but I can tell you by November 2021, the game had sold over a million copies.
6454225	6458948	And a quarter of those were partly due to the Wrath of the Lamb extension.
6460069	6464972	2024, the game sold over 3 million.
6464992	6476560	2015, after Rebirth, the game moved up to 5 million sold, and it also led the way for other roguelikes to come out, like Don't Starve and FTL.
6477200	6491240	so there you go all right thank you for the trip down memory lane even if a little bit recent but not that recent and it's one of those games I seem to remember playing not that long ago but here we are the binding of Isaac
6492793	6499617	Yeah, I'm with SSJ100 Matt in chat that says, I feel like this is one of those games along with Super Meat Boy that was in a lot of humble bundles.
6499737	6500857	Yeah, it definitely was.
6501538	6504059	I think I had bought this when it first came out, though.
6504299	6505800	I remember digging the Zelda vibes.
6506340	6512783	Somewhere in there, Jamie, you said it was like Zelda mixed with Smash TV, and I'm kind of, yeah, that's a pretty accurate description of what it is.
6512904	6513964	Like the gunning part?
6514204	6515005	Yeah, exactly.
6515545	6515665	Okay.
6515885	6518907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6540183	6546949	Actual engagement on a social media platform that doesn't have people I don't want to hear from in the replies.
6547950	6549431	Isn't that fucking wild?
6550452	6550992	So wild.
6551693	6552073	Wild.
6552173	6553074	Anyway, we'll get to that in a minute.
6553094	6555596	But first, some other quick news, Loki.
6556926	6558727	Alright, let's talk about some movie news.
6559588	6570895	So we've got word now that Sophie Turner from Game of Thrones fame is going to be playing Lara Croft for the upcoming Tomb Raider series.
6573136	6574157	So that's interesting.
6574617	6578079	I guess that's going to be something we'll see on Amazon.
6579940	6580320	Okay.
6581101	6581381	Neat.
6582142	6584303	I'm sorry for Sophie Turner.
6584343	6585964	You're going to have a very, very bad day.
6587102	6592285	based off of all those video games.
6592325	6596007	Hope you can do some really good stunts or have a really good stunt person subbing in.
6596148	6602211	I hope your stunts are up to par because if not, you're going to have a really, really bad day.
6602872	6604232	All in good fun.
6604553	6606634	That's going to be a fun show to see, so good luck to her.
6607628	6628279	yeah and then we've got word that Tom Hardy's uh or the uh I guess adaptation of Splinter Cell featuring Tom Hardy is cancelled no uh Splinter Cell movie I did not even know that was a thing good if I can't have John Waters you can't have your fucking Splinter Cell so fuck you exactly so alright neato
6631079	6631479	All right.
6633541	6642127	Okay, let's move on and talk about some... Oh, in this segment here with some rapid-fire news, some Black Friday sales we already know about.
6642627	6644528	I know you all love your cheap games.
6644588	6646770	I know I've got my eye on some things for Black Friday.
6647770	6653914	So some Black Friday sales... On one hand, yay, we have some games on sale already.
6654435	6658798	On the other hand, I need you all to fucking stop with Cyber November.
6658818	6658918	Okay?
6660285	6664947	Black Friday is bad enough being the day that it is.
6665528	6667889	It does not need to be a month-long event.
6668009	6668669	Best Buy.
6670050	6670610	You listening?
6670710	6671230	Best Buy?
6671891	6673351	Am I speaking with Mr. Best Buy?
6675793	6676413	Stop it.
6678311	6681655	If there's sales all the time, there's sales none of the time.
6681815	6682917	That's right, that's right.
6682957	6687762	The Christmas lights, or the holiday lights, whatever, do not go up until after Thanksgiving.
6688683	6691447	And Black Friday does not start until the day after Thanksgiving.
6692304	6695565	Remember, no discount will save you as much money as not buying it.
6715369	6728085	the biggest one is Tears of the Kingdom will be $20 off so it'll be down to $50 when you consider Nintendo never puts their shit on sale this is actually a big deal so you get that for $50 Pikmin 4, Super Mario Maker 2 down to $40
6730988	6732770	Animal Crossing down to $40.
6732970	6735373	I mean, who didn't already buy that game during COVID, but work.
6736213	6743661	Nintendo Switch Sports, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Odyssey, which is like one of the best Mario games they've made down to $30.
6744001	6746563	So if you still don't own that, there you go.
6747164	6749086	Pikmin 1 and 2 also down to $30.
6750947	6761790	and a full year of Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack.
6762230	6763331	So, there is that.
6763731	6767152	You know, and obviously, why are Nintendo doing all these deals?
6767712	6770413	Because the Switch is a lame duck console.
6771453	6777735	We know the successor is imminent and a lot of people buying consoles this holiday know that it's going to be imminent.
6779062	6787925	So I imagine there's a lot of people that are going to pass, unless maybe this is for a kid or some other type of family member who doesn't buy the games as fast.
6788265	6791466	But the Switch is on its way out, and I think we all know that.
6791526	6794727	So here's the deep discounts.
6795587	6797868	Now, how about Xbox Black Friday sales?
6797968	6799508	Yes, we have some of those as well.
6800788	6804890	If you still do not have the Halo Master Chief collection for some reason, that is down to $10.
6806872	6807512	Street Fighter 6 for $30
6835549	6855412	that's pretty good Pentament was down to $10 that's from its $20 release game Death Stranding Director's Cut $20 yes on Xbox that was the thing that happened Star Wars Outlaws $52 instead of $70 and then some other discounted games include Resident Evil 4
6856153	6858354	Techin8, and much more.
6858494	6860295	So yes, the sales are rolling in fast.
6860315	6863037	I'm sure there's others that have been announced that just haven't crossed my radar yet.
6863417	6867520	But if you are looking for some cheap deals and games, it's coming up.
6868440	6870621	Quest Buster endorsing Pentament in our chat.
6870681	6871522	I might have to check that out.
6871582	6873003	Pentament is so good.
6874143	6874483	So good.
6875444	6882008	Okay, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you'll pay full price for if you want to play them this week or not.
6883483	6884084	Or don't buy them.
6884124	6885084	It's your choice.
6885524	6886305	Just don't.
6886325	6887125	Just don't do it.
6887385	6888206	Just don't do it.
6889827	6891728	I feel like we've hit that era.
6892689	6895230	We all remember that campaign when we were kids growing up.
6895330	6895931	Just do it.
6896071	6896571	Nike, right?
6896611	6896991	Just do it.
6897291	6899833	Now we're kind of in that era of, or don't.
6899953	6900713	Just don't do it.
6902314	6904215	If you don't feel like doing something, just don't.
6904236	6907117	I mean, if you want to buy them on sale, you can.
6907177	6909359	But if you want to pay full price, you can also do that.
6909539	6909959	I don't care.
6909979	6910839	I'm not your parent.
6911220	6911660	Just don't.
6912674	6914015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6933246	6938107	I had full intention of buying Dragon Quest III HD 2D this week.
6938968	6940208	And then I saw it was $60.
6941368	6944709	And I said, Rob, how many hours are you really going to put in this game right now?
6944889	6945750	So I said, you know what?
6946030	6946690	Just don't do it.
6947750	6948170	And I didn't.
6948970	6949471	You know what?
6949691	6953852	I think a vow that I'm going to make for next year.
6953872	6954172	Mm-hmm.
6955023	6973543	is that I am not allowed to buy well especially this is kind of what I'm doing I can't I'm not gonna let myself buy any new video games or art supplies because that's my weakness until I have either used what I have or finished playing what I have and then
6975189	6979171	Also, I'm not going to get any more stuff until I've got my room organized.
6979871	6987935	But I think, you know, it's one thing, and this is actually getting to us now as seasoned gamers, right?
6990376	6995038	The big shiny stuff is awesome, but we're not going to necessarily be seduced by it.
6996079	6996279	Right?
6996299	6996399	Right.
6997583	7023196	and I think that that gives us freedom to get some of those little you know cheaper things that falls between the cracks if we want to try it and also to fully throw ourselves into what we're playing now to really enjoy what you have right in front of you that's what I'm trying to do anyway all right well let's see let's see what games will be tempted by this week Loki what's coming out in the U.S. ?
7024499	7030169	We have Maid Cafe on Electric Street on PC and consoles.
7030249	7032994	I'm going to assume all the big games came out last week.
7034702	7035743	I mean, you never know.
7035983	7036584	It could be big.
7036864	7039227	I like how it doesn't specify which consoles.
7039307	7040127	It's just consoles.
7040348	7041689	It's your console's console.
7042410	7043591	So hope you have one of those.
7043631	7045212	That's what we're going to have in the future.
7045252	7046754	It's just going to be called consoles.
7047074	7048716	They're all Nintendos now.
7048776	7049917	That's all the rage right now.
7049957	7052880	That's what the Switch 2 needs to adopt as its marketing campaign.
7053400	7055823	I'm your console's favorite console.
7058717	7059678	This is confusing.
7060698	7065040	Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PC and Xbox Series.
7065881	7069122	My Sims Cozy Bundle on Nintendo Switch.
7069863	7071824	Stray on Nintendo Switch.

7145952	7147033	Highly recommend that one, though.
7147053	7148793	The Divine Dynamo Flame Free.
7148813	7149593	I was like, what is that?
7149633	7150294	And I looked it up.
7150414	7151014	It looks cool.
7152793	7155354	Well, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.
7155454	7159414	So on the Nintendo Switch this week, Stray is getting a Japanese release on the Switch as well.
7159735	7161555	So you can check that out on the 19th of November.

7194129	7208098	That might be kind of fun Is also releasing in Japan this week Oh, it kind of looks like Theatrism a little bit Just a little bit Okay, that is out also this week in Japan And I think those are the big releases

7213167	7216870	And then the Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection comes out on the 22nd.
7216910	7220954	That looks like it's a worldwide release, but it's also hitting Japan on that day.
7221494	7224217	Looking at the PlayStation 5, I'm sure you're going to see a lot of crossover.
7224577	7226538	You're certainly going to be able to get some new hardware.
7226618	7230681	The new PlayStation 5 Slim 30th anniversary is out in Japan this week.
7231421	7232542	I think it is the rest of the world.
7232882	7236825	And a matching controller for matching service is out there as well.
7237305	7243829	Actually, other than that, that big console release is really the big release in Japan on the PlayStation 5 front.
7245070	7247131	I don't see any of those other games on the list.
7247171	7247892	That's pretty wild.
7248032	7248272	Okay.
7249312	7251614	Well, DarkSakura, we'll go to Europe then if you're up for it.

7305919	7306719	Spam, spam, spam, spam
7333095	7333636	You know what, though?
7334316	7335598	I do have to make a quick aside.
7335798	7336018	Please.
7338120	7345168	On Eddie Izzard's performance last night, there was a nod to Monty Python's I Don't Like Spam sketch.
7346689	7347290	That made me happy.
7348091	7349292	Continue, continue.
7350153	7350773	More headlines.
7350813	7351794	Just a couple more quick ones.
7351855	7352055	Loki.
7353581	7377446	you want free stuff for the holidays we get free stuff so we've now thanks to Epic Games they have now allowed the internet archive to have Unreal and Unreal Tournament be freely accessible and so now you can play those games for free they're very old but you can still play them for free
7378376	7404237	and that's awesome Brad yeah good job game preservation that's that's the way it ought to be it's great uh speaking of stuff that's free it's not officially on our list but I have a feeling a lot of our listeners would care to know that the Castlevania collection is the free game on the Epic Game Store this week now the downside is that means you have to have an Epic Game Store account but the upside is if you've already been suckered on one of their prior free game promotions or if you play Fortnite
7404577	7420761	you probably already have an account so go grab that Castlevania collection because that's all the classic ones it doesn't have like Symphony of the Night and that stuff that was on a later collection but it does have like the NES, Castlevania, Castlevania 4, 3, Simon's Quest I think the Game Boy one's in there
7421521	7448289	Kid Dracula randomly is in there so it's a really good mix and that's free on the Epic Store right now until Thursday so if you're hearing this either live on Sunday night or you're hearing it before Thursday reminder I would say tie a ribbon around your finger but since this is Castlevania tie a whip around your finger and get that old school Castlevania before Thursday
7449580	7454702	Unless you are morally opposed to the Epic Games Store, in which case, I'm sure there are plenty of other free games out there for you to play.
7455942	7460284	I'm sure it will end up in a Humble Monthly here soon enough.
7460364	7460604	Yeah.
7462325	7462585	It will.
7463512	7466174	Uh, well, thank you, DarkTetsuyu, who says, good on Rob for the shout out.
7466194	7466695	You're welcome.
7466715	7467615	Well, you know what?
7467675	7480485	When we say free games, we really should, I almost feel like in some ways, I don't want to propose major changes to the show structure, but I'm always like, maybe instead of talking about new releases, we should just talk about, here's the fucking free shit this week for you to go grab.
7482105	7483847	I mean, we could do that.
7483868	7493320	It's kind of more in line with Jamie's goal for next year as opposed to talking about what is new, available for you to spend a lot of money on.
7493641	7495864	Go blow up your backlog with more free shit.
7497432	7504876	That might be an interesting... Speaking of which, we should mention that Snakebird Complete is also on Epic Games Store right now.
7505436	7507958	I don't know what it is, but it's free and it looks neat.
7508258	7509519	That was already in my collections.
7509539	7511880	They've given it away before at some point, but that's alright.
7512761	7515722	Yeah, I mean, my library in Epic Games is pretty big.
7515802	7520045	I have a few things I did purchase, like Borderlands 3, Goat Simulator 3...
7521892	7548287	the only thing I paid money for besides Fortnite related things because I had to have that Ariana Grande skin just like DarkSakura the only thing I paid money for I also had to have Emma I got Tetris Effect when the PC version was out on Epic Game Store because it was exclusive there and when I got my machine that could do 4K games I was like what game do I want to play in 4K more than anything else and Tetris Effect was the winner
7549187	7551509	Yeah, Karim Baros for Raw K-City.
7551730	7554212	I've made a lot of mistakes on the Epic Games Store.
7556569	7559370	Portland 3 is alright, and Goat Simulator 3 is excellent.
7559451	7564574	I've been trying to grab, I think Goat Simulator 1 is next week or was last week or something, I think that was it.
7564674	7567416	It's out now, it's like 30 bucks though.
7567436	7568817	Oh, I thought that was an old game they were giving away.
7568837	7569698	Alright, well, whatever.
7570338	7574921	Yeah, because it just did the remaster, so it's, that just came out.
7576182	7582667	I mean, if, yeah, if Goat Simulator 3 ever hops into, I mean, it's just worth getting anyways, it's a stupid fun game.
7583146	7587750	On the Epic Store, they usually show you what next week's games are too, right next to the current week games.
7587870	7589471	It'll show you the next game.
7589631	7591053	Sometimes, yeah.
7591193	7595296	Next week is Beholder.
7596177	7596417	Okay.
7597398	7598038	I don't know what that is.
7598399	7602682	I don't either, but sometimes they release some indie games in there that are like, oh, I wish I'd seen this before.
7602822	7605785	I played some cute little space game that was that way.
7605865	7606986	I'd never heard of it until I played it.
7607006	7610849	Now, of course, I can't remember the name in the moment, but I've discovered some interesting games through that.
7611758	7611998	All right.
7612819	7622965	Well, hey, but when we talk about getting free games, we mean games that are like licensed to be free, not pirating games.
7623025	7626947	That is not something we endorse is pirating current games that are out there.
7627787	7628248	Yeah.
7628288	7631570	Do not do that type of piracy or else Nintendo will catch you.
7632190	7633811	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7656218	7670108	So what happened is that in 2023, Nintendo hired a law firm, Mitchell Silberberg and Knupp, to investigate free shops, which is what they call pirated Switch game stores online.
7670888	7682497	And this legal firm found Archbox and noted, here's some online postings that suggest that Archbox is near Phoenix, Arizona, and at one time into Midwestern University.
7683382	7690588	and then in 2015, a Reddit user called Archbox posted to a community called Switch Pirates.
7691208	7695552	So just a heads up, Reddit, Nintendo's watching you or Nintendo's legal arm is watching you.
7697153	7705539	Using a turtle avatar posted to r slash Phoenix saying that Midwestern University has an optometry clinic that is very good.
7705820	7708021	You get examined by a student and then the doctor.
7708362	7710103	So as you know,
7712359	7713180	and DarkSakura.com.
7728979	7745857	in about February of 2024 Nintendo succeeded linking the name Archbox to Nintendo accounts to the individual James Williams and apparently Nintendo had email addresses for this individual and repair orders
7746778	7757966	So this pirate at some point, alleged pirate, had apparently requested repairs from Nintendo, and they tied that all together because he lived in Surprise, Arizona, which is a suburb of Phoenix.
7758187	7758927	Surprise!
7759067	7759688	Surprise!
7759768	7763410	We have your address and all this supporting information.
7763971	7765392	Please enjoy your cease and desist.
7767642	7769443	That's pretty wild.
7769923	7783326	The moral of the story here is if you're going to commit piracy or do any sort of illegal things, don't use the same email that you use for everything else or the same profile name for everything else.
7783406	7783867	It's Reddit.
7783887	7785007	You can just spin up
7786280	7787302	A throwaway account?
7787502	7787803	Easy.
7787903	7788985	Why are you doing this?
7789285	7789485	Yeah.
7790227	7794173	Phil of Nine in chat says, Rob, I've seen your posts in the Nintendogs subreddit.
7794293	7794534	No.
7794614	7797999	In fact, I rarely... I don't remember the last time I made a post on Reddit.
7798140	7799302	It probably would have either been in...
7800928	7803650	Final Fantasy XIV subreddit, the Ingress subreddit.
7804350	7805711	You already know what shit I play.
7806031	7807972	Those are the reddits I'm probably looking at.
7808373	7810414	Probably something related to RuPaul's Drag Race.
7810714	7816197	And I stopped watching that show as frequently as I used to anyway several years ago.
7816618	7819179	I don't think I've made a post to reddit in a very long time to be honest.
7820880	7824202	And besides, Phil, it would not have been the Nintendogs subreddit.
7824242	7827564	It would have been the Nintendogs plus Cats subreddit.
7828865	7830526	Which was the superior version of the game.
7832701	7833981	All right.
7835182	7837722	Let's open it up to you all and some of the things you have to say.
7838882	7844464	If you want to email us for a future episode, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is a great place to do it.
7844804	7847564	And we appreciate all of the emails.
7847965	7852166	But in the interim, we're also getting a few folks that are following us now on Blue Sky.
7852206	7852766	Thank you very much.
7853126	7856547	You can follow us on Blue Sky at orangelaunchradio.com.
7856587	7857007	That's right.
7857047	7858227	You can actually have your domain.

7861210	7862532	So it's very easy to find us.
7862552	7863973	We're just at OrangeLondrina.com.
7864294	7866556	By the way, there's also an at VOG Network.
7867037	7869340	And right now all the rage is starter packs.
7870401	7872123	So there's a VOG Network starter pack.
7872143	7878651	And if you follow that, you're going to get this show, Bobby, DarkSakura, Loki, me.
7879951	7882192	Ranma, Anime Jam Session.
7882312	7884213	You're going to get all that stuff.
7884834	7886554	And some of you are in it.
7886935	7895378	Some of you that have been... Bobby put that together and pretty much if he recognized you as a serial commenter, you're in that pack too.
7895538	7896879	So check it out.
7897439	7897699	All right.
7899180	7899740	And we love you.
7899900	7901001	We love the serial commenters.
7901141	7901341	Okay.
7902953	7904514	I like cereal.
7905955	7909597	That's the Reddit I need to go post on is breakfast cereal, except it's a lot of carbs.
7909998	7916362	Okay, so here's... So again, because you oftentimes get actual interactions on...
7917438	7917999	BlueSky.
7918199	7920721	I made a kind of tongue-in-cheek post, okay?
7921121	7926005	So there's this trend on BlueSky called FCF.
7926606	7929989	I'm not going to tell you what it means, what it really means.
7930129	7936294	If you want to go to the darker parts of the internet and figure it out, have fun, but don't say I didn't warn you.
7936474	7937975	It's an X-rated thing, okay?
7937995	7938656	That's all I'm going to say.
7939176	7941738	But I made a tongue-in-cheek joke, and I posted it on our account.
7941798	7944281	I said, Happy Fat Cartridge Friday!
7945475	7947716	What is your favorite Neo Geo game?
7947796	7949337	Because Fat Cartridge Friday.
7949677	7952138	Let's take a look at what is your favorite Neo Geo game?
7952578	7954879	And I put mine is Fatal Fury Special, which is true.
7954959	7955999	Mine is Fatal Fury Special.
7956739	7960801	And apparently this got picked up by some Neo Geo fans.
7960901	7963402	And we actually got some pretty legit responses to this.
7963782	7964262	So you ready?
7964943	7967324	So Rin Mari out there.
7967584	7968224	Great to hear from you.
7968824	7969865	I see Rin in chat sometimes.
7970465	7971345	They said Strikers 1945+.
7973963	7974943	is a good one.
7975503	7977624	Yes, DarkSakura is here to rate your picks.
7979624	7981105	Yep, I'm here for it.
7981825	7983505	Deft says it's hard to choose.
7984005	7989006	You have a plethora of fighting games like Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.
7989046	7992607	There's also sports games like Super Sidekicks, Neo Turf Masters.
7992927	7995448	There's Meadow Slug, Magical Drop, Arrow Fighters.
7995868	7998068	So basically, Deft couldn't fucking pick one.
8000009	8000469	That's fine.
8000529	8000909	That's fine.
8002349	8009992	PodCulture said never had that system, to which I replied, well, didn't you ever see like a Neo Geo arcade cabinet at your local pizzeria or something?
8010252	8011633	And PodCulture said, nope, never.
8011833	8014194	So I, cause I never owned a Neo Geo.
8014214	8015455	Those things were fucking expensive.
8015475	8018316	I didn't have any friends with one either until like- I have one.
8018456	8044667	I know until like later in life that I met people that had a Neo Geo like years after the fact or I just didn't know them then um but most people I would assume played that four-in-one Neo Geo arcade machine at some point that's how that's how I played Bust a Move you know and all that stuff so that's a little pawn yeah that was my jam uh Magical Drop was another one that came to mind for me Metal Slug yeah um other comments oh this is a good one Dungeon Buster said
8046178	8049043	DungeonBuster said, I have a soft spot for crossed swords.
8050060	8050600	That was a good one.
8050680	8051261	Interesting.
8051281	8051801	That was a good one.
8052862	8058846	Gabriel Engard replied and said, Each one in the series is great, but I find myself returning to Art of Fighting a lot.
8059306	8066191	Giant scaling sprites, iconic sound design, great music, actually solid mechanics, possibly first desperation moves.
8066271	8067131	A real classic.
8067972	8069073	Art of Fighting was pretty badass.
8069093	8069513	That's a good call.
8069833	8074076	Art of Fighting, the way it did the zooms and all that stuff, and the characters were so fucking big.
8074236	8076177	It was a neat game.
8076277	8076838	I really liked it.
8078237	8089234	let's see FoxHack says Art of Fighting 2 I've been a real main for 30 years well and that gave us Yuri and her butt attack
8091360	8116438	DarkTetsuya says Special was definitely my favorite of the Final Fantasy Fatal Furies Also loved Arrow Fighters 2, Shock Troopers, Samurai Shodown 2, and Metal Slug 2 Samurai Shodown 2 was one who had Chom Chom and it had this little special move so you could turn them into chibis I played that in an arcade until they finally changed it out for 3 and I was very sad
8118563	8138899	Let's see, SGO100Matt says I always dumped a lot of quarters into any of the metal slugs, but King of the Monsters Super Baseball 2020 and Windjammers were always must plays whenever I came across them in the arcade Oh, that fucking King of Monsters game was on every goddamn Neo Geo cabinet I ever came across in my entire life I'm gonna throw one out right now What's that?
8139900	8146745	The Last Blade series Which I wish I owned a copy of Last Blade 2 for Neo Geo I just have the Dreamcast one
8148067	8153091	Deft with a very interesting cultural comment in chat saying, it's like choosing a favorite child.
8153131	8153532	You can't.
8153832	8160718	Besides, I'm Mexican, as in being literally in Mexico, where I know he listens to the show from.
8161239	8164041	I grew up on SNK and Neo Geo arcades.
8164362	8166383	Were those machines that prolific there?
8166684	8172229	I never realized that was a thing, but I guess if you're saying that, they must have been pretty prolific there.
8172589	8188103	there were relatively cost effective machines too because you could buy multiple cartridges and only have to own one machine then you would just switch out your cartridges ended up being a lot more cost effective than having to buy a new cabinet for every new thing that came out interesting point
8189804	8202084	and Deft confirms in chat, yeah PonyTouchogen in chat, sorry, on BlueSky I'm getting confused, this is why we don't introduce new segments to the show very often PonyTouchogen on BlueSky says Alpha Mission 2
8203328	8215195	and then we got a screenshot from HKT3030.bsky.social who says, I think probably Metal Slug for me down at the bottom in the shock box.
8215676	8228704	I've added Samurai Showdown to my collection since this photo was taken and we actually got a picture of a collection here that has a lot of classics in here including there's Windjammers, Garumaka the Wolves,
8229264	8238163	Street Hoop somebody's got a very impressive collection over there so DarkSakura I don't know if you can see the collection on Discord but would you rate this person's collection?
8239380	8241742	Hold on, let me see if I can take a look.
8241902	8243063	It's awfully small for me.
8243303	8244244	Oh, sorry, yeah.
8244944	8247326	So, Metal Slug, S tier.
8247426	8252130	Street Hoop, puzzle bobble, S tier.
8252610	8254612	Garou, Mark of the Wolves, S tier.
8256133	8258715	Golf, I don't like golf games, so D minus.
8259535	8263859	Windjammers, I'll give that a solid A. King of Fighters, 96, right?
8263899	8263859	98.
8263939	8265440	King of Fighters, 98. 98?
8268496	8269316	That's an interesting one.
8269356	8270397	I'll give that an A+.
8270857	8271117	Okay.
8271837	8274918	Super... I can't see.
8275078	8275998	Super Sidekicks 2.
8277759	8278699	Eh, not into it.
8278739	8283101	It gets a C. And then I guess that's Garou Densetsu 2?
8283381	8284241	Yes, the newcomers.
8285461	8288462	Yeah, that's an A tier.
8289183	8292304	And then Real Battle Fatal Fury?
8292544	8292744	Yep.
8294704	8295725	I'm gonna give that an A-.
8298845	8303069	I can't believe we just tier listed some guy's collection on our show.
8306091	8309855	He had a couple of... And I actually have some of those too.
8311156	8317442	It's actually a pretty decent collection because even the not-so-great Neo Geo games, they go for money now.
8318002	8321165	I think we've got Magician Lord...
8324852	8337792	baseball stars we have KOF 2000 we have Summer Showdown 1 and 2 and I can't think of what else we have I'd have to go look in the other room
8340526	8341907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8359858	8360658	Is that a golfing joke?
8360718	8360979	Maybe.
8361119	8361539	You decide.
8361599	8361859	All right.
8363460	8364961	Some people like different strokes.
8365261	8366001	Yeah.
8366041	8367242	With different folks.
8367402	8369823	We got another reply from iKamit.
8370263	8370583	I don't know.
8370663	8371844	I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.
8371884	8372384	Sorry, my friend.
8373145	8375646	It could be iKamit.
8375746	8385351	No, I think it's iKamit, who says, The Last Blade 2, something about the mix of King of Fighters-style movement and Samurai Showdown-style combos just vibes with me.
8387161	8390223	The little cinematics between it really make it for me too.
8391043	8392404	They're classy.
8392704	8393404	That's a good word for it.
8393424	8394145	They're classy.
8395986	8396226	All right.
8396246	8397146	Well, thanks for those responses.
8397166	8397766	That was fun.
8397846	8398547	Thanks, Blue Sky.
8399867	8403029	You get an S tier on your work on that assignment this week.
8403069	8403629	Thank you, folks.
8404410	8404830	You know what?
8404930	8408612	I need to make like a MIDI version of Mr. Blue Sky for us to play during that segment.
8410120	8437195	I like that, I like that I was going to say, you should turn tier list I'm giving you free ideas, Jamie, for your personal channel Take them Tier list my video game collection as a redeem Oh shit You know, I actually was It's so funny because I was trying to think of another I forgot what segment I said we were going to do as an extra next year for classics That I could do Um
8439033	8461411	I could do like viewer suggestion tier list like my top tens and so it's quick and easy but we'll see all right haven't decided well let's travel around and do some last minute stories I don't know if we have any of those Loki I don't think so I didn't see anything okay fair enough
8462076	8464237	Well, then that means we're at about the end of the show.
8488270	8513054	um so with that uh we're gonna wrap up and head on out for the night but we will be back in seven days to do it all over again uh we will still be doing the show through Thanksgiving holiday because Thanksgiving's on a Thursday and I don't think any of us are going on any big trips so we'll still be here um bringing you new shows so check it out well and and of course if you don't mind me mentioning Friday I'll be going all day
8513530	8513710	Yes.
8514310	8515131	Not this Friday, though.
8515171	8515651	Next Friday.
8515991	8516151	No.
8516951	8523253	I'm doing a Black Friday thing because why stay in line?
8523333	8526174	Why waste all of your money when you could waste it on other things?
8526634	8527494	What time are you starting?
8527574	8528515	Instead, watch me.
8528955	8529195	10 a.m.
8529215	8529515	this time.
8529855	8535678	Okay, so I will probably be there at the very beginning, and I can lurk for the day, but I am going to the Bay Area for Friendsgiving that day.
8536499	8537939	You need to at least play one game with me.
8538340	8544103	I will do one game with you, and just for you, DarkSakura, I will do Himbo Chris, just for you, if you want.
8545443	8545784	Yes.
8545944	8546264	Okay.
8546744	8547004	All right.
8547124	8547424	Okay.
8548265	8550186	Himbo Chris Redfield, just for DarkSakura.
8551044	8560646	And this is where I duck out, but I just want to let everybody know that you don't need a holiday to be thankful for the people in your life.
8563166	8567027	I think we're going to show thanks for those sorts of people a lot over the coming months.
8567287	8567887	That's for sure.
8568967	8569387	Thank you.
8569567	8572788	And when we say thank you all for listening and being here, we fucking mean it.
8573908	8575328	Thank you, DarkSakura, for being here as well.
8575588	8576328	And have a good stream.
8577529	8577909	Thank you.
8578009	8578609	Have a good evening.
8578629	8579009	You got it.
8579841	8582123	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
8582223	8583024	Your final thought tonight.
8584165	8586888	I have a very busy two weeks even though I'm off work.
8587248	8587689	Good for you.
8588049	8588810	I'm excited for you.
8589411	8598600	Do you think you're actually going to get to do creative or is it going to be, nope, you're off work, go clean the backyard or something, like do projects around the house?
8598860	8601483	No, thankfully we have people that do that kind of thing.
8601503	8601803	No, um...
8603244	8608567	No, I think I will try to get... I need to get that one build done.
8608587	8611548	So I'm going to try to work on that as much as I can.
8611668	8614330	I still wanted to get another episode out before that.
8614630	8617792	I was hoping to have that done this weekend, but the Redstone's taking too long.
8617812	8620253	You're just trying to figure out everything.
8620313	8630078	So now that I have it done, all of the assets are done, it's just going to be figuring out what the build's going to look like and maybe putting out an episode...
8631116	8658897	I don't want that to take too much time up though because like I said I only have two weeks to get this thing done and it's massive so we'll see alright well then my final thought is I was really upset because I recorded a great ColecoVision look back for my YouTube channel at Rob Roberts Plays but I had massive sound fail so I'm going to have to re-record it tonight and I hate to say it was a good one because I played the Smurfs Adventure on ColecoVision
8660037	8661538	Oh yeah, I still love that.
8661558	8662458	Oh, that fucking game.
8662938	8675424	So I'm going to re-record it tonight, but unfortunately it won't be quite as I'm actually debating maybe doing the Atari version instead because, I don't know, I'm kind of going back and forth in my mind right now because it's like, oh well shit, I already played the Coleco one now, it just didn't get recorded right.
8675844	8681406	But such is the lives and dreams of a YouTuber, sometimes you fuck up and it ruins the whole project, right Loki?
8683007	8683387	Mm-hmm.
8683638	8687281	Luckily, when we fuck up here on OLR, we just say, fuck it, we're putting it out anyway.
8688101	8690203	So we can edit that part out, right?
8690283	8692605	Except it's very rare we actually edit it out.
8692625	8694226	It has to be really bad to get it edited out.
8694646	8697828	But yeah, so we just do it live, I guess.
8698169	8700390	So we'll be back in seven days to do it live all over again.
8700710	8701951	Thank you all so much for being here.
8701971	8703132	I hope you have a wonderful week.
8703332	8704933	Enjoy, and we'll see you next time.
8705033	8705454	Bye, everybody.
8707655	8709917	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8712379	8712879	See you next week.
