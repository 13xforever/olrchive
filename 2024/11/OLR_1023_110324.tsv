10006	17590	Reading through the news, I couldn't help but grit my teeth at a statement by Satya Nadella stating that As we look ahead, our intellectual properties across our studios have never been stronger.
17750	19631	The context thanking Call of Duty chiefly.
19751	25873	Yes, Microsoft's portfolio has never been stronger as they keep the cod mines churning while shuttering studios that provide its sorely needed variety.
26094	28275	Businessmen excel at moving money around.
28615	29795	Out of the car and back in the saddle.
29975	35218	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this glib victory lap and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35438	37459	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39505	41705	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41725	46627	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46707	48787	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49127	57029	We're live once again with episode number 1023 of our show for today, November the 3rd of 2024.
59189	66431	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined here with you maybe an hour earlier, depending on where you're at, with the one and only DarkSakura, or J.B.
66451	66771	Summers.
67674	69394	Arizona, but honestly it should stay this way.
89494	90895	No, I totally feel the opposite.
90915	92076	I don't think Hawaii does either.
92236	92837	Oh, hi, Loki.
93437	94098	Oh, you're right.
94158	95359	I don't think Hawaii does.
95739	97961	They're always in a different time zone though because of where they're at.
98121	99162	And parts of Indiana?
100723	102764	Is there really parts of Indiana that don't change?
102844	104445	I didn't know that.
104465	105606	We should just stay like this.
105766	107526	It's nice for my vampire self.
107587	112229	Well, yeah, see, but for me, and I have moods that are affected by seasons.
112349	113309	I've talked about this before.
113610	117592	I do not like the less light at all.
117632	120773	I like to be able to go walk while it's still light out and get vitamin D that way.
120813	123354	But usually in this time of year, I just go at lunch.
124555	125676	I just have to hope it doesn't rain.
126576	127377	You know what?
127417	128517	I'm going to get you a light lamp.
128597	129638	It has done wonders for me.
129918	130338	Has it?
130358	130738	That's good.
130899	132920	I had one for a while.
132940	134200	I don't remember what happened to it, though.
134220	135181	I think it got left behind.
135241	138083	Also, my alarm clock has a wake-up light.
138363	138623	Oh, yeah?
139757	142859	and that actually has helped me quite a bit.
142899	143280	That's nice.
143340	147063	I have a cheapy alarm clock I've had forever, but I use my phone.
147483	149845	I feel like a lot of people just use their phones in this day and age.
149885	150465	I use my phone.
150505	151025	I use both.
151526	155088	And now my phone tracks my sleep because I have Pokemon sleep.
155108	156609	I don't feel like waking up to the sound of birds.
158071	160032	Well, I don't wake up to the sound of birds.
160092	164695	I have that normal like... Well, no, no, no.
164815	166797	Anyone with an iPhone knows the marimba.
167822	170246	My... My, uh, clock...
171417	173638	has bird noises and weird shit.
174438	175898	I just have it on for the light.
175938	177239	I only use it for the light.
177399	186001	My phone, I wake up to six different alarms, including excerpts from Super Metroid and Sonic the Hedgehog and a few other things.
187501	198264	Over in our chat room, over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, VOG Network on Twitch and vognetwork.com, nine o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
198824	201006	6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
201086	207232	And actually, PodCulture, who lives in Indiana, says they stopped doing that a few years back with the parts of Indiana that switched around.
207352	210655	So I guess it really is just Arizona and probably Hawaii.
210955	215759	We don't have anybody in Hawaii to confirm, but I think that is correct, that they don't flip the clocks either.
216200	217741	So how about that?
219366	223188	Anyway, but we don't just talk about clocks here on Orange Launch Radio.
223208	225569	We talk about what is going on in the gaming world.
225649	230471	So let's just jump into it and talk about a gaming-related app.
231611	236233	Loki, do you want to start us off tonight talking about a new app that Nintendo put out this week?
237358	240441	Yeah, Nintendo put out an app called Nintendo Music.
241081	243223	It allows you to listen to Nintendo Music.
243784	249448	You know, much like those other apps that have other music in them, but except this is just Nintendo.
250289	250890	And yeah.
252091	253792	Other features they have in there as well.
254273	257956	Some songs, obviously a lot of the 8-bit stuff that was in your games.
260026	260566	It's very short.
260946	262787	It's like a one minute loop or whatever.
263307	268609	It can be extended to 15, 30 or 60 minutes or just infinitely.
269109	270290	You can just loop it forever.
270710	275152	We call that replay or loop or something like that.
275172	275472	I don't know.
276792	283675	They have an initial wave of tracks from all different games in several different platforms.
284625	288547	So, of course, some of the more popular stuff, Animal Crossing New Horizons.
288927	291068	You've got the Wii with the Wii channels.
291088	293550	That's right, Mii Shop channel all day long.
293810	296131	We'll talk about that in a minute because I have a funny story about that.
297482	309027	Donkey Kong Country, Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Brothers, Splatoon, Star Fox, Nintendogs, Zelda, all the stuff.
309107	310308	But it's not everything.
310968	311868	It's not everything.
311888	318491	It's a limited selection and it's very obvious like the catalog of classic games.
318531	320832	They want to add to it every week for a little while until...
323273	345426	they are pulling what they do with the Nintendo Online stuff with the games and slowly drip feeding it out and of course much like the Nintendo Online stuff you have to have your Switch Online service and be paying for that in order to get access to this app on your mobile device um
348100	349401	Cool, I guess.
349841	351523	It's nice that they're having that there.
351623	356767	I just kind of wish that, you know, it would just be on any of the other apps that I use, you know.
357628	364674	I mean, some of it is because they illegally put it there, but it's fine, I guess.
367938	370779	It would be even cooler if it was incorporated into the Switch.
371639	372059	Yes.
372719	378480	So this is funny because I know nobody will remember this and I don't have the recording in front of me.
378940	384401	And I know y'all get sick of the Rob Stradamus thing, but I fucking said Nintendo should do this some time ago.
384521	392422	The only thing, I will say this, the only thing I got wrong is I don't think, I don't know, and I'd have to go back and find the clip and there are people much better at searching the archive than I am.
392462	397003	Maybe somebody can find this because I want to say we were talking about it when Nintendo was taking down all those YouTube channels.
397463	405973	And I was saying, you know, Nintendo ought to just take that part of Super Smash Brothers with the music player and have it on the Nintendo Switch with a Switch Online.
406233	409237	Because I was thinking, you know, people do hook up their headphones into the Switch.
409617	413441	So I didn't think â€“ I don't think in the moment I was thinking about cell phones.
413922	416024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
430254	432135	No, I mean, that's separate, I think.
432255	433956	I don't think that has anything to do with this.
434456	437978	But maybe they're putting this out to... I think it's yes and no.
438058	440379	Maybe the response to that made them decide to do this.
440580	441480	I think it's a little bit of both.
441520	444982	I think Nintendo has been planning this for a little while, which brings me to my other point.
445022	447003	Nintendo moves so fucking slow sometimes.
447403	450145	This app would have been so much better if it was like five years ago.
451105	468881	that's the biggest problem this should have rolled out with Nintendo Online or shortly after we should be talking about it now in 2024 when most people are asking the question where's Nintendo's next console and perhaps this is Nintendo's way to try to I think there's a lot of people this month
469241	497341	because you know they've around the time of this month is when people are re-upping their annual subs to Nintendo Switch Online so maybe this is just a play for people don't cancel it just yet y'all don't cancel this just yet because we've got all this you know music available in this player this is an added benefit of Nintendo Switch Online so you shouldn't cancel just yet I think ultimately that's a big part of it I mean while yes it is a thing I just don't see myself using this like honestly like
499830	510284	if I want to listen to Nintendo music I will just incorporate it into my playlist in Spotify like if I have to find a YouTube video how?
510324	511566	Nintendo music isn't on Spotify
512731	515975	Right, but you can play your own library that's on your device.
516175	523422	So if I find a way to download it, which is super easy, and just incorporate it that way.
523483	527767	But I'm not going to do that because it's too much of a hassle.
528448	531211	The value add is very minimal at this point, I think.
531271	531731	You know what?
531751	531952	Hmm.
534341	562703	I do it super easily on Apple Music because all I do is add it on my computer and it syncs to the cloud and I have my music well not with Apple Music I do it with crap, the other thing iTunes Connect I forgot what it's called it's an iTunes iTunes Match that's it, iTunes Match right, but like to the point though that it's not a big value add
564314	567437	There's a lot of music on YouTube that wasn't taken down.
567957	572241	So I find that if I want to listen to Nintendo music, it's still on YouTube.
572321	573942	Just maybe not some of the large channels.
574262	575844	Or it's people that altered it a little bit.
575864	582809	Like there's somebody that took a bunch of 8-bit songs and made them stereo, which is, you know, some people like that's sacrilege.
582849	584510	That's not what it was originally.
585872	586752	But I'm like, I don't care.
586792	587493	It sounds kind of neat.
588354	589975	So like there's a lot of those type of things.
590595	590695	Yeah.
591556	593539	But I mean, the Nintendo Music app is fine.
593720	595663	I don't I don't have an issue with it.
595743	598127	I think, you know, I said it's something Nintendo ought to do.
598527	599028	They did it.
599269	601853	And so it's hard for me to sit here and be like, why did they do it?
602594	606240	So here's the weird thing, though, like on top of all that, like it.
607581	612723	Talk about having no foresight into things.
613503	621546	You just released Alarmo, an alarm clock device, and yet this is not incorporated into that.
621566	622547	It's like...
624838	626080	What are you even doing?
626140	633089	Like, you have a device that's essentially a clock radio, and you're like, nah, nah, we're just not gonna do that.
633189	633930	I'll give you that.
634230	634931	I'll give you that.
635111	641760	It would be nice if the Alarmo connected with that so I could wake up every morning to the sounds of the escape music from the original Metroid.
642421	642501	Um...
643462	645523	My only complaint about it is that it's limited.
646004	649486	I like the repeat feature that's in there.
649546	650747	I think it's cute.
650847	657671	And Bobby brings up a good point, and I would agree with this, is that there's not an infinite replay.
657771	659652	It's only 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
660153	662074	Replay would have fade outs and fade ins.
662974	669297	That's, you know, if you were to do that based off like CD soundtracks, there was always a fade out and fade in because it was a loop forever.
669677	674860	So it helps to keep things a little more, you know, but any basic audio editing would get you that.
674920	676140	But again, it's the convenience, right?
676200	682063	It's convenience of having it all there and knowing that you're doing it the legitimate way or whatever you want to say about that.
682523	688427	Well, I know I get the warm fuzzies when I'm biting by Nintendo's corporate rules and all that stuff.
688947	693550	I know, it's just like, oh, we'd want to anchor corporate Nintendo.
693670	698893	Jeez, that would be awful if I could just have fun with their IP.
698993	700934	Just having fun on my own.
700974	702175	Not trying to profit off of it.
702555	704337	Just having fun with it without them...
705267	706869	Being so strict with the rules.
722285	749051	and they have the Famicom disc soundtrack for Metroid and of course as I'm sure many of you know there is a difference because the Famicom disc system specifically the disc system which Metroid and Kid Icarus and some other games were released on because that's why we had password versions and battery packs here because those were disc system translation games and that's how they got around the fact that the discs never came out in the US but that disc system had an extra sound chip and so some of the songs actually sounded different
749671	750652	Castlevania 3
767984	770506	Yes, but now that leads to the other big question.
770566	772627	So Castlevania III, Konami game, right?
772647	774888	So probably not going to be in the Nintendo Music app.
775689	776489	Or will it?
777050	786155	And I think that is an interesting question and to be determined is how will or will Nintendo third-party publishers be worked into this?
786495	791338	Because, you know, Konami, I think, has played pretty well with the Switch Online.
791359	791839	Well, actually...
792688	793148	Maybe not.
793188	794509	They've done some stuff.
794529	795530	There's a couple.
796070	800493	I feel like there was more on Virtual Console and we might have like Castlevania.
800553	802114	I don't know if we have.
802174	804435	No, because they did their separate collections.
804815	807937	I actually don't think we have anything Konami on Switch Online at this point.
808617	809238	It's because...
810752	836154	or it there might be a couple like Legend of the Mystical Ninja I think might be in there things that were like more one-offs here uh because I know Goemon is a much bigger series in Japan but I just can't help but think of how profitable this would be if they just sold these like like they did virtual console with you know you have the games you can buy the games and you can buy the soundtracks and you have it all in one library and then maybe that library is accessible on your mobile device as well like it would
838641	842024	It seems like that would be more valuable than what they're offering here.
842124	845087	But like, I mean, I can say I'm never going to use this.
845307	852994	Even though I pay for this, I pay for the extended, you know, whatever they call it, Switch Online Plus or whatever the hell it's called.
853074	853855	Like, it doesn't matter.
854055	857479	It just, you know, get some DLC for free type stuff.
859580	860882	Yeah, I'm just never going to use this.
861502	864025	And I mean, cool that they're doing this.
865322	865862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
889412	892373	Would third-party publishers maybe start lending some of their stuff?
892393	896415	Especially ones with legendary soundtracks, which are many of them.
896475	900096	Capcom, like shit, if the whole Mega Man library could be on there, that would be awesome.
900116	905038	But I think, again, most of that is on Spotify and iTunes and all the other stuff too.
905598	906779	So I'm curious...
907679	908379	Zero, so, you know...
933104	958520	It's not zero because Spotify, YouTube Music, iTunes It depends what the third party company has done For example, The Guardian Legend I would listen to that soundtrack every day There's no official way to do it That's a big fat nada because those publishing rights are kind of up in the air I think Compile might have actually released a soundtrack
958905	959587	Are you serious?
959848	960409	That's a big deal.
960429	961652	Hold on, I'm going to double check.
961773	963136	I remember seeing something about this.
963257	963658	Please do.
963878	965422	Guardit Gaiden soundtrack.
966463	994162	um so uh you would have uh that but then like you know I'm almost positive Konami has released a lot of soundtracks as has Capcom to things like Spotify and iTunes etc etc and you know I don't think they make oh my gosh a ton of money but they make a bit oh Square Enix is a great example says Fifth Dream uh Square Enix says uh they have a lot on Spotify I'm grateful so um
995506	996909	Why can't we just have one Nintendo online app?
1008194	1010895	Why can't they just add this into the existing Nintendo online app?
1010955	1012596	I get it's a different thing.
1013336	1018878	But shouldn't we have one target launch place for all things Nintendo?
1018958	1022439	Like that would just be, I feel like that would just be the better way to design an app.
1022539	1024280	But what do I know?
1024420	1026480	I'm just a schmo with a podcast, huh?
1027521	1030842	So anyway, let's see.
1031022	1033503	I was incorrect, by the way, but I got you.
1034500	1060016	well yeah no I know I know like it's easy to get the soundtrack rip it from YouTube or rip it from the game or whatever like I can do but like I'm saying there's no official way where somebody gets money because I am streaming the Guardian Legend soundtrack so that's I I would I would support that every day Guardian Legend for Nintendo music hashtag I'll keep on dreaming all right
1060987	1069730	Well, let's move on from Nintendo Music and talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week or music we've been jamming out to, I guess, whatever is the case.
1070070	1071330	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1073911	1075432	New and exciting, yeah.
1077052	1078232	No, it really was.
1080233	1089436	So I, of course, played Dead by Daylight now that it's working and I got a response back on my ticket and they gave me 100,000 blood points for my trouble.
1090590	1092332	Oh, that's cute.
1094174	1098137	Well, I say cute because did they give away like 300,000 blood points?
1099058	1102301	I've got all of that too, but this is an extra 100,000 and that was nice.
1102662	1103562	Sure, I guess it's something.
1103983	1104583	It's a gesture.
1105464	1105965	It's extra.
1106906	1108107	So, anyway...
1110460	1116323	Well, I mean, it was enough for me to get Dracula to P2, so hey.
1116824	1127189	Anyway, of course, I also played Polya, and then my game came out this past week that I have been waiting for for a decade.
1128905	1154731	Dragon Age The Veil Guard came out and you want to know what it's fucking great do not listen to the review bombers they're they're being assholes because they don't I don't know I don't care what they think it's great it's beautiful I am playing it of course to on Steam through the GeForce experience and it's it's beautiful I haven't had any problems with it um it's absolutely amazing I am really really really really happy with it
1155611	1158973	I'm just showing off my PlayStation 5 copy ready to go.
1159013	1162916	I haven't played it yet, but I'm hoping I finally will start tomorrow.
1164016	1170140	There are people who have been going off on it because of quote, wokeness, whatever.
1171761	1178145	Some of that comes from the fact that you can actually choose your gender identity as male, female, or non-binary.
1179205	1186687	doesn't quite encompass all of the selections out there, but this is far better than what we've seen before.
1188208	1195650	And then they also have your pronoun selection as he, him, she, her, and then they.
1196690	1204833	And again, going a little bit further than some other games have gone, you have... Sorry, I just don't...
1206113	1208074	These people, they get so mad about these.
1208374	1214957	To me, it's a lot like the gay marriage argument, is that people are like, people should not have the right to marry somebody of the same gender.
1215457	1222580	And the classic retort that I think still holds water is, if you don't like gay marriages, don't get one.
1223280	1248270	that's that's all yeah that's all you have to do if you don't want to get married to somebody of the same sex don't nobody is forcing you to and it's the same thing with pronouns and gender identity in games you it's it's very easy for you to not play somebody non-binary in this game if you don't want to wow what a concept my whole thing on that is I don't think bigots deserve any attention I would rather treat them like the relics they are and leave them in the past
1249497	1273952	unfortunately those bigots are getting headlines by review bombing which sucks we just don't have to give them any attention they do it for attention they do it to push something and if people just keep ignoring them keep voting against the things that they're standing for that's the problem that's why I don't want to stay silent because they're voting and clearly in large numbers which is scary they're all going to die
1276346	1278888	of natural causes, DarkSakura means.
1279668	1282090	No, here's what I mean by this.
1282130	1283851	Hyperbole, Twitch terms of service.
1285312	1286853	Okay, fine, hyperbole.
1287274	1288555	But it's the fact of life.
1288735	1291116	Everybody dies, end of story, no matter how.
1291757	1292758	And here is my thing.
1292798	1304506	If you look over the course of history, and yeah, we do have moments where there are setbacks, but things tend to move towards a more progressive state.
1306456	1309978	Do we have legal segregation anymore?
1312359	1313760	I said legal.
1315420	1317901	Can I go out and get a credit card, Rob?
1318902	1325605	If it was two years before I was born and I was an adult, I would not be able to get a credit card without Dan approving it.
1328666	1330707	What about everybody having voting rights?
1330887	1334689	The people who are voting against this shit...
1336309	1346535	As they die out, and the more progressive voices stay afloat, then, I mean, it's just a matter of progress.
1346955	1349317	The conservative is exactly what it is.
1349417	1356341	Conservative, and that usually ends up falling by the wayside as people learn new things about themselves and about society.
1357061	1363065	So, I just say that, and I feel comfort by it, and I'm...
1364523	1373107	Anyway, so to me, they're like having a roach infestation, right?
1376688	1379930	I just use my powers of extermination.
1380710	1383691	I vote, and my vote will exterminate one other vote.
1385792	1386693	And that's how I see it.
1386793	1388393	By the way, please vote on Tuesday, everybody.
1388613	1390014	Or now, if your state allows it.
1391334	1392455	Yeah.
1393716	1396458	Of course, we know common sense is so rare it's a superpower, right?
1397198	1397378	I know.
1397398	1398019	Thank you, Deadpool.
1398279	1399420	Anyway, back to Dragon Age.
1400781	1402602	So anyway, back to Dragon Age.
1406030	1410452	I found the combat to actually be pretty okay.
1410652	1414613	I do miss some of the targeting from Dragon Age Inquisition.
1414673	1428660	It made playing a mage a lot easier, but I really like how they've done kind of a different lock-on system.
1429160	1431221	It's not like a true lock-on, in my opinion.
1431881	1438145	But the battle mode and the regular running around mode are sort of integrated in that.
1438725	1439946	I'm just saying, I really enjoy it.
1440026	1441827	Character creation is still kind of wonky.
1442487	1443768	All of them are kind of wonky.
1443888	1449551	I actually had to go back and tweak my character at least once.
1452513	1457496	I'm enjoying that one of my favorite characters is Romanceable, and no, it's not Varric.
1459244	1467996	also, the game will start out by punching you in the gut of your heart that's all I'm going to say um
1469207	1493725	also the they have in like certain textures and things for uh injured characters um if it's part of a story point I think that's pretty cool but anyway I'm I'm loving it the voice acting is great I still want to punch Solas in the face and I think that the name of it should be changed to Dragon Age for fuck's sake Solas well originally the game was called Dragon Age Solas wasn't it the dread is called Dragon Age the Dread Wolf
1494659	1496740	No, but originally it was called... Like, in development.
1496760	1500021	It had, like, three other... No, I want to say the first first name was Dragon Age Solus.
1500081	1502182	It was the Dread Wolf, referring to Solus.
1502402	1502782	Oh, right.
1502842	1503403	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1503723	1507004	That was the title that it was going to come out with in one of the working titles.
1508805	1510165	Yeah.
1510685	1516408	I mean, Dragon Age the Dread Wolf sounds a lot cooler than Solus, and people who had never played were like, who the fuck is Solus?
1516528	1518028	But they'd play a Dread Wolf game.
1518088	1519509	Hell yeah.
1520910	1521350	Anyway...
1522561	1549621	moving on that has basically been replacing like my polya night and my retro night because I am into it and limiting myself to one night a week is slow and unfortunate torture which I may not limit myself I'm just saying I might do side quests and things because you know we can't have too many spoilers that's how I did 16 I said that's how I did 16 I played the main quest on stream and I did a side quest off stream
1551175	1554197	5th Dream says, I played all of them and I'm still like, who the fuck is Solas?
1554497	1556779	How can you not remember who Solas is?
1556999	1558800	I had that conversation with Nick last night.
1560021	1561421	Actually, like, legit question.
1561581	1563603	I didn't beat any of the prior Dragon Age games.
1563683	1564864	I'd like to play the Veil Guard.
1565004	1568486	I'm about ready to just play this thing and see what makes sense and what doesn't.
1568546	1570047	But like, is there a... Here's the thing.
1570087	1572908	When I ask people, how should I prepare for Veil Guard?
1572948	1576531	They say, well, you need to play Inquisition and you need to play... And I'm like, that's not realistic.
1576991	1578872	Okay, you need to watch this three-hour YouTube.
1578932	1579893	That's not realistic.
1579913	1580153	Okay.
1580853	1587097	Actually, whether or not you want something short and simple, everybody is right.
1587137	1592280	You really do need to go back and play through the previous game or at least watch highlights of it.
1593380	1597903	And definitely Trespasser is a big, big fucking huge part of it.
1598623	1600864	Yeah, I like the part where you said watch highlights.
1601205	1601725	That I can do.
1603004	1611170	Yeah, but I'm going to be perfectly honest that it's not a game that is an instant gratification kind of game.
1611250	1617115	It's one of those... The series has been an entire slow burn up to this point.
1617695	1617975	You know...
1619224	1620325	And that's the way I like it.
1620465	1633315	I like having to go back and understand a very rich lore behind the game and see where they put in the little tidbits that were like a blink and miss it moment from a previous game.
1634076	1639720	And, you know, I was writing fan fiction for Inquisition, so I had to know ins and outs of it.
1641001	1641801	But it was...
1644288	1658699	it really, really is a worthy game and I'm kind of to the point where these games where you know there are there are CliffsNotes versions and honestly enough Rob, if you want the CliffsNotes
1660074	1687863	I will, I'll be happy to spill the stuff for you but there are some YouTube that would do it in 10 minutes or less just keep going, again, I understand there will be things that are deeper in the lore that, like you said, wink and nods that will go over my head, that is fine I just want to make sure I understand the story like, okay, so this person's bad, this person's good this is what they're fighting for, just the key things that will just get me through the game
1690195	1693798	The whole series is not simple like that.
1693858	1694940	I'm just going to put it out there.
1695500	1698243	We've got three games worth of lead up to this.
1699204	1702707	And to me, this feels like it's the big push.
1702767	1704910	And it sounds like they're going to be doing another game after that.
1704950	1707732	They're saying that there's no going to be post-release DLC.
1707752	1708073	Mm-hmm.
1708996	1712018	Yeah, they're all on Mass Effect now, I believe.
1712999	1715401	Yeah, I'm sure that that's going.
1715521	1721525	But they've actually, from what I understand, already have a small team working on spitballing story elements.
1722706	1730132	But for me to sit and explain the points that would lead up to this...
1731491	1752252	would probably be at minimum 30 minutes for me to to go through those points and then I'd be like oh and by the way this happened that referred to this one I'm sorry I forgot to mention it blah blah blah um one thing too though is that you can do a really I'm just it's a spoiler but it's right at the beginning of the game so I'm just gonna say so um you can recreate your inquisitor
1752933	1781335	and I think mine mine looked a lot like my Inquisitor did so I think it might have pulled from something I don't know but you can pick who they romanced who is what you chose at key points of the game how you treated Solas so those were all points that I think are the big affectations in this one
1783934	1810772	but yeah I mean I would be happy to give you the the recap but it's gonna be pretty long still because there are I'm gonna so many other things I'm gonna tell you what it is I'm gonna play the game and if I understand it great if I don't I'm gonna say when I talk about it next week review it do not play this if you haven't played the other games it's not worth buying like and so I I hope that is not how this game leaves me feeling that's just like and that's I would say the same thing about a movie
1812128	1829283	you pretty much get thrust right into it now one thing I will say is that it's not necessary that you've read all the comics even though there are things from the comics that are in the game because the story has been very progressive the entire time like the whole uh
1831147	1833049	I don't want to say Apocrypha because it's not really.
1833109	1833810	It's all canon.
1834931	1837773	But it's pretty involved.
1837833	1841757	I don't really want to discourage anyone from saying it.
1842778	1843398	From playing it.
1843498	1844299	I really don't.
1844859	1852186	But I would suggest at the very least get familiar with what happened in Inquisition.
1853749	1854590	Just get familiar with it.
1854610	1858172	I can find a Wikipedia article or something.
1858372	1862515	Like I said, I'd be happy to tell you stuff.
1864296	1866497	At any rate, it's beautiful.
1866597	1867078	It's fun.
1869199	1873442	They have done quite a bit to where you can just get right into the game.
1874482	1874783	But...
1877645	1880647	But some of the races of people might not make sense.
1880908	1888133	They do refer to certain terms that do require a little bit more familiarity with the Dragon Age universe.
1888494	1897641	So have a glossary open and read the CliffsNotes of Inquisition, although it would still have been better had you played it.
1897941	1898241	The end.
1900503	1901484	Anything else for the game of the week?
1903073	1927505	some Baldur's Gate 3 which honestly I didn't play the other two Baldur's Gate games just saying but I know D&D so that's how I got into that you raised an excellent point though yeah, Varric does give you a little bit of a background on it so there is that there is that alright Varric is our storyteller well then we'll move over to Loki, how was your gaming week?
1929166	1952174	so this week I just played Minecraft really and edited video so I've got everything ready to go for my next episode which actually should be out tomorrow I'm pretty much done editing it so I did that and then of course Minecraft Adjacent I checked out that Oasis AI thing which is I don't know if you've seen it it's this
1953772	1981117	procedurally not even procedurally generated so completely like generated by AI Minecraft that you know plays about as well as you think it would in other words if you spin around it forgets what's behind you so uh it just it's all hallucination all the time but it has like some basic functionality in there where you can like place blocks and stuff granted as soon as you look away from those blocks it just hallucinates into something else but um
1982859	1983740	It's something.
1984260	1984780	I don't know.
1987082	1992546	This is not the next generation of gaming that we were hoping for.
1992626	1995668	It's just some AI experiment.
1998069	1999410	That's about it.
2000431	2001292	Well, my gaming week.
2001832	2003533	Way too much Diablo for us, always.
2003673	2007576	But I actually got to the point where I beat the season, which is kind of fun.
2008151	2009432	Well, yeah, yeah.
2009812	2014374	And let's not talk about you in Dead by Daylight, but yes.
2014394	2017056	Hey, we haven't had a call of that in a while, so I had to do it.
2017876	2022878	But yeah, no, Diablo 4 has been fun and got up to Torment 3.
2022999	2023579	I've cleared.
2024099	2025980	All the quests and the seasonal progression.
2026280	2030322	And I'm just about to tier 90, which is good because I do have some other games I want to play.
2030682	2036184	And once I kind of finish out the Battle Pass, I'll be like, okay, I can put Diablo on hold until the next season starts in mid-January.
2036545	2041767	Plus, I think there's a patch for Final Fantasy XIV coming out very soon, which will probably get me back on that bullshit.
2042047	2046269	And of course, I do have things like Dragon Age and other games I want to catch up on.
2046309	2050431	So, you know, too many games, not enough time, as tends to be the case.
2050871	2051691	Thank you for watching!
2071897	2079462	Uh, otherwise, uh, I hope Tigerclaw's out there because I'm going to mention that I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge last night.
2080282	2087766	Uh, I was hanging out with one of my friends and we were like, hey, what can we play that's like, you know, on Game Pass or something that's not going to be like expensive to buy?
2088026	2089567	And I was like, oh, let's play the Ninja Turtles game.
2089587	2090067	That'll be fun.
2090107	2091328	So we played through quite a bit of that.
2091908	2092669	Uh, and that was a lot.
2092709	2093709	That was, yeah, that was fun.
2093729	2094610	I played as Leonardo.
2094690	2095010	Thank you.
2095050	2096791	Just like I always did in the arcade machine.
2097552	2099573	Uh, and honestly, it just, it just...
2100353	2102855	It just felt like we were playing the 90s arcade game.
2103075	2104616	It really did.
2104696	2117304	There's obviously collectibles and things that are different, but for the most part, you know the fucking Shredder's Revenge if you've ever played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at an arcade or a pizza parlor at some point in your life.
2118204	2124868	But it's fun, and if you have Game Pass, you should try it out, especially if you're in the situation I'm in where it's like, we need to play a multiplayer game.
2124928	2125709	Quick, let's do it.
2126829	2127590	So that's that.
2128431	2134837	Otherwise, I have been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, but that is about it for my gaming week.
2134937	2139361	Oh, I should mention this, though, at some point, since I brought up the Nintendo Music app earlier in the show.
2140162	2141062	This is kind of silly.
2141623	2143585	I had my first TikTok.
2144125	2144466	Oh, hold on.
2144486	2145447	I'm getting coffee delivered.
2145487	2146147	Thank you, Alan.
2146428	2146828	You're nice.
2146968	2147569	I appreciate that.
2147629	2148449	Thank you, Alan.
2148469	2149110	Where's mine?
2149530	2150892	Jamie wants to know where her coffee is.
2154757	2155758	He said the supermarket.
2156058	2156318	Anyway.
2160220	2161941	Okay, so the Nintendo Music app.
2162001	2170486	So I made a TikTok the day that Nintendo Music app came out because, you know, the Wii Shop music is in it, which is, you know, it's a banger.
2170626	2171426	It's a good suit.
2171466	2181732	And I pasted this TikTok where I'm just staring off into space and that song is playing in the background and it says, I'm so glad the Nintendo Music app is that now I have music to disassociate properly to or something along those lines.
2182768	2184449	That TikTok is up to 80,000 views.
2184769	2193175	It's the first thing I've ever had that went like in 20 fucking years that has gone like truly viral, which I think is really funny and random.
2193215	2199680	So it just goes to show you never know what's going to be the thing that catches a lot of eyes.
2199760	2200941	But that's it.
2201461	2203582	But don't get it twisted.
2204043	2207865	I am not suddenly monetized on TikTok or some sort of TikTok celebrity.
2207946	2208126	Nope.
2208686	2209086	and DarkSakura.
2223894	2225735	Anyway, let's see.
2226536	2234181	Over our Twitch chat, over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, TigerClaw asked if I did the new DLC.
2234561	2238003	No, but I could see that they were in there with Mona Lisa.
2238044	2244788	Yeah, no, he didn't buy the DLC because the whole point was, let's play something we already have or is part of our subscription.
2244848	2247050	So he didn't pay for the DLC because we were at his house.
2247450	2249491	So that was the whole thing.
2250852	2251312	But it was fun.
2251332	2251973	We had fun playing the game.
2253001	2254683	Okay, that's it for my gaming week.
2254723	2258066	Let's move on and get into some gaming news.
2258427	2264473	And Loki with some news I think we all kind of expected, but it's disappointing all the same.
2265374	2265795	Get into it.
2267048	2285304	yep so uh Fire Rock Studios is shutting down this is what happens when Sony buys you I guess uh so they the team responsible for the game Concord which did not do well and they pulled it off the marketplace and we had hoped oh maybe they're retooling it for like a free to play nope nope
2286218	2287778	Not happening at all.
2289099	2296480	So, you know, they said certain aspects of Concord were exceptional but others did not land with enough players and as a result we took the game offline.
2296900	2307603	We spent a considerable amount of time these past few months exploring all of our options and after much thought we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.
2307903	2312044	I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit, and dedication.
2312793	2342445	and that's not enough to keep your studio around I guess I mean I would really love to see like kind of a behind the scenes development of this like how this came about like is it feels like if this is like bad corporate decision all over it and then of course the devs get to pay for it it's the wrong people paying the price for the bad decisions once again in gaming are we surprised
2345280	2368306	So, I'm not going to say who, but somebody I know who worked in the gaming industry, I say worked because unfortunately this individual was laid off relatively recently, posted a very funny video on his Facebook, it wasn't like actually funny, it was like a parody thing that was like mimicking the boardroom at a gaming company that was talking about all these like, you know, let's, it's obviously all these shitty things that companies have done over the years.
2368946	2374070	Let's make the battle pass half as long, and then that way we can get twice as much money out of it.
2374130	2375411	It's all these things.
2375491	2379854	And then there's the one guy that's sitting there going, what about games just fucking being fun?
2380795	2383797	And they're all looking at him like he's wacky.
2383977	2394344	Even though, as funny because it's true as that whole thing was, I look at that guy and go, oh, by him, he's Baldur's Gate 3.
2395305	2397085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2420251	2428194	It probably was made for some sort of live service element that they threw out the window and kind of thought, how can we salvage this sort of thing?
2429215	2430435	I didn't get that impression of them.
2430776	2431256	Interesting.
2431736	2436898	But well, what we can say is that Dragon Age doesn't have it in there.
2437198	2448083	Whether it was once planned to be in there or not, it's not there, which is a promising sort of viewpoint that maybe the person who is saying, do we have to nickel and dime every damn thing?
2448443	2453008	or can paying $70 for the game just be enough and we sell lots based on that fact.
2454790	2456752	So there's that whole thing.
2456832	2465861	But Bobby said it very succinctly on his show before us tonight and I would tend to agree that the bubble on the live service game has burst.
2467937	2472380	as tends to be the case with all of the trends that gaming companies chase.
2473140	2483207	MMOs, remember when so many companies were putting out MMOs because everybody thought they had the next Warcraft and some of them got a hell of a lot closer than others.
2484147	2488170	Some of them like, of course, I can't even remember their names now.
2489091	2492653	There was Warhammer game that did all right.
2493093	2496836	There was the, oh, I can't remember the name of that MMO.
2497455	2498556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2515183	2517705	It really searched during the pandemic.
2518946	2523829	VobiKurt and Phil of Nine is VO by Kurt, but I affectionately say VobiKurt.
2524109	2524790	And hello to you both.
2524990	2527912	VobiKurt says Guild Wars was okay and Phil of Nine says Guild Wars too.
2528252	2532615	The reason why I'm excluding Guild Wars from the MMO considering y'all aren't wrong.
2533235	2560815	but neither of those games had the monthly fee and I think that's the thing that kind of but I guess to be fair there were a lot of free to play MMOs that came out in that period too and they all flopped because the market was just flooded with them and none of them really were able to stand out in that same sort of way the only one that really was Final Fantasy 14 feels like the only one that was able to get an 11 I guess that's able to charge a monthly fee and EverQuest is still kicking to be fair so
2561716	2566521	And there's a couple others out there, but none nearly with that same success as World of Warcraft.
2566901	2578392	And then I feel like there's a lot of games, you know, and maybe to a lesser predatory feeling extent, there is a hell of a lot of Minecraft clones for a hot minute.
2578612	2579353	Wouldn't you agree, Loki?
2579373	2580534	Like, we're still seeing some of those.
2580874	2582035	I mean, that's still a thing.
2582055	2584918	Like, Minecraft clones are kind of a thing.
2584938	2586359	Whatever Nintendo's doing.
2586379	2586460	Yeah.
2587140	2614724	yes yes very much to that whatever Nintendo uh remember uh 3D.GameHeroes which was like literally Zelda that was yeah I was gonna say that's not so much Minecraft that's more just uh voxels are popular and then they made them a Zelda game is essentially it's it's legally distinct Zelda game um which I still think that game's great I wish that was ported to PC uh because I don't want to play it on the PlayStation 3 yeah
2616764	2625173	Anyway, but now my point is the live service game, everybody's trying to do one and there's only so much space.
2625213	2635423	Like just everybody thinks, oh, we can just copy paste the model, make cool characters and kids are going to eat them up because they're cool because they got big guns and they float around and it's pretty and the maps have
2635763	2665103	Lens Flares and 4K and 8K and lighting effects and blah blah blah and dumb kids are going to eat it up and give us all their money and Battle Pass and we're going to have really cool cosmetics that are just palette swaps of things it's like no, the bubble has burst on that my friends, it is very hard now to have a game that can have a sustainable Battle Pass Diablo 4 has one but I would bet very few people use the Battle Pass in Diablo, very few of course, Dead by Daylight is one that is successful but
2665723	2669604	Dead by Daylight's kind of, you know, again, is sort of an anomaly.
2669684	2676445	And we've seen how many 4v1 games kind of come and go or kind of are treading water.
2676465	2682346	Like, I know Texas Chainsaw Massacre is still a thing because Alan still really likes that game, but I feel like that game's treading water.
2682426	2684666	Like, it's not really a big thing.
2684686	2685887	I hardly see anyone playing it.
2685927	2687767	Yeah, yeah.
2687907	2693348	And then, of course, there was Killer Clowns, which got Elvira, which is cool, but I can't say I've seen many Twitch people doing that.
2694548	2713519	and you know but you know it's just I feel like it's just always kind of chasing what came before it and when it comes to live service games and a lot of money Concord was chasing it and the money just wasn't there the demand wasn't there for something like that it's just it's like yeah it once again with any of those things that are trying to
2715202	2743821	be like something else you have to make yourself distinct enough to like why are people going to want to choose you over what is essentially the you know thing that you're copying you know in some games like for example like there's Hytale which is I don't think ever going to come out but it's essentially Hypixel which was a Minecraft server they're trying to spin it off into their own game that is
2744461	2773295	like Minecraft but not but is um so it's just it's like not but is it is I mean it's pretty close uh yes but no but yes yes but no but yes but no but no uh but yeah you have to like what's gonna bring them to that game and then fortunately with Concord it was like it wasn't really anything it's like yeah we're doing what this game's doing and this one's doing and this one's doing but we have a storyline that's weekly it's like
2774924	2777985	Eh, Cap, I don't care about your characters.
2778485	2779906	I don't know who your characters are.
2780086	2781126	Why do I want to watch it?
2781887	2789530	That would be like, you know, imagine Marvel comes out with a brand new TV show featuring brand new heroes you have never heard of.
2791090	2791850	They're not in comics.
2791890	2792571	They're not in anything.
2792591	2793351	It's just a TV show.
2793591	2795272	We're going to sign it on for four seasons.
2795752	2798073	And you're like, I don't know if I want to watch that.
2798153	2800514	I don't really know who these are yet.
2800574	2800914	I mean...
2802938	2830504	I'm thinking like literally my entire timeline on Blue Sky is so gay for Agatha all along and I understand she's in the comics but I feel like it's a lot of it's not Agatha they are going crazy for Agatha and Aubrey Plaza but it's fucking Patti LuPone the fucking queen of theater and cinema in that show in particular and I don't know if she played a character that was from the comics or I don't know enough about Marvel but I just know that
2831164	2833547	That people are losing their fucking mind over that show.
2833607	2837792	And I understand, like, it's apparently, like, it's literally for the girls' gays and bays.
2838453	2840856	And even straight guys will appreciate it, you know?
2840976	2843639	Like, it's a pretty good show, from my understanding.
2844180	2847283	So... Yeah, basically, it's like you're...
2849950	2859100	it's like it sounds like a lot of those like Kickstarters you know the pitches for a game where they're like yeah we're gonna I mean Mighty No.
2859120	2869131	9 perfect example yeah we're gonna have this game come out but then we're also due to the comic book and an animated series and a movie and a this and we're gonna have plushies and it's like
2870365	2872705	Yeah, but like, is the game going to be good, though?
2872986	2877486	Like, because I don't want to watch it and consume any of this other stuff if the game's not going to be good.
2878087	2884908	And the game was all right, but it wasn't offering anything that the other services weren't.
2885208	2894570	And on top of that, they wanted, you know, a $40 mission fee to this, which is, you know, you got to really deliver then if you're asking for money up front.
2894710	2894870	Yeah.
2895370	2899232	Alright, let me get to some chat comments, because there's some good stuff here in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
2899752	2906136	VobiKurt says, it's a bit different, but casual game battle pass and premium pass type things still rake in some decent money.
2906536	2913459	Good point, because a lot of like free games, especially like Pokemon type of things, you know, you see a lot of battle passes and those that do well.
2913860	2919122	Again, I think a lot of those games, especially when you say casual, they start as free, so it feels a little easier.
2919422	2923965	And you know, even something like Dead by Daylight, I would argue they practically give away for free.
2924585	2946145	several times a year so you know that I but I think that's part of the reason for that game's particular success is they money's in the DLC yeah they made it pretty easy to get on board I love this comment from the break man and I don't know how much you're gonna hear that sentence on the show just kidding friend but you got I I this comment is on point this is a this is a gold star comment from of all people the break man you ready
2947106	2949969	It's like OnlyFans... Oh, I'm not supposed to say that word on Twitch.
2950329	2952651	It's like OF, the website.
2953252	2957116	If you aren't famous already, you are more than likely wasting your time.
2958877	2959258	That is...
2960745	2964387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2983439	2984600	Let me use it in another sentence.
2984940	2989643	CharlieXCX makes music for Girls, Gays, and Thays.
2990063	2992504	But it doesn't mean that other people are excluded from the party.
2992544	2996387	It just means like, oh, this one really feels relatable to the Girls, Gays, and Thays.
2997487	2999088	DarkSakura, you know what I'm talking about, right?
2999609	3000089	Yeah, I know.
3002390	3003311	I totally know.
3003511	3005732	Is there a video game for the Girls, Gays, and Thays?
3005912	3006633	Oh, Dead by Daylight.
3006653	3006773	Okay.
3007759	3009400	Oh, yeah.
3009820	3010740	Right in front of my salad.
3010780	3011140	There it is.
3011640	3011940	All right.
3012801	3022844	Anyway, let's move on and talk about Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, making songs for girls, gays, and Beyonce.
3024385	3025465	Well, that's Dolly Parton.
3032159	3032519	All right.
3034240	3034700	Let's see.
3034760	3035301	Moving on.
3035361	3039222	Let's talk about... Oh, this beta came out this weekend.
3039263	3040203	I actually checked it out.
3040243	3041664	It's Monster Hunter Wilds.
3042004	3044705	I've kind of cooled down on the mobile phone game lately.
3044745	3048947	I still enjoy... I'm playing too much other shit on mobile phone, like between Ingress and Pokemon.
3048967	3051128	Yeah, I play a lot of mobile phone shit, right?
3051608	3060353	Oh, I didn't even talk about the Pokemon trading card game I downloaded and got into this week, which is not a literal translation of the actual trading card game.
3060973	3061913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3081218	3084740	But because I do enjoy Monster Hunter now on mobile, I was like, you know what?
3084780	3086662	I want to try getting into a Monster Hunter game again.
3087062	3096148	And then I heard that Monster Hunter Wilds got an open beta on PlayStation 5 or like a test run or something, which I think was only running for a few days.
3096368	3100451	I don't think, yeah, it was only run through October 31st.
3101091	3105974	The open beta for other platforms like Steam started the other day and ends tomorrow.
3106054	3109537	So if you haven't checked this out, like on Steam or something, you don't have a lot of time left.
3109997	3110497	DirtyPillows DirtyPillows
3138280	3140102	I can see your dirty pillows.
3140122	3141062	Their breasts, mama.
3141743	3149369	Anyway, but these dirty pillows, or whatever you want to call them, are what you end up fighting in the game instead of the spiders, which is cool.
3149849	3153212	I don't have arachnophobia to that extent.
3153232	3161439	I don't like spiders a lot, but I don't have it to this extreme where I can't have them in a game, so it's hard for me to say how it makes me feel because I can't relate to...
3162139	3163962	Like completely shutting down because of it.
3164002	3165464	But I know that's a thing for some people.
3165584	3167347	So I think that's cool.
3167507	3170692	I'm always about more people being able to play the games.
3170892	3171052	So...
3172133	3173434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3197492	3198213	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3214155	3217337	Anyway, very cool to see that type of accessibility feature and other stuff too.
3217377	3219338	There was color blindness features in there too.
3220499	3221780	I thought really smart.
3222300	3226463	Text, you can change the text size and it says, are you going to be playing this game?
3226503	3230886	Do you want text size for a monitor or do you want text size for a television?
3231267	3238992	And I thought that was really smart because they're basically saying, do you want it like you're sitting right in front of the screen playing it or like you're sitting in your living room playing it on the TV and you need the text bigger?
3239292	3240073	Smart, smart, smart.
3240374	3243738	So I like that developers are really thinking about all these things in their games.
3243918	3250667	I can't believe I'm a little hyped for a Monster Hunter game finally for the first time in my life, but I think I am a little bit.
3250727	3254191	I kind of want to check this out, depending on what else is going on at the time.
3256494	3267905	Alright, and SHO100Map talking about the Pokemon Trading Card Game saying, post your Pokemon Trading Card Game friend codes in the VOG Discord, folks, in the Let's Game Together section.
3268365	3268945	I will do that.
3269046	3270547	I will put my code there for y'all.
3270807	3274230	Just please, if you're going to add me, send me a message with your name because...
3275091	3301051	the unfortunate thing about the trading card game is that if you do a wonder trade or whatever they call it with somebody random online there's an option right there to add somebody as a friend and those like I'm not trying to be a jerk but I really just want my friends list to be people I actually at least know a little bit or at least I know like oh that's a no LR person or that's a you know blue sky person or you know whatever it is like just just tell me who you are and it's I'll add you it's no big deal so I'll put my code in there um after the show tonight
3302096	3303317	Okay, let's move on.
3303357	3304978	DarkSakura, I love this story.
3306419	3308861	Yeah, we knew it was inevitable, didn't we?
3312164	3315066	You know, we joke about running Linux on things.
3315146	3318088	The other joke is about Doom running on things.
3318608	3321190	And someone has put Doom...
3322342	3324865	On the Nintendo Sound Clock Alarmo.
3325505	3330350	Yeah, it is a playable version of Doom.
3331591	3336716	You load the level, you walk around, you use the right side button to fire at enemies.
3339779	3343582	But it was done by a programmer named Gary Otternich.
3345004	3348286	The German for night, I guess.
3349587	3358414	And it's really, since it's only like 2.39 megabytes, it's not really hard to make it run on a lot of things.
3361056	3365259	Actually, reading this got me on a deep dive of other things that Doom has run on.
3367501	3371923	and I have a list, a small list, if you want to know some of them.
3371943	3373063	Well, what are some of the highlights?
3373083	3377125	Because I imagine that list has got to be like hundreds of things long, but what are some of the highlights?
3378486	3379827	It runs within Outer Wilds.
3379987	3394794	It runs on an iPod Classic and an iPod Mini, an Amazon Fire TV stick, a Samsung dishwasher, a Porsche 911, a parking kiosk, on a digital camera, on a pregnancy test,
3396474	3402239	on a MacBook Pro Touch Bar, Treadmill, a Ticket Validator on a vape.
3403399	3404160	It's run on a vape.
3406242	3409044	The best one to me is the pregnancy test.
3409364	3414047	A thermostat on a Sony Ericsson K800i.
3414067	3417690	The pregnancy test is so wild to me.
3417750	3418170	I love it.
3418971	3421193	They've got it running on an Apple Watch on a chainsaw.
3423129	3428470	It's a chainsaw that's got like a digital settings thing on it on an S Classic.
3429690	3432131	Someone got it into Sonic Mania.
3434411	3435811	To play on one of the little bonus TVs.
3435831	3438032	Have they got Doom running inside Doom?
3439412	3441973	Oh, I'm pretty sure that's... I think that's already a thing.
3442633	3444373	They've got it running in Morrowind as well.
3445313	3449494	But my favorite is the pregnancy test because it's really just like very...
3451076	3454621	Tiny, black and white, you know, complete monochrome.
3455502	3457385	And it's absolutely hilarious.
3457685	3461250	And I like what Fifth Dream says, pregnancy test, you are doomed.
3463349	3467792	Okay, so it's just the display, so you can't actually play it on the pregnancy test.
3468232	3468593	Still.
3468973	3469233	Still.
3469694	3473337	But the Alarmo is actually running Doom for real.
3473417	3474137	And here's the thing.
3474297	3477000	It's not that it has to make practical sense, y'all.
3477380	3481443	It's just that it has to be something where you can say, I did it.
3481923	3483685	I got Doom on the pregnancy test.
3483785	3484265	I did it.
3485126	3491171	So what's our top three things that we would love to see Doom running on that isn't currently running on
3491889	3495691	For the record, Rob, I have found Doom running within Doom.
3496772	3497653	Of course, of course.
3497973	3500174	In the DOS version of Doom, so there you go.
3500595	3504737	Top three things that we want to see Doom running on that it isn't already running on yet?
3505758	3506799	That should have been the listless.
3508279	3511922	The PDF version of Trump's jail sentence.
3513043	3513363	Hmm.
3515399	3517522	I'm gonna say one that's a little bit more serious.
3518323	3520425	The Vegas Sphere.
3521126	3522387	Oh, The Sphere in Vegas.
3523228	3524229	Yeah, The Vegas Sphere.
3524249	3525111	Okay, that's a good one.
3525891	3530397	Apparently Doom has already been running on an ATM so we can cross that off of the list.
3530637	3532599	That's too fast.
3532960	3533040	Um...
3535672	3537692	I'm sure it's been on an arcade one.
3537772	3540633	Oh yeah, that's the thing.
3540673	3543193	I'm like, Doom probably already runs on most of these things.
3543233	3546034	I'm just not well aware of everything that Doom runs on.
3546054	3546854	Oh, Half-Life 3, funny.
3547714	3549935	Oh hey, that's a good way to get Half-Life 3.
3550855	3557476	I wonder if Doom could run on my PC cooler because it has a screen on it.
3558776	3559536	This is USB.
3560236	3561417	How about an Etch-A-Sketch?
3562557	3563457	An Etch-A-Sketch?
3564215	3590928	so people have got it running on there's a whole reddit discussion on someone's got it running on SimBoss so Amstrad CPC Sinclair, they've got them running I've got it, Doom running on my neighbor's Christmas lights oh that would be amazing that would be probably possible Commodore VIC-20 of course
3594108	3617032	um all right all right well can they get Doom running in this next game I'm sure somebody's already trying it but Loki this is a game we don't really talk about very often on OLR but I know you you know it's it's a game that is important it's been a while it's been a while I haven't so I haven't played Black Ops since Black Ops 2 tell us what's going on with Call of Duty I can't believe I just said those words aloud but what's going on with Call of Duty
3617930	3621775	Call of Duty is coming in clutch for slow news weeks.
3622416	3626361	No, but they just launched Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and apparently it's doing well.
3626941	3628143	Why is it doing well?
3628603	3633109	I know this is going to be such a shocker, but it's because it's on Game Pass.
3633950	3634831	Wow!
3635919	3636639	Look at that!
3636799	3641860	So it's reached, um, they've had the biggest Call of Duty 3D opening weekend ever.
3642320	3650141	So, uh, the most players, most hours played, and most total matches.
3650642	3653842	So they're number one across the board, I guess, for that stuff.
3654402	3665224	Which, I mean, yeah, that's what happens when you give the game away, not for free, but with, you know, a service that doesn't cost much each month, and so, like, I could play it if I wanted to, and
3666022	3669024	I don't, because... I don't know.
3669744	3670124	I should.
3670144	3671905	I used to like the campaigns.
3673046	3673626	Online, no.
3673886	3674327	No thanks.
3675747	3678969	Lesson played with my friends, but... Yeah.
3679349	3679670	I don't know.
3680170	3682191	It's good that it's doing well.
3682351	3685853	I mean, I guess that sort of kind of justifies the spending billions of dollars.
3685873	3689335	Seeing it's one of the biggest investments Microsoft's ever made, it's good to see it's doing well, yeah.
3689355	3689555	Yeah.
3690618	3692881	Yeah, so $69 billion.
3695023	3701630	I'm sure it's doing so well that you're not going to have to lay off more people at the end of the year, right?
3702731	3703031	Right?
3703772	3704093	Right?
3705274	3705834	The silence?
3706495	3707016	Not hearing it?
3710612	3711252	Yeah, Psy.
3711572	3711752	Yeah.
3712432	3712732	All right.
3713132	3718453	Well, speaking of Psy's, get ready to let out a big one because I, this doesn't compute.
3718553	3719354	It doesn't make sense.
3720074	3722214	I'm not surprised, but it doesn't make sense.
3722354	3722774	Oh, sorry.
3722834	3726335	To circle back to Doom running in Black Ops.
3726715	3726815	Oh.
3727735	3732696	No, but Wolfenstein, I think, was in Black, or no, was that Pitfall?
3732916	3733436	One of those.
3733976	3734576	Pitfall, I think.
3734596	3736937	I think Pitfall, being an old school Activision game, was.
3737297	3737537	Yeah.
3738057	3738217	Yeah.
3738237	3738357	Okay.
3738517	3738717	Okay.
3739636	3739876	All right.
3740376	3743839	Well, back to what I was saying about this is annoying.
3744019	3748561	It's about the PlayStation 5 and talking about accessories like the plates.
3749202	3754605	So plates that you buy for the PlayStation 5 Slim, they don't work with the PlayStation 5 Pro.
3755225	3758727	And while you might go, well, I guess that makes sense because they're different sizes, right?
3759248	3760909	No, they're not different sizes.
3761109	3762530	They are the same size.
3763757	3764518	3D printing you back.
3787901	3789442	I wonder if that might be possible, actually.
3790222	3794744	They didn't share an image of the PlayStation 5 Pro itself because that is not out until later this week.
3795144	3799386	But, you know, they're already out there in the wild and this obviously made its way to Reddit.
3799886	3806289	So they have different interlocking teeth to make them not compatible even though they are the same.
3808350	3811591	It just seems unnecessary.
3811711	3812692	It just seems like...
3814637	3836091	Losing, like, intentionally not having value for the sake of not having value and making you buy more Although, I don't know how many people out there would have both a slim and a pro But I guess it's possible, it's possible Well, it's not even necessarily that, like, what if you heard, you know, it's like, oh, these are the same size, I'm just gonna buy one anyways Mm-hmm
3836751	3857984	and and you buy it or like hey you had a PlayStation Slim and you sold it yeah and you get a pro and you have these face plates that fit and it's like oh no haha you gotta buy more like well you don't have to but it's annoying right it didn't work but if you wanted to look the way you want to look like I would just
3859189	3859669	Just don't.
3859829	3860909	Just don't buy more.
3861089	3865630	Like, just take the L and just realize that this is what Sony's gonna do.
3866230	3867511	And don't buy the plates.
3867631	3868251	That's my plan.
3868431	3872151	LBSTL files out before too long anyway, so it's not gonna be a thing.
3872171	3873272	I'm sure there are.
3873352	3875232	It's just, it's spiteful just to do this.
3875692	3876672	Like, what's the point?
3876912	3882873	Oh, well, I'm sure they'll make some excuse like, well, it's just, you know, to make them stay on better or something like that.
3882893	3883073	No, it's...
3887452	3889033	That's something that should have come up a long time.
3889413	3898320	Maybe if you had designed with some semblance of backwards compatibility with the other consoles in mind, and I know it's weird to talk about backwards compatibility in the same generation, but I am.
3898720	3901642	But that just tells me I'm not buying faceplates for PlayStation.
3902023	3902523	Why should I?
3904464	3905885	So thank you for the PSA, Reddit.
3905945	3906526	I appreciate it.
3907079	3935259	well here's another let's put our tinfoil hats on now so here's another one so you know how they've been making faceplates and stuff for Sony is the only one to be able to make faceplates for their system they will not license it out and they will sue other people that will do that that said dbrand said fuck you guys we're going to do it anyways and they did so now these won't work with that system
3936668	3939569	DarkSakura, what's going on in Nintendo's world?
3961255	3968185	Well, there was a big switch error that was preventing people from making purchases in the eShop.
3970188	3975897	And it looks like it was really getting in the way of people being able to...
3976938	3996786	you use the holiday sales so Nintendo said that they've got it resolved all the servers are functioning normally and they've got it addressed this was actually starting though on the 31st when people were trying to make those purchases it was an error code 2813-5304
4002208	4011037	and it's the type of error that shows up if they have the incorrect zip code on their billing address so um but it's fixed
4012694	4015776	I don't know anything about going back to the sales.
4017396	4028902	But it was a week-long sale that offered on like 40 different games and DLC for Zombies Battle for Neighborville Complete Edition, like Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition, things like that.
4031123	4037447	And so people are fussing about having missed out on some of the time for the sale.
4037947	4040408	So we'll see how Nintendo addresses that part.
4042620	4042940	All right.
4044221	4046181	I didn't even look to buy anything.
4046741	4047041	I know.
4047322	4049782	I haven't really used the eShop in a while.
4049862	4054484	There hasn't been anything out like super recently anyway that I wanted to pick up directly from the eShop.
4054544	4061946	But bummer for people that want to take advantage of the sale because usually there's lots of scary games involved with that.
4062146	4062446	What?
4062586	4067248	To quote Kelly's dad, fiscal responsibility.
4068294	4075779	Well, I was going to say, the thing I've been most tempted to get on the Switch around Halloween was that Rocky Horror game that came out on the Switch and Steam.
4076639	4079521	I'm told it is still not out on PlayStation and Xbox.
4079661	4080402	It is planned.
4080462	4091709	The developer wrote an interesting series of bleats this week on Blue Sky that basically apologized for the delay, saying that he just has... I think it's all made by one guy, or at least the bulk of it is made by one individual.
4092289	4092409	And...
4093750	4096852	It just sounds like they weren't able to get things done on the timetable.
4096872	4098413	They wanted to get them done, but it's still coming.
4098493	4101816	And I'm like, Rocky Horror doesn't have to just be a Halloween thing.
4101876	4103136	Like, it'll be done when it's done.
4103176	4106459	But I want to pick it up on PlayStation 5, but I almost got it on Switch.
4107419	4109821	And that probably would have stopped me from doing that.
4109981	4111462	So it's a bummer.
4114304	4114664	All right.
4115525	4116125	Moving on.
4116405	4118847	Speaking of other things going on in the Switch, Loki.
4120287	4131115	Yep, so we've got word now, the surprise announcement, I guess, that Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition is coming to the Switch on March 20th, 2025.
4131895	4136678	That's going to have enhanced visuals and new story elements.
4137999	4145044	And yes, the first time it's been on the Switch, or the first time it's been out since the Wii U, and it hasn't been available for a long time.
4145605	4148387	Is it going to be on the next Switch console as well?
4148847	4149087	Who knows?
4149667	4169314	but getting kind of close to the release of that so maybe you never know I did like XTX so I'll be curious to check this out on the Switch I don't know if I have time for all these games but I like to think I might sometimes you just gotta pick your battles yeah right
4172331	4176452	PrincePeachFuzz in chat says, would there ever be an OLR Rocky Horror stream?
4177693	4179933	Not that, I mean, because we can't really play the movie on here.
4179953	4184814	I mean, if you're talking about the game, I'll probably stream the game on my personal channel when it comes out on PlayStation.
4185354	4188395	As far as like a full OLR production, I don't know.
4188615	4191476	Maybe if we want to get to, it's not multiplayer though.
4191496	4192616	That's the only thing that's kind of a bummer.
4193276	4195897	If it was, I would say, sure, we could try to get together and do it.
4195957	4197217	But I don't know.
4197987	4225652	so but I just want to play the game so I'm excited it'll be out on PlayStation 5 but I think achievements and trophies are the things that are holding it up they're not quite in the game yet because they're not in the Switch version of the game and they have to be there for PlayStation and Xbox it's part of their that's the thing it's like so silly that like why that hasn't been implemented on the Switch so far like I mean it's too late now but like but maybe not for the successor certainly that should be something for the successor it's like
4227000	4244867	everybody else has them but you I know I know it's like okay well trust me I've been making a whole thing out of retro achievements and it's like if only Nintendo embraced this stuff within Nintendo Switch Online it would be really cool but they're a decade behind so you know what was 10 years ago okay 2014 what's the peak 2014 online infrastructure goes out there
4251687	4251987	All right.
4268366	4273950	Coming out on November 8th, the second expansion, The Last Console War, is going to be available.
4274391	4277993	And my understanding is this is something you just get.
4278133	4283497	You get this, oh no, Atari VCS gets it as a free update early next year.
4284138	4287720	I don't think this is free DLC for everybody else.
4287861	4293365	This is going to be something, I can't tell if this is something that you have to pay for or not.
4293665	4296287	But I'm going to assume you do because we had to for the last one.
4296907	4297648	And it's pretty rich.
4297708	4303772	It's going to be adding 19 more games and 8 video interviews talking about Atari versus Intellivision.
4304493	4305514	And this is the interesting thing.
4305634	4310197	It's actually focusing on Mattel making games for Atari systems.
4310617	4319344	So no, it does not have Intellivision games in it by name, but it does have what Mattel started making for the M network.
4319864	4321205	So kind of interesting.
4321525	4324628	And so we get a big chunk of those games, which include...
4325308	4353966	Air Raiders, AntBear, Armor Ambush, Astro Blast, Frogs and Flies, International Soccer, Dark Cavern, Star Strike, Super Challenge Baseball and Football, Sword Fight, Sea Battle, Tower of Mystery, Video Pinball, Basketball, Hardball, oh these are some other uh sorry those were all the M Network games and then we have Video Pinball, Basketball, Hardball, Final Legacy, Zari Arena, and Desert Falcon for the 7800 are all coming out as well so that's kind of neat um
4354927	4383545	that that is all coming this week and that when all is said and done I think that means there will be 130 games in Atari 50 so good on them you know we've talked a lot about preservation and I realize like that's kind of Atari's whole MO right now is really just like trying to make the most of their legacy content which has had mixed results some of it's been very good some of it's not so good but Atari 50 and you know the things that Digital Eclipse has been doing ever since they kind of became a part of that whole family is
4384025	4407451	is good I think Atari 50 is great so this adding value to that whole thing I think is really cool and it's admittedly a part that I know nothing about like of course I know about Intellivision I had no idea Mattel was making games for Atari at some point in the process so I think that's really cool so I think everybody was at one point yeah so yeah it's true it's true all right well since I brought up retro games it's a great time to go into our next segment
4418092	4425398	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4425858	4428841	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4430342	4432383	A little bit of the logo coming in there.
4432504	4440030	DarkSakura, once a month here on the show in 2024, we talk about the classic cancelled game of the month.
4440470	4442251	So a game that never was.
4442371	4445454	DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic cancelled game this week?
4446351	4451797	I really wish I had more footage of this to show everybody, but it's Sam and Max Freelance Police.
4453419	4459226	It was a graphic adventure game that was developed by LucasArts from 2002 until 2004.
4460848	4465954	It was supposed to be the final game in their whole adventure game era.
4467394	4475218	It was intended to be released for Windows in early 2004 as a sequel to the 1993 version Sam & Max Hit the Road.
4476058	4478299	And based, of course, on the comics.
4480380	4485622	In fact, this actually involved the series creator Steve Purcell during this.
4486283	4487743	It was showcased at E3 2023, announced August 2002.
4491845	4501154	And this was supposed to be a point-and-click game, but instead of using stuff like SCUMM and GrimE, it actually had a 3D engine, so it was a full 3D point-and-click.
4502796	4510203	And it was actually led by Michael Stemmel, who was one of the original designers for Sam & Max Hit the Road.
4511044	4511264	So...
4513567	4538364	it really disappointed a lot of people when it was cancelled and one really sad thing about this is that this was one of the preludes to LucasArts cancelling their adventure game division but a lot of the people who worked on this game actually went to form Telltale Games
4539745	4541487	and kept creating adventure games.
4543169	4550238	Steve Purcell moved Sam & Max to Telltale in 2005 to help revive the Sam & Max video games.
4551835	4576749	so anyway like I said this was a graphic point and click 3D graphics, real time rendered and the game engine had things from other LucasArts games like from Gladius or Full Throttle Hell on Wheels or Star Wars Obi-Wan fully shaded bump map, light map, everything but it was meant to give it a 2D feel to a 3D game
4579551	4587258	and it was supposed to follow a different control scheme from things like Grim Fandago and Escape from Monkey Island but it was a point and click.
4588279	4602652	It had minigames, some of them optional, some compulsory and it was designed so that you would not die or reach a dead end so you could always find your way out of something.
4604374	4631172	and it was described as being six stories held together by a single overarching plot and they were each a separate case for the freelance police including a space station and going to a neo-pagan bacchanal bad guy stuff all kinds of just weirdness because I mean hey it's a it's Sam and Max so
4633323	4657639	LucasArts actually had considered releasing the game episodic but because of all the stuff going into it they wanted to do it as one single traditional distribution and there were supposed to be some power-ups in the game and new interactive cases as DLC but it didn't happen so anyway
4659907	4670435	LucasArts didn't put really a whole lot of detail out there when they announced the game, but they still projected it to be an early 2004.
4671235	4675939	They presented the trailer, which is what we have for those who are watching live.
4678482	4681364	It had the original voice actors, Bill Farmer, Nick Jameson.
4682604	4684145	They were going to do their roles.
4685486	4688107	Everybody was really into this game coming out.
4688167	4689208	Everyone was on it.
4692109	4698193	At the time, LucasArts was also in production on a full throttle Avenger game sequel called Hell on Wheels.
4699333	4704458	and they halted production on that but they still said Freelance Police was going to happen on time.
4706059	4715227	There were interviews, there were all kinds of stuff going on and then they, as their general manager, Mike Nelson, I will read this verbatim,
4715948	4729397	After careful evaluation of current marketplace realities and underlying economic considerations, we've decided that this was not the time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC.
4730177	4733860	And people didn't like it, including Steve Purcell.
4735941	4738643	He was saying the game was coming along great.
4738723	4739584	It was on schedule.
4742205	4746889	He was pleased with the writing quality, the gameplay, the animation, the 3D world.
4746969	4749010	He was really happy with it.
4749831	4759958	And said that it was a shame to think their accomplishments as well as the goodwill that has been growing in the gaming press toward this project will all go to waste due to this short-sighted decision.
4759998	4760738	That's what he said.
4762662	4779736	and the voice actors were never told about the game's cancellation they found out when they looked it up online and very disappointed again so with the formation of Telltale that's when
4781192	4790380	The Freelance Police mini cases were turned into an episodic series of the games.
4790820	4796545	Not a lot of the work from Freelance Police was carried over since LucasArts still held onto the game's assets.
4798326	4804772	So they turned what they could and they got Sam & Max Save the World in October 2006.
4806913	4833673	um but part of the plot summary was used in Poker Night 2 talking about an off-screen adventure that they had during the course of the game and um it was uh one of it was the thing that they were going to do with the giant penguins in the land of Subarctica which was renamed Zizobia in Poker Night 2 where Max was worshipped as a god um and then um
4837228	4844312	One of the plots in the game is that Sam and Max are going to switch each other's brains and the voice actors are going to do impressions of each other's characters.
4844432	4846113	That would have been hilarious.
4847194	4853177	But at any rate, we've got some holdovers, but the game itself is lost to us.
4854118	4861942	Maybe one day someone will find a disc sitting in a LucasArts dumpster and we'll have it.
4864746	4865286	You never know.
4865466	4868307	Sometimes that's how those cancelled games show up eventually, right?
4868547	4868727	Yep.
4869087	4869868	Alright, there it is.
4870368	4870988	R.I.P.
4872308	4875189	Salmon Axe Freelance Police.
4875449	4877650	Your classic game of the week.
4877690	4879110	Classic cancelled game.
4879130	4880711	Classic cancelled game of the week.
4881511	4881891	Alright.
4882371	4883992	Bobby says it's in the Disney vault now.
4885592	4888513	Petition Disney, bring back Salmon Axe Freelance Police.
4889554	4896597	Alright, let's travel around and check out some other headlines rather rapidly in what we call Rapid Fire News.
4897637	4900098	Let's go over to Loki to start us off.
4901378	4911742	Yes, apparently Final Fantasy XIV is now partnering with Logos, an outdoor camping company.
4913358	4919623	to provide some camping gear with Final Fantasy 14 stuff on it.
4920123	4920944	To which I say, 14?
4923325	4924386	Why not 15?
4924867	4927349	That's all you did in 15 was camp around.
4929110	4930931	Come on, missed opportunity there.
4931732	4934654	But I guess, you know, 14 is better than nothing.
4935675	4941139	If you're interested, that stuff goes on pre-order here Friday, November 15th.
4943206	4945267	and you can get all sorts of things.
4945427	4946567	That tent looks very small.
4948108	4948468	But whatever.
4950249	4952409	I love the comment it's a missed opportunity for $15.
4952529	4956031	It is absolutely a missed opportunity for $15.
4956951	4959732	However, their products are expensive.
4959992	4960873	So just keep that in mind.
4961653	4962893	Their tents are from $100 to $3,000.
4962953	4963053	Yikes.
4963073	4963173	Yeah.
4963213	4963473	Anyways...
4972014	4997909	yeah and then uh one other thing I was also gonna uh bring up as well not only that but Final Fantasy 14 is also teamed up with and I cannot pronounce this brand of I'm gonna try anyways it's Schwarzkopf I guess uh it's a uh hair dye for um yeah I've used their their hair dye before yeah it's a hair dye company so they're also teaming up with them you can get all your
4998444	5014793	Final Fantasy XIV character hair colors now in for like cosplay and stuff like actually, yeah, I get it yeah it's interesting you go camping and cosplay, there you go camping and cosplay, a perfect combination
5015766	5018308	PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4
5043386	5065921	so those are going to be your new games that are available from November 5th through December 2nd and part of the PlayStation Plus Essential Subscriber lineup because they have tears now like the tears coming out of my eyes for how disappointed I am in them that's it moving over to DarkSakura
5068159	5070161	There is going to be a musical for Castlevania.
5072863	5081211	Well, they've already done the Great Ace Attorney series, so there was that.
5082312	5085334	But this is going to be called a musical romance.
5086455	5106511	and it's going to be running from June 7th to July 20th 2025 at the Takarazuka Grand Theater and then August 16th to September 28th 2025 at Tokyo Takarazuka Theater with tickets to go on sale May 17th 2025 and then July 13th 2025 for the other showing it
5114878	5123941	It's going to be performed by the Flower Troupe that's led by C. Nakatsuki with script and direction being written by Kei Suzuki.
5125622	5132504	Also was the one who worked on the musicals for Ace Attorney and Sengoku Basara.
5133045	5133885	So, cool.
5136474	5139656	Alright, I'm very curious to see what turns out with that.
5140056	5141676	Anything to not put out a new game.
5143117	5145878	Meaning a new new game, not a rehashing of the old games.
5145898	5148620	This isn't Konami, it's just another troop licensing it.
5148700	5152741	I know, but it's still within the Konami universe and the use of their IP.
5152781	5155523	I'm just frustrated that we haven't had a new Castlevania game in I don't know how long.
5156471	5163216	Anyway, well, you know, speaking of rehashing all the old hits again, we just were talking about Toaplan last week.
5163276	5163897	And guess what?
5164217	5170602	I'm talking about it again tonight because we have another Toaplan game that's coming out.
5170722	5176266	It is a set of shoot-em-up games, of course, getting reissued by RetroBit.
5177087	5180870	It is the Toaplan Genesis and Mega Drive collection.
5181010	5183392	It's the Toaplan Shooters Collection Volume 2 collection.
5183952	5202851	and it is going to include Twin Cobra, Grindstormer and Slap Fight MD uh which of course were for the Genesis and Mega Drive so that's pretty cool and also the first time Slap Fight MD was released in North America the other two were um already done so you know that's that's that um
5203732	5205713	Apparently that is the original Japanese.
5206454	5209035	It's not some localization funny thing.
5209956	5214599	But yeah, it's apparently has a remake and remix mode in it.
5214839	5218741	And Yuzo Koshiro is actually a part of the score, which is kind of cool.
5218921	5219382	Nice.
5219602	5219862	Yeah.
5220002	5221203	So very cool.
5222543	5223164	You can check that out.
5223804	5224024	All right.
5224044	5232109	Well, if you want to see a game that's coming out real soon for you nearby, check out the world release dates of games in your region.
5232129	5233250	We'll start with the U.S., Loki.
5234302	5236984	We have Tinkertown on Nintendo Switch.
5237765	5240286	That game that I just said was going to be free.
5240366	5241027	Well, free.
5241347	5241707	Free.
5242548	5243468	With PlayStation Plus.
5243548	5247031	Death Note Killer Within on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
5248251	5254135	Mel's Slug Tactics on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

5320783	5323285	which I think they have a really cool controller for that as well, by the way.
5324806	5330710	And then we have Versace Evermore Epic Light Chorus on Nintendo Switch.
5331531	5339737	And last but not least, I think this is a scary one, Slitterhead on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5340658	5340898	Okay.
5342029	5345090	Traveling to Japan on the Nintendo Switch this week on November 7th.
5345410	5349350	The Alchemist of Ars Magna is coming out in a regular and special edition.
5349750	5354691	Of course, Mario & Luigi Brothership is pretty much a worldwide release as a lot of the big Nintendo games tend to be.
5355291	5356812	That is also out on November 7th.
5357232	5361732	Battle Spirits Crossover also out in Japan this week on the Switch.
5362152	5366333	River City Saga Three Kingdoms Next is out as well.
5366453	5370654	And yes, this looks like it's the Three Kingdoms game
5371636	5376578	Like Romance of the Three Kingdoms but mixed with the River City Ransom.
5376838	5378078	Romance of Kunio-kun.
5378218	5379619	That sounds really cool.
5380019	5381079	So check that out.
5381399	5385040	Goat Simulator 3 gets a Switch release in Japan this week.
5385160	5388681	So if you haven't had a chance to check that out, you have a chance now in Japan.
5390042	5391462	That is it for the Switch this week.
5391522	5392583	Checking out the PlayStation 5.
5392923	5394823	I imagine there's a lot of the same stuff.
5394883	5396344	Battle Spirits Crossover.
5396904	5397744	is out in Japan.
5398185	5400926	Taiko no Tatsujin, a brand new controller to go with.
5400986	5404727	Taiko no Tatsujin Rhythm Festival also out this week in Japan.
5405348	5411790	Some new PlayStation 5 controller types, including Chroma Pearl and Chroma Indigo are also out in Japan this week.
5411830	5417052	And I think that's to go with probably the new Pro release and all that good stuff that's coming out in Japan as well.
5417432	5421074	That same Slitterhead game that Loki was talking about also out in Japan.
5421134	5426156	But of course, because this is Japan, you can have a regular or you can have a limited edition.
5426636	5436376	Dead Rising also the deluxe remaster hitting Japan this week as well and that's it so let's move on to Europe DarkSakura

5556696	5556956	Sorry.
5557197	5558237	I was like, that other shit came out.
5559298	5569229	Okay, we will go to some other few news stories and then we're going to take your calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord in just a little bit.
5569750	5572373	If anybody wants to call in, we also, of course, have our mailbag.
5572433	5574055	I don't know if we have anything, but we'll check.
5574695	5590080	and then we do have a couple things to read off our Blue Sky feed because now that's a thing which by the way I forgot to mention earlier in the show but our Blue Sky handle did get updated to be verified by our domain so Jason pulled a miracle as he usually does and helped us get the orangelaunchradio.com
5590640	5591160	It's just different.
5591180	5591420	It's better.
5591440	5591900	Yeah, it's better.
5591940	5592380	All right, anyway.
5592400	5595141	Well, it is missing a couple things, but at least you're not supporting you-know-who.
5595161	5596901	Okay, let's get to those news stories.
5596921	5597021	Loki.
5614144	5618688	Yeah, so there's some more news coming about the Playdate.
5619309	5620990	And yeah, it's pretty exciting.
5621450	5626995	So the Playdate launched, was it back in 2019, I believe.
5627536	5634522	And it was actually, may have been delayed a little bit, but I know that Season 1 was included with the Playdate.
5634582	5637965	So what it was is that you got like, I think it was like 24 games, 20 games played.
5640727	5649373	that were essentially unlocked once a week on the playdate as time went on and it was kind of included with the price of the system and it was really cool.
5649393	5656999	There was a lot of really good games from a lot of independent game developers and now they're kind of doing that all over again.
5657039	5664804	They announced that Season 2 is actually going to be coming early next year and we don't know necessarily what's going to be in that.
5665104	5666966	Is that going to be included for free?
5667066	5668527	Is it going to be something that we pay for?
5668587	5669948	I mean, it's still worth paying for because it's
5670368	5695916	I think it's really awesome the games that you got in it but there's also another feature that they haven't talked about yet that they're also going to be revealing as part of that and then along with that they're going to be doing a kind of a sale on the catalog which is basically the games that are out right now their storefront so there's gonna be a sale going on between I believe now and the 14th um
5698849	5699469	of this month.
5699589	5705693	So if you're definitely using the playdate or want to pick one up, I'd say now's a good time to do that.
5706673	5708014	A lot of good games on there.
5708034	5711036	I keep buying stuff for it and my kids keep playing it.
5711096	5718020	I haven't been playing it as much, but it does get gameplay at least once a week.
5721363	5722265	I still want to get one.
5722405	5726374	Got a cool train sim game that's all 3D and stuff.
5726414	5727897	It's pretty cool.
5728038	5731225	It's amazing the stuff that you can pull off on those systems.
5732230	5733571	Does the crank like power the train?
5733591	5734332	Because that's kind of fun.
5734952	5736313	It does.
5737214	5746281	It does like the it's for the speed control because you know the speed control on trains is kind of like a vertical crank and so yeah it's using that to brake.
5746701	5751785	I don't because once again it's a train sim game and I don't know how to play those at all.
5752786	5760812	So I'm very lost but you have to like speed up and then brake so you don't get too late and you want to slow down for the stations and stuff and
5761593	5768141	I'm sure somebody that plays Train Sims would actually understand how to play that game, but it's really cool looking for that little device.
5770859	5778362	Alright, well we have one more story for you guys, and it has to do with, oh, I'm sure Ubisoft is setting themselves up for success with this one.
5778962	5785204	And yes, they have actually released their first ever blockchain game, which involves NFTs.
5785724	5794307	Ubisoft had announced this game last June, after talking about, basically threatening that for some time they were going to get into the blockchain, but now they have launched this game quietly.
5794747	5800329	It is available on the PC, and it is free to start, so it's free to play, but of course you can purchase...
5800569	5804071	I don't know why something is being sold for that much, but there are some things where I prefer to be ignorant.
5804091	5804131	Um...
5822145	5823486	Just don't.
5823626	5824327	Or just do.
5824467	5824988	I don't care.
5825008	5826389	You're an idiot if you buy it.
5826549	5827210	I mean, I'm sorry.
5827470	5833636	You can also play this game without the figurines, but I'm sure it will be much better for you if you do buy the figurines.
5834777	5835197	Let's see.
5836098	5839741	Of course, there's nothing about this game that looks like it's unique or what have you.
5840342	5845907	The studio director at Ubisoft Paris in an interview with IGN said the game offers deep strategic gameplay.
5846427	5846727	Sure does.
5846747	5847027	Sure does.
5869453	5882459	it because it is cryptocurrency involved I had no idea that that would be we're going to have some crime some actual detective work and then full penetration and then more detective work and then more full penetration
5883559	5883940	None of that.
5885281	5890505	Just throwing it out there, there was an NFT platform launched by Ubisoft previously called Quartz.
5891386	5898111	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon was the first game on it, and it only sold 15 NFTs, according to early reports.
5898612	5901835	But Ubisoft was saying the players just don't get it.
5902715	5904297	Just don't get it.
5904317	5906318	All we have to sell is one of those $64,000 things, and we've made big.
5906338	5906438	Yeah.
5911903	5912083	Mm-hmm.
5941502	5941782	All right.
5943543	5945603	But we're willing to talk to you all for free.
5945623	5949445	They have against the company about, you know, sexual conduct and harassment and stuff like that.
5949485	5952186	But, you know, that's another thing they could do.
5952966	5955807	Just this is yet another thing out of Ubisoft that's going to flop.
5957267	5962889	And I just, you know, unfortunately, the wrong people will be let go for it.
5964950	5970232	And it's like a game development studio had to make that, unfortunately.
5972779	5976722	Alright, let's go around and get some listener comments.
5977523	5982367	Every week we invite your comments over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com via the mailbag.
5982808	5984769	I'm not sure we got any, but I'll check.
5984870	5985090	Nope.
5986710	5989831	There's some spam in here, but I already fried it up and had it on the Subie.
6011597	6017523	Since these seem to be the two big games that social media was talking about, we did get a response from WayneN12 who said, Get it!
6017543	6020566	Well, you've got DarkSakura's opinion for sure.
6020586	6021707	I will jump in this week.
6021747	6024430	I'm trying to get my retro stuff all done in advance tonight.
6032338	6032919	DarkSakura.com
6055257	6084013	um but yes I I'm gonna check that out very soon I'm excited to get in on that so uh but you can send us uh stuff as well if you'd like to via blue sky uh you can also uh give us a shout out in chat if you have any questions or anything you want to talk about twitch.tv slash VOG network uh dark to see you talking about I'm busy finishing my replay of Chrono Trigger and the Castlevania Dominus stuff plus the rest of CV Chronicles yeah that's one of those rainy day games I'd love to get to I need to take two weeks of awful work like Loki so I can catch up on gaming
6084835	6090261	Except, I kind of, I mean, I have a lot of time off available.
6090381	6093925	It's like, I really can't justify taking two weeks off of work to stay at home and play video games.
6094325	6097969	A week to go on a cruise, four days to go to Nashville, yes.
6098550	6102354	Stay home and play video games, maybe one or two days, but not two weeks.
6104640	6106001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6132029	6135692	I think also they took time off when Zelda Tears of the Kingdom came out.
6136853	6139095	And again, I'm like, you know what?
6139175	6141557	That is absolutely a legitimate reason.
6141597	6142338	That's totally fair.
6142498	6149304	This individual works hard, and if this is how they get their brain break, totally fair.
6149984	6150525	I support it.
6150625	6151065	I really do.
6151946	6153367	Vacay time is your time.
6153487	6154008	That's right.
6154108	6155769	No one needs to know what you take it off for.
6156230	6156870	And that's also...
6157847	6158148	DarkSakura.com
6168636	6169537	Period dot.
6169917	6171098	Is that true in every state?
6171318	6172339	I'm legit questioning.
6172359	6173579	I believe it is.
6173760	6175120	I believe it's federal level.
6175341	6177702	Okay.
6177742	6178403	Going to chat.
6178923	6181385	The Breakman says, two weeks off to play video games?
6181485	6182205	We can do that?
6182345	6191792	Well, I mean, as part of the terms of employment, you get to negotiate compensation that usually includes time off, vacation, that sort of thing.
6192372	6197115	And as DarkSakura kind of referenced, when you want to take vacation, you don't have to tell them why.
6198896	6209743	Most people I've ever interacted with in my life, if you're like, I just need two days for like a mental wellness break, I've known very few people in my past that would say, no, you can't have it.
6210284	6214887	Like people support that kind of stuff and you want to avoid burnout type of thing.
6215227	6221711	And if a mental wellness break for you is I'm going to slay demons in Diablo for 72 hours straight, then more power to you.
6221771	6222532	It's nobody's business.
6223012	6223692	Not that I've ever done that.
6223712	6225473	I've taken two days off to do nothing but sleep.
6225493	6226134	Yeah.
6227375	6227995	I'm serious.
6228076	6228716	I have a condition.
6228996	6229997	Yeah, no, I get it.
6230918	6234540	I took a day off, I think, for one of the Final Fantasy XIV expansions, I want to say.
6235240	6236341	That was a while ago.
6236541	6237602	Not a new recent one.
6237802	6240924	I remember skipping school for a week to play Final Fantasy 3, 6.
6243166	6246088	I remember being sick from school to play Final Fantasy 3.
6246728	6247489	I do remember that.
6248530	6249190	That was some time ago.
6249310	6251372	I'm looking at chat for some other comments on this.
6252332	6252693	Let's see.
6253813	6257897	Uh, S2100Matt responding to the original bleat says the correct answer is both.
6258378	6260800	You can have the trading card game battle on auto.
6260880	6261561	That is true.
6261601	6262922	That is one thing I really like about it.
6263003	6265085	Even though I'm learning, I did win a battle by myself.
6265465	6266946	I love that you just have the computer do it.
6266986	6269369	You just have to build the decks and let them do it and hope it wins.
6269509	6270730	But you know, there's that.
6271131	6273913	The Breakman says I've taken a day off for a game, but weeks.
6274134	6275315	I mean, that's up to you.
6275595	6276396	Cause here's the thing.
6276956	6277397	Here's the thing.
6278649	6279529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6296318	6298279	Unless you're Loki, then yes, you play Minecraft.
6298559	6300080	I am taking two weeks off for that.
6300340	6301281	All fucking day.
6302161	6303242	It's productive stuff.
6303342	6305483	I have to design things and film things.
6305563	6307484	It's your hobby, right?
6309565	6315589	Everybody I work with knows that nerd conventions are my hobby.
6316689	6319331	I'm very fortunate that people are full-on supportive.
6319911	6322793	Yeah, you want to go to DragonCon and host these panels and stuff?
6322853	6323573	That's cool.
6323673	6324234	Go do it.
6325234	6340278	as long as the work is getting done that's the most important part as long as there's coverage it's awesome it's also the punishment for making me come into the office for three days which was an absolute cannot be understated waste of time I forgot that was a thing you had to do
6342438	6344979	Like, there was no point to any of it.
6345019	6347059	But it was so essential that I was there.
6347659	6348680	Absolutely essential.
6348700	6352781	I got to listen to all the people screw around while I had stuff that I actually had to do.
6353361	6359382	And meetings that I didn't need to be in because I'd been at that company for so long that it's just immersion stuff.
6359402	6362463	Like, here's what other people on your team do.
6362483	6363783	It's like, I know what you guys do.
6364003	6365004	I've been here that long.
6365044	6365944	I know what you...
6366906	6368947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6392230	6392550	Wow.
6392710	6395653	No, I mean, I think it just depends.
6395973	6401257	I don't like to talk a lot about my day job on air for obvious reasons, and I know I have coworkers that listen.
6401317	6402178	Hi, you know who you are.
6402958	6415148	But the thing with all that is that I went into the office because I had to be â€“ I don't want to give away too much, but there was a thing that I needed to be there for an hour because it was the type of thing you can only do in person.
6415168	6415989	I'm just going to leave it at that.
6416309	6421393	So I had to go into the office, but I actually â€“ I was like, because I could have a whole office to myself â€“
6421733	6424474	The cats weren't screaming at me all day to distract me.
6424814	6426935	I was kind of forcing myself out of my normal environment.
6426995	6428875	I actually felt like I had a super productive day.
6430435	6435177	But again, different than Loki's experience because not everybody was there.
6435217	6437737	It was just the group I was doing a certain thing with.
6437778	6440158	And I was like, this was nice to have a little break.
6440738	6442759	And I wanted to do it in part.
6443099	6444059	That's a big difference too.
6444519	6446560	I like going to work because the cafeteria.
6447921	6451184	Well, yeah, we don't have any of that anymore either because that's all been shut down.
6451264	6458732	So, like, on top of that, like, it was you know, it was funny because it was very quiet and very loud at the same time.
6458832	6462815	So, like, I got there, I'm working on my stuff because I'm not going into any of these meetings.
6462876	6463756	I'm essentially just coming in
6464679	6466240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6482450	6485671	Then another co-worker of mine actually comes in a few days later.
6485731	6488772	Why can't they keep those personal phone calls to the bathroom like everybody else?
6489052	6491013	Or just like go take them somewhere else.
6491093	6494254	But it's like, I guess you're just used to the office being pretty empty.
6494314	6495695	So you just, whatever.
6496655	6501637	I had some other co-workers come in and just goof off for four hours.
6501937	6507359	Like if you think the idea is that you come into the office to be more productive, that ain't happening.
6507539	6511380	It was just them gossiping and flirting for four hours.
6512851	6514312	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6541616	6542636	There's a song.
6543417	6549239	I don't know the name of the song, but part of the chorus starts off and says, I've had better days.
6549679	6552340	That has been my motto for the last two months.
6553200	6556141	Sorry to hear it, but I hope at least today was a good one.
6556401	6557902	Thank you for sharing part of your day with us.
6561163	6561523	Better.
6561823	6566265	Oh, you have a weird noise gate because you went silent for five seconds and it all came in at once.
6566365	6566765	That's all right.
6567150	6568451	Oh, I apologize.
6568511	6571893	I'm in the brand new studio and evidently I've been reaped.
6573154	6576595	Yeah, I've been recalibrating the microphone to save my own arse.
6576616	6577716	So I apologize.
6577776	6578076	I got you.
6578116	6582259	Check the noise gate because that's the thing I think that's giving you a little problem, but you're fine now.
6582759	6583860	What's on your mind, my friend?
6585541	6594606	I want to power up with the whole life balance and work and cons and hobbies.
6594666	6596367	I have a story.
6596960	6597140	Okay?
6597160	6598040	Uh-oh.
6599381	6606542	So, you know how in most places, the main rule is if you want time off, you have to put in two weeks in advance.
6608523	6609383	Places, three.
6610043	6610263	Sure.
6611183	6612644	At my job, we have two systems.
6612984	6615984	We have the HR system, and we have a ticketing system.
6616304	6623606	When you put it through the ticketing system, it sends everybody into the department like a calendar event to let people know you're going to be out of the office that day.
6624773	6637437	That's convenient, that's convenient So I do that whenever I I'm like, oh, I'm going to be at a con And I do this Last year, a co-worker walks up to me like Oh, can you cover my shift on Friday?
6637457	6641859	I'm like, no What do you mean you're not going to be here?
6642159	6643999	I took Friday off Where are you going?
6644640	6651922	I'm going to a con Oh, I know where this is going Sorry, I know the punchline here And it's going to piss me off, but go ahead
6655117	6656658	Can we trade off?
6656698	6657758	Because Friday's my birthday.
6657778	6659679	I'm like, sorry, dude, can't help you.
6660219	6660740	I took the time.
6660760	6662360	I already put the time in, you know?
6663761	6665842	So all that said and done.
6666722	6676447	And this co-worker tends to just let people know at the very last minute they're taking time off.
6676527	6679008	So this happened in September.
6680190	6682271	and all of that.
6682911	6687352	So I figured, okay, my boss knows I'm looking for a place.
6687412	6688252	I found a place.
6689652	6690873	I'll speak to him on Monday.
6692453	6694794	I'll send him an email on Monday or talk to him on Tuesday.
6694814	6696914	I can tell him the reason.
6696974	6706077	I know this is last minute, but I need to leave work early this whole week so I can finish packing stuff up and put it in my new place or in storage.
6706917	6707477	Simple as that.
6709602	6712823	Tuesday morning, black notification.
6714703	6715864	Coworker says we need to talk.
6716324	6717744	I'm like, what's up?
6718384	6722585	Like, oh, I'm not coming in today.
6724086	6725946	What do you mean you're not coming in today?
6727187	6729067	Did you forget I'm getting married this weekend?
6730027	6731868	No, I didn't forget.
6732288	6734868	But why are you not coming in today?
6735589	6736809	Oh, I gotta take care of last night.
6738604	6757943	and I'm just staring at my screen and if you can picture a volcano on my head just exploding, you know, and I'm just like I'm glad I have anger management techniques from therapy.
6758163	6759264	You've learned to breathe.
6759344	6759965	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6761773	6762234	Thank you.
6778972	6804175	like grow up and don't go like because I've I've had that in the past not at my current employer but in the past I not so direct but like me reading between the lines was very much like oh I can feel this judgment coming down and back the f up this is my life not yours type of thing you know you know do you know how much notice we have to give at my job a month one hour huh
6805339	6809921	I mean, it really depends on where you're at because coverage, etc, etc.
6810342	6812083	But still, that's why you have to take a little planning.
6812203	6825750	So your co-worker probably should have thought, oh, it's possible that if I'm getting married on Saturday, I'm going to need Thursday and Friday at the minimum to take care of things that are going to come up last minute for my fucking wedding.
6826210	6833054	It's a little wild that they didn't have enough foresight to ask for a little extra time off around the weekend.
6834910	6841457	I would have understood completely if he said it in advance because I could have altered means and so forth.
6841897	6843619	I was still able to do so.
6844019	6848584	And I think what really got under my skin was at the time, there's only two people in the department.
6848844	6857553	Yes, we have remote techs and this and that, but it's, I'll tell you this, when the office discovers there's only one tech,
6859435	6860696	Slack explodes.
6860896	6863237	There's a line of people at my desk.
6863337	6868059	I have to put a sign up that says, send an email for support.
6868139	6871220	You know, I'm like, I'm doing everything that I can.
6871461	6873341	And there's five people in the office.
6873401	6876683	If they say jump, I go how high to make sure everything is.
6879059	6887167	Well, I guess the lesson learned here is there's no issue with taking work off to play video games, but just plan a little bit.
6887868	6893233	For most employers, you're going to have to give a little bit of notice at least that you plan to do that so that coverage can be worked out and all that good stuff.
6893293	6900060	But playing games is mental health for a lot of people or attending conventions or whatever your nerddom is.
6900080	6900420	Nerddom.
6901837	6902779	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6914344	6921732	I just felt happy going because it's like I'm going to see my New England cosplay convention squad.
6921972	6923233	I'm going to do photography.
6923273	6924654	I'm going to hang out with some peeps.
6924975	6926136	I'm going to make some friends.
6926276	6927697	I'm going to have a drink.
6928178	6932923	I actually reconnected with somebody I had a falling out with and we both matured over that.
6932963	6935205	I'm just like, what more can you ask for?
6935325	6936386	Yeah, yeah.
6938632	6942193	The last con I went to this past weekend, yeah, there were some things that happened.
6942213	6944453	I will tell you offline.
6944513	6947274	But overall, it still was a great time.
6947314	6953015	And a friend of mine did this panel on anime and the psychology behind it.
6953095	6955335	And it hit me personally.
6955375	6956116	And I spoke to him.
6956196	6958716	I'm like, this really hit close to home.
6958736	6959396	He's like, I'm sorry.
6959416	6960857	I'm like, oh, don't apologize.
6961097	6961737	I feel for it.
6961817	6962737	I understand.
6962997	6964877	So you've really connected with me.
6964917	6966178	So I really appreciate that.
6969669	6978696	And it's like, Monday, Thursday, day zero, let's go, let's do this, you know.
6979256	6981458	Or if it's a three-day con, Thursday.
6981838	6984880	Friday, let's go, we're going to do it, we're going to have a good time, you know.
6985580	6992345	I tell you, yes, there is that PCD, post-con depression that happens.
6993126	6995728	But you're just full of like this...
6996716	7002501	natural high just being there and just having a good time you're running around
7004088	7013517	3 Days, and Fancy Fabrics being a complete and total dork and everybody's giving you hugs and high fives and like, here, drink!
7014437	7020063	It's a type of expression that most of us have to suppress from 9 to 5 type of thing.
7020343	7021924	I think it's a lot of what it is.
7021985	7027470	You get to be your authentic self for a weekend and then you have to put on your work drag and go to work.
7028593	7034999	Unless you're in IT, because there's a lot of anime and nerd merch floating around.
7036080	7041185	And I did go to work on Halloween as Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, so you know.
7042807	7049333	They were doing dress-up, but I had the day off for a procedure.
7050339	7077428	I rarely have costumes anymore because I'm usually hosting on the weekend and more like eccentric host type of garb so that's usually all I end up having for Halloween so I guess I could go as Rod Roddy every year which is valid Rod Roddy's awesome, come on now Let's hear it though for having cosplay on hand because I easily converted my pig cosmetic into the actual Amanda from Saw outfit for the thing at Coin Op
7079548	7105283	I did one year I had gone to Rocky Horror as sexy pizza where I had one of those like cardboard pizza cutouts and then I was wearing like fishnets heels and like fishnet gloves and stuff because the joke was everything sexy on Halloween everybody dresses like a slut on Halloween so I went as sexy pizza and I actually I did reuse just the pizza part at work but with like you know a t-shirt and jeans and I was just like look I'm pizza but
7108902	7110803	Well, that's your sausage, right?
7111724	7112184	Ayo.
7112324	7112764	All right.
7113205	7115326	Ranma, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?
7116226	7118188	No, that's it, my friends.
7118228	7119188	What a note to end on.
7119528	7123010	Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights on the VOG Network.

7132621	7135145	Always good to hear from our power alma here on the show.
7135325	7135585	Yes.
7136006	7138169	Alright, well, with that, we are gonna wrap it up here.
7138289	7141053	Thank you so- well, actually, wait, I should get last-minute stories from Loki, sorry.
7141673	7143316	I don't know if there are any, but it's worth checking out.
7143336	7145559	There are no last-minute stories.
7147335	7149276	Yes, we have no last minute stories.
7163827	7167210	They go an awful long way, so thank you so much for all of that support.
7167930	7171833	We all appreciate the follows and support on our personal channels as well.
7172213	7174775	I know Loki is a YouTuber at LokiOLR.
7175155	7178137	DarkSakura is a Twitch streamer here at DarkSakuraTTV.
7178818	7184042	I am a little bit of both, but I will give you my YouTube for now, which is Rob Roberts Plays.
7185783	7187744	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
7187924	7191547	Speaking of DarkSakura on Twitch, I believe you're going to be... What are you playing tonight?
7191567	7193168	Are you going to play Dragon Age or are you going to play Debbie?
7193328	7194589	No, I'm playing Dead by Daylight.
7194849	7197771	I specifically got asked, are you playing Dead by Daylight tonight?
7197791	7200053	I'm like, yes, because I'm going to play with my friend Smokey.
7200233	7200573	Oh, fun.
7200713	7201714	Okay.
7201774	7204316	And I'm going to make udon because I'm fucking hungry.
7204396	7205296	Yum.
7205357	7206537	Any last words for our listeners tonight?
7207718	7212081	Um, um, um, no.
7212281	7212482	Bye.
7212822	7213262	Bye.
7213302	7213883	Have a good stream.
7214043	7214343	Hearts.
7214403	7215163	Love you all.
7215684	7215884	Okay.
7215904	7217025	Mwah.
7217045	7217685	We'll go over to Loki.
7217725	7218406	Your final thought tonight.
7219415	7224141	My final thought is there should be a new episode of my Minecraft series out tomorrow.
7224501	7225743	Lots and lots of building.
7226624	7231049	I have two Redstone Carnival minigames that are functional.
7231169	7234614	I have a merry-go-round that someone made for me that I...
7236189	7238492	fixed and changed the redstone on a bit.
7239534	7240976	That's also 100% functional.
7241196	7242478	And then another roller coaster.
7242558	7244841	That's another functional ride.
7245202	7246344	Lots of stuff.
7247165	7248847	I love all these theme park things you're doing.
7248887	7249308	That's great.
7251010	7251250	Awesome.
7252131	7252471	Tomorrow.
7252712	7254473	Alright, cool.
7254493	7259598	My final thought is now that Halloween is over, you know what?
7259638	7261280	We can keep Mariah on ice.
7261520	7264463	It is too early to celebrate Christmas.
7264663	7266264	It is too early to celebrate Christmas.
7266284	7266645	Hold on.
7267145	7268567	I gotta get a small soapbox here.
7268847	7269587	Okay, listen.
7271718	7276739	We gotta talk about Christmas and pushing the Christmas holiday stuff up too early.
7276759	7280500	I literally was hearing Christmas music November 1st.
7280680	7283461	Can we at least push that to after things?
7283741	7287282	We had a person in our neighborhood put Christmas decorations up October 31st.
7287522	7292663	They had it out there with their Halloween stuff and their Trump stuff.
7293644	7298825	It's still crazy, though, that we have people putting up inflatable decorations on
7300071	7301653	in October for Christmas.
7301713	7303315	Like, just give it a rest.
7303755	7309602	We cannot be in holiday season for just a couple weeks and then go into it.
7309662	7310122	Like, it's just...
7311206	7312127	Just give it a break.
7312947	7314288	Christmas music, November 1st.
7314348	7314928	Come on.
7315209	7316029	Come on, you guys.
7316189	7316449	I know.
7316870	7317370	You know what, though?
7317810	7318471	It came to mind.
7318931	7321913	Something you said there reminded me of what I really want to say here at the end.
7322013	7326456	I know I've been kind of trying to put this on ice because I have a lot of anxiety about it, as I'm sure a lot of you do.
7326916	7329358	But vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.
7329438	7331859	If you are here in the U.S., Tuesday is the day to vote.
7332240	7332840	Please vote.
7333160	7334301	We need the voices to be heard.
7334461	7337223	I know everybody's sick of hearing about the presidential election.
7337663	7339664	We've told you our opinions on that here on the show.
7340004	7341004	We hope you'll take them to heart.
7355928	7375169	you never rest on that stuff you go vote anyway because you vote in local elections and have your voice heard and all that other stuff because when they make these ridiculous rules to ban drag reading at the library and to piggyback on something that I said earlier if you hate drag queens reading to children don't take your kid to the event
7376681	7378161	Wow, what a fucking concept.
7378542	7382043	But most of those stupid bans are done at the local level.
7382423	7384263	So those type of elections really matter as well.
7384303	7385043	So please vote.
7385523	7390425	I'm sure all of you listening will do, but even if I just get one more person to vote that was like, oh shit, that is coming up, right?
7390465	7391825	I guess maybe I should return my ballot.
7392125	7393686	Then I will consider this a success.
7394066	7396026	So please vote and do the thing.
7396606	7397567	Have your voice be heard.
7397827	7401428	And no matter what happens Tuesday, we'll get through it.
7402247	7403467	But I'm trying to be hopeful.
7403827	7409608	I'm trying to, as was said on Saturday night, keep calm-a-la and carry on-a-la.
7411149	7412469	Did you see the Saturday Night Live bit?
7412489	7412909	Yes, I did.
7412989	7413869	It was so fucking good.
7413949	7414229	All right.
7414729	7415169	That's it.
7415269	7422711	On that note, as was the Chapel Roan song about her pleasing women, that was an amazing thing as well.
7423551	7425671	But we'll need a whole other three hours to talk about that.
7425751	7428752	So until then, until next week, have a wonderful week, everybody.
7428772	7429032	Good night.
