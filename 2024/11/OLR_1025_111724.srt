1
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:12,899
[SPEAKER_01]: A delayed game is eventually good, but a bad game is bad forever.

2
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Accepted as fact, touted as pure truth, and said it in error when it was relevant.

3
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:21,866
[SPEAKER_01]: The quote is slightly modified from its possible original form, but bad games have lately surmounted their forever bad status.

4
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:26,970
[SPEAKER_01]: No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy XIV's original release, Cyberpunk 2077, and now the Grand Theft Auto trilogy.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,112
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 640k of Memory Intro.

6
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:34,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this bug fix and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:36,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting right now on the show, wherever a gamer has a voice...

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:46,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,507 --> 00:01:01,935
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again here on Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com or twitch.tv slash vognetwork with episode number 1025 of our show taping on November the 17th of 2024.

11
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:08,899
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

12
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:31,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you know, I just realized that it's usually around this time of year that I lose my voice anyway.

13
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's inexplicable.

14
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:41,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, but in this case, I had a sinus infection that was paired with a really bad cold.

15
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:44,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still hacking up the stuff.

16
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:52,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to suggest tying it back to something that was discussed on Bobby's show this evening because we do tape live at VOG Network after Bobby Blackwolf every Sunday night at 9 Eastern.

17
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you are allergic to people putting up their holiday lights before Thanksgiving.

18
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have told you that.

19
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are also in agreement.

20
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the lights in the box until after Thanksgiving.

21
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:10,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for my neighbor that has the Christmas dragon.

22
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,497
[SPEAKER_02]: They're allowed.

23
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragons are accepted.

24
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragons are accepted.

25
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:24,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I still have my Halloween welcome mat that's a big spider web still on my front porch.

26
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:26,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't put away stuff yet.

27
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:30,085
[SPEAKER_02]: A welcome mat is not the biggest crime in the world.

28
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:42,675
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to give off Addams Family vibes 24 hours a day, 365 a year, I don't think... There's a fine line between holiday decorations and just Addams Family vibes.

29
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's fine to give off the Addams Family vibes.

30
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:53,864
[SPEAKER_04]: After Halloween, I go to Spirit and Joanne's and all that and pick up decorations for the house year-round on discounts.

31
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:54,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually...

32
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:58,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two things in my bathroom.

33
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say two-thirds of the people I know involved with the Rocky Horror Picture Show say the exact same thing.

34
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:15,486
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I'm really happy about is I have a toilet with a gravestone and then I have a skeleton leaning on a toilet checking her phone.

35
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,642
[SPEAKER_04]: and so those will be permanent in my bathroom.

36
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:21,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

37
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:30,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have my my skeletons doing yoga and I paint them just with an iridescent gloss so they kind of shimmer.

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in my cube at work.

39
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't taken down any of my decorations at work.

40
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, I haven't been there.

41
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And SSJ100 Matt, you know what?

42
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:58,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to deal with an HOA so fuck them and fuck their rules so SJ100 Matt bringing up if you're part of an HOA you better get those decorations down before you get ridiculously fined yeah that's a thing that's been good because unfortunately as a newer you know house I do have one of those and it's the most annoying thing about living here but it is what it is so

43
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:07,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to live somewhere where other people dictate to me what my home that I have paid for looks like.

44
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:10,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I view this as a stepping stone to our forever home.

45
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:15,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see, looking in chat, some other questions.

46
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:19,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love, Bobby was telling me about how his was set up and he says, my HOA is the best.

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a social HOA and has no architectural components.

48
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:24,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Covenants?

49
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:25,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Covenants.

50
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:28,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sorry, my eyesight's going bad today.

51
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:35,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they basically, like, they all pay for a pool, basically, but they don't do anything with, like, what your house has to look like, which is, I'm okay with that.

52
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with, like, a community pool, I guess.

53
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a community pool here.

54
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use it because it's a pee-pee pool.

55
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:45,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just know it's a toilet for kids, so I don't want to swim in it.

56
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what chlorine is for.

57
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:48,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Not enough.

58
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:48,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.

59
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,288
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough.

60
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:49,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.

61
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:50,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

62
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:52,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So some other comments from chat.

63
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil of Nine in chat says, Joanne's was a slay this holiday season, though.

64
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:57,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Halloween season.

65
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, specifically Halloween holiday.

66
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The only holiday I recognize.

67
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:06,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally.

68
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:10,938
[SPEAKER_04]: My voice, though, is extra rough today because I went to see Eddie Izzard.

69
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:12,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Professionally, Eddie Izzard.

70
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, Susie Izzard.

71
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:26,938
[SPEAKER_04]: for the retrospective comedy show and they filled the place with so much smoke machine smoke that my cough actually came back hardcore.

72
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,844
[SPEAKER_02]: What does Eddie Izzard need a smoke machine for?

73
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:35,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe it was Davis' idea?

74
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, who knows, yeah.

75
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was such a good show, and touching back on previous sketches, there was Cake or Death.

76
00:05:48,971 --> 00:06:16,812
[SPEAKER_04]: of course you don't do the greatest hits without cake or death there was another one that I loved but the flag did not happen that's okay but it was really good and if that tour is going anywhere that you are I don't want to spoil it for anybody just go see it it was really really good she was in full form amazing full of energy bouncing all over the stage also her legs looked really good I'm just going to say that right now

77
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:46,175
[SPEAKER_04]: and thank you for clarifying the name because I actually didn't know like what so Eddie Izzard's like a drag name at this point basically so it's like professional on stage name okay um but uh but yeah totally absolutely worth it I had such a good time um and all the people that were sitting between me and my friend Danielle they moved so Danielle could sit by me and we uh had grown-up drinks and laughed and

78
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:54,379
[SPEAKER_04]: The people sitting next to us on the other side were also really cool because they graduated the same year I did and we were all just talking about all this stuff.

79
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:54,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

80
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:55,739
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

81
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,820
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

82
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:04,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got to get over to... So we may be hearing from Jamie a little less tonight to let her voice relax so she won't be doing as many stories, but we will be checking with the Classic Game of the Week.

83
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:08,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, if she has an opinion, she's going to let you know.

84
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:11,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So she just might have to put up her hand or something if we can't hear her.

85
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:13,428
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure it'll be fine.

86
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see.

87
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to make sure we introduce Techmaster Loki because we got another comment in chat over at Twitch.com slash VOG Network that says, what the hell is this thing Loki has on?

88
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:26,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a game playing behind you tonight.

89
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:29,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely looks like some kind of meme thing that I'm not familiar with.

90
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,054
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this meme game you got?

91
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:40,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something I saw on the Steam store when I was looking at what came out recently and I had to...

92
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:42,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to have it.

93
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:52,150
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually supposed to be a pretty decent shooter and it's got the name you would expect it to have.

94
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,251
[SPEAKER_00]: So the full name, and I'm going to read it, is extremely long.

95
00:07:56,051 --> 00:08:00,092
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, because it's all the most awesome memes, right?

96
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:10,855
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 Blaze It 2 Game of the Year, Dank Dreams and Goated Memes, hashtag wow out of 11, like and subscribe, Poggers Edition is the full name of that game.

97
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thought you made it, to be quite honest.

98
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: If you told me that was a game on Steam, I would have been like, did Loki make that?

99
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:20,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish.

100
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:22,632
[SPEAKER_02]: All that's missing is Sephiroth.

101
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:25,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's probably a trademark name, so I probably can't use it.

102
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:26,513
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, yeah.

103
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:30,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's supposed to be pretty good.

104
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think Sephiroth could be trademarked because it's actually a religious term.

105
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:37,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

106
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It is part of the Kabbalah.

107
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:40,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe it can't then.

108
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, anyway.

109
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:43,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's what is missing.

110
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:49,230
[SPEAKER_02]: FifthDream in chat says, I've gone so long without hearing Dank.

111
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Streak is broken.

112
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:55,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this old and moldy memes, Loki, or is this like really funny stuff?

113
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,073
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be like 2014 memes, I think.

114
00:08:57,173 --> 00:09:05,136
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sequel to a game that came out in 2014, and I don't really understand what the reference is to a lot of this stuff.

115
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:08,538
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of visual vomit.

116
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:14,400
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's apparently a competent shooter, and that it's executing its theme

117
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:39,513
[SPEAKER_00]: well i guess i don't know it's got mostly positive reviews so so if it's 24 it's not going to have like the newer memes like skibbity toilet or you know i don't know no it's got like thomas the tank engine shrek okay dabbing stuff like that okay oh that definitely that sounds 2014 found any macho man i mean i don't know it it's got it's got a lot of

118
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on.

119
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,458
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

120
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interestingly enough caused a lot of comments.

121
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:32,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Xbox and Microsoft have been making a lot of announcements this week because we have a lot of stuff coming out of Blizzard this week too.

122
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to later in the show.

123
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,404
[SPEAKER_02]: But here at the top of the show, Loki, a lot of stuff coming out of Xbox.

124
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:41,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of randomly some different offhanded comments this week in the wake of the PS5 Pro, right?

125
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:42,876
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, you know,

126
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:33,467
[SPEAKER_00]: they're saying that the right now they're not really they think about hardware you know and how they can create unique value for players and as far as like you know does it make sense to put new hardware out obviously they are working on new hardware um but they said they don't want to do incremental hardware um right now um they have to essentially

127
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:41,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on hardware that's going to make, I guess, Xbox the best it could be, instead of just like, well, this console has slightly more storage.

128
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:50,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, that said, they just did that, so... I mean, it's not new hardware, but it's hardware that's a different skew, that has more storage.

129
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,564
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardware is kind of experimental.

130
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:58,886
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, we don't want to do that, but then also, we are doing that.

131
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:03,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what they're talking about is more of like performance, you know, with the PlayStation 5 Pro.

132
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:11,680
[SPEAKER_00]: That would get very confusing with Xbox series games or whatever.

133
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, now you have three different tiers that you're targeting for, like...

134
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:21,053
[SPEAKER_00]: as a developer to make things even more complicated.

135
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.

136
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.

137
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:43,952
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, you know, we're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles is another thing that basically that they want the price point of a new console to make sense for people buying those because it is, especially when you're talking about like, you know, PlayStation VR 2 and the PlayStation 5, you know, you add that all together, you are getting...

138
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty high prices.

139
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:54,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to experience PlayStation VR 2 games, which, I mean, there's not a lot of those, and I don't know how well they're supporting it.

140
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,196
[SPEAKER_00]: It may go the way of the Vita.

141
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:55,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

142
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:12,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they are saying, you know, some other questions that were asked to Phil Spencer talking about, of course, you know, this multi-platform strategy that they have and saying that, you know, there's no red line with exclusives.

143
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:18,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially that, you know, even something like Halo could possibly make it to other platforms.

144
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

145
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:48,859
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's interesting, he says I do not see sort of red lines with their portfolio that you must not do that it's too early to make any sort of decisions on the next version though of Halo probably because it's nowhere near done yet and we don't even know what the landscape is going to look like then and you know, hey, by then maybe we can target the next Nintendo console if it's powerful enough, who knows and then of course keeping the hope alive I guess

146
00:13:49,723 --> 00:14:12,743
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how they're working on a portable device but it's not going to be available anytime soon so I'm curious to see what that would be if that's going to be like an actual like Steam Deck type console more of a PC where you're utilizing xCloud type stuff with that maybe some of the PC Game Pass library things be interesting to see what they do with that

147
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be my guess is it's more of a competitor for the Steam Deck type of thing and it kind of leverages Game Pass where it makes sense and the cloud to deliver maybe some of the high high performance games might be relying on the cloud a little bit so you'll probably have to have

148
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:37,277
[SPEAKER_02]: really strong internet connection, whether that be at home or maybe something they're trying to wait for a little bit is better 5G type of availability.

149
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:40,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I fear it's not going to happen in the next four years, but we'll see.

150
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you never know.

151
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:47,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we don't know what the specs are going to look like in a few years, too, because if you think about that, they're looking to put a console out.

152
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:56,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it'd be weird to target Xbox Series S type specs, but I assume they could probably do something pretty decent.

153
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look at what the Steam Deck looks like right now.

154
00:14:58,313 --> 00:14:59,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

155
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:21,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's only going to be more powerful in four years so I could see them doing something like that but they did have to really make I think they couldn't just say oh it's a console to play games on the go I think it'd be better like to actually do something unique with it but who knows

156
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:29,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something that enables, I don't know, like multiplayer in the same room type of thing when you have more than one device.

157
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:36,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know that's not exactly a novel concept, but it might be something to maybe lean into a little more with some of the software offerings, right?

158
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:42,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Recognize that one thing that Nintendo does very well is the party in the room atmosphere type of games, right?

159
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Mario parties, the Mario karts of the world.

160
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:45,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo has a lot on that.

161
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:46,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and please don't try to...

162
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:52,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to, like, copy the Switch, you know, eight years too late or something like that, you know what I mean?

163
00:15:52,635 --> 00:16:00,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull, like, a PlayStation Move or a Microsoft Kinect nonsense, you know, just do something unique and new.

164
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:06,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they see that, you know, Steam Decks are gonna, that whole concept, and the Switch, you know, concept are here to stay, right?

165
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So that whole concept of a portable...

166
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:10,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming Unit that does a lot.

167
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:12,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interesting.

168
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:20,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I say Gaming Unit, but if it's a Microsoft device, why the hell shouldn't it lean into things like Word and Excel and PowerPoint on the go as well?

169
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's another way they sell it, is that it's not just for games.

170
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:30,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know to what extent you could craft a PowerPoint on a device like that, but

171
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:54,319
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be horrible well to maybe dock it you know okay but to be fair like I did an entire PowerPoint that well not not PowerPoint it's um Apple's version of it I did it on an iPad uh numbers thank you without a keyboard so um you can do a lot with touch screens so you know maybe you know some some refinements may be a little more difficult but it's it's

172
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty rich at this point, so it'll be interesting.

173
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:00,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that's a ways away.

174
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:08,265
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the thoughts of the Xbox games coming to other consoles?

175
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:12,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't... They already kind of did it.

176
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,070
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already been putting games on the Switch.

177
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't think Halo on the Switch is a big deal at all.

178
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:22,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo on the PlayStation would be very, very interesting.

179
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting because...

180
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby was talking on his show about the DLC for Atari 50 that came out this week which I haven't gotten around to yet because I was playing another game by Digital Eclipse this week which I'll talk about in a minute but the Atari 50 DLC that talks about the first console wars and how Intellivision is was making Atari versions of their games because the Intellivision and the Atari were such different hardware but it's like why would you limit yourself to just

181
00:17:55,686 --> 00:18:23,824
[SPEAKER_02]: the Intellivision segment of the market why wouldn't you tap into Atari's segment of the market and get as many sales as you can over there too when there's five times as many Atari's out there so it's interesting in light of like just hearing about that and in the shadow of this look back on this first game war how it's coming full circle where now Microsoft's going why wouldn't we just release it on Sony's platform well yeah it kind of harkens back to this whole like

182
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:32,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, are you talking about all these people coming out after the election deciding to show their entire ass and hole?

183
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,100
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway.

184
00:18:56,076 --> 00:19:03,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, I need to correct myself because when you said PowerPoint, my brain heard spreadsheet for some stupid reason.

185
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been talking about Excel as well, like the whole office suite of things, but yet personally I used Keynote.

186
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,627
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, the name just slipped my mind in the moment, but yeah.

187
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it.

188
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a little cringe, but I'm just going to be honest.

189
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Some software gets to that point of Xerox or Kleenex where it's a PowerPoint.

190
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:30,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but that's... Actually, more commonly, I hear keynote presentation more than anything in other medias.

191
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:33,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get into it.

192
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to present a keynote on so-and-so and so-and-so.

193
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so...

194
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:53,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it ever... You mean, yeah, when we were kids and, you know, in school and, like, rooting for consoles, okay, that makes sense because we're dumb kids and we don't know any better, but, like...

195
00:19:54,922 --> 00:20:00,207
[SPEAKER_00]: As adults rooting for a console and stuff like that, it's just silly.

196
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it.

197
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:04,290
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense for Microsoft to put their games in.

198
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:09,134
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically to get it played by as many people as possible.

199
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:09,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

200
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does that do to the console itself?

201
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:19,022
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so the console isn't necessarily as important to buy than, say, a PlayStation console or something like that.

202
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:43,867
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing it's nice to have choice for what you can play if Sony would you know be a little bit more cross-platform with their games as well I mean that would be pretty cool I just think it's something to consider when you're looking at a new console down the road that you know if you don't get a Microsoft console it may not be the end of the world because their products are everywhere and eventually they may just

203
00:20:45,046 --> 00:21:01,396
[SPEAKER_00]: forget doing a console and just whatever we're just gonna this is an Xbox laptop now and you're just gonna play Xbox games on it along with everything else that you do because Xbox is part of Windows now and that's how it goes um

204
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.

205
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the whole console war thing is stupid.

206
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:15,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to explain that to my wife, you know, what the console wars were, because she was asking a question about something, like someone was comparing it to the console wars, and I had to explain to her what that was.

207
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:16,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's silly.

208
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:17,337
[SPEAKER_02]: You do...

209
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:24,584
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked about, you know, when you are stupid kids, you can get into console wars because that's what people do.

210
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:31,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with all due respect, you have children who are that perfect stupid kid age, although your children are very intelligent.

211
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:35,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they're at that age where if they were going to fight about something, consoles would be it.

212
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get into that at all?

213
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,015
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.

214
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:39,496
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.

215
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:41,017
[SPEAKER_00]: They play games wherever they want.

216
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:41,478
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got...

217
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:42,738
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more.

218
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:13,014
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure there are audiences out there of people that use those services that are like, well, ha, Netflix got that and Hulu doesn't.

219
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:14,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares, dude.

220
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:15,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares.

221
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:18,481
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a silly thing to...

222
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:19,322
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

223
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:19,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

224
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:49,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Well on that note, let's move into the types of games that we were rooting for this week in our gaming week and talk a little bit about how was your gaming week.

225
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:53,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will go to DarkSakura if you'd like to share anything that you were playing in your gaming week.

226
00:22:54,733 --> 00:23:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I restarted Dragon Age Veilguard so I could sort of do a continuation of my very first Inquisition game and so far you know how like you have those games you've got dating options you'd be like wow I'm gonna date so-and-so they look cool I have not felt that way yet about anybody except I just got Davran and he's kind of cool so maybe maybe it'll be him

227
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:47,648
[SPEAKER_04]: um there's things that I like but the writing is a bit just the writing is not as good as what I would expect the games to have um but I'm a side quest person I love to look at the scenery I love lore I love all of that type of stuff and so I'm kind of giving it the Xanadu treatment I love all of the parts of it the whole thing may not be great but

228
00:23:48,408 --> 00:24:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm totally enjoying all of the parts of it you know in my digestible chunks I have to say with Dragon Age Veilguard since you brought it up with the companions now granted I'm still early on so there's a lot of probably nuance and things I haven't you did get it yeah I did get it and I played like maybe three hours of it oh yeah you weren't here last week so I couldn't tell you about it so I did play a little bit about it a little bit of it just a little bit um but I can say I'm completely

229
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:27,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I have hearts in my eyes for one of the characters and it's it's a weird thing because I'm not used to like wanting I'm just gonna keep it real I'm not used to wanting to have a heterosexual relationship in these games but like I love her go ahead and say is it Neve?

230
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:39,687
[SPEAKER_04]: you already know you already know it's Neve Neve is awesome but she wasn't the kind that I go for she's like the Miranda to me okay no I love her I love her in her hat

231
00:24:41,162 --> 00:25:10,302
[SPEAKER_04]: her little fascinator yes I did though get some armor for her that I like a lot better than her default outfit okay I'll see I need to I need to make myself play more hashtag do it for now I'll do some screenshots but I was gonna go after Harding at first but she's just like been a friend always there you know so and I still I something got a little spoiled for me so I'm gonna let that happen because I think it's cute um but uh

232
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:33,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, usually I'm like not into the Grey Warden character or anything but Daverin's kind of cool and he comes with a griffin so what's not to love but which actually I love it too because there's so much of the apocrypha that goes into it like the comics and early stories and old legends and things and I like that they're bringing that in I just wish they were doing it

233
00:25:34,302 --> 00:26:02,750
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more well everything you know of from the other games is wrong let's not ever mention the hero of Ferelden oh look though Dorian has aged nicely anyway I love him I'm glad that they included I'm just going to go ahead and say it they put Mevaris from the comics in there and I freaking love Mevaris from Those Who Sleep and all those if you want to read those comics I will lend them to you she is a delight um

234
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:28,264
[SPEAKER_04]: and if I am correct she is the second transgender character in the Dragon Age franchise after Crem so I will say however there's something that really irked me with it and I'm glad to have good well I'm happy to have transgender representation but there's a few things that seem

235
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:44,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say anachronistic, you know, but things that don't make sense within the established medicine and technologies within the series, right?

236
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:50,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It is cool, though, for personal representation, you can have your surgery scars, you know, for top surgery.

237
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:53,773
[SPEAKER_04]: But they go really heavy handed.

238
00:26:54,533 --> 00:27:03,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was listening to some reviews by some trans streamers who were saying that, yeah, these are never the words that I would have used for myself.

239
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:07,520
[SPEAKER_04]: These were words that were made up by a non-trans person.

240
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:13,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to remember that same criticism in Andromeda, and they ended up going back and fixing it as part of it.

241
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:38,824
[SPEAKER_04]: that was with the dead naming yeah yeah it was a little more severe in that case but yeah I just I like I'm just I'm feeling like echoes back to that you know but they had but Maevaris I think dead named herself once or someone did interesting and so if if you respect somebody who who has transitioned don't bring up their dead name

242
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:57,634
[SPEAKER_04]: you know maybe they want to for some reason like hey you knew me before you know meeting like an old classmate or something oh yeah you knew me as this this is me now you know I can understand that but not just telling oh random stranger who has no idea who I ever was you know in a past life or anything I don't think that's cool

243
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:27,792
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's up to the person anyway so there are so far it's really heavy handed I think and not in a good way and I'm kind of afraid about what's going to happen when we get when I get Tosh because that's a little bit more that was spoiled for me but I'm not going to go into full detail on that one I'll let whoever plays it know but

244
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:41,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I... That was a cringe moment for me because I actually had to go back and replay those scenes so that I would just stick with how my character is, right?

245
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:42,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

246
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:47,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, though, a good portion of the dialogue.

247
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:52,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, right now, I've had Balaras and Harding in my party.

248
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:58,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually get along so well and tease each other.

249
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:08,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they go over, since Balaras is like a tinkerer of ancient technology, and Harding goes through her thing.

250
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, not spoiling.

251
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have a discussion about where their cultures intermix.

252
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:25,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Like words that were borrowed from one language versus another and different pieces of their own cultural lore that actually have common roots.

253
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, to me, I love stuff like that.

254
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:32,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I love ancient sociology.

255
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I love, you know, I guess...

256
00:29:38,180 --> 00:30:04,263
[SPEAKER_04]: like constructed sociology too you know stuff like that it just makes me really really happy and it immerses me in the universe those are the things that i enjoy um so um of course um i did play a little dead by daylight i tried to stream on tuesday but i had even less voice than i do now this is what i sound like by the way when i lead my uh my team meetings

257
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:32,757
[SPEAKER_04]: so I usually like okay somebody else talk for a minute so I played for about four games I made it through and Shay and Ryan joined me and Smokey at the end for some but by the time I got there I was like I'm so glad they talk all this much but I couldn't make myself heard to say hey killer's over here or this is who the killer is you know because by that point I was sounding like this

258
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:39,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is honestly more voices than I've had in a while, but as you can tell, it wears out.

259
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:46,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drinking very hot coffee mixed with Junior Mint hot chocolate.

260
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:47,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Delightful.

261
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really warm on my throat.

262
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:51,970
[SPEAKER_04]: But back to the Dead by Daylight.

263
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play some more tonight because I want to get through the tome for 2v8.

264
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:18,858
[SPEAKER_04]: um I didn't get well I got through everything for the haunted whatever but I forgot to go back and get the other two killer weapons so my bad um but I'm gonna try to get everything done even if I have to play offline um and

265
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:24,360
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may mention, I am going to be playing a lot of Dead by Daylight on the 29th.

266
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have to stand in line for that TV.

267
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hang out with me instead.

268
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't everybody shop online these days now?

269
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:36,444
[SPEAKER_04]: The smart people do.

270
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,364
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

271
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:43,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But at any rate, and yeah, I was also still playing Suika and

272
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:50,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I played something else, but my brain is broken.

273
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:53,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I played sleeping a lot.

274
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,596
[SPEAKER_04]: The sleeping game was great.

275
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah.

276
00:31:58,738 --> 00:31:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

277
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on.

278
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:01,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about Loki.

279
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,640
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

280
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:05,302
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just all Minecraft stuff.

281
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:12,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on Channel 64 content, so I had to make a ton of custom models this week.

282
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:13,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like 110 of them.

283
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:13,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh,

284
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:32,869
[SPEAKER_00]: just working on new park stuff I've got a new fishing minigame that is going to be in the next episode and then this whole redemption thing that essentially you earn tickets by going to the attractions and then you can redeem those tickets for

285
00:32:33,590 --> 00:33:02,101
[SPEAKER_00]: random plushies and then of course like any midway you can trade three small plushies for a larger plushie and so I have to build the systems and do all that so I've been like toiling away with custom redstone so I finally got the filter system to make it idiot proof so that you can't break it that was tricky but this starts my two weeks of working on Minecraft content all

286
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:27,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken the rest of the month off so I'm gonna try to get the big water ride done excited for you jealous of your big break I uh I should have thought ahead and took a little break too uh just so I can work on some creative projects and just you know um rest you know yeah yeah no I'm excited for your uh creative projects and getting that done it's great yeah it'll be fun all right

287
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:50,998
[SPEAKER_02]: my gaming week so um been playing more Diablo 4 I finished the battle pass so not just not just the season journey but the battle pass so there's nothing more I can do in season six unless I just want to grind my character to higher levels which I think I am I am a-okay putting it on the back burner for a little bit outside of I may create a few more videos for my YouTube channel because those videos are actually performing better than my classic lookbacks so hey

288
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:57,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get those cheap likes and subscribes wherever I can get them, as long as it's in my wheelhouse.

289
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to invalidate my morals to do it, but I do love Diablo 4.

290
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:06,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't, you know, I don't see myself playing this particular season a heck of a lot more now that I've kind of hit that point.

291
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of get to put that on the back burner until January.

292
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:13,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV, on the other hand, got a patch this week with some new content.

293
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:14,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been enjoying that.

294
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,468
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Final Fantasy XI inspired raid.

295
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard about this.

296
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:19,729
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

297
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:36,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to playing that.

298
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done the new dungeon, which is a very different thing.

299
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:42,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more in line with the Dawn Trail story and everything.

300
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: The new dungeon actually had some really good mechanics.

301
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:49,749
[SPEAKER_02]: The last boss mechanics, I'm actually really like, oh, this is awesome that...

302
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there were some things where I was like, oh, they just did the same thing that they did in the Ruby Weapon Raid.

303
00:34:55,992 --> 00:35:08,620
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other parts of it where I'm like, oh, they really, really want to make arenas different shapes and do different things with them than your standard, like, MMO, go in the room, and it's a circle, and the boss is just standing at you.

304
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:12,363
[SPEAKER_02]: They did something very different, and I thought I liked it.

305
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, good times.

306
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:15,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

307
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:27,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games I've been playing this week, I got to check out, I mentioned earlier in the show, I was gaming at a friend's last night who has a lot of gaming system, invests in a lot of stuff, and had a PlayStation 5 Pro.

308
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was actually showing off, I say showing off, but just kind of so we could get a taste of it.

309
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not every game...

310
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:43,981
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of tuned up for the PlayStation 5 Pro, although he was saying that some games that ran sluggish on PlayStation 5, he mentioned Forspoken specifically.

311
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:46,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you remember that one from Square Enix kind of early on.

312
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:51,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get a lot of traction because I think some people said it was buggy and stuff.

313
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:55,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it plays much better on PlayStation 5 Pro, even though they didn't

314
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:56,652
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:34,481
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like you're getting your 4k performance mode but in 60 frames that's you know and technically there was an even higher performance mode that was still 30 frames but he said no 60 frames only and I tend to agree I'm always like 60 frames only no no if the game can do 60 frames do it

316
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:40,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So he showed that and a little bit of Final Fantasy Rebirth so we could kind of see what it looks like.

317
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:52,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, especially, especially, I was just really stricken with the color, the way Aloy's face looked and her companion early on in the game, the gentleman's name, I don't remember, sorry.

318
00:36:53,156 --> 00:36:56,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way they looked, like their faces were just...

319
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:58,260
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

320
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: to get this same type of graphic performance.

321
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:24,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if that type of stuff is important to you and you want the latest and greatest, it's going to make it pretty, I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money.

322
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:32,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the upgrades are worth it to me, but once I saw it, I was like, okay, yeah, that does look really good.

323
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:37,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also know I game usually on my computer monitor here in my office.

324
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:44,170
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a big, big TV, and I feel like a lot of those things sort of make way for the changes as well.

325
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:50,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Ranma says there's better ROI on PC parts than a pro console.

326
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:51,675
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

327
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:54,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people just have to make the choice that makes them happy.

328
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:56,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what makes sense for their household.

329
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are a big console gamer, which some people are, this is of interest to you.

330
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:03,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this.

331
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,244
[SPEAKER_02]: This friend of mine is really big in VR.

332
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:08,885
[SPEAKER_02]: He really loves VR stuff too.

333
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:13,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the other game we checked out a little bit was No Man's Sky.

334
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:15,309
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

335
00:38:38,464 --> 00:39:06,632
[SPEAKER_02]: but they played it in VR I never got around to playing it in the PSVR too because I got pulled into a game of Big Brain Academy on the Switch so I didn't get to get around to see VR but they were just raving about it they were like this looks so fucking good oh my god like they were just like super like yeah they were really into it so I'm like okay well I guess maybe that I do maybe next time I go over there I need to be like hey I didn't get to see No Man's Sky last time I want to see that so um

336
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bobby said, I still hate the VR controls, No Man's Sky.

337
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:11,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed they were doing all this.

338
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:15,714
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, you got to reach behind your back to get the multi-tool and you got to do all this.

339
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, they were like, how do you do this?

340
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:17,975
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do this?

341
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting there going, I literally don't know.

342
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:24,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to do this in VR because they changed all the fucking controls.

343
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what to tell you.

344
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:26,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

345
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:33,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, because I was doing it when they were playing on 2D and flat screen before they hooked up the VR.

346
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh yeah, hit this button, hit this button, go to this menu, you know, because I've played a lot of that game, but couldn't tell you a lick of it in VR.

347
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:41,454
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

348
00:39:43,086 --> 00:39:45,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get to another game I played this week because this was a pretty big deal.

349
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:58,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also played the game Tetris Forever, which is the latest entry in the Gold Master series, which is essentially trying to be the Criterion Collection of Blu-rays, but this is, you know, for video games.

350
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:05,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Gold Master series done by Digital Eclipse, which Atari 50 was sort of zero in that series.

351
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:08,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't officially Gold Master, but let's be real, Atari 50 kind of led to that.

352
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they had Karateka

353
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:13,298
[SPEAKER_02]: The Making of Karateka, I think, was the first one.

354
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,279
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the Jeff Minter story, which was the second one.

355
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have Tetris Forever, which is the third one.

356
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:19,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

357
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:22,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to say out the gate, I'm really happy this series exists.

358
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: As a fan of classic gaming, I just really love how this is put together as a documentary, as something that you can move through and really take a good look at prototypes and even manuals that were in Japanese.

359
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to the extent where I was like, okay...

360
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the back of the box in Japanese the way they were selling this game in Japan.

361
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:47,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring up my Google Translate lens and see what did this actually say?

362
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:48,837
[SPEAKER_02]: How were they saying it?

363
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:51,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the cartoons were really funny and some of the things they were saying.

364
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:56,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is just so neat to be able to explore this.

365
00:40:56,102 --> 00:41:03,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like finding your old magazine collection but going a step deeper with all the interactive components.

366
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:07,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy this series exists and I want to see it be successful and that's why I'm willing to

367
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

368
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:32,496
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

369
00:41:50,638 --> 00:42:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not like somebody can build an electronica 60 emulator they had to go back and basically simulate it's more of a simulation but it's really well done uh it makes you feel like you're playing the old terminal you know it feels like an old terminal game and gives you a sense of playing the original original tetris uh in that um

370
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:13,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to also say, I never saw the Tetris movie.

371
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw the movie that they did for the Apple films and the movie that they put out.

372
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:24,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just kind of like, oh, Tetris is like a story about business?

373
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:29,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's probably all blown out of proportion for Hollywood, whatever.

374
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:31,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And that probably still is the case.

375
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:32,874
[SPEAKER_02]: However...

376
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:36,345
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

377
00:42:53,843 --> 00:43:09,132
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just really enjoyed that trip and that information and getting to hear the story about how Hank went to Russia and he had no plan on how he was going to do it.

378
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:10,873
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't even know where he was going to go.

379
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:21,780
[SPEAKER_02]: To hear him tell it himself and then like, you know, Alexei, the creator of Tetris was there in that too and they talk about meeting in the room for the first time and all this stuff.

380
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was...

381
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,161
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

382
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:48,675
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

383
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:08,614
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

384
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:24,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, yeah, really neat.

385
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:27,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the last chapter, they talk about Tetris Effect.

386
00:44:27,928 --> 00:44:29,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetsuya Mizuguchi is in the game.

387
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,973
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not a huge part of it, but, you know, he talks about it.

388
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:44,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they talk about, at the end, the very last sort of blip on the timeline is the kid who crashed Tetris last year.

389
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:47,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, at the end of the year, like, he crashed Tetris.

390
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:48,526
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like 13 years old.

391
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:48,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

392
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:51,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the kill screen on Tetris, basically.

393
00:44:51,748 --> 00:45:00,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends with that as sort of a way of saying this game is still relevant, is still a piece of history today.

394
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:15,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, some of the things where I was a little bit like, oh, this isn't... And Bobby says the movie plays up more life and death stuff that didn't exist, but the guts of the story is accurate.

395
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:20,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because he sort of brushes, he says, I wasn't really supposed to be there.

396
00:45:20,578 --> 00:45:23,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody had caught that I was there, I probably would have lost my visa.

397
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,021
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks about those types of things.

398
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:34,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see how in a movie, they probably really played up that whole, oh, he was in danger, you know, the type of thing that probably, at least hearing it from his mouth, didn't seem to be as big of a deal.

399
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:44,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, they talk a lot because that whole story, that entire thing is all around that Game Boy release of the game.

400
00:45:45,768 --> 00:46:01,845
[SPEAKER_02]: and the quote I loved the most out of the entire thing and it's even on the splash screen when you boot the game and just really kind of showed the power and like why he was so dead set on getting the rights to the portable version of Tetris basically to put out the version on the Game Boy.

401
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:07,129
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to Nintendo and he told Nintendo, and I'm paraphrasing here.

402
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:09,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I don't have the actual quote in front of me.

403
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:13,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, originally the Game Boy was going to have Super Mario Land as the pack-in game.

404
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,254
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what they were planning to do, which makes sense, right?

405
00:46:16,294 --> 00:46:17,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario game is pack-in game.

406
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:18,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Worked for them before.

407
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:25,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But he went to them and he said, if you want boys to play the Game Boy, pack in Mario.

408
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,002
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want everybody to play the Game Boy, pack in Tetris.

409
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:34,411
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

410
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:57,812
[SPEAKER_02]: and they really show that personal touch to how it's really impacted the culture there.

411
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:00,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby says that moment is in the movie too.

412
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can't be surprised about that because it is a really powerful quote that I think shows why they were so dead set on getting the portable rights.

413
00:47:07,656 --> 00:47:17,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it really breaks down the whole because they got the portable rights then that led to the discussion about well they should be able to get the console rights but yes this other organization and I sort of knew about this stuff where

414
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:47,162
[SPEAKER_02]: another organization had the computer rights and they were taking computer to mean console as well and then there was a whole to-do in court about that and it does get into some of that and so it talks about Tengen Tetris it doesn't shy away from the fact that Atari and you even have people talking and they talk pretty respectfully about the Atari situation and they say we don't think that the guy and I forget his name in this that sold them the rights we don't think

415
00:47:47,822 --> 00:47:49,403
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

416
00:48:09,015 --> 00:48:10,816
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing was very fascinating to me.

417
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:13,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Not knowing a lot about how that all went down.

418
00:48:13,877 --> 00:48:18,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew about, yeah, it all hinged on they had the computer rights and the interpretation of what is a computer.

419
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:20,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's what it came down to.

420
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:24,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I didn't know, I will fully admit, I did not realize this.

421
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not realize Japan never got the NES version of Tetris we had.

422
00:48:30,362 --> 00:48:34,623
[SPEAKER_02]: That was specifically for non-Japan territories, including the US and Europe.

423
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:36,990
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

424
00:48:54,716 --> 00:49:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's not there is the NES version of Tetris, the Game Boy version of Tetris, the Tengen version of Tetris, and all of these other versions of the game that they spend a lot of time talking about in the documentary.

425
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:19,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look, I understand, like, it's a rights issue, Nintendo's doing their own thing, because Nintendo was the one to announce this whole thing originally in their direct, and they said, by the way...

426
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:19,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Tengen Tengen

427
00:49:39,620 --> 00:50:07,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari owns Digital Eclipse why but clearly at some point those rights probably reverted elsewhere and that probably has to do with the way Midway worked and where a lot of those so I'm not it is what it is it's tied up legally and so those versions of the game just can't be in there but it is it is a loss that I kind of feel because I'm just going to be honest the original version of Tetris is cool getting to play the PC Tetris is cool but

428
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff like Hatress, Bastress, Weltress.

429
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And they talk about it.

430
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:22,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They devote a little section as to where these sequels came from and why and how they were trying to expand on the puzzle phenomenon and the marketing and everything.

431
00:50:22,517 --> 00:50:23,157
[SPEAKER_02]: They just...

432
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:26,690
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

433
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:49,203
[SPEAKER_02]: because an orange right says Tengen Tetris got airbrushed out.

434
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:49,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they do.

435
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: They talk about it.

436
00:50:51,766 --> 00:50:52,127
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.

437
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a secret in this game.

438
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:54,610
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't talk around it.

439
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:56,172
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's here.

440
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:56,913
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happened.

441
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:58,696
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why there was, you know, and they get into it.

442
00:50:59,276 --> 00:50:59,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't play it.

443
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:14,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, recognizing that you're not going to get every version of Tetris, but you are going to get some of the key things throughout Tetris' history, as well as some other sideshow stuff, you know, like Tetris 2, Bomb Bliss.

444
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:15,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Bomb Bliss is terrible.

445
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:16,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there Toaster Tetris?

446
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:17,910
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Toaster Tetris.

447
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:18,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomb Bliss is in there.

448
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Bomb Bliss is terrible, to be quite honest.

449
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:25,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just, I think Bomb Bliss just kind of reeks as of how do we make Lightning Strike twice.

450
00:51:25,674 --> 00:51:26,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetranet?

451
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,017
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Tetranet isn't in there.

452
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:32,261
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tetris Time Warp is okay.

453
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:33,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

454
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:36,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the digital clips try to do something new.

455
00:51:36,406 --> 00:51:37,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super cute.

456
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:38,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say it.

457
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

458
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:43,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, right now, the definitive version of Tetris is Tetris Effect.

459
00:51:44,585 --> 00:51:53,708
[SPEAKER_02]: which the game doesn't also... It also does not show... Tetsuya Mizuguchi is in the game talking about it, you know, but like... I'm still gonna go for the Grandmaster.

460
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:54,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

461
00:51:55,309 --> 00:52:00,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris Grandmaster is not in there because it's an arcade series, but Tetris...

462
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:05,453
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big ports is in there.

463
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:10,756
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's hard for me at some point to remember what all is and isn't in there because they do talk about it.

464
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:22,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, sorry, I've gone on way too long on this one game, but I do just want to say from a museum walkthrough perspective and how they have crafted this documentary, I think they did a fantastic job.

465
00:52:23,402 --> 00:52:26,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they really just laid out what it is.

466
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,264
[SPEAKER_02]: From a...

467
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: get your hands and play all of these games that are on display in this gallery it's mostly there but there's definitely some holes in there that need to be filled in but to the Tetris company's benefit they probably would love if you playing this game made you go get a copy of Tetris Effect which is on sale right now because they're going to get two sales out of that and that's

468
00:52:52,372 --> 00:52:52,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

469
00:52:53,393 --> 00:52:55,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, kudos to the Gold Master Series.

470
00:52:55,914 --> 00:52:58,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't wait to see what's next out of that.

471
00:53:00,117 --> 00:53:02,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the museum stuff and the educational.

472
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:03,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot.

473
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not sitting here going, oh, I knew everything about Tetris.

474
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly didn't.

475
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:13,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But just kind of getting walked through and everything, I was like, okay, a lot of this makes so much sense.

476
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:14,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes so much sense now.

477
00:53:14,647 --> 00:53:15,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

478
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:43,217
[SPEAKER_02]: one more thing I will close on because I thought that this was like one of the oh yeah I'm with Justin Mango in chat who says Tetris DS I love that version so much again they acknowledge it in the timeline but you can't play it in the archive but that would just be too many versions of Tetris there is one version of Tetris I noticed wasn't there it's the Jaleco version of Tetris that was on the original PlayStation which was fucking terrible they don't acknowledge it at all

479
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to make a game so simple.

480
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:47,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible.

481
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:52,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bad because they added the whole thing about the archaeologist that was walking along the top.

482
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:55,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they added shit that didn't need to be there.

483
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:56,560
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it was terrible.

484
00:53:57,745 --> 00:53:59,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but Tetris DS was great.

485
00:53:59,646 --> 00:53:59,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

486
00:54:00,366 --> 00:54:01,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not in there, of course.

487
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:13,012
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I will say again, one of the documentary footage I found the most interesting was they have some rare footage, you know, because they Hank apparently loved to shoot movies because he had a lot of stuff on film.

488
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:16,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only his stuff in Russia is really fascinating, the stuff that he did shoot there.

489
00:54:17,594 --> 00:54:45,112
[SPEAKER_02]: but he actually shows when Alexei came to the US and actually demoed his game for the people that were gonna make I think the Nintendo version of the game they actually show him like walking through the game and like talking about some of the design elements of his game and why the score was the way it was a certain way and all that stuff and I just thought those are the types of nuggets that we need to preserve

490
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:51,072
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's where a lot of great games were born in the room talking to those people.

491
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:58,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad they got these extensive interview footage with Alexei and Hank and all these people that were instrumental to it.

492
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Just great to have that.

493
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would encourage you to pick it up.

494
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:07,099
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a fan of Tetris and it's hard to go wrong with that game, pick it up, add it to your collection.

495
00:55:07,499 --> 00:55:13,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a worthy... I see this as the criterion collection of games.

496
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:22,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to own these because it really is the complete package that really helps you understand not just the game itself, but how the game was created.

497
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,861
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, is the stuff about the Game Boy prototype and the story true?

498
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:29,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that's referring to, unfortunately.

499
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:31,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's a subplot in the movie or something.

500
00:55:32,783 --> 00:55:36,124
[SPEAKER_02]: They talk about how he fixed...

501
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:45,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo apologized to Alexei, the creator of Tetris, for a bug that existed in the Game Boy version of the game.

502
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:47,416
[SPEAKER_02]: That part was in the documentary.

503
00:55:47,436 --> 00:55:48,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's what it's referring to.

504
00:55:50,857 --> 00:55:56,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, SJ100Matt says, I wish Nintendo would let someone like Digital Eclipse do something like this with Miyamoto.

505
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:58,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Matt.

506
00:55:58,867 --> 00:55:59,727
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be amazing.

507
00:55:59,948 --> 00:56:01,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

508
00:56:01,148 --> 00:56:04,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about a wish list thing.

509
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:07,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think what Nintendo game

510
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:31,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like something like Balloon Fight I think would be great but it sucks because Iwata is no longer here right and so it's like we need we need to be making the literally we need to be making these things yesterday and if Nintendo doesn't want to partner with Digital Eclipse because they're Atari now then fine I wish Nintendo would look to this for a model about how to possibly preserve some of their own games so

511
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:39,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, I've talked way too much about that product, but you know I love me a classic game, and yeah, I had to talk about that.

512
00:56:39,153 --> 00:56:41,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's get back into some gaming news.

513
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:44,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Loki and talk about what is going on in the gaming world.

514
00:56:44,675 --> 00:56:51,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just quickly mention, I will not be here on December 15th.

515
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:54,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be no show that weekend, December 15th.

516
00:56:54,939 --> 00:56:56,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just fair warning.

517
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on to some more stories.

518
00:57:02,102 --> 00:57:02,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

519
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything old is new again.

520
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, remember the crew?

521
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:08,201
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about it again.

522
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:25,946
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the whole back and forth with, you know, the movement to try to get laws put on the books to prevent, you know, online games from being taken offline and essentially giving you... revoking your access to a piece of product that you...

523
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:29,027
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased, you know, in quotes.

524
00:57:30,168 --> 00:57:37,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a few people from California filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft regarding the crew being taken offline.

525
00:57:38,312 --> 00:57:50,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And they filed in federal court claiming that Ubisoft has duped its consumers by telling them they are buying the game when in reality they're renting a limited license.

526
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:54,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

527
00:57:56,053 --> 00:58:24,416
[SPEAKER_00]: yes but it's also EULA so I'm curious to see how that works out and then of course they gave a comparison explaining what it's like with the servers being taken down like imagine you buy a pinball machine and then a year later the company that sold that to you removed the bumpers and the flippers and the monitor displayed your score and all that stuff so it's like you still have it but not usable um

528
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:51,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, along with that, we're reminded that also, I think we talked about this last week, how there is a law that went through in California talking about where basically these companies are going to have to explain if you click buy or purchase, if you're purchasing a game or purchasing a license for said thing, it's going to be more clear.

529
00:58:52,406 --> 00:59:13,648
[SPEAKER_00]: with that, but I don't know if they're, I don't think anything's gonna come of this lawsuit, honestly, because with the EULAs and all that, they try to kind of legally weasel their way out of there, but I do agree that, you know, the idea of purchasing the game meaning you can play stuff is very contentious when it comes to online, these

530
00:59:14,449 --> 00:59:26,450
[SPEAKER_00]: always online services that also aren't always online because eventually they shut them down when they're not profitable anymore so that kind of sucks for these live service games but I don't know, vote with your wallet

531
00:59:27,862 --> 00:59:28,582
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we can do.

532
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:34,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I more see this story this week as a, we knew this was coming.

533
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute they pulled this down and we saw that consumer advocacy groups were starting to kind of coalesce around this.

534
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, the question was asked, when's the lawsuit coming?

535
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:51,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this isn't a clip from OLR I'm going to go back and play because everybody asked this question.

536
00:59:51,773 --> 00:59:53,094
[SPEAKER_02]: When's the lawsuit coming?

537
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:55,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, here it is.

538
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:56,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out this week.

539
00:59:56,435 --> 01:00:03,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, again, not to belittle the story because I think this is going to lead to bigger things.

540
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:07,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a lot of people who are kind of like, I want to see this play out in court.

541
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Popcorn.gif.

542
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:10,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens.

543
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:15,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think it will though because – I mean it may, but I don't think that –

544
01:00:15,763 --> 01:00:19,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything's going to come of it because they're going to be like, it was disclaimed.

545
01:00:20,406 --> 01:00:22,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess, no, that kind of makes sense, though.

546
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you think about it, it makes sense.

547
01:00:25,148 --> 01:00:36,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what verbiage is on the box, but like, assuming that you're a consumer purchasing the game physically, let's say that, physically, and...

548
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:43,765
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you're purchasing it out of store, you're not going to be aware of what's in that EULA.

549
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:49,251
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can you agree to that EULA prior to seeing it when you purchase a game?

550
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,053
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I kind of think EULA's kind of broken down.

551
01:00:51,073 --> 01:00:53,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you better go join the legal team because you make a pretty good argument.

552
01:00:53,335 --> 01:00:53,596
Yeah.

553
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:58,438
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, because it kind of breaks down, unless it's actually written on the box.

554
01:00:58,478 --> 01:01:01,659
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, it's all the fine print on a box.

555
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,460
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not signing that.

556
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

557
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: For what it's worth, Loki, I do tend to side with you that it is going to get shot down because this lawsuit is being filed in the U.S.,

558
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:16,936
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

559
01:01:35,814 --> 01:01:49,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Britain, you know, and I would bet that they're very oftentimes stronger advocacy laws, especially like France, you know, and I would be very curious to see how this would play out in a court over there.

560
01:01:49,564 --> 01:01:56,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, they kind of tried that with the change in laws or trying to do that where they said that they're not technically...

561
01:01:58,663 --> 01:02:26,430
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fine that they do that I think when they were pursuing all that stuff so maybe I don't know if it's in California well I think it is in California so maybe I mean I don't know it's certainly not going to apply to that law that is on the books now or going to be on the books here very soon because this game came out in I think 2014 it's been a while so and I mean and to be fair like

562
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:29,872
[SPEAKER_00]: The newer crew games now are going to have an offline patch.

563
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:32,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, they're going to have an offline patch.

564
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:32,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

565
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,536
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supposedly in the works.

566
01:02:34,636 --> 01:02:35,296
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see it.

567
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That was damage control.

568
01:02:37,878 --> 01:02:38,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

569
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:38,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

570
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

571
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:54,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on a somewhat related note, let's talk about, you know, the preservation of games and how people are starting to kind of, I guess, make an opportunity out of this whole thing with preserving games.

572
01:02:54,972 --> 01:03:01,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has to do with GOG, which of course is, I still, I didn't know it never meant good old games.

573
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:05,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know at some point they were just GOG, but GOG started as good old games.

574
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only time I've ever bought games from them was because I wanted old shit.

575
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted like, what did I buy on there?

576
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:14,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Sid Meier's Covert Action is on there.

577
01:03:15,123 --> 01:03:16,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a lot of Sid Meier games on there.

578
01:03:16,904 --> 01:03:26,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Colonization from the early one, not the Civ IV version, but the early, early Colonization is also on the store and I need to get that at some point.

579
01:03:27,027 --> 01:03:30,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But whenever I've bought games on that storefront, it's because it is a old game.

580
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:33,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do want to be able to play on a modern machine.

581
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:37,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that was sort of that store's niche for a long time.

582
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:52,443
[SPEAKER_02]: and now they're going back and they have made a big old push this week called the GOG Preservation Program and they're calling it a determination to return to the roots of the company with a long-term commitment to preserve and maintain classic games for the foreseeable future.

583
01:03:53,244 --> 01:04:02,312
[SPEAKER_02]: On this list there are 100 games and the company is pledging to use its own resources to maintain the game's compatibility with modern systems and future systems.

584
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:08,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we could talk about some of the games that are on this list and so forth.

585
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:09,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say this.

586
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:17,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's nice that we have this sort of thing out there in this effort to preserve the old games.

587
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:24,380
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, I can't help but feel this is a little opportunistic of GOG for the moment.

588
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: which I understand this is you got to make that money yay capitalism I say unenthusiastically this is how the world works you got to find that marketing thing where you can and you know I think GOG here is seeing an opportunity where gamers are up an arm about the lack of preservation and they have an opportunity to say hey we do preservation

589
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already been doing it for quite some time.

590
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:54,575
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what our company was founded on.

591
01:04:54,895 --> 01:05:03,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to put a nice shiny coat of paint and write up a new mission statement and goal and vision for this.

592
01:05:03,504 --> 01:05:06,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to put it out there as our plan and our commitment to saving games.

593
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:20,630
[SPEAKER_02]: so this whole thing I don't see what the news is in this to be quite honest beyond GOG launches new marketing campaign to let you know they exist

594
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:22,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's working, P.S.

595
01:05:22,848 --> 01:05:24,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people are writing with this story this week.

596
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:26,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not being shady.

597
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:31,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I have bought things off of the service for exactly this reason.

598
01:05:31,592 --> 01:05:33,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to play them in the future.

599
01:05:33,652 --> 01:05:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying this feels a little bit like, you know, the bail bondsman advertisements outside the courthouse.

600
01:05:45,098 --> 01:05:48,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking an opportunity in the situation.

601
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:53,547
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says, so are you calling BS or are you not buying this?

602
01:05:53,627 --> 01:05:54,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying what?

603
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:58,089
[SPEAKER_02]: They're committing to what they've always been doing, as far as I'm aware.

604
01:05:58,529 --> 01:06:00,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, is there something new in this that I'm missing?

605
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:10,293
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they've always been, I remember a few years ago, they put Diablo 1 on the service for 10 bucks and I believe it's still there.

606
01:06:10,693 --> 01:06:14,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it's on the list of the 100 games, is the original Diablo.

607
01:06:14,794 --> 01:06:18,758
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a big deal because it was like, well, why isn't Battle.net doing this?

608
01:06:18,778 --> 01:06:22,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But for whatever reason, GOG has it on their platform and they did a fine job.

609
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:28,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby says they're doing the tech support instead of the original publisher.

610
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:33,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And haven't they always kind of had to do that to make the games run on their system?

611
01:06:34,592 --> 01:06:44,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if that is the news that they are saying, we're dedicating XYZ employees to patching up these old games to make them work, then cool, I guess, but...

612
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:53,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying it feels a little bit like they see a movement and they're taking advantage of the movement, which is what capitalists do.

613
01:06:54,366 --> 01:06:58,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying they're like, oh my God, this is a completely unethical, horrible company.

614
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I'm just saying it just seems to me that this is just a bunch of marketing language.

615
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:13,000
[SPEAKER_02]: But great, if they're making a commitment to make old games playable on all future hardware, I don't see how that's a bad thing.

616
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:18,503
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if the company ever goes under someday, this is all for naught, isn't it?

617
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:23,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So, is it really forever?

618
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:31,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you what is forever, and that is Half-Life 2.

619
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:34,477
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, that game is forever and ever and ever.

620
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:40,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And Half-Life 2 just celebrated its 20th anniversary this past week, which I can't fucking believe.

621
01:07:41,961 --> 01:07:46,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't, you know, is this game, is this show older than Half-Life 2?

622
01:07:47,183 --> 01:07:48,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is, isn't it?

623
01:07:48,644 --> 01:07:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're older than dirt.

624
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:51,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of a bitch.

625
01:07:51,587 --> 01:07:53,708
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Half-Life 2.

626
01:07:54,489 --> 01:07:56,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our show is older than some of our listeners.

627
01:07:57,271 --> 01:08:08,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this show, or this show, this game turned 20 years old this past week, and so they released Half-Life 2 Episode 3 in our hearts, in our minds, in our fantasies.

628
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:10,783
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they did not release that, but...

629
01:08:11,738 --> 01:08:39,932
[SPEAKER_02]: they did kind of zhuzh up the original game and they released alongside it a documentary and they talked in the documentary about why isn't there a third episode for Half-Life 2 and basically it boils down to a need to work on other Valve titles at the time because they went to go work on Left 4 Dead is where the team that was working on Half-Life 2 went and then by the time they were ready to go back to Episode 3 the argument was made that we missed it

630
01:08:40,552 --> 01:09:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: so basically like the opportunity had come and gone and you know one of the developers in the documentary says we could have gone back and spent two years to make episode three and this is where Gabe Newell chimes in and says my personal failure was being stumped I couldn't figure out why doing episode three was pushing anything forward

631
01:09:01,491 --> 01:09:04,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't figure out how to count to the number three.

632
01:09:17,455 --> 01:09:21,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, fans who have been waiting for the resolution to this story.

633
01:09:21,897 --> 01:09:23,518
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm being dramatic.

634
01:09:23,558 --> 01:09:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being mean.

635
01:09:24,418 --> 01:09:36,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, in all seriousness, when you are a creative person, if you're not feeling that creative motivation behind something,

636
01:09:37,184 --> 01:09:41,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they had all these concepts which show up in the documentary and all that stuff too, which is cool.

637
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:44,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess they weren't loving the ice gun and loving these things.

638
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:51,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And if creatively you're not really passionate about what it is you're making, then you don't really want to make it.

639
01:09:52,257 --> 01:10:00,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can respect that, but I'm also kind of like, damn, there's just a lot of people who are just left in the cold with this whole thing.

640
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:01,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And that part's kind of a bummer.

641
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:32,268
[SPEAKER_02]: um but if you want to check out Half-Life 2 they it is it is episode one episode two along with the base game available on Steam now there's uh Steam workshop support available and all that good stuff videos of the demos from E3 so it basically it's their own kind of criterion version if you will of Half-Life I mean you know we were just talking about how Digital Eclipse did their version and maybe Nintendo could do their own version someday well this in a way is Valve's version of this for Half-Life

642
01:10:32,668 --> 01:10:49,882
[SPEAKER_02]: with the documentary and all that other stuff so and then of course you know the whole thing ends with the like we'll never say never type of thing when it comes to Half-Life and now that you've asked about it it's gonna be another 20 years

643
01:10:53,133 --> 01:11:01,699
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have laughed if they have, you know how everyone always said with Valve time, anytime you mention a Half-Life 3 remake, it pushes it back this much time.

644
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:02,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

645
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:07,503
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be funny if in the documentary they show this elaborate computer system that's calculating that.

646
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,224
[SPEAKER_00]: The clock keeps going up.

647
01:11:09,284 --> 01:11:09,504
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like...

648
01:11:12,636 --> 01:11:15,377
[SPEAKER_00]: We told you, like, you just didn't listen.

649
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:18,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not coming out for another 2,000 years.

650
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:18,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

651
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:20,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Some comments in chat.

652
01:11:20,139 --> 01:11:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, I did buy it when it last went on sale.

653
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I imagine a lot of y'all probably picked up this game at some point.

654
01:11:25,822 --> 01:11:33,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check your Steam libraries and see if it got a big old update on the back end because it probably did, you know, with all this extra stuff.

655
01:11:33,325 --> 01:11:34,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out.

656
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:39,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Alan, my husband, loves Half-Life and usually revisits the old games once a year.

657
01:11:40,049 --> 01:11:41,551
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll do a complete playthrough of them.

658
01:11:41,871 --> 01:11:47,636
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to do mods and what was the whole Black Mesa, I think was like the reinvention of Part 1?

659
01:11:48,256 --> 01:11:49,837
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a new game too.

660
01:11:50,058 --> 01:11:52,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there like Blue Shift?

661
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,440
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be the new game.

662
01:11:54,821 --> 01:11:57,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an old, I think, mod for it?

663
01:11:57,864 --> 01:11:58,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe.

664
01:11:58,684 --> 01:12:03,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't too much into Half-Life when it first came out.

665
01:12:03,248 --> 01:12:05,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to write Half-Life 2 Episode 3?

666
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:46,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I could write a game and let somebody else do all the other work for me If I wrote Half-Life 2 Episode 3 it would look like the game that's playing behind Loki right now on stream No, that's creating the game I'm talking about writing the story for the game

667
01:12:47,799 --> 01:13:02,371
[SPEAKER_04]: because if I can sit down and write a 40 chapter supernatural fanfic that has over 2,000 to 3,000 words per chapter, I think I can write a video game synopsis and story.

668
01:13:02,752 --> 01:13:04,893
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair though, you're probably not the first.

669
01:13:05,054 --> 01:13:07,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet's a big place and I'm sure... Oh, I'm sure.

670
01:13:08,136 --> 01:13:10,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could write the proposal for me writing it for them.

671
01:13:11,809 --> 01:13:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeRite in chat brings up Blue Shift and Opposing Force, the two expansion packs to Half-Life 1.

672
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it all fits in.

673
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And then S2100Matt actually links us to this Steam store page for Project Borealis.

674
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:30,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of cool that all those sorts of fan projects do kind of get Valve's blessing in a way with that.

675
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that at least they aren't shutting down Nintendo.

676
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:57,709
[SPEAKER_02]: fan projects based on their old IP sorts of things I do appreciate that sometimes they hire the fan project people Nintendo I think Valve does a lot of good stuff there that maybe other companies in Washington should take notes who may actually be based in Japan but have major satellite offices across the street in Washington alright moving on Loki

677
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:01,490
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they doing in Irvine at Blizz headquarters?

678
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:07,229
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumors of what they may be doing.

679
01:14:08,329 --> 01:14:14,632
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, a job listing just spoiling all the things over.

680
01:14:15,732 --> 01:14:20,854
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a job listing for design director of innovation, which is extremely generic.

681
01:14:21,615 --> 01:14:29,798
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says you'll be the vision holder and owner over key strategic innovations on an upcoming open world shooter game.

682
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:33,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like they're working on an open world shooter game.

683
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:47,431
[SPEAKER_00]: There was rumors a while back that apparently the previous Far Cry 5 director Dan Hay was working at Blizzard and developing a title in the StarCraft universe, but we'll see.

684
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:48,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

685
01:14:48,672 --> 01:14:50,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Ghost coming back?

686
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we get the StarCraft Ghost finally?

687
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:53,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe?

688
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:54,998
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain's also like, wasn't

689
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:20,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Titan which bits and pieces of it became Overwatch wasn't Project Titan supposed to be an open world shooter kind of maybe I think it was I think it might have been a little bit different but like I know the the PvP and Overwatch was like one mode about when you were like contesting a zone or something and they ended up making that like the actual game is where Overwatch was kind of born out of Titan so uh story just like uh yeah like um

690
01:15:20,834 --> 01:15:22,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortnite, yeah.

691
01:15:23,055 --> 01:15:23,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of.

692
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:26,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Battle Royale, yeah.

693
01:15:26,296 --> 01:15:27,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

694
01:15:27,476 --> 01:15:32,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and a lot of people are responding to this going, why don't they just make a StarCraft 3?

695
01:15:33,638 --> 01:15:37,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are sort of responding with... Because they still haven't made a StarCraft 2.

696
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:41,880
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they did finish StarCraft 2, but they did it across four games.

697
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really StarCraft 2, though?

698
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:44,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

699
01:15:44,844 --> 01:16:13,008
[SPEAKER_02]: well you know and and some people are wondering is there space for an RTS again in uh you know the modern gaming world is there space for an RTS to be successful I I or is the market too niche for that sort of thing um I don't know I don't know the answer to that but I think it's disappointing I think they could I could they could do RTS stuff I mean I don't think there's like there's a lot of games that they say oh they're not gonna do well and stuff like look at even um

700
01:16:14,192 --> 01:16:17,333
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

701
01:16:34,337 --> 01:16:53,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand where no matter what they do if they were to make StarCraft 3 a pure RTS there are always going to be the people always who are loudly going to say this fucking sucks compared to the original why don't you just play the fucking original and that voice might be getting what they want

702
01:16:55,138 --> 01:16:55,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

703
01:16:55,758 --> 01:17:00,319
[SPEAKER_02]: The original and part two for what it's worth, those two games, that is all you're going to have.

704
01:17:00,759 --> 01:17:05,060
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go play those games, go play them because they're going to go a different direction with StarCraft.

705
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,661
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting to me.

706
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:18,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is all based on speculation anyway, but it does seem like StarCraft is the series we're sort of due to get an update on out of Blizzard because it's been a little while now.

707
01:17:18,983 --> 01:17:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: We sort of just assume, well, they got to be cooking up something in the StarCraft universe because...

708
01:17:22,824 --> 01:17:30,946
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they're trying to do something like Helldivers 2 but with the StarCraft universe or something like that?

709
01:17:31,886 --> 01:17:42,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, Blizzard just has to take... Blizzard is always really good at taking a popular, you know, computer party game type of thing and really streamlining it for a bigger crowd.

710
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:44,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's literally what World of Warcraft was.

711
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,510
[SPEAKER_02]: To some extent, that's what Diablo was.

712
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:48,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely what Overwatch was.

713
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:49,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's... Yeah.

714
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:50,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

715
01:17:51,485 --> 01:17:53,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, be interesting what happens with it.

716
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:57,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonds006 in chat says, LOL, you're calling me out on that, Rob.

717
01:17:57,987 --> 01:18:00,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave me alone with my StarCraft 1 and Brood Wars.

718
01:18:01,268 --> 01:18:06,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are a lot of people... StarCraft 3 will never be good enough for a lot of fans.

719
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe that's why they're just not going to make it.

720
01:18:09,191 --> 01:18:09,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You won.

721
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:10,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

722
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to... Congrats.

723
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:13,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the original forever.

724
01:18:13,592 --> 01:18:19,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did remaster the original at some point, which some people have opinions on, but...

725
01:18:20,174 --> 01:18:25,435
[SPEAKER_02]: it's there and I imagine that is what the future will be remasters of the first two games so

726
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, well, speaking of all of that, we also got Warcraft updates this week.

727
01:18:31,903 --> 01:18:44,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, I feel like with the amount of Blizzard-related updates this week, I felt like we got all the news this week that would have been released had there been a BlizzCon, but there wasn't this year.

728
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:47,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of got... Did anybody else notice?

729
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:50,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we got an awful lot of Blizzard news dumps this week out of the blue.

730
01:18:50,849 --> 01:18:51,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

731
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I felt like this was like the what would have been BlizzCon news.

732
01:18:56,371 --> 01:19:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it probably wasn't enough to justify an entire convention around it, which is why they went this direction.

733
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:04,175
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we got some updates on World of Warcraft.

734
01:19:04,195 --> 01:19:14,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I get to those, let me mention, because literally was just talking about RTS games and remasters, the original Warcraft and Warcraft 2 were fully remastered.

735
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are now available, were stealth dropped this week, so we didn't even know that Blizzard was working on these, they just released full on fucking remasters of Warcraft 1 and 2, done so they're out on Battle.net now if you want to check that out and if they knew that you had the old games because they were registered to your Battle.net account, congrats, you got the free upgrade, so you can play whatever yeah, that's the way to do it, that's pretty cool also, Warcraft 3 Reforged

736
01:19:45,262 --> 01:19:56,228
[SPEAKER_02]: was revisited to improve the visuals and I'm assuming some of the feedback because remember Warcraft 3 Reforged did not land quite as resoundingly as I think Blizzard was hoping.

737
01:19:56,669 --> 01:20:09,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, it came right at the wrong time for Blizzard when they were really in the thick of all of the issues they were dealing with internally and some of the worst of the worst stuff we saw in game development culture was happening there.

738
01:20:09,956 --> 01:20:11,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Warcraft 3 Reforged Warcraft 1, 2, and 3

739
01:20:24,773 --> 01:20:28,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Aziz updates to these different games going on there.

740
01:20:28,535 --> 01:20:44,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the other big, big news that came out of the Warcraft universe is that World of Warcraft did some minor updates talking about what's coming for the current expansion, but they actually revealed a big new feature coming to the next expansion, which we already know is World of Warcraft Midnight.

741
01:20:45,283 --> 01:20:51,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, they gave this whole, we got our 10-year timeline and it's going to be these three expansions.

742
01:20:51,946 --> 01:20:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

743
01:21:10,504 --> 01:21:12,827
[SPEAKER_02]: is known for, and that is player housing.

744
01:21:13,147 --> 01:21:16,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So player housing will be coming to World of Warcraft.

745
01:21:16,191 --> 01:21:18,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some people are going to be very excited about that.

746
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:30,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, I have no idea if you ever want to play World of Warcraft again, but I could see you decorating your own house because I will never forget your house in Animal Crossing and your basement shrine to fire.

747
01:21:31,008 --> 01:21:31,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

748
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:38,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've recreated that a number of times in things, so who knows?

749
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:39,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

750
01:21:39,555 --> 01:21:43,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the Shrine to Fire in World of Warcraft someday.

751
01:21:43,556 --> 01:21:43,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

752
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:52,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, they released a teaser trailer about it, so they didn't say a lot else about it, except that they're going to need until the next expansion to do it.

753
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:58,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they were asked, so if this isn't coming until midnight, why are you announcing this now?

754
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:00,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in an interview with PC Gamer...

755
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: uh the Warcraft director Ion Hazacostas said we wanted to give players a little sneak preview of some of what the team is cooking this also gives us the chance I think to have more open conversations about it that aren't possible when it's a top secret feature feature so they want to hear what people are excited about what they expect and what they'd like to see from housing so that could be very interesting I would say the biggest drawback in 14 is that because of the um kind of

756
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:34,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Age server infrastructure that datebacks to the horrific 1.0 that that game is kind of stuck on.

757
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:37,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody that wants a house can get one.

758
01:22:38,055 --> 01:22:40,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the biggest drawback of the feature in 14.

759
01:22:40,977 --> 01:22:42,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's what you need to fix in WoW.

760
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:46,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say this, you know, and as much as I have...

761
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:48,382
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

762
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:38,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it would really be that I mean yeah you have to save all of the the variants of the same thing but as far as network it could just be its own instance I'm just trying to think because I think that the reason why all that would be limited is because you are having X number of database elements available

763
01:23:40,276 --> 01:23:46,861
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of that is going to take storage, even if just saying, you know, load item here, load item here, load item here.

764
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:49,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of, you know, just mostly code and text, right?

765
01:23:50,084 --> 01:23:50,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

766
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But

767
01:23:52,711 --> 01:24:06,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about then that when that instance loads, it's not only having however much that just the code itself is going to take up, but it's going to have to load every item in there.

768
01:24:06,386 --> 01:24:13,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It would then have to be really creative about how to implement it for everybody because there are so many working parts in the background.

769
01:24:13,433 --> 01:24:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.

770
01:24:14,494 --> 01:24:18,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if, you know, again, we don't know what it looks like until we see it.

771
01:24:18,739 --> 01:24:27,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if player housing, because we've seen the like the garrisons were something they implemented a long time ago, which was sort of like a player base.

772
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have my house, I think.

773
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:56,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I haven't played in two years, but... Then you don't have your house anymore because they will delete... After I paid for it.

774
01:24:57,376 --> 01:25:00,619
[SPEAKER_02]: They auto-demolish every 45 days if you don't set foot in your house.

775
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: After I paid for it.

776
01:25:04,824 --> 01:25:05,224
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

777
01:25:06,506 --> 01:25:08,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I saved up a lot in-game to buy my house.

778
01:25:08,988 --> 01:25:10,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

779
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a refund of some of it.

780
01:25:11,631 --> 01:25:12,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Pfft.

781
01:25:13,703 --> 01:25:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's just not worth me playing anymore.

782
01:25:15,264 --> 01:25:16,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what pissed Alan.

783
01:25:16,265 --> 01:25:19,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Alan Rage quit the game is they deleted his house because he hadn't played in so long.

784
01:25:19,388 --> 01:25:20,469
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, well, fuck this game then.

785
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:26,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm like, it would be something that they could get needled on.

786
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:28,917
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, technically it is an undertaking.

787
01:25:29,377 --> 01:25:29,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

788
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:30,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

789
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:30,919
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

790
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:33,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Palio, where my whole game is building my damn house.

791
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:34,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

792
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:50,072
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, moving on, let's talk about another story that has to do with some information that came out from an interview this week from Hideki Itsuno, who, of course, used to be at Capcom and is now no longer there.

793
01:25:50,732 --> 01:25:54,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And he left Capcom and, you know, folks were...

794
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:56,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a sniffle.

795
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he of course is left to start a new studio.

796
01:26:16,776 --> 01:26:18,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Lightspeed Studios.

797
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:22,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, you know, it's an exciting new chapter for me.

798
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:24,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got strong development capability.

799
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,822
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to create an original AAA action game titles and yay, you know, all of that stuff to do there.

800
01:26:30,923 --> 01:26:31,743
[SPEAKER_02]: He did say though-

801
01:26:34,605 --> 01:26:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, who knows?

802
01:26:36,526 --> 01:26:36,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

803
01:26:37,206 --> 01:26:42,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But it kind of dug up an old interview where he said, if I was allowed, I'd love to make Rival Schools 3.

804
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to make Dragon's Dogma 2, Capcom vs. SNK 3, Street Fighter Alpha 4, Power Stone 3.

805
01:26:49,411 --> 01:26:51,832
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, even Street Fighter 6 would be amazing.

806
01:26:51,912 --> 01:26:53,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this was before there actually was a Street Fighter 6.

807
01:26:54,373 --> 01:26:54,833
[SPEAKER_02]: He said this.

808
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:57,995
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one we need to get resolution on is Rival Schools.

809
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:21,050
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'm sure Jamie has something to say about that so if I had the voice I'm thinking it really loudly yeah exactly so um but yeah he has he's moved on to establish that studio and there's um some you know interviews coming out about that um yeah I guess a scenario for Rival Schools 3 was actually completed all the way back in 2000 but just did not get to see the light of day

810
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:26,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I was reading today, things that were canceled without ever seeing the light of day.

811
01:27:27,234 --> 01:27:30,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know John Waters was set to make his first movie in 20 years?

812
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:31,337
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years.

813
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:33,439
[SPEAKER_02]: A Dirty Shame came out 20 years ago.

814
01:27:33,759 --> 01:27:35,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was set to make a brand new movie.

815
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know who was going to be the star of this John Waters movie?

816
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: The perfect, the literal perfect modern day celebrity for a John Waters movie.

817
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:45,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Aubrey Plaza was set to star in this movie.

818
01:27:45,268 --> 01:27:45,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I would love it.

819
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,531
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been good.

820
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody will give him the money to make it.

821
01:27:50,652 --> 01:27:51,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody.

822
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:52,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Kickstarter.

823
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:55,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's actually a great idea.

824
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,253
[SPEAKER_02]: John Waters, I will give you money.

825
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's work for other things.

826
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:04,460
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really good idea.

827
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,260
[SPEAKER_02]: He should try.

828
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:05,901
[SPEAKER_02]: He should try.

829
01:28:07,423 --> 01:28:08,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, alright.

830
01:28:09,364 --> 01:28:09,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

831
01:28:10,746 --> 01:28:17,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why don't we move on to yeah, we kind of surprise re-releases of remasters, right?

832
01:28:17,112 --> 01:28:17,192
Yeah.

833
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:20,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's more of a surprise update, I should say.

834
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:29,496
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Definitive Edition wasn't very definitive before when it was hastily ported by Grocery Games.

835
01:28:30,656 --> 01:28:35,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether, I'm sure, it was a lack of time, money, skill, whatever the case may be, it was a mess.

836
01:28:36,139 --> 01:28:59,334
[SPEAKER_00]: um however though between that time since it was released a while ago and now um this new update it was released on and I believe mobile platforms as part of one of the Netflix games uh they're like game library or whatever and these were actually developed by uh Video Game Deluxe

837
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,204
[SPEAKER_00]: who had ported L.A.

838
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:06,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Noire to the VR platforms.

839
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:07,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And so...

840
01:29:08,513 --> 01:29:12,817
[SPEAKER_00]: The thought here is I think that I don't know if Grove Street worked on updates for this.

841
01:29:13,738 --> 01:29:27,410
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some comments made by them because first off, one of the updates that came through with this is that their name has been taken out of the intro, the title screen for the game.

842
01:29:27,611 --> 01:29:29,592
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been relegated to the credits.

843
01:29:30,774 --> 01:29:33,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not happy about that being removed.

844
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:42,283
[SPEAKER_00]: but that these patches were done a long time ago and Rockstar sat on them essentially until it just recently came out.

845
01:29:42,404 --> 01:29:43,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did it fix?

846
01:29:43,765 --> 01:29:46,707
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the updates that they had I think on mobile?

847
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:48,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Better lighting.

848
01:29:48,168 --> 01:29:54,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lighting in FOG is similar to what is in the original games.

849
01:29:55,374 --> 01:29:56,676
[SPEAKER_00]: They've fixed

850
01:29:57,276 --> 01:30:25,641
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the issues with character models and whatnot they've also built in a system where you can run and fire your gun at the same time like the modern Grand Theft Auto games but apparently you couldn't do this in the older versions and also now this has been updated on essentially all the different platforms so now you can enjoy it I don't know if I want to touch it still because it's been touched by it's like too many cooks in the kitchen at this point

851
01:30:27,932 --> 01:30:29,253
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm glad it's getting better.

852
01:30:31,213 --> 01:30:32,674
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paying Rockstar for this stuff.

853
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:37,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why would Rockstar sit on it?

854
01:30:38,117 --> 01:30:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to release this for the holiday season or something?

855
01:30:40,998 --> 01:30:41,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.

856
01:30:41,918 --> 01:30:47,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was a deal that they had with Netflix to put the game on their platform or whatever.

857
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:54,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's some exclusivity deal and so whatever updates they did, maybe that's the version of the game.

858
01:30:54,984 --> 01:30:55,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of think of it like...

859
01:30:57,438 --> 01:30:57,958
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?

860
01:30:58,158 --> 01:30:59,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Amico kind of had the same policy.

861
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:03,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you can release a copy of the game on other platforms, but it can't be the same.

862
01:31:03,141 --> 01:31:05,642
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a unique thing on our platform.

863
01:31:06,022 --> 01:31:07,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that was the deal.

864
01:31:07,943 --> 01:31:13,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but at least it's fixed now, or mostly fixed.

865
01:31:13,585 --> 01:31:13,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

866
01:31:14,245 --> 01:31:14,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

867
01:31:15,973 --> 01:31:22,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, before we get to our next segment, I want to do one more story that comes out of Blizzard, because again, there was a lot of news this week.

868
01:31:22,535 --> 01:31:33,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is a little more about the Microsoft-Blizzard marriage, because one of the big games coming out of Microsoft, or specifically Obsidian, that I think a lot of people are looking forward to.

869
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:34,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I want to check this out.

870
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:36,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game called Avowed.

871
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an RPG that's coming from Obsidian, who makes some good RPGs.

872
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:40,721
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I want to check it out.

873
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:42,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's coming out on February 18th.

874
01:31:44,059 --> 01:32:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: the unique news involving Blizzard that came out this week is that Avowed is going to be available on Battle.net now this is the first I believe Microsoft property to show up on Battle.net now we know that when the Activision merger happened we saw Call of Duty I think um

875
01:32:03,863 --> 01:32:04,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty

876
01:32:19,339 --> 01:32:20,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but it's there.

877
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:20,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

878
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:25,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is interesting that Avowed is also going to be on Battle.net.

879
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exclusively on Battle.net.

880
01:32:26,884 --> 01:32:27,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still on Steam.

881
01:32:28,205 --> 01:32:29,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still on the Game Pass launcher.

882
01:32:30,047 --> 01:32:31,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still all these other places.

883
01:32:31,548 --> 01:32:35,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are doing an intentional sort of awareness campaign within Battle.net.

884
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:36,911
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I can say this.

885
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:41,915
[SPEAKER_02]: This one makes way more sense than Call of Duty did because this is another RPG.

886
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:45,918
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably something that's going to speak to a lot of the same type of fan base.

887
01:32:45,998 --> 01:32:47,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the overlap here.

888
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:50,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I need it on a different launcher?

889
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,900
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.

890
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:56,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess if you go to BattleNet, maybe it makes sense.

891
01:32:56,781 --> 01:32:58,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say this, Loki.

892
01:32:58,402 --> 01:33:01,983
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for people that have a computer just to play World of Warcraft.

893
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:05,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, those people absolutely exist because I used to know them when I played WoW heavily.

894
01:33:06,604 --> 01:33:13,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is to try to target that audience, much in the way that Blizzard products have always tried to kind of target that audience.

895
01:33:14,126 --> 01:33:19,427
[SPEAKER_02]: by launching on Battle.net and cross-pollinating.

896
01:33:19,867 --> 01:33:25,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Blizzard does this in a way I wish most companies would do, sort of raise awareness around their own games.

897
01:33:25,329 --> 01:33:29,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked forever about how Niantic needs to stop existing in silos.

898
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous as fuck that Pokemon Go doesn't have the same quality of life improvements that Monster Hunter now has.

899
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:37,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost like the two companies don't even fucking talk to each other.

900
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:38,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, they're...

901
01:33:39,893 --> 01:33:48,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are some things that Blizzard does very well that now you see with this Microsoft merger, Microsoft would like to leverage for the launch of Avowed.

902
01:33:48,722 --> 01:33:50,123
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the other funky thing.

903
01:33:50,984 --> 01:33:53,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Avowed is going to be a Game Pass game.

904
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have Avowed, you will have it on Game Pass.

905
01:33:57,911 --> 01:34:00,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming it has to be the ultimate or the high level tier or whatever.

906
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:14,743
[SPEAKER_02]: what's on sale now on Battle.net is the limited edition versions of the game so if you want to get the $90 premium edition of the game you will be able to play 5 days early

907
01:34:15,652 --> 01:34:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get some other extra crap.

908
01:34:16,973 --> 01:34:18,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we not learned?

909
01:34:18,035 --> 01:34:18,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that other stuff.

910
01:34:20,017 --> 01:34:21,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I am with you there, Loki.

911
01:34:21,859 --> 01:34:22,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we not learned?

912
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that early access shit has torpedoed a lot of games.

913
01:34:26,964 --> 01:34:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I will point out this game was delayed from its original launch window.

914
01:34:31,609 --> 01:34:33,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

915
01:34:33,591 --> 01:34:34,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, but it's just...

916
01:34:35,663 --> 01:34:38,565
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making sure it's fine-tuned, but I do agree with you.

917
01:34:39,225 --> 01:34:56,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also point out, because logging into my own Battle.net account to play Diablo 4, a game which I play a lot, I have gotten the marketing messages for Avowed that say, included with your Game Pass, upgrade to Premium Edition now for $25.00.

918
01:34:59,496 --> 01:35:01,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I've seen that one.

919
01:35:02,078 --> 01:35:14,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they're selling in this is if you are a Game Pass subscriber, you can instead of paying $90, pay $25, which isn't even the right amount.

920
01:35:15,025 --> 01:35:16,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be $20, but I digress.

921
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:24,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay $25 to upgrade the one you're going to get with Game Pass to play it five days early and get the cosmetic shit.

922
01:35:25,441 --> 01:35:43,632
[SPEAKER_00]: well they're just trying to sell more DLC because that's the thing with Game Pass is like they discount certain tiers of things they discount DLC as well and they're just trying to siphon any money that they can from their Game Pass users I will say as much as I kind of look at that and go

923
01:35:44,585 --> 01:35:45,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking really?

924
01:35:46,566 --> 01:35:48,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for me.

925
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:55,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, if the splash image had been for Diablo 5, I would have been like, click, click, click, click, click.

926
01:35:55,532 --> 01:36:00,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I can admit when my fandom is weak and I will buy things I shouldn't be buying.

927
01:36:01,276 --> 01:36:03,638
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of Avowed, I don't think I'm there.

928
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will absolutely play Avowed when it comes out.

929
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:07,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it, in fact.

930
01:36:07,921 --> 01:36:13,664
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will wait to get my version that I've already paid for with my Game Pass monthly sub on the ultimate level.

931
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:14,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

932
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:41,749
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah but it's just interesting because I don't think I've seen a whole like bridge your game pass subscription to the ultimate edition for 25 bucks I just thought that was interesting yeah there's a few people in chat I noticed they're looking forward to this as well QuestBuster says I'm definitely looking forward to this one Mishkins in chat says I'm excited for this one yeah I am too but obviously they're gonna milk every dollar hopeful yeah

933
01:36:42,165 --> 01:36:42,945
[SPEAKER_00]: for this one.

934
01:36:43,046 --> 01:36:44,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it actually turns out.

935
01:36:45,127 --> 01:36:46,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.

936
01:36:46,187 --> 01:36:46,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

937
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:47,208
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

938
01:36:47,328 --> 01:36:51,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when, you know what?

939
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:56,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You just paid for the cost of the game and DLC didn't fucking exist.

940
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:58,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's roll the bumper for our next segment.

941
01:37:08,984 --> 01:37:16,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

942
01:37:16,772 --> 01:37:19,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

943
01:37:19,874 --> 01:37:21,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I might have to eat my words.

944
01:37:21,736 --> 01:37:24,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this one may have had DLC.

945
01:37:24,198 --> 01:37:28,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget that 10 years was not a long time ago.

946
01:37:28,422 --> 01:37:31,225
[SPEAKER_02]: But DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

947
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Edmund McMillan and Florian Hensel

948
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:59,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came out on Windows first, and then Mac OS X and Linux.

949
01:38:00,113 --> 01:38:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is inspired by the story of The Binding of Isaac, but in the game, of course, it's different.

950
01:38:08,737 --> 01:38:14,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's his mom who gets the message demanding the life of her son as proof of her faith.

951
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:31,385
[SPEAKER_04]: and Isaac runs away from home so you also have access to six other unlockable characters procedurally generated and it's kind of like a nod to Legend of Zelda but there's a reason why it's like that

952
01:38:33,911 --> 01:38:55,327
[SPEAKER_04]: The game actually was a result of a game jam with McMillan and Hensel to do a Zelda-inspired roguelike that McMillan could use to show his feelings about religion, mostly because of conflicts between his Catholic and Protestant family members.

953
01:38:56,828 --> 01:39:03,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, and he also I mean this was, he took the chance because of the success of Super Meat Boy.

954
01:39:04,534 --> 01:39:10,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And he didn't expect many, many sales but it really gained popularity after Let's Play videos.

955
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:25,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did have an expansion called Wrath of the Lamb in May 2012, but they were limited because Flash was dying at the time.

956
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:33,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So they started working with Nintendo for a 3DS version, but Nintendo backed out over the religious themes.

957
01:39:34,796 --> 01:39:47,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did a remake in 2014, still timely, called The Binding of Isaac Rebirth and it brought in the extra features that they wanted to have that was limited in the Flash version.

958
01:39:47,823 --> 01:39:59,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Improved the graphics and enabled ports to other systems including PS4, Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, 3DS, and Nintendo Switch.

959
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:02,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess Nintendo eventually relented.

960
01:40:03,651 --> 01:40:07,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been even rated as one of the best roguelikes of all time.

961
01:40:08,595 --> 01:40:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And Macmillan worked with James Id to do The Legend of Bumbo as a prequel to The Binding of Isaac.

962
01:40:15,881 --> 01:40:16,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's been there.

963
01:40:17,021 --> 01:40:21,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a top-down dungeon crawler presenting in two-dimensional sprites.

964
01:40:22,305 --> 01:40:25,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It flows a lot like The Legend of Zelda, where you have...

965
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:53,816
[SPEAKER_04]: you still have the randomly generated rooms like a roguelike but you have to fight monsters and um you also can you know play this sort of like a twin-stick shooter like it reminded me when I played it as a marriage between um Zelda and Smash TV does that make sense um having played the game yes it makes sense

966
01:40:55,066 --> 01:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_04]: You do pick up different power-ups like pills or tarot cards to refill your life or change your attributes.

967
01:41:05,649 --> 01:41:09,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the effects will stack, so you could become a real badass.

968
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:16,032
[SPEAKER_04]: You are tracked by the number of hearts, and if you lose all of your hearts, the game is a permadeath.

969
01:41:16,052 --> 01:41:18,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to start over in a fresh dungeon.

970
01:41:18,912 --> 01:41:19,672
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a boss...

971
01:41:22,053 --> 01:41:49,700
[SPEAKER_04]: and the main boss is Isaac's mom there's an optional ninth floor which is called Shale which it's not hell if anyone tries to tell you that it's actually called a place of stillness and darkness like an empty place where souls go and your boss is Satan which again that's I guess the Christian version of Satan

972
01:41:51,144 --> 01:42:07,897
[SPEAKER_04]: but anyway so you win the game with certain conditions and you get new power-ups as you go through and it'll track your power-ups as you progress so there are a lot of

973
01:42:09,777 --> 01:42:13,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely is not exactly the biblical story.

974
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:14,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just leave it there.

975
01:42:16,763 --> 01:42:22,828
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way that the story goes is that the mom hears the voice from above, which she thinks is God.

976
01:42:23,509 --> 01:42:28,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And the voice says that her son is corrupted with sin and needs to be saved.

977
01:42:29,374 --> 01:42:46,654
[SPEAKER_04]: and to remove all the sin she takes away all of his toys and drawings his clothes and then says that he must be cut off from all the evil so he's locked in his room and then you know it just basically keeps asking more and more until she's ready to sacrifice him and then you know he runs away

978
01:42:47,675 --> 01:43:14,318
[SPEAKER_04]: so there is an expansion The Binding of Isaac Repentance that had actually a real conclusion of the story but before that came out there were no real conclusions and then the cutscenes between through two of the levels or the different floors Isaac is shown curled up in a ball crying and you can see his thoughts but yeah the

979
01:43:15,508 --> 01:43:17,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really quite the interesting game.

980
01:43:18,669 --> 01:43:40,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, McMillan, when designing the game, he was considering using the scare tactics the Christian right used to condemn the pop, you know, things like heavy metal video games as, I guess, opponent ideas in the game.

981
01:43:41,636 --> 01:43:44,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, weird stuff like toilet humor, you know.

982
01:43:45,077 --> 01:43:50,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically things that might piss off his family, which I thought was funny.

983
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was originally made in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2.

984
01:43:55,261 --> 01:43:57,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they could bring it out as a game on Steam.

985
01:43:58,963 --> 01:44:01,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took off.

986
01:44:02,024 --> 01:44:07,466
[SPEAKER_04]: The demo version of the Steam release was released on Newgrounds.

987
01:44:09,907 --> 01:44:28,017
[SPEAKER_04]: and so it's been out in various capacities and since AS2 is outdated it could slow down a bunch of different computers and let controllers support so when the new release came out it had

988
01:44:28,537 --> 01:44:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch better.

989
01:44:30,077 --> 01:44:36,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Merge Games did a physical edition of the game that had the game soundtrack and a poster for the UK in 2012.

990
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:47,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So the soundtrack was done by Danny Baranowski who had worked with Macmillan on Super Meat Boy and

991
01:44:49,022 --> 01:45:00,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally were able to, you know, with some cooperation, get the soundtrack made and they wanted to put out a dark tone but with some silly undertones so it wouldn't be taken too seriously.

992
01:45:01,571 --> 01:45:13,399
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the songs were inspired by choral music and others, especially for boss fights, were inspired by Uematsu for Final Fantasy music.

993
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:35,497
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a cancelled Nintendo 3DS port for the original but as we learned later on it came out because Steve Singer who is the vice president of licensing and Mark Griffin a senior manager in licensing and Dan Adelman who is the head of indie development were all behind the game so

994
01:45:36,736 --> 01:45:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: There was Wrath of the Lamb that came out May 28, 2012.

995
01:45:41,158 --> 01:45:49,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was an expansion because his wife completely completed the game and wanted more.

996
01:45:50,481 --> 01:45:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, okay, you like the game, here's some more.

997
01:45:53,782 --> 01:46:05,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And it adds 70% more content to the original with more than 10 bosses, over 100 items, 40 unlocks, two endings, additional endings, and two additional optional levels and alternate floors.

998
01:46:06,601 --> 01:46:22,936
[SPEAKER_04]: so it is a pretty thing of course and then Rebirth came out that basically included all of the above plus and like I said came out of multiple systems and the second update after Afterbirth Plus allows for user mods that came out on January 3rd, 2027

999
01:46:24,517 --> 01:46:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: The final update was Repentance and added new content and bug fixes.

1000
01:46:30,058 --> 01:46:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Including a lot of the content from Antibirth, which was a fan-made expansion.

1001
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:42,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a new alternate path through the game and different variations that came out March 31st, 2021.

1002
01:46:44,501 --> 01:46:48,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there was The Legend of Bumbo, which was the prequel.

1003
01:46:51,262 --> 01:46:51,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And

1004
01:46:54,012 --> 01:47:18,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Isaac and Gish both appear in the game Gish is another character and Isaac also was a playable character in Blade Strangers fighting game and the puzzle game Crystal Crisis it was announced in 2018 there's a card game adaptation with Studio 71 called The Biting of Isaac for Souls so Metacritic gave this game an 84 out of 100 based on 30 reviews

1005
01:47:20,981 --> 01:47:25,697
[SPEAKER_04]: and he wasn't expecting anything the game super took off and

1006
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:33,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to read all of the accolades over it, but I can tell you by November 2021, the game had sold over a million copies.

1007
01:47:34,225 --> 01:47:38,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And a quarter of those were partly due to the Wrath of the Lamb extension.

1008
01:47:40,069 --> 01:47:44,972
[SPEAKER_04]: 2024, the game sold over 3 million.

1009
01:47:44,992 --> 01:47:56,560
[SPEAKER_04]: 2015, after Rebirth, the game moved up to 5 million sold, and it also led the way for other roguelikes to come out, like Don't Starve and FTL.

1010
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:11,240
[SPEAKER_02]: so there you go all right thank you for the trip down memory lane even if a little bit recent but not that recent and it's one of those games I seem to remember playing not that long ago but here we are the binding of Isaac

1011
01:48:12,793 --> 01:48:19,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm with SSJ100 Matt in chat that says, I feel like this is one of those games along with Super Meat Boy that was in a lot of humble bundles.

1012
01:48:19,737 --> 01:48:20,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely was.

1013
01:48:21,538 --> 01:48:24,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I had bought this when it first came out, though.

1014
01:48:24,299 --> 01:48:25,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember digging the Zelda vibes.

1015
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:32,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in there, Jamie, you said it was like Zelda mixed with Smash TV, and I'm kind of, yeah, that's a pretty accurate description of what it is.

1016
01:48:32,904 --> 01:48:33,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the gunning part?

1017
01:48:34,204 --> 01:48:35,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1018
01:48:35,545 --> 01:48:35,665
Okay.

1019
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:38,907
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1020
01:49:00,183 --> 01:49:06,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual engagement on a social media platform that doesn't have people I don't want to hear from in the replies.

1021
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:09,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that fucking wild?

1022
01:49:10,452 --> 01:49:10,992
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild.

1023
01:49:11,693 --> 01:49:12,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild.

1024
01:49:12,173 --> 01:49:13,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we'll get to that in a minute.

1025
01:49:13,094 --> 01:49:15,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, some other quick news, Loki.

1026
01:49:16,926 --> 01:49:18,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's talk about some movie news.

01:49:19,588 --> 01:49:30,895
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got word now that Sophie Turner from Game of Thrones fame is going to be playing Lara Croft for the upcoming Tomb Raider series.

1028
01:49:33,136 --> 01:49:34,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.

1029
01:49:34,617 --> 01:49:38,079
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's going to be something we'll see on Amazon.

1030
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:40,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1031
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:41,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Neat.

1032
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:44,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for Sophie Turner.

1033
01:49:44,343 --> 01:49:45,964
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a very, very bad day.

1034
01:49:47,102 --> 01:49:52,285
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of all those video games.

1035
01:49:52,325 --> 01:49:56,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you can do some really good stunts or have a really good stunt person subbing in.

1036
01:49:56,148 --> 01:50:02,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your stunts are up to par because if not, you're going to have a really, really bad day.

1037
01:50:02,872 --> 01:50:04,232
[SPEAKER_02]: All in good fun.

1038
01:50:04,553 --> 01:50:06,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a fun show to see, so good luck to her.

1039
01:50:07,628 --> 01:50:28,279
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and then we've got word that Tom Hardy's uh or the uh I guess adaptation of Splinter Cell featuring Tom Hardy is cancelled no uh Splinter Cell movie I did not even know that was a thing good if I can't have John Waters you can't have your fucking Splinter Cell so fuck you exactly so alright neato

1040
01:50:31,079 --> 01:50:31,479
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1041
01:50:33,541 --> 01:50:42,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's move on and talk about some... Oh, in this segment here with some rapid-fire news, some Black Friday sales we already know about.

1042
01:50:42,627 --> 01:50:44,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you all love your cheap games.

1043
01:50:44,588 --> 01:50:46,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've got my eye on some things for Black Friday.

1044
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:53,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So some Black Friday sales... On one hand, yay, we have some games on sale already.

1045
01:50:54,435 --> 01:50:58,798
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, I need you all to fucking stop with Cyber November.

1046
01:50:58,818 --> 01:50:58,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1047
01:51:00,285 --> 01:51:04,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Friday is bad enough being the day that it is.

1048
01:51:05,528 --> 01:51:07,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not need to be a month-long event.

1049
01:51:08,009 --> 01:51:08,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Buy.

1050
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:10,610
[SPEAKER_02]: You listening?

1051
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Best Buy?

1052
01:51:11,891 --> 01:51:13,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I speaking with Mr. Best Buy?

1053
01:51:15,793 --> 01:51:16,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

1054
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:21,655
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's sales all the time, there's sales none of the time.

1055
01:51:21,815 --> 01:51:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, that's right.

1056
01:51:22,957 --> 01:51:27,762
[SPEAKER_02]: The Christmas lights, or the holiday lights, whatever, do not go up until after Thanksgiving.

1057
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And Black Friday does not start until the day after Thanksgiving.

1058
01:51:32,304 --> 01:51:35,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, no discount will save you as much money as not buying it.

1059
01:51:55,369 --> 01:52:08,085
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest one is Tears of the Kingdom will be $20 off so it'll be down to $50 when you consider Nintendo never puts their shit on sale this is actually a big deal so you get that for $50 Pikmin 4, Super Mario Maker 2 down to $40

1060
01:52:10,988 --> 01:52:12,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing down to $40.

1061
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:15,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who didn't already buy that game during COVID, but work.

1062
01:52:16,213 --> 01:52:23,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Switch Sports, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Odyssey, which is like one of the best Mario games they've made down to $30.

1063
01:52:24,001 --> 01:52:26,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you still don't own that, there you go.

1064
01:52:27,164 --> 01:52:29,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Pikmin 1 and 2 also down to $30.

1065
01:52:30,947 --> 01:52:41,790
[SPEAKER_02]: and a full year of Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack.

1066
01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:43,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there is that.

1067
01:52:43,731 --> 01:52:47,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and obviously, why are Nintendo doing all these deals?

1068
01:52:47,712 --> 01:52:50,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Switch is a lame duck console.

1069
01:52:51,453 --> 01:52:57,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the successor is imminent and a lot of people buying consoles this holiday know that it's going to be imminent.

1070
01:52:59,062 --> 01:53:07,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine there's a lot of people that are going to pass, unless maybe this is for a kid or some other type of family member who doesn't buy the games as fast.

1071
01:53:08,265 --> 01:53:11,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Switch is on its way out, and I think we all know that.

1072
01:53:11,526 --> 01:53:14,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the deep discounts.

1073
01:53:15,587 --> 01:53:17,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how about Xbox Black Friday sales?

1074
01:53:17,968 --> 01:53:19,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have some of those as well.

1075
01:53:20,788 --> 01:53:24,890
[SPEAKER_02]: If you still do not have the Halo Master Chief collection for some reason, that is down to $10.

1076
01:53:26,872 --> 01:53:27,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 6 for $30

1077
01:53:55,549 --> 01:54:15,412
[SPEAKER_02]: that's pretty good Pentament was down to $10 that's from its $20 release game Death Stranding Director's Cut $20 yes on Xbox that was the thing that happened Star Wars Outlaws $52 instead of $70 and then some other discounted games include Resident Evil 4

1078
01:54:16,153 --> 01:54:18,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Techin8, and much more.

1079
01:54:18,494 --> 01:54:20,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, the sales are rolling in fast.

1080
01:54:20,315 --> 01:54:23,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's others that have been announced that just haven't crossed my radar yet.

1081
01:54:23,417 --> 01:54:27,520
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are looking for some cheap deals and games, it's coming up.

1082
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Quest Buster endorsing Pentament in our chat.

1083
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:31,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to check that out.

1084
01:54:31,582 --> 01:54:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Pentament is so good.

1085
01:54:34,143 --> 01:54:34,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.

1086
01:54:35,444 --> 01:54:42,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games you'll pay full price for if you want to play them this week or not.

1087
01:54:43,483 --> 01:54:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Or don't buy them.

1088
01:54:44,124 --> 01:54:45,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your choice.

1089
01:54:45,524 --> 01:54:46,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't.

1090
01:54:46,325 --> 01:54:47,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it.

1091
01:54:47,385 --> 01:54:48,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't do it.

1092
01:54:49,827 --> 01:54:51,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we've hit that era.

1093
01:54:52,689 --> 01:54:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We all remember that campaign when we were kids growing up.

1094
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:55,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it.

1095
01:54:56,071 --> 01:54:56,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Nike, right?

1096
01:54:56,611 --> 01:54:56,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it.

1097
01:54:57,291 --> 01:54:59,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're kind of in that era of, or don't.

1098
01:54:59,953 --> 01:55:00,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't do it.

1099
01:55:02,314 --> 01:55:04,215
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't feel like doing something, just don't.

1100
01:55:04,236 --> 01:55:07,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you want to buy them on sale, you can.

1101
01:55:07,177 --> 01:55:09,359
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to pay full price, you can also do that.

1102
01:55:09,539 --> 01:55:09,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.

1103
01:55:09,979 --> 01:55:10,839
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not your parent.

1104
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:11,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't.

1105
01:55:12,674 --> 01:55:14,015
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1106
01:55:33,246 --> 01:55:38,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I had full intention of buying Dragon Quest III HD 2D this week.

1107
01:55:38,968 --> 01:55:40,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw it was $60.

1108
01:55:41,368 --> 01:55:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Rob, how many hours are you really going to put in this game right now?

1109
01:55:44,889 --> 01:55:45,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, you know what?

1110
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:46,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't do it.

1111
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't.

1112
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:49,471
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1113
01:55:49,691 --> 01:55:53,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a vow that I'm going to make for next year.

1114
01:55:53,872 --> 01:55:54,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1115
01:55:55,023 --> 01:56:13,543
[SPEAKER_04]: is that I am not allowed to buy well especially this is kind of what I'm doing I can't I'm not gonna let myself buy any new video games or art supplies because that's my weakness until I have either used what I have or finished playing what I have and then

1116
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:19,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'm not going to get any more stuff until I've got my room organized.

1117
01:56:19,871 --> 01:56:27,935
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know, it's one thing, and this is actually getting to us now as seasoned gamers, right?

1118
01:56:30,376 --> 01:56:35,038
[SPEAKER_04]: The big shiny stuff is awesome, but we're not going to necessarily be seduced by it.

1119
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:36,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1120
01:56:36,299 --> 01:56:36,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1121
01:56:37,583 --> 01:57:03,196
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think that that gives us freedom to get some of those little you know cheaper things that falls between the cracks if we want to try it and also to fully throw ourselves into what we're playing now to really enjoy what you have right in front of you that's what I'm trying to do anyway all right well let's see let's see what games will be tempted by this week Loki what's coming out in the U.S.? ?

1122
01:57:04,499 --> 01:57:10,169
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Maid Cafe on Electric Street on PC and consoles.

1123
01:57:10,249 --> 01:57:12,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to assume all the big games came out last week.

1124
01:57:14,702 --> 01:57:15,743
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you never know.

1125
01:57:15,983 --> 01:57:16,584
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be big.

1126
01:57:16,864 --> 01:57:19,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how it doesn't specify which consoles.

1127
01:57:19,307 --> 01:57:20,127
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just consoles.

1128
01:57:20,348 --> 01:57:21,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your console's console.

1129
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:23,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope you have one of those.

1130
01:57:23,631 --> 01:57:25,212
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to have in the future.

1131
01:57:25,252 --> 01:57:26,754
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be called consoles.

1132
01:57:27,074 --> 01:57:28,716
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all Nintendos now.

1133
01:57:28,776 --> 01:57:29,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the rage right now.

1134
01:57:29,957 --> 01:57:32,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the Switch 2 needs to adopt as its marketing campaign.

1135
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your console's favorite console.

02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:20,954
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like it's a worldwide release, but it's also hitting Japan on that day.

1164
02:00:21,494 --> 02:00:24,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the PlayStation 5, I'm sure you're going to see a lot of crossover.

1165
02:00:24,577 --> 02:00:26,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You're certainly going to be able to get some new hardware.

1166
02:00:26,618 --> 02:00:30,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The new PlayStation 5 Slim 30th anniversary is out in Japan this week.

1167
02:00:31,421 --> 02:00:32,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is the rest of the world.

1168
02:00:32,882 --> 02:00:36,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And a matching controller for matching service is out there as well.

1169
02:00:37,305 --> 02:00:43,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, other than that, that big console release is really the big release in Japan on the PlayStation 5 front.

1170
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:47,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any of those other games on the list.

1171
02:00:47,171 --> 02:00:47,892
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty wild.

1172
02:00:48,032 --> 02:00:48,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1173
02:00:49,312 --> 02:00:51,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DarkSakura, we'll go to Europe then if you're up for it.

1174
02:00:52,765 --> 02:01:06,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so on the 18th, we have Retro Realms Halloween for PC Switch, the PSs, the Xboxes, and then Retro Realms Ash vs. Evil Dead for all of the same.

1175
02:01:07,317 --> 02:01:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on the 18th, Rogue Command Early Access for PC.

1176
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:16,064
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 19th, we have Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PC and Xbox.

1177
02:01:17,465 --> 02:01:22,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Towers of Agazba, Early Access PC, PS5.

1178
02:01:23,930 --> 02:01:25,511
[SPEAKER_04]: MySims, Cozy Bundle for Switch.

1179
02:01:26,692 --> 02:01:28,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Stray for Switch on the 20th, 20 November.

1180
02:01:30,675 --> 02:01:44,882
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Stalker 2, Heart of Chernobyl for PC and Xboxes Genshin Impact on the Xboxes and on the 21st On Your Tail for PC and Switch Alright

1181
02:01:45,919 --> 02:01:46,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Spam, spam, spam, spam

1182
02:02:13,095 --> 02:02:13,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

1183
02:02:14,316 --> 02:02:15,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to make a quick aside.

1184
02:02:15,798 --> 02:02:16,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1185
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:25,168
[SPEAKER_04]: On Eddie Izzard's performance last night, there was a nod to Monty Python's I Don't Like Spam sketch.

1186
02:02:26,689 --> 02:02:27,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That made me happy.

1187
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:29,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Continue, continue.

1188
02:02:30,153 --> 02:02:30,773
[SPEAKER_02]: More headlines.

1189
02:02:30,813 --> 02:02:31,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple more quick ones.

1190
02:02:31,855 --> 02:02:32,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1191
02:02:33,581 --> 02:02:57,446
[SPEAKER_00]: you want free stuff for the holidays we get free stuff so we've now thanks to Epic Games they have now allowed the internet archive to have Unreal and Unreal Tournament be freely accessible and so now you can play those games for free they're very old but you can still play them for free

1192
02:02:58,376 --> 02:03:24,237
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's awesome Brad yeah good job game preservation that's that's the way it ought to be it's great uh speaking of stuff that's free it's not officially on our list but I have a feeling a lot of our listeners would care to know that the Castlevania collection is the free game on the Epic Game Store this week now the downside is that means you have to have an Epic Game Store account but the upside is if you've already been suckered on one of their prior free game promotions or if you play Fortnite

1193
02:03:24,577 --> 02:03:40,761
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably already have an account so go grab that Castlevania collection because that's all the classic ones it doesn't have like Symphony of the Night and that stuff that was on a later collection but it does have like the NES, Castlevania, Castlevania 4, 3, Simon's Quest I think the Game Boy one's in there

1194
02:03:41,521 --> 02:04:08,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Kid Dracula randomly is in there so it's a really good mix and that's free on the Epic Store right now until Thursday so if you're hearing this either live on Sunday night or you're hearing it before Thursday reminder I would say tie a ribbon around your finger but since this is Castlevania tie a whip around your finger and get that old school Castlevania before Thursday

1195
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:14,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you are morally opposed to the Epic Games Store, in which case, I'm sure there are plenty of other free games out there for you to play.

1196
02:04:15,942 --> 02:04:20,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it will end up in a Humble Monthly here soon enough.

1197
02:04:20,364 --> 02:04:20,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1198
02:04:22,325 --> 02:04:22,585
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.

1199
02:04:23,512 --> 02:04:26,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, well, thank you, DarkTetsuyu, who says, good on Rob for the shout out.

1200
02:04:26,194 --> 02:04:26,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1201
02:04:26,715 --> 02:04:27,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

1202
02:04:27,675 --> 02:04:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: When we say free games, we really should, I almost feel like in some ways, I don't want to propose major changes to the show structure, but I'm always like, maybe instead of talking about new releases, we should just talk about, here's the fucking free shit this week for you to go grab.

1203
02:04:42,105 --> 02:04:43,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could do that.

1204
02:04:43,868 --> 02:04:53,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of more in line with Jamie's goal for next year as opposed to talking about what is new, available for you to spend a lot of money on.

1205
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:55,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Go blow up your backlog with more free shit.

1206
02:04:57,432 --> 02:05:04,876
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be an interesting... Speaking of which, we should mention that Snakebird Complete is also on Epic Games Store right now.

1207
02:05:05,436 --> 02:05:07,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, but it's free and it looks neat.

1208
02:05:08,258 --> 02:05:09,519
[SPEAKER_02]: That was already in my collections.

1209
02:05:09,539 --> 02:05:11,880
[SPEAKER_02]: They've given it away before at some point, but that's alright.

1210
02:05:12,761 --> 02:05:15,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, my library in Epic Games is pretty big.

1211
02:05:15,802 --> 02:05:20,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few things I did purchase, like Borderlands 3, Goat Simulator 3...

1212
02:05:21,892 --> 02:05:48,287
[SPEAKER_02]: the only thing I paid money for besides Fortnite related things because I had to have that Ariana Grande skin just like DarkSakura the only thing I paid money for I also had to have Emma I got Tetris Effect when the PC version was out on Epic Game Store because it was exclusive there and when I got my machine that could do 4K games I was like what game do I want to play in 4K more than anything else and Tetris Effect was the winner

1213
02:05:49,187 --> 02:05:51,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Karim Baros for Raw K-City.

1214
02:05:51,730 --> 02:05:54,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of mistakes on the Epic Games Store.

1215
02:05:56,569 --> 02:05:59,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland 3 is alright, and Goat Simulator 3 is excellent.

1216
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:04,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to grab, I think Goat Simulator 1 is next week or was last week or something, I think that was it.

1217
02:06:04,674 --> 02:06:07,416
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out now, it's like 30 bucks though.

1218
02:06:07,436 --> 02:06:08,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought that was an old game they were giving away.

1219
02:06:08,837 --> 02:06:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, whatever.

1220
02:06:10,338 --> 02:06:14,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it just did the remaster, so it's, that just came out.

1221
02:06:16,182 --> 02:06:22,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if, yeah, if Goat Simulator 3 ever hops into, I mean, it's just worth getting anyways, it's a stupid fun game.

1222
02:06:23,146 --> 02:06:27,750
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Epic Store, they usually show you what next week's games are too, right next to the current week games.

1223
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:29,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll show you the next game.

1224
02:06:29,631 --> 02:06:31,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, yeah.

1225
02:06:31,193 --> 02:06:35,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week is Beholder.

1226
02:06:36,177 --> 02:06:36,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1227
02:06:37,398 --> 02:06:38,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.

1228
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:42,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either, but sometimes they release some indie games in there that are like, oh, I wish I'd seen this before.

1229
02:06:42,822 --> 02:06:45,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some cute little space game that was that way.

1230
02:06:45,865 --> 02:06:46,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never heard of it until I played it.

1231
02:06:47,006 --> 02:06:50,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, I can't remember the name in the moment, but I've discovered some interesting games through that.

1232
02:06:51,758 --> 02:06:51,998
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1233
02:06:52,819 --> 02:07:02,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, but when we talk about getting free games, we mean games that are like licensed to be free, not pirating games.

1234
02:07:03,025 --> 02:07:06,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not something we endorse is pirating current games that are out there.

1235
02:07:07,787 --> 02:07:08,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1236
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:11,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not do that type of piracy or else Nintendo will catch you.

1237
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1238
02:07:36,218 --> 02:07:50,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened is that in 2023, Nintendo hired a law firm, Mitchell Silberberg and Knupp, to investigate free shops, which is what they call pirated Switch game stores online.

1239
02:07:50,888 --> 02:08:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And this legal firm found Archbox and noted, here's some online postings that suggest that Archbox is near Phoenix, Arizona, and at one time into Midwestern University.

1240
02:08:03,382 --> 02:08:10,588
[SPEAKER_02]: and then in 2015, a Reddit user called Archbox posted to a community called Switch Pirates.

1241
02:08:11,208 --> 02:08:15,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a heads up, Reddit, Nintendo's watching you or Nintendo's legal arm is watching you.

1242
02:08:17,153 --> 02:08:25,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Using a turtle avatar posted to r slash Phoenix saying that Midwestern University has an optometry clinic that is very good.

1243
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:28,021
[SPEAKER_02]: You get examined by a student and then the doctor.

1244
02:08:28,362 --> 02:08:30,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you know,

1245
02:08:32,359 --> 02:08:33,180
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

1246
02:08:48,979 --> 02:09:05,857
[SPEAKER_02]: in about February of 2024 Nintendo succeeded linking the name Archbox to Nintendo accounts to the individual James Williams and apparently Nintendo had email addresses for this individual and repair orders

1247
02:09:06,778 --> 02:09:17,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So this pirate at some point, alleged pirate, had apparently requested repairs from Nintendo, and they tied that all together because he lived in Surprise, Arizona, which is a suburb of Phoenix.

1248
02:09:18,187 --> 02:09:18,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise!

1249
02:09:19,067 --> 02:09:19,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise!

1250
02:09:19,768 --> 02:09:23,410
[SPEAKER_02]: We have your address and all this supporting information.

1251
02:09:23,971 --> 02:09:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Please enjoy your cease and desist.

1252
02:09:27,642 --> 02:09:29,443
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty wild.

1253
02:09:29,923 --> 02:09:43,326
[SPEAKER_00]: The moral of the story here is if you're going to commit piracy or do any sort of illegal things, don't use the same email that you use for everything else or the same profile name for everything else.

1254
02:09:43,406 --> 02:09:43,867
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Reddit.

1255
02:09:43,887 --> 02:09:45,007
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just spin up

1256
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:47,302
[SPEAKER_00]: A throwaway account?

1257
02:09:47,502 --> 02:09:47,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy.

1258
02:09:47,903 --> 02:09:48,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you doing this?

1259
02:09:49,285 --> 02:09:49,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1260
02:09:50,227 --> 02:09:54,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil of Nine in chat says, Rob, I've seen your posts in the Nintendogs subreddit.

1261
02:09:54,293 --> 02:09:54,534
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1262
02:09:54,614 --> 02:09:57,999
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I rarely... I don't remember the last time I made a post on Reddit.

1263
02:09:58,140 --> 02:09:59,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably would have either been in...

1264
02:10:00,928 --> 02:10:03,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV subreddit, the Ingress subreddit.

1265
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,711
[SPEAKER_02]: You already know what shit I play.

1266
02:10:06,031 --> 02:10:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the reddits I'm probably looking at.

1267
02:10:08,373 --> 02:10:10,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably something related to RuPaul's Drag Race.

1268
02:10:10,714 --> 02:10:16,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stopped watching that show as frequently as I used to anyway several years ago.

1269
02:10:16,618 --> 02:10:19,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've made a post to reddit in a very long time to be honest.

1270
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:24,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides, Phil, it would not have been the Nintendogs subreddit.

1271
02:10:24,242 --> 02:10:27,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been the Nintendogs plus Cats subreddit.

1272
02:10:28,865 --> 02:10:30,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was the superior version of the game.

1273
02:10:32,701 --> 02:10:33,981
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1274
02:10:35,182 --> 02:10:37,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open it up to you all and some of the things you have to say.

1275
02:10:38,882 --> 02:10:44,464
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to email us for a future episode, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is a great place to do it.

1276
02:10:44,804 --> 02:10:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And we appreciate all of the emails.

1277
02:10:47,965 --> 02:10:52,166
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the interim, we're also getting a few folks that are following us now on Blue Sky.

1278
02:10:52,206 --> 02:10:52,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1279
02:10:53,126 --> 02:10:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You can follow us on Blue Sky at orangelaunchradio.com.

1280

02:10:57,047 --> 02:10:58,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually have your domain.

02:10:58,687 --> 02:11:01,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Be your sort of verified blue sky name.

1283
02:11:01,210 --> 02:11:02,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very easy to find us.

1284
02:11:02,552 --> 02:11:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just at OrangeLondrina.com.

1285
02:11:04,294 --> 02:11:06,556
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, there's also an at VOG Network.

1286
02:11:07,037 --> 02:11:09,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now all the rage is starter packs.

1287
02:11:10,401 --> 02:11:12,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a VOG Network starter pack.

1288
02:11:12,143 --> 02:11:18,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you follow that, you're going to get this show, Bobby, DarkSakura, Loki, me.

1289
02:11:19,951 --> 02:11:22,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, Anime Jam Session.

1290
02:11:22,312 --> 02:11:24,213
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get all that stuff.

1291
02:11:24,834 --> 02:11:26,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of you are in it.

1292
02:11:26,935 --> 02:11:35,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you that have been... Bobby put that together and pretty much if he recognized you as a serial commenter, you're in that pack too.

1293
02:11:35,538 --> 02:11:36,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out.

1294
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:37,699
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1295
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:39,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love you.

1296
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:41,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the serial commenters.

1297
02:11:41,141 --> 02:11:41,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1298
02:11:42,953 --> 02:11:44,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I like cereal.

1299
02:11:45,955 --> 02:11:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Reddit I need to go post on is breakfast cereal, except it's a lot of carbs.

1300
02:11:49,998 --> 02:11:56,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's... So again, because you oftentimes get actual interactions on...

1301
02:11:57,438 --> 02:11:57,999
[SPEAKER_02]: BlueSky.

1302
02:11:58,199 --> 02:12:00,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a kind of tongue-in-cheek post, okay?

1303
02:12:01,121 --> 02:12:06,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this trend on BlueSky called FCF.

1304
02:12:06,606 --> 02:12:09,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell you what it means, what it really means.

1305
02:12:10,129 --> 02:12:16,294
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go to the darker parts of the internet and figure it out, have fun, but don't say I didn't warn you.

1306
02:12:16,474 --> 02:12:17,975
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an X-rated thing, okay?

1307
02:12:17,995 --> 02:12:18,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm going to say.

1308
02:12:19,176 --> 02:12:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But I made a tongue-in-cheek joke, and I posted it on our account.

1309
02:12:21,798 --> 02:12:24,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Happy Fat Cartridge Friday!

1310
02:12:25,475 --> 02:12:27,716
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your favorite Neo Geo game?

1311
02:12:27,796 --> 02:12:29,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Fat Cartridge Friday.

1312
02:12:29,677 --> 02:12:32,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look at what is your favorite Neo Geo game?

1313
02:12:32,578 --> 02:12:34,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put mine is Fatal Fury Special, which is true.

1314
02:12:34,959 --> 02:12:35,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is Fatal Fury Special.

1315
02:12:36,739 --> 02:12:40,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently this got picked up by some Neo Geo fans.

1316
02:12:40,901 --> 02:12:43,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually got some pretty legit responses to this.

1317
02:12:43,782 --> 02:12:44,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So you ready?

1318
02:12:44,943 --> 02:12:47,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rin Mari out there.

1319
02:12:47,584 --> 02:12:48,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to hear from you.

1320
02:12:48,824 --> 02:12:49,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Rin in chat sometimes.

1321
02:12:50,465 --> 02:12:51,345
[SPEAKER_02]: They said Strikers 1945+.

1322
02:12:53,963 --> 02:12:54,943
[SPEAKER_02]: is a good one.

1323
02:12:55,503 --> 02:12:57,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, DarkSakura is here to rate your picks.

1324
02:12:59,624 --> 02:13:01,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I'm here for it.

1325
02:13:01,825 --> 02:13:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Deft says it's hard to choose.

1326
02:13:04,005 --> 02:13:09,006
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a plethora of fighting games like Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.

1327
02:13:09,046 --> 02:13:12,607
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also sports games like Super Sidekicks, Neo Turf Masters.

1328
02:13:12,927 --> 02:13:15,448
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Meadow Slug, Magical Drop, Arrow Fighters.

1329
02:13:15,868 --> 02:13:18,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, Deft couldn't fucking pick one.

1330
02:13:20,009 --> 02:13:20,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1331
02:13:20,529 --> 02:13:20,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1332
02:13:22,349 --> 02:13:29,992
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture said never had that system, to which I replied, well, didn't you ever see like a Neo Geo arcade cabinet at your local pizzeria or something?

1333
02:13:30,252 --> 02:13:31,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And PodCulture said, nope, never.

1334
02:13:31,833 --> 02:13:34,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, cause I never owned a Neo Geo.

1335
02:13:34,214 --> 02:13:35,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things were fucking expensive.

1336
02:13:35,475 --> 02:13:38,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any friends with one either until like- I have one.

1337
02:13:38,456 --> 02:14:04,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I know until like later in life that I met people that had a Neo Geo like years after the fact or I just didn't know them then um but most people I would assume played that four-in-one Neo Geo arcade machine at some point that's how that's how I played Bust a Move you know and all that stuff so that's a little pawn yeah that was my jam uh Magical Drop was another one that came to mind for me Metal Slug yeah um other comments oh this is a good one Dungeon Buster said

1338
02:14:06,178 --> 02:14:09,043
[SPEAKER_02]: DungeonBuster said, I have a soft spot for crossed swords.

1339
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:10,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.

1340
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:11,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1341
02:14:11,281 --> 02:14:11,801
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.

1342
02:14:12,862 --> 02:14:18,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabriel Engard replied and said, Each one in the series is great, but I find myself returning to Art of Fighting a lot.

1343
02:14:19,306 --> 02:14:26,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Giant scaling sprites, iconic sound design, great music, actually solid mechanics, possibly first desperation moves.

1344
02:14:26,271 --> 02:14:27,131
[SPEAKER_02]: A real classic.

1345
02:14:27,972 --> 02:14:29,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Art of Fighting was pretty badass.

1346
02:14:29,093 --> 02:14:29,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good call.

1347
02:14:29,833 --> 02:14:34,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Art of Fighting, the way it did the zooms and all that stuff, and the characters were so fucking big.

1348
02:14:34,236 --> 02:14:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a neat game.

1349
02:14:36,277 --> 02:14:36,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked it.

1350
02:14:38,237 --> 02:14:49,234
[SPEAKER_02]: let's see FoxHack says Art of Fighting 2 I've been a real main for 30 years well and that gave us Yuri and her butt attack

1351
02:14:51,360 --> 02:15:16,438
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says Special was definitely my favorite of the Final Fantasy Fatal Furies Also loved Arrow Fighters 2, Shock Troopers, Samurai Shodown 2, and Metal Slug 2 Samurai Shodown 2 was one who had Chom Chom and it had this little special move so you could turn them into chibis I played that in an arcade until they finally changed it out for 3 and I was very sad

1352
02:15:18,563 --> 02:15:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, SGO100Matt says I always dumped a lot of quarters into any of the metal slugs, but King of the Monsters Super Baseball 2020 and Windjammers were always must plays whenever I came across them in the arcade Oh, that fucking King of Monsters game was on every goddamn Neo Geo cabinet I ever came across in my entire life I'm gonna throw one out right now What's that?

1353
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:46,745
[SPEAKER_04]: The Last Blade series Which I wish I owned a copy of Last Blade 2 for Neo Geo I just have the Dreamcast one

1354
02:15:48,067 --> 02:15:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Deft with a very interesting cultural comment in chat saying, it's like choosing a favorite child.

1355
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:53,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.

1356
02:15:53,832 --> 02:16:00,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, I'm Mexican, as in being literally in Mexico, where I know he listens to the show from.

1357
02:16:01,239 --> 02:16:04,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up on SNK and Neo Geo arcades.

1358
02:16:04,362 --> 02:16:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Were those machines that prolific there?

1359
02:16:06,684 --> 02:16:12,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I never realized that was a thing, but I guess if you're saying that, they must have been pretty prolific there.

1360
02:16:12,589 --> 02:16:28,103
[SPEAKER_04]: there were relatively cost effective machines too because you could buy multiple cartridges and only have to own one machine then you would just switch out your cartridges ended up being a lot more cost effective than having to buy a new cabinet for every new thing that came out interesting point

1361
02:16:29,804 --> 02:16:42,084
[SPEAKER_02]: and Deft confirms in chat, yeah PonyTouchogen in chat, sorry, on BlueSky I'm getting confused, this is why we don't introduce new segments to the show very often PonyTouchogen on BlueSky says Alpha Mission 2

1362
02:16:43,328 --> 02:16:55,195
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we got a screenshot from HKT3030.bsky.social who says, I think probably Metal Slug for me down at the bottom in the shock box.

1363
02:16:55,676 --> 02:17:08,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I've added Samurai Showdown to my collection since this photo was taken and we actually got a picture of a collection here that has a lot of classics in here including there's Windjammers, Garumaka the Wolves,

1364
02:17:09,264 --> 02:17:18,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Hoop somebody's got a very impressive collection over there so DarkSakura I don't know if you can see the collection on Discord but would you rate this person's collection?

1365
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:21,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me see if I can take a look.

1366
02:17:21,902 --> 02:17:23,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awfully small for me.

1367
02:17:23,303 --> 02:17:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, yeah.

1368
02:17:24,944 --> 02:17:27,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Metal Slug, S tier.

1369
02:17:27,426 --> 02:17:32,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Hoop, puzzle bobble, S tier.

1370
02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:34,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Garou, Mark of the Wolves, S tier.

1371
02:17:36,133 --> 02:17:38,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Golf, I don't like golf games, so D minus.

1372
02:17:39,535 --> 02:17:43,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Windjammers, I'll give that a solid A. King of Fighters, 96, right?

1373
02:17:43,899 --> 02:17:43,859
98.

1374
02:17:43,939 --> 02:17:45,440
[SPEAKER_04]: King of Fighters, 98. 98?

1375
02:17:48,496 --> 02:17:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting one.

1376
02:17:49,356 --> 02:17:50,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give that an A+.

1377
02:17:50,857 --> 02:17:51,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1378
02:17:51,837 --> 02:17:54,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Super... I can't see.

1379
02:17:55,078 --> 02:17:55,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Sidekicks 2.

1380
02:17:57,759 --> 02:17:58,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, not into it.

1381
02:17:58,739 --> 02:18:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a C. And then I guess that's Garou Densetsu 2?

1382
02:18:03,381 --> 02:18:04,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the newcomers.

1383
02:18:05,461 --> 02:18:08,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's an A tier.

1384
02:18:09,183 --> 02:18:12,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Real Battle Fatal Fury?

1385
02:18:12,544 --> 02:18:12,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1386
02:18:14,704 --> 02:18:15,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna give that an A-.

1387
02:18:18,845 --> 02:18:23,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe we just tier listed some guy's collection on our show.

1388
02:18:26,091 --> 02:18:29,855
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a couple of... And I actually have some of those too.

1389
02:18:31,156 --> 02:18:37,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a pretty decent collection because even the not-so-great Neo Geo games, they go for money now.

1390
02:18:38,002 --> 02:18:41,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got Magician Lord...

1391
02:18:44,852 --> 02:18:57,792
[SPEAKER_04]: baseball stars we have KOF 2000 we have Summer Showdown 1 and 2 and I can't think of what else we have I'd have to go look in the other room

1392
02:19:00,526 --> 02:19:01,907
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1393
02:19:19,858 --> 02:19:20,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a golfing joke?

1394
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:20,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1395
02:19:21,119 --> 02:19:21,539
[SPEAKER_02]: You decide.

1396
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:21,859
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1397
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:24,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like different strokes.

1398
02:19:25,261 --> 02:19:26,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1399
02:19:26,041 --> 02:19:27,242
[SPEAKER_02]: With different folks.

1400
02:19:27,402 --> 02:19:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: We got another reply from iKamit.

1401
02:19:30,263 --> 02:19:30,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1402
02:19:30,663 --> 02:19:31,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.

1403
02:19:31,884 --> 02:19:32,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, my friend.

1404
02:19:33,145 --> 02:19:35,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be iKamit.

1405
02:19:35,746 --> 02:19:45,351
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's iKamit, who says, The Last Blade 2, something about the mix of King of Fighters-style movement and Samurai Showdown-style combos just vibes with me.

1406
02:19:47,161 --> 02:19:50,223
[SPEAKER_04]: The little cinematics between it really make it for me too.

1407
02:19:51,043 --> 02:19:52,404
[SPEAKER_04]: They're classy.

1408
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:53,404
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good word for it.

1409
02:19:53,424 --> 02:19:54,145
[SPEAKER_04]: They're classy.

1410
02:19:55,986 --> 02:19:56,226
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1411
02:19:56,246 --> 02:19:57,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for those responses.

1412
02:19:57,166 --> 02:19:57,766
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

1413
02:19:57,846 --> 02:19:58,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Blue Sky.

1414
02:19:59,867 --> 02:20:03,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You get an S tier on your work on that assignment this week.

02:20:03,069 --> 02:20:03,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, folks.

02:20:04,410 --> 02:20:04,830
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1417
02:20:04,930 --> 02:20:08,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to make like a MIDI version of Mr. Blue Sky for us to play during that segment.

1418
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:37,195

1419
02:20:39,033 --> 02:21:01,411

1420
02:21:02,076 --> 02:21:04,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then that means we're at about the end of the show.

1427
02:22:03,333 --> 02:22:06,174

1428
02:22:06,634 --> 02:22:07,494
[SPEAKER_02]: What time are you starting?

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I will probably be there at the very beginning, and I can lurk for the day, but I am going to the Bay Area for Friendsgiving that day.

1433
02:22:16,499 --> 02:22:17,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to at least play one game with me.

1434
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:24,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do one game with you, and just for you, DarkSakura, I will do Himbo Chris, just for you, if you want.

1435
02:22:25,443 --> 02:22:25,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1436
02:22:25,944 --> 02:22:26,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1437
02:22:26,744 --> 02:22:27,004
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1438
02:22:27,124 --> 02:22:27,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1439
02:22:28,265 --> 02:22:30,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Himbo Chris Redfield, just for DarkSakura.

1440
02:22:31,044 --> 02:22:40,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where I duck out, but I just want to let everybody know that you don't need a holiday to be thankful for the people in your life.

1441
02:22:43,166 --> 02:22:47,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to show thanks for those sorts of people a lot over the coming months.

1442
02:22:47,287 --> 02:22:47,887
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

1443
02:22:48,967 --> 02:22:49,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1444
02:22:49,567 --> 02:22:52,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we say thank you all for listening and being here, we fucking mean it.

1445
02:22:53,908 --> 02:22:55,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, DarkSakura, for being here as well.

1446
02:22:55,588 --> 02:22:56,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a good stream.

1447
02:22:57,529 --> 02:22:57,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1448
02:22:58,009 --> 02:22:58,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good evening.

1449
02:22:58,629 --> 02:22:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.

1450
02:22:59,841 --> 02:23:02,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go over to Loki.

1451
02:23:02,223 --> 02:23:03,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Your final thought tonight.

1452
02:23:04,165 --> 02:23:06,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very busy two weeks even though I'm off work.

1453
02:23:07,248 --> 02:23:07,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

1454
02:23:08,049 --> 02:23:08,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for you.

1455
02:23:09,411 --> 02:23:18,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you're actually going to get to do creative or is it going to be, nope, you're off work, go clean the backyard or something, like do projects around the house?

1456
02:23:18,860 --> 02:23:21,483
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thankfully we have people that do that kind of thing.

1457
02:23:21,503 --> 02:23:21,803
[SPEAKER_00]: No, um...

1458
02:23:23,244 --> 02:23:28,567
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I will try to get... I need to get that one build done.

1459
02:23:28,587 --> 02:23:31,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to work on that as much as I can.

1460
02:23:31,668 --> 02:23:34,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I still wanted to get another episode out before that.

1461
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:37,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to have that done this weekend, but the Redstone's taking too long.

1462
02:23:37,812 --> 02:23:40,253
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to figure out everything.

1463
02:23:40,313 --> 02:23:50,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I have it done, all of the assets are done, it's just going to be figuring out what the build's going to look like and maybe putting out an episode...

1464
02:23:51,116 --> 02:24:18,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that to take too much time up though because like I said I only have two weeks to get this thing done and it's massive so we'll see alright well then my final thought is I was really upset because I recorded a great ColecoVision look back for my YouTube channel at Rob Roberts Plays but I had massive sound fail so I'm going to have to re-record it tonight and I hate to say it was a good one because I played the Smurfs Adventure on ColecoVision

1465
02:24:20,037 --> 02:24:21,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I still love that.

1466
02:24:21,558 --> 02:24:22,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that fucking game.

1467
02:24:22,938 --> 02:24:35,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to re-record it tonight, but unfortunately it won't be quite as I'm actually debating maybe doing the Atari version instead because, I don't know, I'm kind of going back and forth in my mind right now because it's like, oh well shit, I already played the Coleco one now, it just didn't get recorded right.

1468
02:24:35,844 --> 02:24:41,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But such is the lives and dreams of a YouTuber, sometimes you fuck up and it ruins the whole project, right Loki?

1469
02:24:43,007 --> 02:24:43,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1470
02:24:43,638 --> 02:24:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, when we fuck up here on OLR, we just say, fuck it, we're putting it out anyway.

1471
02:24:48,101 --> 02:24:50,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can edit that part out, right?

1472
02:24:50,283 --> 02:24:52,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it's very rare we actually edit it out.

1473
02:24:52,625 --> 02:24:54,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be really bad to get it edited out.

1474
02:24:54,646 --> 02:24:57,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so we just do it live, I guess.

1475
02:24:58,169 --> 02:25:00,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back in seven days to do it live all over again.

1476
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:01,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so much for being here.

1477
02:25:01,971 --> 02:25:03,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a wonderful week.

1478
02:25:03,332 --> 02:25:04,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, and we'll see you next time.

1479
02:25:05,033 --> 02:25:05,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, everybody.

1480
02:25:07,655 --> 02:25:09,917
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1481
02:25:12,379 --> 02:25:12,879
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week.
