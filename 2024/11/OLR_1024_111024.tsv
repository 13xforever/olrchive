10211	11291	Marketing is a weird beast.
11451	14492	Existing customers lose features in order to subsidize new customers.
14753	16833	Obviously, a company needs growth, but where's the line?
17073	22435	How often does a company try to lure new customers at the expense of their existing ones, making the problem worse on both fronts?
22795	23455	Too often.
23816	27757	The enshitification of GeForce Now starts in 2025, and it was already pretty niche.
28457	29857	This is the Service Graveyard Headline.
30098	34879	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35099	37160	Starting right now on the show, wherever your gamer has a voice...
39764	42005	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42065	45787	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46047	48228	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48328	54270	We're live once again with episode number 1024 for tonight.
54850	60773	Interestingly enough, November 10th, 2024, so there's like a 10 and a 24 if you believe in that
61173	61713	DarkSakura.com
87278	89619	Perhaps they'll join us and chat a little later on tonight.
89679	95401	But if they're napping through the entire show tonight, then I don't blame her whatsoever.
95541	98322	So yeah, so she'll be out tonight.
98442	100903	But of course, we do have joining us this week.
101263	102403	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
103184	103464	Hello.
103624	104104	Hi, Loki.
104124	104484	How are you?
105384	105684	Pretty good.
106485	108766	Interesting choice of the game playing behind you tonight.
108806	112967	You have a little video game capture of Wolfenstein 3D.
113047	114027	Wolfenstein 3D.
114187	115388	What brought this game to mind?
116640	123864	You know, sometimes you gotta kill some Nazis That's right, that's, yeah, always, always, alright So, yeah, this takes me, you know what's funny?
123945	142375	I was thinking about this game just a couple days ago And nothing, nothing to do, like, no jokes about the news or anything But I was at a, like, a gathering of gay gamers here locally with a friend of mine And, you know, we were looking around the game library And one of the games that I decided to play was Doom 2
143536	166825	and it just caused this whole throwback conversation to like you know the 90s and how we used to play these like really simple because somebody in the room commented who had to have been like in their mid-20s was like you can't even jump in this game and it's like oh no you sweet summer child oh where would you where would you oh you mean in Doom 2 yeah Wolfenstein where would you jump you hit the ceiling
167145	195514	and then it was like one of those like yeah the games back then there wasn't like you know it was it was very simple and then that kind of went to talk about Wolfenstein 3D and it was like I remember the big thing that we used to do as the map editors back in the day right like I loved and I I know you being the Minecraft modding person that you are have built several Wolfenstein 3D maps in your day I'm sure oh yeah oh yeah of course do you ever build any do you
196921	223625	I did not build any Doom maps I did Duke Nukem I did Duke Nukem maps with the build engine Wolfenstein I did build maps at least a couple maps one of the things that the neighbors used to like to do is make super violent mods I guess we just, hey let's put some more red pixels in there, you know that would be fun so we did that for a while
224278	224698	That's neat.
225058	240604	I remember the most famous like mod I remember for Wolfenstein was the Mortal Kombat one where it turned like the bosses into Mortal Kombat characters that would do, you know, when you, it was really gross deaths and everything when they got, you know, unalived and all that stuff.
240684	242405	So yeah, good times, good times.
242745	251709	Yeah, or just hard maps with all of the, you know, spoiler Pac-Man characters because there's the Pac-Man ghosts that were, you can't kill them.
252729	253250	Oh my gosh.
253310	253931	Impossible to kill.
254051	258697	So it's like, it's like Asshole Mario or those really hard Mario Maker levels, but in Wolfenstein.
259838	260499	Yeah, it was fun.
260539	268188	And then of course, you know, uh, making all of the movable walls, just like, just make them all over the place because that was fun.
268208	268669	Yeah.
269628	272029	I feel like we need more open-ended creative games.
272049	274571	The market's kind of softened on that a little bit.
274631	278533	And I realize that sounds ridiculous talking to somebody who does a ton of Minecraft videos.
278893	282996	But I'm thinking of things like we haven't had a Mario Maker or a little big planet.
283036	285097	We had the story recently about the server shutting down.
285277	285577	I don't know.
285617	291360	I feel like that casual level-making, sharing mode thing has kind of disappeared for a minute.
291380	294242	Unless there's something I'm not thinking of, which is completely possible.
294262	294342	Yeah.
294542	319760	I'm surprised people haven't I mean I'm sure someone's experimented with it somewhat but like I would think that the file formats for these older games especially like Wolfenstein 3 and stuff to create the levels uh would be something that like a AI or like a machine learning model would be able to kind of like at least figure out the format like to build the level for you like hey I want a level
321611	324953	I want you to make 10 levels for me or something like that and just see if it can create a map.
325314	335420	Not necessarily the whole route that we have with the AI Minecraft thing where it's not really Minecraft, it's just trained on images of Minecraft and so it's all...
336670	339013	and you know, Trippy because it forgets everything.
340034	354032	But like something you'd say, okay, you know, the map should have a start and an end and you should have enemies inside and they should have rooms and they should be connected by doors and basically set that up for you because I wouldn't think that would be that hard to like
355456	384378	that could be interesting you know obviously there's you know limits to the artistic use of AI that I can support but that could be interesting like something that starts building the level for you with like an AI prompt and then you can go in there and you know zhuzh it up around the edges and really make it what your vision of it is that could be very interesting that's the thing like with AI and a lot of like the design stuff like I could see
386056	391762	that being used in game development but like say you wanted to
393660	397541	I'm going to create an ancient city level or something like that.
397601	401102	You could tell the AI, hey, this is what I'm looking to create.
401202	407284	Can you gray box this for me and just create the kind of structure?
407304	409965	And then the artists come in and go, okay, here's the structure of it.
410025	415486	And now we're going to actually make it look like something nice and just design that.
415847	420348	Sometimes even level design anywhere, because I'm going to have to deal with this next season.
421148	422430	with designing a dungeon.
422490	425013	Level design can be kind of hard, like, figuring out, like...
426338	454686	what I want I want to have it be somewhat even but yet random and a maze I think you could train AI to I keep saying AI but machine learning you train a model to figure that out or at least assist in that that might be kind of helpful not necessarily like let's create the final product as some higher up execs want to do it's like no you can't talk to a hammer and say okay create me a cabinet
455856	457157	Well, I'm waiting.
457777	458318	What's going on?
458858	467604	You gotta have something where you can just speed up the process, but then let the artists actually take it and finish it.
467804	468604	I think that would be...
469710	476794	Something that, you know, everybody could be on board with making your job easier, but not like replacing the artists.
477395	478095	Yeah, exactly.
478135	479476	Or the coders.
479676	483978	As it should be, a tool to help jumpstart things, but not to replace things.
484159	485880	That's like the key difference, right?
486420	491223	So yeah, I would see that sort of design as like it's jumpstarting, but it's not doing it all, right?
491243	491323	Yeah.
492143	504835	Yeah, because there's a lot of like AI stuff, even like in content creation spaces, like they've got, you know, vidIQ and 2B or whatever the thing is, 2Buddy or I don't remember what it's called now anymore, but I don't use it.
505156	513243	vidIQ, for example, they'll try to do, hey, we'll use AI to design you a thumbnail or AI to design you like a...
515208	539719	a title for your video and they usually all suck like they're awful and and so it's like that is that's more of a buzzword and to trying to sell something to somebody doesn't know what exactly that means but a lot of times it's about as good as one of those like random generators like hey I need a I need a Star Wars name for my character let's go to the random generate and keep hitting you know generate and see what we get and
540719	542220	It's not great.
542360	545000	Did you hear Tony Todd passed away this week, which is really sad?
545100	545741	Horror icon.
545761	547101	Candyman was his most famous role.
547641	548902	Ah, yeah, yeah.
548942	553483	Well, so Final Destination, you know, is a really, really, really big loss in the horror community.
553503	556544	He's been here for the horror conventions a couple times and really sad.
557024	563306	And I saw, you know, people are posting their tributes online and I saw this one tribute that was an AI-generated art
563866	584763	of like Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers standing around a tombstone that said Candyman and my only thought I had two thoughts I was like number one I mean no disrespect to Tony Todd who is a legend in the horror industry and everything but the reality is if wouldn't wouldn't serial killers like that be celebrating that somebody died like why would they all be sad
585804	588386	This is a bit of a logic problem there.
588446	589667	They're unionized.
590108	591089	They have a union.
591109	591989	Apparently.
592009	595572	When they lose one of their own, it is a sad time.
596353	604520	Granted, that industry is not looked highly upon, but they have their... And the other thing I was like, if I ever pass away...
605140	631035	please please please please please please please do not honor me with some fucking AI generative thing please do not do that you don't I would rather you just I would rather a white text on black background twitter apology from a corporation I would rather that because at least maybe some thought went into that you know I like you know an AI generated uh Betty White or whatever like crouching in a grave throwing up a peace sign you know like that oh
632833	635835	An AI Betty White welcoming me into heaven.
636496	636996	Oh, my God.
637717	639158	Okay, let's just talk about it.
640239	650167	Now, if someone could create an AI Betty White that could be your house assistant that you could talk to, I mean, that's not the worst thing that we could be using AI for.
650507	657573	I'm sure it's just one of those, like, I'm sure we're only moments away from Siri voices being that potentially, you know, or those type of AI assistant.
657593	658474	I'm sure it already exists.
658854	687709	but anyway like I don't want to just you know again it's when it replaces art that it bothers me I actually I'm really intrigued by your idea on where it could go for game development as far as like you know I think that's very interesting the idea of like a game like let's say a little big planet type of game or even like a Dreams like Dreams was really ambitious right and like what if Dreams could sort of have that jump start mode where maybe a prompt like that sort of starts you off and gets you the skeleton and then you're in there filling in the gaps I think that that would be
688129	688789	Kind of bomb.
689269	690250	I'm really interested in that.
691130	696352	And a lot of those things, I wouldn't necessarily say it should be a big open thing.
696552	701893	Have your own studio come up with your own criteria for your types of game that you make.
702053	707775	If it's Ubisoft, it's like, okay, where are we going to put our radio towers?
708536	709636	AI figured that out for us.
710936	712537	Something to the effect of like,
713157	721279	Yeah, just generating the general shape of the land and just kind of where, okay, landmarks should go or something like that.
721319	731002	And then you have the artists come in and like, okay, because it's essentially when you're like prototyping it with like the gray box stuff, you know, that's what you're doing is just laying out where things can go.
731062	735703	And I don't think like AI stepping in to assist with that is going to be like the end of the world.
735723	738364	It's like, oh no, it told me to put that crate over there.
738404	741845	We're stealing some artist's interpretation of where the crates should go.
742265	751431	I mean, if you think about a game like No Man's Sky, everything, and I love that game, everything on the planets, that is AI in a sense.
751832	760537	It's based off a generative model type of thing, and it's fine because it's not, you know, everything is generated on the planet.
760597	763640	It's not the actual, you know, like art that goes into it and all that other stuff.
763680	763900	Anyway.
764440	765381	BobbyBlackWolf.com
779978	780439	and DarkSakura.com
796676	798957	Uh, PogCulture saying, we need a new Sackboy game.
799617	802037	Uh, Dart2Studio saying, I think there was a newish Lode Runner.
802397	805238	I don't know how the level building stuff worked, if you could share it or not, though.
805798	806858	Um, I think you could.
807278	816020	But Lode Runner, and I, I love Lode Runner and what it meant for, like, it really is, like, the earliest form of a Mario Maker, that type of thing.
816380	819501	But Lode Runner really feels like a dated IP at this point.
819521	823942	Like, it's a really, like, they really just haven't really been able to innovate on that because, and it's,
825802	827343	It's a relic of a different time, right?
827443	831944	I think it's a very hard thing to innovate on.
832084	836085	So I didn't care for the new Lode Runner that much.
836105	839666	I remember playing it just a little bit, but I was like, it just kind of feels dated at this point.
841826	842246	Let's see.
842386	847388	And yeah, people are talking about the tribute for me someday, which is a little morbid.
847468	852609	But DJ Ranma S says, I can picture the Golden Girls and Richard Simmons sitting around a table enjoying mojitos.
854113	854714	possibly.
854834	855995	I guess mojitos are pretty good.
856015	856916	I'll accept mojitos.
859379	859680	Anyway.
860983	865364	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, the thing we actually wanted to talk about tonight.
865664	870566	And Nintendo announced something, but you might have missed it, Loki.
871426	874187	I don't think you did at this point, but Loki, what happened this week with Nintendo?
874947	885430	So they announced that the Switch successor will be backwards compatible with the Switch, though they announced it like in the middle of all this election nonsense that was going on.
885450	885690	Mm-hmm.
886030	901554	so it's it was kind of out of nowhere but yeah they said that the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor as well and that yeah it will be backwards compatible with your game library.
902114	914377	Yes and to be fair and I'm sure you know this but for everybody out there be sure to critically think why would Nintendo announce this right in the middle of all the election fuckery in America because where is Nintendo based?
914775	920579	Japan, and they were doing a scheduled earnings call, just like they tend to do in America with those companies.
920879	926043	And of course, the Japanese calendar is not going to revolve around American stuff.
926083	928524	And when it was nighttime here, it was daytime over there.
928544	929985	It was the perfect time for the earnings call.
930025	932807	So I think we all understand the timing of that now.
932867	935149	It's just one of those weird coincidence type of things.
935629	937831	I'm pretty sure that was self-explanatory.
937891	941333	But just to clear the confusion, because I definitely saw
941673	949115	Just a couple people out there who, you know, and I can understand why people were letting their guard down on election night a little bit, but, you know, you all got to critically think a little bit.
950055	952015	Does Nintendo follow the American calendar?
952155	952995	No, they don't.
953596	955576	So, yeah.
956116	961497	But a little more about, like, why this news probably came out overall, you know, I was kind of thinking about it a little bit.
962017	970059	I think this might be, and the reason why they've announced it now in November before the Prime shopping season is simply that they don't want to cannibalize sales of Switch software.
970399	971380	Yeah, I think that's it.
986195	993841	You know, still, the games that are coming out throughout the holiday season, Nintendo wants to assure you that if you buy it, you're not just going to suddenly not be able to play it anymore.
994242	996323	You know, and I think that that was a real concern for people.
996363	1004530	And I think sometimes towards the end of life for a certain console may make them a little sluggish, like, well, why would I buy this new game now?
1004970	1005250	DarkSakura,
1025899	1026560	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1038751	1040733	Maybe it was the Wii and Wii U like that.
1041053	1044076	Or I think you still have to repurchase everything, if I remember correctly.
1045257	1047859	But yeah, it kind of sucks.
1047879	1051121	You'd have to transfer from one console to the next, which is just dumb.
1051402	1056726	So I'm hoping that this century... You would boot your Wii U into a Wii mode.
1057347	1060429	And you could transfer everything from your Wii, if I remember right.
1060709	1061570	That's right.
1062070	1065333	Gosh, we forget how dumb these things were in the past.
1066174	1070581	I'm thinking it'll be a little smoother this time, but we'll see.
1070661	1071282	I hope so.
1072403	1075949	RecordWN says, so we thinking holiday next year or what?
1077251	1080535	I think probably end of March.
1081664	1084126	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1105043	1109527	It's extremely disappointing, to put it mildly, that things went the way they did.
1110548	1112771	There's a lot of things negative I could say about that.
1114532	1119117	All I know right now is that we're gonna probably need community and we're gonna need each other more than ever.
1120257	1131142	And so, you know, you've got to really find your people and find your community and take care of each other because Lord knows the rest of the world, or at least the rest of America, excuse me, specifically, the rest of America does not give a shit about you.
1131702	1132242	That's for sure.
1132282	1138745	The rest of America will sell you up the fucking river for cheaper gas and eggs, or excuse me, the illusion of cheaper gas and eggs.
1139445	1142987	So, yeah, this is extremely disappointing.
1143547	1148550	Isn't it weird how the gas prices are coming down even though there's not a new president in office yet?
1148991	1149931	It's so strange.
1149991	1151913	It's almost like they're unconnected.
1152713	1152873	Yeah.
1155489	1167295	You know, and I've been trying to unpack and there's been a lot of finger pointing and blame placing, especially people that are generally liberal, blaming other people who are generally liberal, which is really the worst possible thing you could do right now.
1167436	1168836	I'm not really interested in doing that.
1169257	1176921	I will say if I had to go down that route, I think it's very obvious to me that the person who made the wrong decision was Joe Biden.
1177821	1195615	and I completely respect Joe Biden and think he's done a lot of great things to this country but the fact that he did not read the tea leaves a lot sooner the fact that he kind of went back on his you know one term he was going to be pass it on to the younger generation that whole thing a long time ago and went back on that he waited way too fucking late to drop out in this process
1196715	1201138	and Rob did the party of a primary process and all the things that come with that.
1201498	1203619	Now, I think Kamala Harris is a great fucking candidate.
1203879	1210003	And I think especially considering the circumstances, she ran a hell of a fucking campaign when you consider it was only, what, 100 days?
1210563	1216326	And if you look at the states where they focused all the attention, those seven swing states, did they win them?
1216506	1216767	No.
1217107	1224351	But did they close the gap closer than they did in the states where she wasn't running the TV ads and those sorts of things constantly?
1224711	1229432	Yeah, so it's almost as if the country had more time to kind of get to know her as a candidate.
1229773	1232373	There would have probably been a higher chance that that would have happened.
1232953	1238415	So I would prefer to have a choice, though, of who was running instead of just like, I mean, yeah, that's going to be them.
1238475	1239815	That would have been nice.
1240096	1241096	But, you know, I
1242236	1246999	I like to think in that situation, there's a lot of me that probably would have went for Kamala anyway, but we'll never know.
1247519	1250921	And unfortunately, that decision from Joe Biden ruined us of that opportunity.
1251342	1268992	And again, I'm not here to shit on him because he's done a lot contrary to what other people will try to tell you when it comes to the economy, when it comes to us rebounding out of COVID, when it comes to a lot of the things we have access to and sanity and all that stuff, he's done a lot.

1281592	1288498	Anyway, I want to kind of move on from that part of it because the other part of that, and this is very important, this is the other reason why we lost.
1288699	1301891	And this is what folks who can't stand Trump and everything, folks that are the worst of the worst, this is what they're doing very well.
1302810	1303471	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1320265	1321327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1335966	1337508	A couple different ways, quite frankly.
1337969	1343394	They decide to tell you what the meaning is behind that and push that in your face over and over and over and over and over again.
1343915	1355107	And there's these – you could find very easily a hundred cases of hypocrisy where one side does one thing, the other side does the exact same thing, but it's always the left's fault every single time.
1356318	1358261	and it's not just Fox News.
1358642	1360945	It's all these series of podcasts that are out there.
1361345	1368595	It's all these series of influencers, YouTube and it's also now social media.
1369016	1371419	It's X. It's that website.
1372523	1376386	which we all know what happened to X. And no, I'm not going to call it Twitter anymore.
1376446	1377466	Twitter's fucking dead.
1377866	1380068	Twitter is fucking dead and it's been dead for years.
1380628	1383750	It's X. And X is a right-wing platform.
1384571	1386252	And that is a big problem.
1386752	1397919	You know, we don't have, when you look at all those things, when you look at influential left podcasts, when you look at influential TV networks that are played in the dentist's office in the South of America, when you look at all those things, we don't have any of that.
1398820	1399140	None of it.
1400370	1401170	That's the problem.
1401210	1409494	Until we're able to fix that and get the messaging out more effectively, then maybe when we have a 100-day campaign, we can get things out.
1409914	1411514	But do you think the view is going to do it?
1412235	1412455	No.
1412555	1414916	Do you think MSNBC is influential enough?
1414996	1415436	Not really.
1415916	1419678	There's not a lot of people that are tuned in to niche news channels that much.
1420018	1422859	How many dentist offices are playing MSNBC in different parts of the country?
1423819	1427621	And it shouldn't really be tilted any way, one way or the other, to be quite frank.
1429215	1431897	Anyway, I realize that might be a lot of politics for you all.
1432017	1432617	I don't really care.
1433238	1437060	These are things that are going to affect my life and me personally.
1437100	1440583	I can sit here and hope for the best, but I'm absolutely going to prepare for the worst.
1441123	1446207	And I don't need a fucking lecture from other people trying to tell me how to feel about it.
1447661	1448582	I just don't.
1448622	1450043	Fucking spare me.
1450163	1453446	If you tell me that I have nothing to worry about, great.
1453687	1458010	Why don't you actively work to make sure that I have nothing to worry about?
1458070	1459632	Because words are fucking empty.
1460140	1469129	I love the messaging too that they say that we have to rally around this new president despite the fact for the last four years they have been saying fake.
1469149	1471131	That's the hypocrisy thing, right?
1471452	1472212	All that again.
1472673	1473334	All that again.
1473454	1475155	So just anyway, I'm over it.
1475236	1479340	But yeah, believe it or not, yes, I remember this all started with a chat comment.
1479720	1483224	Record WN in chat says, so we thinking holiday next year or what?
1484488	1485669	Sorry, Record at WN.
1485810	1487271	I don't blame you for the political tangent.
1487331	1488332	It was coming either way.
1488973	1491336	But here's the answer to this question the more I think about it.
1492317	1496121	Nintendo was supposed to announce that successor console this year, at least for all intents and purposes.
1496161	1498164	They didn't, and we've all been frustrated by that.
1498524	1500687	Why haven't they announced the successor console yet?
1502047	1503588	I think they're waiting some of this out.
1504068	1505208	They don't know what's going to happen.
1505728	1515111	I think at this point, I think everything that's happened in America, you just confirmed this console's not getting announced until next summer because they don't know what it's going to cost.
1516251	1519632	Nintendo cannot come out now and say the Switch successor's going to cost $499.
1520032	1521212	They can't do it.
1521452	1521852	They don't know.
1522273	1523593	They don't know what things are going to cost now.
1524574	1525995	Yeah, I don't know if that's why.
1526115	1540086	I think when they said this year, I think they're talking about this financial year, which they still have time, and I still think it's going to be kind of along the lines of how they announced the Switch, which was it was basically a few months prior to it coming out, and then it was out.
1540606	1569821	and I think that's what they're going to do again because they don't really need to go any longer than that and tariffs or not I think they're still going to I mean they're not going to like hold the console just because of tariffs and it's going to take some time before that even gets in place and I'm sure there's people going to talk them out of it because it's a dumb idea anyways everyone's like yeah it's good because he's an idiot and doesn't understand how tariffs work and that the price what corporations absorb that cost god no you know the consumer will absorb that cost
1569921	1573362	Let's talk about all the people that are googling what are tariffs after election day.
1573402	1575482	That's a whole other issue.
1575502	1576882	But that's the communication issue.
1577422	1579023	That should have been known a long time ago.
1579043	1581583	There's a lot of embarrassing things I've seen.
1581863	1587644	There was a whole segment on, was it Kimmel or whatever, talking about people saying, hey, so who are you voting for in the election?
1587684	1590005	This was literally the day after the election.
1590025	1591785	They're like, oh yeah, I'm voting for this person.
1591865	1593165	I'm ready to vote tonight.
1593185	1595166	It's like, you know that was yesterday, right?
1596546	1596886	You know, just...
1598066	1601587	It's just, there's so many reasons to be disappointed with people.
1602747	1605308	You know, there's 10 million people that sat at home.
1605828	1607969	It's like, okay, okay, well then don't complain.
1609189	1610730	I don't want to hear any complaint from these people.
1610890	1617072	Again, the lesson I've learned is that Americans don't give a fuck about me.
1618152	1618492	They don't.
1619880	1622924	and that's the lesson I'm taking away from all this.
1623304	1626828	So I'm going to take precautions to protect me and my people and the people I care about.
1627208	1631152	And the people that are celebrating this, you can all have each other.
1633055	1635817	Do not ring my phone when problems start.
1636018	1637239	Do not ring my phone.
1637419	1637920	I am busy.
1642031	1646293	Anyway, so yeah, we don't know what these things are going to cost now.
1646353	1650835	I mean, yeah, how fast can these things really move?
1650915	1655097	And we already know that now there's going to be all these legal challenges.
1655257	1656818	And I think it's kind of interesting.
1656858	1663241	They're probably going to use some of his strategies against him and try to delay, delay, delay with the legal process and all this stuff.
1663261	1664001	So...
1666955	1668756	We'll see.
1668936	1669336	We'll see.
1669416	1678698	But I remember the first time he was in office, every morning we'd wake up and it's that Picard meme going, damage report.
1680199	1682599	That's going to be what it is for the next little while.
1682619	1684480	We're going to wake up every morning and go, damage report.
1684780	1686120	What's going to be more expensive today?
1686220	1689361	What fucking tweet started a symbol under us now?
1690541	1691242	Don't you worry.
1691462	1696647	When the four years is up, I'm sure they'll blame the Democrats for anything that he fucked up in office.
1696727	1697147	Exactly.
1697207	1702392	When they have full control of the entire government, I'm sure somehow it will still be Democrats' fault.
1704034	1712202	When the measles have come back because, you know, RFK is going to go wild with healthcare, that'll be why.
1712342	1714364	Anyway, do not call.
1717252	1720094	Where's that Kamala meme of her going, do not come.
1720394	1720774	Do not come.
1721094	1721915	That's me right now.
1722155	1723936	When everything goes to hell, do not call.
1725077	1725617	Do not call.
1727098	1727598	Do not call.
1728178	1729199	But hey, Blue Sky is nice.
1729619	1731200	I love Blue Sky.
1731260	1741265	One thing I will say about Blue Sky that is kind of nice, you know how they have those giant lists of all these horrible MAGA people or Nazi people that list their stuff in the comments?
1741746	1746088	Blue Sky has an option where you can go to those lists and ban them all or block them all.
1746508	1747028	All at once.
1747089	1747789	It's so great.
1747829	1748970	You don't have to go one by one.
1749030	1752772	It's just hundreds of people you'll never have to hear from ever.
1752812	1759357	Blocking is a great mechanism on Blue Sky because it works even differently than X because they vanish.
1759737	1764360	Like when you just like literally like you never existed and they never existed.
1764420	1765441	It's it's fabulous.
1766061	1768402	Yeah, if you haven't looked into Blue Sky yet, it's great.
1768742	1772122	You know, at least for now, I'm sure people will come in and ruin it later.
1772982	1782324	But we know the interesting thing about Blue Sky is it's built on a back end where like it's literally bought, built, excuse me, so the Elon Musk situation can't happen.
1782685	1784405	Nobody can come in and buy Blue Sky.
1784445	1789586	And even if they did, everybody can take because it's all built on that app protocol thing.
1789906	1792567	You could take what's built there and move it to another infrastructure.
1793327	1793547	Easy.
1794529	1803555	It's kind of like Mastodon a lot in that way, except a little more centralized than Mastodon was, which solves the problem of being easier to use.
1804095	1807137	So yeah, I would really encourage people to look into that website.
1807177	1813140	But also at the same time, it's not like Blue Sky is some big bubble that is problem-free.
1813260	1820004	No, all the regular problems in social media are still going to be there, but it's just you have more tools and just less noise.
1820304	1822406	Again, the problem with X is that
1823206	1826928	If you pay Elon Musk money, you can get your replies boosted to the top.
1827328	1835251	And he pays people based on the ad revenue, people to write stupid clickbait, engaging shit, not just in their posts, but in the comments.
1835451	1836952	And it's just things to get elevated.
1837092	1837332	There's a...
1839096	1840798	X is built to be an echo chamber.
1841418	1842720	Yeah, you want to hear a funny story.
1842780	1854231	So when our friends recently got married, or she got remarried, and her brother, he is a photographer.
1854251	1856833	He does a lot of that, like...
1858309	1863273	It's like astronomy, but it's like a lot of like pictures of the night sky.
1863433	1867756	Like he's got a telescope, takes a lot of pictures with his telescope and posts them on there.
1868076	1869477	And he's got a very big account.
1869537	1871558	It's like 300,000 followers now.
1871878	1876702	He's like, yeah, on the posts I get the most traction on are the ones that are like kind of
1877202	1903044	Open up and then someone starts having like this flat earth like starts arguing back and forth like the most toxic stuff ever but he just gets paid so much for it not that he's contributing to any of that he's just posting pictures of stars you know and stuff like that but but people that are on there just like churning all that stuff is like get all the ad views and he makes tons of money off of that stuff yeah he's like yeah it's it's it's gross but it's a living
1904326	1906687	S. Jonah and Matt says, avoid giving X any engagements.
1906707	1909388	That owner had a direct hand and all of this is cheap propagandist.
1909408	1909388	100,000%.
1909548	1912509	Oh, he's still going to be on the cabinet, too.
1912849	1914630	He's going to be in charge of, like, what is it?
1915150	1917430	He's going to probably be in charge of the FCC and stuff.
1917491	1919011	In charge of giving himself more money.
1920351	1920552	Yep.
1921452	1921732	Anyway.
1923563	1928067	Ah, tangent, but I'm also not going to apologize for the way I feel.
1928167	1933952	I think there's too many streamers out there that's like, I don't want to get political because I might risk her alienating people.
1934372	1935053	I don't give a fuck.
1935694	1936414	Be alienated.
1936995	1937775	Guess how I feel.
1938656	1939937	Do you think I don't feel alienated?
1941078	1941779	I don't give a fuck.
1944761	1948564	It's very popular to say on the other side, fuck your feelings.
1949125	1951427	It doesn't really feel good when it goes the other way, does it?
1952898	1953999	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1981038	2005479	I played mostly Minecraft and I've been you know working on the theme park stuff so I posted a video earlier this week talking about like some of the new rides I got the boardwalk all done so I had a couple mini games that I put together and all that stuff and inspiration for those and so I have another one that I just made um as well and I was working on some other things with that uh we were talking we had a meeting today so we were talking like
2006119	2010684	what's going on for next season and wrapping things up because we're going to be ending
2013052	2016975	Soon, like December sometime, probably by the end of the year.
2017776	2020398	And then we're gonna have a month off and then start in February.
2021278	2022479	Hopefully I can get done by then.
2022619	2024361	I'm taking two weeks off next week.
2024441	2029625	So I'm going to, well, I'm taking it off to work on Minecraft stuff.
2029965	2032767	Like, cause I have this giant water ride.
2032787	2035129	In your creative space for a little while.
2035569	2038572	I have tomorrow off and I'll probably work on videos and stuff too.
2038592	2038632	So.
2039318	2040160	That's a good call out.
2052714	2063277	I do play mindless stuff, so unfortunately one of our cast members got me somewhat hooked on Farm Merge Valley.
2063297	2068898	It's just this awful... It's the most mobile of mobile games.
2070558	2073779	It's completely a time waster, no brain whatsoever.
2074139	2080501	But it's what I've used to decompress from work, so I'll usually play 30 minutes of that to kind of just...
2081161	2087604	Turn My Brain Off, and then once my brain is off or de-stressed from work, then I go into working on Minecraft stuff.
2088124	2090806	So I've been doing a lot of that type of stuff.
2091746	2096188	And yeah, I'm pretty far in that too, because I've been playing it a lot.
2097048	2098849	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
2100810	2102211	I don't think I've really played anything else.
2103091	2105472	No, like I said, I tried out the AI in Minecraft thing.
2105612	2106213	It was pretty dumb.
2106633	2109534	I got bored with that pretty much after one time.
2111671	2135936	I'm looking to start new projects you know especially with next season coming up and then hopefully in between things I would looking to do that to just do like a single player series or something so I can get back into playing Minecraft just for fun or not just for fun but like with more fun you're you're more content that's focused on playing Minecraft than just building things especially this season's kind of ended up like last season where it's just like
2137188	2148788	a lot of like prep stuff and then it's like rush rush rush rush at the end and just build a ton of stuff at the end and that's kind of I was trying to avoid that this season and I fell right back into it again so
2150283	2169209	we'll see what next season happens I think you bring up a really good point though about like you know sometimes especially when you're a content creator you have to play games just to have fun right because that's how you get burned out otherwise if it's always like a work work work mentality so I think that's a really good idea to just have a little fun with it and you know remind yourself why you enjoy the game so much and create content for it
2169529	2184842	it's a good idea yeah it's just it's yeah kind of going back and forth with different things and different audiences like to watch some people just like to watch people play Minecraft or or take it a bit slower um which is fine we don't have the luxury to do that when we have a timed time
2185362	2197327	Season, so the season's a bit longer than normal, but it typically runs for about a year, so I kind of, if I'm looking to do these very large-scale projects, I have to hit the ground running, like, fast.
2197387	2199208	I'm just a sprint the entire time.
2199708	2211673	And if something holds me up, like in the case of this water ride, which designing it is... It's been months already, been in the design process for this, and it's... I mean, I gotta get... This is...
2212233	2213134	do or die time.
2213174	2222768	I have to get it done within these two weeks or it's just it's probably going to extend past the end of the season, you know, so we'll see, though.
2222828	2223790	I've got a lot to do.
2223910	2227035	You have the next two weeks off, but then isn't Thanksgiving the week after that?
2228424	2229285	Well, right.
2229345	2230947	So it's not the next two.
2230967	2235874	So this week I have work, and then it's week before Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving week.
2235894	2236394	Okay, okay.
2236414	2236955	That makes sense.
2237736	2238577	Yeah, yeah.
2238637	2239799	I mean, that would be even better, though.
2239819	2243704	If you're taking two weeks, then it's like you work, what, like three days, and then you have another two days off.
2243724	2244765	Yeah, it would be nice.
2244825	2246527	Unfortunately, our...
2247288	2250949	Department would fall apart because, yeah, it's all that.
2251470	2260633	I was still waiting to see, you know, because one of the things that we're voting on in California was the minimum wage to go up, so that'd be kind of nice if my minimum exempt wage would go up again.
2260653	2262814	Is that the only way I get raises around here?
2264579	2266460	10 years of experience, get paid minimum wage.
2266500	2267300	That sounds great.
2267880	2269101	Great deal.
2269661	2273142	Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
2273823	2274223	Let's see.
2274303	2276884	Some folks talking about that they're playing the Castlevania Collection.
2277924	2280825	And then, Loki, your channel got a shout out there.
2281505	2282666	Oh, thank you.
2284260	2285141	Let's talk about my game of the week.
2303357	2329407	at least for now I still have those rights to be able to do that and you know unless the constitution goes completely to hell I should be able to continue to do that to my heart's content as should all of you and it's because of veterans who you know ensure that our interests are withheld so yes thank you Ranma I know you're a veteran I don't know who else in chat specifically is so thank you and I'm sorry I forget in the moment but I'm sure we have folks out there listening as well
2330148	2333996	who aren't as active in chat or just kind of lurking on the podcast and what have you.
2334056	2335138	So thank you as well.
2336160	2336822	Really appreciate that.
2338820	2339560	My Gaming Week.
2339640	2345902	Okay, since we're talking YouTube channels, I have one too where I do retro gameplays and I did a video for, what did I do?
2346243	2352065	Mr. Do was on the Atari 2600, which is a very interesting sort of arcade translation.
2352365	2364069	I guess this was a week of 80s arcade translations because I did Donkey Kong on Monday as well for the Atari 2600, which it's interesting to see all the corners they cut to make both these games fit in the size of an Atari 2600 cartridge.
2365129	2370594	It really makes you appreciate how hard those programmers really worked to squeeze things down to fit into a cartridge.
2370654	2375638	But boy, especially in Mr. Do, it's like the screen draws only two-thirds of the screen.
2375899	2376499	Maybe three-fourths.
2376519	2382224	I was going to say, I don't think... I never played the 2600 version, just the Coleco version, and that one was pretty good.
2382244	2382685	But 2600...
2384426	2389270	Yeah, they make a lot of concessions, but it's not as bad as Pac-Man.
2389610	2393073	It's interesting because I was noticing this in Donkey Kong as well.
2393553	2400959	Especially to somebody who's a lot younger, a kid, you get the essence of what the game was.
2401319	2402340	Like in Donkey Kong...
2402780	2406804	When you see that first level, that's an iconic level, that first level in Donkey Kong, right?
2406824	2410427	With the pink, you know, construction, you know, lines and all that stuff.
2410747	2412889	You know, you recognize that when you see it.
2413049	2416952	And Atari 2600 Donkey Kong kind of translates that best it can.
2417593	2420135	And you're able to sort of see that.
2420995	2423137	And then Mr. Dew, they kind of tried to do the same thing.
2423217	2425358	Pac-Man, they had to cut too many corners.
2426159	2426999	And so it looks a little weird.
2427059	2429361	Anyway, I only did the two videos this week.
2429401	2432283	I was supposed to do a third, but I wasn't feeling it Tuesday night.
2432343	2433124	Can't imagine why.
2433944	2434384	But I did.
2434504	2436806	I also posted a Diablo 4 gameplay video.
2437146	2437947	Just a random thing.
2437967	2440268	I was like, I wonder what kind of traction this will get.
2440729	2441309	And guess what?
2442050	2444571	Got more traction than anything else I've posted in the last month.
2444972	2445172	So...
2446380	2448142	I might have to do some more Diablo 4 videos.
2448182	2448502	We'll see.
2448542	2450344	But I've been playing quite a bit of that as well.
2451866	2454649	And still some more Final Fantasy XIV.
2455090	2457973	I also played the opening hours of Dragon Age The Veil Guard.
2458574	2460436	I played about three hours of that on stream.
2461096	2463279	And, you know, it's still early.
2463379	2465221	I've heard a lot of complaints about the story.
2465281	2467363	And I do see things where it's like...
2467984	2468584	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2487734	2489715	Graphically, it looks really good.
2490276	2494418	And I like the combat so far.
2494559	2495799	It's actually really satisfying.
2496160	2506146	So there's a part of me that's like, honestly, if the next Mass Effect is done very similarly to this, like if it's in the same engine, I'm really hyped about it, to be quite honest.
2507087	2509709	I think that is really, really awesome.
2509989	2510209	Yeah.
2512500	2520262	But yeah, so so far I feel pretty good about Dragon Age, but I'll need to dive more into it to really know about the story and everything else.
2520362	2523283	But yeah, RecordWN says, I like the way that game looks.
2523323	2523923	Yeah, me too.
2524103	2525264	I liked it as well.
2525904	2533446	Bonds006 says, did not serve, but did two years of Army ROTC right out of high school, Reserve Office Training Corps.
2533566	2535586	Well, reserve is important as well.
2536567	2537327	And yeah.
2537907	2541009	So anyway, what else did I play this week?
2541169	2541750	I think that's it.
2542350	2543191	And it's all the big ones.
2544331	2546333	And then I mentioned the little party I went to.
2546453	2548334	Oh, the other game I'll mention that I played at the party.
2548754	2550576	Because I had yet to use this.
2552277	2554618	They had Taiko no Tatsujin on the PlayStation 4.
2555519	2559061	And I've played it because it was on Xbox Game Pass for a hot minute.
2559322	2560763	But they actually had the drum controller.
2560883	2564105	And I had yet to use a drum controller in a very long time.
2564465	2565206	And so that was fun.
2565306	2574552	Yeah, I was like, oh, I wish I could justify spending, thinking I would put enough hours into this game to justify the cost of this.
2574672	2575993	But I don't think I could.
2576033	2579756	But I enjoyed getting to kind of play the game with the controller again.
2579796	2580496	It's super cute.
2580596	2581257	I love Tycho.
2581317	2582477	It's such a cute little game.
2583718	2583978	All right.
2584899	2585680	Let's move on then.
2585720	2589222	If that's our Gaming Weeks, let's talk about some other headlines.
2589362	2590303	And we'll go to you, Loki.
2591104	2597153	Yeah, we got some more details regarding that whole PowWorld lawsuit from Nintendo.
2597734	2602882	So, you know, like we talked about before, there's... You would think it was about...
2603837	2605398	The designs of the pals.
2605598	2606498	But no, it's not.
2606738	2614622	It is about different systems that Nintendo has patented, which have some interesting dates to them.
2615142	2616703	So there's three.
2617303	2621144	So Pocket Pair has come out basically talking about the whole lawsuit and everything.
2621345	2631129	And basically that the company, they want 10 million yen from Pocket Pair to
2632011	2635833	between the two violations.
2636253	2640156	So part of it's going to Nintendo and the other is to the Pokemon company.
2640956	2645078	Now, I've watched some kind of analysis of this.
2645439	2655304	The idea, I think, that they're trying to do is to set precedent that they can sue these companies and have them pay them for these violations.
2656165	2658246	So here's where we come into some problems.
2659273	2664314	One, these patents were registered after Palworld was released.
2665774	2670015	These patents are for gameplay that's very generic.
2670615	2680877	So the first patent has to do with a system where a player aims and fires an item towards a character in the field and doing so triggers combat.
2683237	2685858	And then they talk about also capturing mobs with that.
2686038	2686758	Also, they said...
2688223	2690965	The ability to capture Pokemon in the wild.
2691485	2695068	And then there is one that was rather only during battle.
2695528	2703753	And then the third was to some modification requiring it basically allowing you to switch mounts in game pretty easily.
2706025	2734187	and so all of these patents were registered so they applied for the patent like the first one was applied for July 30th 2024 registered August 27th 2024 well after PAL World was out the next one February 26th May 22nd was the one that was registered March 5th July 26th so these have been released well after the game came out so it's almost like saying
2735011	2759570	you know, hypothetically speaking I'm going to patent the idea of the Triforce I'm going to patent the Triforce and I'm going to sue Nintendo despite the fact that they've had games with the Triforce in it or whatever this symbology for like a long time it makes no sense and it seems very frivolous
2760418	2763840	The problem is, you know, Pocket Pair is a smaller company.
2763940	2769084	Granted, they are a smaller company that has now a lot of money from the sales of this.
2769544	2774467	But even still, to fight Nintendo on this, they could drag this out for a very long time.
2775368	2775428	In
2776926	2783009	What should have happened is I don't think that these patents should have been given to Nintendo in the first place.
2783710	2790574	Especially if they're trying to patent things that are already existing and it's very generic, the gameplay.
2790794	2799418	And in fact, if you want to even argue, I mean, granted, Nintendo's had capturing Pokemon for a while now in other games.
2800519	2805522	Granted, I think Arceus was the first one that they actually did more of a in-the-wild
2806621	2834713	but the previous game that Pocket Pair released actually had that type of gameplay already in it prior to I think Legends Arceus so I don't know yeah Nintendo's kind of losing me here because I just like if you're going to go after something go after the design of the creatures that's the biggest thing that sticks out to me like I don't understand why this isn't an argument about that especially with all the merchandise maybe it's a way to like
2835273	2837874	Get Discovery so that they can figure that out?
2838415	2839415	I don't know.
2839575	2839955	I don't know.
2840396	2847099	You know, there's a couple ways, and I'm looking at the comments in chat, and SHO100Matt points out 10 million yen is $65,000, roughly.
2847499	2848720	So yeah, it's weird.
2849160	2853562	It's not exactly a ton of money that's going to shut down, you know, the PAL world, folks.
2853862	2857044	But yeah, SHO100Matt continues, this feels more like a shakedown than anything.
2857384	2863147	Nintendo is hoping the pocket pair will settle so they don't have to deal with Nintendo's lawyers drying this out for years and costing them money.
2863567	2869052	The only other thing I can think of, and I know this is a long shot, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that...
2871007	2872528	Maybe this is a defensive maneuver.
2872828	2881294	I know that sounds really weird, but we know all these things that they are getting patents on sound like things that are part of Pokemon Legends, specifically, right?
2881694	2884636	Like the throwing an item to engage in battle, that's a Legends thing.
2884916	2887057	Changing mounts, that's a Legends thing.
2887378	2893642	So part of me wonders if they aren't trying to put these into place to have...
2894864	2895724	I don't think that they would-
2921378	2933889	it's really weird and it's also like if they were going to why wait until after your game is released to then like well after your game is released to patent these things
2934605	2935326	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2953227	2954810	We can keep making it up, but we don't know.
2954950	2957414	And there's obviously a million different ways this could be going.
2958336	2960198	So it'll be fascinating to see after the fact.
2960379	2964145	But at the same time, it's also very likely that Pocket Pair does settle.
2964425	2966749	And then the terms of the settlement, can't talk about it.
2967069	2967851	So we'll never know.
2969448	2975810	It says all three patents are successful requests to modify previously established patents.
2976550	2980152	It says each notably designed to match newer features.
2980232	2986754	So I guess they have had other things patented, but now they're kind of bringing it more to the current.
2987354	2994777	Still, I don't think that still applies, though, even if they did have a patent for capturing Pokemon in battle or something like that.
2994877	2995077	Yeah.
2996175	2996695	Tough shit.
2996775	2999176	Now they did something different and you want to patent it.
2999256	2999616	Sorry.
3000216	3000657	I'm sorry.
3000697	3007019	You're just gonna... First off, let's, like, I mean, patent reform needs to happen across the world anyways.
3007239	3009239	You shouldn't be able to patent game mechanics.
3009399	3009900	Period.
3010000	3012500	Like, anything should not be patentable.
3012520	3018102	If you want to, you know, copyright your characters and your scenarios and all that type of stuff, that's fine.
3018162	3019923	But patenting game mechanics?
3020383	3020563	No.
3020703	3022264	That should be thrown out right away.
3023024	3023144	Um...
3025014	3026696	It's ridiculous, this type of stuff.
3027476	3032881	We go back to the whole Namco patenting the ability to play minigames while loading.
3033281	3040387	Granted, load screens are not really a thing anymore, but we never got to live in a world that had those because they fucked it up for everybody else.
3040627	3043810	Or at least the patents should expire a lot quicker.
3043970	3044831	Yeah, 20 years.
3046872	3053174	Yeah, it needs to be a lot quicker, because the Namco loading screen thing, that expired now, so people can do it, but you're right, there's really no loading screens anymore.
3053414	3056555	How long ago was Pokemon released?
3056875	3058996	Oh god, Pokemon was like the late 90s.
3059756	3060376	Late 90s.
3060656	3066318	So are they altering these patents so they can keep the patent on the whole Pokeball throwing thing?
3066498	3067398	Because it's been over 20 years?
3069571	3069832	Maybe.
3070973	3072817	It's been closer to 30 years, Loki.
3073037	3076283	I mean, right, but it's like they tweaked it before or something like that.
3076343	3077364	I don't know.
3077405	3077945	We'll never know.
3078186	3078647	We'll never know.
3078887	3079328	We'll never know.
3080217	3084500	Um, before I get to the next story though, I should point out, I have to say something about this at some point.
3084820	3088102	There are some things apparently we do know here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3088303	3091925	And, uh, I don't know if you remember, but we were talking about Nintendo music last week.
3091965	3093046	You remember this on the show?
3093486	3100591	And I was saying, I swear to God, I remember talking on OLR about this and saying that this is like, this is a thing that Nintendo should do.
3101792	3102572	And guess what?
3102732	3103313	Guess what?
3104286	3105367	Somebody found the clip.
3106027	3108309	So 13XForever, kudos to you.
3108629	3110710	And I'm betting dimes to dollars.
3110750	3115874	It's because 13XForever wrote that transcription thing that went through and transcribed all the episodes of our show.
3116274	3119676	So I'm betting he just searched and found the episode we were talking about it in.
3120177	3128002	Actually found that in episode 901 from January 30th of 2022, I said the following.
3128042	3130424	And sorry, Loki, you're not going to hear this, but I'm going to play this for listeners.
3133044	3133524	Here we go.
3134905	3143428	I mean, every streaming service out there, you name it, has at least like orchestral versions, covers, remixes, and things that are a lot harder for Nintendo to touch.
3144048	3149411	But yeah, the originals, it's really, really, they don't want that for whatever reason.
3149771	3153092	QuestBuster in chat says, to be honest, I'm surprised it took this long.
3153252	3153873	Kind of same.
3154453	3158014	Also, I wish Nintendo gave us more options to actually buy their music.
3158295	3159275	Yes, definitely.
3159635	3162757	And that's what I'm hearing in the YouTube channel owner's comments.
3163718	3165379	That's what the frustration is.
3166000	3168261	At least put the music up on streaming services then.
3168341	3171484	Or if you think the streaming services don't pay enough, you know what?
3171644	3175747	Put it on part of the Nintendo Online subscription.
3175887	3177328	A Nintendo Music Player.
3179369	3180790	Oh my god, what a novel idea.
3181050	3184171	Okay, sure, it's going to take a little bit of development time to build that.
3184431	3185111	But you know what?
3185811	3187032	I don't think it would take a ton.
3187132	3189453	And there's going to be a lot of people that would be super into that.
3190173	3197336	How many of you would be down for a Nintendo music player as a part of your online Switch membership?
3197356	3200677	Technically, they've already kind of got one in Smash Bros.
3200797	3202697	Yes, I see Bobby Blackwell pointing that out.
3202777	3205538	But y'all know that's a little different.
3205699	3205979	Because A...
3207619	3211502	It's a very comprehensive, but it's not all-encompassing.
3212763	3215486	And B, it is kind of buried away in the game.
3215906	3217087	But I get it.
3217207	3217607	I get it.
3217707	3220349	Yes, there is a lot of the music in Smash Bros.
3221910	3224773	Why don't they take that out and put it on Nintendo Online?
3224813	3225113	I don't know.
3226826	3227447	So there you go.
3227867	3231171	And so yes, I have to stroke my ego just a little bit here on this program.
3231791	3234014	And here's why.
3234414	3235615	I'm going to break this down for you.
3235735	3238458	If it sounds like Rob has an ego, it's actually not that.
3238478	3241261	But I'm going to tell you why when shit like that happens, I'm going to rub it in.
3242042	3242743	Because...
3244053	3261873	in this industry a lot of times these larger gaming websites tend to go to these investor people that have these ideas and there's one in particular I'm thinking of but I'm not going to name names because I'm a nice person that always has these things to say that don't make any sense at all and don't seem to be rooted in reality
3262914	3269979	Meanwhile, people like Loki, myself, and DarkSakura have been commenting on this industry for 20 years plus.
3270599	3276603	We like to have some sort of critical thinking when it comes to this stuff and evaluating this.
3277224	3278745	People don't take this seriously.
3279325	3285529	Even though we take what we do here in gaming and commenting, we have fun with it, sure, but we take it very seriously here.
3285889	3290973	But then I have to turn around and go to E3 and back in the day, yes, this is a little bit of sour grapes.
3291593	3300515	have to justify our existence on why we're getting to do something like this, and yet we're able to make these same types of predictions, and you know what?
3300555	3301975	Sometimes we get it really, really well.
3302936	3310337	And I'd like to think, I called that that was going to be, well, or said it should be Nintendo Online, which I don't think was something anybody else said.
3311177	3317659	I mean, if E3 still existed, we'd still go there, could show them the whole Guinness Book of World Records thing, and they'd be like,
3318447	3321068	Yeah, but Alexa rankings say this.
3321188	3322408	Yeah, I know, I know.
3322528	3327310	Anyway, DJ Ranma S says, okay, Rob, what's the Mega Millions numbers?
3329030	3332891	42, 69, 13, 420, hut, hut, hut.
3332911	3335232	Let's see.
3336172	3336672	This is funny.
3336732	3341173	Somebody had said, oh yeah, Fifth Dream says, Rob needs to sue Nintendo for infringement.
3341614	3342934	No, I think the whole thing is funny.
3344571	3345471	I think the whole thing's funny.
3345751	3349393	I'm not actually that worked out, but I think it's kind of funny.
3350753	3353194	I still stand by everything I said about Nintendo Music last week.
3353294	3361076	It's just kind of two years too late, so it's really funny that I said that then because that was the time for Nintendo to release it.
3363397	3363677	Anyway.
3365015	3367377	Alright, I'm done running my victory lap.
3367677	3369238	You knew I was going to say something, right, Loki?
3369499	3373241	As soon as you saw that clip hit the Discord, you knew I was going to say something, didn't you?
3373742	3375043	Yes, I did.
3376204	3376504	Alright.
3377628	3383609	Let's move on and talk about kind of a warning, I guess, for those of you that might need to pick up one of these adapters.
3383669	3393151	And I don't know what this might be saying about the future of this too, but let's talk about the free PlayStation 5 PlayStation camera adapter for PlayStation VR.
3393731	3397192	Sony is going to be stopping soon offering this adapter.
3397792	3401792	This is to allow you to connect your PlayStation camera to your PlayStation 5.
3402513	3404273	This is the camera that was released for the PS4.
3405053	3423366	and of course you had to have it to use the original PlayStation VR on the current console and then the HD camera isn't compatible with the original PlayStation VR so you needed this if you wanted to play the original PSVR through the system and all that stuff because the VR systems are very very different
3424423	3428887	So as of November 26th, the PlayStation Camera Adapter will no longer be available.
3428967	3430709	That is set on a Sony support page.
3431590	3437275	You can still request an adapter via a form or you can call Sony to get that.
3437616	3441840	You have to have a serial number from the processing unit of the PSVR to get it.
3441940	3445223	But remember, PSVR games do not run on the PSVR 2 platform.
3446264	3455934	This is just things that are available on the original PSVR, but to be able to play them on your PS5 because PS5 is backwards compatible with PlayStation 4.
3457195	3460418	And of course, when I hear something like that, I'm kind of two mindsets.
3461499	3464442	One, the clock could have run out on it and it's just, you know, whatever.
3464522	3468426	But two, I'm kind of like, is this a sign that maybe the PlayStation VR...
3469860	3472060	is kind of like they're just kind of walking away from it.
3472100	3481102	I mean, I realize this particular adapter doesn't really have anything to do with the VR2, but it just kind of makes me go like, what is Sony's thing on VR right now?
3481382	3482322	Where does Sony stand with VR?
3482342	3484143	I think they already are walking away from it.
3484203	3496885	I thought we had like some other like some story about it because I remember vaguely that they were kind of like just done with it or that it's not they're not really pushing it.
3497759	3501301	and that, you know, kind of opening it up for PC now use.
3503541	3504242	But I don't know.
3504422	3504762	We'll see.
3505522	3505922	That's true.
3505982	3508123	There was the whole PC use thing and that's, yeah.
3508864	3516507	But yeah, I wish I could have been convinced to buy a PlayStation 5 VR or PlayStation VR 2.
3516547	3520588	These numbering, naming things get so weird, which is another problem probably.
3520608	3526051	But I wish I could have been convinced to get a PlayStation VR 2, but I just, I didn't see that must have thing that I got to get.
3526551	3526671	So.
3527611	3527931	I don't know.
3529092	3530332	Alright, well, moving on.
3530953	3534294	Loki, this is a... More lawsuits from Nintendo!
3534314	3538316	This is a FAFO story, a fuck-around-find-out story, if you were wondering what that is.
3538336	3541078	This is just a stupid story is what it is.
3541498	3543499	This is just dumb things.
3543579	3553744	So, apparently, there was this guy, Jesse Keenan, who likes to stream Nintendo Switch games before they were released.
3555010	3581810	and uh you know basically quoting Captain America I can do this all day and then they um filed a lawsuit against him so he uh apparently was leaking Switch games including um Mario and Luigi Brothership uh using emulation and I'm assuming a pirated copy of said game because why else would you be using emulation to play the games early um
3582768	3607005	and of course you know they are saying that he is promoting piracy because he's probably pirating the games before they came out um and then uh yeah so now he is in a lawsuit and then still trolling the company saying you know love y'all capitalism is cancer my channel's being deleted for sharing gameplay videos this is your reward um
3608248	3608548	and DarkSakura.
3628294	3654502	yeah that's kind of on you yeah there's the Nintendo lawsuits that don't make sense and then there's like the one we were talking about and then there's the Nintendo lawsuit that you go yep that makes sense that's that's what we have here so like you know don't be so brazen with this stuff some people really think they're invincible some people really think they're invincible but um when it comes to Nintendo's legal team like fuck around and find out right
3655765	3656525	Kind of, yeah.
3656765	3659806	So maybe don't, like, I mean, what's the point?
3659946	3665388	Like, what possible gains are you going to have from streaming that gameplay early?
3665448	3672090	Like, yeah, you may get some more views on your live streams and stuff like that, but are you really going to make up enough money to make that worth it?
3672130	3675171	Like, it just doesn't seem like it's a smart plan altogether.
3675551	3680033	Because they're probably not just coming for that damages, but they'll probably want to take any money that he has made.
3680441	3686682	Well, yeah, they are $150,000 in damages for each instance of alleged copyright infringement.
3687363	3697305	And so that he has, I guess, done this as many as 50 times in the last two years.
3700045	3702026	So, yeah, $7.5 million.
3702046	3702126	Yeah.
3704967	3724809	stick to emulating the games that are no longer available or just like if you want to play games early just do that on your own and not go hey guys look what I'm doing look at the crimes I'm committing you know like it's it's so stupid yeah it is very like TikTok of somebody committing a crime and that whole thing and wondering why they get in trouble yeah it's very that it's very that
3725632	3726633	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3741472	3745253	Nvidia is going to be adding a playtime cap to GeForce Now.
3745673	3749274	That is going to be starting next year, so starting January 1st, 2025.
3749714	3758297	If you are a new GeForce Now subscriber, you will only be able to play for up to 100 hours every month before you have to pay for additional playtime.
3758897	3764539	But in thinking in Jamie's case here, you know, she's been pretty active on this and I know she streams using this service.
3764919	3769041	She was a supporter of cloud-based streaming back when it was Google Stadia, right?
3769601	3776504	So if you signed up before December 31st, 2024, you won't see your usage capped until 2026, right?
3777884	3778424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3794457	3798019	They say, well, the average person uses this.
3798639	3805862	And then it turns out, you know, 100 hours, if you divide that up amongst 30 days in a month, it's a little over, what, three hours a day?
3806242	3807703	Which sounds like a lot, yes.
3807763	3813186	But I'm thinking, like, in Jamie's case, she does, like, five or six hour streams a couple times a week, right?
3813646	3815487	So I'm like, she might get there.
3815927	3818628	But that's, again, I can't speak for her because she's not here tonight to give her opinion.
3818648	3819649	So I'll ask her about it next week.
3819689	3822170	But I'm sure it's just one of those things where it's like,
3824378	3832145	I feel like people are not raving about this service and this little PR stunt is not going to do it any favors.
3832966	3838792	And I wonder if when you talk about capping the hours, but if you sign up by the end of the year, you'll get a whole other year free.
3839232	3842135	I don't think that's going to drive subscribership the way you think it's going to.
3842628	3858537	And you know what's great about this, too, is the fact that, you know, cutting the stream time down or whatever like this, how much money is that really going to save for the most profitable company in the world?
3859238	3866342	You know, like, they've beaten Intel as, you know, one of the biggest, you know, hardware companies out there, like...
3867600	3869521	I'm sorry, you're not doing bad at all.
3869781	3870942	You have tons of money.
3871402	3875645	Like, there's no reason that these should be implemented this way.
3875705	3881268	But I mean, I guess it's a cost cutting measure because infinite profits got to keep those shareholders happy.
3881548	3884930	Keep boosting that stock because their stock is so high already.
3886124	3893507	Now, to be in the interest of fairness and covering all sides, I will say for NVIDIA, there are some other changes, and maybe some of these would be welcomed.
3893647	3900809	So the priority tier is getting renamed, and now it's called Performance, and it will now stream at 1440 pixels as opposed to 1080p.
3902330	3925802	so it is going to be an upgrade in the visual quality of it so there is that and if you're already paying for what's called priority you are getting moved to this performance tier and now I guess there's going to be an ultimate on top of that so ultimate is going to be 4k and 120 frames per second and I think that's what like I don't know how much that costs oh $19.99 a month
3928061	3933646	What kind of internet connection do you need for 240 frames per second in 4K?
3934126	3935187	You'd be surprised.
3935227	3937088	My fibers could.
3937168	3941532	I don't know if I could get that many frames, but I can get 4K YouTubes easy.
3942112	3942412	Easy.
3942753	3943593	And they look really good.
3943854	3944814	Well, right.
3945055	3947516	4K YouTube, I understand, but I don't know.
3947877	3947897	I...
3950262	3953225	It seems like it's pie-in-the-sky nonsense.
3953265	3953505	Yeah.
3953905	3958548	Well, it's getting faster and faster because I remember when we moved in here, they were like, do you want the one gigabit fiber?
3958989	3961270	We have up to five gigabit fiber in your area.
3961831	3963292	And it's like, you probably don't need that much.
3963312	3967415	Yeah, we have the one gigabit, and it is more than perfect for us.
3967675	3971478	And it's so much better than what we had with Comcast.
3971878	3975481	It's gone down one time in the two years we've lived here, and it was down for maybe an hour and a half.
3976446	3977728	and Constance.
3977768	3977969	I know.
3978009	3978369	I'm sorry.
3978409	3981554	I feel like I'm rubbing it in, but I'm just to all the people out there.
3981614	3982195	It gets better.
3984184	3987085	Just wait for other companies to offer fiber in your area.
3987145	3987685	It gets better.
3987825	3988166	Oh, yeah.
3988286	3992447	I'm just waiting with bated breath for, like, my monopoly to be broken.
3992507	3993808	Yeah, I'm sure that's going to happen.
3993988	3994728	Oh, that's right.
3994928	3995729	We voted against that.
3995749	3996789	Comcast and we have AT&T.
3996929	4000450	AT&T is like, we're high speed.
4000771	4001211	No, no.
4001291	4004072	They can't use high speed anymore because it's illegal for them to use that.
4004392	4005032	They are.
4005672	4006053	Oh, God.
4006093	4008294	What was the terminology that they use?
4008374	4009154	Ultra fast, I think.
4009966	4011387	Yeah, it's like ultra-fast internet.
4011427	4012867	It's like, shut up.
4013367	4014268	Like, come on.
4014968	4019569	I'm sorry, 60 megabits down is not ultra-fast, my guy.
4019930	4025191	I will say, AT&T is the company we use, but yeah, it's fiber.
4025371	4026692	It's one gig up, one gig down.
4026752	4028313	Like, it's, yeah, very fast.
4029013	4029173	So...
4030356	4039699	And you'll notice, remember, for those that have been listening to OLR for a very long time, the only time technology issues have shut down the show was power-related.
4039859	4041340	It was not internet-related.
4041480	4043061	Internet issues have never shut down the show.
4044081	4046622	And power, honestly, it's been pretty good.
4047502	4048402	Yeah.
4048462	4050403	Yeah, because we're currently on PG&E, or at least...
4053120	4057684	But yeah, it seems like it's always someone running into a telephone pole or wind.
4057784	4058624	Yeah, wind.
4059245	4061927	Well, not here, because it's all underground.
4062787	4068252	Yeah, well, our neighborhood is, but everywhere around our neighborhood is not, so...
4069815	4073759	Anyway, we'll check in with Jamie on her thoughts on the NVIDIA issue next week.
4073859	4079824	But yeah, I mean, at least the quality is going to get better, but I'm curious if that's really good enough for that play cap.
4079844	4085709	But again, you can pay, I think it was like $3 for an additional 10 hours, but that's going to add up pretty quick.
4085869	4088371	So anyway, we'll see.
4088452	4091855	Well, meanwhile, Loki, let's see what's going on in your neck of the woods with our next headline.
4092619	4109123	Speaking of quality, the Chief Operations Officer who oversees Sony PlayStation Business has made some comments during their earnings call talking about what's happened with Concord, for example.
4109263	4114424	And they've promised that there's going to be some better quality checks after Concord.
4114924	4116025	TheFailureOfConcord.
4116645	4129735	Currently we're still in the process of learning and basically with that regards to IP you don't know the result until you actually try it or maybe listen to your fans beforehand when they said it looks awful and don't release it like this and you're like nope full speed ahead.
4130476	4140203	So for us our reflection probably will need to have a lot of gates including user testing and user evaluation and timings of such gates to we need to bring them forward and
4140943	4169072	we should have done those much earlier on so in other words basically like more frequent tests and you know pivot early instead of going all in and all that stuff going forward our first party titles and third party titles we do have many different windows so we want to be able to select right an optimal window we can deploy to our own platform without cannibalization so we can maximize performance and teams of the title launches um
4171075	4176940	Yeah, I mean, I don't know if they're going to continue to make these types of mistakes.
4177080	4178781	I don't see them doing that.
4179121	4186327	But then again, I also feel that this wasn't like unknown that Concord was going to flop.
4187128	4190671	This statement really is like this statement really reeks of trust me, bro.
4192072	4194514	It doesn't it's like I feel like I mean, bro.
4195467	4197788	Yeah, what are you supposed to tell the investors?
4197828	4198569	Yeah, we fucked up.
4198949	4200590	We really didn't know what we were releasing.
4201610	4203952	We trusted them and they didn't do it.
4205192	4215078	S2100 Matt in chat says, Oh please, the teams were warning them and probably telling them don't release this but your board pushed us out.
4215098	4215078	100%.
4215138	4218720	So who on the board is being let go to really demonstrate?
4218740	4220701	Does action speak louder than words?
4221670	4222550	who on the board?
4223791	4244501	nobody, just the team at Firework how dare they release a game in this state that we totally knew that we knew and they told us we take the lessons learned from Concord and will continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area stop it stop
4245458	4246279	That's what you need to do.
4246839	4255464	Live service, you know, whenever we hear you talking about, like, expanding your live service, we hear, we're greedy motherfuckers and we want more of that fucking money is what we hear.
4255604	4257005	So, I don't know.
4257205	4257486	Agreed.
4257766	4257986	Agreed.
4259358	4268643	Alright, well, moving on to a game that is coming out, I think it's next week, we're getting a pretty fun release with Dragon Quest III, the HD 2D remake.
4268683	4275527	So we're getting a re-release of Dragon Quest III, I think for the second time, because I think we've already seen a remake of this game once.
4276407	4283911	But now we're getting another one that's going to be more in the engine that brought us things like Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy and all that stuff.
4284131	4284892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4303686	4311412	But Square Enix is saying we want spoiler warnings for any major plot details, which is wild because how old is Dragon Quest 3?
4311552	4312493	It's a very old game.
4312713	4313654	Most people know where it's going.
4314054	4322461	But also, you are not allowed to share the ending or the end post-ending until after the 13th of December.
4322921	4323442	In a quote...
4323942	4333628	When streaming scenes that are closely related to the game scenario, please voluntarily label them as contained spoilers so as to not spoil the enjoyment for those who are about to play the game.
4334328	4341073	Please refrain from live streaming the ending and post-ending gameplay following the final battle until December 13th.
4341453	4343414	Please refrain from posting videos or image.
4344395	4346016	Here's the thing about Dragon Quest III.
4346636	4347757	There wasn't a post-game.
4350018	4359128	because you can go look up the ending to the original game right now and you'll see in like most RPGs of its era, you beat the boss, you get some nice little graphical credits, the end.
4360170	4362212	Spoilers!
4362532	4364454	Yeah, screen is kind of showing something there.
4364534	4365596	Here's what I think it is.
4367179	4367819	Dragon Quest 3 HD Remake
4393115	4416674	and this was years ago this is two or three years ago so it's kind of like when the HD thing was announced it was like finally so my guess is at the end of all this is a trailer for either the Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D remake possible but we already know that's coming or and I think this is the real possibility and what for whatever reason they want to keep under wraps Dragon Quest 12
4417935	4420298	I think because we where's the information on Dragon Quest 12?
4421099	4423262	We haven't heard anything on this in a very long time.
4423782	4431752	So my guess is there is a Dragon Quest 12 trailer hint something at the end of all this that you get us a reward for beating the game.
4432493	4435176	And I mean, they think it's not going to release to the Internet.
4436778	4437178	Oh, honey.
4438459	4442422	Oh honey, that is going to get ripped from the files.
4442582	4448406	That will be on social media sites that are a lot harder to scrape and content match and all that.
4448866	4450487	That will be up there on day one.
4454610	4455331	But nice try.
4457012	4457252	Anyway.
4461533	4471415	I can respect the whole don't rip the trailer and put it on your own social media for the bait because we plan to put it on our own social media on December 13th and we want the clicks.
4472055	4473156	That's what this says to me.
4473716	4474616	You don't get the clicks.
4474796	4475476	I get the clicks.
4476456	4482037	Be very careful if you do this though, especially on YouTube because Square Enix will look for it and shut it down.
4482137	4483138	I guarantee it.
4484318	4489439	Anyway, since we're talking about classic games, I think this is a good transition into our next segment.
4500225	4507539	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4508000	4510544	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4511618	4517764	But unfortunately, DarkSakura is not able to dive into the gaming vault tonight because she is not here.
4518304	4523929	So we asked Loki to decide what should the classic game of the week be this week.
4524250	4526532	So Loki, what is the classic game of the week?
4527132	4530035	Classic game of the week is Excite Truck.
4531076	4532417	I was thinking there's no way.
4532477	4534219	You loved this fucking game.
4534479	4536301	You love this fucking game.
4537464	4538885	Our family loved this fucking game.
4538925	4540146	My wife loved this fucking game.
4540287	4540407	No.
4542008	4543229	It was a toss-up.
4543309	4546452	I was almost considering Grand Theft Auto V, but I was like, nah.
4547205	4548566	No, Excite Truck.
4548946	4549546	Excite Truck.
4549586	4550207	Excite Truck.
4550347	4550907	Excite Truck.
4552108	4561273	One of the best games, I think, in my opinion, on the Nintendo Wii, it was the third game in the Excite series.
4561313	4563294	Of course, you know, starting off with Excite Bike.
4563354	4565355	And then, of course, we had Excite Bike 64.
4566516	4569497	And then, of course, now Excite Truck, which was just awesome.
4570038	4573500	It had a unique control scheme that used the Wii remote.
4573540	4575801	And there were never any sequels to it at the end.
4577861	4607056	there was, we can talk about that we have to, okay some cool features though that weren't really in a lot of Wii games either because you may remember that Wii had an SD card slot and you could actually pop in an SD card with MP3s on there and replace the music in the game with your own music that's right, and it was awesome it was so cool you could put stuff from like Initial D and Wangan and shit in this game
4607438	4610194	and DDR Music.
4611002	4611722	It was great.
4611922	4613283	It was very cool.
4613683	4617404	And yeah, so it's not an easy game either.
4617484	4624446	So you have to race through the different tracks trying to get a high ranking, essentially.
4624486	4636350	And the way you do that is based off of the number of tricks you do, also the stunts, how fast you've completed the race, that type of stuff.
4636650	4637590	And getting...
4638710	4662415	S rank on all of the all of the difficulties basically unlocks harder difficulties where the AI is even harder so they have you know excite race which you get S's in that and then there's also super excite race which is even harder and then of course much like Mario Kart and all the other stuff mirror mode which mirrors the tracks and
4663559	4689533	also the rings that you have to pass through are smaller as well so it gets even harder then on top of that they also had challenge mode which allowed you to race through different gates rings and they have crush challenges and then super challenge which is an even harder version of that and then of course you know multiplayer versus you could play two players in that as well um
4690353	4699116	Some of the cool stuff, you know, they had, you know, some of the same physics, I guess, as our gameplay, the Excitebike stuff.
4699156	4706579	So your car, you know, you have like a boost and then your car could overheat, but water would cool that down as well as jumping really high into the air.
4707160	4710841	And then that caused the air to actually cool down your car.
4711161	4712302	They had these different...
4713888	4739499	basically icons or power-ups that you'd run over the map that would change the landscape so you'd have like all sorts of things happen like tornadoes would spawn in or trains or like a volcano would go off the land would just shift underneath you it was really cool and it could open up some different like shortcuts and like jumps and stuff like that but yeah really really awesome game
4741155	4746397	They did release a sequel, ExciteBots Trick Racing.
4747397	4754900	It kind of lost, they lost the spark of what made ExciteTruck good.
4754920	4757601	Number one, why the fuck was it ExciteBots in the first place?
4757641	4761043	You don't follow up ExciteBike and ExciteTruck with ExciteRobots.
4761083	4762123	Like, do you think we're all obsessed?
4762323	4766665	Like, it should have been ExciteCar, ExciteBoats, ExciteYacht.
4768279	4769402	Excite Covered Wagon
4778413	4781696	I don't even know if they're still around anymore, if they're still making games.
4781816	4784539	But yeah, it's been a while, 2009.
4785000	4786642	No, actually, no, they're still working on games.
4786722	4790866	So they just did World of Outlaws Dirt Racing, which was back on 2022.
4791287	4793089	Oh, so they're still making racing games.
4793129	4798174	They also did, crazy enough, the port of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D for the 3DS.
4799875	4800736	That's very random.
4800796	4802537	Apparently they do a lot of ports of different things.
4802937	4804958	Donkey Kong Country Returns, huh?
4805158	4805658	Interesting.
4805898	4807279	But they haven't done a game since 2022, huh?
4807319	4810341	Yeah, they haven't done a game since 2022.
4810601	4811101	You know why?
4811161	4816144	They were acquired by iRacing.com that year.
4816565	4818826	Out the window of any future Nintendo games.
4818846	4819386	That's too bad.
4819446	4820747	I'd love to see it in the same boat.
4822315	4847917	but I mean, Nintendo could do it I'm sure someone in-house could create a new Excite Truck game since they own the IP for it they did such a good job with this though or at the very least, please Nintendo just backwards compatible port that to the Switch or something it would be fantastic it really would but it's not to be but yep, Excite Truck one of the best games on the Wii
4848945	4849365	My opinion.
4849665	4850786	And a launch title at that.
4851486	4852287	And a launch title.
4852647	4853187	It was great.
4853528	4856529	Wait, the Wii had such a good launch, if you think about it.
4856970	4864314	Obviously, they sold a million of them, or millions and millions of them, but didn't it have like 18 games at launch?
4864334	4865855	It had a lot of games at launch.
4865875	4867275	It was a lot.
4867596	4867916	I think...
4868906	4872730	It was like, of course, Wii Sports, which pack in already.
4872830	4874631	I remember getting Trauma Center early on.
4874651	4875672	I had a Trauma Center game.
4875772	4877694	Trauma Center, Excite Truck.
4878615	4883119	I want to say there was Twilight Princess, which is big.
4884260	4888384	Also, I don't know if Red Steel was right away.
4888424	4890165	That might have been like a December game.
4890646	4892327	But Red Steel is pretty close.
4893348	4893689	Rabbids.
4893969	4894690	I thought I had this.
4894730	4895090	Hold on.
4899383	4900666	Trying to figure this out here.
4900766	4903132	Okay, when were these released?
4904275	4904917	Uh, okay.
4909222	4915447	So I'm looking at a chart of like every single Wii game that ever came out, but there was a lot of stuff that never came out in the U.S.
4915507	4916028	Okay, here we go.
4916428	4932941	There was an Avatar game, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenka Hashi 2, Excite Truck, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, GT Pro Series, Happy Feet, Zelda Twilight Princess, Madden 07, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
4933001	4933682	I forgot about that.
4934342	4950151	Monster 4x4, World Circuit, Need for Speed, Carbon, Rampage, Total Destruction, Rayman, Raving Rabbids, Red Steel, SpongeBob, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball, Banana Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center, Second Opinion, and Wii Sports.
4950511	4952132	All of those, November 19th, 2006.
4954353	4954794	Oh, that's right.
4954934	4957037	Now that I looked at the screenshot here.
4957077	4960802	So yeah, stars, you had to collect the number of stars in order to get a certain rank.
4961002	4971455	And so you get, you know, based on your placement and then smashing the cars and stuff like that, which the smashing the cars, it's almost like a burnout in a sense, the way you do that, but...
4972436	4987514	um yeah it was great game and it only enhanced by um you know putting your own music because the soundtrack was all right but your own music so much better like you know racing to pendulum and you
4988314	4993276	My wife used to listen to a lot of Justin Timberlake.
4993877	4995357	Oh my god, amazing.
4995617	4996198	That was great.
4996318	4996758	I love that.
4997038	5002721	Do you know, by the way, since I'm looking at the list, do you know what the last game ever released for the Wii was and when?
5003361	5005802	Guess when the last Wii game came out.
5005822	5007543	Don't cheat.
5007603	5011645	It's going to be Just Dance and it's probably like 20...
5016114	5016935	2020, maybe?
5017376	5017836	Look at you.
5017876	5018957	You've got to be looking at a list.
5019018	5019618	Yep, you're right.
5019758	5020099	I'm not.
5020159	5020760	I'm just guessing.
5020780	5021120	You're right.
5021180	5026026	Just Dance 2020, released in 2019, was the last Wii release.
5026186	5027408	Oh, Hawaii Shakedown.
5027908	5030872	Well, I mean, that's technically a digital game, but yeah.
5031312	5033052	Yeah, well, yeah, I should have said retail release.
5033092	5038093	But yeah, Just Dance, 2017, 18, 19, and 20 were all on the Wii.
5038233	5040254	Otherwise, they started drying up in about 2015.
5040314	5042434	There was a handful of others.
5042454	5045495	There was like a Barbie game and a Monster High game in 2015.
5045875	5047735	So, yeah.
5049336	5051556	Yeah, DarkSakura says, I think we covered the last Just Dance.
5051596	5052977	I'm sure we did, but you know.
5054717	5057618	Doesn't that all seem like a lifetime ago at this point?
5057638	5059498	I think it does.
5061334	5065780	Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week, Excite Truck.
5066561	5068543	Sorry, I'm rearranging screens here as I'm talking.
5068663	5073530	All right, let's move on and talk about some other headlines going on in the world.
5073770	5076413	So Loki, let's do some rapid fire news here.
5077267	5084311	Yeah, Sega is delisting 60 games across console and PC digital storefronts next month.
5084611	5086512	And these are all retro games.
5086992	5092495	So all of your Sega Genesis collection games, I think, are being delisted.
5093016	5096938	I'm wondering if they're just like releasing a new pack or something like that with these or something.
5097818	5121134	um but yeah it's a lot of these are being delisted i probably have them all in my steam library right now obviously you will be able to play them if you have them already in your libraries but you will not be able to purchase them again although at this point like just i don't know i'm sure you could buy a new collection when it comes out collections that are probably available used yeah
5122236	5144366	yeah so um and then this is really awesome uh so awesome games done quick is returning back again of course in January and one of the um highlights that they've mentioned so far is a crazy taxi speed run but they're gonna be backed by a live cover band of the offspring playing the music of the game
5145626	5172353	that just sounds amazing it's genius because they can't they don't want to get even though I think getting shut down for copyright would be really shitty when it's a charity event I also understand a lot of that matching is automated so there's probably some legit concerns about you know automated copyright matching shutting it down I think it's genius to use the cover band to do it and it's gonna be a lot of fun too especially when you consider you know they're back in person they have been for a bit it's a live event and it has to be a lot of fun to be at
5172970	5176533	Yeah, it's supposed to run from January 5th to January 12th.
5177735	5182659	And yeah, they've got a full list of the games so far.
5183120	5190106	I'm curious to see if there's any other really big ones that would be interesting.
5193249	5194571	Well, no, Excite Truck...
5197239	5205006	and we do not know if the hosting because our own Bobby Blackwolf here at VOG Network we don't know the status of that yet because the hosting I don't think has been selected yet.
5205466	5208669	Several for Nintendo World Championships NES edition.
5209330	5210090	It's interesting.
5210151	5214454	Oh yeah, because they did one of those during the Hurricane run that I was watching so that'll be interesting to watch.
5215015	5222621	They're going to do some PS1 Mystery Versus tournaments so there's going to be some of those.
5223943	5224103	Um...
5225999	5245415	there's going to be a person playing Elden Ring with a saxophone controller that's amazing that is awesome yeah I mean I don't know lots of really interesting games so I'm looking I can't wait to see what comes out of that it's always a good time alright
5246584	5249066	Well, moving on to news out of the Switch.
5271844	5276327	And as part of, you know, you can pre-order the digital version and the physical edition of Stray.
5277448	5287614	There is a PDF that Annapurna has put up online that you can print out your own cover for the game, replacing the cat's face with your own cat.
5288194	5291375	This is a little silly because it's just a PDF of the box art with that.
5291436	5301520	But still, I think it's a clever idea to get people to post their own cats in that and drive a little hype for the game before it releases on November 19th, 2024 for $40.
5302941	5308743	I think even though that's already been out on the PlayStation 5 for a bit, I think that'll be a Christmas gift for some kids.
5308984	5311425	I think that one's going to sell a little bit.
5311505	5313906	So that's one to keep an eye on for sure.
5315083	5320355	Well, since we know it's getting to be that time of year, I don't think we're getting to the big, big release date yet.
5320395	5325266	I think it'll be in two weeks, but we still have a lot this week as we travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5325326	5325646	Right, Loki?
5326772	5328812	Yeah, it's kind of quiet this week.
5328852	5335474	It's not really packed, but yeah, I mean, it kind of dies down by Black Friday, sort of.
5335514	5335994	Yes, that's true.
5336854	5343055	So we've got this week Backpack Hero on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5343735	5348656	Rocket Knight Adventures Resparked on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
5349257	5351097	V Rising on PlayStation 5.
5351877	5355738	Fruit Mountain on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
5357353	5374216	Magical Drop 6 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin are coming out on PlayStation 4 and then for the original on PC and Nintendo Switch
5375317	5391993	We have Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, Sunnyside on PC, and Batten Chaos 1 and 2 HD Remaster on PC.
5392754	5393094	That's it.
5393574	5393775	Nice.
5394827	5396828	I think I'm going to look at my dates here.
5396928	5397348	Yes, it is.
5397388	5397828	That is it.
5397948	5398168	All right.
5398188	5399949	We're going to go to Japan and check out the releases there.
5399989	5403410	Of course, the Dragon Quest III HD 2D remake, you know that's coming out in Japan.
5403970	5406311	And that will be out on the 14th on the Nintendo Switch.
5406471	5411353	Also on the Switch, we have B-Blade X Zone is also coming out this week.
5411713	5414113	We have Core Keeper on the Switch this week.
5414294	5417315	Lego Horizon Adventures getting a release in Japan this week on the Switch.
5418915	5421556	And we also have Q and Q2 Physical Edition coming
5421916	5443442	Sika Game Special Edition is being released for the Switch as well and I think that might be it you don't usually put stuff up against a Dragon Quest game even if it is a remake so it's surprising there's even a little bit there but on the PlayStation 5 we also have some things to talk about there for Japan including Farming Simulator 25 hell yeah that is out in Japan this week
5444342	5448604	and LEGO Horizon Adventures, of course, also out on PlayStation 5.
5449444	5452185	And then Core Keeper, also out on the PlayStation 5.

5469513	5470753	Finally out this week in Japan.
5470913	5473175	I thought for sure they already had Minecraft on PS5.
5473235	5474215	Maybe this is the first time.
5474255	5475616	I don't know.
5475636	5477077	It might be the first retail release.
5477417	5477757	They did.
5477917	5483861	And I just realized I'm going to have to re-read the releases because I was looking up the wrong month.
5485111	5486936	Didn't Jamie do that last week?
5486976	5487879	What's going on around here?
5488199	5488681	I don't know.
5489443	5491729	It must have scrolled up the page because I said it earlier.
5491969	5492651	Go ahead.
5494096	5494416	All right.

5660185	5660405	Nice.
5660865	5664108	Alright, we have a few more headlines for you and then we'll get to the listener roundtable.
5664128	5674476	I know we have at least one email tonight so we'll get to that and maybe actually we have some blue sky posts too so we'll get to all those in just a moment here but first, Loki with our next last headline.
5675299	5686148	Yes, so fans of Overwatch are suspecting that Blizzard's about to announce a classic Overwatch announcement.
5686208	5694295	They have a trailer that is premiering in 13 hours tomorrow at 9 a.m., November 11th.
5696277	5723930	at least Pacific Time and apparently in that the thumbnail right now is Tracer in her original classic Overwatch outfit and so the thought being you know that since they were testing 6v6 originally not that long ago and now this are they going to be announcing classic Overwatch like they did classic WoW to try to like
5725140	5734026	Have their cake and eat it too, I guess, as far as what people wanted in Overwatch and what they changed and what people didn't like and all that stuff.
5734466	5734926	Who knows?
5735527	5739990	Very interesting, especially that all of this seems to be happening after the Microsoft change.
5740350	5744393	I don't know if I'm reading into the tea leaves too much to that, but that could be interesting.
5744533	5744893	I don't know.
5745533	5745553	I...
5746734	5746795	Yep.
5764632	5785237	and last on our list of stories for tonight a Mass Effect TV show is in the works you might have missed it around all the other crap going on this week but N7 day happened November the 7th right and that's a big day for Mass Effect and you know BioWare had come out in advance and said don't expect anything major okay basically saying don't expect a new trailer all right
5785737	5786377	N7 Inspired Armor Dragon Age
5810649	5811669	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5827281	5831706	Casey has worked on screenplays for such hits as F9, The Fast Saga.
5832086	5838713	He also did rewrites for 10 Cloverfield Lane and a sci-fi film called Kin.
5839413	5842997	So that news, of course, all came out on N7 Day.
5843317	5846320	You know, and it's one of those I'll believe it when I see it type of things.
5846421	5849624	But let's remember, Amazon did a pretty decent job with Fallout.
5850184	5852306	So, and it was very well received.
5852406	5862153	So now, of course, you know, just like we saw happen with Netflix and when some of their things were successful, like The Witcher, we're seeing things that are more greenlit around the universe, so to speak.
5862533	5863714	So it'd be interesting to see what happens.
5865936	5870439	TigerClaw in chat asks, will the Mass Effect series feature a male or female Shepard?
5870799	5871920	God willing, neither.
5872540	5874061	That's my hope, is that, you know.
5874101	5875362	It should be an actual German Shepard.
5875523	5875683	Yeah.
5879501	5882005	You know what gamers are not fucking ready for?
5882305	5884208	You know what gamers are not fucking ready for?
5884268	5884809	And I mean it.
5885429	5885830	I mean it.
5886297	5887438	NonBinaryShepherd.
5887818	5896025	I want NonBinaryShepherd because I just want gamers to fucking implode going, this show's too woke before they've even fucking seen 60 seconds of it.
5896506	5901129	That is my wish for you gamers of America and specifically America.
5901470	5910097	And by the way, I say this as somebody using he, him, they pronouns and I really would love to see NonBinaryShepherd.
5910617	5911458	That aside...
5912085	5913807	I actually don't think it should have Shepard at all.
5915848	5921573	Mass Effect is a huge universe, pun, but there are so many other stories they could do.
5922014	5925497	They could do side stories talking about some of the other conflicts that happen in the universe.
5925877	5931302	You could have other cases of people coming across the Reapers, joining at the Citadel, things like that.
5932643	5936346	I would really like to see the Mass Effect TV series tell a different story in the universe.
5937007	5939669	But if they're not able to do it, then I would like to see them do FemShep.
5941172	5941893	That's interesting.
5952543	5952723	All right.
5953043	5958067	Yeah, Tiger Class says it could be about a new team and Shepard could be mentioned as this figure that exists out there.
5958188	5958468	Yes.
5959729	5961410	And I think there's a couple other things to consider.
5961470	5970878	Number one, Andromeda, whatever you feel about that game, was able to tell another story in the Mass Effect universe that really didn't involve Shepard.
5970898	5972179	I mean, yes, there were...
5972819	5993496	you know but for them for the by and large it was a story that didn't need to involve Shepard I'm not saying that if they want to retell Andromeda I don't care I don't think people are as emotionally attached to that game as they were the main trilogy but again I don't think they should retread that old ground I really don't um and um yeah maybe this is yeah and
5994631	5996311	Maybe they just don't mention Shepard at all.
5996952	5997412	I think that's it.
5997472	6004554	Or Shepard could be a figure that's out there that they hear about and that the gender is never confirmed one way or the other, and I don't think it needs to be.
6005014	6005414	And that's it.
6005434	6008895	I think Shepard is something people talk about, someone people talk about, and then that's it.
6010695	6018437	The other thing to consider, though, is that by the time this TV show actually comes out, we'll be talking about a new game.
6019338	6020058	So what if...
6021124	6049046	maybe the TV show is going to be a bridge between the first trilogy and the new game I almost said second trilogy maybe I'm being a little bit you know but you know whatever is next for Mass Effect what if the TV show serves as a bridge between that because we've seen that sort of thing before with movies right don't we have like Star Wars shows that are set between movie timelines right in that thing I don't know yeah yeah and or so it'll be interesting we'll see
6050305	6050867	I'll watch it.
6050907	6051530	Of course I will.
6051951	6052573	I'll give it a shot.
6053459	6055140	My expectations aren't high, but I'll give it a shot.
6055440	6057260	All right, let's get into the listener roundtable tonight.
6057320	6060041	We invite your participation every week here on the show.
6060841	6064902	If you want to give us a call, we'll open up Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6064982	6067763	But actually, we have some emails tonight, which is pretty cool.
6068504	6071845	Oh, yeah, Dark Tetsuya mentions the Quantum Leap reboot was the thing that happened.
6071865	6077826	They're talking about a famous non-binary actor in Sandman.
6078106	6081427	Mishkin brought up that there was a character in Sandman who was non-binary.
6081507	6081888	And yeah.
6083328	6084569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6102119	6104020	Let's get to the emails.
6104600	6107822	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
6108082	6109663	We have two emails tonight, believe it or not.
6109964	6114326	The first email tonight comes from Fabrice from Belgium, who we haven't heard from in a while.
6114666	6115727	Great to hear from you, Fabrice.
6115747	6116307	Let's get into it.
6116767	6117748	Hello, OLR.
6117848	6120810	It's been a while since I mailed you, but now I finally come around to it.
6121390	6127534	I recently bought a mini PC with 11,000 games on it for over 60 consoles and platforms.
6128214	6129254	Thank you for watching!
6152282	6157344	Secondly, my wife and I are super into playing pinball because a real pinball table is way too expensive to buy.
6157464	6158624	We have other priorities at the moment.
6158904	6160725	I've been thinking about buying a digital pinball table.
6161245	6165466	No one doesn't come close to the real thing, but I think it's a good way to get to know the rules and so forth of a pinball table.
6166067	6169308	Another plus is that you can have a lot of games and only one table.
6169768	6171488	Our favorite at the moment is Iron Maiden.
6171989	6172889	What are your thoughts about this?
6173469	6175710	I'd like to thank you guys again for doing the podcast every week.
6176090	6179071	Thinking about the things I've done while listening to you guys, it's quite a list.
6179571	6180432	Well, thank you, Fabrice.
6180512	6181433	Appreciate the email.
6181653	6184696	And hey, do you have a couch that I could sleep on for the next four years?
6185797	6186297	Just wondering.
6187178	6187798	Over there in Belgium?
6188879	6190321	Seems like a place that has its shit together.
6191061	6191322	All right.
6191362	6193063	In all seriousness, I'm not leaving.
6193083	6193704	I'm not going anywhere.
6195285	6196566	Let's address the two parts of this.
6196606	6199009	The first part is about the retro gaming system.
6199449	6200890	And I think you bring up a good point.
6201030	6203393	A lot of people love to have a giant...
6204292	6205312	Thank you for watching!
6225599	6228462	and I think that's a lot of fun to be able to revisit those things.
6228842	6237349	And I think, yeah, for most people it is that retro itch, but if you really spend some time going in depth, you might find some real good gems from back in the day.
6238050	6239992	So definitely look up The Guardian Legend.
6240712	6241412	on the NES.
6241833	6242673	Spend some time with that.
6243633	6249916	A game that came up recently I was talking about at the party I talked about earlier in the show, Dragon 2 Dragon's View.
6250276	6251937	That's a game I really want to go back and play again.
6251977	6253237	That was an underrated game too.
6253417	6254418	Actraiser.
6254718	6260200	I'm sure all of us can name these retro classics we love, but try to really play them for a little while.
6260260	6261861	There's some really amazing...
6262441	6291263	great games that really show you like again and sometimes you might play a retro game like I mentioned earlier in the show Donkey Kong on the Atari 2600 you play it now and it's like wow this really kind of looks like barf compared to the arcade game but then you kind of go well but considering the size and the hardware they had to work with they really did a decent job trying to get that feeling making you feel like and that same kind of dopamine hit of playing the arcade game without necessarily being pixel for pixel perfect
6291883	6292604	I mean, yeah, I get the idea, like
6310051	6312553	Having a large collection of ROMs and stuff like that.
6313333	6317697	Yeah, it's fun to just throw them all onto a PC and then never play them.
6318217	6319978	Like I do my Steam collection.
6320199	6320939	Right, that's right.
6321159	6321700	Yeah, that's right.
6321980	6325222	You may have a backlog of retro games, but your Steam backlog is more embarrassing.
6326663	6327964	That's my advice to Fabrice.
6328144	6333627	Fabrice, I guarantee your Steam backlog is more embarrassing than your retro backlog.
6333707	6339509	I keep trying to catch up on Humble, man, because I'm in the Humble monthly thing.
6340010	6341230	I have so many games.
6342251	6347093	I get capped out of being able to put codes into Steam all the time.
6347333	6349454	Just so many.
6349534	6350795	I'm never going to play these games.
6351946	6358989	Now, as far as the digital pinball table, they're pretty pricey, and I don't own one, but Bobby Blackwolf does.
6359069	6360649	He might be a good guy to ask about this.
6361309	6363990	I have played the one that is at his house, and I had fun with it.
6364070	6371013	I mean, just imagine that the TV is on its side and there, and the pinball games are on it, and it's fun.
6371133	6379496	But another decent way to play those games is that the digital pinball recreations they have right now, like Pinball FX and those games,
6380156	6381857	It's a really good way to get a taste for a table.
6382197	6387819	Now, granted, you don't have that sense of, oh, it's lying down in front of you and you have the buttons and all that stuff.
6389380	6399884	One thing to keep in mind, though, is that when you do have a giant setup like that, you're going to be more anxious to tilt the machine, which was an important mechanic of older pinball.
6399944	6409188	Now, granted, a lot of people don't like to tilt their real machines that are thousands and thousands of dollars as well, but those things are built to take a little bit of a punch because tilting is part of pinball.
6410128	6413590	So that's something else to consider is do you have a tendency to actually use tilt mechanics?
6413930	6417511	That could be something that – I think they can map those to buttons though.
6417591	6421273	Again, I don't own a – but it would seem very logical they could map that to buttons.
6421673	6426075	But it's never going to be the same as the actual physical oomph of a tilt.
6426795	6454295	but you're right can it give you an overview of a digital table yes can you put a lot of digital tables in it yes you know there's a lot with that I think uh one of the it's Pinball FX or Zen one of the I think it's Zen I think it's the other one will actually sell you digital pinball table licenses to use their tables on the thing um but again I I would kind of refer you to Bobby Blackwolf here at VOG for further questions on that because he's done more research on that because he owns one but I had a lot of fun when I played it for what it's worth
6455596	6456458	But thanks for the email.
6456478	6457300	I really appreciate it.
6457440	6460205	And I don't remember you talking about a wife last time you emailed us.
6460245	6464553	So congratulations if you got married in the last couple of years, because I might have missed it, which is fair.
6464894	6465936	But congratulations.
6465996	6467519	And I'm glad to hear you're doing well.
6469090	6469470	Let's see.
6469550	6473652	Let's go to the next email, except I accidentally closed the mailbag because I'm a genius.
6473832	6474933	So it's going to take me a minute here.
6475273	6478794	Hey, Loki, do we have any last minute stories here while I open up the mailbag?
6478854	6479415	Okay, great.
6479575	6480915	Yeah, let's hear it.
6480935	6487998	We have a last minute announcement from Nintendo that there's a Nintendo Direct coming tomorrow.
6488739	6490559	However, we do know what it's going to be about.
6490719	6491800	It is going to be about
6492352	6499416	Super Nintendo World, and the upcoming Donkey Kong Country Edition to the Super Nintendo World.
6499696	6501778	Ten minutes long, gonna showcase that.
6502698	6503819	So... In Japan?
6504741	6505742	Yeah, in Japan.
6505762	6508764	Oh, I think they're doing it in Orlando too.
6508784	6510365	Sadly, Hollywood I don't think is getting it.
6510666	6521534	No game information will be featured, but hey, I'm all down for hopefully some more interesting rides because the Mario Kart ride looked okay, but in the Yoshi ride looked pretty lame.
6521874	6524036	Have you seen the things, that Donkey Kong coaster?
6524176	6533423	It looks fucking incredible because they do that trick with the rails where it's actually attached to the rail underneath, but then the rail that's an illusion disappears.
6533443	6533623	That's
6533683	6534064	That's right.
6534084	6534867	I forgot about that.
6534887	6536532	That's going to be so cool.
6537094	6537496	Can't wait.
6538338	6538559	Anyway.
6538579	6538960	I can't wait.
6539181	6539402	All right.
6539763	6540666	Let's get to our next email.
6541741	6544883	It is from YYR, and it's always a pleasure to hear from YYR.
6545283	6546424	Hello, LR!
6546484	6547745	That's how you know it's a YYR email.
6548505	6550486	I just wanted to let you know that it's that time again.
6550967	6555729	I'm going to be attempting the DDR Max 300 Birthday Challenge again for the fifth year in a row.
6556270	6562333	This year, I'll need to clear it 45 times with at least 23 of those being on Expert Difficulty.
6562753	6564114	Is it 23 because it's half?
6564454	6564895	It must be.
6564975	6566336	It must be half Expert Difficulty.
6566976	6568137	Round it up because it's an odd number.
6568777	6572580	And once again, I'm going to do this as a charity stream to benefit Feeding America.
6573200	6587010	Best of all, for the first time, if you're one of the top 10 donors to chip in $45 or more, you can make me attempt any other single chart in DDR Grand Prix to be played after I've completed the challenge.
6587430	6590092	You're going to be so tired, Aaron.
6590152	6593654	I'm going to be doing this live on my Twitch channel at 1 p.m.
6593774	6596035	Eastern on Saturday, November 16th.
6596615	6602319	YYR's Twitch channel is YYR57695.
6602399	6615827	You know, I put the link in chat, but I could probably do you one better and actually give you a proper shout-out in chat right there so you can get people to just click that button and follow if they want to see that on Saturday, again, at 1 p.m.
6615947	6616227	Eastern.
6617788	6621171	So if you're able, please drop by, drop a few bucks for this great organization.
6621532	6625615	Watch me suffer a bit and lengthen my suffering to the beats of your choice.
6626196	6628057	We love suffering in this country, don't we?
6629098	6632902	In other news, San Francisco now has its own Round 1 Arcade.
6633422	6635784	It just opened yesterday in the Stonestown Galleria.
6636145	6638307	There are two DDR cabinets and a whole lot more.
6638447	6639147	Go there and play.
6639648	6640669	I did hear about this.
6640909	6643211	Our buddy JD, who...
6644372	6645793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6671212	6672934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6690149	6693634	So anyway, continue with YYR's email.
6694215	6704529	In other news, I would like to gladly announce that I'll be showing the finally completed Super Duper Multitasking at the upcoming Super MagFest 2025 this January.
6704929	6706091	So please look forward to that.
6706491	6707413	More details to come.
6708652	6709392	About time.
6709532	6711733	I'm really glad to hear it, YYR, in all seriousness.
6711753	6716395	I know you're very busy, especially being a parent now and all that stuff, but that is incredible news.
6717035	6723077	Now I really wish I was going to MAGFest, to be honest, but so many conventions, so little time.
6723217	6724898	Although I can confirm...
6726379	6730623	I have everything in the works to go to Southern Fried Game Expo next year.
6731304	6732945	I skipped this last year.
6732985	6734086	I went in 2023.
6734587	6736429	I am planning to go to in 2025.
6736629	6737970	So I will be in Atlanta twice.
6738911	6743455	So for what it's worth, I'm missing MAGFest, but I will be at Southern Fried this year in Atlanta in 2025.
6744056	6744536	So that'll be fun.
6746009	6748431	YYR concludes, thanks as always for the show.
6748851	6753434	A lot of shit sucks lately, so any opportunity we have to come together is appreciated.
6753754	6756256	Please be well, stay safe, and have a good week.
6756756	6758758	Love and hugs, Aaron or YYR.
6758958	6760799	I appreciate the sentiments there, Aaron.
6761019	6762920	And yes, you take care of yourself as well.
6763240	6764301	And good luck with your stream.
6764321	6765522	That sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.
6767096	6768697	All right, that's it for emails.
6768937	6773420	Again, I'll give one more shout out for our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6773820	6777622	And then if you have any chat comments, things you want to ask us about, you can put that in there as well.
6778443	6782285	DJ Ranma S in chat says, we're getting a round one in New York City finally.
6782905	6783506	Wow, that's...
6784414	6786195	Wow, where are they going to put it?
6786275	6788095	I bet it's another converted mall situation.
6788215	6789396	I bet it was like a big store.
6790036	6794257	I know NYC is built a little differently than, you know, but it'll probably look similar to San Francisco.
6794337	6796278	Maybe like a little bit more on the outskirts somewhere.
6797658	6798638	You have to tell me where, Ranma.
6798678	6799198	I'd be curious.
6800679	6802099	Because I doubt it's in Manhattan.
6802399	6803620	It's got to be out one of the other burbs.
6805020	6808601	PodCulture says it's up in Queens, said Ranma.
6808661	6809502	It's converted mall.
6809562	6810382	Yep, that's what I figured.
6811684	6814345	HotCulture says, ours was at a Macy's.
6814785	6819426	SGO100Matt says, I only heard of one in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
6819506	6822086	So yeah, Flushing, Queens, and Chinatown.
6822186	6822647	Interesting.
6823427	6823807	Pretty cool.
6825967	6827928	Round ones, they're showing up more and more often.
6828088	6828848	And it's so funny.
6828928	6831188	I said for so long, God, I wish they'd open one up near me.
6831489	6832849	And then one opens up in Roseville.
6832929	6834129	I've maybe been there three times.
6835549	6836970	Roseville's so far.
6836990	6837070	Yeah.
6838984	6840772	It's on the other side of town completely for me.
6844954	6845294	Oh, well.
6845474	6846254	I'm just complaining.
6846294	6846935	I like to complain.
6847295	6848656	I wish they'd put one downtown.
6849296	6854679	You know, maybe there's no K Street Mall anymore, but that's where I wish they'd put one is in that area.
6856100	6860303	Instead, we have Punchbowl Social, which is not really the same thing.
6860483	6861283	It's more of a bar.
6861683	6861944	It's cute.
6861964	6863044	I'm not dogging on it.
6863084	6870909	It's cute for what it is, especially considering that the old mall downtown is where the light the beam shit that you hear whenever the Sacramento Kings win a game.
6871509	6872270	That was the mall.
6873246	6894987	once upon a time so they bulldozed everything except the Macy's because Macy's owned Macy's everything around it and they created that arena and now you know it from Light the Beam and all that stuff when the kings win the games that used to be the mall that's where the round one should have been and so they have a little punch bowl social but that's more of a bar that happens to have games in it which is appropriate for being right there by the arena
6895367	6895827	Sounds awesome.
6923649	6924349	I think it's a chain.
6924909	6926310	I've seen them in Vegas before too.
6926370	6928211	It's just one of those big candy stores.
6928411	6929531	So anyway.
6930852	6931292	All right.
6931392	6933373	Well, I guess we're going to wrap things up for the night.
6933453	6934973	But thank you as always for joining us.
6935013	6939695	Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry, it will help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
6939995	6941636	But we need more voices to put out on air.
6941696	6943216	So tell a friend or two about the show.
6943516	6944257	Help us spread the word.
6944297	6946978	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or –
6948058	6948779	and DarkSakura.com
6975456	6981762	By the way, we asked this week, and I think this is really funny, because I wrote it, so of course I'm funny.
6982363	6988809	We said, what's your favorite video game where you get to play a hero who leads a rebellion against a corrupt government, asking for a friend?
6989489	6993173	I had no reason whatsoever for writing that, but we got some good answers.
6994434	6997757	Mike Deft said, many Final Fantasy games come to mind right now.
6997857	6999299	Yeah, I think of Final Fantasy games.
7000307	7007131	DarkDetsuya said Final Fantasy VI, though it probably took its fair share of inspiration from Star Wars, A New Hope, but a good story is a good story.
7007291	7007511	Yes.
7008152	7014556	NinjaBuddyDev says OgreBattle64, you rebel agents, you rebel agents to church.
7015096	7018658	Some people think the church and the government are the same if you catch my drift.
7018818	7019659	I do catch your drift.
7020493	7030278	Obni, I hope I said that right, A-U-B-N-I, Obni on Blue Sky said, witnessing the destruction of the world as you know it by a ridiculous clown man with no regards for human life.
7030699	7033880	Final Fantasy VI, good call, good call.
7033980	7040164	Download, spelled L-O-D-E, says, you mean aside from the guy in the picture I posted, did anybody guess the picture?
7040204	7042345	It was Suikoden, it was the picture, Suikoden.
7043025	7044867	Uh, NotPictured, Gremio.
7045227	7048870	So I get, maybe I'm thinking that user thought we meant specifically Suikoden, but that's all right.
7049010	7050371	I'll take, I'll always take a Suikoden answer.
7051252	7057137	Uh, AKOD, who has the username FireAgua, FireAgua, walk with me.
7058738	7060600	I love a good Twin Peaks reference.
7061040	7061640	Props to that.
7062161	7066765	Uh, Unicorn Overlord technically counts as long as you don't get the bad ending.
7067465	7068066	Oh, very true.
7068086	7068526	Very true.
7069126	7069487	And, um,
7070985	7076369	Matt Ostro in chat says, while it's more so about a corrupt corporation, what's the difference anymore?
7076669	7078030	The game was just a lot of fun.
7078151	7079892	Red Faction for the PlayStation 2.
7080873	7085096	And Dartusia says, don't forget to do alt text next time you do images in our chat.
7085156	7085957	Oh, I did forget.
7085997	7086557	I'm sorry about that.
7086577	7087578	I'm usually pretty good about that.
7088258	7109637	but I do all that from my desktop not my phone so it's set a little differently thank you for the reminder because I do try to use alt text to at least convey like if there's words on the screen or the bare minimum of what's happening yeah so thank you for the call out I will fix that next time I want to see if we got any other there was an interesting bleep that we got from because I thought this was cool
7111218	7112399	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7135700	7139424	And then it says in the follow-up, now Bobby Blackwolf liked the post.
7139764	7142968	Jeez, that's a throwback from when I used to listen to All Games Interactive.
7143308	7144249	Blast from the past.
7144369	7146432	I'm going to check out all of y'all's stuff.
7146472	7150376	Well, shout out to you, Ante, if you are out there listening tonight.
7150977	7153119	Welcome back from all of us here at OLR.
7153619	7157704	I always love that, that people are like, wait, you guys are still around?
7159568	7164631	Do you think there's anyone who got the Guinness book that was like, hold up, that show's still on?
7168633	7168993	Maybe.
7169173	7170053	I love it, I love it.
7170113	7171094	I don't know, probably not.
7171554	7171874	All right.
7172274	7173395	Who buys the Guinness book anymore?
7173615	7176597	I was already in the spiel to wrap up tonight, so I already said the news.
7176617	7179618	Sorry about, I will try to remember to work blue sky to my rotation.
7180038	7182460	I have to write a note in my show role or I'll forget.
7183140	7184601	But that brings us to final thoughts.
7184641	7185681	We really are about wrapped up.
7185761	7186942	So Loki, your final thought tonight.
7188193	7204509	hopefully I get a lot done this week not work related hopefully a lot Minecraft work my final thought is a lot of people on the red side of the house have been saying what happened this last week is a mandate
7205638	7207239	I also say that it's a mandate.
7208019	7214001	I say this is a mandate for me to be an even louder and more obnoxious homosexual over the next four years.
7214221	7218222	I am not going anywhere no matter how hard you try.
7219162	7219922	Thank you very much.
7220663	7221563	Have a good week everybody.
