9750	19578	Some may have considered it inevitable that the PlayStation Portal would eventually decouple from only supporting one's own PlayStation 5, but given the existence of PlayStation Now streaming to Aveda and PlayStation TV, I wonder why it wasn't there to begin with.
19958	24502	It probably boils down to the truth of manufacturing, computing, really anything involving a consumer market.
24742	26644	Scaling is always the hardest task to do.
27264	28886	This is the Economic Realities Headline.
28986	34150	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this portable gaming update and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34530	36492	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39252	41694	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41754	46377	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46537	56603	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live and back once again with episode number 1026 of our show for tonight, November the 24th of 2024.
58204	61687	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts.
61887	64889	First off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
66250	66370	Hi.
66810	67170	Hello.
67270	67891	How are you doing, Jamie?
68888	69569	I'm a lot better.
69669	73814	My voice is still healing, but yeah, doing better.
73834	76096	Yeah, I was going to say, you sound a lot better, even if maybe not 100%.
76136	76417	You're like 99.8%.
76457	77258	I'd actually put it more like 85%.
77418	77578	Fine.
83257	84378	I've been drinking cold things.
84798	85018	Yeah.
85878	87259	We just got, I'm drinking hot things.
87359	91241	We just got a new coffee maker today because our- Another Keurig?
92162	99085	No, it's a different, I guess other brands can make Keurigs now because I think it's a Ninja, like our, the thing that makes the ice cream.
99205	99425	Yeah.
99465	101787	So we have an, well, it's Costco, whatever it is.
102107	104048	So my husband is a giant Costco queen.
104808	106229	and always looking at the deals.
106509	109230	So I guess there was some type of ninja coffee maker that was available cheaper there.
109590	118535	And I've been hinting that our existing coffee maker is kind of old and isn't looking any the wiser for being an old device.
118835	120075	So we should probably just replace it.
120355	124517	So we bought a fancy new one for like $100 that's usually like $150 or something like that.
125258	125958	That's not bad.
126018	132081	When we replaced my old Keurig, we got the same quote model, but it had like
133485	135258	Internet and QR codes and shit.
135359	135520	Mm-hmm.
136658	137979	I'm like, do I need this?
138800	139040	Probably not.
139060	139520	I guess so.
139881	140281	Probably not.
140321	141842	DLC for your coffee maker.
143143	149809	I will say this one, though, also does like the little, like the actual pots of coffee, a carafe, I guess.
150209	159336	It actually, well, that's more like a, but you know, it actually does like the fuller coffee brewing that will, so you can actually switch back and forth between K-cups and grounds, like really easy.
159697	163240	So I think that's kind of cool because that might help us in like using less K-cups overall.
163740	164581	I just buy them all biodegradable.
164601	165702	I have the refillable cups.
165722	165802	Yeah.
181235	185640	I actually always scrape out the crowns and save them for my compost anyway.
185800	186881	It's just a thing I do.
187021	187362	That works.
187782	189985	And also, it keeps compost from smelling as bad.
190005	191907	I was going to say, it makes all your flowers smell like coffee.
192407	194490	The best part of waking up.
194530	196312	SSJ100Matt says, Coffee DRM.
196432	197814	I think we have come full circle from that.
197834	201598	I remember Coffee DRM was a big thing with Keurig 2.0 and we talked about
201778	203959	I don't know if he's had coffee or not, but let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
203979	204440	I haven't.
204620	208122	Yeah, I was going to say you're not a coffee drinker at all from what I remember.
226208	229451	I get a white mocha, but not usually.
230913	231693	Just a sweet treat?
231954	234296	No, it's coffee.
234816	235617	I take that as coffee.
236238	237018	A white mocha?
237098	238640	I don't know if that's really coffee.
239841	241122	It's a suggestion of coffee.
241142	242423	It's got coffee in it.
243464	245286	And also, white chocolate is not chocolate.
247939	250963	This is us dashing your dreams.
251023	251763	I know, I know.
252004	252985	I don't care.
253005	254426	I have no standards for coffee.
254466	255988	He's like, I'll drink another.
257029	257970	See if I give a shit.
259872	260873	Drink too much and you will.
263016	264157	How are you doing otherwise, Loki?
265447	266407	I'm doing okay.
266767	268468	I've been very busy this week.
268488	268848	That's right.
268928	273849	This was your big week off to work on your content.
274150	277050	I'm sure you're doing other things too, but I know you're working on your content.
278271	281652	Well, I saw you put out at least one new video, like came across my eye.
281672	282772	I was watching for a little bit.
282812	287073	It was like you were building a new, I think a new carnival attraction in a space.
287133	288534	You were like, here's this big blank space.
288574	289254	I'm going to put a thing here.
289454	290434	I added plushies.
291014	291454	That's right.
291614	294675	So collectible plushies that you can get prize tickets.
295515	298036	I made Redemption games.
298196	305837	All the rides are Redemption stuff now and you trade in tickets for plushies and it all works with Redstone and custom models and all that stuff.
305897	309158	So that's the way I spent this week on instead of working on the water ride.
309358	311598	I have started working on the water ride this week though.
313179	315299	But yeah, I'm still worried that it's going to
317120	317581	I don't know.
317821	320702	I was complaining to people earlier, as I do.
322282	326364	I put in three weeks worth of work into something, and it gets no views.
326564	330685	And my channel now, the last 28 days, I've lost eight subscribers.
331566	337748	And my watch time has gone from... I used to average about 100 views a day, and it's now 16.
337788	338208	It's like...
341741	344906	Why put the effort in if no one's going to see it?
345067	345708	You know what I mean?
345968	347170	It's just, it's annoying.
347932	348792	It's a landscape.
348832	356296	I guess if you don't just do what everybody else is doing, then this is what you get, I guess.
356696	364700	And I can see where that gets really frustrating and stuff, but I really hope you don't let that slow you down.
364760	368061	YouTube is a tough cookie to crack.
368702	371343	I've been trying to do a little more on YouTube.
371463	372964	I would say I'm not taking the effort
373484	374685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
388701	408718	I had tech difficulty fuck up an entire video and it's hard to bounce back from that so trying to bounce back but you know I put out a good 18 or 19 classic gaming videos and those are really hard to get traction and the ones that are I think the most viewed out of all of those is my Super Mario Brothers 3 which was actually a Twitch stream
409178	412259	that I archived on YouTube and is getting a lot more views.
412319	415120	And I don't know why, because it wasn't a very good playthrough.
415240	417500	I kept dying all of the time on level eight.
417840	419281	Maybe people enjoy seeing that.
419361	419821	I don't know.
420261	423242	Or because it is such a popular game where people are searching for it.
423282	426623	But I would have thought maybe the niche stuff would get a little more traction.
426663	432285	But then a random ass Diablo 4 video I made probably got 10 times the views any of my classic gaming stuff did.
433085	436726	But it's okay because, again, I'm trying not to do it for...
437546	463290	that like I'm trying to do it for the whole like it's kind of fun to build an archive of playing classic games and having that library and playing the retro achievements into it and all of that um no I and I get that it's just more of like I look at like next season where I'm attempting to do something because last season was very stressful because there was and this is kind of a pattern that I keep going through where I have a general idea of what I'm doing but it's not
463710	464291	and DarkSakura.
483223	506818	like I don't know it's at the level of like where there's large creators that do something similar and that's like the content from like their entire server for months and it's getting so much attention to it and it's like I'm gonna do something very similar and it's gonna get no one watching it like I literally have just the people that I play with watching my content which is
508011	532636	it's weird because I have like 3,000 followers or 3,000 subscribers I have a few hundred on social media and like I get almost nothing and it's it's not even necessarily that it's bad like the content's bad it's YouTube itself doesn't push it and you can see there's a marked difference when the algorithm decides oh hey I'm gonna wake up today and actually do my job like it
533363	543747	It... Like, the last episode I put out, before this one, it was dead for a while, and then all of a sudden the algorithm pushed it for, like, 24 hours, and then it's dead again.
543847	547428	Like, it's just... They just don't do their job on their end, I guess.
547788	548349	Or whatever.
548449	548869	I don't know.
549149	555591	I know it's competing against a lot of stuff, but there's also a lot of stuff out there that's not as good that gets a lot more views.
555971	556792	I just don't know what the...
557492	580147	do with it other than like do what everybody else is doing oh it's big tutorials cool then that's all they'll come to your channel for or you'll just do a mod showcase video and that's all they'll come to your channel for they won't actually watch your other content have you thought about trying to do more like i know it's not good for the watch minutes but like just to try to like get people's attention and people can be very fickle have you thought about trying to do more of the i don't want to say like youtube shorts
580507	581327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
598756	603117	Go back to some of your old content and do like, okay, here is the time lapse of the Mega Man build.
603397	614039	Because yes, there's not a lot of people relative to the scale of things have seen your build, which means there's still a huge untapped audience and Mega Man 2 shit is timeless.
614379	621881	So I would say go back and try to just extract some of the time lapse and those quick hits and try to put those out there on things like YouTube Shorts and TikToks.
621941	623681	I know it's a bitch with editing, but like...
624321	624902	and DarkSakura.com.
644204	646166	I don't think it's that funny, but okay.
646426	650589	I guess it worked for TikTok nature and all that stuff.
651169	652290	It is what it is.
652770	658994	But now it's put this weird pressure on me where I'm like, well, whatever I post on TikTok next better be funny.
660755	661856	It's like, shit.
662682	663503	No, and I get that.
664503	666345	Yes, I could be better about doing that.
666445	669267	I did some of that for my first SMP.
669327	670788	I kind of went back and did some of those.
671348	678293	I haven't really had time to do a lot of the editing to get the rest of them, mainly because it was hard to condense it down to one minute.
679594	685218	But now that that cap has gone up a little bit, that should be a little bit easier.
685679	689201	And my newer time lapses are much shorter, too, because I've kind of tried to...
690443	694534	um change the way I make content to make it more engaging so that
695592	698053	People stay around longer, but I don't know.
698093	699074	I don't want to change it too much.
699134	702295	I don't want to defeat you because I think your videos are very good.
702315	703516	You explain things very well.
703896	705437	You do a good story arc.
705557	708598	I'm just leaning into, unfortunately, people don't have the attention span.
708618	709458	They want the quick hit.
709758	711779	They want that shot of, ooh, neat, you know, thing.
712080	723545	So it's like, well, you know, if your old content has kind of run its course, I say recycle it into quick hits and things that are going to grab people's attention and just see what's the worst that can happen.
724397	726218	That's true, yeah, for sure.
726938	729980	Anyway, a lovely content creation discussion here.
730720	737723	It's a holiday week in America, and we've got some news, but we're always happy to talk about that kind of stuff.
738264	744807	I will say Bobby Blackwolf says, short video that's too long, didn't read, and then have a card with a longer video at the end, maybe.
745887	748609	Yeah, you can link to the full stuff.
749369	777126	That's my game plan with the classic stuff too is not so and I'm waiting for I'm the same thing you are is that technically three minute stuff is supposed to be in YouTube shorts but they're not uploading directly in there yet so I don't trust the algorithm to be pushing them until but supposedly that's supposed to be done at the end of the month we'll see but I plan to go back through every single classic game video I've uploaded and make a short out of it and trickle those out too I'll tell you one thing I'm stopping doing is letting Twitch upload my shorts for me
778453	804675	I can do a much better editing job myself oh using the automated thing or whatever yeah it's just so limited and you know one of the things I could do in Final Cut is just like choose where my camera pans I guess of the screen instead of just fixing it at one point so yeah didn't you have a dead by daylight TikTok that got like thousands of views I swear I saw one of your TikToks came up on my feed and I was like dang she got she got a lot of hits on this what
805263	834158	a couple maybe hold on let me I mean I don't have like a whole ton of followers on TikTok wasn't there I don't remember if you guys showed me or if it was Arrington that showed me but there's a way in OBS you can set up where it records vertical and yes vertical yes it can be done but I couldn't tell you how to do it but it is I would still prefer to do my own editing well right it's so that you can record your gameplay
835456	857436	already in the format and then you just edit that down it makes it a little bit easier than having to like reformat everything yeah and that just depends on how you're cranking out the content like what what factory is going to work for you yeah i i do believe it's possible Loki i just couldn't tell you how to do it yeah anyway yeah i have like one of my big ones on here is um
860355	865779	All the ones where I sneak away from the killers and they don't see me or do dishes with them or meme around.
866099	866560	Interesting.
867220	875046	I do think, Loki, I don't know how much you're leveraging TikTok, but TikTok will give you 200 views on every video.
875426	876047	No, it won't.
876467	877068	I've tried.
877168	877528	Really?
877708	880290	I've re-uploaded some of my shorts there.
880590	880770	Nope.
881551	881871	Nothing.
882171	882912	Hardly anything.
882992	883773	Interesting.
883793	884593	I'm telling you.
884873	885214	It's just...
886553	911865	yeah because I did that and they even like they have even like long format stuff that's on there sometimes so I was like okay sure I'll try a long format one I'll try a short no it's just it's awful I no thanks interesting well then it's really gonna be interesting to see what happens with TikTok and this whole you know they're threatening to remove it from stores and all that stuff and I don't it's never gonna happen
912665	941660	I don't know like apparently I shudder as I say this because I don't like talking about politics right now but apparently the CEO of TikTok is attempting to go kiss the ring because he was talking to Lex Luthor over at X about who of course is you know the first bitch now as you know how to assumably how to get around the TikTok ban and to try to convince Chitalini that it would be in his good favor to unban the TikTok thing.
942799	952204	and I don't know how that's all going to play out but because I would think if you're TikTok and you're about to get banned you're going to create a web app but how effective is that going to be?
952425	952845	I don't know.
953505	953885	I don't know.
954165	961490	There's been talk about also TikTok might spin off into two different companies or something so I guess a lot can happen between now and January but I do feel like TikTok
962170	986945	you know maybe it's just recency bias my own luck on there but I feel like TikTok kind of at least nudges it a little bit I did notice the video that went viral didn't it started with a normal pattern as all my videos do but it was getting more likes in that time frame and I think because of that TikTok pushed it more that's what happened so you got to encourage your friends to hit that content early and push the like button for what it's worth
988089	990153	Oh, Bobby says reposts are better than likes.
990333	992758	Actually, that doesn't surprise me either.
992798	995302	I don't think my content ever got reposted until that one.
995863	997907	So, anyway, weird.
999176	999616	All right.
999716	1002157	Anyway, enough talk about content creation.
1002238	1003478	Let's get into video game news.
1003498	1004319	That's what we're here to talk about.
1004339	1004999	Create the content.
1005259	1005579	That's right.
1005599	1006540	Let's create the content.
1007500	1015704	Let's talk about an award ceremony that has a content creator of the year award announced the nominee list this week.
1015844	1018905	And there's some controversy along with that, as there usually is.
1018985	1020686	But this one is very interesting.
1020746	1021987	Loki, you want to start us off tonight?
1022932	1025014	Yeah, so Game Awards are right around the corner, I think.
1025094	1026535	Was it like two weeks?
1027215	1032019	It's on the 12th, a little bit later this year, I guess.
1032279	1033940	Oh, yeah, it's usually a little later than it is.
1034041	1037183	Yeah, it's around like the 8th or the 7th normally, I guess.
1037243	1038044	It just didn't work out.
1038684	1043628	Anyways, so they announced, of course, the different categories and the nominees.
1044389	1048292	So, you know, starting things off, obviously, the big one, Game of the Year.
1049093	1060142	Some of the, I mean, nothing really surprising, I think, but we've got Astro Bot, Boletro, Black Myth Wukong, Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erd Tree.
1060282	1065627	Kind of interesting to see that DLC is Game of the Year.
1065667	1066788	That's kind of like...
1067839	1068119	What?
1069100	1074262	Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor Re-Fantasio.
1075622	1077443	Yeah, Elden Ring should not be in there.
1077663	1079063	I'm sorry.
1079303	1080484	Let's talk about that a little bit.
1080944	1084345	How are we feeling about DLC as game of the year?
1086006	1086086	No.
1086286	1092308	I'm going to present the other side of it is many people would argue that that DLC was so...
1093969	1102997	Such a heavy volume, such a large brush of DLC that it's almost like its own standalone game.
1103357	1104618	Give its own category then.
1105038	1105759	I'm sorry, no.
1106079	1107200	It's not game of the year.
1107681	1109302	Elden Ring did not come out this year.
1109682	1109902	No.
1110403	1110543	Yeah.
1111235	1113436	I agree it should not be Game of the Year nominated.
1113756	1115217	And it has nothing to do with the quality of it.
1115257	1116618	I'm sure it's a great DLC.
1116978	1117959	Here is my reasoning.
1118439	1119419	I want to explain why.
1119559	1122861	Because I feel like I have a decent reason why it shouldn't be nominated.
1123882	1131465	When your game goes to win Game of the Year, that is a huge notch under your belt.
1131506	1135027	That's a huge uplift on your resume.
1135107	1137148	A huge thing to be able to say that you're working on.
1137509	1139810	And essentially, if this DLC wins that award...
1140370	1143613	Elden Ring as a game has won that award twice.
1144194	1148197	And to me, it's very similar to like, let's say Titanic.
1148518	1151421	The movie Titanic gets nominated for all of these Oscars.
1151961	1159908	I think 15, 20 years later, they re-released it in 3D and it would be similar to giving it an Oscar for visual effects again.
1160529	1161530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1177890	1181631	People are going to have to buy Elden Ring in order to play the DLC.
1181711	1185572	So if people want to explore this game, they're going to have to buy the base game.
1185612	1191714	And it's almost like it's getting that bump in sales, that uplift in sales, that recognition twice.
1192154	1194455	And yeah, it's taking it away from somebody else.
1194995	1202157	And whether that somebody else is a AAA title like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth or an indie title like Bellatro, which...
1205648	1207789	I don't understand the hype behind Bellatro.
1207849	1208409	I'm going to say it.
1208489	1213290	And yes, I've played the game and it did not land for me the way it's been landing for everybody else.
1213670	1217331	That being said, I'm happy to see an indie studio in the running.
1217731	1221792	A lot of people clearly seem to enjoy it and it clicked for people the way it didn't click for me.
1222212	1224972	So I can say I'm happy to see the game in there.
1225312	1226572	I'm happy for its fans.
1226673	1228753	And I would rather see a studio like that
1229153	1236841	Take the Game of the Year award, then the Elden Ring Studio will take that award home for the second time for the same product.
1237962	1239104	Yeah.
1239264	1242207	Best Game Direction, ironically, the same list.
1243448	1247092	Well, that's not that different from like the Oscars and Best Director.
1247152	1249395	Sometimes there'll be like one that changes, but that's...
1251127	1254528	Yeah, the director's the one that oversees a lot of the package.
1254548	1255688	It's not that surprising, to be honest.
1255988	1258829	I want to get some comments in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1259589	1262570	E3VL says, it's like if a movie made an extended cut.
1262630	1263270	Yeah, exactly.
1265111	1268692	Even the Richard Donner edition of Superman 2, I don't think it was nominated for anything.
1268712	1269852	It was still the same movie.
1269912	1277314	Although I would say, if anything, when you completely deconstruct or reconstruct a movie, maybe, but y'all get my point.
1278054	1304210	uh Dark2CS says I agree with Rob they got their trophy let someone else have one this year and I wouldn't even care if From Software got another trophy for a different product I wouldn't care yeah like I said put put have a category yeah that's like best DLC or something like that if you want to do their best expansion or something but I mean the fact that they've gotten I mean they have some down especially when we get down to the very bottom of the list here you know where it's like
1305342	1306103	Like this one right here.
1306363	1307725	Most anticipated game.
1307845	1309287	That's a throwaway category.
1309367	1310108	Who cares?
1310869	1314393	What are we judging the best hype machine that's coming out?
1315855	1317217	What are the game awards, Loki?
1318919	1320561	I mean, it is a hype machine, I guess.
1320641	1322022	But it's just stupid.
1322163	1324686	I just... I don't...
1325399	1326140	I don't care.
1326300	1330523	Like, I just don't really want to see that stuff.
1330543	1332545	And Bobby Blackwolf says, yes, it's GTA 6.
1332985	1337309	Which, by the way, I believe will be the big, like, reveal.
1337769	1339091	I mean, yes, we've already seen it.
1339211	1340832	I think we're going to get another taste.
1340892	1345736	I think that's my bet for the Game Awards trailer that's going to have everybody going, oh my god!
1346177	1349159	You know, after the GTA 6 update for life.
1349259	1349459	Sure.
1349880	1350540	And I'll eat it up.
1350600	1351061	I'm fine with that.
1351081	1351641	I know you will.
1351661	1352282	I know.
1353739	1354880	I want to get some other comments though.
1355701	1360605	S200Matt says, I feel like it should be lumped into best ongoing game than game of the year.
1360766	1363068	DLC equals ongoing support in my mind.
1363188	1363808	I could see that.
1365410	1375499	You know, an interesting comment too on that category because who wasn't there was World of Warcraft, which, you know, they haven't been there for years and years, but there's several people that would argue that
1376019	1401726	wow's recent expansion has really brought that game out of a rut and it's really pushed things forward and they've been doing a lot for their 20th anniversary and so forth and that maybe they deserve some flowers for it this year but they didn't get it maybe because the game's so fucking old at this point i don't know but just something i noticed uh some yeah but you know who's not in best ongoing gaming despite the fact that they keep giving us brand new dlc free over and over and over and over again isn't in there no man sky's not in there
1401946	1404587	To be fair, they've been in there almost every other year.
1404867	1406367	And I'm going to keep it 100.
1406447	1407268	I'm going to keep it 100.
1408588	1410749	Yes, No Man's Sky has been delivering on the DLC.
1410789	1411629	They do a great job.
1412409	1413970	Not as much this year as the last few years.
1414230	1415630	Because they're working on a new game.
1415910	1417731	They probably just don't have as many people on it.
1418191	1421332	Is Final Fantasy XIV in there?
1422212	1422932	It is.
1423392	1427774	While I think that's great, and I love XIV...
1429380	1455027	The Endwalker Cycle was not great at the end and Dawn Trail as an expansion is fine but it's not as good as their prior expansions Speaking of best ongoing games as we were talking about it Destiny 2 The Final Shape which that's also technically DLC or expansion or something like that Diablo 4, Final Fantasy 14 Fortnite and Helldivers 2 I would actually say Diablo 4 has done a better job last year than 14
1456533	1457314	of the games I play.
1458294	1463457	You don't know how much they have tweaked Diablo 4 and how fucking well that game has been uplifted in the last year.
1463678	1465619	It's in an incredible state right now.
1466719	1467080	Let's see.
1467140	1469001	I guess I'm just a fan, biased, whatever.
1469881	1470922	Best narrative.
1470962	1480628	So, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, Metaphor Re-Fantasio, Senua's Saga Hellblade 2, and Silent Hill 2.
1481209	1481629	Mm-hmm.
1482418	1498457	you have a couple games in there so there was an interesting comment here from ZenMonkey11 and I want to get to this because I think this is a valid perspective from the other side saying only way I would agree that DLC shouldn't get game of the year is if there is another game that should be there
1499338	1520463	and kind of, I take from that comment, kind of insinuating that you know what, overall the quality of games this year we're not looking at the same type of year we've had in years past this is not, you know, that DLC made it because other games weren't up to the bar however, I would say you probably named three other games in there
1521414	1524956	that maybe I think people would accept as a game of the year.
1525016	1527897	Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth, I think was very well received.
1528358	1529238	I'm kind of surprised.
1529298	1532940	I mean, as much as they overhyped Hellblade 2, I'm surprised that one isn't in there.
1533921	1535502	And then what was the other one you said?
1537423	1538023	The last one.
1538583	1539264	Silent Hill 2.
1539424	1540024	Yeah, Silent Hill 2.
1540264	1547008	A lot of people thought that was really... But then I guess we'd be asked this, should a remake be game of the year?
1547028	1547108	Yeah.
1547850	1548951	you know that we'd be having that conversation.
1548971	1577128	I mean obviously because Final Fantasy 7 you know is in there again so I mean that makes sense that it being that it is a remake I would say not a remaster a remaster should not be in there a remake yes because it is technically a new game maybe just like saying you know like you know a new Batman movie of remaking Batman or something for the millionth time you know should that not be considered for an Oscar or something like that um
1577648	1578869	Well, obviously it should.
1579069	1581130	I can tell you the other game, it hasn't come up yet.
1581770	1587613	DarkSakura knows the other game that people are saying ought to be in that game of the year discussion.
1588194	1592076	There's another recent release that people are saying ought to be in that discussion.
1592936	1593837	It's not Veilguard.
1596098	1598799	It is Veilguard from, you know, but that's, you know, again.
1598819	1600020	But it's not that great.
1602018	1605679	I mean, don't get me wrong, I love it, but it has so many problems with it.
1605759	1607240	The writing is not great.
1607680	1608140	Interesting.
1608280	1608640	Alright.
1610001	1617904	Art Direction, Astro Bot, Black Myth, Wukong, Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erd Tree, Metaphor, Refantasio, and Neva.
1620444	1621185	Let's see.
1621365	1630568	Music and score, Astro Bot, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Metaphor, Silent Hill 2, and Stellar Blade.
1632753	1656254	um let's see a lot of these are a lot of the same stuff uh Call of Duty Black Ops 6 for best audio design um Astro Bot, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Sending With Saga Hellblade 2 and Silent Hill 2 uh performances so uh voice acting and whatnot and performance capture uh Brianna White from Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uh Hannah Tell from Life is Strange Double Exposure
1656894	1661480	Humbly, uh, or Humberly Gonzalez for Star Wars Outlaws.
1661640	1672894	There's a game that, I mean, I don't know if it did that well, but, uh, Luke Roberts, Silent Hill 2, and Melina, uh, Jurgens for Sinuous Saga 2, uh, Hellblade 2.
1675311	1676372	Let's see here.
1676392	1679835	I don't know if we should go through all of these real quick.
1680356	1683979	Accessibility.
1683999	1684619	How about Indie?
1685040	1687702	Yeah, let's do Games for Impact.
1687722	1689083	Which we know which one will win.
1689564	1691105	Because it's the DLC.
1691365	1692847	Or I'm sorry, it's in the game of the year.
1693267	1694208	But we know which one will win.
1694228	1695289	But what are the other ones nominated?
1696392	1725545	uh, so indie, actually funny enough, it is, uh, so indie game, we have Animal Well um, Bolotro uh, Lorelei and Laser Eyes which, that looked pretty good, uh, Neva and UFO 50 and then uh, community support though Nomad Sky is in that one, so Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy 14, Fortnite Helldivers 2, and Nomad Sky for best community support, so I get that, you know feels right, um
1728294	1736859	Mobile Game AFK Journey, Baltro, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket Weathering Waves, Zenless Zone Zero
1745484	1768448	I actually think the cutoff for the nominations is like maybe like a week before they come out it's like November 15th it's pretty fucking late in the game because uh you know why they want people they want to cover the period through Black Friday and all the game releases it's always been like that because sometimes the big games of the year like especially a Nintendo side they don't hit until like that Friday before Black Friday
1769168	1771150	So I know the cutoff is all the way out there.
1771270	1776374	So, you know, they may have gotten a preview of that game, you know, the influencers on that.
1776454	1781338	And I will say, I've been playing a shit ton of that pocket trading card game.
1782999	1784900	It's a well done dopamine machine.
1786321	1786902	It's, yeah.
1787302	1789484	So I can't say I'm shocked to hear it in there.
1790103	1792665	Alright, let's talk about some games that we haven't mentioned yet.
1792746	1801974	So, Best Action Adventure, we have Astro Bot, Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown, Silent Hill 2, and Star Wars Outlaws.
1803816	1814726	Best Role Playing Game, Dragon's Dogma 2, Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, and Metaphor Refantasio.
1815387	1821449	It's funny that three of those are remakes or like DLC or remakes.
1823890	1824750	Best fighting game.
1824790	1829251	Now this feels weird too because these are all old games or at least this one is.
1829611	1834233	So we have Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics.
1834893	1835653	None of those are new.
1837014	1844456	Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Granblue Fantasy vs. Rising, Multiverses, and Tekken 8.
1846087	1853810	Yeah, I don't know if the Marvel's... It's a good collection, but really, I guess it's scraping the barrel for fighting games, I guess.
1854030	1858812	I hate to say it, but it really does feel like this year the awards are really going to be the sideshow.
1859172	1873478	And this is really just about the hype machine of whatever trailers are going to be showing off and whatever other stunts he's going to be pulling this year with, you know, people, celebrities that show up to do whatever, special dedications or whatever.
1873518	1874579	It just really feels like...
1875399	1875659	Mm-mm-mm-mm
1898115	1914301	and then let's do best family games so mostly Nintendo but not all Nintendo so we've got Astro Bot Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom The Plucky Squire Princess Peach Showtime and Super Mario Party Jamboree
1916202	1922446	SSJ 100 Matt reminds us jury voting is 90% of the vote and you can see a list of those sites on the Game Awards site.
1922867	1925929	Fan votes are 10% and that is a good thing.
1927310	1929291	Fans should not have 100% of the vote.
1930051	1934494	Look at any story about Metacritic bombing and all that bullshit.
1934955	1935975	The fan vote should be 5%.
1936116	1939478	The fan vote should be tie-breaking only.
1941199	1953967	The shockingly large percentage of people, and it really should be much smaller, that just get like butthurt about, you know, pronouns.
1955688	1956328	Like, come on.
1956789	1957289	Come on, man.
1957349	1959530	No, those people should not be voting on Game of the Year.
1959810	1960451	I'm right there with you.
1962476	1982727	best adaptation and this I think is pretty close with some of the stuff that they've got here so Arcane great series, Fallout excellent series, Knuckles didn't watch it but I hear it's good I'm definitely gonna go see the new Sonic movie Like a Dragon, Yakuza Tomb Raider, The Legend of Warcraft wait I heard that wasn't good
1983881	1985664	Well, right, I didn't say that one was good.
1986545	1989108	Okay, to be fair, you did kind of gloss past that one.
1989128	1991510	You did say all the others were good, and then you said, well, that one was there too.
1991591	1992031	Not you.
1993132	1993553	Not you.
1997838	2001683	Yeah, so, yeah, there's more, like, esports stuff as well.
2001723	2002503	Like, I don't know.
2004155	2004535	Cool.
2004575	2004735	Cool.
2022202	2023925	I think Black Myth Wukong.
2024746	2025206	Really?
2026308	2029052	I just heard that some people straight up hated that game.
2029252	2031415	So I feel like that's a controversial choice.
2032376	2033498	I hope it doesn't go to Elden Ring.
2034219	2035560	I hope it doesn't go to Elden Ring either.
2036582	2038464	I guess Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
2040305	2041206	I'd be fine with that.
2041246	2042407	Or Astro Bot.
2042447	2043868	I hope Astro Bot takes it.
2043888	2045270	I'd love to see Astro Bot.
2046871	2049994	I think Astro Bot would be a great, great win for the year.
2050354	2055059	Especially the way they've really got that magic.
2055079	2059823	For everybody who's ever said, I wish they would release Mario on the PlayStation 5.
2060464	2065468	It's like, okay, you have Astro Bot, which is just as good.
2066289	2087346	or just like just to just get out of this mindset that we have to create all these like Dark Souls clone games like can we just not can something else win like can we differentiate you know our library of games that are released in the years like so many of these are like oh it's a Souls like it's a Souls like oh stop
2088632	2090073	Put out something new, please.
2090874	2093016	Bobby Blackwolf says Bellatro will win it.
2094036	2098700	Again, I would love to see that because I would love what that would mean for the indie developers and so forth.
2098780	2102023	And I think we need a year where an indie kind of snatches the prize.
2102683	2107948	And especially in a year where DLC is going to be nominated, I think that would be a very interesting thing to see.
2108088	2113472	Again, but it's so weird because I can sit here and go, I mean, the game didn't really land for me, but cool.
2114353	2117515	I can still root it on for what it stands for, I guess.
2117996	2118256	Mm-hmm.
2120664	2125232	Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that did land for us this week.
2125412	2131002	Or actually, I want to talk about one that didn't, but we'll talk about the types of games we've been playing this week in our gaming week.
2131463	2132545	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
2133895	2139561	Um, well, I played Dead by Daylight, which was, you know, Dead by Daylight.
2140221	2149651	I've been trying to play a lot of Spirit in 2v8, and I'm slowly getting my groove back with playing her, so it's been kind of fun.
2150131	2155416	Although, I think I have more fun just farming and memeing around than actually playing seriously these days.
2155436	2156217	Yeah.
2156597	2180053	um there's people who just take that game way too seriously um I also played uh Dragon Age Veilguard which I am enjoying don't get me wrong it's just there's there's there's problems the writing is just not great there's continuity issues it's like there's all this lore that they said we're just gonna look at like a third of it yeah that'll be fine um
2181505	2187110	I also played Polya, which I do, the Suica game.
2191113	2193836	I played a little bit with my Vroid thing today.
2194036	2197639	I mean, it's more of a model maker, but it's kind of fun to me like a game.
2198680	2204545	And yeah, it's been a really stupidly, redonkulously busy week.
2205686	2206046	All right.
2206747	2208468	Well, we'll move on to Loki.
2208488	2209149	How was your gaming week?
2210280	2235829	it's basically just Minecraft but speaking of Minecraft there was a new movie trailer put out an actual trailer not the teaser this time and it looks it looks better I think some people still hate it I mean I'll still go see it but yeah they're leaning into like memes and stuff like that because it has the line you know as a child I yearned for the mines so it's silly
2238538	2241002	But yeah, it's pretty much just a final... It was just...
2243752	2244713	Minecraft this week.
2245053	2247454	Mainly working on the theme park stuff.
2247615	2253979	A lot of setup for all the plushies and stuff that I was adding to the game because it's essentially on the back end of a resource pack.
2254059	2256921	It's setting up 110 models.
2258342	2271991	Thankfully I built models that use player skins so I just had to get our player skins that we were using and alt skins and just dump them in there and then I could link them to the different models that I would create using Blockbench and everything.
2273512	2294191	and then setting that all up in game and setting up all the redstone in game and building all that and the filming at least didn't take very long although I had to re-film stuff because my wife is during the day and so my wife was on a like a call and my mic was picking up audio from that I was like dang it so I had to redo some of that um
2295063	2297745	So it was a little bit of a mess, but yeah, it turned out pretty good.
2297845	2302209	And then like, uh, the mini game, the new mini fishing mini game was pretty fun.
2302229	2311757	Uh, we may have to, uh, cheat in some invulnerable, uh, basically, uh, rods with no durability, um,
2312589	2334178	on them or without you know taking durability you can make some invulnerable ones because uh every time you play the game like it essentially just toasts one of those enchanted fishing rods it's gonna be a pain to keep to have you know fixing those up every time so we may have to just out of the sake of my sanity and maintaining that game just you know
2334742	2340510	We'll throw one of those in there so that it's not a problem for people visiting the park and everything after it's all done.
2353266	2360508	What they're doing this year, we have the cast members, which are the folks that make videos and YouTube content and stuff like that.
2360548	2364369	And then we have supporting cast, which are people that play with us that don't make content.
2364970	2369651	And they have their own area, but they also are working on the end of season project.
2369671	2378033	So they have a giant build that we haven't seen yet that they're working on that's going to be our finale that we go to this place.
2378654	2379094	And so...
2380151	2405205	that's been pretty fun but they've now finished that and they have like two months left and so he's coming to help out with the theme park he's building like a Wild West area and like you want to do an aquarium and so that's kind of we're filling in stuff in the park and he helped out a lot with the build that I'm working on right now a lot of the terraforming for that because I was just struggling to get it I just couldn't
2405905	2407046	Thank you for watching!
2430663	2431103	It's big.
2431123	2432724	It wasn't supposed to be this big.
2435426	2445331	TigerClaw in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network has kind of a question that I've been marinating on for you as well, which is what are your thoughts on the new Minecraft movie trailer that came out this last week?
2446280	2448722	Right, as I said, I thought it looked pretty good.
2448802	2451063	Yeah, there's a new trailer.
2451723	2455886	It gave us a little bit of the backstory of some of the characters.
2455906	2461149	So obviously the one that... Oh, what's his name?
2463691	2464831	I can't think of his name now.
2465172	2465612	Aquaman.
2466032	2468033	Oh, Jason Momoa.
2468234	2469254	Jason Momoa, thank you.
2469975	2475178	Jason Momoa's character plays like... He's kind of like a... Was it a...
2476933	2491141	like a arcade champ type you know like a Billy Mitchell type character sort of but not you know this essentially like he was a big like oh I got a high score back in you know 89 but you know I'll really focus on that
2491835	2506489	and just like you know the kid is a modder he's like kind of like a person that makes modded stuff in the game and I don't know who the other two people are yet or how they get there but essentially you know there's like
2507330	2516295	Somehow Steve gets into this Minecraft world and then he's kind of living there now and then they get in kind of the same way and now they have to get out at some point.
2516635	2517576	But yeah, I think it looks good.
2517596	2525921	I mean, I would have preferred it to be animated, obviously, but it looks more interesting than what we initially saw.
2526741	2530123	But there are still a lot of things that are like Uncanny Valley, kind of weird.
2530583	2534786	But I trust that they'll do the best that they can with it.
2535646	2536367	and we'll see.
2536407	2539208	If it sucks, we'll just call it like it is, you know?
2540469	2541750	I mean, yes, it's still animated.
2541770	2543371	There's a lot computer animated in it.
2543391	2544651	Yes, technically true.
2545092	2549614	But I wish it was fully computer animated instead of like green screen stuff for a lot of this.
2549694	2549854	But...
2552627	2572861	there are a lot of actual sets and stuff the behind the scenes stuff that they are talking about the work that's going into it with Weta and everything is very there's a lot of effort going in it's not just like, oh it's a quick cash grab they are really trying to do all this stuff and make it look great
2573345	2575911	So, you know, hopefully it turns out great.
2576372	2577595	I will see it either way.
2577735	2578637	I mean, you know what?
2578658	2580582	There's like a lot of movies that you never know.
2580662	2581945	Like, look at Sonic the Hedgehog.
2581985	2582687	Perfect example.
2584281	2606635	when we first saw that I was like oh it's gonna be alright but it's a good movie like I've really enjoyed the last two movies and I'm looking forward to the third one I'm not even really a Sonic the Hedgehog fan I'm just aware of that franchise like I you know it wasn't one of the games I played it's too fast but it's I don't know it looks fun alright cool
2608149	2608870	All right, my gaming week.
2609490	2612712	You know, admittedly, a lot of the similar types of stuff I've been playing.
2612732	2615654	Final Fantasy XIV, I had another friend of mine that recently got into it.
2615694	2618296	So we've been, you know, buddying up, doing some dungeons and things like that.
2618336	2620237	And I finally hit my Black Mage, hit 100.
2620377	2622358	So, you know, I've been working on that.
2622939	2628042	And let's see, also been playing Diablo 4, even though I swore I was done with it.
2628262	2628642	I don't know.
2628702	2629383	It's still very...
2629983	2630203	Diablo 4
2657546	2667465	as far as other new games is played this week I gotta talk about Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 because that released this week and I don't know
2669147	2696853	I'm not happy with the way it turned out and that really sucks to say because I want to like I loved Flight Simulator 2020 was so good like it was just so neat because you didn't have to know a lot about like flying the planes or anything there were these modes that would just throw you right into flying into certain areas and then like you would also it was very easy like it would come up on the screen like if you would just want to say like say I want to do like oh I want to fly from the Sacramento airport to
2697313	2698594	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2718060	2744363	I tried to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, wouldn't even work the first night because I guess the servers were getting slammed so hard because I know they lessened the amount of download in this game because I think a lot more of the assets are online than they were the first time I'm sure they're leaning more into the Azure streaming and all that stuff and of course you can never accurately predict the demand for that type of thing and those servers were slammed
2745063	2755573	I was able to play it the next day at night and it takes a long time to load probably because it's downloading all of that data when you fire it up, whatever.
2757022	2758523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2777802	2799282	but then like I was trying to do the custom flight and I had a really hard time doing it and I couldn't even figure out how to get autopilot to take over for me like I'm sure it's very easy but it wasn't as easy or intuitive as it was in 2020 and then I was like well I think there's this whole mode where you can like get out of the plane and like walk around and I did that a little bit and it kind of
2800539	2804701	Maybe it's because I was trying to do it in my neighborhood.
2804741	2807943	It's probably more meant for foresty areas and mountain areas.
2808323	2812065	It doesn't look good in urban areas.
2812605	2815266	Because the building information is just not all there.
2815386	2820929	I guess I couldn't expect it to be there, but it kind of looked bad, to be quite honest.
2822069	2824250	And then I tried to do a photo mode.
2824350	2825171	And again, the game...
2825751	2835358	wasn't really helping me on how to take a photo, even in the first mission, which is supposed to be easy to take a photo of the pyramids in Egypt and this whole thing.
2835398	2838920	And I just, I'm going to be, I'm going to be 100% with y'all.
2839580	2840881	2020 was a better experience.
2841302	2843843	I would rather just go back and play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
2844824	2845785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2862085	2862946	Thank you for watching!
2880083	2880863	I don't know what to say.
2881383	2893566	I'm really disappointed because I feel like this studio makes good games and I feel like obviously you see the internet is just tearing them a new one over all the downtime that this game had with its launch and so forth.
2894106	2903349	And I feel like there's, you know, maybe people don't necessarily feel exactly the same way I do, but I think there are quite a few people that are saying, so what's really the upgrade over 2020?
2907745	2908285	Womp womp.
2909165	2909726	So I don't know.
2910006	2910586	I don't know, y'all.
2911946	2912666	I can't recommend it.
2912946	2918608	I mean, if you have Game Pass or cloud streaming, I mean, I guess it's, what do you have to lose?
2919328	2921809	But go play 2020.
2923549	2931231	The maps are the same because the neighborhood I was trying to explore wasn't built in the 2020 maps.
2931251	2932731	And in 2024, it's still not built.
2940208	2942070	Anyway, so that's my thoughts on that.
2943111	2945493	Alright, well with that we'll get into some more gaming news.
2945994	2953021	Just a quick housekeeping note, we will not be here on December 15th.
2953321	2954883	I will be out of town, so I will not be here.
2954923	2956004	So no show December 15th.
2956705	2957726	Right after the Game Awards.
2958464	2984863	sorry uh we're not sorry uh we will oh shit that means I can't do the broadcast Bobby was talking about earlier because that means that's the night of Thursday night is the night I fly out womp womp oh well I guess I'll catch up on all of that when I uh land we'll see well Loki you could do it Bobby if you're around or Jamie if you're around Thursday night you should do it yeah
2985458	2987859	Alright, let's move on to some gaming news.
2987959	2988739	Loki, start us off.
2989739	3003484	Alright, so Sony is in talks to purchase the parent company of From Software, Tunesoft, and other companies under the subsidiary of Kadokawa Corporation.
3004544	3009706	And apparently this is definitely happening because Kadokawa has confirmed that
3010226	3039063	they have received an initial letter of intent to acquire the company's shares from Sony but they haven't made a decision regarding that if there are facts that should be announced in the future we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate manner so it's not like official official but all signs point to it's in the process I mean essentially that the intent from Sony has been Sony has said yes we would like to purchase you and they're like
3040589	3041429	Well, we're going to think about it.
3042390	3045331	DJ Ranma S sounds very confident it won't happen in chat.
3046592	3047832	I mean, we'll see.
3048192	3051934	It is a very, it's a much, this is much bigger than FromSoftware.
3052234	3058377	And I understand why Rama's commenting on this because this is, for the anime market, this is huge.
3059157	3064039	You know, and Sony has their hands in things beyond video games with entertainment and all of that.
3064139	3065700	And so, and Kadokawa,
3066540	3070862	is, like, they don't just have from software, they have all these movies, anime, stuff.
3071042	3095671	Anime, tourism, video streaming, Japanese game development, yeah, they have, like, Spike Chunsoft, which did Danganronpa, and Mystery Dungeon, also Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Acquire, who did, you know, it was co-developed Octopath Traveler, and just did development on Mario & Luigi Brothership,
3096811	3104897	Also in like anime, you know, there's Doga Kobe, NG, Globovision and others, Anime News Network.
3106527	3132898	it's a lot, a lot of stuff Ranma in chat says if Sony does acquire Kadokawa, it would put Sony in a majority control of the anime industry there's probably going to be a lot of eyeballs on this, you know, again, I don't know what I'm not going to attempt to even know what antitrust laws in Japan look like but this merger, hardly any to my knowledge this merger might feel like it's almost too big, so I don't know we'll see yeah
3134366	3154520	yeah um any thoughts though since you know a lot of gamers are looking at this from the from software standpoint and the you know the Spike Chunsoft and that as well any thoughts about that end of it what you know if if Sony acquiring from software kind of changes the game at all or anything like that
3155618	3158839	I mean, it's a big deal with the series here.
3158919	3168604	I just don't think we're going to see certainly none of the United States Congress or whatever is going to make a big deal about it, even though it is a big franchise or something.
3169944	3172806	And certainly, would Sony be multi-platform with those?
3173086	3173886	Probably not.
3175227	3178128	I guarantee that they would.
3178148	3179689	PC, the ultimate multi-platform.
3179789	3179949	Yeah.
3180928	3190830	So, yeah, I mean, like, as, you know, and as Joe and Hunter Matt says, it makes me wonder if Sony just wants to buy part of the company, like Disney buying part of 20th Century Fox.
3191310	3192050	Probably.
3193091	3198212	But as to what part, I don't necessarily think it's the From Software part specifically.
3198252	3198732	It could be.
3199472	3202413	But remember, there's a lot of elements of Kadokawa that...
3203573	3206276	It could be under negotiation here.
3207598	3211562	You know, I guess it's easy to jump to the conclusion that Sony wants Elden Ring.
3211883	3214105	You know, From Software has kind of knocked it out of the park.
3214185	3214646	I feel like...
3216018	3218781	I feel like From Software has already done a lot for Sony.
3219001	3227610	Between Bloodborne, between Demon's Souls and the re-release, they've done a lot for Sony that wasn't necessarily on Xbox in the first place.
3228090	3233976	So maybe this makes it a little more official, but I don't know if this really changes the game.
3234897	3252012	yes, Elden Ring was a huge title it was one huge title and I don't think it necessarily just because Sony acquires from software it necessarily shifts the balance of gaming as dramatically as Microsoft getting Activision you know what I mean?
3252673	3261301	and even Danganronpa these are all games that tend to perform better on PlayStation anyway I don't know, we'll see
3262383	3262723	We'll see.
3263103	3267005	I'm a little bit with Ranma that I question if this actually happens.
3267486	3282993	I feel like there's, yeah, either it's a portion of it they really want control over, but yeah, I just, I feel like the company that gets made out of both of these owning each other is just too, it's too much control, especially in the anime side of things.
3283434	3288176	Yeah, and I think, like, in the case of Activision, I know we were kind of rooting for that to happen before,
3288616	3299463	originally because we hated Bobby Kotek but like I think in general these companies that aren't necessarily in financial trouble
3301222	3302884	We don't really need these acquisitions.
3303985	3312054	Nothing good has come from this mass mergers of all these different companies into one giant company.
3312094	3315177	You just have essentially less competition at that point.
3316058	3320482	And while that benefits those corporations, it doesn't benefit the consumer.
3321420	3340489	and we see what happens with that when large corporations have lots of money and then get in the pockets of politicians I don't expect the US government over the next four years to give a damn about any of this they have more racist things to do I think you're going to see tons of mergers just because the US government isn't going to fucking care um
3341249	3342531	And that's just the sad reality.
3343352	3348518	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I think the anime and manga part is the bigger story and FromSoftware is an afterthought.
3348598	3349379	I don't disagree.
3349739	3355105	You know, a lot of the gaming media and blogs and stuff are obviously focused on that part of it because it is an impact.
3355506	3359771	But I do agree with the – I think, yes, I think the reasons why it doesn't happen –
3360291	3363295	is more on the anime and manga part than from software.
3363335	3364016	Yes, for sure.
3364677	3371066	Bobby says, it's just, will governments care about anime monopoly the same way they cared about game streaming monopolies?
3371166	3374571	And again, I think after January 20th, the US doesn't.
3377074	3377635	So we'll see.
3379421	3380702	um it's the U.S.
3380762	3394891	government will all all be about the rich getting richer yes it's gonna be the EU the EU will be the ones that that yeah Bobby points out the EU yeah I would agree with that the EU is gonna have to do something to to um change the game but we'll see
3396516	3397336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3422069	3423770	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3441786	3443547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3464543	3479277	and shit that probably works better on mobile um and yeah there's a little trailer that you can see about that and all that uh and you know other than that we don't know a lot else about it except in a follow-up interview with Famitsu Naoki Yoshida said
3479918	3480719	It's free to play.
3481179	3482200	There's no gotcha.
3482701	3487926	But there will be outfits and mounts you can purchase on the in-game shops.
3488427	3494112	And in a quote said, the monetization will be such that all players can enjoy the game for a long time.
3494793	3501399	And I mean, I could also see that just building an awareness of Fama SE 14 and getting people hooked on it draws more people into it.
3502563	3509938	I don't see how this game will be any fun on a mobile platform when it's very action based however
3511616	3520600	The clever thought I had was, what if they made Final Fantasy XIV a more traditional turn-based battle system?
3521200	3523041	And that was the mobile game we got.
3523421	3524962	No, don't do this to me.
3524982	3530665	It was like Final Fantasy XIV graphics, but the game plays like classic Final Fantasy.
3531185	3533166	I don't think that's where it ends up.
3534332	3535796	I was just thinking, I have an iPad, what's the problem?
3544939	3548863	I'm still hoping for Eleven, but I know that's never happening.
3549524	3554909	Well, but we know Eleven Mobile was in development at one point and then suddenly wasn't.
3555409	3558152	So it is interesting that this is a thing now instead.
3558672	3563357	So one could argue that maybe some of the things that they were looking at for Eleven are going to be for this.
3563457	3563837	Who knows?
3564237	3565198	It's really hard to say.
3565238	3565619	We don't know.
3569157	3597517	but we'll see you know details again are very light I'd like to see more about gameplay because if it's very action based and dodging you know the servers as it is in the game can sometimes you know people have trouble dodging things and stuff like that so I don't know how that translates to a mobile version of the game I really am rooting for something turn based I think it would I think yeah merge the awesome story of Final Fantasy 14 with classic Final Fantasy and I really think you'll have a winning formula
3598530	3599230	but what do I know?
3599911	3601492	I'm just a dummy with a podcast.
3602912	3604413	Let's talk about other classic games.
3604613	3605614	DarkSakura, what do you have?
3607194	3626384	Well, the producer for Dragon Quest 3 has made some interesting statements in an interview including wanting to see a remake of Final Fantasy 6 done in the same style that the Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D was done.
3628625	3637047	He's quoted saying that they don't have concrete plans, but would love to say that the next one coming out would be Final Fantasy VI.
3638588	3641849	But, of course, it's not official.
3641889	3644049	There's nothing really solid in the work.
3644669	3647530	But they were very proud of Octopath Traveler.
3647910	3650551	I was just the first in that style and wanted to keep going with it.
3653293	3657936	I'm kind of with DarkTetsuya in chat who says, I wouldn't say no to Final Fantasy VI done in that style.
3658376	3660417	Yeah, and I love Final Fantasy VI, don't get me wrong.
3660577	3662839	We just had the pixel remasters.
3663179	3664020	Just had that.
3664580	3673266	And I want to say the opera scene felt very like it was lifted out of the...
3674818	3676019	Octopath Traveler Engine.
3676139	3678442	Like it didn't feel like you were in the pixel remaster.
3678462	3679563	It felt like it was a different thing.
3679963	3681384	So it's just weird to me.
3681404	3686289	You know, I feel like it's an offhanded comment the guy made that now like, you know, people are running everywhere.
3686349	3687871	Oh my God, Final Fantasy 6 Remastered.
3688451	3690573	You know, people are running a little bit too wild with it.
3691074	3692936	I'm also kind of sitting here going and
3693516	3704078	Y'all know the history I've made on this program with my comments on the game Chrono Trigger, which is a game I like, but I feel a lot of people over-inflate it a bit, but that's my opinion.
3705699	3707439	I can also sit here and say, you know what?
3707539	3709800	It's time Chrono Trigger fans get their due.
3710040	3711260	Remake Chrono Trigger already.
3711740	3713840	Do Chrono Trigger in this engine.
3713920	3714761	It's what people want.
3714841	3715361	Give it to them.
3716181	3717741	We just had Final Fantasy VI.
3717781	3718501	We don't need it again.
3719522	3720202	Do Chrono Trigger.
3720322	3720682	It's fine.
3722298	3744945	that's where my brain is at but maybe he can't say that maybe it's easier for him to say Final Fantasy 6 because it's the furthest thing from what they would actually make right now maybe they are working on other types of games he just doesn't want to give the hints on that maybe Final Fantasy 6 was a easy thing for him to say because that would be the game they're least working on right now if that makes sense
3745563	3764258	and maybe it's all speculation that is a big part of it too but I think we'll continue to see this engine deliver us a few more remakes so Live Alive did really well I think so we'll see Mike Def says what Rob wants is a Super Metroid done in the Dread style no
3766970	3768432	I just want another 2D Metroid.
3769133	3770675	And Dread was fine.
3770955	3777402	I didn't love how... I didn't love some of the survival elements of it, but it was good enough.
3777783	3778284	I enjoyed it.
3778864	3779765	So, there's that.
3781247	3782609	Alright, moving on.
3782649	3782849	Loki.
3784676	3793000	Alright, so we have news now that the Xbox platform is going to allow you to have a little bit more freedom when it comes to streaming games.
3793501	3799544	So originally, if you wanted to do the game streaming with xCloud, you had to have Game Pass Ultimate.
3800444	3806447	Now with Game Pass, of course, you are limited to the games that are in that library, which could change over time.
3807068	3811010	And that doesn't necessarily allow you to stream games that say you have purchased.
3811710	3813891	but that may be changing.
3813971	3828180	So now they are testing something starting as of November 20th to allow people to be able to stream a limited number of games on Xbox if you own them.
3828741	3830982	It's like a list of 50 games so far.
3831582	3840508	The caveat right now is that it's not available in the Xbox PC app or on Xbox consoles but you can do it through the browser.
3840950	3842531	That is so weird to me, by the way.
3842952	3843832	But it's testing.
3843852	3844953	They're testing it right now.
3844973	3847095	So I don't think they're rolling it out, maybe.
3847435	3847756	I don't know.
3847896	3850097	Why doesn't the app launch a browser window?
3850378	3854501	It seems like a very easy bridge.
3854881	3857063	PC apps on an Xbox?
3857083	3858644	That's impossible.
3858784	3861306	Except it's a thing that it does.
3862427	3863208	But okay, okay.
3864109	3864509	Whatever.
3864529	3866491	I don't make the apps, so maybe I just don't know.
3867131	3870373	Can I launch Edge on the Xbox and stream through that?
3870833	3881839	You can launch Edge on the Xbox I don't know if you can stream through it I would feel like it's a little too demanding but I haven't tried it but yes, you can use Edge there is a version of Microsoft Edge for the Xbox
3883049	3907314	but anyways, it does support a limited number of games some notable stuff, obviously the recent release Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 which is a couple years old at this point the Final Fantasy games, the Pixel remasters I'm assuming because it's 1 through 6
3909034	3934985	and Hades Harry Potter Quidditch Champions Hogwarts Legacy although actually I'm sorry Hogwarts Legacy is on there as well yeah so it's a kind of a variety of different games that they're testing out right now and hopefully it expands to more later on yeah because I don't think I had a single game on the list I was like oh let me go see what game and I didn't have a single damn thing on the list
3935464	3937546	Well, you know... I mean, I have all the Game Pass stuff.
3937746	3939107	I've tested the classroom before.
3939167	3939567	It's fine.
3939587	3943430	Yeah, there's the future Game of the Year indie title, Baltros, on there.
3943630	3944571	So, Hades.
3944591	3946032	Which I bought on PlayStation.
3946172	3948533	So, you know, and again, Hades on PlayStation.
3949154	3951215	I guess I'm not buying enough games on Xbox, so...
3952216	3975341	which honestly I don't actually to be real I don't remember the last time I bought a game on Xbox because it's all been Game Pass I think it would have been Forza Horizon yes uh no I don't even think I did that because of Game Pass or I literally I bought it outright yeah I bought it outright for what is before I had Game Pass it was on
3976480	3978361	The actual console where... No, I'm sorry.
3978741	3983804	The last game I bought on Xbox actually was Red Dead Redemption 2 for my son to play.
3984185	3996812	Because he... Well, I mean, his computer can run it too, but he thought it didn't run it, and so he was playing it on Xbox for a while, and then I finally was like, you know your PC probably can run that.
3996872	3997692	And he's like, oh.
3998193	3998533	Oh, okay.
4000414	4000614	Funny.
4001150	4002291	He's played through the whole campaign.
4002691	4006072	Speaking of my kids, I am super proud of my kids when it comes to gaming.
4006112	4009594	So he's played through the whole campaign of Red Dead Redemption 2 already once.
4010014	4012795	And then now he's playing it again modded on the PC.
4013295	4019338	My other son, my youngest son, is beat Mario Kart 8 completely.
4019618	4022299	Just like completely decimated that game.
4022419	4022979	And now is...
4024600	4030852	Trying to get good at all the strats to get at the top of the leaderboards in time trials.
4030912	4033057	And he's like in top 11 on some of these.
4033277	4034459	Like, it's just ridiculous.
4035842	4036263	That's great.
4037850	4038130	All right.
4039771	4040151	Moving on.
4040371	4051136	Let's talk about if we talk about Microsoft Cloud, let's talk about the Sony Cloud and let's talk about what is happening there because some interesting updates there as well.
4052197	4056899	And cloud testing or cloud streaming testing has started.
4057499	4059241	on the PlayStation Portal.
4059702	4067530	Remember that device that came out some time ago and some people were like, well, it would be nice if we actually got actual cloud gaming on this thing.
4068011	4069192	Well, guess what?
4069332	4070193	You're going to get your wish.
4071294	4073537	If you have PlayStation Plus Premium...
4073877	4076479	So you have to have their version of Game Pass, basically.
4077039	4081002	It will allow you to access 120 PlayStation 5 titles instantly.
4081983	4086446	And so if you have a PlayStation Portal, it might be a nice little like, ooh, new feature unlocked, apparently.
4086987	4089809	So that's a cool little thing that they have put out there.
4090570	4095593	Control is one of the games you can play, and apparently they run pretty well on the device.
4096054	4097755	So, neat.
4100768	4103230	I guess cloud gaming really is the future in some ways.
4103430	4105712	I feel like too, especially with portable devices.
4106252	4107513	Why can't you have both?
4108814	4109474	I don't see why not.
4109955	4114438	I think portable devices still feel very limited too.
4114498	4118661	You can't really go outside with them because they need Wi-Fi to work.
4119321	4119582	But
4120578	4133853	As 5G, I feel, but I feel like I've been saying this for way too long and maybe I'm just like, but I, you know, as 5G gets more and more out there, it will be easier to do when you're not stuck in your house.
4134393	4138998	But I feel, again, I feel like I've been saying that for a long time now and it still hasn't happened.
4140320	4140480	So.
4143530	4144530	Anyway, moving on.
4144810	4147291	Well, E3VL in chat says, I worry about latency.
4147451	4149132	It would really depend on the game you're playing, right?
4149192	4152033	Especially, again, a game we've talked about a lot tonight, Bellatro.
4152673	4154254	Latency won't fucking matter in that game.
4154814	4156975	So it really depends on the game you're playing, I'm sure.
4157055	4165978	But I feel like people that have been playing this thing are, you know, a lot of the cloud stuff is getting better at, like, kind of predicting in advance what you might be doing.
4166038	4167179	And so it helps with...
4167779	4193929	the streaming is it actually tries to figure out different permutations of the game at once this is very interesting how it all works but yeah anyway moving on we'll talk about something a little older DarkSakura well a little older and maybe pretty new so there is going to be a new port for Atari 7800 plus it is
4198711	4222165	Bounty Bob Strikes Back which is a sequel to Port of the Miner or Port of the Miner 2049er there we go I can't make words happen it is Miner 2049er sequel Bounty Bob Strikes Back I can read, I swear it's also kind of a tongue twister name
4222765	4251262	blah blah blah blah blah it was a pretty influential platform game it was done by Bill Hogue and Big Five Software where you play a bounty named Bounty Bob going through Nuclear Ned's Uranium Mine to look for a criminal named Yukon Johan so you have to avoid enemies and stuff and traps and things on the game but now
4253132	4254537	There is a sequel.
4255179	4255782	You can get it.
4257126	4258892	And of course the...
4261019	4265682	The original was, I believe, was it a 5200 game?
4265802	4266502	I'm pretty sure it was.
4267863	4274447	Yeah, so that sequel did come out originally for the Atari 8-bit computers and did come on Atari 5200.
4275448	4278569	Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum.
4279670	4285173	But this is going to be a 7800 homebrew being developed by Robert DiCrescenzo.
4286314	4287675	And you can play it on the 7800 and the Atari 2600+.
4289756	4301467	You can get a physical copy for about $30 and it will come with the cartridge and box artwork from Kat Hudson and a cartridge sleeve and a printed manual.
4304930	4306251	We love all that fancy stuff.
4306491	4307432	How about Ninja Golf?
4307833	4310475	Oh, actually, Ninja Golf is getting republished.
4310635	4311016	I'm happy.
4312083	4329850	well okay hold on hold on hold on sidestep sidestep this is from last month but i didn't see this okay that's fine uh actually two months ago r-type running on a 70 did i cover this r-type running on a 7800 i don't recall i need this in my life
4332275	4343520	I was going to say, I feel like these Atari cartridges and homebrew, a lot of this has been growing because of the release of the 2600 Plus and these newer devices that are meant to play the older games.
4343560	4346402	It's almost like we have new things to make cartridges for.
4346782	4352485	You don't have to try to find a 7800 at a flea market or hope you still have a working one in a vault somewhere.
4352565	4354966	You can actually get a new device to play these.
4354986	4356166	Whether it's R-Type or minor...
4359648	4361209	Bounty Bob back.
4361449	4368572	You know, whether it's that, it's, you know, there's a place to play it very easily.
4369033	4369433	That's fun.
4372094	4375236	DarkSakura, did you get quiet because you're ordering that R-type cartridge?
4376296	4377137	I'm trying to find it.
4378257	4379078	I don't think it's out yet.
4379318	4381119	Do you have a 7800 in your vault?
4382519	4385701	Rob, you're asking me if I have the 7800.
4385741	4386061	I had to ask.
4388846	4392650	Surely there's some things you don't have that people would assume you have.
4393631	4395053	Somewhere I have one.
4395113	4396635	There we go.
4396695	4398256	Okay, I should rephrase my question.
4398757	4401160	Do you know where your Atari 7800 is?
4401180	4403402	I kind of do.
4404523	4405264	It's 10 o'clock.
4405304	4406285	Do you know where your Atari 7800 is?
4410084	4433675	uh the 50 and probably some with the 5200s so we have two 5200s the four port and the two port version that's a good that's a good bumper we had to do in the future it's 10 o'clock do you know where your atari 7800 is like animate my uh my virtual boy going for a walk and just bumping into it on an illicit uh you know alleyway hallway deal i'll just find a picture of the vault in your old house
4435771	4436692	Like that's not hard.
4436732	4438132	I think I've sent you a few of them.
4438152	4439593	We had a YouTube of it at some point.
4439613	4440934	It's probably still on the channel.
4441334	4443355	I don't, there's very few YouTubes I've removed.
4443395	4448418	I have a TikTok up of the garage right now, but actually from like a year ago.
4449639	4459264	I would still encourage people to go watch that TikTok of your garage because I think when we talk about like your pinball hobby, I don't think people really understand what that means.
4460145	4461526	It's hobby with a capital H.
4462574	4490849	I'll see if I can find it but it's like it's just like you know that's that's honestly that's really Dan's thing but at the same time you know I love it too I mean I'm I'm always gonna encourage him and I told him in no uncertain uh terms that he could not get rid of Ghostbusters he was trying to get rid of Ghostbusters traded out from under me and I'm like no that's in here I thought World Cup 94 was the not over my dead body thing
4491337	4493519	That is the absolute no way.
4494820	4497121	That and Theater of Magic.
4498963	4502745	Theater of Magic though is not a good one for tournament play I realized.
4504507	4506048	I found one of me playing Doctor Who.
4506548	4507529	Me playing Beatles.
4509030	4511912	I found the Metallica that got modified to play the Nyan Cat music.
4515455	4516055	That was fun.
4516095	4517036	That's California Extreme.
4517932	4523013	Alright, well let's go ahead and move on and we'll talk to Loki.
4523173	4524073	What do you have for us?
4525294	4543458	Yeah, so Steam has some new rules protecting consumers from unsavory corporations who would like to sell you that DLC and those game passes on promises and hopes and, you know, sometimes that doesn't materialize and you're like, ah, dang it.
4543818	4544698	I paid all this money.
4545118	4545999	What am I to do?
4546479	4551780	Well, now they are going to actually hold those companies to that.
4552240	4555541	So it says by offering a season pass, you are promising future content.
4556301	4563943	And in the process of launching a season pass, you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the season pass.
4564303	4568984	That launch timing is a commitment to both the consumers and Steam.
4570185	4580736	If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC and when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn't offer a season pass on Steam.
4581157	4589446	And if they break that promise with their roadmaps or whatever, the customers may automatically be refunded for that DLC.
4590728	4592951	So that is a nice thing that they're doing.
4593391	4597316	Steam being more consumer-friendly as time goes on.
4597896	4602482	We may not get Half-Life 3, but at least they're making a good marketplace on PC.
4602742	4607167	Yeah, I'm sure there's some corners that are going to be pretty unhappy with this news, especially in the development front.
4607187	4608489	Too fucking bad.
4608569	4610271	I say too fucking bad as well, because...
4611372	4613514	You know, especially these additions.
4613654	4621621	This is really, it feels like it's really targeting these $100 game additions, these big game additions trying to, you know, buy it now and get the season pass, all this stuff.
4621641	4622642	And we have seen it happen.
4622682	4626385	It's like the Kickstarters that promise a product that's then never delivered on.
4626746	4637835	You know, so I think this is a great way for Steam to hold these things accountable, that if you sell something, you're not selling something that doesn't exist or concepts of a plan.
4638596	4640177	I fucking hate that I went there.
4640597	4641177	But you know what?
4641237	4649521	That's literally what these gaming companies try to sell you sometimes to get a little more money out of your pocket is that they sell you concepts of a plan and then it never materializes.
4650182	4652463	So I'm glad Steam says, you know what?
4652823	4658266	If you don't produce, then the money goes back to them and it comes out of your check.
4658786	4659006	Good.
4660430	4664172	If a publisher intends to deliver on what they're promising, there's nothing to worry about.
4664492	4664572	Yeah.
4684617	4688740	SS2100 Matt says, too many devs treat season passes as down payments.
4689100	4692383	And if that down payment doesn't pay for the DLC, then they won't do it.
4692483	4693123	Just sucks.
4693383	4694344	So good guy, Steam.
4694444	4694784	I agree.
4695525	4699668	You know, and again, I know people are going to say, but the cost of making video games is so expensive.
4700028	4701969	No one forced you to make that DLC.
4702170	4703451	Like, honestly, like I get it.
4703471	4704271	Three words.
4704611	4705272	Three words.
4705792	4707013	Baldur's Gate 3.
4707053	4707533	Mm-hmm.
4712574	4713635	That's all I have to say.
4714496	4723502	If your company is reliant on that DLC prepayment in order to function, then I don't think you have a good business model.
4723542	4736152	DLC is supposed to be, okay, we ship the game, the game is done, hey, the game's getting a lot of support, let's put some more content their way, and you start up that whole process.
4736552	4742057	Not only should it be cheaper to develop, because you've already developed the base game, you're just adding content at that point,
4742597	4748004	But, like, it shouldn't be that, oh, well, we can't finish this game if we don't sell this DLC.
4748124	4750748	Like, then what are you doing?
4753911	4762116	All right, well, moving on, let's talk about, before we get to our classic game of the week, let's talk about kind of a larger phenomenon outside of gaming.
4762316	4770461	And I've made it no secret here on this program that I have fucking hated X, and specifically the owner of that platform, Elon Musk, for quite some time.
4771101	4776284	Ever since he started his anti-trans bullshit, I said, you know what, this is not a place I want to support anymore.
4776584	4778025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4795461	4796421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4823248	4837267	Mastodon also an alternative Threads also an alternative but I think a reason why Blue Sky is sticking is because it feels like what Twitter felt like in 2015 probably because do you know where Blue Sky came from?
4838949	4839730	Twitter in 2015
4842887	4858759	It's it was and that's where the controversy of Jack being involved was because technically it was a spinoff from Twitter when Jack was involved and he is no longer involved, by the way, as a big public breakup, because Jack is actually
4859219	4859539	DarkSakura,
4877091	4877952	XBOX.COM XBOX.COM XBOX.COM
4897791	4909728	Capcom has a variety of accounts there most of the big AAA gaming studios and the indie developers are starting to show up on Blue Sky but the question is without an algorithm
4910828	4913749	How are people going to get their things noticed on Blue Sky?
4913789	4919031	Because again, and this is one reason people like Blue Sky, there is no algorithm to carry you.
4919391	4929755	There are custom algorithms and there's other ways with reblogging and stuff and different types of custom feeds to get noticed, but it's going to be a very different ballgame over on Blue Sky.
4929775	4933036	Of course, Blue Sky has starter packs and things to that note.
4933516	4937378	I will say GameDeveloper.com, which is more of an industry sort of
4938018	4942140	Online Magazine, we'll say, really took a deep dive on this subject.
4942321	4948244	And this is a very long kind of look into, you know, why are developers going to blue sky?
4948944	4952727	And by their own words here, as at a glance, what happened here
4953487	4955709	Game developers are also leaving X for Blue Sky.
4956509	4960873	X was a critical hub for game developers to market games, network, and share creative ideas.
4961393	4966036	But folks hope that Blue Sky is going to recreate that experience, minus hate speech and Nazis.
4966497	4971701	Which is pretty much why all of us are re-rolling on Blue Sky right now, because we're sick of that shit.
4972221	4974403	And, you know, it goes for game developers as well.
4975083	4976584	Let me go a little deeper.
4976624	4981987	I want to read to you some things that game developers are actually saying on Blue Sky.
4982587	4992012	One developer, Andrew Eich, I hope I said that right, who goes by BuddingMonkey, said, "...I joined almost exactly one year ago, mostly to see what's going on in the early days.
4992513	4997936	It quickly evolved here from a place that felt like a refuge from Twitter to a full community with its own ethos."
4998496	5002499	Twitter has become exclusively vitrolic political dialogue.
5002559	5004961	It has no more space for complete humans.
5007122	5007723	I'm sorry.
5009204	5010185	I want to cross stitch.
5010405	5015789	You know those little cross stitches people make and hang in their bathrooms of these like great quotes and phrases?
5016309	5017230	That is too good.
5017971	5021393	Twitter has become exclusively vitrolic political dialogue.
5021493	5024676	It has no more space for complete humans.
5025276	5029097	That is such a good read.
5030118	5031558	Anyway, continuing on.
5032238	5036800	I miss having conversations with other developers about the craft of making games.
5037340	5039040	I miss learning from other developers.
5039561	5042782	I miss being able to talk directly to fans in a digestible format.
5043082	5046063	Blue Sky gives me hope that we can have a community again.
5048132	5054574	Going to another developer, Gwen Katz, who wrote some comments here on Blue Sky.
5055214	5066696	With the collapse of arts journalism, crowdfunding scaling drastically back, and most traditional publishers canning their promotional budgets, social media is essentially the only avenue remaining for creators to find an audience.
5067157	5070297	Twitter was once vastly the most successful platform for this.
5070957	5077079	But once Twitter stripped the blue checks from verified accounts, the handwriting was on the wall.
5077839	5079500	And there was need for an alternative.
5079680	5080500	Also a good read.
5081300	5084442	Several competitors failed to take off for various reasons.
5084502	5085882	Co-host Hive, Spoutable.
5085982	5086762	I never heard of Spoutable.
5087323	5090844	Blue Sky avoided those pitfalls and seems poised to fill the Twitter niche.
5091404	5099127	Blue Sky has proved to be an excellent tool for networking and building an audience thanks to starter packs, feeds, and not penalizing links and images.
5099587	5103469	Whether it works well for actual conversation remains to be seen, though.
5103849	5117499	So anyway, I do want to, you know, just kind of point you to this game developer article that goes, you know, really deeply in it, but it's basically a lot of people kind of, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like the voices of game developers kind of validating why the rest of us jump ship.
5117899	5119140	We are tired of...
5120678	5124900	Non-complete human voices being elevated on the other platform.
5125540	5127100	And it is refreshing on Blue Sky.
5127660	5129121	And Blue Sky is not a perfect platform.
5129361	5132202	As it is exponentially growing, it is going to have growing pains.
5132522	5134223	It is going to have moderation problems.
5134243	5136103	There are going to be things that come up.
5136624	5144386	But again, you have to look at who do you trust more right now to fore edge your social media platform?
5144806	5146187	Do you trust Elon Musk?
5146207	5146467	No.
5148331	5150493	Or do you trust Jay and the Blue Sky team?
5151093	5158039	Which, while it hasn't always been perfect, I feel like she is, for the most part, making better calls.
5158519	5168547	I trust that Blue Sky's... I feel like a platform that's actually trying to listen, as opposed to, well, I've decided we don't need blocking anymore, so we're just getting rid of it.
5170428	5172070	That's a key difference between the two platforms.
5173311	5173551	Anyway...
5174586	5177427	E3VL was asking in chat, what is a starter pack?
5177787	5185009	A starter pack is basically, think of it as a glorified form of a list, a list of accounts that you can follow with one touch of a button.
5185409	5191891	So it's like, oh, you're getting this pack and Bobby actually linked to, we actually have a VOG Network starter pack.
5192031	5194811	So at vognetwork.com has a starter pack.
5194871	5196992	And if you follow that starter pack, you will get
5197492	5206936	Bog Network, me, Loki, Jamie, Bobby, Anime Jam Session, their hosts, British... I don't think British Invaders is on Blue Sky yet, but probably before too long.
5207777	5214820	You know, and some of our longest and most vocal supporters whose voices have crafted these shows over the years.
5214860	5218862	You know, people like SSJ100Matt, Deft, you know, people that are like, you know...
5219975	5222556	They have a voice around here, even if not formally on a show.
5222916	5224036	Travis Donovan's on there, too.
5224797	5230498	People that used to have a show, PodCulture, I believe, is on that pack, too, are also there.
5230598	5232819	So you can follow all of us with just one touch of a button.
5233499	5235880	For me, that's a lot of people.
5237721	5238481	Oh, sorry, Bobby.
5238701	5243603	I guess there are some footnotes as to why maybe not everybody is in the pack.
5243663	5243923	My bad.
5247038	5276156	but I think it's a lot but I like the idea of the different tabs the different custom feeds because like being able to put all that side by side and by the way if you were pissed that Elon Musk got rid of TweetDeck guess what go to the website deck.blue it's literally TweetDeck for blue sky it's great for those of you that like to have four or five feeds on display at once it's a great application deck.blue great anyway
5277335	5282916	Alright, so that's a little bit about the real world and how it is affecting game developers as well.
5283176	5291598	You know, being able to access your favorite game developers used to be a great thing and then it turned into a cesspool and maybe it can be a great thing again.
5291758	5292178	We'll see.
5292978	5301440	Anyway, let's travel back to a simpler time when if you wanted to contact your favorite game developer, you had to write a letter and put it in the mail.
5302580	5305161	Let's go back to the classic game of the week with this bumper.
5315891	5323186	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5323667	5326192	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5327916	5333358	Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week this week?
5334478	5356085	In the spirit of Thanksgiving and hunting turkeys and mayhem and shenanigans I chose South Park for Nintendo 64 It was not a good game It was not on my bingo card of games DarkSakura would pick
5357532	5360134	I was like, what has turkeys in it and is really annoying?
5360274	5361614	Oh yeah, that game exists.
5361835	5362395	Alright, fair.
5363896	5378004	So anyway, it is a first-person shooter game based on South Park, developed by Iguana Entertainment using a modified version of the engine that was used in Turok 2 Seeds of Evil.
5378524	5379885	I mean, they're the same publisher, so whatever.
5380766	5403509	um it was released for Nintendo 64 in 1998 and for Windows in 1999 in uh Europe and uh it came out later PlayStation port came out later too developed by Appaloosa Interactive and it was that last release was meant to coincide with South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut the movie
5404583	5420123	it was the Nintendo 64 version was not well liked I'm just going to throw that out there PC and Playstation versions were received quite a bit better but there were other games that came out and they were kind of received the same way
5420763	5425864	So anyway, you play one of the four boys, Cartman, Kyle, Stan, or Kenny.
5426924	5430565	And you have to defeat enemies with different weapons that you find.
5430585	5432566	You start off with snowballs, I think, yeah.
5433326	5442128	And after you complete your levels, you have to fight against large enemies with a tank.
5443368	5452738	And then if you don't win, then you have to defend South Park from other tanks in a minigame called Penalty Round.
5453595	5455957	There is a multiplayer head-to-head mode.
5457038	5459420	So there's some people who found value in that.
5459720	5469108	But with the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 version, when you reach select stages in player mode, you get a code for it.
5469589	5475453	And then you can put those into Cheesy Poof's decoder and get additional characters for head-to-head play.
5475954	5476594	So that's neat.
5478756	5483899	Eventually, yeah, on the Nintendo 64 version, you can choose between 20 characters and 17 multiplayer levels.
5484339	5489602	But on the PlayStation, only two players can play and are limited to six multiplayer levels and 20 characters.
5490942	5500107	The Windows version gives you four new levels titled Mustard Block, Sartendipity, oh, got it, Tabindance, and Soman Go.
5501208	5501788	So, uh...
5502506	5506630	You also have four extra characters you can play, which is Shelly, Satan, Jesus, and Santa.
5507551	5508152	So there you go.
5510494	5515019	So the story of the game is that this comet is approaching the Earth, and...
5516545	5536893	It is basically concentrated evil, and the closer it gets, the more South Park is attacked, including rabid mutant turkeys, weird clones of the townspeople, aliens, crazy robots, sentient killer toys.
5537953	5541474	And it is up to Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.
5542855	5543015	And...
5544164	5552446	Yeah, that's for them to investigate and save everything, thanks to a warning by Chef who got the fuck out of Dodge.
5553126	5557947	So, it really overall just was not well received.
5560928	5569810	For all game, the PlayStation version got two stars, the N64 version got two and a half stars, and the PC version got four stars.
5570550	5571630	Sorry, three and a half, my bad.
5575161	5580343	They're basically saying that it starts off kind of funny and then gets really repetitive and that's about it.
5583965	5589167	GameSpot was saying that it's proof that a good license and good graphics aren't enough to sell a game.
5590147	5593488	But the voice acting, it was done by the original voice actors.
5596789	5598610	There were just so many complaints about it.
5600071	5600591	But I mean...
5602449	5615862	IGN said it was just as funny as watching the show, and GameSpot said that the Nintendo 64 version doesn't have very good level design, but it makes sense with the license.
5616142	5616983	So, yeah.
5617304	5618925	I mean, it was commercially successful.
5620106	5625832	By June 1999, the N64 version shipped nearly 1 million units worldwide.
5626332	5632018	and by October 1999 it has sold well over 1 million units.
5632258	5634080	The first one was nearly 1 million units.
5634700	5636882	So there were sequels that were cancelled.
5637923	5640546	There was one that was tentatively called South Park 2.
5641567	5647672	It was announced when they released the first game with a 2000 release date but it was cancelled.
5648593	5658659	and so they focused on cheaper and simpler releases including South Park Chef's Love Shack in 1999 and South Park Rally in 2000.
5659620	5668225	There was another follow-up kind of a sandbox adventure game that was in development for PS2, GameCube and Xbox but it was unfinished and unreleased.
5670366	5683276	they really didn't know anything about it until a build of it was found on an Xbox dev kit no playable version out as far as I know but there's footage out there so you can watch that if you're interested but yeah
5684899	5685999	Mutant Turkeys.
5686780	5687801	Go throw snowballs at them.
5688261	5688861	Save your town.
5690022	5690643	Happy Turkey Day.
5690783	5693525	Enjoy the extremely mediocre draw distance.
5695126	5695526	Right?
5697127	5700369	I think this was N64 before the RAM cart.
5700429	5702311	For its time, this was amazing.
5702371	5702431	Ish.
5702451	5702911	It was alright.
5702931	5703071	I think
5713382	5717924	I think I had been somewhere where this was being played and it kind of bored me.
5718564	5723867	But the evil turkeys are hilarious and so I figured that was apropos of the season.
5724287	5733111	It is a very timely pick and not just because a classic game of the week is denoted as a classic game of the week doesn't mean we're endorsing it as a good game.
5733751	5737293	Sometimes games are classic because of how bad they were.
5737793	5742235	It had a notable impact because it was wasn't this the first South Park game?
5742375	5771261	I think it was and you know again in the late 90s South Park was huge it's kind of it's strange to me that it's still going it's like the Simpsons I barely hear about it anymore unless like you know Milhouse's voice actress retires or something like that but like otherwise I'm always shocked they're still going because they don't feel like they have that same cultural impact they had in the 90s you know I think the last episode I actually watched was the DDR one oh god I watched the World of Warcraft one yeah
5772219	5800260	but the one I always remember most is Chinpokomon for me it was Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride which again that one was great and for it's you know with as much as you know some people point out how South Park is problematic whatever I will say that that particular episode was actually hugely ahead of its time for how LGBT you know issues were being portrayed on TV at the time so you know it's just interesting so
5801689	5803311	I found something I'm kind of interested in.
5803491	5803852	What's that?
5804412	5808537	There's a new Mado Monogatari game coming out in Japan.
5812442	5813824	It's the series that spawned P.O.P.O.
5815362	5815582	Nice.
5816443	5817743	And a new Snow Brothers game.
5818284	5818444	Cool.
5818464	5821765	S2100 Matt in chat says, I remember loving this game as a kid more than it deserved.
5822125	5826368	While it was funny, it was tough to complete the tasks on stages because it was so easy to get lost.
5826688	5828289	The cheats for this were funny.
5828489	5830190	And he links us to a cheats page.
5830590	5832711	Remember when video games had cheats and not DLC?
5834269	5835049	There's still cheats.
5835429	5835730	There are.
5835850	5838811	They just find out about them 10 years later.
5839611	5844052	Maybe the Game Awards will nominate a cheat as a Game of the Year some year.
5844212	5849514	Or maybe the Game Awards will nominate the cheat from a Homestar Runner video game someday.
5849654	5851455	The cheat.
5851475	5852155	There was one.
5852195	5852795	I remember one.
5852855	5854136	Telltale did one some time back.
5855436	5859057	There was also the card game.
5859558	5860358	Yes, yes.
5861636	5861876	All right.
5861996	5862757	Oh, there's a danger.
5862917	5864019	There's a dangerous game.
5866041	5866341	All right.
5866361	5872007	Well, let's travel around and check out some other news from the gaming world in rapid fire news.
5872228	5872508	Loki.
5874030	5874330	Yes.
5874690	5880377	So we're going to be getting a new Horizons and Zero Dawn Lego set.
5882318	5886199	So I actually have the first one, the Tall Neck set, which was released a while back.
5886239	5902965	As part of, I want to say it was a LEGO Idea set, but now with LEGO Horizon Adventures out, there is the new Shell Walker and also, oh yeah, it's Alloy and Barl versus Shell Walker and Sawtooth.
5903745	5907726	It's going to cost $45 for an 800-piece set.
5907966	5909167	It's going to be coming out March 1st.
5910558	5910919	It's all right.
5911019	5911780	I don't have room for it.
5912200	5918609	I didn't realize how fucking huge like this whole artisan Lego thing was getting until I went to Target yesterday.
5918669	5921893	And you know, they have all the Legos and lock boxes there.
5922374	5924336	But like half of the aisle... Oh, weird.
5924376	5925358	Not all of them are like that, yeah.
5925598	5925918	DarkSakura.com
5944171	5948013	For the podcast people, Loki just held it up on the camera that he built that.
5948113	5952615	But yeah, it's all of us who grew up on Lego that are now like in our 40s.
5952715	5956156	Like, I have anxiety and I need something to calm my brain.
5956516	5960618	And so it's like, here, why don't you build a cat out of over a thousand Legos?
5962182	5979662	Yeah, the flowers are very popular as well, and they have so many sets of those, and they've even expanded out now to... I see it now where they have, like, Disney-inspired flower sets that also have, like, kind of a, you know, going a little bit old school here, Polly Pocket-style, like, fold-open, like...
5981264	5981484	and so on.
6000451	6027125	it's essentially like I saw one that they had it was like the old like night set someone's done like you know of course also the Lego ideas stuff is a big program and you basically go design sets they have free apps you can get out there to just build stuff with virtual Legos and then you create that set or what up on the website if it gets 10,000 votes they consider it you know as possibly something they release so it's pretty crazy
6027645	6028585	Yeah.
6028625	6034427	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the flowers got big in 2020 when everyone was home and adults were buying Lego for something to do.
6034547	6040808	Yeah, if I recall correctly, Mrs. Blackwolf has a few of those sets set up around y'all's house.
6040888	6041908	I remember from being there.
6042369	6043789	Yeah, I'm not knocking it.
6043889	6044629	I'm just surprised.
6044749	6047510	I was a little taken aback at how big it's gotten.
6047570	6053351	I was like, oh, I didn't realize we have an entire aisle at Target dedicated to this now.
6053731	6056352	But even I was going, well, should we buy the cat?
6056372	6056532	Yeah.
6057557	6076515	but then I realized I have a it's not Lego but it's a knockoff brand whoever has the Pokemon license because it's not Lego I have a squirtle that I bought at Target ironically enough waiting to be constructed in the other room and until I build that no more Legos so
6077116	6092165	Yeah, and they've got, like, I mean, every time I go there now, they have the Super Mario World Mario Riding Yoshi set that you can animate with a crank that keeps calling my name, and I'm like, eh.
6092265	6101550	And then also, like, the Minecraft crafting table set, which it's the, like, micro versions of it, and I really don't like those.
6103331	6105312	But yeah, I look at it and I'm like, eh.
6107133	6107834	If I had the room.
6108856	6109617	Fair enough, fair enough.
6110439	6112061	Alright, well, let's move on.
6112081	6112983	We have more headlines, right?
6114645	6121989	Yeah, and then along with that, of course, we're going to be getting some more announcements out of Announcement Fest.
6122210	6125231	I'm sorry, Game Awards pretty soon here.
6126112	6132516	Basically that the developers behind Black Myth Wukong are going to have some announcements to make.
6132896	6133956	What are those announcements?
6134477	6135217	Who knows?
6136258	6137819	But it's going to be exciting.
6138139	6141061	Potential DLC and ports to the Xbox.
6141341	6142521	I guess we'll find out.
6142962	6143242	Maybe.
6146638	6147518	Alright, DarkSakura.
6148639	6152821	Well, one of my least favorite fighting game series is going to be coming out for PC.
6153321	6155882	I know a lot of people love it, so it's absolutely worth mentioning.
6155942	6161825	Virtua Fighter 5 Revo, R-E-V-O is going to be coming out for Steam.
6162125	6165727	It's based off of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown that came out on PS4.
6165927	6173191	It has a rollback netcode, 4K graphics, 60 frames per second, game balance adjustments, and
6173551	6180733	and it will come out at the same time as a version 2.0 game balance for Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown.
6182054	6182374	All right.
6183354	6188115	And in other player versus player games, Overwatch has a brand new hero that's been announced.
6188455	6190756	It's a new tank character named Hazard.
6191236	6196018	Hazard is a Scottish fellow who's very large and he kind of looks punk rock.
6196318	6200279	Apparently originally conceived as a cyberpunk villain named Spiker.
6200899	6203160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6226755	6230418	I was surprised when they said there was like 40-some heroes, and I'm like, holy cow.
6230438	6231239	Yeah, there's quite a few.
6232119	6236243	If you want to check them out, the trial is running right now, except it actually ends tomorrow.
6236383	6246071	So those of you listening on the podcast may have missed the trial, but he will be added to the roster permanently in Overwatch 2 Season 14.
6247152	6251696	Keep in mind, each one of those seasons had a new character, Loki, and that starts on December 10th.
6254056	6254356	All right.
6254856	6266702	Well, let's talk about some things coming a little sooner than that Overwatch season in world release dates, which again, with the holiday in the US, I don't think we have a lot, but let's travel the world.
6266762	6268483	Let's see, Loki, what's coming out in the US this week.
6269572	6270333	We have a few things.

6298392	6305814	We've got MXGP24, the official game, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6306274	6310455	It feels like the official game part of that probably is unnecessary.
6311535	6328125	Raven's Watch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Riki 8-bit game collection on Nintendo Switch Riviera, the Promised Land remaster on Nintendo Switch
6329265	6342101	and Snow Brothers Wonderland on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and last but not least Tokyo Psychodemic on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5

6541785	6546668	We'll also take some calls, potentially, over at our Discord server, vognetwork.com.
6547128	6551611	And we will get to any emails you may have sent at participate at orangelaundradio.com.
6552152	6553292	We still have some stories for you.
6553473	6553713	Loki.
6555168	6555629	Thank God.
6569744	6577387	Yeah, so they've got, you know, basically a checkbox that says, Please disclose that this project contains content produced by gender of AI tools.
6578088	6579668	And then you check yes or no.
6579768	6582149	And then what kind of gender of AI is used?
6582590	6585051	Graphics, sound, text, dialogue, code, etc.
6585911	6592094	And then along with that says they're going to allow... Also, there's going to be a...
6594381	6602464	No AI tag applied to those who specifically mark their content as being human-made.
6602744	6605065	So you'll be able to filter by that.
6606325	6613368	And they also said that the company is... They're trying to...
6615362	6619865	essentially trying to block, I think, some of the scraping of that data as well.
6620006	6630333	But yeah, they're also, oh, I'm sorry, they're de-indexing those creators who do not mark or comply with that as well.
6630413	6632435	So they're going to be taking them off of their search.
6632455	6635197	So have you certified Pixel Poops 2 as AI-free?
6637939	6638379	Not yet.
6638399	6639921	I'll have to go do that.
6641502	6642983	There is no AI poop in this game.
6644181	6645242	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6666258	6672564	Well, apparently we are going to be seeing an actual Minecraft theme park coming out.
6672684	6673504	Actually, two of them.
6673885	6674365	Two of them.
6674385	6676827	Yeah, it's going to be one in the US and one in the UK.
6677328	6690179	Sometime between 2026 and 2027, Merlin Entertainment will be the ones creating these Minecraft parks that will boast interactive attractions such as, you know, and things like rides and
6690499	6703705	gift shops, of course there's going to be gift shops, restaurants, I don't know what you would eat at the Minecraft Cafe, but cool, and then apparently plans to possibly extend this even further than just these two locations across the globe at some point.
6704085	6714690	They're also talking about digital perks, but apparently the, you know, we don't have a lot of details, but it would be touch points that allow guests to unlock exclusive in-game content
6715050	6716731	to continue their gaming journey.
6717151	6719912	Well, maybe if Minecraft World, what was it called?
6719932	6720573	Minecraft Realms?
6721053	6724114	That AR game that they came and went.
6724374	6726795	Oh yeah, the Minecraft Villager Rescue thing.
6726875	6728336	Yeah, it's basically capes.
6728776	6730477	They'll unlock capes or something.
6731117	6731758	Or it'll be...
6733513	6756305	DLC for bedrock like you know add on like costume things that they do they do that a lot like cereal and crackers and whatever else they throw minecraft stuff in now if you haven't heard of Merlin they actually this is not coming out of nowhere they are known theme park builders you may have heard of a place called Legoland which is very ironic I am also a known theme park builder
6759366	6782501	Merlin Entertainment is behind Legoland they also have throughout Europe they have the Gardaland Resort in Italy, Chessington World of Adventures in the UK, Hyde Park in Germany so they're actually the second biggest theme park builder behind Disney and I would have thought that was Universal but I guess not so Merlin is actually the second biggest there so Loki?
6783662	6784162	Thoughts?
6785768	6789933	I mean, it's so early, because these are not coming out for another couple years, but...
6790950	6818022	I'm excited to see what they do I think it's kind of funny that these are the people that make Legoland But for that reason, I don't think this is in Southern California They're not going to put this next to Legoland It's going to be in Dallas or something like that It'll be like something ridiculous I would love to see it in Silicon Valley But the land there is too fucking expensive In fact, that's why Great America is going to be going away We're only going to have one theme park in Northern California If you can believe it, for all the people who live here
6819045	6820665	I mean, I don't know.
6820705	6822126	There's a lot of open land.
6823206	6823626	Florida.
6824086	6825086	You should put it in Florida.
6825866	6826806	They'll put it in Florida.
6826866	6829867	But like, you know, we can.
6830627	6834768	Have they done anything with the real world yards yet in Sacramento?
6834788	6840229	Supposedly a soccer stadium is going to be the thing they're going to make there.
6840249	6842449	We got a bunch of like hills and stuff out here.
6842529	6845570	So like, you know, I'm sure they can throw something out there.
6845650	6846590	Yeah, I just don't know.
6846790	6846950	Yeah.
6847915	6861064	E3VL in chat says Great America is going away yeah that came out that news came out about a year ago but it's really weird because it's like they've sold the land that it sits it's going to become condos basically but
6862054	6891324	I guess for what they still will operate Great America through like 2026 I think but it's so weird that it's like you have a lame duck theme park at this point which is wild to me I guess it's time to go before it's gone I don't think they've added anything new to it I have to look I have never ridden a ride there except the Marvel 4D thing and played a lot of Planet Harriers
6892093	6893454	That's fascinating.
6893594	6895255	That was in my no rollercoaster era.
6895375	6898676	They still have the Mass Effect ride.
6899877	6900717	I need to go on that.
6900897	6903999	They're not replacing things because they know the park is gone.
6904019	6905359	So the Mass Effect ride is still there.
6906240	6907520	I need to do that before it's gone then.
6907540	6908081	Yeah, you really should.
6908381	6909741	Okay, actually, here's the deal.
6909842	6916425	Okay, Santa Clara sold the land to Cedar Fair, who sold it to Prologis.
6917365	6920126	Six Flags will eventually close the park by 2033.
6922527	6930651	So the land rental agreement is a six-year lease through 2028 that will give ProLogis the option of extending it another five years.
6931191	6936814	That is so weird to me, but okay.
6936974	6938595	And then I'm trying to see like what
6939511	6941132	Other things they have added.
6941472	6944553	Is there a way to see like what year they've added things?
6944613	6947455	I'm looking at the Wiki article to try to see.
6948355	6949616	What did they close recently?
6950626	6951948	They haven't closed a ride since 2017.
6952588	6953629	That's it.
6953669	6956392	Did you know they closed Logger's Run and The Endeavor?
6957013	6959356	Oh, one of those rides I said I would never fucking ride.
6959396	6959936	The Endeavor.
6960237	6962659	That's the ship that would spin a complete 360.
6963300	6963821	That's gone.
6964181	6964962	That was the last ride.
6965002	6965403	Oh, yeah.
6965543	6966784	That was the last ride they closed.
6966844	6967545	I didn't realize that.
6967585	6970668	I've had zero interest in one of those since my sister threw up on one.
6970769	6970869	Ugh.
6971906	6972386	Gross, gross, gross.
6972646	6974186	Yeah, Mass Effect New Earth is still there.
6975247	6975987	All right, we're going.
6977067	6980868	I would go back for fun, but yeah.
6981328	6983328	I'm trying to figure out what the most recent ride is that they opened.
6983748	6989529	In 2022, the park introduced Liberty Twirler, a new scrambler ride.
6990009	6992970	A new show, The Corner Notes, was also introduced.
6993810	6995270	So a scrambler ride.
6995450	6997631	Is that like what you see at the state fair, the scrambler?
6997871	6998691	That must be what that is.
6999919	7001980	Yeah, I think it's one of the ones that just spins around.
7002761	7003321	I'd go on that.
7004182	7007184	I liked the Survivor ride, but it's no longer the Survivor ride.
7007244	7009125	It's Tiki Twirl, because all the Paramount stuff's gone.
7009145	7010125	It's Tiki Twirl.
7010426	7019071	And then the Top Gun ride is Flight Deck, and everything that used to be something is just... I won't go on anything made out of wood.
7019984	7029801	I don't remember the code, but yeah, because my drop tower is based off of the Great America one, and same with part of the entrance to the park is sort of based off of that as well.
7030322	7033728	So yeah, I did a lot of research when I came to look at that stuff.
7033953	7034834	Elis went to see Margaret Cho
7054210	7055452	Oh my god, I was there.
7055512	7058355	That was a pride night in like our 20s.
7058876	7061519	Jesus Christ, that was a long time ago.
7061680	7062621	And Jessica was there?
7063282	7064824	Oh, this was, that means-
7069429	7096683	this was before OLR because okay yeah then that was okay because that she did her CD I sang like a prayer in the karaoke booth and Travis Donovan would play that CD every fucking year for the rest of my life he's probably playing it now somewhere it's a song constant repeat making fun of it it's it's his uh his uh gray noise machine it's what he falls asleep to every night yeah
7099775	7100455	But no, we have to go.
7101156	7102896	It'd be fun to go.
7103316	7105617	The last time I went was for that Mass Effect ride.
7105657	7108859	There's actually a video of Shane and I. I think it's on the VOG Network.
7108919	7110680	And Shane never lets himself be on video.
7110700	7116342	But I said, if we do this, you are going to film a video with me on this Mass Effect ride.
7117622	7119503	And I think that was the last time I was there.
7119563	7121224	It's on the VOG Network YouTube somewhere.
7121764	7122825	Us reviewing the ride.
7123505	7123685	Yeah.
7125718	7128862	Ranma says Travis has played that CD on his show.
7129042	7130264	Oh, I'm well aware.
7131085	7134509	You make it sound like he played it one time and that would be a lie.
7134910	7138895	He has played it multiple times on his show.
7141212	7143715	Oh, this news maybe, since we're talking about theme parks.
7143875	7146537	All right, we're in the listener roundtable now because we've clearly gotten off track.
7148099	7149240	There's no emails, by the way.
7149460	7151682	Okay, participate at orangeauntradio.com.
7151702	7152303	Try again next week.
7152323	7154565	S2100Matt says, they're getting rid of Muppets 3D.
7159289	7162072	and Muppet Land at Disney Hollywood Studios.
7162492	7163773	And they're putting in Monsters, Inc.
7163813	7164334	Land instead.
7164754	7167797	That does make me very sad because I liked Muppet Vision.
7167877	7168978	It was cheesy as fuck.
7169298	7171000	They got rid of it at California Great Adventure, too.
7171040	7172221	They got rid of it a long time ago.
7173482	7174003	I don't know what.
7174043	7174943	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
7175003	7177906	That sounds like a Disney World thing, not a Disney.
7177966	7178347	It is.
7178507	7178827	It is.
7178907	7183591	So it was still at Disney World after it was gone from California Venture.
7184432	7194919	it's now leaving Disney World as well so it won't be anywhere bring back Captain EO what did they even do in the Captain EO theater now?
7196260	7209689	they brought back Honey I Shrunk the Audience for a little bit for like a month which is not good, I'm sorry well yeah, but for me it was just being a little bit giggly seeing Eric Idle and Rick Moranis yeah, yeah um
7211034	7215338	I know the one in California Adventure would do movie previews.
7215738	7220522	They did a pretty badass Tron preview thing, but that was when Electronica was there.
7220542	7222704	They need to give us the Tron fucking ride.
7223725	7224826	Where the fuck would they build it?
7224846	7225186	Give it.
7225306	7226047	Where would they build it?
7226427	7227268	There's no place to put it.
7229208	7245159	that's the problem with California there's no like every time they talk about expanding Disneyland they are going to have to bulldoze a hotel to do it basically so there is talk that they just take out the little theater and the Monsters Inc right there and make it a
7246420	7263642	uh under partly underground and partly above ground and there is talk that Disney's gonna expand um I think they're gonna tear down Mickey and Friends and build the parking structure further away and they want to build another space in Mickey and Friends I don't know it's something wild I mean
7264563	7269186	They tore down the whole parking lot to give us California Adventure and Downtown Disney.
7269206	7270007	It's a playbook that works.
7270027	7280654	But yeah, if you've only been to Disney World and never Disneyland, you need to understand Disneyland is in the middle of what us and NorCal would just simply call LA.
7282155	7282996	It's Anaheim.
7283136	7289980	It is surrounded by some kind of businesses, like older businesses.
7290000	7290661	Development.
7290821	7291962	And a neighborhood.
7292662	7293483	And neighborhoods.
7294321	7294901	Yeah.
7295382	7299803	Which is why there's those big tubes on Incredicoaster.
7300224	7306787	Yeah, so there's no place for them to put new stuff without tearing down something old.
7307167	7309928	It'll just start becoming like a triple-decker amusement park.
7310188	7311769	You know, the park of the future.
7311789	7312149	Yeah.
7313534	7316816	I told you that they replaced the whole innovations place with a restaurant.
7317436	7318537	Oh, did they finally replace it?
7318557	7319117	I didn't know that.
7320058	7320678	A couple years ago.
7320978	7325261	I will say though, this is important too for Florida, the people that have only ever done Disney World.
7325621	7333445	The advantage of Disneyland is that because there's no more space and everything is right there, everything is right there.
7333685	7339689	And if you get a park hopper, you literally walk from one park to the other like you're crossing the street.
7339869	7340429	It's easy.
7340609	7341390	We're good in souls.
7341470	7346794	Florida's not... Florida, you gotta move around by shuttle or something.
7347234	7348555	And plus, it's Florida.
7348695	7349716	Yeah, and it's Florida.
7350877	7352378	Okay, anyway.
7352698	7356641	Full disclaimer, I've never been to Disney World in Florida.
7356761	7358482	I've only been to Disney Springs.
7358602	7361264	And that was just last year because our cruise was out of Orlando.
7361725	7364006	And I thought I would get to go this year.
7364847	7366168	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7389147	7416615	now here's the I didn't read the second half of what SGO and Hunter Matt said about the Muppets thing because I actually think this part is pretty cool so there is a ride that we don't have it in California I've never been on it it's called Rockin' Roller Coaster featuring Aerosmith is the ride I think it's an indoor roller coaster I think they got rid of the Aerosmith one a while ago though yeah it is no so Aerosmith I thought the Aerosmith one didn't it replace like the old Hollywood dark ride or am I wrong
7418051	7419452	No, I think that was the ride.
7419472	7419732	I don't know.
7419752	7420813	I think they built it as Aerosmith.
7420853	7421373	I really do.
7421933	7422534	I don't know.
7422574	7423514	I don't know the history of Disney.
7423554	7428017	I might be thinking of two different ones, but I know that the Hollywood ride was crap.
7428217	7428537	But...
7429076	7433279	The, the, the part of the other reason why Aerosmith is going away.
7433359	7439123	I mean, the band is kind of retired, but the Muppets are going to be the new, so it's going to be an electric, what do they call the band?
7439223	7440664	The electric, electric mayhem.
7440784	7444186	It's going to be an, it's going to be rock and roller coaster with electric mayhem now.
7444426	7444686	Yes.
7444966	7446628	So that is actually kind of badass.
7446728	7449830	Like I, I just, I want to ride with Janice.
7449990	7453652	Janice is the most underrated Muppet on the entire fucking series.
7453852	7457675	And I feel like an electric mayhem ride is going to like feature Janice.
7458903	7477162	yeah so it was it was uh rockin roller coaster uh with Aerosmith and then they re in 2019 they changed it to Avengers Assemble Flight Force and now it's a new thing now okay Muppet Vision 3D yeah
7480094	7502988	Bobby Blackwell says the Hollywood Dark Ride was replaced recently it's not the same as Rockin' Roller Coaster okay when I think when I hear Hollywood Dark Ride I hear of what I think most people agree is the absolute worst ride Disney has ever done in their mere existence and that was Superstar Limo at California's Great Adventure that was what I was thinking of but I thought that they had a version of
7503996	7506158	Wait, wait, no, they didn't do that at California Adventure, did they?
7506778	7507479	No, yeah, Superstar Limo.
7507499	7508219	I thought they did that.
7508519	7512302	Yeah, Superstar Limo was there from opening day for like six months, and then it was gone.
7512342	7513503	It's the Monsters, the Monsters, Inc.
7513523	7515704	ride is what used to be Superstar Limo.
7515724	7515885	Oh, okay.
7515905	7517025	Yeah, so.
7517386	7519787	I don't think, I haven't been on that or the Monsters, Inc.
7519807	7520007	ride yet.
7520088	7520688	It was pretty awful.
7520848	7522429	That's why in the Monsters, Inc.
7522489	7524909	ride, there's the little TVs on the thing.
7525549	7527770	They had to reverse engineer a lot of Monsters, Inc.
7527870	7531951	into what that crap... Yeah, and you can find a ride of Superstar Limo on YouTube.
7532032	7532712	It's bad.
7533092	7535152	It's really bad.
7535172	7538333	Defunctland is a really good resource for a lot of that.
7538453	7539694	Yeah, I love watching them.
7540905	7546012	S200 Matt says that old Hollywood ride became the Mickey and Minnie Runaway Railroad.
7546553	7548375	Oh, they do have that ride at Disneyland.
7548436	7549036	It's really good.
7549197	7549858	I like that ride.
7549898	7550639	That was really good.
7552028	7557213	Yeah, that was like Rise of the Resistance for kids was what I got out of that ride.
7557653	7558954	I don't think I've been on that.
7559274	7559955	Oh, it's good.
7560155	7560876	The Mickey Minnie.
7561336	7564419	I think that's like Disney's newest ride in SoCal.
7565480	7570084	It's right near... I just stood in line for Rise of the Resistance several times in a row.
7570284	7572326	It's in Toontown.
7572426	7575869	I think they took out some of the stables that used to be behind Toontown.
7576289	7604191	and they built it it's right next to Roger Rabbit but like I think they okay they built it behind where it used to be backstage I didn't go to Toontown at all oh that's why that's a huge ride yeah but yeah I recommend it they I don't want to spoil it if you've never been on it but like the way the ride starts in the queue was really impressive I was like and I'm sure it's the same trick in Florida but I was like okay that was really well done like the way they do that so that's that's all I'll say about it
7605616	7608337	I think a good queue is the kind that makes people forget they're in queue.
7608537	7610097	And that's exactly what that ride did.
7613098	7613438	All right.
7613598	7618859	Anyway, well, we could talk theme park rides all night probably, but we don't have any emails, sadly.
7618999	7621520	Let me check in with Loki, though, to see if there's any last minute stories.
7624101	7624321	No.
7624841	7625201	No?
7625421	7627161	Well, it is a holiday week after all.
7628482	7633303	And on that note, I hope those of you that are celebrating Thanksgiving this week have a good one.
7634386	7662248	I hope you have safe journeys wherever you might be going and like for example I'm just doing Thanksgiving with my dad it's just going to be the three of us and that's fine we're doing cousin giving but one of my best gal pals and former co-host of the show called Shaking and Crying Here Miss Victoria or Aria Snark is going to be performing in Rocky Horror Picture Show Thanksgiving weekend so I'm going to go see it as if I haven't seen that movie enough times in my life but I'll see it one more time for Victoria
7662944	7666445	So Rob, my ballet studio is doing Time Warp.
7666785	7667386	Oh, that's fun.
7668386	7672267	I opted not to because I'm already doing a bunch of stuff.
7672347	7675028	That and the... I don't get to be Magenta.
7676389	7677349	I would have been mad too.
7677369	7679870	There's actually no one going to be in costume except for like two people.
7682511	7682831	All right.
7683516	7691663	Well, whatever you're doing for Thanksgiving, and even if you made a choice not to go be with family this year because you just can't handle it, that's fine.
7691784	7694706	Thanksgiving is whatever it looks like to you, mental health-wise.
7694866	7698389	I hope you have a mental wellness day.
7698510	7707838	I hope you have a mentally relaxing and uplifting day, however you choose to spend it, and a little break from your day job, that type of thing.
7708959	7711840	Thoughts and prayers to all of you Black Friday workers.
7712440	7716281	I don't know what else to offer in that situation except- I have something else to offer.
7716381	7717242	I will commit- If I may.
7717442	7719962	I will commit to not being an asshole on Black Friday.
7720303	7721343	Yes, DarkSakura.
7721823	7723304	I have an alternative to Black Friday.
7724264	7725324	I'm doing a sub-a-thon.
7725384	7725884	Yes, you are.
7725984	7726464	Yes, you are.
7727085	7732786	And rather than stay in line and buy the TV you don't need, you could just hang out with me.
7732806	7733367	There you go.
7733407	7734667	Friendsgiving, virtually.
7735627	7736988	And I'm going to put this down here-
7738891	7748893	I'm going to put this out here right now is that I have a special prize in the form of handwritten, sarcastic, and borderline rude holiday cards.
7749413	7749714	Rad.
7750074	7750954	What time are you starting?
7751994	7752254	10 a.m.
7752614	7752974	Okay, good.
7753014	7753374	I'm going to come.
7753394	7754375	Because I hate myself.
7754415	7755355	I'm going to come at the beginning.
7755655	7755935	Kidding.
7756935	7757155	All right.
7757175	7758316	Well, then that means you have to play.
7758336	7758976	I'm leaving here at 1.
7759336	7762477	Yes, I promised you a Himbo Chris, Dead by Daylight, and I plan to deliver.
7762497	7763277	I need a Himbo Chris.
7763677	7764017	All right.
7764177	7764397	All right.
7766092	7768414	Alright, well with that, we're going to wrap up tonight's show.

7785128	7789712	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show.
7790113	7792575	All of that goes an awful long way and we really appreciate it.
7794176	7796617	With that, we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
7797037	7800638	Speaking of streaming, I'm imagining DarkSakura's probably got some DVD in her tonight.
7801098	7804300	Yeah, it's going to be me and Smokey doing a 2v8 killer.
7804920	7805660	Oh, that'll be fun.
7805740	7806900	You going to keep working on your spirit?
7808461	7810842	Yeah, I've actually kind of enjoyed playing spirit.
7810882	7814203	I'm not really all that great, but I've gotten some spicy hits, and that made me happy.
7814703	7815203	Good, good.
7815883	7817644	All right, well, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
7821705	7822126	I don't know.
7822326	7822546	Just...
7823686	7824306	Don't be shitty.
7825147	7825507	That's all.
7826067	7826608	That's a good plan.
7826628	7827348	Be good.
7827548	7828189	Just be good.
7829869	7830150	Alright.
7830730	7832071	Have a good stream, DarkSakura.
7832791	7833291	Bye.
7834332	7835233	Loki, we'll go over to you.
7835273	7836073	Your final thought tonight.
7837154	7838554	I just have a lot of work to do this week.
7839195	7839795	You sure do.
7839875	7840215	And cook.
7841736	7848720	You gotta make that happen for what you're trying to do with your channel and all that good stuff, right?
7849701	7849881	Yep.
7851363	7852643	Alright, let's see.
7852703	7858666	My final thought is... I don't know.
7858686	7860306	I don't know if I have a lot.
7860606	7864688	I got to host another show last night and that's always a very lovely feeling.
7864848	7866268	I always love being able to do that.
7866368	7870390	So I look forward to being able to do more of that in the future.
7871510	7873591	That is what I'm going to say about that.
7874963	7875263	All right.
7876004	7882587	Well, we're going to wrap it up, except I just realized as I'm starting to wrap it up here, I was supposed to put in a new outro tonight that I forgot to do.
7882987	7884288	So I'm trying to do it right now.
7884788	7890351	So Loki, you could help me buy a little time here with a second final thought, if you might have anything.
7892027	7911257	uh yeah my second final thought I guess would be um yeah go watch my episode that I put out it's fun it's got plushies that I worked hard on and there's a lot of redstone in there so we're gonna probably thinking about um doing like a series a small series on like
7911897	7915820	Mini game design and stuff in Minecraft.
7915920	7918222	Just, you know, kind of what it takes to do that.
7918242	7920104	Because that's kind of what I'm doing next season anyways.
7920384	7921164	So it's not a mini game.
7921204	7922946	It's going to be like a massive game.
7923086	7925108	But same concept applies.
7925148	7929711	You just have to break down what you want to do and how to do it and all the components and everything.
7930472	7930692	All right.
7930712	7931613	Like game design, actually.
7932033	7932754	It is game design.
7932934	7933114	Nice.
7934380	7936801	Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
7936821	7938482	Thank you all so much for listening.
7938762	7947225	Have a wonderful week and we will see you in seven days to talk about whatever you might have bought for holiday sales and Cyber Monday and all that bullshit.
