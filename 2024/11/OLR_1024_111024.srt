1
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Marketing is a weird beast.

2
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Existing customers lose features in order to subsidize new customers.

3
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, a company needs growth, but where's the line?

4
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:22,435
[SPEAKER_04]: How often does a company try to lure new customers at the expense of their existing ones, making the problem worse on both fronts?

5
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:23,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Too often.

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,757
[SPEAKER_04]: The enshitification of GeForce Now starts in 2025, and it was already pretty niche.

7
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:29,857
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Service Graveyard Headline.

8
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:34,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

9
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now on the show, wherever your gamer has a voice...

10
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:42,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

11
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:45,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,228
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:54,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We're live once again with episode number 1024 for tonight.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, November 10th, 2024, so there's like a 10 and a 24 if you believe in that

15
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:01,713
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

16
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps they'll join us and chat a little later on tonight.

17
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:35,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're napping through the entire show tonight, then I don't blame her whatsoever.

18
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so she'll be out tonight.

19
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, we do have joining us this week.

20
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:42,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:43,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

22
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:44,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Loki.

23
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:44,484
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

24
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:45,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.

25
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting choice of the game playing behind you tonight.

26
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a little video game capture of Wolfenstein 3D.

27
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Wolfenstein 3D.

28
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,388
[SPEAKER_05]: What brought this game to mind?

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,864
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes you gotta kill some Nazis That's right, that's, yeah, always, always, alright So, yeah, this takes me, you know what's funny?

30
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:22,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about this game just a couple days ago And nothing, nothing to do, like, no jokes about the news or anything But I was at a, like, a gathering of gay gamers here locally with a friend of mine And, you know, we were looking around the game library And one of the games that I decided to play was Doom 2

31
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:46,825
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just caused this whole throwback conversation to like you know the 90s and how we used to play these like really simple because somebody in the room commented who had to have been like in their mid-20s was like you can't even jump in this game and it's like oh no you sweet summer child oh where would you where would you oh you mean in Doom 2 yeah Wolfenstein where would you jump you hit the ceiling

32
00:02:47,145 --> 00:03:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it was like one of those like yeah the games back then there wasn't like you know it was it was very simple and then that kind of went to talk about Wolfenstein 3D and it was like I remember the big thing that we used to do as the map editors back in the day right like I loved and I I know you being the Minecraft modding person that you are have built several Wolfenstein 3D maps in your day I'm sure oh yeah oh yeah of course do you ever build any do you

33
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:43,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not build any Doom maps I did Duke Nukem I did Duke Nukem maps with the build engine Wolfenstein I did build maps at least a couple maps one of the things that the neighbors used to like to do is make super violent mods I guess we just, hey let's put some more red pixels in there, you know that would be fun so we did that for a while

34
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:44,698
[SPEAKER_02]: That's neat.

35
00:03:45,058 --> 00:04:00,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the most famous like mod I remember for Wolfenstein was the Mortal Kombat one where it turned like the bosses into Mortal Kombat characters that would do, you know, when you, it was really gross deaths and everything when they got, you know, unalived and all that stuff.

36
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:02,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, good times, good times.

37
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:11,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or just hard maps with all of the, you know, spoiler Pac-Man characters because there's the Pac-Man ghosts that were, you can't kill them.

38
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

39
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Impossible to kill.

40
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's like Asshole Mario or those really hard Mario Maker levels, but in Wolfenstein.

41
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:20,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was fun.

42
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:28,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, you know, uh, making all of the movable walls, just like, just make them all over the place because that was fun.

43
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:28,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

44
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:32,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we need more open-ended creative games.

45
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,571
[SPEAKER_02]: The market's kind of softened on that a little bit.

46
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that sounds ridiculous talking to somebody who does a ton of Minecraft videos.

47
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:42,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking of things like we haven't had a Mario Maker or a little big planet.

48
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:45,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the story recently about the server shutting down.

49
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:45,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

50
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:51,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that casual level-making, sharing mode thing has kind of disappeared for a minute.

51
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's something I'm not thinking of, which is completely possible.

52
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:54,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

53
00:04:54,542 --> 00:05:19,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised people haven't I mean I'm sure someone's experimented with it somewhat but like I would think that the file formats for these older games especially like Wolfenstein 3 and stuff to create the levels uh would be something that like a AI or like a machine learning model would be able to kind of like at least figure out the format like to build the level for you like hey I want a level

54
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to make 10 levels for me or something like that and just see if it can create a map.

55
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:35,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily the whole route that we have with the AI Minecraft thing where it's not really Minecraft, it's just trained on images of Minecraft and so it's all...

56
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,013
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know, Trippy because it forgets everything.

57
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:54,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But like something you'd say, okay, you know, the map should have a start and an end and you should have enemies inside and they should have rooms and they should be connected by doors and basically set that up for you because I wouldn't think that would be that hard to like

58
00:05:55,456 --> 00:06:24,378
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be interesting you know obviously there's you know limits to the artistic use of AI that I can support but that could be interesting like something that starts building the level for you with like an AI prompt and then you can go in there and you know zhuzh it up around the edges and really make it what your vision of it is that could be very interesting that's the thing like with AI and a lot of like the design stuff like I could see

59
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:31,762
[SPEAKER_05]: that being used in game development but like say you wanted to

60
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to create an ancient city level or something like that.

61
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:41,102
[SPEAKER_05]: You could tell the AI, hey, this is what I'm looking to create.

62
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:47,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you gray box this for me and just create the kind of structure?

63
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the artists come in and go, okay, here's the structure of it.

64
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:55,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're going to actually make it look like something nice and just design that.

65
00:06:55,847 --> 00:07:00,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes even level design anywhere, because I'm going to have to deal with this next season.

66
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:02,430
[SPEAKER_05]: with designing a dungeon.

67
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Level design can be kind of hard, like, figuring out, like...

68
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:34,686
[SPEAKER_05]: what I want I want to have it be somewhat even but yet random and a maze I think you could train AI to I keep saying AI but machine learning you train a model to figure that out or at least assist in that that might be kind of helpful not necessarily like let's create the final product as some higher up execs want to do it's like no you can't talk to a hammer and say okay create me a cabinet

69
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm waiting.

70
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:38,318
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

71
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:47,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta have something where you can just speed up the process, but then let the artists actually take it and finish it.

72
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:48,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be...

73
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that, you know, everybody could be on board with making your job easier, but not like replacing the artists.

74
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

75
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the coders.

76
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: As it should be, a tool to help jumpstart things, but not to replace things.

77
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the key difference, right?

78
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would see that sort of design as like it's jumpstarting, but it's not doing it all, right?

79
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

80
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:24,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there's a lot of like AI stuff, even like in content creation spaces, like they've got, you know, vidIQ and 2B or whatever the thing is, 2Buddy or I don't remember what it's called now anymore, but I don't use it.

81
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:33,243
[SPEAKER_05]: vidIQ, for example, they'll try to do, hey, we'll use AI to design you a thumbnail or AI to design you like a...

82
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:59,719
[SPEAKER_05]: a title for your video and they usually all suck like they're awful and and so it's like that is that's more of a buzzword and to trying to sell something to somebody doesn't know what exactly that means but a lot of times it's about as good as one of those like random generators like hey I need a I need a Star Wars name for my character let's go to the random generate and keep hitting you know generate and see what we get and

83
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not great.

84
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear Tony Todd passed away this week, which is really sad?

85
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Horror icon.

86
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Candyman was his most famous role.

87
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yeah, yeah.

88
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:13,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so Final Destination, you know, is a really, really, really big loss in the horror community.

89
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:16,544
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been here for the horror conventions a couple times and really sad.

90
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:23,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw, you know, people are posting their tributes online and I saw this one tribute that was an AI-generated art

91
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:44,763
[SPEAKER_02]: of like Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers standing around a tombstone that said Candyman and my only thought I had two thoughts I was like number one I mean no disrespect to Tony Todd who is a legend in the horror industry and everything but the reality is if wouldn't wouldn't serial killers like that be celebrating that somebody died like why would they all be sad

92
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:48,386
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a bit of a logic problem there.

93
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:49,667
[SPEAKER_05]: They're unionized.

94
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,089
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a union.

95
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:51,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently.

96
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: When they lose one of their own, it is a sad time.

97
00:09:56,353 --> 00:10:04,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, that industry is not looked highly upon, but they have their... And the other thing I was like, if I ever pass away...

98
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:31,035
[SPEAKER_02]: please please please please please please please do not honor me with some fucking AI generative thing please do not do that you don't I would rather you just I would rather a white text on black background twitter apology from a corporation I would rather that because at least maybe some thought went into that you know I like you know an AI generated uh Betty White or whatever like crouching in a grave throwing up a peace sign you know like that oh

99
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,835
[SPEAKER_02]: An AI Betty White welcoming me into heaven.

100
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:36,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

101
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's just talk about it.

102
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:50,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if someone could create an AI Betty White that could be your house assistant that you could talk to, I mean, that's not the worst thing that we could be using AI for.

103
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:57,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's just one of those, like, I'm sure we're only moments away from Siri voices being that potentially, you know, or those type of AI assistant.

104
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:58,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it already exists.

105
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:27,709
[SPEAKER_02]: but anyway like I don't want to just you know again it's when it replaces art that it bothers me I actually I'm really intrigued by your idea on where it could go for game development as far as like you know I think that's very interesting the idea of like a game like let's say a little big planet type of game or even like a Dreams like Dreams was really ambitious right and like what if Dreams could sort of have that jump start mode where maybe a prompt like that sort of starts you off and gets you the skeleton and then you're in there filling in the gaps I think that that would be

106
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:28,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of bomb.

107
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really interested in that.

108
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of those things, I wouldn't necessarily say it should be a big open thing.

109
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:41,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Have your own studio come up with your own criteria for your types of game that you make.

110
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:47,775
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's Ubisoft, it's like, okay, where are we going to put our radio towers?

111
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:49,636
[SPEAKER_05]: AI figured that out for us.

112
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:52,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to the effect of like,

113
00:11:53,157 --> 00:12:01,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just generating the general shape of the land and just kind of where, okay, landmarks should go or something like that.

114
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:11,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have the artists come in and like, okay, because it's essentially when you're like prototyping it with like the gray box stuff, you know, that's what you're doing is just laying out where things can go.

115
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:15,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think like AI stepping in to assist with that is going to be like the end of the world.

116
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:18,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh no, it told me to put that crate over there.

117
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,845
[SPEAKER_05]: We're stealing some artist's interpretation of where the crates should go.

118
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:31,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about a game like No Man's Sky, everything, and I love that game, everything on the planets, that is AI in a sense.

119
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:40,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off a generative model type of thing, and it's fine because it's not, you know, everything is generated on the planet.

120
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:43,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the actual, you know, like art that goes into it and all that other stuff.

121
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:43,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

122
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,381
[SPEAKER_02]: BobbyBlackWolf.com

123
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:00,439
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

124
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, PogCulture saying, we need a new Sackboy game.

125
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:22,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Dart2Studio saying, I think there was a newish Lode Runner.

126
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:25,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how the level building stuff worked, if you could share it or not, though.

127
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:26,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think you could.

128
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:36,020
[SPEAKER_02]: But Lode Runner, and I, I love Lode Runner and what it meant for, like, it really is, like, the earliest form of a Mario Maker, that type of thing.

129
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,501
[SPEAKER_02]: But Lode Runner really feels like a dated IP at this point.

130
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:43,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's a really, like, they really just haven't really been able to innovate on that because, and it's,

131
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a relic of a different time, right?

132
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:51,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a very hard thing to innovate on.

133
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:56,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't care for the new Lode Runner that much.

134
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:59,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember playing it just a little bit, but I was like, it just kind of feels dated at this point.

135
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:02,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

136
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:07,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, people are talking about the tribute for me someday, which is a little morbid.

137
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:12,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But DJ Ranma S says, I can picture the Golden Girls and Richard Simmons sitting around a table enjoying mojitos.

138
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:14,714
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly.

139
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:15,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess mojitos are pretty good.

140
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:16,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll accept mojitos.

141
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:19,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

142
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:25,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, the thing we actually wanted to talk about tonight.

143
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:30,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nintendo announced something, but you might have missed it, Loki.

144
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:34,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you did at this point, but Loki, what happened this week with Nintendo?

145
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:45,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So they announced that the Switch successor will be backwards compatible with the Switch, though they announced it like in the middle of all this election nonsense that was going on.

146
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:45,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

147
00:14:46,030 --> 00:15:01,554
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's it was kind of out of nowhere but yeah they said that the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor as well and that yeah it will be backwards compatible with your game library.

148
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:14,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and to be fair and I'm sure you know this but for everybody out there be sure to critically think why would Nintendo announce this right in the middle of all the election fuckery in America because where is Nintendo based?

149
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:20,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan, and they were doing a scheduled earnings call, just like they tend to do in America with those companies.

150
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the Japanese calendar is not going to revolve around American stuff.

151
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it was nighttime here, it was daytime over there.

152
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the perfect time for the earnings call.

153
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we all understand the timing of that now.

154
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:35,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those weird coincidence type of things.

155
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that was self-explanatory.

156
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:41,333
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to clear the confusion, because I definitely saw

157
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:49,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple people out there who, you know, and I can understand why people were letting their guard down on election night a little bit, but, you know, you all got to critically think a little bit.

158
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:52,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Nintendo follow the American calendar?

159
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:52,995
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't.

160
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

161
00:15:56,116 --> 00:16:01,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But a little more about, like, why this news probably came out overall, you know, I was kind of thinking about it a little bit.

162
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:10,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this might be, and the reason why they've announced it now in November before the Prime shopping season is simply that they don't want to cannibalize sales of Switch software.

163
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's it.

164
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:33,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, still, the games that are coming out throughout the holiday season, Nintendo wants to assure you that if you buy it, you're not just going to suddenly not be able to play it anymore.

165
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,323
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think that that was a real concern for people.

166
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:44,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think sometimes towards the end of life for a certain console may make them a little sluggish, like, well, why would I buy this new game now?

167
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,250
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

168
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,560
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

169
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:20,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was the Wii and Wii U like that.

170
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:24,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I think you still have to repurchase everything, if I remember correctly.

171
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it kind of sucks.

172
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:31,121
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to transfer from one console to the next, which is just dumb.

173
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:36,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping that this century... You would boot your Wii U into a Wii mode.

174
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could transfer everything from your Wii, if I remember right.

175
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:41,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

176
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Gosh, we forget how dumb these things were in the past.

177
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:50,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking it'll be a little smoother this time, but we'll see.

178
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:51,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

179
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:55,949
[SPEAKER_02]: RecordWN says, so we thinking holiday next year or what?

180
00:17:57,251 --> 00:18:00,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I think probably end of March.

181
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,126
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely disappointing, to put it mildly, that things went the way they did.

183
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,771
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things negative I could say about that.

184
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:39,117
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know right now is that we're gonna probably need community and we're gonna need each other more than ever.

185
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:51,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you've got to really find your people and find your community and take care of each other because Lord knows the rest of the world, or at least the rest of America, excuse me, specifically, the rest of America does not give a shit about you.

186
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:52,242
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

187
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:58,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of America will sell you up the fucking river for cheaper gas and eggs, or excuse me, the illusion of cheaper gas and eggs.

188
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, this is extremely disappointing.

189
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:08,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it weird how the gas prices are coming down even though there's not a new president in office yet?

190
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so strange.

191
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:11,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like they're unconnected.

192
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:12,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

193
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:27,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've been trying to unpack and there's been a lot of finger pointing and blame placing, especially people that are generally liberal, blaming other people who are generally liberal, which is really the worst possible thing you could do right now.

194
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:28,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really interested in doing that.

195
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:36,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say if I had to go down that route, I think it's very obvious to me that the person who made the wrong decision was Joe Biden.

196
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:55,615
[SPEAKER_02]: and I completely respect Joe Biden and think he's done a lot of great things to this country but the fact that he did not read the tea leaves a lot sooner the fact that he kind of went back on his you know one term he was going to be pass it on to the younger generation that whole thing a long time ago and went back on that he waited way too fucking late to drop out in this process

197
00:19:56,715 --> 00:20:01,138
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rob did the party of a primary process and all the things that come with that.

198
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:03,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think Kamala Harris is a great fucking candidate.

199
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:10,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think especially considering the circumstances, she ran a hell of a fucking campaign when you consider it was only, what, 100 days?

200
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the states where they focused all the attention, those seven swing states, did they win them?

201
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:16,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

202
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But did they close the gap closer than they did in the states where she wasn't running the TV ads and those sorts of things constantly?

203
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:29,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's almost as if the country had more time to kind of get to know her as a candidate.

204
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:32,373
[SPEAKER_02]: There would have probably been a higher chance that that would have happened.

205
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:38,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would prefer to have a choice, though, of who was running instead of just like, I mean, yeah, that's going to be them.

206
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:39,815
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been nice.

207
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:41,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I

208
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:46,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think in that situation, there's a lot of me that probably would have went for Kamala anyway, but we'll never know.

209
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, that decision from Joe Biden ruined us of that opportunity.

210
00:20:51,342 --> 00:21:08,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm not here to shit on him because he's done a lot contrary to what other people will try to tell you when it comes to the economy, when it comes to us rebounding out of COVID, when it comes to a lot of the things we have access to and sanity and all that stuff, he's done a lot.

211
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,033
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

212
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:28,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I want to kind of move on from that part of it because the other part of that, and this is very important, this is the other reason why we lost.

213
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:41,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what folks who can't stand Trump and everything, folks that are the worst of the worst, this is what they're doing very well.

214
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,471
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

215
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,327
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

216
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,508
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple different ways, quite frankly.

217
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:23,394
[SPEAKER_02]: They decide to tell you what the meaning is behind that and push that in your face over and over and over and over and over again.

218
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:35,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's these – you could find very easily a hundred cases of hypocrisy where one side does one thing, the other side does the exact same thing, but it's always the left's fault every single time.

219
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,261
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not just Fox News.

220
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these series of podcasts that are out there.

221
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:48,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these series of influencers, YouTube and it's also now social media.

222
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:51,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's X. It's that website.

223
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: which we all know what happened to X. And no, I'm not going to call it Twitter anymore.

224
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:57,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter's fucking dead.

225
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter is fucking dead and it's been dead for years.

226
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:03,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's X. And X is a right-wing platform.

227
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a big problem.

228
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:17,919
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't have, when you look at all those things, when you look at influential left podcasts, when you look at influential TV networks that are played in the dentist's office in the South of America, when you look at all those things, we don't have any of that.

229
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,140
[SPEAKER_02]: None of it.

230
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

231
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:29,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Until we're able to fix that and get the messaging out more effectively, then maybe when we have a 100-day campaign, we can get things out.

232
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think the view is going to do it?

233
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:32,455
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

234
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:34,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think MSNBC is influential enough?

235
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

236
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,678
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of people that are tuned in to niche news channels that much.

237
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: How many dentist offices are playing MSNBC in different parts of the country?

238
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shouldn't really be tilted any way, one way or the other, to be quite frank.

239
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:51,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I realize that might be a lot of politics for you all.

240
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:52,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really care.

241
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:57,060
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that are going to affect my life and me personally.

242
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sit here and hope for the best, but I'm absolutely going to prepare for the worst.

243
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:06,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't need a fucking lecture from other people trying to tell me how to feel about it.

244
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:08,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't.

245
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:10,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking spare me.

246
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:13,446
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tell me that I have nothing to worry about, great.

247
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:18,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you actively work to make sure that I have nothing to worry about?

248
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Because words are fucking empty.

249
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:29,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the messaging too that they say that we have to rally around this new president despite the fact for the last four years they have been saying fake.

250
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:31,131
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hypocrisy thing, right?

251
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:32,212
[SPEAKER_02]: All that again.

252
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:33,334
[SPEAKER_02]: All that again.

253
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:35,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So just anyway, I'm over it.

254
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, believe it or not, yes, I remember this all started with a chat comment.

255
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Record WN in chat says, so we thinking holiday next year or what?

256
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:45,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Record at WN.

257
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't blame you for the political tangent.

258
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:48,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It was coming either way.

259
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,336
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the answer to this question the more I think about it.

260
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:56,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo was supposed to announce that successor console this year, at least for all intents and purposes.

261
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,164
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't, and we've all been frustrated by that.

262
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:00,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Why haven't they announced the successor console yet?

263
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're waiting some of this out.

264
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:05,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what's going to happen.

265
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:15,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at this point, I think everything that's happened in America, you just confirmed this console's not getting announced until next summer because they don't know what it's going to cost.

266
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo cannot come out now and say the Switch successor's going to cost $499.

267
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:21,212
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do it.

268
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:21,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know.

269
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,593
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what things are going to cost now.

270
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:25,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know if that's why.

271
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:40,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when they said this year, I think they're talking about this financial year, which they still have time, and I still think it's going to be kind of along the lines of how they announced the Switch, which was it was basically a few months prior to it coming out, and then it was out.

272
00:25:40,606 --> 00:26:09,821
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that's what they're going to do again because they don't really need to go any longer than that and tariffs or not I think they're still going to I mean they're not going to like hold the console just because of tariffs and it's going to take some time before that even gets in place and I'm sure there's people going to talk them out of it because it's a dumb idea anyways everyone's like yeah it's good because he's an idiot and doesn't understand how tariffs work and that the price what corporations absorb that cost god no you know the consumer will absorb that cost

273
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:13,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about all the people that are googling what are tariffs after election day.

274
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:15,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other issue.

275
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:16,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the communication issue.

276
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That should have been known a long time ago.

277
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,583
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of embarrassing things I've seen.

278
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a whole segment on, was it Kimmel or whatever, talking about people saying, hey, so who are you voting for in the election?

279
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:30,005
[SPEAKER_05]: This was literally the day after the election.

280
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,785
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, oh yeah, I'm voting for this person.

281
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:33,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ready to vote tonight.

282
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:35,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know that was yesterday, right?

283
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:36,886
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just...

284
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:41,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, there's so many reasons to be disappointed with people.

285
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's 10 million people that sat at home.

286
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:47,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, okay, okay, well then don't complain.

287
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to hear any complaint from these people.

288
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:57,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the lesson I've learned is that Americans don't give a fuck about me.

289
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:58,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.

290
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,924
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's the lesson I'm taking away from all this.

291
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:06,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take precautions to protect me and my people and the people I care about.

292
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that are celebrating this, you can all have each other.

293
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not ring my phone when problems start.

294
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:17,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not ring my phone.

295
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:17,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I am busy.

296
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:26,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, we don't know what these things are going to cost now.

297
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, how fast can these things really move?

298
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already know that now there's going to be all these legal challenges.

299
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's kind of interesting.

300
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:43,241
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to use some of his strategies against him and try to delay, delay, delay with the legal process and all this stuff.

301
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

302
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,756
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

303
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:49,336
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

304
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:58,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember the first time he was in office, every morning we'd wake up and it's that Picard meme going, damage report.

305
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be what it is for the next little while.

306
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wake up every morning and go, damage report.

307
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,120
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to be more expensive today?

308
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,361
[SPEAKER_02]: What fucking tweet started a symbol under us now?

309
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:11,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you worry.

310
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:16,647
[SPEAKER_05]: When the four years is up, I'm sure they'll blame the Democrats for anything that he fucked up in office.

311
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:17,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

312
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:22,392
[SPEAKER_02]: When they have full control of the entire government, I'm sure somehow it will still be Democrats' fault.

313
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:32,202
[SPEAKER_05]: When the measles have come back because, you know, RFK is going to go wild with healthcare, that'll be why.

314
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:34,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, do not call.

315
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:40,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that Kamala meme of her going, do not come.

316
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:40,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not come.

317
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,915
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me right now.

318
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,936
[SPEAKER_02]: When everything goes to hell, do not call.

319
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:45,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not call.

320
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not call.

321
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:49,199
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, Blue Sky is nice.

322
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Blue Sky.

323
00:28:51,260 --> 00:29:01,265
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I will say about Blue Sky that is kind of nice, you know how they have those giant lists of all these horrible MAGA people or Nazi people that list their stuff in the comments?

324
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Sky has an option where you can go to those lists and ban them all or block them all.

325
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:07,028
[SPEAKER_05]: All at once.

326
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:07,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so great.

327
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:08,970
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to go one by one.

328
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,772
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just hundreds of people you'll never have to hear from ever.

329
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:19,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Blocking is a great mechanism on Blue Sky because it works even differently than X because they vanish.

330
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:24,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you just like literally like you never existed and they never existed.

331
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's fabulous.

332
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:28,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you haven't looked into Blue Sky yet, it's great.

333
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:32,122
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at least for now, I'm sure people will come in and ruin it later.

334
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:42,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know the interesting thing about Blue Sky is it's built on a back end where like it's literally bought, built, excuse me, so the Elon Musk situation can't happen.

335
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:44,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can come in and buy Blue Sky.

336
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:49,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they did, everybody can take because it's all built on that app protocol thing.

337
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:52,567
[SPEAKER_02]: You could take what's built there and move it to another infrastructure.

338
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:53,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.

339
00:29:54,529 --> 00:30:03,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like Mastodon a lot in that way, except a little more centralized than Mastodon was, which solves the problem of being easier to use.

340
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:07,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would really encourage people to look into that website.

341
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:13,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But also at the same time, it's not like Blue Sky is some big bubble that is problem-free.

342
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:20,004
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all the regular problems in social media are still going to be there, but it's just you have more tools and just less noise.

343
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the problem with X is that

344
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:26,928
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pay Elon Musk money, you can get your replies boosted to the top.

345
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:35,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And he pays people based on the ad revenue, people to write stupid clickbait, engaging shit, not just in their posts, but in the comments.

346
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:36,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just things to get elevated.

347
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:37,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a...

348
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: X is built to be an echo chamber.

349
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you want to hear a funny story.

350
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:54,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So when our friends recently got married, or she got remarried, and her brother, he is a photographer.

351
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,833
[SPEAKER_05]: He does a lot of that, like...

352
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:03,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like astronomy, but it's like a lot of like pictures of the night sky.

353
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:07,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's got a telescope, takes a lot of pictures with his telescope and posts them on there.

354
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's got a very big account.

355
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 300,000 followers now.

356
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:16,702
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, on the posts I get the most traction on are the ones that are like kind of

357
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:43,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Open up and then someone starts having like this flat earth like starts arguing back and forth like the most toxic stuff ever but he just gets paid so much for it not that he's contributing to any of that he's just posting pictures of stars you know and stuff like that but but people that are on there just like churning all that stuff is like get all the ad views and he makes tons of money off of that stuff yeah he's like yeah it's it's it's gross but it's a living

358
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:46,687
[SPEAKER_02]: S. Jonah and Matt says, avoid giving X any engagements.

359
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That owner had a direct hand and all of this is cheap propagandist.

360
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:49,388
100,000%.

361
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:52,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's still going to be on the cabinet, too.

362
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:54,630
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to be in charge of, like, what is it?

363
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,430
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to probably be in charge of the FCC and stuff.

364
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:59,011
[SPEAKER_02]: In charge of giving himself more money.

365
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:00,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

366
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:01,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

367
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:08,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, tangent, but I'm also not going to apologize for the way I feel.

368
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:13,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's too many streamers out there that's like, I don't want to get political because I might risk her alienating people.

369
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck.

370
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:16,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Be alienated.

371
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:17,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess how I feel.

372
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:19,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think I don't feel alienated?

373
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:21,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck.

374
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:28,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very popular to say on the other side, fuck your feelings.

375
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really feel good when it goes the other way, does it?

376
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

377
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:25,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I played mostly Minecraft and I've been you know working on the theme park stuff so I posted a video earlier this week talking about like some of the new rides I got the boardwalk all done so I had a couple mini games that I put together and all that stuff and inspiration for those and so I have another one that I just made um as well and I was working on some other things with that uh we were talking we had a meeting today so we were talking like

378
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:30,684
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on for next season and wrapping things up because we're going to be ending

379
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon, like December sometime, probably by the end of the year.

380
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're gonna have a month off and then start in February.

381
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:42,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I can get done by then.

382
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking two weeks off next week.

383
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:49,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to, well, I'm taking it off to work on Minecraft stuff.

384
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:52,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, cause I have this giant water ride.

385
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:55,129
[SPEAKER_02]: In your creative space for a little while.

386
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I have tomorrow off and I'll probably work on videos and stuff too.

387
00:33:58,592 --> 00:33:58,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

388
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:00,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good call out.

389
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:23,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I do play mindless stuff, so unfortunately one of our cast members got me somewhat hooked on Farm Merge Valley.

390
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:28,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just this awful... It's the most mobile of mobile games.

391
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:33,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's completely a time waster, no brain whatsoever.

392
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:40,501
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's what I've used to decompress from work, so I'll usually play 30 minutes of that to kind of just...

393
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:47,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn My Brain Off, and then once my brain is off or de-stressed from work, then I go into working on Minecraft stuff.

394
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:50,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been doing a lot of that type of stuff.

395
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:56,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'm pretty far in that too, because I've been playing it a lot.

396
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:58,849
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's pretty much it.

397
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've really played anything else.

398
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:05,472
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like I said, I tried out the AI in Minecraft thing.

399
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:06,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty dumb.

400
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:09,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I got bored with that pretty much after one time.

401
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:35,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking to start new projects you know especially with next season coming up and then hopefully in between things I would looking to do that to just do like a single player series or something so I can get back into playing Minecraft just for fun or not just for fun but like with more fun you're you're more content that's focused on playing Minecraft than just building things especially this season's kind of ended up like last season where it's just like

402
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:48,788
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of like prep stuff and then it's like rush rush rush rush at the end and just build a ton of stuff at the end and that's kind of I was trying to avoid that this season and I fell right back into it again so

403
00:35:50,283 --> 00:36:09,209
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll see what next season happens I think you bring up a really good point though about like you know sometimes especially when you're a content creator you have to play games just to have fun right because that's how you get burned out otherwise if it's always like a work work work mentality so I think that's a really good idea to just have a little fun with it and you know remind yourself why you enjoy the game so much and create content for it

404
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:24,842
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a good idea yeah it's just it's yeah kind of going back and forth with different things and different audiences like to watch some people just like to watch people play Minecraft or or take it a bit slower um which is fine we don't have the luxury to do that when we have a timed time

405
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:37,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Season, so the season's a bit longer than normal, but it typically runs for about a year, so I kind of, if I'm looking to do these very large-scale projects, I have to hit the ground running, like, fast.

406
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:39,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a sprint the entire time.

407
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:51,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And if something holds me up, like in the case of this water ride, which designing it is... It's been months already, been in the design process for this, and it's... I mean, I gotta get... This is...

408
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:53,134
[SPEAKER_05]: do or die time.

409
00:36:53,174 --> 00:37:02,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to get it done within these two weeks or it's just it's probably going to extend past the end of the season, you know, so we'll see, though.

410
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:03,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a lot to do.

411
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:07,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the next two weeks off, but then isn't Thanksgiving the week after that?

412
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:09,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right.

413
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:10,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not the next two.

414
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:15,874
[SPEAKER_05]: So this week I have work, and then it's week before Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving week.

415
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:16,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

416
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:16,955
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

417
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

418
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would be even better, though.

419
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:23,704
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're taking two weeks, then it's like you work, what, like three days, and then you have another two days off.

420
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:24,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be nice.

421
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, our...

422
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:30,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Department would fall apart because, yeah, it's all that.

423
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:40,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still waiting to see, you know, because one of the things that we're voting on in California was the minimum wage to go up, so that'd be kind of nice if my minimum exempt wage would go up again.

424
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:42,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the only way I get raises around here?

425
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,460
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years of experience, get paid minimum wage.

426
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds great.

427
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Great deal.

428
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:53,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

429
00:37:53,823 --> 00:37:54,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

430
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:56,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks talking about that they're playing the Castlevania Collection.

431
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:00,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Loki, your channel got a shout out there.

432
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

433
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about my game of the week.

434
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:49,407
[SPEAKER_02]: at least for now I still have those rights to be able to do that and you know unless the constitution goes completely to hell I should be able to continue to do that to my heart's content as should all of you and it's because of veterans who you know ensure that our interests are withheld so yes thank you Ranma I know you're a veteran I don't know who else in chat specifically is so thank you and I'm sorry I forget in the moment but I'm sure we have folks out there listening as well

435
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:53,996
[SPEAKER_02]: who aren't as active in chat or just kind of lurking on the podcast and what have you.

436
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:55,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you as well.

437
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate that.

438
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: My Gaming Week.

439
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, since we're talking YouTube channels, I have one too where I do retro gameplays and I did a video for, what did I do?

440
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:12,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Do was on the Atari 2600, which is a very interesting sort of arcade translation.

441
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:24,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this was a week of 80s arcade translations because I did Donkey Kong on Monday as well for the Atari 2600, which it's interesting to see all the corners they cut to make both these games fit in the size of an Atari 2600 cartridge.

442
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:30,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It really makes you appreciate how hard those programmers really worked to squeeze things down to fit into a cartridge.

443
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:35,638
[SPEAKER_02]: But boy, especially in Mr. Do, it's like the screen draws only two-thirds of the screen.

444
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:36,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe three-fourths.

445
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:42,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I don't think... I never played the 2600 version, just the Coleco version, and that one was pretty good.

446
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:42,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But 2600...

447
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they make a lot of concessions, but it's not as bad as Pac-Man.

448
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because I was noticing this in Donkey Kong as well.

449
00:39:53,553 --> 00:40:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially to somebody who's a lot younger, a kid, you get the essence of what the game was.

450
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Donkey Kong...

451
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,804
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see that first level, that's an iconic level, that first level in Donkey Kong, right?

452
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:10,427
[SPEAKER_02]: With the pink, you know, construction, you know, lines and all that stuff.

453
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:12,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you recognize that when you see it.

454
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:16,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And Atari 2600 Donkey Kong kind of translates that best it can.

455
00:40:17,593 --> 00:40:20,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're able to sort of see that.

456
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:23,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mr. Dew, they kind of tried to do the same thing.

457
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man, they had to cut too many corners.

458
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it looks a little weird.

459
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I only did the two videos this week.

460
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:32,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to do a third, but I wasn't feeling it Tuesday night.

461
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't imagine why.

462
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did.

463
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:36,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I also posted a Diablo 4 gameplay video.

464
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:37,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a random thing.

465
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I wonder what kind of traction this will get.

466
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

467
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Got more traction than anything else I've posted in the last month.

468
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:45,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

469
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to do some more Diablo 4 videos.

470
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:48,502
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

471
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been playing quite a bit of that as well.

472
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And still some more Final Fantasy XIV.

473
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I also played the opening hours of Dragon Age The Veil Guard.

474
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:00,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I played about three hours of that on stream.

475
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:03,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's still early.

476
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of complaints about the story.

477
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:07,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do see things where it's like...

478
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:08,584
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

479
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Graphically, it looks really good.

480
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:34,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the combat so far.

481
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually really satisfying.

482
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:46,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a part of me that's like, honestly, if the next Mass Effect is done very similarly to this, like if it's in the same engine, I'm really hyped about it, to be quite honest.

483
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is really, really awesome.

484
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:50,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

485
00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:00,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so so far I feel pretty good about Dragon Age, but I'll need to dive more into it to really know about the story and everything else.

486
00:42:00,362 --> 00:42:03,283
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, RecordWN says, I like the way that game looks.

487
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:03,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.

488
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:05,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it as well.

489
00:42:05,904 --> 00:42:13,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonds006 says, did not serve, but did two years of Army ROTC right out of high school, Reserve Office Training Corps.

490
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, reserve is important as well.

491
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.

492
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:21,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, what else did I play this week?

493
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it.

494
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all the big ones.

495
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I mentioned the little party I went to.

496
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:28,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the other game I'll mention that I played at the party.

497
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had yet to use this.

498
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:34,618
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Taiko no Tatsujin on the PlayStation 4.

499
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've played it because it was on Xbox Game Pass for a hot minute.

500
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:40,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But they actually had the drum controller.

501
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:44,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had yet to use a drum controller in a very long time.

502
00:42:44,465 --> 00:42:45,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was fun.

503
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:54,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was like, oh, I wish I could justify spending, thinking I would put enough hours into this game to justify the cost of this.

504
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think I could.

505
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:59,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But I enjoyed getting to kind of play the game with the controller again.

506
00:42:59,796 --> 00:43:00,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super cute.

507
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:01,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Tycho.

508
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a cute little game.

509
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

510
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on then.

511
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,222
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's our Gaming Weeks, let's talk about some other headlines.

512
00:43:09,362 --> 00:43:10,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go to you, Loki.

513
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:17,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got some more details regarding that whole PowWorld lawsuit from Nintendo.

514
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:22,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, like we talked about before, there's... You would think it was about...

515
00:43:23,837 --> 00:43:25,398
[SPEAKER_05]: The designs of the pals.

516
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:26,498
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it's not.

517
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:34,622
[SPEAKER_05]: It is about different systems that Nintendo has patented, which have some interesting dates to them.

518
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:36,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's three.

519
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:41,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So Pocket Pair has come out basically talking about the whole lawsuit and everything.

520
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:51,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically that the company, they want 10 million yen from Pocket Pair to

521
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:55,833
[SPEAKER_05]: between the two violations.

522
00:43:56,253 --> 00:44:00,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So part of it's going to Nintendo and the other is to the Pokemon company.

523
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:05,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I've watched some kind of analysis of this.

524
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:15,304
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea, I think, that they're trying to do is to set precedent that they can sue these companies and have them pay them for these violations.

525
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:18,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's where we come into some problems.

526
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:24,314
[SPEAKER_05]: One, these patents were registered after Palworld was released.

527
00:44:25,774 --> 00:44:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: These patents are for gameplay that's very generic.

528
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:40,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first patent has to do with a system where a player aims and fires an item towards a character in the field and doing so triggers combat.

529
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they talk about also capturing mobs with that.

530
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:46,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they said...

531
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:50,965
[SPEAKER_05]: The ability to capture Pokemon in the wild.

532
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:55,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there is one that was rather only during battle.

533
00:44:55,528 --> 00:45:03,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the third was to some modification requiring it basically allowing you to switch mounts in game pretty easily.

534
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:34,187
[SPEAKER_05]: and so all of these patents were registered so they applied for the patent like the first one was applied for July 30th 2024 registered August 27th 2024 well after PAL World was out the next one February 26th May 22nd was the one that was registered March 5th July 26th so these have been released well after the game came out so it's almost like saying

535
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:59,570
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, hypothetically speaking I'm going to patent the idea of the Triforce I'm going to patent the Triforce and I'm going to sue Nintendo despite the fact that they've had games with the Triforce in it or whatever this symbology for like a long time it makes no sense and it seems very frivolous

536
00:46:00,418 --> 00:46:03,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, you know, Pocket Pair is a smaller company.

537
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, they are a smaller company that has now a lot of money from the sales of this.

538
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:14,467
[SPEAKER_05]: But even still, to fight Nintendo on this, they could drag this out for a very long time.

539
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:15,428
[SPEAKER_05]: In

540
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:23,009
[SPEAKER_05]: What should have happened is I don't think that these patents should have been given to Nintendo in the first place.

541
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if they're trying to patent things that are already existing and it's very generic, the gameplay.

542
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:39,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, if you want to even argue, I mean, granted, Nintendo's had capturing Pokemon for a while now in other games.

543
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:45,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, I think Arceus was the first one that they actually did more of a in-the-wild

544
00:46:46,621 --> 00:47:14,713
[SPEAKER_02]: but the previous game that Pocket Pair released actually had that type of gameplay already in it prior to I think Legends Arceus so I don't know yeah Nintendo's kind of losing me here because I just like if you're going to go after something go after the design of the creatures that's the biggest thing that sticks out to me like I don't understand why this isn't an argument about that especially with all the merchandise maybe it's a way to like

545
00:47:15,273 --> 00:47:17,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Get Discovery so that they can figure that out?

546
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:19,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

547
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:19,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

548
00:47:20,396 --> 00:47:27,099
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a couple ways, and I'm looking at the comments in chat, and SHO100Matt points out 10 million yen is $65,000, roughly.

549
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:28,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's weird.

550
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly a ton of money that's going to shut down, you know, the PAL world, folks.

551
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:37,044
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, SHO100Matt continues, this feels more like a shakedown than anything.

552
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:43,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is hoping the pocket pair will settle so they don't have to deal with Nintendo's lawyers drying this out for years and costing them money.

553
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other thing I can think of, and I know this is a long shot, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that...

554
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is a defensive maneuver.

555
00:47:52,828 --> 00:48:01,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds really weird, but we know all these things that they are getting patents on sound like things that are part of Pokemon Legends, specifically, right?

556
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the throwing an item to engage in battle, that's a Legends thing.

557
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing mounts, that's a Legends thing.

558
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:13,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of me wonders if they aren't trying to put these into place to have...

559
00:48:14,864 --> 00:48:15,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they would-

560
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:53,889
[SPEAKER_05]: it's really weird and it's also like if they were going to why wait until after your game is released to then like well after your game is released to patent these things

561
00:48:54,605 --> 00:48:55,326
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

562
00:49:13,227 --> 00:49:14,810
[SPEAKER_02]: We can keep making it up, but we don't know.

563
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's obviously a million different ways this could be going.

564
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:20,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be fascinating to see after the fact.

565
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:24,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's also very likely that Pocket Pair does settle.

566
00:49:24,425 --> 00:49:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the terms of the settlement, can't talk about it.

567
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:27,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll never know.

568
00:49:29,448 --> 00:49:35,810
[SPEAKER_05]: It says all three patents are successful requests to modify previously established patents.

569
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:40,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It says each notably designed to match newer features.

570
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:46,754
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess they have had other things patented, but now they're kind of bringing it more to the current.

571
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:54,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, I don't think that still applies, though, even if they did have a patent for capturing Pokemon in battle or something like that.

572
00:49:54,877 --> 00:49:55,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

573
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:56,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Tough shit.

574
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:59,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they did something different and you want to patent it.

575
00:49:59,256 --> 00:49:59,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

576
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:00,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

577
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:07,019
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just gonna... First off, let's, like, I mean, patent reform needs to happen across the world anyways.

578
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't be able to patent game mechanics.

579
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:09,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

580
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, anything should not be patentable.

581
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,102
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to, you know, copyright your characters and your scenarios and all that type of stuff, that's fine.

582
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:19,923
[SPEAKER_05]: But patenting game mechanics?

583
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:20,563
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

584
00:50:20,703 --> 00:50:22,264
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be thrown out right away.

585
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:23,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

586
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:26,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous, this type of stuff.

587
00:50:27,476 --> 00:50:32,881
[SPEAKER_05]: We go back to the whole Namco patenting the ability to play minigames while loading.

588
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:40,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, load screens are not really a thing anymore, but we never got to live in a world that had those because they fucked it up for everybody else.

589
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:43,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least the patents should expire a lot quicker.

590
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:44,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 20 years.

591
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:53,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it needs to be a lot quicker, because the Namco loading screen thing, that expired now, so people can do it, but you're right, there's really no loading screens anymore.

592
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:56,555
[SPEAKER_05]: How long ago was Pokemon released?

593
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:58,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, Pokemon was like the late 90s.

594
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Late 90s.

595
00:51:00,656 --> 00:51:06,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So are they altering these patents so they can keep the patent on the whole Pokeball throwing thing?

596
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:07,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's been over 20 years?

597
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:09,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

598
00:51:10,973 --> 00:51:12,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been closer to 30 years, Loki.

599
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:16,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, right, but it's like they tweaked it before or something like that.

600
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:17,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

601
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:17,945
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll never know.

602
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:18,647
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll never know.

603
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:19,328
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll never know.

604
00:51:20,217 --> 00:51:24,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, before I get to the next story though, I should point out, I have to say something about this at some point.

605
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,102
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some things apparently we do know here at Orange Lounge Radio.

606
00:51:28,303 --> 00:51:31,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't know if you remember, but we were talking about Nintendo music last week.

607
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:33,046
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember this on the show?

608
00:51:33,486 --> 00:51:40,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was saying, I swear to God, I remember talking on OLR about this and saying that this is like, this is a thing that Nintendo should do.

609
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

610
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:43,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

611
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:45,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody found the clip.

612
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:48,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So 13XForever, kudos to you.

613
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:50,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm betting dimes to dollars.

614
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because 13XForever wrote that transcription thing that went through and transcribed all the episodes of our show.

615
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:59,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm betting he just searched and found the episode we were talking about it in.

616
00:52:00,177 --> 00:52:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually found that in episode 901 from January 30th of 2022, I said the following.

617
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry, Loki, you're not going to hear this, but I'm going to play this for listeners.

618
00:52:13,044 --> 00:52:13,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

619
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:23,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, every streaming service out there, you name it, has at least like orchestral versions, covers, remixes, and things that are a lot harder for Nintendo to touch.

620
00:52:24,048 --> 00:52:29,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the originals, it's really, really, they don't want that for whatever reason.

621
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:33,092
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster in chat says, to be honest, I'm surprised it took this long.

622
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:33,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of same.

623
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:38,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I wish Nintendo gave us more options to actually buy their music.

624
00:52:38,295 --> 00:52:39,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, definitely.

625
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:42,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm hearing in the YouTube channel owner's comments.

626
00:52:43,718 --> 00:52:45,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the frustration is.

627
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,261
[SPEAKER_02]: At least put the music up on streaming services then.

628
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:51,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you think the streaming services don't pay enough, you know what?

629
00:52:51,644 --> 00:52:55,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on part of the Nintendo Online subscription.

630
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:57,328
[SPEAKER_02]: A Nintendo Music Player.

631
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:00,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, what a novel idea.

632
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:04,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure, it's going to take a little bit of development time to build that.

633
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

634
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it would take a ton.

635
00:53:07,132 --> 00:53:09,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be a lot of people that would be super into that.

636
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:17,336
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of you would be down for a Nintendo music player as a part of your online Switch membership?

637
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:20,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, they've already kind of got one in Smash Bros.

638
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I see Bobby Blackwell pointing that out.

639
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:25,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But y'all know that's a little different.

640
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:25,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Because A...

641
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:31,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very comprehensive, but it's not all-encompassing.

642
00:53:32,763 --> 00:53:35,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And B, it is kind of buried away in the game.

643
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:37,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it.

644
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:37,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

645
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:40,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is a lot of the music in Smash Bros.

646
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they take that out and put it on Nintendo Online?

647
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:45,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

648
00:53:46,826 --> 00:53:47,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

649
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yes, I have to stroke my ego just a little bit here on this program.

650
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's why.

651
00:53:54,414 --> 00:53:55,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to break this down for you.

652
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:58,458
[SPEAKER_02]: If it sounds like Rob has an ego, it's actually not that.

653
00:53:58,478 --> 00:54:01,261
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to tell you why when shit like that happens, I'm going to rub it in.

654
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:02,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

655
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:21,873
[SPEAKER_02]: in this industry a lot of times these larger gaming websites tend to go to these investor people that have these ideas and there's one in particular I'm thinking of but I'm not going to name names because I'm a nice person that always has these things to say that don't make any sense at all and don't seem to be rooted in reality

656
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:29,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, people like Loki, myself, and DarkSakura have been commenting on this industry for 20 years plus.

657
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:36,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to have some sort of critical thinking when it comes to this stuff and evaluating this.

658
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't take this seriously.

659
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:45,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we take what we do here in gaming and commenting, we have fun with it, sure, but we take it very seriously here.

660
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:50,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I have to turn around and go to E3 and back in the day, yes, this is a little bit of sour grapes.

661
00:54:51,593 --> 00:55:00,515
[SPEAKER_02]: have to justify our existence on why we're getting to do something like this, and yet we're able to make these same types of predictions, and you know what?

662
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:01,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we get it really, really well.

663
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:10,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to think, I called that that was going to be, well, or said it should be Nintendo Online, which I don't think was something anybody else said.

664
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:17,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if E3 still existed, we'd still go there, could show them the whole Guinness Book of World Records thing, and they'd be like,

665
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:21,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Alexa rankings say this.

666
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, I know.

667
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:27,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, DJ Ranma S says, okay, Rob, what's the Mega Millions numbers?

668
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,891
[SPEAKER_02]: 42, 69, 13, 420, hut, hut, hut.

669
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:35,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

670
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:36,672
[SPEAKER_02]: This is funny.

671
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:41,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had said, oh yeah, Fifth Dream says, Rob needs to sue Nintendo for infringement.

672
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:42,934
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think the whole thing is funny.

673
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:45,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the whole thing's funny.

674
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:49,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not actually that worked out, but I think it's kind of funny.

675
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:53,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I still stand by everything I said about Nintendo Music last week.

676
00:55:53,294 --> 00:56:01,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of two years too late, so it's really funny that I said that then because that was the time for Nintendo to release it.

677
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:03,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

678
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm done running my victory lap.

679
00:56:07,677 --> 00:56:09,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You knew I was going to say something, right, Loki?

680
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:13,241
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you saw that clip hit the Discord, you knew I was going to say something, didn't you?

681
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

682
00:56:16,204 --> 00:56:16,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

683
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:23,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about kind of a warning, I guess, for those of you that might need to pick up one of these adapters.

684
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:33,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what this might be saying about the future of this too, but let's talk about the free PlayStation 5 PlayStation camera adapter for PlayStation VR.

685
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:37,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is going to be stopping soon offering this adapter.

686
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:41,792
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to allow you to connect your PlayStation camera to your PlayStation 5.

687
00:56:42,513 --> 00:56:44,273
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the camera that was released for the PS4.

688
00:56:45,053 --> 00:57:03,366
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course you had to have it to use the original PlayStation VR on the current console and then the HD camera isn't compatible with the original PlayStation VR so you needed this if you wanted to play the original PSVR through the system and all that stuff because the VR systems are very very different

689
00:57:04,423 --> 00:57:08,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So as of November 26th, the PlayStation Camera Adapter will no longer be available.

690
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,709
[SPEAKER_02]: That is set on a Sony support page.

691
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:17,275
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still request an adapter via a form or you can call Sony to get that.

692
00:57:17,616 --> 00:57:21,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a serial number from the processing unit of the PSVR to get it.

693
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,223
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, PSVR games do not run on the PSVR 2 platform.

694
00:57:26,264 --> 00:57:35,934
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just things that are available on the original PSVR, but to be able to play them on your PS5 because PS5 is backwards compatible with PlayStation 4.

695
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:40,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, when I hear something like that, I'm kind of two mindsets.

696
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,442
[SPEAKER_02]: One, the clock could have run out on it and it's just, you know, whatever.

697
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:48,426
[SPEAKER_02]: But two, I'm kind of like, is this a sign that maybe the PlayStation VR...

698
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,060
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of like they're just kind of walking away from it.

699
00:57:52,100 --> 00:58:01,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize this particular adapter doesn't really have anything to do with the VR2, but it just kind of makes me go like, what is Sony's thing on VR right now?

700
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:02,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does Sony stand with VR?

701
00:58:02,342 --> 00:58:04,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they already are walking away from it.

702
00:58:04,203 --> 00:58:16,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we had like some other like some story about it because I remember vaguely that they were kind of like just done with it or that it's not they're not really pushing it.

703
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:21,301
[SPEAKER_05]: and that, you know, kind of opening it up for PC now use.

704
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

705
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:24,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

706
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:25,922
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

707
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:28,123
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the whole PC use thing and that's, yeah.

708
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:36,507
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I wish I could have been convinced to buy a PlayStation 5 VR or PlayStation VR 2.

709
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:40,588
[SPEAKER_02]: These numbering, naming things get so weird, which is another problem probably.

710
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:46,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wish I could have been convinced to get a PlayStation VR 2, but I just, I didn't see that must have thing that I got to get.

711
00:58:46,551 --> 00:58:46,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

712
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:47,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

713
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, moving on.

714
00:58:50,953 --> 00:58:54,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, this is a... More lawsuits from Nintendo!

715
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a FAFO story, a fuck-around-find-out story, if you were wondering what that is.

716
00:58:58,336 --> 00:59:01,078
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a stupid story is what it is.

717
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:03,499
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just dumb things.

718
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:13,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently, there was this guy, Jesse Keenan, who likes to stream Nintendo Switch games before they were released.

719
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:41,810
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh you know basically quoting Captain America I can do this all day and then they um filed a lawsuit against him so he uh apparently was leaking Switch games including um Mario and Luigi Brothership uh using emulation and I'm assuming a pirated copy of said game because why else would you be using emulation to play the games early um

720
00:59:42,768 --> 01:00:07,005
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course you know they are saying that he is promoting piracy because he's probably pirating the games before they came out um and then uh yeah so now he is in a lawsuit and then still trolling the company saying you know love y'all capitalism is cancer my channel's being deleted for sharing gameplay videos this is your reward um

721
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:08,548
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

722
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:54,502
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's kind of on you yeah there's the Nintendo lawsuits that don't make sense and then there's like the one we were talking about and then there's the Nintendo lawsuit that you go yep that makes sense that's that's what we have here so like you know don't be so brazen with this stuff some people really think they're invincible some people really think they're invincible but um when it comes to Nintendo's legal team like fuck around and find out right

723
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:56,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of, yeah.

724
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:59,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe don't, like, I mean, what's the point?

725
01:00:59,946 --> 01:01:05,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what possible gains are you going to have from streaming that gameplay early?

726
01:01:05,448 --> 01:01:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, you may get some more views on your live streams and stuff like that, but are you really going to make up enough money to make that worth it?

727
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it just doesn't seem like it's a smart plan altogether.

728
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:20,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're probably not just coming for that damages, but they'll probably want to take any money that he has made.

729
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:26,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, they are $150,000 in damages for each instance of alleged copyright infringement.

730
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:37,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that he has, I guess, done this as many as 50 times in the last two years.

731
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:42,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, $7.5 million.

732
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:42,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

733
01:01:44,967 --> 01:02:04,809
[SPEAKER_02]: stick to emulating the games that are no longer available or just like if you want to play games early just do that on your own and not go hey guys look what I'm doing look at the crimes I'm committing you know like it's it's so stupid yeah it is very like TikTok of somebody committing a crime and that whole thing and wondering why they get in trouble yeah it's very that it's very that

734
01:02:05,632 --> 01:02:06,633
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

735
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:25,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Nvidia is going to be adding a playtime cap to GeForce Now.

736
01:02:25,673 --> 01:02:29,274
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be starting next year, so starting January 1st, 2025.

737
01:02:29,714 --> 01:02:38,297
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a new GeForce Now subscriber, you will only be able to play for up to 100 hours every month before you have to pay for additional playtime.

738
01:02:38,897 --> 01:02:44,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But in thinking in Jamie's case here, you know, she's been pretty active on this and I know she streams using this service.

739
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a supporter of cloud-based streaming back when it was Google Stadia, right?

740
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:56,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you signed up before December 31st, 2024, you won't see your usage capped until 2026, right?

741
01:02:57,884 --> 01:02:58,424
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

742
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,019
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, well, the average person uses this.

743
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turns out, you know, 100 hours, if you divide that up amongst 30 days in a month, it's a little over, what, three hours a day?

744
01:03:26,242 --> 01:03:27,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Which sounds like a lot, yes.

745
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:33,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking, like, in Jamie's case, she does, like, five or six hour streams a couple times a week, right?

746
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, she might get there.

747
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:38,628
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, again, I can't speak for her because she's not here tonight to give her opinion.

748
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll ask her about it next week.

749
01:03:39,689 --> 01:03:42,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure it's just one of those things where it's like,

750
01:03:44,378 --> 01:03:52,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like people are not raving about this service and this little PR stunt is not going to do it any favors.

751
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:58,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if when you talk about capping the hours, but if you sign up by the end of the year, you'll get a whole other year free.

752
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:02,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's going to drive subscribership the way you think it's going to.

753
01:04:02,628 --> 01:04:18,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what's great about this, too, is the fact that, you know, cutting the stream time down or whatever like this, how much money is that really going to save for the most profitable company in the world?

754
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:26,342
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, they've beaten Intel as, you know, one of the biggest, you know, hardware companies out there, like...

755
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you're not doing bad at all.

756
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:30,942
[SPEAKER_05]: You have tons of money.

757
01:04:31,402 --> 01:04:35,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's no reason that these should be implemented this way.

758
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:41,268
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I guess it's a cost cutting measure because infinite profits got to keep those shareholders happy.

759
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:44,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep boosting that stock because their stock is so high already.

760
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:53,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to be in the interest of fairness and covering all sides, I will say for NVIDIA, there are some other changes, and maybe some of these would be welcomed.

761
01:04:53,647 --> 01:05:00,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So the priority tier is getting renamed, and now it's called Performance, and it will now stream at 1440 pixels as opposed to 1080p.

762
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:25,802
[SPEAKER_02]: so it is going to be an upgrade in the visual quality of it so there is that and if you're already paying for what's called priority you are getting moved to this performance tier and now I guess there's going to be an ultimate on top of that so ultimate is going to be 4k and 120 frames per second and I think that's what like I don't know how much that costs oh $19.99 a month

763
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:33,646
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of internet connection do you need for 240 frames per second in 4K?

764
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:35,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised.

765
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:37,088
[SPEAKER_02]: My fibers could.

766
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:41,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I could get that many frames, but I can get 4K YouTubes easy.

767
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:42,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.

768
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:43,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And they look really good.

769
01:05:43,854 --> 01:05:44,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right.

770
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:47,516
[SPEAKER_05]: 4K YouTube, I understand, but I don't know.

771
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

772
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:53,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's pie-in-the-sky nonsense.

773
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:53,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

774
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's getting faster and faster because I remember when we moved in here, they were like, do you want the one gigabit fiber?

775
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We have up to five gigabit fiber in your area.

776
01:06:01,831 --> 01:06:03,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you probably don't need that much.

777
01:06:03,312 --> 01:06:07,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have the one gigabit, and it is more than perfect for us.

778
01:06:07,675 --> 01:06:11,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so much better than what we had with Comcast.

779
01:06:11,878 --> 01:06:15,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone down one time in the two years we've lived here, and it was down for maybe an hour and a half.

780
01:06:16,446 --> 01:06:17,728
[SPEAKER_02]: and Constance.

781
01:06:17,768 --> 01:06:17,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

782
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

783
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:21,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm rubbing it in, but I'm just to all the people out there.

784
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:22,195
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets better.

785
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait for other companies to offer fiber in your area.

786
01:06:27,145 --> 01:06:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets better.

787
01:06:27,825 --> 01:06:28,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

788
01:06:28,286 --> 01:06:32,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just waiting with bated breath for, like, my monopoly to be broken.

789
01:06:32,507 --> 01:06:33,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure that's going to happen.

790
01:06:33,988 --> 01:06:34,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

791
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: We voted against that.

792
01:06:35,749 --> 01:06:36,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Comcast and we have AT&T.

793
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:40,450
[SPEAKER_05]: AT&T is like, we're high speed.

794
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:41,211
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

795
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:44,072
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't use high speed anymore because it's illegal for them to use that.

796
01:06:44,392 --> 01:06:45,032
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.

797
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:46,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

798
01:06:46,093 --> 01:06:48,294
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the terminology that they use?

799
01:06:48,374 --> 01:06:49,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultra fast, I think.

800
01:06:49,966 --> 01:06:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like ultra-fast internet.

801
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:52,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, shut up.

802
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:54,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, come on.

803
01:06:54,968 --> 01:06:59,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, 60 megabits down is not ultra-fast, my guy.

804
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:05,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, AT&T is the company we use, but yeah, it's fiber.

805
01:07:05,371 --> 01:07:06,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one gig up, one gig down.

806
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:08,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's, yeah, very fast.

807
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:09,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

808
01:07:10,356 --> 01:07:19,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice, remember, for those that have been listening to OLR for a very long time, the only time technology issues have shut down the show was power-related.

809
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:21,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not internet-related.

810
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet issues have never shut down the show.

811
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And power, honestly, it's been pretty good.

812
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:28,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

813
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because we're currently on PG&E, or at least...

814
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it seems like it's always someone running into a telephone pole or wind.

815
01:07:37,784 --> 01:07:38,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wind.

816
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not here, because it's all underground.

817
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:48,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, our neighborhood is, but everywhere around our neighborhood is not, so...

818
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:53,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we'll check in with Jamie on her thoughts on the NVIDIA issue next week.

819
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:59,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, at least the quality is going to get better, but I'm curious if that's really good enough for that play cap.

820
01:07:59,844 --> 01:08:05,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you can pay, I think it was like $3 for an additional 10 hours, but that's going to add up pretty quick.

821
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:08,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, we'll see.

822
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:11,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, meanwhile, Loki, let's see what's going on in your neck of the woods with our next headline.

823
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:29,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of quality, the Chief Operations Officer who oversees Sony PlayStation Business has made some comments during their earnings call talking about what's happened with Concord, for example.

824
01:08:29,263 --> 01:08:34,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've promised that there's going to be some better quality checks after Concord.

825
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:36,025
[SPEAKER_05]: TheFailureOfConcord.

826
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:49,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently we're still in the process of learning and basically with that regards to IP you don't know the result until you actually try it or maybe listen to your fans beforehand when they said it looks awful and don't release it like this and you're like nope full speed ahead.

827
01:08:50,476 --> 01:09:00,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us our reflection probably will need to have a lot of gates including user testing and user evaluation and timings of such gates to we need to bring them forward and

828
01:09:00,943 --> 01:09:29,072
[SPEAKER_05]: we should have done those much earlier on so in other words basically like more frequent tests and you know pivot early instead of going all in and all that stuff going forward our first party titles and third party titles we do have many different windows so we want to be able to select right an optimal window we can deploy to our own platform without cannibalization so we can maximize performance and teams of the title launches um

829
01:09:31,075 --> 01:09:36,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know if they're going to continue to make these types of mistakes.

830
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see them doing that.

831
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:46,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I also feel that this wasn't like unknown that Concord was going to flop.

832
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:50,671
[SPEAKER_02]: This statement really is like this statement really reeks of trust me, bro.

833
01:09:52,072 --> 01:09:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't it's like I feel like I mean, bro.

834
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:57,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what are you supposed to tell the investors?

835
01:09:57,828 --> 01:09:58,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we fucked up.

836
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We really didn't know what we were releasing.

837
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We trusted them and they didn't do it.

838
01:10:05,192 --> 01:10:15,078
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt in chat says, Oh please, the teams were warning them and probably telling them don't release this but your board pushed us out.

839
01:10:15,098 --> 01:10:15,078
100%.

840
01:10:15,138 --> 01:10:18,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So who on the board is being let go to really demonstrate?

841
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Does action speak louder than words?

842
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,550
[SPEAKER_05]: who on the board?

843
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:44,501
[SPEAKER_05]: nobody, just the team at Firework how dare they release a game in this state that we totally knew that we knew and they told us we take the lessons learned from Concord and will continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area stop it stop

844
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you need to do.

845
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:55,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Live service, you know, whenever we hear you talking about, like, expanding your live service, we hear, we're greedy motherfuckers and we want more of that fucking money is what we hear.

846
01:10:55,604 --> 01:10:57,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

847
01:10:57,205 --> 01:10:57,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.

848
01:10:57,766 --> 01:10:57,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.

849
01:10:59,358 --> 01:11:08,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, moving on to a game that is coming out, I think it's next week, we're getting a pretty fun release with Dragon Quest III, the HD 2D remake.

850
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:15,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting a re-release of Dragon Quest III, I think for the second time, because I think we've already seen a remake of this game once.

851
01:11:16,407 --> 01:11:23,911
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're getting another one that's going to be more in the engine that brought us things like Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy and all that stuff.

852
01:11:24,131 --> 01:11:24,892
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

853
01:11:43,686 --> 01:11:51,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But Square Enix is saying we want spoiler warnings for any major plot details, which is wild because how old is Dragon Quest 3?

854
01:11:51,552 --> 01:11:52,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very old game.

855
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:53,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people know where it's going.

856
01:11:54,054 --> 01:12:02,461
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you are not allowed to share the ending or the end post-ending until after the 13th of December.

857
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:03,442
[SPEAKER_02]: In a quote...

858
01:12:03,942 --> 01:12:13,628
[SPEAKER_02]: When streaming scenes that are closely related to the game scenario, please voluntarily label them as contained spoilers so as to not spoil the enjoyment for those who are about to play the game.

859
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:21,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Please refrain from live streaming the ending and post-ending gameplay following the final battle until December 13th.

860
01:12:21,453 --> 01:12:23,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Please refrain from posting videos or image.

861
01:12:24,395 --> 01:12:26,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing about Dragon Quest III.

862
01:12:26,636 --> 01:12:27,757
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a post-game.

863
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:39,128
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can go look up the ending to the original game right now and you'll see in like most RPGs of its era, you beat the boss, you get some nice little graphical credits, the end.

864
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoilers!

865
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, screen is kind of showing something there.

866
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:45,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I think it is.

867
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:47,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest 3 HD Remake

868
01:13:13,115 --> 01:13:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: and this was years ago this is two or three years ago so it's kind of like when the HD thing was announced it was like finally so my guess is at the end of all this is a trailer for either the Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D remake possible but we already know that's coming or and I think this is the real possibility and what for whatever reason they want to keep under wraps Dragon Quest 12

869
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:40,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I think because we where's the information on Dragon Quest 12?

870
01:13:41,099 --> 01:13:43,262
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't heard anything on this in a very long time.

871
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:51,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So my guess is there is a Dragon Quest 12 trailer hint something at the end of all this that you get us a reward for beating the game.

872
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:55,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they think it's not going to release to the Internet.

873
01:13:56,778 --> 01:13:57,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, honey.

874
01:13:58,459 --> 01:14:02,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh honey, that is going to get ripped from the files.

875
01:14:02,582 --> 01:14:08,406
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be on social media sites that are a lot harder to scrape and content match and all that.

876
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,487
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be up there on day one.

877
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:15,331
[SPEAKER_01]: But nice try.

878
01:14:17,012 --> 01:14:17,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

879
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:31,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I can respect the whole don't rip the trailer and put it on your own social media for the bait because we plan to put it on our own social media on December 13th and we want the clicks.

880
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:33,156
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this says to me.

881
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:34,616
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get the clicks.

882
01:14:34,796 --> 01:14:35,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the clicks.

883
01:14:36,456 --> 01:14:42,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very careful if you do this though, especially on YouTube because Square Enix will look for it and shut it down.

884
01:14:42,137 --> 01:14:43,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee it.

885
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:49,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, since we're talking about classic games, I think this is a good transition into our next segment.

886
01:15:00,225 --> 01:15:07,539
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

887
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,544
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

888
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:17,764
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, DarkSakura is not able to dive into the gaming vault tonight because she is not here.

889
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:23,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked Loki to decide what should the classic game of the week be this week.

890
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So Loki, what is the classic game of the week?

891
01:15:27,132 --> 01:15:30,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic game of the week is Excite Truck.

892
01:15:31,076 --> 01:15:32,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking there's no way.

893
01:15:32,477 --> 01:15:34,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You loved this fucking game.

894
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:36,301
[SPEAKER_02]: You love this fucking game.

895
01:15:37,464 --> 01:15:38,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Our family loved this fucking game.

896
01:15:38,925 --> 01:15:40,146
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife loved this fucking game.

897
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:40,407
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

898
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:43,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a toss-up.

899
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:46,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I was almost considering Grand Theft Auto V, but I was like, nah.

900
01:15:47,205 --> 01:15:48,566
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Excite Truck.

901
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:49,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Truck.

902
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Truck.

903
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:50,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Truck.

904
01:15:52,108 --> 01:16:01,273
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best games, I think, in my opinion, on the Nintendo Wii, it was the third game in the Excite series.

905
01:16:01,313 --> 01:16:03,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you know, starting off with Excite Bike.

906
01:16:03,354 --> 01:16:05,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we had Excite Bike 64.

907
01:16:06,516 --> 01:16:09,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, now Excite Truck, which was just awesome.

908
01:16:10,038 --> 01:16:13,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a unique control scheme that used the Wii remote.

909
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were never any sequels to it at the end.

910
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:47,056
[SPEAKER_05]: there was, we can talk about that we have to, okay some cool features though that weren't really in a lot of Wii games either because you may remember that Wii had an SD card slot and you could actually pop in an SD card with MP3s on there and replace the music in the game with your own music that's right, and it was awesome it was so cool you could put stuff from like Initial D and Wangan and shit in this game

911
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:50,194
[SPEAKER_05]: and DDR Music.

912
01:16:51,002 --> 01:16:51,722
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

913
01:16:51,922 --> 01:16:53,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very cool.

914
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:57,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so it's not an easy game either.

915
01:16:57,484 --> 01:17:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to race through the different tracks trying to get a high ranking, essentially.

916
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:16,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way you do that is based off of the number of tricks you do, also the stunts, how fast you've completed the race, that type of stuff.

917
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:17,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And getting...

918
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:42,415
[SPEAKER_05]: S rank on all of the all of the difficulties basically unlocks harder difficulties where the AI is even harder so they have you know excite race which you get S's in that and then there's also super excite race which is even harder and then of course much like Mario Kart and all the other stuff mirror mode which mirrors the tracks and

919
01:17:43,559 --> 01:18:09,533
[SPEAKER_05]: also the rings that you have to pass through are smaller as well so it gets even harder then on top of that they also had challenge mode which allowed you to race through different gates rings and they have crush challenges and then super challenge which is an even harder version of that and then of course you know multiplayer versus you could play two players in that as well um

920
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:19,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the cool stuff, you know, they had, you know, some of the same physics, I guess, as our gameplay, the Excitebike stuff.

921
01:18:19,156 --> 01:18:26,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So your car, you know, you have like a boost and then your car could overheat, but water would cool that down as well as jumping really high into the air.

922
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that caused the air to actually cool down your car.

923
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:32,302
[SPEAKER_05]: They had these different...

924
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:59,499
[SPEAKER_05]: basically icons or power-ups that you'd run over the map that would change the landscape so you'd have like all sorts of things happen like tornadoes would spawn in or trains or like a volcano would go off the land would just shift underneath you it was really cool and it could open up some different like shortcuts and like jumps and stuff like that but yeah really really awesome game

925
01:19:01,155 --> 01:19:06,397
[SPEAKER_05]: They did release a sequel, ExciteBots Trick Racing.

926
01:19:07,397 --> 01:19:14,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of lost, they lost the spark of what made ExciteTruck good.

927
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, why the fuck was it ExciteBots in the first place?

928
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:21,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't follow up ExciteBike and ExciteTruck with ExciteRobots.

929
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:22,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think we're all obsessed?

930
01:19:22,323 --> 01:19:26,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it should have been ExciteCar, ExciteBoats, ExciteYacht.

931
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:29,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Excite Covered Wagon

932
01:19:38,413 --> 01:19:41,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if they're still around anymore, if they're still making games.

933
01:19:41,816 --> 01:19:44,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's been a while, 2009.

934
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,642
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, no, they're still working on games.

935
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:50,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So they just did World of Outlaws Dirt Racing, which was back on 2022.

936
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so they're still making racing games.

937
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:58,174
[SPEAKER_05]: They also did, crazy enough, the port of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D for the 3DS.

938
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:00,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very random.

939
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they do a lot of ports of different things.

940
01:20:02,937 --> 01:20:04,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Donkey Kong Country Returns, huh?

941
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:05,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

942
01:20:05,898 --> 01:20:07,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But they haven't done a game since 2022, huh?

943
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:10,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they haven't done a game since 2022.

944
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:11,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

945
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:16,144
[SPEAKER_02]: They were acquired by iRacing.com that year.

946
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:18,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Out the window of any future Nintendo games.

947
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:19,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.

948
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:20,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see it in the same boat.

949
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:47,917
[SPEAKER_05]: but I mean, Nintendo could do it I'm sure someone in-house could create a new Excite Truck game since they own the IP for it they did such a good job with this though or at the very least, please Nintendo just backwards compatible port that to the Switch or something it would be fantastic it really would but it's not to be but yep, Excite Truck one of the best games on the Wii

950
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:49,365
[SPEAKER_05]: My opinion.

951
01:20:49,665 --> 01:20:50,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And a launch title at that.

952
01:20:51,486 --> 01:20:52,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And a launch title.

953
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:53,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

954
01:20:53,528 --> 01:20:56,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, the Wii had such a good launch, if you think about it.

955
01:20:56,970 --> 01:21:04,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they sold a million of them, or millions and millions of them, but didn't it have like 18 games at launch?

956
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:05,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a lot of games at launch.

957
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot.

958
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:07,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I think...

959
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:12,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, of course, Wii Sports, which pack in already.

960
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember getting Trauma Center early on.

961
01:21:14,651 --> 01:21:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Trauma Center game.

962
01:21:15,772 --> 01:21:17,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Trauma Center, Excite Truck.

963
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:23,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say there was Twilight Princess, which is big.

964
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:28,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I don't know if Red Steel was right away.

965
01:21:28,424 --> 01:21:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That might have been like a December game.

966
01:21:30,646 --> 01:21:32,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But Red Steel is pretty close.

967
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:33,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Rabbids.

968
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:34,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had this.

969
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:35,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

970
01:21:39,383 --> 01:21:40,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to figure this out here.

971
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:43,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, when were these released?

972
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:44,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, okay.

973
01:21:49,222 --> 01:21:55,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking at a chart of like every single Wii game that ever came out, but there was a lot of stuff that never came out in the U.S.

974
01:21:55,507 --> 01:21:56,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

975
01:21:56,428 --> 01:22:12,941
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an Avatar game, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenka Hashi 2, Excite Truck, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, GT Pro Series, Happy Feet, Zelda Twilight Princess, Madden 07, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

976
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:13,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot about that.

977
01:22:14,342 --> 01:22:30,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster 4x4, World Circuit, Need for Speed, Carbon, Rampage, Total Destruction, Rayman, Raving Rabbids, Red Steel, SpongeBob, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball, Banana Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center, Second Opinion, and Wii Sports.

978
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,132
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those, November 19th, 2006.

979
01:22:34,353 --> 01:22:34,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

980
01:22:34,934 --> 01:22:37,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that I looked at the screenshot here.

981
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:40,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, stars, you had to collect the number of stars in order to get a certain rank.

982
01:22:41,002 --> 01:22:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you get, you know, based on your placement and then smashing the cars and stuff like that, which the smashing the cars, it's almost like a burnout in a sense, the way you do that, but...

983
01:22:52,436 --> 01:23:07,514
[SPEAKER_05]: um yeah it was great game and it only enhanced by um you know putting your own music because the soundtrack was all right but your own music so much better like you know racing to pendulum and you

984
01:23:08,314 --> 01:23:13,276
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife used to listen to a lot of Justin Timberlake.

985
01:23:13,877 --> 01:23:15,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, amazing.

986
01:23:15,617 --> 01:23:16,198
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

987
01:23:16,318 --> 01:23:16,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

988
01:23:17,038 --> 01:23:22,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know, by the way, since I'm looking at the list, do you know what the last game ever released for the Wii was and when?

989
01:23:23,361 --> 01:23:25,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess when the last Wii game came out.

990
01:23:25,822 --> 01:23:27,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't cheat.

991
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:31,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Just Dance and it's probably like 20...

992
01:23:36,114 --> 01:23:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020, maybe?

993
01:23:37,376 --> 01:23:37,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at you.

994
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:38,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be looking at a list.

995
01:23:39,018 --> 01:23:39,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, you're right.

996
01:23:39,758 --> 01:23:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

997
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just guessing.

998
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,120
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

999
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:46,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Dance 2020, released in 2019, was the last Wii release.

1000
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:47,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Hawaii Shakedown.

1001
01:23:47,908 --> 01:23:50,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, that's technically a digital game, but yeah.

1002
01:23:51,312 --> 01:23:53,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, yeah, I should have said retail release.

1003
01:23:53,092 --> 01:23:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Just Dance, 2017, 18, 19, and 20 were all on the Wii.

1004
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, they started drying up in about 2015.

1005
01:24:00,314 --> 01:24:02,434
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a handful of others.

1006
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:05,495
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like a Barbie game and a Monster High game in 2015.

1007
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1008
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DarkSakura says, I think we covered the last Just Dance.

1009
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we did, but you know.

1010
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:17,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that all seem like a lifetime ago at this point?

1011
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:19,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does.

1012
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:25,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week, Excite Truck.

1013
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm rearranging screens here as I'm talking.

1014
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:33,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on and talk about some other headlines going on in the world.

1015
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:36,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So Loki, let's do some rapid fire news here.

1016
01:24:37,267 --> 01:24:44,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Sega is delisting 60 games across console and PC digital storefronts next month.

1017
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are all retro games.

1018
01:24:46,992 --> 01:24:52,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of your Sega Genesis collection games, I think, are being delisted.

1019
01:24:53,016 --> 01:24:56,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if they're just like releasing a new pack or something like that with these or something.

1020
01:24:57,818 --> 01:25:21,134
[SPEAKER_05]: um but yeah it's a lot of these are being delisted i probably have them all in my steam library right now obviously you will be able to play them if you have them already in your libraries but you will not be able to purchase them again although at this point like just i don't know i'm sure you could buy a new collection when it comes out collections that are probably available used yeah

1021
01:25:22,236 --> 01:25:44,366
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so um and then this is really awesome uh so awesome games done quick is returning back again of course in January and one of the um highlights that they've mentioned so far is a crazy taxi speed run but they're gonna be backed by a live cover band of the offspring playing the music of the game

1022
01:25:45,626 --> 01:26:12,353
[SPEAKER_02]: that just sounds amazing it's genius because they can't they don't want to get even though I think getting shut down for copyright would be really shitty when it's a charity event I also understand a lot of that matching is automated so there's probably some legit concerns about you know automated copyright matching shutting it down I think it's genius to use the cover band to do it and it's gonna be a lot of fun too especially when you consider you know they're back in person they have been for a bit it's a live event and it has to be a lot of fun to be at

1023
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:16,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's supposed to run from January 5th to January 12th.

1024
01:26:17,735 --> 01:26:22,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, they've got a full list of the games so far.

1025
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:30,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious to see if there's any other really big ones that would be interesting.

1026
01:26:33,249 --> 01:26:34,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, Excite Truck...

1027
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:45,006
[SPEAKER_02]: and we do not know if the hosting because our own Bobby Blackwolf here at VOG Network we don't know the status of that yet because the hosting I don't think has been selected yet.

1028
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:48,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Several for Nintendo World Championships NES edition.

1029
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

1030
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:54,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because they did one of those during the Hurricane run that I was watching so that'll be interesting to watch.

1031
01:26:55,015 --> 01:27:02,621
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to do some PS1 Mystery Versus tournaments so there's going to be some of those.

1032
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:04,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1033
01:27:05,999 --> 01:27:25,415
[SPEAKER_05]: there's going to be a person playing Elden Ring with a saxophone controller that's amazing that is awesome yeah I mean I don't know lots of really interesting games so I'm looking I can't wait to see what comes out of that it's always a good time alright

1034
01:27:26,584 --> 01:27:29,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on to news out of the Switch.

1035
01:27:51,844 --> 01:27:56,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And as part of, you know, you can pre-order the digital version and the physical edition of Stray.

1036
01:27:57,448 --> 01:28:07,614
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a PDF that Annapurna has put up online that you can print out your own cover for the game, replacing the cat's face with your own cat.

1037
01:28:08,194 --> 01:28:11,375
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little silly because it's just a PDF of the box art with that.

1038
01:28:11,436 --> 01:28:21,520
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I think it's a clever idea to get people to post their own cats in that and drive a little hype for the game before it releases on November 19th, 2024 for $40.

1039
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:28,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even though that's already been out on the PlayStation 5 for a bit, I think that'll be a Christmas gift for some kids.

1040
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:31,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one's going to sell a little bit.

1041
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:33,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one to keep an eye on for sure.

1042
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:40,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since we know it's getting to be that time of year, I don't think we're getting to the big, big release date yet.

1043
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be in two weeks, but we still have a lot this week as we travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1044
01:28:45,326 --> 01:28:45,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Loki?

1045
01:28:46,772 --> 01:28:48,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of quiet this week.

1046
01:28:48,852 --> 01:28:55,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really packed, but yeah, I mean, it kind of dies down by Black Friday, sort of.

1047
01:28:55,514 --> 01:28:55,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's true.

1048
01:28:56,854 --> 01:29:03,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got this week Backpack Hero on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

[SPEAKER_02]: Sika Game Special Edition is being released for the Switch as well and I think that might be it you don't usually put stuff up against a Dragon Quest game even if it is a remake so it's surprising there's even a little bit there but on the PlayStation 5 we also have some things to talk about there for Japan including Farming Simulator 25 hell yeah that is out in Japan this week

1068
01:30:44,342 --> 01:30:48,604

[SPEAKER_02]: Finally out this week in Japan.

1078
01:31:10,913 --> 01:31:13,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought for sure they already had Minecraft on PS5.

1079
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:14,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is the first time.

1080

1081
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be the first retail release.

1082
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:17,757
[SPEAKER_05]: They did.

1083
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:23,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just realized I'm going to have to re-read the releases because I was looking up the wrong month.

1084
01:31:25,111 --> 01:31:26,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Jamie do that last week?

1085

1087
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:31,729

1088

[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1116
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:24,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we have a few more headlines for you and then we'll get to the listener roundtable.

1117
01:34:24,128 --> 01:34:34,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have at least one email tonight so we'll get to that and maybe actually we have some blue sky posts too so we'll get to all those in just a moment here but first, Loki with our next last headline.

1118
01:34:35,299 --> 01:34:46,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so fans of Overwatch are suspecting that Blizzard's about to announce a classic Overwatch announcement.

1119
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:54,295
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a trailer that is premiering in 13 hours tomorrow at 9 a.m., November 11th.

1120
01:34:56,277 --> 01:35:23,930
[SPEAKER_05]: at least Pacific Time and apparently in that the thumbnail right now is Tracer in her original classic Overwatch outfit and so the thought being you know that since they were testing 6v6 originally not that long ago and now this are they going to be announcing classic Overwatch like they did classic WoW to try to like

1121
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:34,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Have their cake and eat it too, I guess, as far as what people wanted in Overwatch and what they changed and what people didn't like and all that stuff.

1122
01:35:34,466 --> 01:35:34,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1123
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:39,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting, especially that all of this seems to be happening after the Microsoft change.

1124
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:44,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm reading into the tea leaves too much to that, but that could be interesting.

1125
01:35:44,533 --> 01:35:44,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1126
01:35:45,533 --> 01:35:45,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

1127
01:35:46,734 --> 01:35:46,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1128
01:36:04,632 --> 01:36:25,237
[SPEAKER_02]: and last on our list of stories for tonight a Mass Effect TV show is in the works you might have missed it around all the other crap going on this week but N7 day happened November the 7th right and that's a big day for Mass Effect and you know BioWare had come out in advance and said don't expect anything major okay basically saying don't expect a new trailer all right

1129
01:36:25,737 --> 01:36:26,377
[SPEAKER_02]: N7 Inspired Armor Dragon Age

1130
01:36:50,649 --> 01:36:51,669
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1131
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:11,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Casey has worked on screenplays for such hits as F9, The Fast Saga.

1132
01:37:12,086 --> 01:37:18,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He also did rewrites for 10 Cloverfield Lane and a sci-fi film called Kin.

1133
01:37:19,413 --> 01:37:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So that news, of course, all came out on N7 Day.

1134
01:37:23,317 --> 01:37:26,320
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's one of those I'll believe it when I see it type of things.

1135
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:29,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's remember, Amazon did a pretty decent job with Fallout.

1136
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:32,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it was very well received.

1137
01:37:32,406 --> 01:37:42,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, of course, you know, just like we saw happen with Netflix and when some of their things were successful, like The Witcher, we're seeing things that are more greenlit around the universe, so to speak.

1138
01:37:42,533 --> 01:37:43,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be interesting to see what happens.

1139
01:37:45,936 --> 01:37:50,439
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat asks, will the Mass Effect series feature a male or female Shepard?

1140
01:37:50,799 --> 01:37:51,920
[SPEAKER_02]: God willing, neither.

1141
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my hope, is that, you know.

1142
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:55,362
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be an actual German Shepard.

1143
01:37:55,523 --> 01:37:55,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1144
01:37:59,501 --> 01:38:02,005
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what gamers are not fucking ready for?

1145
01:38:02,305 --> 01:38:04,208
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what gamers are not fucking ready for?

1146
01:38:04,268 --> 01:38:04,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean it.

1147
01:38:05,429 --> 01:38:05,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it.

1148
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:07,438
[SPEAKER_02]: NonBinaryShepherd.

1149
01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:16,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I want NonBinaryShepherd because I just want gamers to fucking implode going, this show's too woke before they've even fucking seen 60 seconds of it.

1150
01:38:16,506 --> 01:38:21,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my wish for you gamers of America and specifically America.

1151
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:30,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, I say this as somebody using he, him, they pronouns and I really would love to see NonBinaryShepherd.

1152
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: That aside...

1153
01:38:32,085 --> 01:38:33,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't think it should have Shepard at all.

1154
01:38:35,848 --> 01:38:41,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect is a huge universe, pun, but there are so many other stories they could do.

1155
01:38:42,014 --> 01:38:45,497
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do side stories talking about some of the other conflicts that happen in the universe.

1156
01:38:45,877 --> 01:38:51,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have other cases of people coming across the Reapers, joining at the Citadel, things like that.

1157
01:38:52,643 --> 01:38:56,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really like to see the Mass Effect TV series tell a different story in the universe.

1158
01:38:57,007 --> 01:38:59,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're not able to do it, then I would like to see them do FemShep.

1159
01:39:01,172 --> 01:39:01,893
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

1160
01:39:12,543 --> 01:39:12,723
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1161
01:39:13,043 --> 01:39:18,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tiger Class says it could be about a new team and Shepard could be mentioned as this figure that exists out there.

1162
01:39:18,188 --> 01:39:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1163
01:39:19,729 --> 01:39:21,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a couple other things to consider.

1164
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:30,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, Andromeda, whatever you feel about that game, was able to tell another story in the Mass Effect universe that really didn't involve Shepard.

1165
01:39:30,898 --> 01:39:32,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, there were...

1166
01:39:32,819 --> 01:39:53,496
[SPEAKER_02]: you know but for them for the by and large it was a story that didn't need to involve Shepard I'm not saying that if they want to retell Andromeda I don't care I don't think people are as emotionally attached to that game as they were the main trilogy but again I don't think they should retread that old ground I really don't um and um yeah maybe this is yeah and

1167
01:39:54,631 --> 01:39:56,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they just don't mention Shepard at all.

1168
01:39:56,952 --> 01:39:57,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it.

1169
01:39:57,472 --> 01:40:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Shepard could be a figure that's out there that they hear about and that the gender is never confirmed one way or the other, and I don't think it needs to be.

1170
01:40:05,014 --> 01:40:05,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

1171
01:40:05,434 --> 01:40:08,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Shepard is something people talk about, someone people talk about, and then that's it.

1172
01:40:10,695 --> 01:40:18,437
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing to consider, though, is that by the time this TV show actually comes out, we'll be talking about a new game.

1173
01:40:19,338 --> 01:40:20,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So what if...

1174
01:40:21,124 --> 01:40:49,046
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the TV show is going to be a bridge between the first trilogy and the new game I almost said second trilogy maybe I'm being a little bit you know but you know whatever is next for Mass Effect what if the TV show serves as a bridge between that because we've seen that sort of thing before with movies right don't we have like Star Wars shows that are set between movie timelines right in that thing I don't know yeah yeah and or so it'll be interesting we'll see

1175
01:40:50,305 --> 01:40:50,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll watch it.

1176
01:40:50,907 --> 01:40:51,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I will.

1177
01:40:51,951 --> 01:40:52,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it a shot.

1178
01:40:53,459 --> 01:40:55,140
[SPEAKER_02]: My expectations aren't high, but I'll give it a shot.

1179
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,260
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into the listener roundtable tonight.

1180
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We invite your participation every week here on the show.

1182
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:07,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, we have some emails tonight, which is pretty cool.

1183
01:41:08,504 --> 01:41:11,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, Dark Tetsuya mentions the Quantum Leap reboot was the thing that happened.

1184
01:41:11,865 --> 01:41:17,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about a famous non-binary actor in Sandman.

1185
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:21,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Mishkin brought up that there was a character in Sandman who was non-binary.

1186
01:41:21,507 --> 01:41:21,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.

1187
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,569
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1188
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:44,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the emails.

1189
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

1190
01:41:48,082 --> 01:41:49,663
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two emails tonight, believe it or not.

1191
01:41:49,964 --> 01:41:54,326
[SPEAKER_02]: The first email tonight comes from Fabrice from Belgium, who we haven't heard from in a while.

1192
01:41:54,666 --> 01:41:55,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to hear from you, Fabrice.

1193
01:41:55,747 --> 01:41:56,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.

1194
01:41:56,767 --> 01:41:57,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, OLR.

1195
01:41:57,848 --> 01:42:00,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I mailed you, but now I finally come around to it.

1196
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:07,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently bought a mini PC with 11,000 games on it for over 60 consoles and platforms.

1197
01:42:08,214 --> 01:42:09,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1198
01:42:32,282 --> 01:42:37,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, my wife and I are super into playing pinball because a real pinball table is way too expensive to buy.

1199
01:42:37,464 --> 01:42:38,624
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other priorities at the moment.

1200
01:42:38,904 --> 01:42:40,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about buying a digital pinball table.

1201
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: No one doesn't come close to the real thing, but I think it's a good way to get to know the rules and so forth of a pinball table.

1202
01:42:46,067 --> 01:42:49,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Another plus is that you can have a lot of games and only one table.

1203
01:42:49,768 --> 01:42:51,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Our favorite at the moment is Iron Maiden.

1204
01:42:51,989 --> 01:42:52,889
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts about this?

1205
01:42:53,469 --> 01:42:55,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank you guys again for doing the podcast every week.

1206
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:59,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about the things I've done while listening to you guys, it's quite a list.

1207
01:42:59,571 --> 01:43:00,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, Fabrice.

1208
01:43:00,512 --> 01:43:01,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate the email.

1209
01:43:01,653 --> 01:43:04,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, do you have a couch that I could sleep on for the next four years?

1210
01:43:05,797 --> 01:43:06,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wondering.

1211
01:43:07,178 --> 01:43:07,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Over there in Belgium?

1212
01:43:08,879 --> 01:43:10,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like a place that has its shit together.

1213
01:43:11,061 --> 01:43:11,322
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1214
01:43:11,362 --> 01:43:13,063
[SPEAKER_02]: In all seriousness, I'm not leaving.

1215
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:13,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going anywhere.

1216
01:43:15,285 --> 01:43:16,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's address the two parts of this.

1217
01:43:16,606 --> 01:43:19,009
[SPEAKER_02]: The first part is about the retro gaming system.

1218
01:43:19,449 --> 01:43:20,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you bring up a good point.

1219
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:23,393
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people love to have a giant...

1220
01:43:24,292 --> 01:43:25,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1221
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:48,462
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's a lot of fun to be able to revisit those things.

1222
01:43:48,842 --> 01:43:57,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, yeah, for most people it is that retro itch, but if you really spend some time going in depth, you might find some real good gems from back in the day.

1223
01:43:58,050 --> 01:43:59,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely look up The Guardian Legend.

1224
01:44:00,712 --> 01:44:01,412
[SPEAKER_02]: on the NES.

1225
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:02,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend some time with that.

1226
01:44:03,633 --> 01:44:09,916
[SPEAKER_02]: A game that came up recently I was talking about at the party I talked about earlier in the show, Dragon 2 Dragon's View.

1227
01:44:10,276 --> 01:44:11,937
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a game I really want to go back and play again.

1228
01:44:11,977 --> 01:44:13,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an underrated game too.

1229
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:14,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Actraiser.

1230
01:44:14,718 --> 01:44:20,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure all of us can name these retro classics we love, but try to really play them for a little while.

1231
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really amazing...

1232
01:44:22,441 --> 01:44:51,263
[SPEAKER_02]: great games that really show you like again and sometimes you might play a retro game like I mentioned earlier in the show Donkey Kong on the Atari 2600 you play it now and it's like wow this really kind of looks like barf compared to the arcade game but then you kind of go well but considering the size and the hardware they had to work with they really did a decent job trying to get that feeling making you feel like and that same kind of dopamine hit of playing the arcade game without necessarily being pixel for pixel perfect

1233
01:44:51,883 --> 01:44:52,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I get the idea, like

1234
01:45:10,051 --> 01:45:12,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a large collection of ROMs and stuff like that.

1235
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:17,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fun to just throw them all onto a PC and then never play them.

1236
01:45:18,217 --> 01:45:19,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I do my Steam collection.

1237
01:45:20,199 --> 01:45:20,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, that's right.

1238
01:45:21,159 --> 01:45:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.

1239
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:25,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have a backlog of retro games, but your Steam backlog is more embarrassing.

1240
01:45:26,663 --> 01:45:27,964
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my advice to Fabrice.

1241
01:45:28,144 --> 01:45:33,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabrice, I guarantee your Steam backlog is more embarrassing than your retro backlog.

1242
01:45:33,707 --> 01:45:39,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep trying to catch up on Humble, man, because I'm in the Humble monthly thing.

1243
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:41,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I have so many games.

1244
01:45:42,251 --> 01:45:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I get capped out of being able to put codes into Steam all the time.

1245
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:49,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so many.

1246
01:45:49,534 --> 01:45:50,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm never going to play these games.

1247
01:45:51,946 --> 01:45:58,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as the digital pinball table, they're pretty pricey, and I don't own one, but Bobby Blackwolf does.

1248
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:00,649
[SPEAKER_02]: He might be a good guy to ask about this.

1249
01:46:01,309 --> 01:46:03,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I have played the one that is at his house, and I had fun with it.

1250
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:11,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just imagine that the TV is on its side and there, and the pinball games are on it, and it's fun.

1251
01:46:11,133 --> 01:46:19,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But another decent way to play those games is that the digital pinball recreations they have right now, like Pinball FX and those games,

1252
01:46:20,156 --> 01:46:21,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good way to get a taste for a table.

1253
01:46:22,197 --> 01:46:27,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, you don't have that sense of, oh, it's lying down in front of you and you have the buttons and all that stuff.

1254
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:39,884
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing to keep in mind, though, is that when you do have a giant setup like that, you're going to be more anxious to tilt the machine, which was an important mechanic of older pinball.

1255
01:46:39,944 --> 01:46:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, a lot of people don't like to tilt their real machines that are thousands and thousands of dollars as well, but those things are built to take a little bit of a punch because tilting is part of pinball.

1256
01:46:50,128 --> 01:46:53,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something else to consider is do you have a tendency to actually use tilt mechanics?

1257
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:57,511
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be something that – I think they can map those to buttons though.

1258
01:46:57,591 --> 01:47:01,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't own a – but it would seem very logical they could map that to buttons.

1259
01:47:01,673 --> 01:47:06,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's never going to be the same as the actual physical oomph of a tilt.

1260
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:34,295
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're right can it give you an overview of a digital table yes can you put a lot of digital tables in it yes you know there's a lot with that I think uh one of the it's Pinball FX or Zen one of the I think it's Zen I think it's the other one will actually sell you digital pinball table licenses to use their tables on the thing um but again I I would kind of refer you to Bobby Blackwolf here at VOG for further questions on that because he's done more research on that because he owns one but I had a lot of fun when I played it for what it's worth

1261
01:47:35,596 --> 01:47:36,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for the email.

1262
01:47:36,478 --> 01:47:37,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.

1263
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember you talking about a wife last time you emailed us.

1264
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:44,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations if you got married in the last couple of years, because I might have missed it, which is fair.

1265
01:47:44,894 --> 01:47:45,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But congratulations.

1266
01:47:45,996 --> 01:47:47,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad to hear you're doing well.

1267
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:49,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1268
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:53,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the next email, except I accidentally closed the mailbag because I'm a genius.

1269
01:47:53,832 --> 01:47:54,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to take me a minute here.

1270
01:47:55,273 --> 01:47:58,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Loki, do we have any last minute stories here while I open up the mailbag?

1271
01:47:58,854 --> 01:47:59,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

1272
01:47:59,575 --> 01:48:00,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's hear it.

1273
01:48:00,935 --> 01:48:07,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a last minute announcement from Nintendo that there's a Nintendo Direct coming tomorrow.

1274
01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:10,559
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we do know what it's going to be about.

1275
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:11,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be about

1276
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:19,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo World, and the upcoming Donkey Kong Country Edition to the Super Nintendo World.

1277
01:48:19,696 --> 01:48:21,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten minutes long, gonna showcase that.

1278
01:48:22,698 --> 01:48:23,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So... In Japan?

1279
01:48:24,741 --> 01:48:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in Japan.

1280
01:48:25,762 --> 01:48:28,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think they're doing it in Orlando too.

1281
01:48:28,784 --> 01:48:30,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, Hollywood I don't think is getting it.

1282
01:48:30,666 --> 01:48:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: No game information will be featured, but hey, I'm all down for hopefully some more interesting rides because the Mario Kart ride looked okay, but in the Yoshi ride looked pretty lame.

1283
01:48:41,874 --> 01:48:44,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen the things, that Donkey Kong coaster?

1284
01:48:44,176 --> 01:48:53,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks fucking incredible because they do that trick with the rails where it's actually attached to the rail underneath, but then the rail that's an illusion disappears.

1285
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:53,623
[SPEAKER_01]: That's

1286
01:48:53,683 --> 01:48:54,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1287
01:48:54,084 --> 01:48:54,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot about that.

1288
01:48:54,887 --> 01:48:56,532
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be so cool.

1289
01:48:57,094 --> 01:48:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.

1290
01:48:58,338 --> 01:48:58,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1291
01:48:58,579 --> 01:48:58,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

1292
01:48:59,181 --> 01:48:59,402
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1293
01:48:59,763 --> 01:49:00,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to our next email.

1294
01:49:01,741 --> 01:49:04,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It is from YYR, and it's always a pleasure to hear from YYR.

1295
01:49:05,283 --> 01:49:06,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, LR!

1296
01:49:06,484 --> 01:49:07,745
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know it's a YYR email.

1297
01:49:08,505 --> 01:49:10,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to let you know that it's that time again.

1298
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:15,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be attempting the DDR Max 300 Birthday Challenge again for the fifth year in a row.

1299
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:22,333
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, I'll need to clear it 45 times with at least 23 of those being on Expert Difficulty.

1300
01:49:22,753 --> 01:49:24,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 23 because it's half?

1301
01:49:24,454 --> 01:49:24,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be.

1302
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:26,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be half Expert Difficulty.

1303
01:49:26,976 --> 01:49:28,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Round it up because it's an odd number.

1304
01:49:28,777 --> 01:49:32,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, I'm going to do this as a charity stream to benefit Feeding America.

1305
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:47,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of all, for the first time, if you're one of the top 10 donors to chip in $45 or more, you can make me attempt any other single chart in DDR Grand Prix to be played after I've completed the challenge.

1306
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:50,092
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be so tired, Aaron.

1307
01:49:50,152 --> 01:49:53,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing this live on my Twitch channel at 1 p.m.

1308
01:49:53,774 --> 01:49:56,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern on Saturday, November 16th.

1309
01:49:56,615 --> 01:50:02,319
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR's Twitch channel is YYR57695.

1310
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:15,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I put the link in chat, but I could probably do you one better and actually give you a proper shout-out in chat right there so you can get people to just click that button and follow if they want to see that on Saturday, again, at 1 p.m.

1311
01:50:15,947 --> 01:50:16,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern.

1312
01:50:17,788 --> 01:50:21,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're able, please drop by, drop a few bucks for this great organization.

1313
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me suffer a bit and lengthen my suffering to the beats of your choice.

1314
01:50:26,196 --> 01:50:28,057
[SPEAKER_02]: We love suffering in this country, don't we?

1315
01:50:29,098 --> 01:50:32,902
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, San Francisco now has its own Round 1 Arcade.

1316
01:50:33,422 --> 01:50:35,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It just opened yesterday in the Stonestown Galleria.

1317
01:50:36,145 --> 01:50:38,307
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two DDR cabinets and a whole lot more.

1318
01:50:38,447 --> 01:50:39,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Go there and play.

1319
01:50:39,648 --> 01:50:40,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hear about this.

1320
01:50:40,909 --> 01:50:43,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy JD, who...

1321
01:50:44,372 --> 01:50:45,793
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1322
01:51:11,212 --> 01:51:12,934
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1323
01:51:30,149 --> 01:51:33,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, continue with YYR's email.

1324
01:51:34,215 --> 01:51:44,529
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, I would like to gladly announce that I'll be showing the finally completed Super Duper Multitasking at the upcoming Super MagFest 2025 this January.

1325
01:51:44,929 --> 01:51:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So please look forward to that.

1326
01:51:46,491 --> 01:51:47,413
[SPEAKER_02]: More details to come.

1327
01:51:48,652 --> 01:51:49,392
[SPEAKER_02]: About time.

1328
01:51:49,532 --> 01:51:51,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad to hear it, YYR, in all seriousness.

1329
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:56,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're very busy, especially being a parent now and all that stuff, but that is incredible news.

1330
01:51:57,035 --> 01:52:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I really wish I was going to MAGFest, to be honest, but so many conventions, so little time.

1331
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:04,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I can confirm...

1332
01:52:06,379 --> 01:52:10,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I have everything in the works to go to Southern Fried Game Expo next year.

1333
01:52:11,304 --> 01:52:12,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I skipped this last year.

1334
01:52:12,985 --> 01:52:14,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in 2023.

1335
01:52:14,587 --> 01:52:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I am planning to go to in 2025.

1336
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:17,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will be in Atlanta twice.

1337
01:52:18,911 --> 01:52:23,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So for what it's worth, I'm missing MAGFest, but I will be at Southern Fried this year in Atlanta in 2025.

1338
01:52:24,056 --> 01:52:24,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be fun.

1339
01:52:26,009 --> 01:52:28,431
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR concludes, thanks as always for the show.

1340
01:52:28,851 --> 01:52:33,434
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of shit sucks lately, so any opportunity we have to come together is appreciated.

1341
01:52:33,754 --> 01:52:36,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Please be well, stay safe, and have a good week.

1342
01:52:36,756 --> 01:52:38,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Love and hugs, Aaron or YYR.

1343
01:52:38,958 --> 01:52:40,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the sentiments there, Aaron.

1344
01:52:41,019 --> 01:52:42,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you take care of yourself as well.

1345
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And good luck with your stream.

1346
01:52:44,321 --> 01:52:45,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.

1347
01:52:47,096 --> 01:52:48,697
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's it for emails.

1348
01:52:48,937 --> 01:52:53,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'll give one more shout out for our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1349
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:57,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you have any chat comments, things you want to ask us about, you can put that in there as well.

1350
01:52:58,443 --> 01:53:02,285
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, we're getting a round one in New York City finally.

1351
01:53:02,905 --> 01:53:03,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's...

1352
01:53:04,414 --> 01:53:06,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, where are they going to put it?

1353
01:53:06,275 --> 01:53:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it's another converted mall situation.

1354
01:53:08,215 --> 01:53:09,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it was like a big store.

1355
01:53:10,036 --> 01:53:14,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I know NYC is built a little differently than, you know, but it'll probably look similar to San Francisco.

1356
01:53:14,337 --> 01:53:16,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a little bit more on the outskirts somewhere.

1357
01:53:17,658 --> 01:53:18,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to tell me where, Ranma.

1358
01:53:18,678 --> 01:53:19,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious.

1359
01:53:20,679 --> 01:53:22,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I doubt it's in Manhattan.

1360
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:23,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be out one of the other burbs.

1361
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:28,601
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says it's up in Queens, said Ranma.

1362
01:53:28,661 --> 01:53:29,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It's converted mall.

1363
01:53:29,562 --> 01:53:30,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's what I figured.

1364
01:53:31,684 --> 01:53:34,345
[SPEAKER_02]: HotCulture says, ours was at a Macy's.

1365
01:53:34,785 --> 01:53:39,426
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO100Matt says, I only heard of one in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

1366
01:53:39,506 --> 01:53:42,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Flushing, Queens, and Chinatown.

1367
01:53:42,186 --> 01:53:42,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1368
01:53:43,427 --> 01:53:43,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

1369
01:53:45,967 --> 01:53:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Round ones, they're showing up more and more often.

1370
01:53:48,088 --> 01:53:48,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so funny.

1371
01:53:48,928 --> 01:53:51,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I said for so long, God, I wish they'd open one up near me.

1372
01:53:51,489 --> 01:53:52,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one opens up in Roseville.

1373
01:53:52,929 --> 01:53:54,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I've maybe been there three times.

1374
01:53:55,549 --> 01:53:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Roseville's so far.

1375
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:57,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1376
01:53:58,984 --> 01:54:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the other side of town completely for me.

1377
01:54:04,954 --> 01:54:05,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

1378
01:54:05,474 --> 01:54:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just complaining.

1379
01:54:06,294 --> 01:54:06,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to complain.

1380
01:54:07,295 --> 01:54:08,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they'd put one downtown.

1381
01:54:09,296 --> 01:54:14,679
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe there's no K Street Mall anymore, but that's where I wish they'd put one is in that area.

1382
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, we have Punchbowl Social, which is not really the same thing.

1383
01:54:20,483 --> 01:54:21,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a bar.

1384
01:54:21,683 --> 01:54:21,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

1385
01:54:21,964 --> 01:54:23,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dogging on it.

1386
01:54:23,084 --> 01:54:30,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute for what it is, especially considering that the old mall downtown is where the light the beam shit that you hear whenever the Sacramento Kings win a game.

1387
01:54:31,509 --> 01:54:32,270
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the mall.

1388
01:54:33,246 --> 01:54:54,987
[SPEAKER_02]: once upon a time so they bulldozed everything except the Macy's because Macy's owned Macy's everything around it and they created that arena and now you know it from Light the Beam and all that stuff when the kings win the games that used to be the mall that's where the round one should have been and so they have a little punch bowl social but that's more of a bar that happens to have games in it which is appropriate for being right there by the arena

1389
01:54:55,367 --> 01:54:55,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awesome.

1390
01:55:23,649 --> 01:55:24,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a chain.

1391
01:55:24,909 --> 01:55:26,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them in Vegas before too.

1392
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:28,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those big candy stores.

1393
01:55:28,411 --> 01:55:29,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.

1394
01:55:30,852 --> 01:55:31,292
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1395
01:55:31,392 --> 01:55:33,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess we're going to wrap things up for the night.

1396
01:55:33,453 --> 01:55:34,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you as always for joining us.

1397
01:55:35,013 --> 01:55:39,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry, it will help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1398
01:55:39,995 --> 01:55:41,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need more voices to put out on air.

1399
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell a friend or two about the show.

1400
01:55:43,516 --> 01:55:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word.

1401
01:55:44,297 --> 01:55:46,978
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or –

1402
01:55:48,058 --> 01:55:48,779
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

1403
01:56:15,456 --> 01:56:21,762
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, we asked this week, and I think this is really funny, because I wrote it, so of course I'm funny.

1404
01:56:22,363 --> 01:56:28,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, what's your favorite video game where you get to play a hero who leads a rebellion against a corrupt government, asking for a friend?

1405
01:56:29,489 --> 01:56:33,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no reason whatsoever for writing that, but we got some good answers.

1406
01:56:34,434 --> 01:56:37,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Deft said, many Final Fantasy games come to mind right now.

1407
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:39,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think of Final Fantasy games.

1408
01:56:40,307 --> 01:56:47,131
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkDetsuya said Final Fantasy VI, though it probably took its fair share of inspiration from Star Wars, A New Hope, but a good story is a good story.

1409
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:47,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1410
01:56:48,152 --> 01:56:54,556
[SPEAKER_02]: NinjaBuddyDev says OgreBattle64, you rebel agents, you rebel agents to church.

1411
01:56:55,096 --> 01:56:58,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people think the church and the government are the same if you catch my drift.

1412
01:56:58,818 --> 01:56:59,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I do catch your drift.

1413
01:57:00,493 --> 01:57:10,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Obni, I hope I said that right, A-U-B-N-I, Obni on Blue Sky said, witnessing the destruction of the world as you know it by a ridiculous clown man with no regards for human life.

1414
01:57:10,699 --> 01:57:13,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy VI, good call, good call.

1415
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:20,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Download, spelled L-O-D-E, says, you mean aside from the guy in the picture I posted, did anybody guess the picture?

1416
01:57:20,204 --> 01:57:22,345
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Suikoden, it was the picture, Suikoden.

1417
01:57:23,025 --> 01:57:24,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, NotPictured, Gremio.

1418
01:57:25,227 --> 01:57:28,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get, maybe I'm thinking that user thought we meant specifically Suikoden, but that's all right.

1419
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:30,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take, I'll always take a Suikoden answer.

1420
01:57:31,252 --> 01:57:37,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, AKOD, who has the username FireAgua, FireAgua, walk with me.

1421
01:57:38,738 --> 01:57:40,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a good Twin Peaks reference.

1422
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to that.

1423
01:57:42,161 --> 01:57:46,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Unicorn Overlord technically counts as long as you don't get the bad ending.

1424
01:57:47,465 --> 01:57:48,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very true.

1425
01:57:48,086 --> 01:57:48,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.

1426
01:57:49,126 --> 01:57:49,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

1427
01:57:50,985 --> 01:57:56,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Ostro in chat says, while it's more so about a corrupt corporation, what's the difference anymore?

1428
01:57:56,669 --> 01:57:58,030
[SPEAKER_02]: The game was just a lot of fun.

1429
01:57:58,151 --> 01:57:59,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Faction for the PlayStation 2.

1430
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:05,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dartusia says, don't forget to do alt text next time you do images in our chat.

1431
01:58:05,156 --> 01:58:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did forget.

1432
01:58:05,997 --> 01:58:06,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry about that.

1433
01:58:06,577 --> 01:58:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually pretty good about that.

1434
01:58:08,258 --> 01:58:29,637
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do all that from my desktop not my phone so it's set a little differently thank you for the reminder because I do try to use alt text to at least convey like if there's words on the screen or the bare minimum of what's happening yeah so thank you for the call out I will fix that next time I want to see if we got any other there was an interesting bleep that we got from because I thought this was cool

1435
01:58:31,218 --> 01:58:32,399
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1436
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:59,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it says in the follow-up, now Bobby Blackwolf liked the post.

1437
01:58:59,764 --> 01:59:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, that's a throwback from when I used to listen to All Games Interactive.

1438
01:59:03,308 --> 01:59:04,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Blast from the past.

1439
01:59:04,369 --> 01:59:06,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to check out all of y'all's stuff.

1440
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shout out to you, Ante, if you are out there listening tonight.

1441
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:13,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back from all of us here at OLR.

1442
01:59:13,619 --> 01:59:17,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I always love that, that people are like, wait, you guys are still around?

1443
01:59:19,568 --> 01:59:24,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's anyone who got the Guinness book that was like, hold up, that show's still on?

1444
01:59:28,633 --> 01:59:28,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1445
01:59:29,173 --> 01:59:30,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, I love it.

1446
01:59:30,113 --> 01:59:31,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, probably not.

1447
01:59:31,554 --> 01:59:31,874
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1448
01:59:32,274 --> 01:59:33,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Who buys the Guinness book anymore?

1449
01:59:33,615 --> 01:59:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already in the spiel to wrap up tonight, so I already said the news.

1450
01:59:36,617 --> 01:59:39,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about, I will try to remember to work blue sky to my rotation.

1451
01:59:40,038 --> 01:59:42,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to write a note in my show role or I'll forget.

1452
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:44,601
[SPEAKER_02]: But that brings us to final thoughts.

1453
01:59:44,641 --> 01:59:45,681
[SPEAKER_02]: We really are about wrapped up.

1454
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:46,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So Loki, your final thought tonight.

1455
01:59:48,193 --> 02:00:04,509
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully I get a lot done this week not work related hopefully a lot Minecraft work my final thought is a lot of people on the red side of the house have been saying what happened this last week is a mandate

1456
02:00:05,638 --> 02:00:07,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I also say that it's a mandate.

1457
02:00:08,019 --> 02:00:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I say this is a mandate for me to be an even louder and more obnoxious homosexual over the next four years.

1458
02:00:14,221 --> 02:00:18,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not going anywhere no matter how hard you try.

1459
02:00:19,162 --> 02:00:19,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1460
02:00:20,663 --> 02:00:21,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good week everybody.

1461
02:00:21,603 --> 02:00:21,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

1462
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:41,066
[SPEAKER_04]: To join us for our live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

1463
02:00:42,647 --> 02:00:52,234
[SPEAKER_04]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1464
02:00:54,996 --> 02:00:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.
