1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:19,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Some may have considered it inevitable that the PlayStation Portal would eventually decouple from only supporting one's own PlayStation 5, but given the existence of PlayStation Now streaming to Aveda and PlayStation TV, I wonder why it wasn't there to begin with.

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:24,502
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably boils down to the truth of manufacturing, computing, really anything involving a consumer market.

3
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:26,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Scaling is always the hardest task to do.

4
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:28,886
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Economic Realities Headline.

5
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:34,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this portable gaming update and the rest of the week's gaming news.

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

7
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:41,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

8
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:46,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:56,603
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, live and back once again with episode number 1026 of our show for tonight, November the 24th of 2024.

10
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:01,687
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts.

11
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:04,889
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:06,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,891
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Jamie?

15
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:09,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lot better.

16
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,814
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice is still healing, but yeah, doing better.

17
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say, you sound a lot better, even if maybe not 100%.

18
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:16,417
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like 99.8%.

19
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:17,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd actually put it more like 85%.

20
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:17,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

21
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been drinking cold things.

22
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:25,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

23
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,259
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got, I'm drinking hot things.

24
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got a new coffee maker today because our- Another Keurig?

25
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:39,085
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a different, I guess other brands can make Keurigs now because I think it's a Ninja, like our, the thing that makes the ice cream.

26
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

27
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have an, well, it's Costco, whatever it is.

28
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:44,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So my husband is a giant Costco queen.

29
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,229
[SPEAKER_03]: and always looking at the deals.

30
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess there was some type of ninja coffee maker that was available cheaper there.

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:58,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been hinting that our existing coffee maker is kind of old and isn't looking any the wiser for being an old device.

32
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should probably just replace it.

33
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:04,517
[SPEAKER_03]: So we bought a fancy new one for like $100 that's usually like $150 or something like that.

34
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:05,958
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad.

35
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:12,081
[SPEAKER_01]: When we replaced my old Keurig, we got the same quote model, but it had like

36
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:15,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Internet and QR codes and shit.

37
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:15,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:17,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, do I need this?

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess so.

41
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:20,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

42
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: DLC for your coffee maker.

43
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:29,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this one, though, also does like the little, like the actual pots of coffee, a carafe, I guess.

44
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:39,336
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, well, that's more like a, but you know, it actually does like the fuller coffee brewing that will, so you can actually switch back and forth between K-cups and grounds, like really easy.

45
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:43,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's kind of cool because that might help us in like using less K-cups overall.

46
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I just buy them all biodegradable.

47
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the refillable cups.

48
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:45,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

49
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:05,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually always scrape out the crowns and save them for my compost anyway.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,881
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a thing I do.

51
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:07,362
[SPEAKER_01]: That works.

52
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:09,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it keeps compost from smelling as bad.

53
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, it makes all your flowers smell like coffee.

54
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,490
[SPEAKER_03]: The best part of waking up.

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,312
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Coffee DRM.

56
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have come full circle from that.

57
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:21,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Coffee DRM was a big thing with Keurig 2.0 and we talked about

58
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:23,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's had coffee or not, but let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

59
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:24,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't.

60
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say you're not a coffee drinker at all from what I remember.

61
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a white mocha, but not usually.

62
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a sweet treat?

63
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,296
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's coffee.

64
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:55,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I take that as coffee.

65
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,018
[SPEAKER_03]: A white mocha?

66
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's really coffee.

67
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a suggestion of coffee.

68
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:02,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got coffee in it.

69
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, white chocolate is not chocolate.

70
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,963
[SPEAKER_01]: This is us dashing your dreams.

71
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:11,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

72
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:12,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

73
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no standards for coffee.

74
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,988
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I'll drink another.

75
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,970
[SPEAKER_03]: See if I give a shit.

76
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:20,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Drink too much and you will.

77
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing otherwise, Loki?

78
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:26,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing okay.

79
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been very busy this week.

80
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:28,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

81
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:33,849
[SPEAKER_03]: This was your big week off to work on your content.

82
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you're doing other things too, but I know you're working on your content.

83
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I saw you put out at least one new video, like came across my eye.

84
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching for a little bit.

85
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:47,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like you were building a new, I think a new carnival attraction in a space.

86
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,534
[SPEAKER_03]: You were like, here's this big blank space.

87
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:49,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put a thing here.

88
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:50,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I added plushies.

89
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:51,454
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

90
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So collectible plushies that you can get prize tickets.

91
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I made Redemption games.

92
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:05,837
[SPEAKER_08]: All the rides are Redemption stuff now and you trade in tickets for plushies and it all works with Redstone and custom models and all that stuff.

93
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:09,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the way I spent this week on instead of working on the water ride.

94
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I have started working on the water ride this week though.

95
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,299
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I'm still worried that it's going to

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

97
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:20,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I was complaining to people earlier, as I do.

98
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:26,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I put in three weeks worth of work into something, and it gets no views.

99
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:30,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And my channel now, the last 28 days, I've lost eight subscribers.

100
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:37,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And my watch time has gone from... I used to average about 100 views a day, and it's now 16.

101
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:38,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like...

102
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Why put the effort in if no one's going to see it?

103
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:45,708
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

104
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's annoying.

105
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:48,792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a landscape.

106
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:56,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess if you don't just do what everybody else is doing, then this is what you get, I guess.

107
00:05:56,696 --> 00:06:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can see where that gets really frustrating and stuff, but I really hope you don't let that slow you down.

108
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,061
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube is a tough cookie to crack.

109
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to do a little more on YouTube.

110
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:12,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say I'm not taking the effort

111
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:14,685
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:48,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I had tech difficulty fuck up an entire video and it's hard to bounce back from that so trying to bounce back but you know I put out a good 18 or 19 classic gaming videos and those are really hard to get traction and the ones that are I think the most viewed out of all of those is my Super Mario Brothers 3 which was actually a Twitch stream

113
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:52,259
[SPEAKER_03]: that I archived on YouTube and is getting a lot more views.

114
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why, because it wasn't a very good playthrough.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept dying all of the time on level eight.

116
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe people enjoy seeing that.

117
00:06:59,361 --> 00:06:59,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

118
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Or because it is such a popular game where people are searching for it.

119
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:06,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would have thought maybe the niche stuff would get a little more traction.

120
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:12,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But then a random ass Diablo 4 video I made probably got 10 times the views any of my classic gaming stuff did.

121
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:16,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's okay because, again, I'm trying not to do it for...

122
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:43,290
[SPEAKER_08]: that like I'm trying to do it for the whole like it's kind of fun to build an archive of playing classic games and having that library and playing the retro achievements into it and all of that um no I and I get that it's just more of like I look at like next season where I'm attempting to do something because last season was very stressful because there was and this is kind of a pattern that I keep going through where I have a general idea of what I'm doing but it's not

123
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,291
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

124
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:26,818
[SPEAKER_08]: like I don't know it's at the level of like where there's large creators that do something similar and that's like the content from like their entire server for months and it's getting so much attention to it and it's like I'm gonna do something very similar and it's gonna get no one watching it like I literally have just the people that I play with watching my content which is

125
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:52,636
[SPEAKER_08]: it's weird because I have like 3,000 followers or 3,000 subscribers I have a few hundred on social media and like I get almost nothing and it's it's not even necessarily that it's bad like the content's bad it's YouTube itself doesn't push it and you can see there's a marked difference when the algorithm decides oh hey I'm gonna wake up today and actually do my job like it

126
00:08:53,363 --> 00:09:03,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It... Like, the last episode I put out, before this one, it was dead for a while, and then all of a sudden the algorithm pushed it for, like, 24 hours, and then it's dead again.

127
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:07,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just... They just don't do their job on their end, I guess.

128
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:08,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Or whatever.

129
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:08,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

130
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:15,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's competing against a lot of stuff, but there's also a lot of stuff out there that's not as good that gets a lot more views.

131
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:16,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know what the...

132
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:40,147
[SPEAKER_08]: do with it other than like do what everybody else is doing oh it's big tutorials cool then that's all they'll come to your channel for or you'll just do a mod showcase video and that's all they'll come to your channel for they won't actually watch your other content have you thought about trying to do more like i know it's not good for the watch minutes but like just to try to like get people's attention and people can be very fickle have you thought about trying to do more of the i don't want to say like youtube shorts

133
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:41,327
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:03,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to some of your old content and do like, okay, here is the time lapse of the Mega Man build.

135
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:14,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Because yes, there's not a lot of people relative to the scale of things have seen your build, which means there's still a huge untapped audience and Mega Man 2 shit is timeless.

136
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:21,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say go back and try to just extract some of the time lapse and those quick hits and try to put those out there on things like YouTube Shorts and TikToks.

137
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a bitch with editing, but like...

138
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:24,902
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

139
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's that funny, but okay.

140
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:50,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it worked for TikTok nature and all that stuff.

141
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.

142
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's put this weird pressure on me where I'm like, well, whatever I post on TikTok next better be funny.

143
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:01,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, shit.

144
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:03,503
[SPEAKER_08]: No, and I get that.

145
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I could be better about doing that.

146
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:09,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I did some of that for my first SMP.

147
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of went back and did some of those.

148
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:18,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really had time to do a lot of the editing to get the rest of them, mainly because it was hard to condense it down to one minute.

149
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:25,218
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that that cap has gone up a little bit, that should be a little bit easier.

150
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And my newer time lapses are much shorter, too, because I've kind of tried to...

151
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:34,534
[SPEAKER_08]: um change the way I make content to make it more engaging so that

152
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:38,053
[SPEAKER_08]: People stay around longer, but I don't know.

153
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to change it too much.

154
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:42,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to defeat you because I think your videos are very good.

155
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,516
[SPEAKER_03]: You explain things very well.

156
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You do a good story arc.

157
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:48,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just leaning into, unfortunately, people don't have the attention span.

158
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:49,458
[SPEAKER_03]: They want the quick hit.

159
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:51,779
[SPEAKER_03]: They want that shot of, ooh, neat, you know, thing.

160
00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:03,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, well, you know, if your old content has kind of run its course, I say recycle it into quick hits and things that are going to grab people's attention and just see what's the worst that can happen.

161
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:06,218
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, yeah, for sure.

162
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, a lovely content creation discussion here.

163
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a holiday week in America, and we've got some news, but we're always happy to talk about that kind of stuff.

164
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:24,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say Bobby Blackwolf says, short video that's too long, didn't read, and then have a card with a longer video at the end, maybe.

165
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can link to the full stuff.

166
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:57,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my game plan with the classic stuff too is not so and I'm waiting for I'm the same thing you are is that technically three minute stuff is supposed to be in YouTube shorts but they're not uploading directly in there yet so I don't trust the algorithm to be pushing them until but supposedly that's supposed to be done at the end of the month we'll see but I plan to go back through every single classic game video I've uploaded and make a short out of it and trickle those out too I'll tell you one thing I'm stopping doing is letting Twitch upload my shorts for me

167
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:24,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do a much better editing job myself oh using the automated thing or whatever yeah it's just so limited and you know one of the things I could do in Final Cut is just like choose where my camera pans I guess of the screen instead of just fixing it at one point so yeah didn't you have a dead by daylight TikTok that got like thousands of views I swear I saw one of your TikToks came up on my feed and I was like dang she got she got a lot of hits on this what

168
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:54,158
[SPEAKER_08]: a couple maybe hold on let me I mean I don't have like a whole ton of followers on TikTok wasn't there I don't remember if you guys showed me or if it was Arrington that showed me but there's a way in OBS you can set up where it records vertical and yes vertical yes it can be done but I couldn't tell you how to do it but it is I would still prefer to do my own editing well right it's so that you can record your gameplay

169
00:13:55,456 --> 00:14:17,436
[SPEAKER_03]: already in the format and then you just edit that down it makes it a little bit easier than having to like reformat everything yeah and that just depends on how you're cranking out the content like what what factory is going to work for you yeah i i do believe it's possible Loki i just couldn't tell you how to do it yeah anyway yeah i have like one of my big ones on here is um

170
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:25,779
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ones where I sneak away from the killers and they don't see me or do dishes with them or meme around.

171
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:26,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

172
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:35,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think, Loki, I don't know how much you're leveraging TikTok, but TikTok will give you 200 views on every video.

173
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:36,047
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it won't.

174
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:37,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I've tried.

175
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:37,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

176
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I've re-uploaded some of my shorts there.

177
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:40,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

178
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

179
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:42,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Hardly anything.

180
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:43,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

181
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you.

182
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:45,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

183
00:14:46,553 --> 00:15:11,865
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah because I did that and they even like they have even like long format stuff that's on there sometimes so I was like okay sure I'll try a long format one I'll try a short no it's just it's awful I no thanks interesting well then it's really gonna be interesting to see what happens with TikTok and this whole you know they're threatening to remove it from stores and all that stuff and I don't it's never gonna happen

184
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:41,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know like apparently I shudder as I say this because I don't like talking about politics right now but apparently the CEO of TikTok is attempting to go kiss the ring because he was talking to Lex Luthor over at X about who of course is you know the first bitch now as you know how to assumably how to get around the TikTok ban and to try to convince Chitalini that it would be in his good favor to unban the TikTok thing.

185
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:52,204
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't know how that's all going to play out but because I would think if you're TikTok and you're about to get banned you're going to create a web app but how effective is that going to be?

186
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:52,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

187
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:53,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

188
00:15:54,165 --> 00:16:01,490
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been talk about also TikTok might spin off into two different companies or something so I guess a lot can happen between now and January but I do feel like TikTok

189
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:26,945
[SPEAKER_03]: you know maybe it's just recency bias my own luck on there but I feel like TikTok kind of at least nudges it a little bit I did notice the video that went viral didn't it started with a normal pattern as all my videos do but it was getting more likes in that time frame and I think because of that TikTok pushed it more that's what happened so you got to encourage your friends to hit that content early and push the like button for what it's worth

190
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bobby says reposts are better than likes.

191
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that doesn't surprise me either.

192
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:35,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think my content ever got reposted until that one.

193
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:37,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway, weird.

194
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:39,616
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

195
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:42,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, enough talk about content creation.

196
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into video game news.

197
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:44,319
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're here to talk about.

198
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:44,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Create the content.

199
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

200
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's create the content.

201
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:55,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about an award ceremony that has a content creator of the year award announced the nominee list this week.

202
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:58,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some controversy along with that, as there usually is.

203
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,686
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one is very interesting.

204
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:01,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you want to start us off tonight?

205
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:05,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so Game Awards are right around the corner, I think.

206
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it like two weeks?

207
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:12,019
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on the 12th, a little bit later this year, I guess.

208
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's usually a little later than it is.

209
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's around like the 8th or the 7th normally, I guess.

210
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:18,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It just didn't work out.

211
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:23,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so they announced, of course, the different categories and the nominees.

212
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:28,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, starting things off, obviously, the big one, Game of the Year.

213
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:40,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the, I mean, nothing really surprising, I think, but we've got Astro Bot, Boletro, Black Myth Wukong, Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erd Tree.

214
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:45,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of interesting to see that DLC is Game of the Year.

215
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:46,788
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of like...

216
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,119
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

217
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor Re-Fantasio.

218
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Elden Ring should not be in there.

219
00:17:57,663 --> 00:17:59,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

220
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about that a little bit.

221
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:04,345
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we feeling about DLC as game of the year?

222
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:06,086
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

223
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:12,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to present the other side of it is many people would argue that that DLC was so...

224
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:22,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a heavy volume, such a large brush of DLC that it's almost like its own standalone game.

225
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Give its own category then.

226
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:25,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, no.

227
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,200
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not game of the year.

228
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Elden Ring did not come out this year.

229
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:29,902
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

230
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:30,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

231
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree it should not be Game of the Year nominated.

232
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:35,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has nothing to do with the quality of it.

233
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:36,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's a great DLC.

234
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:37,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is my reasoning.

235
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to explain why.

236
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I feel like I have a decent reason why it shouldn't be nominated.

237
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:51,465
[SPEAKER_03]: When your game goes to win Game of the Year, that is a huge notch under your belt.

238
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:55,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge uplift on your resume.

239
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,148
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge thing to be able to say that you're working on.

240
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, if this DLC wins that award...

241
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Elden Ring as a game has won that award twice.

242
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:08,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, it's very similar to like, let's say Titanic.

243
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:11,421
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie Titanic gets nominated for all of these Oscars.

244
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:19,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 15, 20 years later, they re-released it in 3D and it would be similar to giving it an Oscar for visual effects again.

245
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:21,530
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,631
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to have to buy Elden Ring in order to play the DLC.

247
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:45,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people want to explore this game, they're going to have to buy the base game.

248
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:51,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like it's getting that bump in sales, that uplift in sales, that recognition twice.

249
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's taking it away from somebody else.

250
00:19:54,995 --> 00:20:02,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether that somebody else is a AAA title like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth or an indie title like Bellatro, which...

251
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand the hype behind Bellatro.

252
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:08,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say it.

253
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:13,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I've played the game and it did not land for me the way it's been landing for everybody else.

254
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I'm happy to see an indie studio in the running.

255
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:21,792
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people clearly seem to enjoy it and it clicked for people the way it didn't click for me.

256
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can say I'm happy to see the game in there.

257
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:26,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy for its fans.

258
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:28,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would rather see a studio like that

259
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:36,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the Game of the Year award, then the Elden Ring Studio will take that award home for the second time for the same product.

260
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:39,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

261
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:42,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Game Direction, ironically, the same list.

262
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:47,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not that different from like the Oscars and Best Director.

263
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:49,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes there'll be like one that changes, but that's...

264
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:54,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the director's the one that oversees a lot of the package.

265
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that surprising, to be honest.

266
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get some comments in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

267
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:02,570
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL says, it's like if a movie made an extended cut.

268
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

269
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:08,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the Richard Donner edition of Superman 2, I don't think it was nominated for anything.

270
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:09,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still the same movie.

271
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:17,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I would say, if anything, when you completely deconstruct or reconstruct a movie, maybe, but y'all get my point.

272
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:44,210
[SPEAKER_08]: uh Dark2CS says I agree with Rob they got their trophy let someone else have one this year and I wouldn't even care if From Software got another trophy for a different product I wouldn't care yeah like I said put put have a category yeah that's like best DLC or something like that if you want to do their best expansion or something but I mean the fact that they've gotten I mean they have some down especially when we get down to the very bottom of the list here you know where it's like

273
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:46,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this one right here.

274
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:47,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Most anticipated game.

275
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:49,287
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a throwaway category.

276
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

277
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:54,393
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we judging the best hype machine that's coming out?

278
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,217
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the game awards, Loki?

279
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it is a hype machine, I guess.

280
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:02,022
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just stupid.

281
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:04,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... I don't...

282
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

283
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I just don't really want to see that stuff.

284
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:12,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwolf says, yes, it's GTA 6.

285
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:17,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, I believe will be the big, like, reveal.

286
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, we've already seen it.

287
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to get another taste.

288
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:25,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's my bet for the Game Awards trailer that's going to have everybody going, oh my god!

289
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:29,159
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, after the GTA 6 update for life.

290
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:29,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

291
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll eat it up.

292
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with that.

293
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:31,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you will.

294
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:32,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

295
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get some other comments though.

296
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:40,605
[SPEAKER_03]: S200Matt says, I feel like it should be lumped into best ongoing game than game of the year.

297
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:43,068
[SPEAKER_03]: DLC equals ongoing support in my mind.

298
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:43,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that.

299
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:55,499
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, an interesting comment too on that category because who wasn't there was World of Warcraft, which, you know, they haven't been there for years and years, but there's several people that would argue that

300
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:21,726
[SPEAKER_03]: wow's recent expansion has really brought that game out of a rut and it's really pushed things forward and they've been doing a lot for their 20th anniversary and so forth and that maybe they deserve some flowers for it this year but they didn't get it maybe because the game's so fucking old at this point i don't know but just something i noticed uh some yeah but you know who's not in best ongoing gaming despite the fact that they keep giving us brand new dlc free over and over and over and over again isn't in there no man sky's not in there

301
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:24,587
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, they've been in there almost every other year.

302
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:26,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to keep it 100.

303
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep it 100.

304
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:30,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, No Man's Sky has been delivering on the DLC.

305
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:31,629
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a great job.

306
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:33,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as much this year as the last few years.

307
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're working on a new game.

308
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,731
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably just don't have as many people on it.

309
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:41,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Final Fantasy XIV in there?

310
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:42,932
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

311
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:47,774
[SPEAKER_03]: While I think that's great, and I love XIV...

312
00:23:49,380 --> 00:24:15,027
[SPEAKER_08]: The Endwalker Cycle was not great at the end and Dawn Trail as an expansion is fine but it's not as good as their prior expansions Speaking of best ongoing games as we were talking about it Destiny 2 The Final Shape which that's also technically DLC or expansion or something like that Diablo 4, Final Fantasy 14 Fortnite and Helldivers 2 I would actually say Diablo 4 has done a better job last year than 14

313
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,314
[SPEAKER_03]: of the games I play.

314
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know how much they have tweaked Diablo 4 and how fucking well that game has been uplifted in the last year.

315
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:25,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in an incredible state right now.

316
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

317
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm just a fan, biased, whatever.

318
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:30,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Best narrative.

319
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:40,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, Metaphor Re-Fantasio, Senua's Saga Hellblade 2, and Silent Hill 2.

320
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:41,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

321
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:58,457
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a couple games in there so there was an interesting comment here from ZenMonkey11 and I want to get to this because I think this is a valid perspective from the other side saying only way I would agree that DLC shouldn't get game of the year is if there is another game that should be there

322
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of, I take from that comment, kind of insinuating that you know what, overall the quality of games this year we're not looking at the same type of year we've had in years past this is not, you know, that DLC made it because other games weren't up to the bar however, I would say you probably named three other games in there

323
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:24,956
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe I think people would accept as a game of the year.

324
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:27,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth, I think was very well received.

325
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:29,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised.

326
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:32,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much as they overhyped Hellblade 2, I'm surprised that one isn't in there.

327
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:35,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what was the other one you said?

328
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:38,023
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one.

329
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Silent Hill 2.

330
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:40,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Silent Hill 2.

331
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:47,008
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people thought that was really... But then I guess we'd be asked this, should a remake be game of the year?

332
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

333
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that we'd be having that conversation.

334
00:25:48,971 --> 00:26:17,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean obviously because Final Fantasy 7 you know is in there again so I mean that makes sense that it being that it is a remake I would say not a remaster a remaster should not be in there a remake yes because it is technically a new game maybe just like saying you know like you know a new Batman movie of remaking Batman or something for the millionth time you know should that not be considered for an Oscar or something like that um

335
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:18,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, obviously it should.

336
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:21,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you the other game, it hasn't come up yet.

337
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,613
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura knows the other game that people are saying ought to be in that game of the year discussion.

338
00:26:28,194 --> 00:26:32,076
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another recent release that people are saying ought to be in that discussion.

339
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:33,837
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Veilguard.

340
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:38,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Veilguard from, you know, but that's, you know, again.

341
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,020
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not that great.

342
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:45,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't get me wrong, I love it, but it has so many problems with it.

343
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,240
[SPEAKER_01]: The writing is not great.

344
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

345
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

346
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:57,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Art Direction, Astro Bot, Black Myth, Wukong, Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erd Tree, Metaphor, Refantasio, and Neva.

347
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:01,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

348
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:10,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Music and score, Astro Bot, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Metaphor, Silent Hill 2, and Stellar Blade.

349
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:36,254
[SPEAKER_08]: um let's see a lot of these are a lot of the same stuff uh Call of Duty Black Ops 6 for best audio design um Astro Bot, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Sending With Saga Hellblade 2 and Silent Hill 2 uh performances so uh voice acting and whatnot and performance capture uh Brianna White from Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uh Hannah Tell from Life is Strange Double Exposure

350
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:41,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Humbly, uh, or Humberly Gonzalez for Star Wars Outlaws.

351
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:52,894
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a game that, I mean, I don't know if it did that well, but, uh, Luke Roberts, Silent Hill 2, and Melina, uh, Jurgens for Sinuous Saga 2, uh, Hellblade 2.

352
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:56,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

353
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:59,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we should go through all of these real quick.

354
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:03,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Accessibility.

355
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:04,619
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Indie?

356
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's do Games for Impact.

357
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Which we know which one will win.

358
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the DLC.

359
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:12,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm sorry, it's in the game of the year.

360
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:14,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know which one will win.

361
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,289
[SPEAKER_03]: But what are the other ones nominated?

362
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:45,545
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, so indie, actually funny enough, it is, uh, so indie game, we have Animal Well um, Bolotro uh, Lorelei and Laser Eyes which, that looked pretty good, uh, Neva and UFO 50 and then uh, community support though Nomad Sky is in that one, so Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy 14, Fortnite Helldivers 2, and Nomad Sky for best community support, so I get that, you know feels right, um

363
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:56,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Mobile Game AFK Journey, Baltro, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket Weathering Waves, Zenless Zone Zero

364
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:28,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think the cutoff for the nominations is like maybe like a week before they come out it's like November 15th it's pretty fucking late in the game because uh you know why they want people they want to cover the period through Black Friday and all the game releases it's always been like that because sometimes the big games of the year like especially a Nintendo side they don't hit until like that Friday before Black Friday

365
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:31,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know the cutoff is all the way out there.

366
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they may have gotten a preview of that game, you know, the influencers on that.

367
00:29:36,454 --> 00:29:41,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say, I've been playing a shit ton of that pocket trading card game.

368
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a well done dopamine machine.

369
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:46,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, yeah.

370
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:49,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say I'm shocked to hear it in there.

371
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:52,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's talk about some games that we haven't mentioned yet.

372
00:29:52,746 --> 00:30:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Best Action Adventure, we have Astro Bot, Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown, Silent Hill 2, and Star Wars Outlaws.

373
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:14,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Role Playing Game, Dragon's Dogma 2, Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, and Metaphor Refantasio.

374
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:21,449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny that three of those are remakes or like DLC or remakes.

375
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Best fighting game.

376
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this feels weird too because these are all old games or at least this one is.

377
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:34,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics.

378
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:35,653
[SPEAKER_08]: None of those are new.

379
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:44,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Granblue Fantasy vs. Rising, Multiverses, and Tekken 8.

380
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:53,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know if the Marvel's... It's a good collection, but really, I guess it's scraping the barrel for fighting games, I guess.

381
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but it really does feel like this year the awards are really going to be the sideshow.

382
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:13,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really just about the hype machine of whatever trailers are going to be showing off and whatever other stunts he's going to be pulling this year with, you know, people, celebrities that show up to do whatever, special dedications or whatever.

383
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:14,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It just really feels like...

384
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:15,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-mm-mm-mm

385
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:54,301
[SPEAKER_08]: and then let's do best family games so mostly Nintendo but not all Nintendo so we've got Astro Bot Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom The Plucky Squire Princess Peach Showtime and Super Mario Party Jamboree

386
00:31:56,202 --> 00:32:02,446
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ 100 Matt reminds us jury voting is 90% of the vote and you can see a list of those sites on the Game Awards site.

387
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Fan votes are 10% and that is a good thing.

388
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Fans should not have 100% of the vote.

389
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:14,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at any story about Metacritic bombing and all that bullshit.

390
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:15,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The fan vote should be 5%.

391
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:19,478
[SPEAKER_03]: The fan vote should be tie-breaking only.

392
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:33,967
[SPEAKER_08]: The shockingly large percentage of people, and it really should be much smaller, that just get like butthurt about, you know, pronouns.

393
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:36,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, come on.

394
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, man.

395
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:39,530
[SPEAKER_03]: No, those people should not be voting on Game of the Year.

396
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right there with you.

397
00:32:42,476 --> 00:33:02,727
[SPEAKER_08]: best adaptation and this I think is pretty close with some of the stuff that they've got here so Arcane great series, Fallout excellent series, Knuckles didn't watch it but I hear it's good I'm definitely gonna go see the new Sonic movie Like a Dragon, Yakuza Tomb Raider, The Legend of Warcraft wait I heard that wasn't good

398
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, right, I didn't say that one was good.

399
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:09,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, to be fair, you did kind of gloss past that one.

400
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,510
[SPEAKER_03]: You did say all the others were good, and then you said, well, that one was there too.

401
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:12,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Not you.

402
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:13,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you.

403
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:21,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so, yeah, there's more, like, esports stuff as well.

404
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:22,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know.

405
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:24,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

406
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:24,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

407
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:43,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Black Myth Wukong.

408
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:45,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

409
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:49,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard that some people straight up hated that game.

410
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:51,415
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like that's a controversial choice.

411
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:53,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it doesn't go to Elden Ring.

412
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:55,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it doesn't go to Elden Ring either.

413
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:58,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

414
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be fine with that.

415
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:02,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Astro Bot.

416
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:03,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope Astro Bot takes it.

417
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see Astro Bot.

418
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:09,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Astro Bot would be a great, great win for the year.

419
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:15,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the way they've really got that magic.

420
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,823
[SPEAKER_03]: For everybody who's ever said, I wish they would release Mario on the PlayStation 5.

421
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:25,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay, you have Astro Bot, which is just as good.

422
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:47,346
[SPEAKER_08]: or just like just to just get out of this mindset that we have to create all these like Dark Souls clone games like can we just not can something else win like can we differentiate you know our library of games that are released in the years like so many of these are like oh it's a Souls like it's a Souls like oh stop

423
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:50,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Put out something new, please.

424
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:53,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf says Bellatro will win it.

425
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:58,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I would love to see that because I would love what that would mean for the indie developers and so forth.

426
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need a year where an indie kind of snatches the prize.

427
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:07,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially in a year where DLC is going to be nominated, I think that would be a very interesting thing to see.

428
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:13,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, but it's so weird because I can sit here and go, I mean, the game didn't really land for me, but cool.

429
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:17,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still root it on for what it stands for, I guess.

430
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:18,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

431
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:25,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that did land for us this week.

432
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:31,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Or actually, I want to talk about one that didn't, but we'll talk about the types of games we've been playing this week in our gaming week.

433
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,545
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

434
00:35:33,895 --> 00:35:39,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I played Dead by Daylight, which was, you know, Dead by Daylight.

435
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:49,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to play a lot of Spirit in 2v8, and I'm slowly getting my groove back with playing her, so it's been kind of fun.

436
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:55,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, I think I have more fun just farming and memeing around than actually playing seriously these days.

437
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:56,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

438
00:35:56,597 --> 00:36:20,053
[SPEAKER_01]: um there's people who just take that game way too seriously um I also played uh Dragon Age Veilguard which I am enjoying don't get me wrong it's just there's there's there's problems the writing is just not great there's continuity issues it's like there's all this lore that they said we're just gonna look at like a third of it yeah that'll be fine um

439
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:27,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played Polya, which I do, the Suica game.

440
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a little bit with my Vroid thing today.

441
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:37,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's more of a model maker, but it's kind of fun to me like a game.

442
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's been a really stupidly, redonkulously busy week.

443
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

444
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll move on to Loki.

445
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:49,149
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

446
00:36:50,280 --> 00:37:15,829
[SPEAKER_08]: it's basically just Minecraft but speaking of Minecraft there was a new movie trailer put out an actual trailer not the teaser this time and it looks it looks better I think some people still hate it I mean I'll still go see it but yeah they're leaning into like memes and stuff like that because it has the line you know as a child I yearned for the mines so it's silly

447
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:21,002
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's pretty much just a final... It was just...

448
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:24,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Minecraft this week.

449
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:27,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Mainly working on the theme park stuff.

450
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:33,979
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of setup for all the plushies and stuff that I was adding to the game because it's essentially on the back end of a resource pack.

451
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,921
[SPEAKER_08]: It's setting up 110 models.

452
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:51,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully I built models that use player skins so I just had to get our player skins that we were using and alt skins and just dump them in there and then I could link them to the different models that I would create using Blockbench and everything.

453
00:37:53,512 --> 00:38:14,191
[SPEAKER_08]: and then setting that all up in game and setting up all the redstone in game and building all that and the filming at least didn't take very long although I had to re-film stuff because my wife is during the day and so my wife was on a like a call and my mic was picking up audio from that I was like dang it so I had to redo some of that um

454
00:38:15,063 --> 00:38:17,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a little bit of a mess, but yeah, it turned out pretty good.

455
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:22,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like, uh, the mini game, the new mini fishing mini game was pretty fun.

456
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:31,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we may have to, uh, cheat in some invulnerable, uh, basically, uh, rods with no durability, um,

457
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:54,178
[SPEAKER_08]: on them or without you know taking durability you can make some invulnerable ones because uh every time you play the game like it essentially just toasts one of those enchanted fishing rods it's gonna be a pain to keep to have you know fixing those up every time so we may have to just out of the sake of my sanity and maintaining that game just you know

458
00:38:54,742 --> 00:39:00,510
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll throw one of those in there so that it's not a problem for people visiting the park and everything after it's all done.

459
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:20,508
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're doing this year, we have the cast members, which are the folks that make videos and YouTube content and stuff like that.

460
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:24,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have supporting cast, which are people that play with us that don't make content.

461
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have their own area, but they also are working on the end of season project.

462
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:38,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have a giant build that we haven't seen yet that they're working on that's going to be our finale that we go to this place.

463
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:39,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And so...

464
00:39:40,151 --> 00:40:05,205
[SPEAKER_08]: that's been pretty fun but they've now finished that and they have like two months left and so he's coming to help out with the theme park he's building like a Wild West area and like you want to do an aquarium and so that's kind of we're filling in stuff in the park and he helped out a lot with the build that I'm working on right now a lot of the terraforming for that because I was just struggling to get it I just couldn't

465
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

466
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:31,103
[SPEAKER_08]: It's big.

467
00:40:31,123 --> 00:40:32,724
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't supposed to be this big.

468
00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:45,331
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network has kind of a question that I've been marinating on for you as well, which is what are your thoughts on the new Minecraft movie trailer that came out this last week?

469
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, as I said, I thought it looked pretty good.

470
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:51,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a new trailer.

471
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:55,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It gave us a little bit of the backstory of some of the characters.

472
00:40:55,906 --> 00:41:01,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously the one that... Oh, what's his name?

473
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:04,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of his name now.

474
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:05,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Aquaman.

475
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:08,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jason Momoa.

476
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason Momoa, thank you.

477
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:15,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason Momoa's character plays like... He's kind of like a... Was it a...

478
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:31,141
[SPEAKER_08]: like a arcade champ type you know like a Billy Mitchell type character sort of but not you know this essentially like he was a big like oh I got a high score back in you know 89 but you know I'll really focus on that

479
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:46,489
[SPEAKER_08]: and just like you know the kid is a modder he's like kind of like a person that makes modded stuff in the game and I don't know who the other two people are yet or how they get there but essentially you know there's like

480
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:56,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow Steve gets into this Minecraft world and then he's kind of living there now and then they get in kind of the same way and now they have to get out at some point.

481
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:57,576
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I think it looks good.

482
00:41:57,596 --> 00:42:05,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would have preferred it to be animated, obviously, but it looks more interesting than what we initially saw.

483
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:10,123
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are still a lot of things that are like Uncanny Valley, kind of weird.

484
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:14,786
[SPEAKER_08]: But I trust that they'll do the best that they can with it.

485
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:16,367
[SPEAKER_08]: and we'll see.

486
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:19,208
[SPEAKER_08]: If it sucks, we'll just call it like it is, you know?

487
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yes, it's still animated.

488
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,371
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot computer animated in it.

489
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:24,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, technically true.

490
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:29,614
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wish it was fully computer animated instead of like green screen stuff for a lot of this.

491
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:29,854
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

492
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:52,861
[SPEAKER_08]: there are a lot of actual sets and stuff the behind the scenes stuff that they are talking about the work that's going into it with Weta and everything is very there's a lot of effort going in it's not just like, oh it's a quick cash grab they are really trying to do all this stuff and make it look great

493
00:42:53,345 --> 00:42:55,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, hopefully it turns out great.

494
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:57,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I will see it either way.

495
00:42:57,735 --> 00:42:58,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know what?

496
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,582
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like a lot of movies that you never know.

497
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:01,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, look at Sonic the Hedgehog.

498
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:02,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect example.

499
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:26,635
[SPEAKER_08]: when we first saw that I was like oh it's gonna be alright but it's a good movie like I've really enjoyed the last two movies and I'm looking forward to the third one I'm not even really a Sonic the Hedgehog fan I'm just aware of that franchise like I you know it wasn't one of the games I played it's too fast but it's I don't know it looks fun alright cool

500
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:28,870
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, my gaming week.

501
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, admittedly, a lot of the similar types of stuff I've been playing.

502
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV, I had another friend of mine that recently got into it.

503
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:38,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been, you know, buddying up, doing some dungeons and things like that.

504
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:40,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally hit my Black Mage, hit 100.

505
00:43:40,377 --> 00:43:42,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I've been working on that.

506
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, also been playing Diablo 4, even though I swore I was done with it.

507
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:48,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

508
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:49,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still very...

509
00:43:49,983 --> 00:43:50,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 4

510
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:27,465
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as other new games is played this week I gotta talk about Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 because that released this week and I don't know

511
00:44:29,147 --> 00:44:56,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not happy with the way it turned out and that really sucks to say because I want to like I loved Flight Simulator 2020 was so good like it was just so neat because you didn't have to know a lot about like flying the planes or anything there were these modes that would just throw you right into flying into certain areas and then like you would also it was very easy like it would come up on the screen like if you would just want to say like say I want to do like oh I want to fly from the Sacramento airport to

512
00:44:57,313 --> 00:44:58,594
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

513
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:44,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, wouldn't even work the first night because I guess the servers were getting slammed so hard because I know they lessened the amount of download in this game because I think a lot more of the assets are online than they were the first time I'm sure they're leaning more into the Azure streaming and all that stuff and of course you can never accurately predict the demand for that type of thing and those servers were slammed

514
00:45:45,063 --> 00:45:55,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to play it the next day at night and it takes a long time to load probably because it's downloading all of that data when you fire it up, whatever.

515
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:58,523
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

516
00:46:17,802 --> 00:46:39,282
[SPEAKER_03]: but then like I was trying to do the custom flight and I had a really hard time doing it and I couldn't even figure out how to get autopilot to take over for me like I'm sure it's very easy but it wasn't as easy or intuitive as it was in 2020 and then I was like well I think there's this whole mode where you can like get out of the plane and like walk around and I did that a little bit and it kind of

517
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's because I was trying to do it in my neighborhood.

518
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:47,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably more meant for foresty areas and mountain areas.

519
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:52,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look good in urban areas.

520
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:55,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the building information is just not all there.

521
00:46:55,386 --> 00:47:00,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I couldn't expect it to be there, but it kind of looked bad, to be quite honest.

522
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I tried to do a photo mode.

523
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the game...

524
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:15,358
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't really helping me on how to take a photo, even in the first mission, which is supposed to be easy to take a photo of the pyramids in Egypt and this whole thing.

525
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:18,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I'm going to be, I'm going to be 100% with y'all.

526
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,881
[SPEAKER_03]: 2020 was a better experience.

527
00:47:21,302 --> 00:47:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather just go back and play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

528
00:47:24,824 --> 00:47:25,785
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

529
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:42,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

530
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:00,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to say.

531
00:48:01,383 --> 00:48:13,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really disappointed because I feel like this studio makes good games and I feel like obviously you see the internet is just tearing them a new one over all the downtime that this game had with its launch and so forth.

532
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:23,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there's, you know, maybe people don't necessarily feel exactly the same way I do, but I think there are quite a few people that are saying, so what's really the upgrade over 2020?

533
00:48:27,745 --> 00:48:28,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp womp.

534
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:29,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

535
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:30,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, y'all.

536
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:32,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recommend it.

537
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:38,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you have Game Pass or cloud streaming, I mean, I guess it's, what do you have to lose?

538
00:48:39,328 --> 00:48:41,809
[SPEAKER_03]: But go play 2020.

539
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:51,231
[SPEAKER_03]: The maps are the same because the neighborhood I was trying to explore wasn't built in the 2020 maps.

540
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:52,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2024, it's still not built.

541
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so that's my thoughts on that.

542
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:05,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well with that we'll get into some more gaming news.

543
00:49:05,994 --> 00:49:13,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick housekeeping note, we will not be here on December 15th.

544
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:14,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be out of town, so I will not be here.

545
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:16,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So no show December 15th.

546
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:17,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after the Game Awards.

547
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:44,863
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry uh we're not sorry uh we will oh shit that means I can't do the broadcast Bobby was talking about earlier because that means that's the night of Thursday night is the night I fly out womp womp oh well I guess I'll catch up on all of that when I uh land we'll see well Loki you could do it Bobby if you're around or Jamie if you're around Thursday night you should do it yeah

548
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on to some gaming news.

549
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

550
00:49:49,739 --> 00:50:03,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so Sony is in talks to purchase the parent company of From Software, Tunesoft, and other companies under the subsidiary of Kadokawa Corporation.

551
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:09,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently this is definitely happening because Kadokawa has confirmed that

552
00:50:10,226 --> 00:50:39,063
[SPEAKER_08]: they have received an initial letter of intent to acquire the company's shares from Sony but they haven't made a decision regarding that if there are facts that should be announced in the future we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate manner so it's not like official official but all signs point to it's in the process I mean essentially that the intent from Sony has been Sony has said yes we would like to purchase you and they're like

553
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:41,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to think about it.

554
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,331
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S sounds very confident it won't happen in chat.

555
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:47,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we'll see.

556
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:51,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very, it's a much, this is much bigger than FromSoftware.

557
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:58,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand why Rama's commenting on this because this is, for the anime market, this is huge.

558
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:04,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and Sony has their hands in things beyond video games with entertainment and all of that.

559
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:05,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and Kadokawa,

560
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,862
[SPEAKER_03]: is, like, they don't just have from software, they have all these movies, anime, stuff.

561
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:35,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Anime, tourism, video streaming, Japanese game development, yeah, they have, like, Spike Chunsoft, which did Danganronpa, and Mystery Dungeon, also Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Acquire, who did, you know, it was co-developed Octopath Traveler, and just did development on Mario & Luigi Brothership,

562
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:44,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in like anime, you know, there's Doga Kobe, NG, Globovision and others, Anime News Network.

563
00:51:46,527 --> 00:52:12,898
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a lot, a lot of stuff Ranma in chat says if Sony does acquire Kadokawa, it would put Sony in a majority control of the anime industry there's probably going to be a lot of eyeballs on this, you know, again, I don't know what I'm not going to attempt to even know what antitrust laws in Japan look like but this merger, hardly any to my knowledge this merger might feel like it's almost too big, so I don't know we'll see yeah

564
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:34,520
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah um any thoughts though since you know a lot of gamers are looking at this from the from software standpoint and the you know the Spike Chunsoft and that as well any thoughts about that end of it what you know if if Sony acquiring from software kind of changes the game at all or anything like that

565
00:52:35,618 --> 00:52:38,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a big deal with the series here.

566
00:52:38,919 --> 00:52:48,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think we're going to see certainly none of the United States Congress or whatever is going to make a big deal about it, even though it is a big franchise or something.

567
00:52:49,944 --> 00:52:52,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly, would Sony be multi-platform with those?

568
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:53,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

569
00:52:55,227 --> 00:52:58,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee that they would.

570
00:52:58,148 --> 00:52:59,689
[SPEAKER_03]: PC, the ultimate multi-platform.

571
00:52:59,789 --> 00:52:59,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

572
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:10,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I mean, like, as, you know, and as Joe and Hunter Matt says, it makes me wonder if Sony just wants to buy part of the company, like Disney buying part of 20th Century Fox.

573
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

574
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:18,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But as to what part, I don't necessarily think it's the From Software part specifically.

575
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:18,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be.

576
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:22,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember, there's a lot of elements of Kadokawa that...

577
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:26,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be under negotiation here.

578
00:53:27,598 --> 00:53:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess it's easy to jump to the conclusion that Sony wants Elden Ring.

579
00:53:31,883 --> 00:53:34,105
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, From Software has kind of knocked it out of the park.

580
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:34,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like...

581
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:38,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like From Software has already done a lot for Sony.

582
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:47,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Between Bloodborne, between Demon's Souls and the re-release, they've done a lot for Sony that wasn't necessarily on Xbox in the first place.

583
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:53,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe this makes it a little more official, but I don't know if this really changes the game.

584
00:53:54,897 --> 00:54:12,012
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, Elden Ring was a huge title it was one huge title and I don't think it necessarily just because Sony acquires from software it necessarily shifts the balance of gaming as dramatically as Microsoft getting Activision you know what I mean?

585
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: and even Danganronpa these are all games that tend to perform better on PlayStation anyway I don't know, we'll see

586
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:22,723
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

587
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:27,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little bit with Ranma that I question if this actually happens.

588
00:54:27,486 --> 00:54:42,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's, yeah, either it's a portion of it they really want control over, but yeah, I just, I feel like the company that gets made out of both of these owning each other is just too, it's too much control, especially in the anime side of things.

589
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:48,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think, like, in the case of Activision, I know we were kind of rooting for that to happen before,

590
00:54:48,616 --> 00:54:59,463
[SPEAKER_08]: originally because we hated Bobby Kotek but like I think in general these companies that aren't necessarily in financial trouble

591
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:02,884
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't really need these acquisitions.

592
00:55:03,985 --> 00:55:12,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing good has come from this mass mergers of all these different companies into one giant company.

593
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:15,177
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have essentially less competition at that point.

594
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:20,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And while that benefits those corporations, it doesn't benefit the consumer.

595
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:40,489
[SPEAKER_03]: and we see what happens with that when large corporations have lots of money and then get in the pockets of politicians I don't expect the US government over the next four years to give a damn about any of this they have more racist things to do I think you're going to see tons of mergers just because the US government isn't going to fucking care um

596
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:42,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the sad reality.

597
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:48,518
[SPEAKER_03]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I think the anime and manga part is the bigger story and FromSoftware is an afterthought.

598
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:49,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree.

599
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:55,105
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of the gaming media and blogs and stuff are obviously focused on that part of it because it is an impact.

600
00:55:55,506 --> 00:55:59,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do agree with the – I think, yes, I think the reasons why it doesn't happen –

601
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:03,295
[SPEAKER_03]: is more on the anime and manga part than from software.

602
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, for sure.

603
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:11,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby says, it's just, will governments care about anime monopoly the same way they cared about game streaming monopolies?

604
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I think after January 20th, the US doesn't.

605
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:17,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

606
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:20,702
[SPEAKER_03]: um it's the U.S.

607
00:56:20,762 --> 00:56:34,891
[SPEAKER_03]: government will all all be about the rich getting richer yes it's gonna be the EU the EU will be the ones that that yeah Bobby points out the EU yeah I would agree with that the EU is gonna have to do something to to um change the game but we'll see

608
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:37,336
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

609
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:03,770
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

610
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:23,547
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

611
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:59,277
[SPEAKER_03]: and shit that probably works better on mobile um and yeah there's a little trailer that you can see about that and all that uh and you know other than that we don't know a lot else about it except in a follow-up interview with Famitsu Naoki Yoshida said

612
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:00,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free to play.

613
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:02,200
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no gotcha.

614
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:07,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But there will be outfits and mounts you can purchase on the in-game shops.

615
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a quote said, the monetization will be such that all players can enjoy the game for a long time.

616
00:58:14,793 --> 00:58:21,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I could also see that just building an awareness of Fama SE 14 and getting people hooked on it draws more people into it.

617
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:29,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see how this game will be any fun on a mobile platform when it's very action based however

618
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:40,600
[SPEAKER_03]: The clever thought I had was, what if they made Final Fantasy XIV a more traditional turn-based battle system?

619
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the mobile game we got.

620
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:44,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't do this to me.

621
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:50,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Final Fantasy XIV graphics, but the game plays like classic Final Fantasy.

622
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:53,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's where it ends up.

623
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking, I have an iPad, what's the problem?

624
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:08,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still hoping for Eleven, but I know that's never happening.

625
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:14,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but we know Eleven Mobile was in development at one point and then suddenly wasn't.

626
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:18,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is interesting that this is a thing now instead.

627
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:23,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So one could argue that maybe some of the things that they were looking at for Eleven are going to be for this.

628
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:23,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

629
00:59:24,237 --> 00:59:25,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to say.

630
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:25,619
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

631
00:59:29,157 --> 00:59:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: but we'll see you know details again are very light I'd like to see more about gameplay because if it's very action based and dodging you know the servers as it is in the game can sometimes you know people have trouble dodging things and stuff like that so I don't know how that translates to a mobile version of the game I really am rooting for something turn based I think it would I think yeah merge the awesome story of Final Fantasy 14 with classic Final Fantasy and I really think you'll have a winning formula

632
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,230
[SPEAKER_03]: but what do I know?

633
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:01,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a dummy with a podcast.

634
01:00:02,912 --> 01:00:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about other classic games.

635
01:00:04,613 --> 01:00:05,614
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what do you have?

636
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:26,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the producer for Dragon Quest 3 has made some interesting statements in an interview including wanting to see a remake of Final Fantasy 6 done in the same style that the Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D was done.

637
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:37,047
[SPEAKER_01]: He's quoted saying that they don't have concrete plans, but would love to say that the next one coming out would be Final Fantasy VI.

638
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:41,849
[SPEAKER_01]: But, of course, it's not official.

639
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:44,049
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing really solid in the work.

640
01:00:44,669 --> 01:00:47,530
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were very proud of Octopath Traveler.

641
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just the first in that style and wanted to keep going with it.

642
01:00:53,293 --> 01:00:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of with DarkTetsuya in chat who says, I wouldn't say no to Final Fantasy VI done in that style.

643
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I love Final Fantasy VI, don't get me wrong.

644
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:02,839
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had the pixel remasters.

645
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:04,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Just had that.

646
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:13,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say the opera scene felt very like it was lifted out of the...

647
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:16,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Octopath Traveler Engine.

648
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it didn't feel like you were in the pixel remaster.

649
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:19,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like it was a different thing.

650
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:21,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just weird to me.

651
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:26,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel like it's an offhanded comment the guy made that now like, you know, people are running everywhere.

652
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, Final Fantasy 6 Remastered.

653
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are running a little bit too wild with it.

654
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:32,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also kind of sitting here going and

655
01:01:33,516 --> 01:01:44,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know the history I've made on this program with my comments on the game Chrono Trigger, which is a game I like, but I feel a lot of people over-inflate it a bit, but that's my opinion.

656
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:47,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I can also sit here and say, you know what?

657
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:49,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time Chrono Trigger fans get their due.

658
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Remake Chrono Trigger already.

659
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Do Chrono Trigger in this engine.

660
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what people want.

661
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:55,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it to them.

662
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had Final Fantasy VI.

663
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:58,501
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need it again.

664
01:01:59,522 --> 01:02:00,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Do Chrono Trigger.

665
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:00,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

666
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:24,945
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where my brain is at but maybe he can't say that maybe it's easier for him to say Final Fantasy 6 because it's the furthest thing from what they would actually make right now maybe they are working on other types of games he just doesn't want to give the hints on that maybe Final Fantasy 6 was a easy thing for him to say because that would be the game they're least working on right now if that makes sense

667
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:44,258
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe it's all speculation that is a big part of it too but I think we'll continue to see this engine deliver us a few more remakes so Live Alive did really well I think so we'll see Mike Def says what Rob wants is a Super Metroid done in the Dread style no

668
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want another 2D Metroid.

669
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dread was fine.

670
01:02:50,955 --> 01:02:57,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't love how... I didn't love some of the survival elements of it, but it was good enough.

671
01:02:57,783 --> 01:02:58,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoyed it.

672
01:02:58,864 --> 01:02:59,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's that.

673
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:02,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

674
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:02,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

675
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:13,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so we have news now that the Xbox platform is going to allow you to have a little bit more freedom when it comes to streaming games.

676
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:19,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So originally, if you wanted to do the game streaming with xCloud, you had to have Game Pass Ultimate.

677
01:03:20,444 --> 01:03:26,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with Game Pass, of course, you are limited to the games that are in that library, which could change over time.

678
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:31,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And that doesn't necessarily allow you to stream games that say you have purchased.

679
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,891
[SPEAKER_08]: but that may be changing.

680
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:48,180
[SPEAKER_08]: So now they are testing something starting as of November 20th to allow people to be able to stream a limited number of games on Xbox if you own them.

681
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,982
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a list of 50 games so far.

682
01:03:51,582 --> 01:04:00,508
[SPEAKER_08]: The caveat right now is that it's not available in the Xbox PC app or on Xbox consoles but you can do it through the browser.

683
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so weird to me, by the way.

684
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:03,832
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's testing.

685
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:04,953
[SPEAKER_08]: They're testing it right now.

686
01:04:04,973 --> 01:04:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think they're rolling it out, maybe.

687
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:07,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

688
01:04:07,896 --> 01:04:10,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Why doesn't the app launch a browser window?

689
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:14,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a very easy bridge.

690
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:17,063
[SPEAKER_08]: PC apps on an Xbox?

691
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,644
[SPEAKER_08]: That's impossible.

692
01:04:18,784 --> 01:04:21,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Except it's a thing that it does.

693
01:04:22,427 --> 01:04:23,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But okay, okay.

694
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:24,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

695
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:26,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't make the apps, so maybe I just don't know.

696
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:30,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I launch Edge on the Xbox and stream through that?

697
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:41,839
[SPEAKER_03]: You can launch Edge on the Xbox I don't know if you can stream through it I would feel like it's a little too demanding but I haven't tried it but yes, you can use Edge there is a version of Microsoft Edge for the Xbox

698
01:04:43,049 --> 01:05:07,314
[SPEAKER_08]: but anyways, it does support a limited number of games some notable stuff, obviously the recent release Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 which is a couple years old at this point the Final Fantasy games, the Pixel remasters I'm assuming because it's 1 through 6

699
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:34,985
[SPEAKER_08]: and Hades Harry Potter Quidditch Champions Hogwarts Legacy although actually I'm sorry Hogwarts Legacy is on there as well yeah so it's a kind of a variety of different games that they're testing out right now and hopefully it expands to more later on yeah because I don't think I had a single game on the list I was like oh let me go see what game and I didn't have a single damn thing on the list

700
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know... I mean, I have all the Game Pass stuff.

701
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:39,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tested the classroom before.

702
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:39,567
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

703
01:05:39,587 --> 01:05:43,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's the future Game of the Year indie title, Baltros, on there.

704
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Hades.

705
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:46,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I bought on PlayStation.

706
01:05:46,172 --> 01:05:48,533
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and again, Hades on PlayStation.

707
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm not buying enough games on Xbox, so...

708
01:05:52,216 --> 01:06:15,341
[SPEAKER_03]: which honestly I don't actually to be real I don't remember the last time I bought a game on Xbox because it's all been Game Pass I think it would have been Forza Horizon yes uh no I don't even think I did that because of Game Pass or I literally I bought it outright yeah I bought it outright for what is before I had Game Pass it was on

709
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,361
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual console where... No, I'm sorry.

710
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:23,804
[SPEAKER_08]: The last game I bought on Xbox actually was Red Dead Redemption 2 for my son to play.

711
01:06:24,185 --> 01:06:36,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he... Well, I mean, his computer can run it too, but he thought it didn't run it, and so he was playing it on Xbox for a while, and then I finally was like, you know your PC probably can run that.

712
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:37,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, oh.

713
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:38,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

714
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:40,614
Funny.

715
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,291
[SPEAKER_08]: He's played through the whole campaign.

716
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:46,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of my kids, I am super proud of my kids when it comes to gaming.

717
01:06:46,112 --> 01:06:49,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's played through the whole campaign of Red Dead Redemption 2 already once.

718
01:06:50,014 --> 01:06:52,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And then now he's playing it again modded on the PC.

719
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:59,338
[SPEAKER_08]: My other son, my youngest son, is beat Mario Kart 8 completely.

720
01:06:59,618 --> 01:07:02,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like completely decimated that game.

721
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:02,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And now is...

722
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:10,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to get good at all the strats to get at the top of the leaderboards in time trials.

723
01:07:10,912 --> 01:07:13,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like in top 11 on some of these.

724
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:14,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just ridiculous.

725
01:07:15,842 --> 01:07:16,263
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

726
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,130
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

727
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:20,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

728
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:31,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about if we talk about Microsoft Cloud, let's talk about the Sony Cloud and let's talk about what is happening there because some interesting updates there as well.

729
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:36,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And cloud testing or cloud streaming testing has started.

730
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:39,241
[SPEAKER_03]: on the PlayStation Portal.

731
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that device that came out some time ago and some people were like, well, it would be nice if we actually got actual cloud gaming on this thing.

732
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:49,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

733
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,193
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get your wish.

734
01:07:51,294 --> 01:07:53,537
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have PlayStation Plus Premium...

735
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:56,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to have their version of Game Pass, basically.

736
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,002
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow you to access 120 PlayStation 5 titles instantly.

737
01:08:01,983 --> 01:08:06,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you have a PlayStation Portal, it might be a nice little like, ooh, new feature unlocked, apparently.

738
01:08:06,987 --> 01:08:09,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a cool little thing that they have put out there.

739
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:15,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Control is one of the games you can play, and apparently they run pretty well on the device.

740
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So, neat.

741
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:23,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess cloud gaming really is the future in some ways.

742
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like too, especially with portable devices.

743
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:27,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't you have both?

744
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:29,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see why not.

745
01:08:29,955 --> 01:08:34,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I think portable devices still feel very limited too.

746
01:08:34,498 --> 01:08:38,661
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really go outside with them because they need Wi-Fi to work.

747
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:39,582
[SPEAKER_03]: But

748
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:53,853
[SPEAKER_03]: As 5G, I feel, but I feel like I've been saying this for way too long and maybe I'm just like, but I, you know, as 5G gets more and more out there, it will be easier to do when you're not stuck in your house.

749
01:08:54,393 --> 01:08:58,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel, again, I feel like I've been saying that for a long time now and it still hasn't happened.

750
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

751
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on.

752
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, E3VL in chat says, I worry about latency.

753
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:09,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It would really depend on the game you're playing, right?

754
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:12,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, again, a game we've talked about a lot tonight, Bellatro.

755
01:09:12,673 --> 01:09:14,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Latency won't fucking matter in that game.

756
01:09:14,814 --> 01:09:16,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really depends on the game you're playing, I'm sure.

757
01:09:17,055 --> 01:09:25,978
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like people that have been playing this thing are, you know, a lot of the cloud stuff is getting better at, like, kind of predicting in advance what you might be doing.

758
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it helps with...

759
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:53,929
[SPEAKER_03]: the streaming is it actually tries to figure out different permutations of the game at once this is very interesting how it all works but yeah anyway moving on we'll talk about something a little older DarkSakura well a little older and maybe pretty new so there is going to be a new port for Atari 7800 plus it is

760
01:09:58,711 --> 01:10:22,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Bounty Bob Strikes Back which is a sequel to Port of the Miner or Port of the Miner 2049er there we go I can't make words happen it is Miner 2049er sequel Bounty Bob Strikes Back I can read, I swear it's also kind of a tongue twister name

761
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: blah blah blah blah blah it was a pretty influential platform game it was done by Bill Hogue and Big Five Software where you play a bounty named Bounty Bob going through Nuclear Ned's Uranium Mine to look for a criminal named Yukon Johan so you have to avoid enemies and stuff and traps and things on the game but now

762
01:10:53,132 --> 01:10:54,537
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a sequel.

763
01:10:55,179 --> 01:10:55,782
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it.

764
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:58,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the...

765
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:05,682
[SPEAKER_01]: The original was, I believe, was it a 5200 game?

766
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:06,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it was.

767
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:14,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that sequel did come out originally for the Atari 8-bit computers and did come on Atari 5200.

768
01:11:15,448 --> 01:11:18,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum.

769
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:25,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is going to be a 7800 homebrew being developed by Robert DiCrescenzo.

770
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:27,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can play it on the 7800 and the Atari 2600+.

771
01:11:29,756 --> 01:11:41,467
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a physical copy for about $30 and it will come with the cartridge and box artwork from Kat Hudson and a cartridge sleeve and a printed manual.

772
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,251
[SPEAKER_03]: We love all that fancy stuff.

773
01:11:46,491 --> 01:11:47,432
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Ninja Golf?

774
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:50,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually, Ninja Golf is getting republished.

775
01:11:50,635 --> 01:11:51,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy.

776
01:11:52,083 --> 01:12:09,850
[SPEAKER_01]: well okay hold on hold on hold on sidestep sidestep this is from last month but i didn't see this okay that's fine uh actually two months ago r-type running on a 70 did i cover this r-type running on a 7800 i don't recall i need this in my life

777
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:23,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, I feel like these Atari cartridges and homebrew, a lot of this has been growing because of the release of the 2600 Plus and these newer devices that are meant to play the older games.

778
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like we have new things to make cartridges for.

779
01:12:26,782 --> 01:12:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to try to find a 7800 at a flea market or hope you still have a working one in a vault somewhere.

780
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:34,966
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get a new device to play these.

781
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:36,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's R-Type or minor...

782
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Bounty Bob back.

783
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:48,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whether it's that, it's, you know, there's a place to play it very easily.

784
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:49,433
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fun.

785
01:12:52,094 --> 01:12:55,236
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, did you get quiet because you're ordering that R-type cartridge?

786
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:57,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find it.

787
01:12:58,257 --> 01:12:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's out yet.

788
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:01,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a 7800 in your vault?

789
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:05,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you're asking me if I have the 7800.

790
01:13:05,741 --> 01:13:06,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to ask.

791
01:13:08,846 --> 01:13:12,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely there's some things you don't have that people would assume you have.

792
01:13:13,631 --> 01:13:15,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere I have one.

793
01:13:15,113 --> 01:13:16,635
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

794
01:13:16,695 --> 01:13:18,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I should rephrase my question.

795
01:13:18,757 --> 01:13:21,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know where your Atari 7800 is?

796
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of do.

797
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:25,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 10 o'clock.

798
01:13:25,304 --> 01:13:26,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know where your Atari 7800 is?

799
01:13:30,084 --> 01:13:53,675
[SPEAKER_01]: uh the 50 and probably some with the 5200s so we have two 5200s the four port and the two port version that's a good that's a good bumper we had to do in the future it's 10 o'clock do you know where your atari 7800 is like animate my uh my virtual boy going for a walk and just bumping into it on an illicit uh you know alleyway hallway deal i'll just find a picture of the vault in your old house

800
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:56,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's not hard.

801
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've sent you a few of them.

802
01:13:58,152 --> 01:13:59,593
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a YouTube of it at some point.

803
01:13:59,613 --> 01:14:00,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably still on the channel.

804
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, there's very few YouTubes I've removed.

805
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:08,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a TikTok up of the garage right now, but actually from like a year ago.

806
01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:19,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I would still encourage people to go watch that TikTok of your garage because I think when we talk about like your pinball hobby, I don't think people really understand what that means.

807
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:21,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hobby with a capital H.

808
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:50,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if I can find it but it's like it's just like you know that's that's honestly that's really Dan's thing but at the same time you know I love it too I mean I'm I'm always gonna encourage him and I told him in no uncertain uh terms that he could not get rid of Ghostbusters he was trying to get rid of Ghostbusters traded out from under me and I'm like no that's in here I thought World Cup 94 was the not over my dead body thing

809
01:14:51,337 --> 01:14:53,519
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the absolute no way.

810
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,121
[SPEAKER_01]: That and Theater of Magic.

811
01:14:58,963 --> 01:15:02,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Theater of Magic though is not a good one for tournament play I realized.

812
01:15:04,507 --> 01:15:06,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I found one of me playing Doctor Who.

813
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:07,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Me playing Beatles.

814
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the Metallica that got modified to play the Nyan Cat music.

815
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:16,055
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.

816
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,036
[SPEAKER_01]: That's California Extreme.

817
01:15:17,932 --> 01:15:23,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's go ahead and move on and we'll talk to Loki.

818
01:15:23,173 --> 01:15:24,073
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have for us?

819
01:15:25,294 --> 01:15:43,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so Steam has some new rules protecting consumers from unsavory corporations who would like to sell you that DLC and those game passes on promises and hopes and, you know, sometimes that doesn't materialize and you're like, ah, dang it.

820
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:44,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid all this money.

821
01:15:45,118 --> 01:15:45,999
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I to do?

822
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now they are going to actually hold those companies to that.

823
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So it says by offering a season pass, you are promising future content.

824
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:03,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the process of launching a season pass, you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the season pass.

825
01:16:04,303 --> 01:16:08,984
[SPEAKER_08]: That launch timing is a commitment to both the consumers and Steam.

826
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:20,736
[SPEAKER_08]: If you aren't ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC and when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn't offer a season pass on Steam.

827
01:16:21,157 --> 01:16:29,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they break that promise with their roadmaps or whatever, the customers may automatically be refunded for that DLC.

828
01:16:30,728 --> 01:16:32,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a nice thing that they're doing.

829
01:16:33,391 --> 01:16:37,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Steam being more consumer-friendly as time goes on.

830
01:16:37,896 --> 01:16:42,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not get Half-Life 3, but at least they're making a good marketplace on PC.

831
01:16:42,742 --> 01:16:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure there's some corners that are going to be pretty unhappy with this news, especially in the development front.

832
01:16:47,187 --> 01:16:48,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Too fucking bad.

833
01:16:48,569 --> 01:16:50,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I say too fucking bad as well, because...

834
01:16:51,372 --> 01:16:53,514
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially these additions.

835
01:16:53,654 --> 01:17:01,621
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really, it feels like it's really targeting these $100 game additions, these big game additions trying to, you know, buy it now and get the season pass, all this stuff.

836
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:02,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have seen it happen.

837
01:17:02,682 --> 01:17:06,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Kickstarters that promise a product that's then never delivered on.

838
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:17,835
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I think this is a great way for Steam to hold these things accountable, that if you sell something, you're not selling something that doesn't exist or concepts of a plan.

839
01:17:18,596 --> 01:17:20,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate that I went there.

840
01:17:20,597 --> 01:17:21,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

841
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:29,521
[SPEAKER_03]: That's literally what these gaming companies try to sell you sometimes to get a little more money out of your pocket is that they sell you concepts of a plan and then it never materializes.

842
01:17:30,182 --> 01:17:32,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad Steam says, you know what?

843
01:17:32,823 --> 01:17:38,266
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't produce, then the money goes back to them and it comes out of your check.

844
01:17:38,786 --> 01:17:39,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

845
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:44,172
[SPEAKER_08]: If a publisher intends to deliver on what they're promising, there's nothing to worry about.

846
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:44,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

847
01:18:04,617 --> 01:18:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: SS2100 Matt says, too many devs treat season passes as down payments.

848
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that down payment doesn't pay for the DLC, then they won't do it.

849
01:18:12,483 --> 01:18:13,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sucks.

850
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:14,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So good guy, Steam.

851
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:14,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

852
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:19,668
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and again, I know people are going to say, but the cost of making video games is so expensive.

853
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,969
[SPEAKER_03]: No one forced you to make that DLC.

854
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly, like I get it.

855
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:24,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Three words.

856
01:18:24,611 --> 01:18:25,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Three words.

857
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:27,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Baldur's Gate 3.

858
01:18:27,053 --> 01:18:27,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

859
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:33,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

860
01:18:34,496 --> 01:18:43,502
[SPEAKER_08]: If your company is reliant on that DLC prepayment in order to function, then I don't think you have a good business model.

861
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:56,152
[SPEAKER_08]: DLC is supposed to be, okay, we ship the game, the game is done, hey, the game's getting a lot of support, let's put some more content their way, and you start up that whole process.

862
01:18:56,552 --> 01:19:02,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only should it be cheaper to develop, because you've already developed the base game, you're just adding content at that point,

863
01:19:02,597 --> 01:19:08,004
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, it shouldn't be that, oh, well, we can't finish this game if we don't sell this DLC.

864
01:19:08,124 --> 01:19:10,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, then what are you doing?

865
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:22,116
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, moving on, let's talk about, before we get to our classic game of the week, let's talk about kind of a larger phenomenon outside of gaming.

866
01:19:22,316 --> 01:19:30,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've made it no secret here on this program that I have fucking hated X, and specifically the owner of that platform, Elon Musk, for quite some time.

867
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:36,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever since he started his anti-trans bullshit, I said, you know what, this is not a place I want to support anymore.

868
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:38,025
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

869
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:56,421
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

870
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:37,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Mastodon also an alternative Threads also an alternative but I think a reason why Blue Sky is sticking is because it feels like what Twitter felt like in 2015 probably because do you know where Blue Sky came from?

871
01:20:38,949 --> 01:20:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter in 2015

872
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it was and that's where the controversy of Jack being involved was because technically it was a spinoff from Twitter when Jack was involved and he is no longer involved, by the way, as a big public breakup, because Jack is actually

873
01:20:59,219 --> 01:20:59,539
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura,

874
01:21:17,091 --> 01:21:17,952
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX.COM XBOX.COM XBOX.COM

875
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:49,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom has a variety of accounts there most of the big AAA gaming studios and the indie developers are starting to show up on Blue Sky but the question is without an algorithm

876
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,749
[SPEAKER_03]: How are people going to get their things noticed on Blue Sky?

877
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:59,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, and this is one reason people like Blue Sky, there is no algorithm to carry you.

878
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:09,755
[SPEAKER_03]: There are custom algorithms and there's other ways with reblogging and stuff and different types of custom feeds to get noticed, but it's going to be a very different ballgame over on Blue Sky.

879
01:22:09,775 --> 01:22:13,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Blue Sky has starter packs and things to that note.

880
01:22:13,516 --> 01:22:17,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say GameDeveloper.com, which is more of an industry sort of

881
01:22:18,018 --> 01:22:22,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Online Magazine, we'll say, really took a deep dive on this subject.

882
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a very long kind of look into, you know, why are developers going to blue sky?

883
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And by their own words here, as at a glance, what happened here

884
01:22:33,487 --> 01:22:35,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Game developers are also leaving X for Blue Sky.

885
01:22:36,509 --> 01:22:40,873
[SPEAKER_03]: X was a critical hub for game developers to market games, network, and share creative ideas.

886
01:22:41,393 --> 01:22:46,036
[SPEAKER_03]: But folks hope that Blue Sky is going to recreate that experience, minus hate speech and Nazis.

887
01:22:46,497 --> 01:22:51,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is pretty much why all of us are re-rolling on Blue Sky right now, because we're sick of that shit.

888
01:22:52,221 --> 01:22:54,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it goes for game developers as well.

889
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go a little deeper.

890
01:22:56,624 --> 01:23:01,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to read to you some things that game developers are actually saying on Blue Sky.

891
01:23:02,587 --> 01:23:12,012
[SPEAKER_03]: One developer, Andrew Eich, I hope I said that right, who goes by BuddingMonkey, said, "...I joined almost exactly one year ago, mostly to see what's going on in the early days.

892
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:17,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It quickly evolved here from a place that felt like a refuge from Twitter to a full community with its own ethos."

893
01:23:18,496 --> 01:23:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter has become exclusively vitrolic political dialogue.

894
01:23:22,559 --> 01:23:24,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It has no more space for complete humans.

895
01:23:27,122 --> 01:23:27,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

896
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to cross stitch.

897
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You know those little cross stitches people make and hang in their bathrooms of these like great quotes and phrases?

898
01:23:36,309 --> 01:23:37,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That is too good.

899
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:41,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter has become exclusively vitrolic political dialogue.

900
01:23:41,493 --> 01:23:44,676
[SPEAKER_03]: It has no more space for complete humans.

901
01:23:45,276 --> 01:23:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: That is such a good read.

902
01:23:50,118 --> 01:23:51,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, continuing on.

903
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss having conversations with other developers about the craft of making games.

904
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss learning from other developers.

905
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:02,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss being able to talk directly to fans in a digestible format.

906
01:24:03,082 --> 01:24:06,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Sky gives me hope that we can have a community again.

907
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to another developer, Gwen Katz, who wrote some comments here on Blue Sky.

908
01:24:15,214 --> 01:24:26,696
[SPEAKER_03]: With the collapse of arts journalism, crowdfunding scaling drastically back, and most traditional publishers canning their promotional budgets, social media is essentially the only avenue remaining for creators to find an audience.

909
01:24:27,157 --> 01:24:30,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter was once vastly the most successful platform for this.

910
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:37,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But once Twitter stripped the blue checks from verified accounts, the handwriting was on the wall.

911
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:39,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was need for an alternative.

912
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a good read.

913
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Several competitors failed to take off for various reasons.

914
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:45,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-host Hive, Spoutable.

915
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:46,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I never heard of Spoutable.

916
01:24:47,323 --> 01:24:50,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Sky avoided those pitfalls and seems poised to fill the Twitter niche.

917
01:24:51,404 --> 01:24:59,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Sky has proved to be an excellent tool for networking and building an audience thanks to starter packs, feeds, and not penalizing links and images.

918
01:24:59,587 --> 01:25:03,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it works well for actual conversation remains to be seen, though.

919
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:17,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I do want to, you know, just kind of point you to this game developer article that goes, you know, really deeply in it, but it's basically a lot of people kind of, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like the voices of game developers kind of validating why the rest of us jump ship.

920
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:19,140
[SPEAKER_03]: We are tired of...

921
01:25:20,678 --> 01:25:24,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-complete human voices being elevated on the other platform.

922
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is refreshing on Blue Sky.

923
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And Blue Sky is not a perfect platform.

924
01:25:29,361 --> 01:25:32,202
[SPEAKER_03]: As it is exponentially growing, it is going to have growing pains.

925
01:25:32,522 --> 01:25:34,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to have moderation problems.

926
01:25:34,243 --> 01:25:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: There are going to be things that come up.

927
01:25:36,624 --> 01:25:44,386
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you have to look at who do you trust more right now to fore edge your social media platform?

928
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you trust Elon Musk?

929
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:46,467
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

930
01:25:48,331 --> 01:25:50,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you trust Jay and the Blue Sky team?

931
01:25:51,093 --> 01:25:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, while it hasn't always been perfect, I feel like she is, for the most part, making better calls.

932
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:08,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust that Blue Sky's... I feel like a platform that's actually trying to listen, as opposed to, well, I've decided we don't need blocking anymore, so we're just getting rid of it.

933
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:12,070
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a key difference between the two platforms.

934
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:13,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway...

935
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:17,427
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL was asking in chat, what is a starter pack?

936
01:26:17,787 --> 01:26:25,009
[SPEAKER_03]: A starter pack is basically, think of it as a glorified form of a list, a list of accounts that you can follow with one touch of a button.

937
01:26:25,409 --> 01:26:31,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, oh, you're getting this pack and Bobby actually linked to, we actually have a VOG Network starter pack.

938
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:34,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So at vognetwork.com has a starter pack.

939
01:26:34,871 --> 01:26:36,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you follow that starter pack, you will get

940
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Bog Network, me, Loki, Jamie, Bobby, Anime Jam Session, their hosts, British... I don't think British Invaders is on Blue Sky yet, but probably before too long.

941
01:26:47,777 --> 01:26:54,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and some of our longest and most vocal supporters whose voices have crafted these shows over the years.

942
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people like SSJ100Matt, Deft, you know, people that are like, you know...

943
01:26:59,975 --> 01:27:02,556
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a voice around here, even if not formally on a show.

944
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:04,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis Donovan's on there, too.

945
01:27:04,797 --> 01:27:10,498
[SPEAKER_03]: People that used to have a show, PodCulture, I believe, is on that pack, too, are also there.

946
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:12,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can follow all of us with just one touch of a button.

947
01:27:13,499 --> 01:27:15,880
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that's a lot of people.

948
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:18,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, Bobby.

949
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:23,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there are some footnotes as to why maybe not everybody is in the pack.

950
01:27:23,663 --> 01:27:23,923
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

951
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:56,156
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think it's a lot but I like the idea of the different tabs the different custom feeds because like being able to put all that side by side and by the way if you were pissed that Elon Musk got rid of TweetDeck guess what go to the website deck.blue it's literally TweetDeck for blue sky it's great for those of you that like to have four or five feeds on display at once it's a great application deck.blue great anyway

952
01:27:57,335 --> 01:28:02,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that's a little bit about the real world and how it is affecting game developers as well.

953
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, being able to access your favorite game developers used to be a great thing and then it turned into a cesspool and maybe it can be a great thing again.

954
01:28:11,758 --> 01:28:12,178
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

955
01:28:12,978 --> 01:28:21,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's travel back to a simpler time when if you wanted to contact your favorite game developer, you had to write a letter and put it in the mail.

956
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to the classic game of the week with this bumper.

957
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:43,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

958
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:46,192
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

959
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:53,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week this week?

960
01:28:54,478 --> 01:29:16,085
[SPEAKER_01]: In the spirit of Thanksgiving and hunting turkeys and mayhem and shenanigans I chose South Park for Nintendo 64 It was not a good game It was not on my bingo card of games DarkSakura would pick

961
01:29:17,532 --> 01:29:20,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what has turkeys in it and is really annoying?

962
01:29:20,274 --> 01:29:21,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that game exists.

963
01:29:21,835 --> 01:29:22,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair.

964
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:38,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it is a first-person shooter game based on South Park, developed by Iguana Entertainment using a modified version of the engine that was used in Turok 2 Seeds of Evil.

965
01:29:38,524 --> 01:29:39,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're the same publisher, so whatever.

966
01:29:40,766 --> 01:30:03,509
[SPEAKER_01]: um it was released for Nintendo 64 in 1998 and for Windows in 1999 in uh Europe and uh it came out later PlayStation port came out later too developed by Appaloosa Interactive and it was that last release was meant to coincide with South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut the movie

967
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:20,123
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the Nintendo 64 version was not well liked I'm just going to throw that out there PC and Playstation versions were received quite a bit better but there were other games that came out and they were kind of received the same way

968
01:30:20,763 --> 01:30:25,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, you play one of the four boys, Cartman, Kyle, Stan, or Kenny.

969
01:30:26,924 --> 01:30:30,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to defeat enemies with different weapons that you find.

970
01:30:30,585 --> 01:30:32,566
[SPEAKER_01]: You start off with snowballs, I think, yeah.

971
01:30:33,326 --> 01:30:42,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And after you complete your levels, you have to fight against large enemies with a tank.

972
01:30:43,368 --> 01:30:52,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you don't win, then you have to defend South Park from other tanks in a minigame called Penalty Round.

973
01:30:53,595 --> 01:30:55,957
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a multiplayer head-to-head mode.

974
01:30:57,038 --> 01:30:59,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some people who found value in that.

975
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:09,108
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 version, when you reach select stages in player mode, you get a code for it.

976
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:15,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can put those into Cheesy Poof's decoder and get additional characters for head-to-head play.

977
01:31:15,954 --> 01:31:16,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's neat.

978
01:31:18,756 --> 01:31:23,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, yeah, on the Nintendo 64 version, you can choose between 20 characters and 17 multiplayer levels.

979
01:31:24,339 --> 01:31:29,602
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the PlayStation, only two players can play and are limited to six multiplayer levels and 20 characters.

980
01:31:30,942 --> 01:31:40,107
[SPEAKER_01]: The Windows version gives you four new levels titled Mustard Block, Sartendipity, oh, got it, Tabindance, and Soman Go.

981
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:41,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh...

982
01:31:42,506 --> 01:31:46,630
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have four extra characters you can play, which is Shelly, Satan, Jesus, and Santa.

983
01:31:47,551 --> 01:31:48,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

984
01:31:50,494 --> 01:31:55,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So the story of the game is that this comet is approaching the Earth, and...

985
01:31:56,545 --> 01:32:16,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It is basically concentrated evil, and the closer it gets, the more South Park is attacked, including rabid mutant turkeys, weird clones of the townspeople, aliens, crazy robots, sentient killer toys.

986
01:32:17,953 --> 01:32:21,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is up to Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.

987
01:32:22,855 --> 01:32:23,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

988
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:32,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's for them to investigate and save everything, thanks to a warning by Chef who got the fuck out of Dodge.

989
01:32:33,126 --> 01:32:37,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it really overall just was not well received.

990
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:49,810
[SPEAKER_01]: For all game, the PlayStation version got two stars, the N64 version got two and a half stars, and the PC version got four stars.

991
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:51,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, three and a half, my bad.

992
01:32:55,161 --> 01:33:00,343
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically saying that it starts off kind of funny and then gets really repetitive and that's about it.

993
01:33:03,965 --> 01:33:09,167
[SPEAKER_01]: GameSpot was saying that it's proof that a good license and good graphics aren't enough to sell a game.

994
01:33:10,147 --> 01:33:13,488
[SPEAKER_01]: But the voice acting, it was done by the original voice actors.

995
01:33:16,789 --> 01:33:18,610
[SPEAKER_01]: There were just so many complaints about it.

996
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:20,591
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean...

997
01:33:22,449 --> 01:33:35,862
[SPEAKER_01]: IGN said it was just as funny as watching the show, and GameSpot said that the Nintendo 64 version doesn't have very good level design, but it makes sense with the license.

998
01:33:36,142 --> 01:33:36,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

999
01:33:37,304 --> 01:33:38,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was commercially successful.

1000
01:33:40,106 --> 01:33:45,832
[SPEAKER_01]: By June 1999, the N64 version shipped nearly 1 million units worldwide.

1001
01:33:46,332 --> 01:33:52,018
[SPEAKER_01]: and by October 1999 it has sold well over 1 million units.

1002
01:33:52,258 --> 01:33:54,080
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one was nearly 1 million units.

1003
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were sequels that were cancelled.

1004
01:33:57,923 --> 01:34:00,546
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one that was tentatively called South Park 2.

1005
01:34:01,567 --> 01:34:07,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It was announced when they released the first game with a 2000 release date but it was cancelled.

1006
01:34:08,593 --> 01:34:18,659
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they focused on cheaper and simpler releases including South Park Chef's Love Shack in 1999 and South Park Rally in 2000.

1007
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:28,225
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another follow-up kind of a sandbox adventure game that was in development for PS2, GameCube and Xbox but it was unfinished and unreleased.

1008
01:34:30,366 --> 01:34:43,276
[SPEAKER_01]: they really didn't know anything about it until a build of it was found on an Xbox dev kit no playable version out as far as I know but there's footage out there so you can watch that if you're interested but yeah

1009
01:34:44,899 --> 01:34:45,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Mutant Turkeys.

1010
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:47,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Go throw snowballs at them.

1011
01:34:48,261 --> 01:34:48,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Save your town.

1012
01:34:50,022 --> 01:34:50,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Turkey Day.

1013
01:34:50,783 --> 01:34:53,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy the extremely mediocre draw distance.

1014
01:34:55,126 --> 01:34:55,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

1015
01:34:57,127 --> 01:35:00,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this was N64 before the RAM cart.

1016
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:02,311
[SPEAKER_03]: For its time, this was amazing.

1017
01:35:02,371 --> 01:35:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.

1018
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:02,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It was alright.

1019
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:03,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

1020
01:35:13,382 --> 01:35:17,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had been somewhere where this was being played and it kind of bored me.

1021
01:35:18,564 --> 01:35:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: But the evil turkeys are hilarious and so I figured that was apropos of the season.

1022
01:35:24,287 --> 01:35:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very timely pick and not just because a classic game of the week is denoted as a classic game of the week doesn't mean we're endorsing it as a good game.

1023
01:35:33,751 --> 01:35:37,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes games are classic because of how bad they were.

1024
01:35:37,793 --> 01:35:42,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a notable impact because it was wasn't this the first South Park game?

1025
01:35:42,375 --> 01:36:11,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was and you know again in the late 90s South Park was huge it's kind of it's strange to me that it's still going it's like the Simpsons I barely hear about it anymore unless like you know Milhouse's voice actress retires or something like that but like otherwise I'm always shocked they're still going because they don't feel like they have that same cultural impact they had in the 90s you know I think the last episode I actually watched was the DDR one oh god I watched the World of Warcraft one yeah

1026
01:36:12,219 --> 01:36:40,260
[SPEAKER_03]: but the one I always remember most is Chinpokomon for me it was Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride which again that one was great and for it's you know with as much as you know some people point out how South Park is problematic whatever I will say that that particular episode was actually hugely ahead of its time for how LGBT you know issues were being portrayed on TV at the time so you know it's just interesting so

1027
01:36:41,689 --> 01:36:43,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I found something I'm kind of interested in.

1028
01:36:43,491 --> 01:36:43,852
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

1029
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:48,537
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new Mado Monogatari game coming out in Japan.

1030
01:36:52,442 --> 01:36:53,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the series that spawned P.O.P.O.

1031
01:36:55,362 --> 01:36:55,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1032
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:57,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And a new Snow Brothers game.

1033
01:36:58,284 --> 01:36:58,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1034
01:36:58,464 --> 01:37:01,765
[SPEAKER_03]: S2100 Matt in chat says, I remember loving this game as a kid more than it deserved.

1035
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:06,368
[SPEAKER_03]: While it was funny, it was tough to complete the tasks on stages because it was so easy to get lost.

1036
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:08,289
[SPEAKER_03]: The cheats for this were funny.

1037
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:10,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And he links us to a cheats page.

1038
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when video games had cheats and not DLC?

1039
01:37:14,269 --> 01:37:15,049
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still cheats.

1040
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:15,730
[SPEAKER_01]: There are.

1041
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:18,811
[SPEAKER_01]: They just find out about them 10 years later.

1042
01:37:19,611 --> 01:37:24,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the Game Awards will nominate a cheat as a Game of the Year some year.

1043
01:37:24,212 --> 01:37:29,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe the Game Awards will nominate the cheat from a Homestar Runner video game someday.

1044
01:37:29,654 --> 01:37:31,455
[SPEAKER_03]: The cheat.

1045
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:32,155
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one.

1046
01:37:32,195 --> 01:37:32,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one.

1047
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:34,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Telltale did one some time back.

1048
01:37:35,436 --> 01:37:39,057
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also the card game.

1049
01:37:39,558 --> 01:37:40,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

1050
01:37:41,636 --> 01:37:41,876
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1051
01:37:41,996 --> 01:37:42,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a danger.

1052
01:37:42,917 --> 01:37:44,019
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dangerous game.

1053
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:46,341
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1054
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:52,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's travel around and check out some other news from the gaming world in rapid fire news.

1055
01:37:52,228 --> 01:37:52,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1056
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:54,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1057
01:37:54,690 --> 01:38:00,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to be getting a new Horizons and Zero Dawn Lego set.

1058
01:38:02,318 --> 01:38:06,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually have the first one, the Tall Neck set, which was released a while back.

1059
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:22,965
[SPEAKER_08]: As part of, I want to say it was a LEGO Idea set, but now with LEGO Horizon Adventures out, there is the new Shell Walker and also, oh yeah, it's Alloy and Barl versus Shell Walker and Sawtooth.

1060
01:38:23,745 --> 01:38:27,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to cost $45 for an 800-piece set.

1061
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:29,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be coming out March 1st.

1062
01:38:30,558 --> 01:38:30,919
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all right.

1063
01:38:31,019 --> 01:38:31,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have room for it.

1064
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:38,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize how fucking huge like this whole artisan Lego thing was getting until I went to Target yesterday.

1065
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:41,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, they have all the Legos and lock boxes there.

1066
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:44,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But like half of the aisle... Oh, weird.

1067
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all of them are like that, yeah.

1068
01:38:45,598 --> 01:38:45,918
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1069
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:08,013
[SPEAKER_03]: For the podcast people, Loki just held it up on the camera that he built that.

1070
01:39:08,113 --> 01:39:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's all of us who grew up on Lego that are now like in our 40s.

1071
01:39:12,715 --> 01:39:16,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I have anxiety and I need something to calm my brain.

1072
01:39:16,516 --> 01:39:20,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like, here, why don't you build a cat out of over a thousand Legos?

1073
01:39:22,182 --> 01:39:39,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the flowers are very popular as well, and they have so many sets of those, and they've even expanded out now to... I see it now where they have, like, Disney-inspired flower sets that also have, like, kind of a, you know, going a little bit old school here, Polly Pocket-style, like, fold-open, like...

1074
01:39:41,264 --> 01:39:41,484
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

1075
01:40:00,451 --> 01:40:27,125
[SPEAKER_08]: it's essentially like I saw one that they had it was like the old like night set someone's done like you know of course also the Lego ideas stuff is a big program and you basically go design sets they have free apps you can get out there to just build stuff with virtual Legos and then you create that set or what up on the website if it gets 10,000 votes they consider it you know as possibly something they release so it's pretty crazy

1076
01:40:27,645 --> 01:40:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1077
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:34,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the flowers got big in 2020 when everyone was home and adults were buying Lego for something to do.

1078
01:40:34,547 --> 01:40:40,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I recall correctly, Mrs. Blackwolf has a few of those sets set up around y'all's house.

1079
01:40:40,888 --> 01:40:41,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember from being there.

1080
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:43,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not knocking it.

1081
01:40:43,889 --> 01:40:44,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just surprised.

1082
01:40:44,749 --> 01:40:47,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little taken aback at how big it's gotten.

1083
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:53,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, I didn't realize we have an entire aisle at Target dedicated to this now.

1084
01:40:53,731 --> 01:40:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But even I was going, well, should we buy the cat?

1085
01:40:56,372 --> 01:40:56,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1086
01:40:57,557 --> 01:41:16,515
[SPEAKER_03]: but then I realized I have a it's not Lego but it's a knockoff brand whoever has the Pokemon license because it's not Lego I have a squirtle that I bought at Target ironically enough waiting to be constructed in the other room and until I build that no more Legos so

1087
01:41:17,116 --> 01:41:32,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and they've got, like, I mean, every time I go there now, they have the Super Mario World Mario Riding Yoshi set that you can animate with a crank that keeps calling my name, and I'm like, eh.

1088
01:41:32,265 --> 01:41:41,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, like, the Minecraft crafting table set, which it's the, like, micro versions of it, and I really don't like those.

1089
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:45,312
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I look at it and I'm like, eh.

1090
01:41:47,133 --> 01:41:47,834
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had the room.

1091
01:41:48,856 --> 01:41:49,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough, fair enough.

1092
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:52,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's move on.

1093
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:52,983
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more headlines, right?

1094
01:41:54,645 --> 01:42:01,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then along with that, of course, we're going to be getting some more announcements out of Announcement Fest.

1095
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:05,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Game Awards pretty soon here.

1096
01:42:06,112 --> 01:42:12,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically that the developers behind Black Myth Wukong are going to have some announcements to make.

1097
01:42:12,896 --> 01:42:13,956
[SPEAKER_08]: What are those announcements?

1098
01:42:14,477 --> 01:42:15,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1099
01:42:16,258 --> 01:42:17,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be exciting.

1100
01:42:18,139 --> 01:42:21,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Potential DLC and ports to the Xbox.

1101
01:42:21,341 --> 01:42:22,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we'll find out.

1102
01:42:22,962 --> 01:42:23,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1103
01:42:26,638 --> 01:42:27,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura.

1104
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:32,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of my least favorite fighting game series is going to be coming out for PC.

1105
01:42:33,321 --> 01:42:35,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people love it, so it's absolutely worth mentioning.

1106
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:41,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtua Fighter 5 Revo, R-E-V-O is going to be coming out for Steam.

1107
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:45,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based off of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown that came out on PS4.

1108
01:42:45,927 --> 01:42:53,191
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a rollback netcode, 4K graphics, 60 frames per second, game balance adjustments, and

1109
01:42:53,551 --> 01:43:00,733
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will come out at the same time as a version 2.0 game balance for Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown.

1110
01:43:02,054 --> 01:43:02,374
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1111
01:43:03,354 --> 01:43:08,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other player versus player games, Overwatch has a brand new hero that's been announced.

1112
01:43:08,455 --> 01:43:10,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new tank character named Hazard.

1113
01:43:11,236 --> 01:43:16,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Hazard is a Scottish fellow who's very large and he kind of looks punk rock.

1114
01:43:16,318 --> 01:43:20,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently originally conceived as a cyberpunk villain named Spiker.

1115
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:23,160
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1116
01:43:46,755 --> 01:43:50,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I was surprised when they said there was like 40-some heroes, and I'm like, holy cow.

1117
01:43:50,438 --> 01:43:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's quite a few.

1118
01:43:52,119 --> 01:43:56,243
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check them out, the trial is running right now, except it actually ends tomorrow.

1119
01:43:56,383 --> 01:44:06,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you listening on the podcast may have missed the trial, but he will be added to the roster permanently in Overwatch 2 Season 14.

1120
01:44:07,152 --> 01:44:11,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, each one of those seasons had a new character, Loki, and that starts on December 10th.

1121
01:44:14,056 --> 01:44:14,356
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1122
01:44:14,856 --> 01:44:26,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about some things coming a little sooner than that Overwatch season in world release dates, which again, with the holiday in the US, I don't think we have a lot, but let's travel the world.

1123
01:44:26,762 --> 01:44:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Loki, what's coming out in the US this week.

1124
01:44:29,572 --> 01:44:30,333
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a few things.

1131
01:45:06,274 --> 01:45:10,455
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like the official game part of that probably is unnecessary.

1132
01:45:11,535 --> 01:45:28,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Raven's Watch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Riki 8-bit game collection on Nintendo Switch Riviera, the Promised Land remaster on Nintendo Switch

1135
01:45:48,019 --> 01:45:50,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Thanksgiving, not a factor there.

1136
01:45:50,941 --> 01:45:52,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have pretty normal release week here.

1137

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God.

1180
01:49:29,744 --> 01:49:37,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so they've got, you know, basically a checkbox that says, Please disclose that this project contains content produced by gender of AI tools.

1181
01:49:38,088 --> 01:49:39,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you check yes or no.

1182
01:49:39,768 --> 01:49:42,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what kind of gender of AI is used?

1183
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:45,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Graphics, sound, text, dialogue, code, etc.

1184
01:49:45,911 --> 01:49:52,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And then along with that says they're going to allow... Also, there's going to be a...

1185
01:49:54,381 --> 01:50:02,464
[SPEAKER_08]: No AI tag applied to those who specifically mark their content as being human-made.

1186
01:50:02,744 --> 01:50:05,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll be able to filter by that.

1187
01:50:06,325 --> 01:50:13,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also said that the company is... They're trying to...

1188
01:50:15,362 --> 01:50:19,865
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially trying to block, I think, some of the scraping of that data as well.

1189
01:50:20,006 --> 01:50:30,333
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, they're also, oh, I'm sorry, they're de-indexing those creators who do not mark or comply with that as well.

1190
01:50:30,413 --> 01:50:32,435
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're going to be taking them off of their search.

1191
01:50:32,455 --> 01:50:35,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you certified Pixel Poops 2 as AI-free?

1192
01:50:37,939 --> 01:50:38,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.

1193
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:39,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to go do that.

1194
01:50:41,502 --> 01:50:42,983
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no AI poop in this game.

1195
01:50:44,181 --> 01:50:45,242
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1196
01:51:06,258 --> 01:51:12,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently we are going to be seeing an actual Minecraft theme park coming out.

1197
01:51:12,684 --> 01:51:13,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, two of them.

1198
01:51:13,885 --> 01:51:14,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of them.

1199
01:51:14,385 --> 01:51:16,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to be one in the US and one in the UK.

1200
01:51:17,328 --> 01:51:30,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometime between 2026 and 2027, Merlin Entertainment will be the ones creating these Minecraft parks that will boast interactive attractions such as, you know, and things like rides and

1201
01:51:30,499 --> 01:51:43,705
[SPEAKER_03]: gift shops, of course there's going to be gift shops, restaurants, I don't know what you would eat at the Minecraft Cafe, but cool, and then apparently plans to possibly extend this even further than just these two locations across the globe at some point.

1202
01:51:44,085 --> 01:51:54,690
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also talking about digital perks, but apparently the, you know, we don't have a lot of details, but it would be touch points that allow guests to unlock exclusive in-game content

1203
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:56,731
[SPEAKER_03]: to continue their gaming journey.

1204
01:51:57,151 --> 01:51:59,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe if Minecraft World, what was it called?

1205
01:51:59,932 --> 01:52:00,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Minecraft Realms?

1206
01:52:01,053 --> 01:52:04,114
[SPEAKER_03]: That AR game that they came and went.

1207
01:52:04,374 --> 01:52:06,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, the Minecraft Villager Rescue thing.

1208
01:52:06,875 --> 01:52:08,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's basically capes.

1209
01:52:08,776 --> 01:52:10,477
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll unlock capes or something.

1210
01:52:11,117 --> 01:52:11,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Or it'll be...

1211
01:52:13,513 --> 01:52:36,305
[SPEAKER_03]: DLC for bedrock like you know add on like costume things that they do they do that a lot like cereal and crackers and whatever else they throw minecraft stuff in now if you haven't heard of Merlin they actually this is not coming out of nowhere they are known theme park builders you may have heard of a place called Legoland which is very ironic I am also a known theme park builder

1212
01:52:39,366 --> 01:53:02,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Merlin Entertainment is behind Legoland they also have throughout Europe they have the Gardaland Resort in Italy, Chessington World of Adventures in the UK, Hyde Park in Germany so they're actually the second biggest theme park builder behind Disney and I would have thought that was Universal but I guess not so Merlin is actually the second biggest there so Loki?

1213
01:53:03,662 --> 01:53:04,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thoughts?

1214
01:53:05,768 --> 01:53:09,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's so early, because these are not coming out for another couple years, but...

1215
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:38,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to see what they do I think it's kind of funny that these are the people that make Legoland But for that reason, I don't think this is in Southern California They're not going to put this next to Legoland It's going to be in Dallas or something like that It'll be like something ridiculous I would love to see it in Silicon Valley But the land there is too fucking expensive In fact, that's why Great America is going to be going away We're only going to have one theme park in Northern California If you can believe it, for all the people who live here

1216
01:53:39,045 --> 01:53:40,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

1217
01:53:40,705 --> 01:53:42,126
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of open land.

1218
01:53:43,206 --> 01:53:43,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Florida.

1219
01:53:44,086 --> 01:53:45,086
[SPEAKER_03]: You should put it in Florida.

1220
01:53:45,866 --> 01:53:46,806
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll put it in Florida.

1221
01:53:46,866 --> 01:53:49,867
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, you know, we can.

1222
01:53:50,627 --> 01:53:54,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Have they done anything with the real world yards yet in Sacramento?

1223
01:53:54,788 --> 01:54:00,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposedly a soccer stadium is going to be the thing they're going to make there.

1224
01:54:00,249 --> 01:54:02,449
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a bunch of like hills and stuff out here.

1225
01:54:02,529 --> 01:54:05,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, you know, I'm sure they can throw something out there.

1226
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just don't know.

1227
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:06,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1228
01:54:07,915 --> 01:54:21,064
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL in chat says Great America is going away yeah that came out that news came out about a year ago but it's really weird because it's like they've sold the land that it sits it's going to become condos basically but

1229
01:54:22,054 --> 01:54:51,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess for what they still will operate Great America through like 2026 I think but it's so weird that it's like you have a lame duck theme park at this point which is wild to me I guess it's time to go before it's gone I don't think they've added anything new to it I have to look I have never ridden a ride there except the Marvel 4D thing and played a lot of Planet Harriers

1230
01:54:52,093 --> 01:54:53,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fascinating.

1231
01:54:53,594 --> 01:54:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in my no rollercoaster era.

1232
01:54:55,375 --> 01:54:58,676
[SPEAKER_03]: They still have the Mass Effect ride.

1233
01:54:59,877 --> 01:55:00,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go on that.

1234
01:55:00,897 --> 01:55:03,999
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not replacing things because they know the park is gone.

1235
01:55:04,019 --> 01:55:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Mass Effect ride is still there.

1236
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to do that before it's gone then.

1237
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you really should.

1238
01:55:08,381 --> 01:55:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, actually, here's the deal.

1239
01:55:09,842 --> 01:55:16,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Santa Clara sold the land to Cedar Fair, who sold it to Prologis.

1240
01:55:17,365 --> 01:55:20,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Six Flags will eventually close the park by 2033.

1241
01:55:22,527 --> 01:55:30,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So the land rental agreement is a six-year lease through 2028 that will give ProLogis the option of extending it another five years.

1242
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:36,814
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so weird to me, but okay.

1243
01:55:36,974 --> 01:55:38,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm trying to see like what

1244
01:55:39,511 --> 01:55:41,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things they have added.

1245
01:55:41,472 --> 01:55:44,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a way to see like what year they've added things?

1246
01:55:44,613 --> 01:55:47,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the Wiki article to try to see.

1247
01:55:48,355 --> 01:55:49,616
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they close recently?

1248
01:55:50,626 --> 01:55:51,948
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't closed a ride since 2017.

1249
01:55:52,588 --> 01:55:53,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1250
01:55:53,669 --> 01:55:56,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know they closed Logger's Run and The Endeavor?

1251
01:55:57,013 --> 01:55:59,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, one of those rides I said I would never fucking ride.

1252
01:55:59,396 --> 01:55:59,936
[SPEAKER_03]: The Endeavor.

1253
01:56:00,237 --> 01:56:02,659
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ship that would spin a complete 360.

1254
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:03,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gone.

1255
01:56:04,181 --> 01:56:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the last ride.

1256
01:56:05,002 --> 01:56:05,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1257
01:56:05,543 --> 01:56:06,784
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the last ride they closed.

1258
01:56:06,844 --> 01:56:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that.

1259
01:56:07,585 --> 01:56:10,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had zero interest in one of those since my sister threw up on one.

1260
01:56:10,769 --> 01:56:10,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugh.

1261
01:56:11,906 --> 01:56:12,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross, gross, gross.

1262
01:56:12,646 --> 01:56:14,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Mass Effect New Earth is still there.

1263
01:56:15,247 --> 01:56:15,987
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going.

1264
01:56:17,067 --> 01:56:20,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go back for fun, but yeah.

1265
01:56:21,328 --> 01:56:23,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to figure out what the most recent ride is that they opened.

1266
01:56:23,748 --> 01:56:29,529
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2022, the park introduced Liberty Twirler, a new scrambler ride.

1267
01:56:30,009 --> 01:56:32,970
[SPEAKER_03]: A new show, The Corner Notes, was also introduced.

1268
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:35,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So a scrambler ride.

1269
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:37,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like what you see at the state fair, the scrambler?

1270
01:56:37,871 --> 01:56:38,691
[SPEAKER_03]: That must be what that is.

1271
01:56:39,919 --> 01:56:41,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's one of the ones that just spins around.

1272
01:56:42,761 --> 01:56:43,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go on that.

1273
01:56:44,182 --> 01:56:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the Survivor ride, but it's no longer the Survivor ride.

1274
01:56:47,244 --> 01:56:49,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tiki Twirl, because all the Paramount stuff's gone.

1275
01:56:49,145 --> 01:56:50,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tiki Twirl.

1276
01:56:50,426 --> 01:56:59,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Top Gun ride is Flight Deck, and everything that used to be something is just... I won't go on anything made out of wood.

1277
01:56:59,984 --> 01:57:09,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the code, but yeah, because my drop tower is based off of the Great America one, and same with part of the entrance to the park is sort of based off of that as well.

1278
01:57:10,322 --> 01:57:13,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I did a lot of research when I came to look at that stuff.

1279
01:57:13,953 --> 01:57:14,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Elis went to see Margaret Cho

1280
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I was there.

1281
01:57:35,512 --> 01:57:38,355
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pride night in like our 20s.

1282
01:57:38,876 --> 01:57:41,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ, that was a long time ago.

1283
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:42,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jessica was there?

1284
01:57:43,282 --> 01:57:44,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this was, that means-

1285
01:57:49,429 --> 01:58:16,683
[SPEAKER_03]: this was before OLR because okay yeah then that was okay because that she did her CD I sang like a prayer in the karaoke booth and Travis Donovan would play that CD every fucking year for the rest of my life he's probably playing it now somewhere it's a song constant repeat making fun of it it's it's his uh his uh gray noise machine it's what he falls asleep to every night yeah

1286
01:58:19,775 --> 01:58:20,455
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, we have to go.

1287
01:58:21,156 --> 01:58:22,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be fun to go.

1288
01:58:23,316 --> 01:58:25,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I went was for that Mass Effect ride.

1289
01:58:25,657 --> 01:58:28,859
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a video of Shane and I. I think it's on the VOG Network.

1290
01:58:28,919 --> 01:58:30,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shane never lets himself be on video.

1291
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:36,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But I said, if we do this, you are going to film a video with me on this Mass Effect ride.

1292
01:58:37,622 --> 01:58:39,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was the last time I was there.

1293
01:58:39,563 --> 01:58:41,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the VOG Network YouTube somewhere.

1294
01:58:41,764 --> 01:58:42,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Us reviewing the ride.

1295
01:58:43,505 --> 01:58:43,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1296
01:58:45,718 --> 01:58:48,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says Travis has played that CD on his show.

1297
01:58:49,042 --> 01:58:50,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm well aware.

1298
01:58:51,085 --> 01:58:54,509
[SPEAKER_03]: You make it sound like he played it one time and that would be a lie.

1299
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:58,895
[SPEAKER_03]: He has played it multiple times on his show.

1300
01:59:01,212 --> 01:59:03,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this news maybe, since we're talking about theme parks.

1301
01:59:03,875 --> 01:59:06,537
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're in the listener roundtable now because we've clearly gotten off track.

1302
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:09,240
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no emails, by the way.

1303
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:11,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, participate at orangeauntradio.com.

1304
01:59:11,702 --> 01:59:12,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Try again next week.

1305
01:59:12,323 --> 01:59:14,565
[SPEAKER_03]: S2100Matt says, they're getting rid of Muppets 3D.

1306
01:59:19,289 --> 01:59:22,072
[SPEAKER_03]: and Muppet Land at Disney Hollywood Studios.

1307
01:59:22,492 --> 01:59:23,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're putting in Monsters, Inc.

1308
01:59:23,813 --> 01:59:24,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Land instead.

1309
01:59:24,754 --> 01:59:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: That does make me very sad because I liked Muppet Vision.

1310
01:59:27,877 --> 01:59:28,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cheesy as fuck.

1311
01:59:29,298 --> 01:59:31,000
[SPEAKER_03]: They got rid of it at California Great Adventure, too.

1312
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,221
[SPEAKER_03]: They got rid of it a long time ago.

1313
01:59:33,482 --> 01:59:34,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what.

1314
01:59:34,043 --> 01:59:34,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1315
01:59:35,003 --> 01:59:37,906
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a Disney World thing, not a Disney.

1316
01:59:37,966 --> 01:59:38,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1317
01:59:38,507 --> 01:59:38,827
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

1318
01:59:38,907 --> 01:59:43,591
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was still at Disney World after it was gone from California Venture.

1319
01:59:44,432 --> 01:59:54,919
[SPEAKER_03]: it's now leaving Disney World as well so it won't be anywhere bring back Captain EO what did they even do in the Captain EO theater now?

1320
01:59:56,260 --> 02:00:09,689
[SPEAKER_03]: they brought back Honey I Shrunk the Audience for a little bit for like a month which is not good, I'm sorry well yeah, but for me it was just being a little bit giggly seeing Eric Idle and Rick Moranis yeah, yeah um

1321
02:00:11,034 --> 02:00:15,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the one in California Adventure would do movie previews.

1322
02:00:15,738 --> 02:00:20,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a pretty badass Tron preview thing, but that was when Electronica was there.

1323
02:00:20,542 --> 02:00:22,704
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to give us the Tron fucking ride.

1324
02:00:23,725 --> 02:00:24,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the fuck would they build it?

1325
02:00:24,846 --> 02:00:25,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it.

1326
02:00:25,306 --> 02:00:26,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would they build it?

1327
02:00:26,427 --> 02:00:27,268
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no place to put it.

1328
02:00:29,208 --> 02:00:45,159
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the problem with California there's no like every time they talk about expanding Disneyland they are going to have to bulldoze a hotel to do it basically so there is talk that they just take out the little theater and the Monsters Inc right there and make it a

1329
02:00:46,420 --> 02:01:03,642
[SPEAKER_03]: uh under partly underground and partly above ground and there is talk that Disney's gonna expand um I think they're gonna tear down Mickey and Friends and build the parking structure further away and they want to build another space in Mickey and Friends I don't know it's something wild I mean

1330
02:01:04,563 --> 02:01:09,186
[SPEAKER_01]: They tore down the whole parking lot to give us California Adventure and Downtown Disney.

1331
02:01:09,206 --> 02:01:10,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a playbook that works.

1332
02:01:10,027 --> 02:01:20,654
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, if you've only been to Disney World and never Disneyland, you need to understand Disneyland is in the middle of what us and NorCal would just simply call LA.

1333
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:22,996
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Anaheim.

1334
02:01:23,136 --> 02:01:29,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It is surrounded by some kind of businesses, like older businesses.

1335
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Development.

1336
02:01:30,821 --> 02:01:31,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And a neighborhood.

1337
02:01:32,662 --> 02:01:33,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And neighborhoods.

1338
02:01:34,321 --> 02:01:34,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1339
02:01:35,382 --> 02:01:39,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why there's those big tubes on Incredicoaster.

1340
02:01:40,224 --> 02:01:46,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's no place for them to put new stuff without tearing down something old.

1341
02:01:47,167 --> 02:01:49,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just start becoming like a triple-decker amusement park.

1342
02:01:50,188 --> 02:01:51,769
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the park of the future.

1343
02:01:51,789 --> 02:01:52,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1344
02:01:53,534 --> 02:01:56,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you that they replaced the whole innovations place with a restaurant.

1345
02:01:57,436 --> 02:01:58,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did they finally replace it?

1346
02:01:58,557 --> 02:01:59,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.

1347
02:02:00,058 --> 02:02:00,678
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple years ago.

1348
02:02:00,978 --> 02:02:05,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say though, this is important too for Florida, the people that have only ever done Disney World.

1349
02:02:05,621 --> 02:02:13,445
[SPEAKER_03]: The advantage of Disneyland is that because there's no more space and everything is right there, everything is right there.

1350
02:02:13,685 --> 02:02:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get a park hopper, you literally walk from one park to the other like you're crossing the street.

1351
02:02:19,869 --> 02:02:20,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.

1352
02:02:20,609 --> 02:02:21,390
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good in souls.

1353
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:26,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Florida's not... Florida, you gotta move around by shuttle or something.

1354
02:02:27,234 --> 02:02:28,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus, it's Florida.

1355
02:02:28,695 --> 02:02:29,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's Florida.

1356
02:02:30,877 --> 02:02:32,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway.

1357
02:02:32,698 --> 02:02:36,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Full disclaimer, I've never been to Disney World in Florida.

1358
02:02:36,761 --> 02:02:38,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only been to Disney Springs.

1359
02:02:38,602 --> 02:02:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was just last year because our cruise was out of Orlando.

1360
02:02:41,725 --> 02:02:44,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I would get to go this year.

1361
02:02:44,847 --> 02:02:46,168
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1362
02:03:09,147 --> 02:03:36,615
[SPEAKER_03]: now here's the I didn't read the second half of what SGO and Hunter Matt said about the Muppets thing because I actually think this part is pretty cool so there is a ride that we don't have it in California I've never been on it it's called Rockin' Roller Coaster featuring Aerosmith is the ride I think it's an indoor roller coaster I think they got rid of the Aerosmith one a while ago though yeah it is no so Aerosmith I thought the Aerosmith one didn't it replace like the old Hollywood dark ride or am I wrong

1363
02:03:38,051 --> 02:03:39,452
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that was the ride.

1364
02:03:39,472 --> 02:03:39,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1365
02:03:39,752 --> 02:03:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they built it as Aerosmith.

1366
02:03:40,853 --> 02:03:41,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

1367
02:03:41,933 --> 02:03:42,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1368
02:03:42,574 --> 02:03:43,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the history of Disney.

1369
02:03:43,554 --> 02:03:48,017
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be thinking of two different ones, but I know that the Hollywood ride was crap.

1370
02:03:48,217 --> 02:03:48,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1371
02:03:49,076 --> 02:03:53,279
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the, the part of the other reason why Aerosmith is going away.

1372
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the band is kind of retired, but the Muppets are going to be the new, so it's going to be an electric, what do they call the band?

1373
02:03:59,223 --> 02:04:00,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The electric, electric mayhem.

1374
02:04:00,784 --> 02:04:04,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be an, it's going to be rock and roller coaster with electric mayhem now.

1375
02:04:04,426 --> 02:04:04,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1376
02:04:04,966 --> 02:04:06,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is actually kind of badass.

1377
02:04:06,728 --> 02:04:09,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I just, I want to ride with Janice.

1378
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:13,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Janice is the most underrated Muppet on the entire fucking series.

1379
02:04:13,852 --> 02:04:17,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like an electric mayhem ride is going to like feature Janice.

1380
02:04:18,903 --> 02:04:37,162
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah so it was it was uh rockin roller coaster uh with Aerosmith and then they re in 2019 they changed it to Avengers Assemble Flight Force and now it's a new thing now okay Muppet Vision 3D yeah

1381
02:04:40,094 --> 02:05:02,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says the Hollywood Dark Ride was replaced recently it's not the same as Rockin' Roller Coaster okay when I think when I hear Hollywood Dark Ride I hear of what I think most people agree is the absolute worst ride Disney has ever done in their mere existence and that was Superstar Limo at California's Great Adventure that was what I was thinking of but I thought that they had a version of

1382
02:05:03,996 --> 02:05:06,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, no, they didn't do that at California Adventure, did they?

1383
02:05:06,778 --> 02:05:07,479
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, Superstar Limo.

1384
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:08,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they did that.

1385
02:05:08,519 --> 02:05:12,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Superstar Limo was there from opening day for like six months, and then it was gone.

1386
02:05:12,342 --> 02:05:13,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Monsters, the Monsters, Inc.

1387
02:05:13,523 --> 02:05:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: ride is what used to be Superstar Limo.

1388
02:05:15,724 --> 02:05:15,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1389
02:05:15,905 --> 02:05:17,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so.

1390
02:05:17,386 --> 02:05:19,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think, I haven't been on that or the Monsters, Inc.

1391
02:05:19,807 --> 02:05:20,007
[SPEAKER_08]: ride yet.

1392
02:05:20,088 --> 02:05:20,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty awful.

1393
02:05:20,848 --> 02:05:22,429
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why in the Monsters, Inc.

1394
02:05:22,489 --> 02:05:24,909
[SPEAKER_03]: ride, there's the little TVs on the thing.

1395
02:05:25,549 --> 02:05:27,770
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to reverse engineer a lot of Monsters, Inc.

1396
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:31,951
[SPEAKER_03]: into what that crap... Yeah, and you can find a ride of Superstar Limo on YouTube.

1397
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:32,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad.

1398
02:05:33,092 --> 02:05:35,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really bad.

1399
02:05:35,172 --> 02:05:38,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Defunctland is a really good resource for a lot of that.

1400
02:05:38,453 --> 02:05:39,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love watching them.

1401
02:05:40,905 --> 02:05:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: S200 Matt says that old Hollywood ride became the Mickey and Minnie Runaway Railroad.

1402
02:05:46,553 --> 02:05:48,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they do have that ride at Disneyland.

1403
02:05:48,436 --> 02:05:49,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good.

1404
02:05:49,197 --> 02:05:49,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that ride.

1405
02:05:49,898 --> 02:05:50,639
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really good.

1406
02:05:52,028 --> 02:05:57,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was like Rise of the Resistance for kids was what I got out of that ride.

1407
02:05:57,653 --> 02:05:58,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've been on that.

1408
02:05:59,274 --> 02:05:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's good.

1409
02:06:00,155 --> 02:06:00,876
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mickey Minnie.

1410
02:06:01,336 --> 02:06:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's like Disney's newest ride in SoCal.

1411
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right near... I just stood in line for Rise of the Resistance several times in a row.

1412
02:06:10,284 --> 02:06:12,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Toontown.

1413
02:06:12,426 --> 02:06:15,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they took out some of the stables that used to be behind Toontown.

1414
02:06:16,289 --> 02:06:44,191
[SPEAKER_03]: and they built it it's right next to Roger Rabbit but like I think they okay they built it behind where it used to be backstage I didn't go to Toontown at all oh that's why that's a huge ride yeah but yeah I recommend it they I don't want to spoil it if you've never been on it but like the way the ride starts in the queue was really impressive I was like and I'm sure it's the same trick in Florida but I was like okay that was really well done like the way they do that so that's that's all I'll say about it

1415
02:06:45,616 --> 02:06:48,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a good queue is the kind that makes people forget they're in queue.

1416
02:06:48,537 --> 02:06:50,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly what that ride did.

1417
02:06:53,098 --> 02:06:53,438
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1418
02:06:53,598 --> 02:06:58,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, well, we could talk theme park rides all night probably, but we don't have any emails, sadly.

1419
02:06:58,999 --> 02:07:01,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me check in with Loki, though, to see if there's any last minute stories.

1420
02:07:04,101 --> 02:07:04,321
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1421
02:07:04,841 --> 02:07:05,201
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

1422
02:07:05,421 --> 02:07:07,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is a holiday week after all.

1423
02:07:08,482 --> 02:07:13,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that note, I hope those of you that are celebrating Thanksgiving this week have a good one.

1424
02:07:14,386 --> 02:07:42,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you have safe journeys wherever you might be going and like for example I'm just doing Thanksgiving with my dad it's just going to be the three of us and that's fine we're doing cousin giving but one of my best gal pals and former co-host of the show called Shaking and Crying Here Miss Victoria or Aria Snark is going to be performing in Rocky Horror Picture Show Thanksgiving weekend so I'm going to go see it as if I haven't seen that movie enough times in my life but I'll see it one more time for Victoria

1425
02:07:42,944 --> 02:07:46,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rob, my ballet studio is doing Time Warp.

1426
02:07:46,785 --> 02:07:47,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's fun.

1427
02:07:48,386 --> 02:07:52,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I opted not to because I'm already doing a bunch of stuff.

1428
02:07:52,347 --> 02:07:55,028
[SPEAKER_01]: That and the... I don't get to be Magenta.

1429
02:07:56,389 --> 02:07:57,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have been mad too.

1430
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:59,870
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually no one going to be in costume except for like two people.

1431
02:08:02,511 --> 02:08:02,831
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1432
02:08:03,516 --> 02:08:11,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever you're doing for Thanksgiving, and even if you made a choice not to go be with family this year because you just can't handle it, that's fine.

1433
02:08:11,784 --> 02:08:14,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanksgiving is whatever it looks like to you, mental health-wise.

1434
02:08:14,866 --> 02:08:18,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you have a mental wellness day.

1435
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:27,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you have a mentally relaxing and uplifting day, however you choose to spend it, and a little break from your day job, that type of thing.

1436
02:08:28,959 --> 02:08:31,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Thoughts and prayers to all of you Black Friday workers.

1437
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:36,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to offer in that situation except- I have something else to offer.

1438
02:08:36,381 --> 02:08:37,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I will commit- If I may.

1439
02:08:37,442 --> 02:08:39,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I will commit to not being an asshole on Black Friday.

1440
02:08:40,303 --> 02:08:41,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, DarkSakura.

1441
02:08:41,823 --> 02:08:43,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an alternative to Black Friday.

1442
02:08:44,264 --> 02:08:45,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a sub-a-thon.

1443
02:08:45,384 --> 02:08:45,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you are.

1444
02:08:45,984 --> 02:08:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you are.

1445
02:08:47,085 --> 02:08:52,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than stay in line and buy the TV you don't need, you could just hang out with me.

1446
02:08:52,806 --> 02:08:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1447
02:08:53,407 --> 02:08:54,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Friendsgiving, virtually.

1448
02:08:55,627 --> 02:08:56,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to put this down here-

1449
02:08:58,891 --> 02:09:08,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put this out here right now is that I have a special prize in the form of handwritten, sarcastic, and borderline rude holiday cards.

1450
02:09:09,413 --> 02:09:09,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

1451
02:09:10,074 --> 02:09:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: What time are you starting?

1452
02:09:11,994 --> 02:09:12,254
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 a.m.

1453
02:09:12,614 --> 02:09:12,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

1454
02:09:13,014 --> 02:09:13,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come.

1455
02:09:13,394 --> 02:09:14,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I hate myself.

1456
02:09:14,415 --> 02:09:15,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come at the beginning.

1457
02:09:15,655 --> 02:09:15,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Kidding.

1458
02:09:16,935 --> 02:09:17,155
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1459
02:09:17,175 --> 02:09:18,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then that means you have to play.

1460
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:18,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm leaving here at 1.

1461
02:09:19,336 --> 02:09:22,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I promised you a Himbo Chris, Dead by Daylight, and I plan to deliver.

1462
02:09:22,497 --> 02:09:23,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a Himbo Chris.

1463
02:09:23,677 --> 02:09:24,017
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1464
02:09:24,177 --> 02:09:24,397
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1465
02:09:26,092 --> 02:09:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well with that, we're going to wrap up tonight's show.

1471
02:09:39,564 --> 02:09:42,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1472
02:09:42,846 --> 02:09:44,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell a friend or two about the show.

1473
02:09:45,128 --> 02:09:49,712
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show.

1474
02:09:50,113 --> 02:09:52,575
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that goes an awful long way and we really appreciate it.

1475
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:56,617
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1476
02:09:57,037 --> 02:10:00,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of streaming, I'm imagining DarkSakura's probably got some DVD in her tonight.

1477
02:10:01,098 --> 02:10:04,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be me and Smokey doing a 2v8 killer.

1478
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that'll be fun.

1479
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,900
[SPEAKER_03]: You going to keep working on your spirit?

1480
02:10:08,461 --> 02:10:10,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've actually kind of enjoyed playing spirit.

1481
02:10:10,882 --> 02:10:14,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really all that great, but I've gotten some spicy hits, and that made me happy.

1482
02:10:14,703 --> 02:10:15,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good.

1483
02:10:15,883 --> 02:10:17,644
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1484
02:10:21,705 --> 02:10:22,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1485
02:10:22,326 --> 02:10:22,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Just...

1486
02:10:23,686 --> 02:10:24,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shitty.

1487
02:10:25,147 --> 02:10:25,507
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1488
02:10:26,067 --> 02:10:26,608
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good plan.

1489
02:10:26,628 --> 02:10:27,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Be good.

1490
02:10:27,548 --> 02:10:28,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be good.

1491
02:10:29,869 --> 02:10:30,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1492
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:32,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good stream, DarkSakura.

1493
02:10:32,791 --> 02:10:33,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1494
02:10:34,332 --> 02:10:35,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll go over to you.

1495
02:10:35,273 --> 02:10:36,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought tonight.

1496
02:10:37,154 --> 02:10:38,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a lot of work to do this week.

1497
02:10:39,195 --> 02:10:39,795
[SPEAKER_03]: You sure do.

1498
02:10:39,875 --> 02:10:40,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And cook.

1499
02:10:41,736 --> 02:10:48,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta make that happen for what you're trying to do with your channel and all that good stuff, right?

1500
02:10:49,701 --> 02:10:49,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1501
02:10:51,363 --> 02:10:52,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

1502
02:10:52,703 --> 02:10:58,666
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is... I don't know.

1503
02:10:58,686 --> 02:11:00,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I have a lot.

1504
02:11:00,606 --> 02:11:04,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to host another show last night and that's always a very lovely feeling.

1505
02:11:04,848 --> 02:11:06,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I always love being able to do that.

1506
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:10,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to being able to do more of that in the future.

1507
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:13,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what I'm going to say about that.

1508
02:11:14,963 --> 02:11:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1509
02:11:16,004 --> 02:11:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to wrap it up, except I just realized as I'm starting to wrap it up here, I was supposed to put in a new outro tonight that I forgot to do.

1510
02:11:22,987 --> 02:11:24,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to do it right now.

1511
02:11:24,788 --> 02:11:30,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, you could help me buy a little time here with a second final thought, if you might have anything.

1512
02:11:32,027 --> 02:11:51,257
[SPEAKER_08]: uh yeah my second final thought I guess would be um yeah go watch my episode that I put out it's fun it's got plushies that I worked hard on and there's a lot of redstone in there so we're gonna probably thinking about um doing like a series a small series on like

1513
02:11:51,897 --> 02:11:55,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Mini game design and stuff in Minecraft.

1514
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:58,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, kind of what it takes to do that.

1515
02:11:58,242 --> 02:12:00,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's kind of what I'm doing next season anyways.

1516
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a mini game.

1517
02:12:01,204 --> 02:12:02,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be like a massive game.

1518
02:12:03,086 --> 02:12:05,108
[SPEAKER_08]: But same concept applies.

1519
02:12:05,148 --> 02:12:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have to break down what you want to do and how to do it and all the components and everything.

1520
02:12:10,472 --> 02:12:10,692
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1521
02:12:10,712 --> 02:12:11,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Like game design, actually.

1522
02:12:12,033 --> 02:12:12,754
[SPEAKER_08]: It is game design.

1523
02:12:12,934 --> 02:12:13,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1524
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1525
02:12:16,821 --> 02:12:18,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so much for listening.

1526
02:12:18,762 --> 02:12:27,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a wonderful week and we will see you in seven days to talk about whatever you might have bought for holiday sales and Cyber Monday and all that bullshit.

1527
02:12:27,245 --> 02:12:28,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one everybody.

1528
02:12:28,206 --> 02:12:28,466
