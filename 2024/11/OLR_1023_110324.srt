1
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:17,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading through the news, I couldn't help but grit my teeth at a statement by Satya Nadella stating that As we look ahead, our intellectual properties across our studios have never been stronger.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,631
[SPEAKER_01]: The context thanking Call of Duty chiefly.

3
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:25,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Microsoft's portfolio has never been stronger as they keep the cod mines churning while shuttering studios that provide its sorely needed variety.

4
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Businessmen excel at moving money around.

5
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:29,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the car and back in the saddle.

6
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:35,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this glib victory lap and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:37,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:46,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:48,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:57,029
[SPEAKER_09]: We're live once again with episode number 1023 of our show for today, November the 3rd of 2024.

12
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:06,431
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined here with you maybe an hour earlier, depending on where you're at, with the one and only DarkSakura, or J.B.

13
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:06,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Summers.

14
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:09,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Arizona, but honestly it should stay this way.

15
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:30,895
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I totally feel the opposite.

16
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Hawaii does either.

17
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:32,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hi, Loki.

18
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:34,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're right.

19
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:35,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Hawaii does.

20
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,961
[SPEAKER_09]: They're always in a different time zone though because of where they're at.

21
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And parts of Indiana?

22
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:42,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there really parts of Indiana that don't change?

23
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:44,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that.

24
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:45,606
[SPEAKER_04]: We should just stay like this.

25
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice for my vampire self.

26
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:52,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, see, but for me, and I have moods that are affected by seasons.

27
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked about this before.

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not like the less light at all.

29
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:00,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to be able to go walk while it's still light out and get vitamin D that way.

30
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:03,354
[SPEAKER_09]: But usually in this time of year, I just go at lunch.

31
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:05,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to hope it doesn't rain.

32
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:07,377
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

33
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get you a light lamp.

34
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:09,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It has done wonders for me.

35
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:10,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Has it?

36
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:10,738
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

37
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one for a while.

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what happened to it, though.

39
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it got left behind.

40
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, my alarm clock has a wake-up light.

41
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:18,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah?

42
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:22,859
[SPEAKER_04]: and that actually has helped me quite a bit.

43
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,280
[SPEAKER_09]: That's nice.

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a cheapy alarm clock I've had forever, but I use my phone.

45
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:29,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like a lot of people just use their phones in this day and age.

46
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:30,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I use my phone.

47
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:31,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I use both.

48
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And now my phone tracks my sleep because I have Pokemon sleep.

49
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:36,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel like waking up to the sound of birds.

50
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't wake up to the sound of birds.

51
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:44,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that normal like... Well, no, no, no.

52
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone with an iPhone knows the marimba.

53
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: My... My, uh, clock...

54
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,638
[SPEAKER_04]: has bird noises and weird shit.

55
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:55,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have it on for the light.

56
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I only use it for the light.

57
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:06,001
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone, I wake up to six different alarms, including excerpts from Super Metroid and Sonic the Hedgehog and a few other things.

58
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:18,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Over in our chat room, over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, VOG Network on Twitch and vognetwork.com, nine o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

59
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,006
[SPEAKER_09]: 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

60
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:27,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, PodCulture, who lives in Indiana, says they stopped doing that a few years back with the parts of Indiana that switched around.

61
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:30,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess it really is just Arizona and probably Hawaii.

62
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:35,759
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have anybody in Hawaii to confirm, but I think that is correct, that they don't flip the clocks either.

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So how about that?

64
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:43,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, but we don't just talk about clocks here on Orange Launch Radio.

65
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,569
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about what is going on in the gaming world.

66
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:50,471
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's just jump into it and talk about a gaming-related app.

67
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you want to start us off tonight talking about a new app that Nintendo put out this week?

68
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:00,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Nintendo put out an app called Nintendo Music.

69
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:03,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to listen to Nintendo Music.

70
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:09,448
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, much like those other apps that have other music in them, but except this is just Nintendo.

71
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:10,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.

72
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Other features they have in there as well.

73
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:17,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Some songs, obviously a lot of the 8-bit stuff that was in your games.

74
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:20,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very short.

75
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a one minute loop or whatever.

76
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:28,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be extended to 15, 30 or 60 minutes or just infinitely.

77
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just loop it forever.

78
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,152
[SPEAKER_02]: We call that replay or loop or something like that.

79
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:35,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

80
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:43,675
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an initial wave of tracks from all different games in several different platforms.

81
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, some of the more popular stuff, Animal Crossing New Horizons.

82
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,068
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the Wii with the Wii channels.

83
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Mii Shop channel all day long.

84
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about that in a minute because I have a funny story about that.

85
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:09,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Donkey Kong Country, Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Brothers, Splatoon, Star Fox, Nintendogs, Zelda, all the stuff.

86
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,308
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not everything.

87
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:11,868
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not everything.

88
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:18,491
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a limited selection and it's very obvious like the catalog of classic games.

89
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,832
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to add to it every week for a little while until...

90
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:45,426
[SPEAKER_02]: they are pulling what they do with the Nintendo Online stuff with the games and slowly drip feeding it out and of course much like the Nintendo Online stuff you have to have your Switch Online service and be paying for that in order to get access to this app on your mobile device um

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, I guess.

92
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that they're having that there.

93
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:56,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of wish that, you know, it would just be on any of the other apps that I use, you know.

94
00:05:57,628 --> 00:06:04,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of it is because they illegally put it there, but it's fine, I guess.

95
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be even cooler if it was incorporated into the Switch.

96
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

97
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,480
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is funny because I know nobody will remember this and I don't have the recording in front of me.

98
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know y'all get sick of the Rob Stradamus thing, but I fucking said Nintendo should do this some time ago.

99
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:32,422
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing, I will say this, the only thing I got wrong is I don't think, I don't know, and I'd have to go back and find the clip and there are people much better at searching the archive than I am.

100
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:37,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe somebody can find this because I want to say we were talking about it when Nintendo was taking down all those YouTube channels.

101
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:45,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was saying, you know, Nintendo ought to just take that part of Super Smash Brothers with the music player and have it on the Nintendo Switch with a Switch Online.

102
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was thinking, you know, people do hook up their headphones into the Switch.

103
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't think – I don't think in the moment I was thinking about cell phones.

104
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:56,024
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:12,135
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, that's separate, I think.

106
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that has anything to do with this.

107
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:17,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe they're putting this out to... I think it's yes and no.

108
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:20,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the response to that made them decide to do this.

109
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a little bit of both.

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Nintendo has been planning this for a little while, which brings me to my other point.

111
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:27,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo moves so fucking slow sometimes.

112
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:30,145
[SPEAKER_09]: This app would have been so much better if it was like five years ago.

113
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:48,881
[SPEAKER_09]: that's the biggest problem this should have rolled out with Nintendo Online or shortly after we should be talking about it now in 2024 when most people are asking the question where's Nintendo's next console and perhaps this is Nintendo's way to try to I think there's a lot of people this month

114
00:07:49,241 --> 00:08:17,341
[SPEAKER_09]: because you know they've around the time of this month is when people are re-upping their annual subs to Nintendo Switch Online so maybe this is just a play for people don't cancel it just yet y'all don't cancel this just yet because we've got all this you know music available in this player this is an added benefit of Nintendo Switch Online so you shouldn't cancel just yet I think ultimately that's a big part of it I mean while yes it is a thing I just don't see myself using this like honestly like

115
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:30,284
[SPEAKER_02]: if I want to listen to Nintendo music I will just incorporate it into my playlist in Spotify like if I have to find a YouTube video how?

116
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:31,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo music isn't on Spotify

117
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but you can play your own library that's on your device.

118
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I find a way to download it, which is super easy, and just incorporate it that way.

119
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to do that because it's too much of a hassle.

120
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,211
[SPEAKER_02]: The value add is very minimal at this point, I think.

121
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

122
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:51,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

123
00:08:54,341 --> 00:09:22,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it super easily on Apple Music because all I do is add it on my computer and it syncs to the cloud and I have my music well not with Apple Music I do it with crap, the other thing iTunes Connect I forgot what it's called it's an iTunes iTunes Match that's it, iTunes Match right, but like to the point though that it's not a big value add

124
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,437
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of music on YouTube that wasn't taken down.

125
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:32,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So I find that if I want to listen to Nintendo music, it's still on YouTube.

126
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Just maybe not some of the large channels.

127
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:35,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Or it's people that altered it a little bit.

128
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:42,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's somebody that took a bunch of 8-bit songs and made them stereo, which is, you know, some people like that's sacrilege.

129
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,510
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what it was originally.

130
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:46,752
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm like, I don't care.

131
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:47,493
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds kind of neat.

132
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,975
[SPEAKER_09]: So like there's a lot of those type of things.

133
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:50,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

134
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,539
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, the Nintendo Music app is fine.

135
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't I don't have an issue with it.

136
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:58,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, I said it's something Nintendo ought to do.

137
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,028
[SPEAKER_09]: They did it.

138
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's hard for me to sit here and be like, why did they do it?

139
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:06,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the weird thing, though, like on top of all that, like it.

140
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:12,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about having no foresight into things.

141
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:21,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You just released Alarmo, an alarm clock device, and yet this is not incorporated into that.

142
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:22,547
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like...

143
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,080
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you even doing?

144
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:33,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you have a device that's essentially a clock radio, and you're like, nah, nah, we're just not gonna do that.

145
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:33,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

146
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you that.

147
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:41,760
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice if the Alarmo connected with that so I could wake up every morning to the sounds of the escape music from the original Metroid.

148
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:42,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

149
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,523
[SPEAKER_09]: My only complaint about it is that it's limited.

150
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:49,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the repeat feature that's in there.

151
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:50,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's cute.

152
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:57,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bobby brings up a good point, and I would agree with this, is that there's not an infinite replay.

153
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only 15, 30, or 60 minutes.

154
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Replay would have fade outs and fade ins.

155
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:09,297
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, you know, if you were to do that based off like CD soundtracks, there was always a fade out and fade in because it was a loop forever.

156
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:14,860
[SPEAKER_09]: So it helps to keep things a little more, you know, but any basic audio editing would get you that.

157
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,140
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, it's the convenience, right?

158
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It's convenience of having it all there and knowing that you're doing it the legitimate way or whatever you want to say about that.

159
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:28,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know I get the warm fuzzies when I'm biting by Nintendo's corporate rules and all that stuff.

160
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:33,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's just like, oh, we'd want to anchor corporate Nintendo.

161
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, that would be awful if I could just have fun with their IP.

162
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:40,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having fun on my own.

163
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:42,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Not trying to profit off of it.

164
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having fun with it without them...

165
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Being so strict with the rules.

166
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:29,051
[SPEAKER_09]: and they have the Famicom disc soundtrack for Metroid and of course as I'm sure many of you know there is a difference because the Famicom disc system specifically the disc system which Metroid and Kid Icarus and some other games were released on because that's why we had password versions and battery packs here because those were disc system translation games and that's how they got around the fact that the discs never came out in the US but that disc system had an extra sound chip and so some of the songs actually sounded different

167
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:30,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Castlevania 3

168
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but now that leads to the other big question.

169
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So Castlevania III, Konami game, right?

170
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So probably not going to be in the Nintendo Music app.

171
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:56,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Or will it?

172
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:06,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is an interesting question and to be determined is how will or will Nintendo third-party publishers be worked into this?

173
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:11,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, Konami, I think, has played pretty well with the Switch Online.

174
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:11,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually...

175
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:13,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not.

176
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:14,509
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done some stuff.

177
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,530
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple.

178
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like there was more on Virtual Console and we might have like Castlevania.

179
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we have.

180
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:24,435
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because they did their separate collections.

181
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:27,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually don't think we have anything Konami on Switch Online at this point.

182
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,238
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because...

183
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:56,154
[SPEAKER_02]: or it there might be a couple like Legend of the Mystical Ninja I think might be in there things that were like more one-offs here uh because I know Goemon is a much bigger series in Japan but I just can't help but think of how profitable this would be if they just sold these like like they did virtual console with you know you have the games you can buy the games and you can buy the soundtracks and you have it all in one library and then maybe that library is accessible on your mobile device as well like it would

184
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:02,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like that would be more valuable than what they're offering here.

185
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I mean, I can say I'm never going to use this.

186
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:12,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I pay for this, I pay for the extended, you know, whatever they call it, Switch Online Plus or whatever the hell it's called.

187
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:13,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it doesn't matter.

188
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:17,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, you know, get some DLC for free type stuff.

189
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just never going to use this.

190
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:24,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, cool that they're doing this.

191
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

192
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:52,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Would third-party publishers maybe start lending some of their stuff?

193
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:56,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially ones with legendary soundtracks, which are many of them.

194
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:00,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom, like shit, if the whole Mega Man library could be on there, that would be awesome.

195
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:05,038
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, again, most of that is on Spotify and iTunes and all the other stuff too.

196
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:06,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm curious...

197
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero, so, you know...

198
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:58,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not zero because Spotify, YouTube Music, iTunes It depends what the third party company has done For example, The Guardian Legend I would listen to that soundtrack every day There's no official way to do it That's a big fat nada because those publishing rights are kind of up in the air I think Compile might have actually released a soundtrack

199
00:15:58,905 --> 00:15:59,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you serious?

200
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:00,409
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big deal.

201
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm going to double check.

202
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:03,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing something about this.

203
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:03,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.

204
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Guardit Gaiden soundtrack.

205
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:34,162
[SPEAKER_09]: um so uh you would have uh that but then like you know I'm almost positive Konami has released a lot of soundtracks as has Capcom to things like Spotify and iTunes etc etc and you know I don't think they make oh my gosh a ton of money but they make a bit oh Square Enix is a great example says Fifth Dream uh Square Enix says uh they have a lot on Spotify I'm grateful so um

206
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:36,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we just have one Nintendo online app?

207
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:50,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't they just add this into the existing Nintendo online app?

208
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it's a different thing.

209
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:58,878
[SPEAKER_09]: But shouldn't we have one target launch place for all things Nintendo?

210
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that would just be, I feel like that would just be the better way to design an app.

211
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,280
[SPEAKER_09]: But what do I know?

212
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a schmo with a podcast, huh?

213
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:10,842
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, let's see.

214
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I was incorrect, by the way, but I got you.

215
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:40,016
[SPEAKER_09]: well yeah no I know I know like it's easy to get the soundtrack rip it from YouTube or rip it from the game or whatever like I can do but like I'm saying there's no official way where somebody gets money because I am streaming the Guardian Legend soundtrack so that's I I would I would support that every day Guardian Legend for Nintendo music hashtag I'll keep on dreaming all right

216
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:49,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on from Nintendo Music and talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we have been playing this week or music we've been jamming out to, I guess, whatever is the case.

217
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

218
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,432
[SPEAKER_04]: New and exciting, yeah.

219
00:17:57,052 --> 00:17:58,232
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it really was.

220
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:09,436
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, of course, played Dead by Daylight now that it's working and I got a response back on my ticket and they gave me 100,000 blood points for my trouble.

221
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cute.

222
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:18,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I say cute because did they give away like 300,000 blood points?

223
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:22,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got all of that too, but this is an extra 100,000 and that was nice.

224
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:23,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I guess it's something.

225
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:24,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gesture.

226
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:25,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's extra.

227
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway...

228
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:36,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it was enough for me to get Dracula to P2, so hey.

229
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:47,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, of course, I also played Polya, and then my game came out this past week that I have been waiting for for a decade.

230
00:18:48,905 --> 00:19:14,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Age The Veil Guard came out and you want to know what it's fucking great do not listen to the review bombers they're they're being assholes because they don't I don't know I don't care what they think it's great it's beautiful I am playing it of course to on Steam through the GeForce experience and it's it's beautiful I haven't had any problems with it um it's absolutely amazing I am really really really really happy with it

231
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:18,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just showing off my PlayStation 5 copy ready to go.

232
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:22,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it yet, but I'm hoping I finally will start tomorrow.

233
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people who have been going off on it because of quote, wokeness, whatever.

234
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:38,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that comes from the fact that you can actually choose your gender identity as male, female, or non-binary.

235
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:46,687
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't quite encompass all of the selections out there, but this is far better than what we've seen before.

236
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:55,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they also have your pronoun selection as he, him, she, her, and then they.

237
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:04,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, going a little bit further than some other games have gone, you have... Sorry, I just don't...

238
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:08,074
[SPEAKER_09]: These people, they get so mad about these.

239
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:14,957
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it's a lot like the gay marriage argument, is that people are like, people should not have the right to marry somebody of the same gender.

240
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:22,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And the classic retort that I think still holds water is, if you don't like gay marriages, don't get one.

241
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:48,270
[SPEAKER_09]: that's that's all yeah that's all you have to do if you don't want to get married to somebody of the same sex don't nobody is forcing you to and it's the same thing with pronouns and gender identity in games you it's it's very easy for you to not play somebody non-binary in this game if you don't want to wow what a concept my whole thing on that is I don't think bigots deserve any attention I would rather treat them like the relics they are and leave them in the past

242
00:20:49,497 --> 00:21:13,952
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately those bigots are getting headlines by review bombing which sucks we just don't have to give them any attention they do it for attention they do it to push something and if people just keep ignoring them keep voting against the things that they're standing for that's the problem that's why I don't want to stay silent because they're voting and clearly in large numbers which is scary they're all going to die

243
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: of natural causes, DarkSakura means.

244
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here's what I mean by this.

245
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Hyperbole, Twitch terms of service.

246
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:26,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine, hyperbole.

247
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:28,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the fact of life.

248
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:31,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody dies, end of story, no matter how.

249
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:32,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And here is my thing.

250
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:44,506
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look over the course of history, and yeah, we do have moments where there are setbacks, but things tend to move towards a more progressive state.

251
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:49,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have legal segregation anymore?

252
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I said legal.

253
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I go out and get a credit card, Rob?

254
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was two years before I was born and I was an adult, I would not be able to get a credit card without Dan approving it.

255
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: What about everybody having voting rights?

256
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:14,689
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who are voting against this shit...

257
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:26,535
[SPEAKER_04]: As they die out, and the more progressive voices stay afloat, then, I mean, it's just a matter of progress.

258
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:29,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The conservative is exactly what it is.

259
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:36,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Conservative, and that usually ends up falling by the wayside as people learn new things about themselves and about society.

260
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:43,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I just say that, and I feel comfort by it, and I'm...

261
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:53,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so to me, they're like having a roach infestation, right?

262
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:59,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I just use my powers of extermination.

263
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I vote, and my vote will exterminate one other vote.

264
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how I see it.

265
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,393
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, please vote on Tuesday, everybody.

266
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Or now, if your state allows it.

267
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:12,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

268
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we know common sense is so rare it's a superpower, right?

269
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:17,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

270
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:18,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Deadpool.

271
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, back to Dragon Age.

272
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, back to Dragon Age.

273
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I found the combat to actually be pretty okay.

274
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:34,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I do miss some of the targeting from Dragon Age Inquisition.

275
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:48,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It made playing a mage a lot easier, but I really like how they've done kind of a different lock-on system.

276
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a true lock-on, in my opinion.

277
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:58,145
[SPEAKER_04]: But the battle mode and the regular running around mode are sort of integrated in that.

278
00:23:58,725 --> 00:23:59,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, I really enjoy it.

279
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:01,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Character creation is still kind of wonky.

280
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them are kind of wonky.

281
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:09,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had to go back and tweak my character at least once.

282
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:17,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm enjoying that one of my favorite characters is Romanceable, and no, it's not Varric.

283
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:27,996
[SPEAKER_04]: also, the game will start out by punching you in the gut of your heart that's all I'm going to say um

284
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:53,725
[SPEAKER_04]: also the they have in like certain textures and things for uh injured characters um if it's part of a story point I think that's pretty cool but anyway I'm I'm loving it the voice acting is great I still want to punch Solas in the face and I think that the name of it should be changed to Dragon Age for fuck's sake Solas well originally the game was called Dragon Age Solas wasn't it the dread is called Dragon Age the Dread Wolf

285
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,740
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but originally it was called... Like, in development.

286
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,021
[SPEAKER_09]: It had, like, three other... No, I want to say the first first name was Dragon Age Solus.

287
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Dread Wolf, referring to Solus.

288
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:02,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.

289
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:03,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:07,004
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the title that it was going to come out with in one of the working titles.

291
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:10,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

292
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Dragon Age the Dread Wolf sounds a lot cooler than Solus, and people who had never played were like, who the fuck is Solus?

293
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:18,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But they'd play a Dread Wolf game.

294
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:19,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

295
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

296
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:49,621
[SPEAKER_04]: moving on that has basically been replacing like my polya night and my retro night because I am into it and limiting myself to one night a week is slow and unfortunate torture which I may not limit myself I'm just saying I might do side quests and things because you know we can't have too many spoilers that's how I did 16 I said that's how I did 16 I played the main quest on stream and I did a side quest off stream

297
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: 5th Dream says, I played all of them and I'm still like, who the fuck is Solas?

298
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you not remember who Solas is?

299
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that conversation with Nick last night.

300
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, like, legit question.

301
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't beat any of the prior Dragon Age games.

302
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:04,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to play the Veil Guard.

303
00:26:05,004 --> 00:26:08,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about ready to just play this thing and see what makes sense and what doesn't.

304
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:10,047
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, is there a... Here's the thing.

305
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,908
[SPEAKER_09]: When I ask people, how should I prepare for Veil Guard?

306
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,531
[SPEAKER_09]: They say, well, you need to play Inquisition and you need to play... And I'm like, that's not realistic.

307
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:18,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you need to watch this three-hour YouTube.

308
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:19,893
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not realistic.

309
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:20,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

310
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:27,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, whether or not you want something short and simple, everybody is right.

311
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:32,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You really do need to go back and play through the previous game or at least watch highlights of it.

312
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely Trespasser is a big, big fucking huge part of it.

313
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:40,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I like the part where you said watch highlights.

314
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:41,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That I can do.

315
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I'm going to be perfectly honest that it's not a game that is an instant gratification kind of game.

316
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:57,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those... The series has been an entire slow burn up to this point.

317
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:57,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You know...

318
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:00,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the way I like it.

319
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:13,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I like having to go back and understand a very rich lore behind the game and see where they put in the little tidbits that were like a blink and miss it moment from a previous game.

320
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:19,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I was writing fan fiction for Inquisition, so I had to know ins and outs of it.

321
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:21,801
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was...

322
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:38,699
[SPEAKER_04]: it really, really is a worthy game and I'm kind of to the point where these games where you know there are there are CliffsNotes versions and honestly enough Rob, if you want the CliffsNotes

323
00:27:40,074 --> 00:28:07,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I will, I'll be happy to spill the stuff for you but there are some YouTube that would do it in 10 minutes or less just keep going, again, I understand there will be things that are deeper in the lore that, like you said, wink and nods that will go over my head, that is fine I just want to make sure I understand the story like, okay, so this person's bad, this person's good this is what they're fighting for, just the key things that will just get me through the game

324
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:13,798
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole series is not simple like that.

325
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to put it out there.

326
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got three games worth of lead up to this.

327
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:22,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, this feels like it's the big push.

328
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds like they're going to be doing another game after that.

329
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,732
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that there's no going to be post-release DLC.

330
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:28,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

331
00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:32,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're all on Mass Effect now, I believe.

332
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure that that's going.

333
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:41,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've actually, from what I understand, already have a small team working on spitballing story elements.

334
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:50,132
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me to sit and explain the points that would lead up to this...

335
00:28:51,491 --> 00:29:12,252
[SPEAKER_04]: would probably be at minimum 30 minutes for me to to go through those points and then I'd be like oh and by the way this happened that referred to this one I'm sorry I forgot to mention it blah blah blah um one thing too though is that you can do a really I'm just it's a spoiler but it's right at the beginning of the game so I'm just gonna say so um you can recreate your inquisitor

336
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:41,335
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think mine mine looked a lot like my Inquisitor did so I think it might have pulled from something I don't know but you can pick who they romanced who is what you chose at key points of the game how you treated Solas so those were all points that I think are the big affectations in this one

337
00:29:43,934 --> 00:30:10,772
[SPEAKER_09]: but yeah I mean I would be happy to give you the the recap but it's gonna be pretty long still because there are I'm gonna so many other things I'm gonna tell you what it is I'm gonna play the game and if I understand it great if I don't I'm gonna say when I talk about it next week review it do not play this if you haven't played the other games it's not worth buying like and so I I hope that is not how this game leaves me feeling that's just like and that's I would say the same thing about a movie

338
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:29,283
[SPEAKER_04]: you pretty much get thrust right into it now one thing I will say is that it's not necessary that you've read all the comics even though there are things from the comics that are in the game because the story has been very progressive the entire time like the whole uh

339
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:33,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say Apocrypha because it's not really.

340
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:33,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all canon.

341
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,773
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty involved.

342
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:41,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to discourage anyone from saying it.

343
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:43,398
[SPEAKER_04]: From playing it.

344
00:30:43,498 --> 00:30:44,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

345
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:52,186
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would suggest at the very least get familiar with what happened in Inquisition.

346
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:54,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get familiar with it.

347
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I can find a Wikipedia article or something.

348
00:30:58,372 --> 00:31:02,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I'd be happy to tell you stuff.

349
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, it's beautiful.

350
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:07,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

351
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:13,442
[SPEAKER_04]: They have done quite a bit to where you can just get right into the game.

352
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:14,783
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

353
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:20,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the races of people might not make sense.

354
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:28,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They do refer to certain terms that do require a little bit more familiarity with the Dragon Age universe.

355
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:37,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a glossary open and read the CliffsNotes of Inquisition, although it would still have been better had you played it.

356
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:38,241
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

357
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:41,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else for the game of the week?

358
00:31:43,073 --> 00:32:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: some Baldur's Gate 3 which honestly I didn't play the other two Baldur's Gate games just saying but I know D&D so that's how I got into that you raised an excellent point though yeah, Varric does give you a little bit of a background on it so there is that there is that alright Varric is our storyteller well then we'll move over to Loki, how was your gaming week?

359
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:32,174
[SPEAKER_02]: so this week I just played Minecraft really and edited video so I've got everything ready to go for my next episode which actually should be out tomorrow I'm pretty much done editing it so I did that and then of course Minecraft Adjacent I checked out that Oasis AI thing which is I don't know if you've seen it it's this

360
00:32:33,772 --> 00:33:01,117
[SPEAKER_02]: procedurally not even procedurally generated so completely like generated by AI Minecraft that you know plays about as well as you think it would in other words if you spin around it forgets what's behind you so uh it just it's all hallucination all the time but it has like some basic functionality in there where you can like place blocks and stuff granted as soon as you look away from those blocks it just hallucinates into something else but um

361
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:03,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something.

362
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

363
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:12,546
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the next generation of gaming that we were hoping for.

364
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:15,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just some AI experiment.

365
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,410
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about it.

366
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my gaming week.

367
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Way too much Diablo for us, always.

368
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:27,576
[SPEAKER_09]: But I actually got to the point where I beat the season, which is kind of fun.

369
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:29,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, yeah.

370
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:34,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's not talk about you in Dead by Daylight, but yes.

371
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:37,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we haven't had a call of that in a while, so I had to do it.

372
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:42,878
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, no, Diablo 4 has been fun and got up to Torment 3.

373
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:43,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I've cleared.

374
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:45,980
[SPEAKER_09]: All the quests and the seasonal progression.

375
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just about to tier 90, which is good because I do have some other games I want to play.

376
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:56,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And once I kind of finish out the Battle Pass, I'll be like, okay, I can put Diablo on hold until the next season starts in mid-January.

377
00:33:56,545 --> 00:34:01,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I think there's a patch for Final Fantasy XIV coming out very soon, which will probably get me back on that bullshit.

378
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:06,269
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I do have things like Dragon Age and other games I want to catch up on.

379
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,431
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, too many games, not enough time, as tends to be the case.

380
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:11,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

381
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:39,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, otherwise, uh, I hope Tigerclaw's out there because I'm going to mention that I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge last night.

382
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:47,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I was hanging out with one of my friends and we were like, hey, what can we play that's like, you know, on Game Pass or something that's not going to be like expensive to buy?

383
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:49,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, oh, let's play the Ninja Turtles game.

384
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,067
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be fun.

385
00:34:50,107 --> 00:34:51,328
[SPEAKER_09]: So we played through quite a bit of that.

386
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:52,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and that was a lot.

387
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:53,709
[SPEAKER_09]: That was, yeah, that was fun.

388
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:54,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I played as Leonardo.

389
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

390
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like I always did in the arcade machine.

391
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:59,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and honestly, it just, it just...

392
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:02,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It just felt like we were playing the 90s arcade game.

393
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:04,616
[SPEAKER_09]: It really did.

394
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:17,304
[SPEAKER_09]: There's obviously collectibles and things that are different, but for the most part, you know the fucking Shredder's Revenge if you've ever played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at an arcade or a pizza parlor at some point in your life.

395
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:24,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's fun, and if you have Game Pass, you should try it out, especially if you're in the situation I'm in where it's like, we need to play a multiplayer game.

396
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:25,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick, let's do it.

397
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:27,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's that.

398
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:34,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, I have been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, but that is about it for my gaming week.

399
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:39,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I should mention this, though, at some point, since I brought up the Nintendo Music app earlier in the show.

400
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:41,062
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of silly.

401
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:43,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I had my first TikTok.

402
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:44,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hold on.

403
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:45,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting coffee delivered.

404
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:46,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Alan.

405
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:46,828
[SPEAKER_09]: You're nice.

406
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:47,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

407
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:48,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Alan.

408
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:49,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's mine?

409
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie wants to know where her coffee is.

410
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:55,758
[SPEAKER_09]: He said the supermarket.

411
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:56,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

412
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so the Nintendo Music app.

413
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:10,486
[SPEAKER_09]: So I made a TikTok the day that Nintendo Music app came out because, you know, the Wii Shop music is in it, which is, you know, it's a banger.

414
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good suit.

415
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:21,732
[SPEAKER_09]: And I pasted this TikTok where I'm just staring off into space and that song is playing in the background and it says, I'm so glad the Nintendo Music app is that now I have music to disassociate properly to or something along those lines.

416
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:24,449
[SPEAKER_09]: That TikTok is up to 80,000 views.

417
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:33,175
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first thing I've ever had that went like in 20 fucking years that has gone like truly viral, which I think is really funny and random.

418
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:39,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So it just goes to show you never know what's going to be the thing that catches a lot of eyes.

419
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,941
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's it.

420
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,582
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't get it twisted.

421
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:47,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not suddenly monetized on TikTok or some sort of TikTok celebrity.

422
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:48,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

423
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:49,086
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

424
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:05,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's see.

425
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:14,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Over our Twitch chat, over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, TigerClaw asked if I did the new DLC.

426
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:18,003
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I could see that they were in there with Mona Lisa.

427
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:24,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, he didn't buy the DLC because the whole point was, let's play something we already have or is part of our subscription.

428
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:27,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So he didn't pay for the DLC because we were at his house.

429
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,491
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was the whole thing.

430
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:31,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was fun.

431
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:31,973
[SPEAKER_09]: We had fun playing the game.

432
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's it for my gaming week.

433
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:38,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on and get into some gaming news.

434
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:44,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki with some news I think we all kind of expected, but it's disappointing all the same.

435
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:45,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Get into it.

436
00:37:47,048 --> 00:38:05,304
[SPEAKER_02]: yep so uh Fire Rock Studios is shutting down this is what happens when Sony buys you I guess uh so they the team responsible for the game Concord which did not do well and they pulled it off the marketplace and we had hoped oh maybe they're retooling it for like a free to play nope nope

437
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:07,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Not happening at all.

438
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:16,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they said certain aspects of Concord were exceptional but others did not land with enough players and as a result we took the game offline.

439
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:27,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a considerable amount of time these past few months exploring all of our options and after much thought we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.

440
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:32,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit, and dedication.

441
00:38:32,793 --> 00:39:02,445
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's not enough to keep your studio around I guess I mean I would really love to see like kind of a behind the scenes development of this like how this came about like is it feels like if this is like bad corporate decision all over it and then of course the devs get to pay for it it's the wrong people paying the price for the bad decisions once again in gaming are we surprised

442
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:28,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm not going to say who, but somebody I know who worked in the gaming industry, I say worked because unfortunately this individual was laid off relatively recently, posted a very funny video on his Facebook, it wasn't like actually funny, it was like a parody thing that was like mimicking the boardroom at a gaming company that was talking about all these like, you know, let's, it's obviously all these shitty things that companies have done over the years.

443
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:34,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make the battle pass half as long, and then that way we can get twice as much money out of it.

444
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,411
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all these things.

445
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:39,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's the one guy that's sitting there going, what about games just fucking being fun?

446
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're all looking at him like he's wacky.

447
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:54,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though, as funny because it's true as that whole thing was, I look at that guy and go, oh, by him, he's Baldur's Gate 3.

448
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,085
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

449
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:28,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably was made for some sort of live service element that they threw out the window and kind of thought, how can we salvage this sort of thing?

450
00:40:29,215 --> 00:40:30,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get that impression of them.

451
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:31,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

452
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:36,898
[SPEAKER_09]: But well, what we can say is that Dragon Age doesn't have it in there.

453
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:48,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it was once planned to be in there or not, it's not there, which is a promising sort of viewpoint that maybe the person who is saying, do we have to nickel and dime every damn thing?

454
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:53,008
[SPEAKER_09]: or can paying $70 for the game just be enough and we sell lots based on that fact.

455
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's that whole thing.

456
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:05,861
[SPEAKER_09]: But Bobby said it very succinctly on his show before us tonight and I would tend to agree that the bubble on the live service game has burst.

457
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:12,380
[SPEAKER_09]: as tends to be the case with all of the trends that gaming companies chase.

458
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:23,207
[SPEAKER_09]: MMOs, remember when so many companies were putting out MMOs because everybody thought they had the next Warcraft and some of them got a hell of a lot closer than others.

459
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:28,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them like, of course, I can't even remember their names now.

460
00:41:29,091 --> 00:41:32,653
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Warhammer game that did all right.

461
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:36,836
[SPEAKER_09]: There was the, oh, I can't remember the name of that MMO.

462
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:38,556
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

463
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:57,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It really searched during the pandemic.

464
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:03,829
[SPEAKER_09]: VobiKurt and Phil of Nine is VO by Kurt, but I affectionately say VobiKurt.

465
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:04,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And hello to you both.

466
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,912
[SPEAKER_09]: VobiKurt says Guild Wars was okay and Phil of Nine says Guild Wars too.

467
00:42:08,252 --> 00:42:12,615
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why I'm excluding Guild Wars from the MMO considering y'all aren't wrong.

468
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:40,815
[SPEAKER_09]: but neither of those games had the monthly fee and I think that's the thing that kind of but I guess to be fair there were a lot of free to play MMOs that came out in that period too and they all flopped because the market was just flooded with them and none of them really were able to stand out in that same sort of way the only one that really was Final Fantasy 14 feels like the only one that was able to get an 11 I guess that's able to charge a monthly fee and EverQuest is still kicking to be fair so

469
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:46,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a couple others out there, but none nearly with that same success as World of Warcraft.

470
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:58,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I feel like there's a lot of games, you know, and maybe to a lesser predatory feeling extent, there is a hell of a lot of Minecraft clones for a hot minute.

471
00:42:58,612 --> 00:42:59,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't you agree, Loki?

472
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:00,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we're still seeing some of those.

473
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:02,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's still a thing.

474
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:04,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Minecraft clones are kind of a thing.

475
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever Nintendo's doing.

476
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:06,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

477
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:34,724
[SPEAKER_02]: yes yes very much to that whatever Nintendo uh remember uh 3D.GameHeroes which was like literally Zelda that was yeah I was gonna say that's not so much Minecraft that's more just uh voxels are popular and then they made them a Zelda game is essentially it's it's legally distinct Zelda game um which I still think that game's great I wish that was ported to PC uh because I don't want to play it on the PlayStation 3 yeah

478
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:45,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, but now my point is the live service game, everybody's trying to do one and there's only so much space.

479
00:43:45,213 --> 00:43:55,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Like just everybody thinks, oh, we can just copy paste the model, make cool characters and kids are going to eat them up because they're cool because they got big guns and they float around and it's pretty and the maps have

480
00:43:55,763 --> 00:44:25,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Lens Flares and 4K and 8K and lighting effects and blah blah blah and dumb kids are going to eat it up and give us all their money and Battle Pass and we're going to have really cool cosmetics that are just palette swaps of things it's like no, the bubble has burst on that my friends, it is very hard now to have a game that can have a sustainable Battle Pass Diablo 4 has one but I would bet very few people use the Battle Pass in Diablo, very few of course, Dead by Daylight is one that is successful but

481
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:29,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Dead by Daylight's kind of, you know, again, is sort of an anomaly.

482
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:36,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've seen how many 4v1 games kind of come and go or kind of are treading water.

483
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:42,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I know Texas Chainsaw Massacre is still a thing because Alan still really likes that game, but I feel like that game's treading water.

484
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:44,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's not really a big thing.

485
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:45,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I hardly see anyone playing it.

486
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:47,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

487
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:53,348
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, there was Killer Clowns, which got Elvira, which is cool, but I can't say I've seen many Twitch people doing that.

488
00:44:54,548 --> 00:45:13,519
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know but you know it's just I feel like it's just always kind of chasing what came before it and when it comes to live service games and a lot of money Concord was chasing it and the money just wasn't there the demand wasn't there for something like that it's just it's like yeah it once again with any of those things that are trying to

489
00:45:15,202 --> 00:45:43,821
[SPEAKER_02]: be like something else you have to make yourself distinct enough to like why are people going to want to choose you over what is essentially the you know thing that you're copying you know in some games like for example like there's Hytale which is I don't think ever going to come out but it's essentially Hypixel which was a Minecraft server they're trying to spin it off into their own game that is

490
00:45:44,461 --> 00:46:13,295
[SPEAKER_02]: like Minecraft but not but is um so it's just it's like not but is it is I mean it's pretty close uh yes but no but yes yes but no but yes but no but no uh but yeah you have to like what's gonna bring them to that game and then fortunately with Concord it was like it wasn't really anything it's like yeah we're doing what this game's doing and this one's doing and this one's doing but we have a storyline that's weekly it's like

491
00:46:14,924 --> 00:46:17,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, Cap, I don't care about your characters.

492
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:19,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who your characters are.

493
00:46:20,086 --> 00:46:21,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I want to watch it?

494
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:29,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like, you know, imagine Marvel comes out with a brand new TV show featuring brand new heroes you have never heard of.

495
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,850
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in comics.

496
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:32,571
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in anything.

497
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:33,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a TV show.

498
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:35,272
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to sign it on for four seasons.

499
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, I don't know if I want to watch that.

500
00:46:38,153 --> 00:46:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know who these are yet.

501
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:40,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

502
00:46:42,938 --> 00:47:10,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking like literally my entire timeline on Blue Sky is so gay for Agatha all along and I understand she's in the comics but I feel like it's a lot of it's not Agatha they are going crazy for Agatha and Aubrey Plaza but it's fucking Patti LuPone the fucking queen of theater and cinema in that show in particular and I don't know if she played a character that was from the comics or I don't know enough about Marvel but I just know that

503
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,547
[SPEAKER_09]: That people are losing their fucking mind over that show.

504
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:17,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand, like, it's apparently, like, it's literally for the girls' gays and bays.

505
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:20,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And even straight guys will appreciate it, you know?

506
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:23,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's a pretty good show, from my understanding.

507
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Yeah, basically, it's like you're...

508
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it sounds like a lot of those like Kickstarters you know the pitches for a game where they're like yeah we're gonna I mean Mighty No.

509
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:49,131
[SPEAKER_02]: 9 perfect example yeah we're gonna have this game come out but then we're also due to the comic book and an animated series and a movie and a this and we're gonna have plushies and it's like

510
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:52,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but like, is the game going to be good, though?

511
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:57,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because I don't want to watch it and consume any of this other stuff if the game's not going to be good.

512
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:04,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game was all right, but it wasn't offering anything that the other services weren't.

513
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:14,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, they wanted, you know, a $40 mission fee to this, which is, you know, you got to really deliver then if you're asking for money up front.

514
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

515
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let me get to some chat comments, because there's some good stuff here in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

516
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:26,136
[SPEAKER_09]: VobiKurt says, it's a bit different, but casual game battle pass and premium pass type things still rake in some decent money.

517
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:33,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Good point, because a lot of like free games, especially like Pokemon type of things, you know, you see a lot of battle passes and those that do well.

518
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:39,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think a lot of those games, especially when you say casual, they start as free, so it feels a little easier.

519
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:43,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, even something like Dead by Daylight, I would argue they practically give away for free.

520
00:48:44,585 --> 00:49:06,145
[SPEAKER_09]: several times a year so you know that I but I think that's part of the reason for that game's particular success is they money's in the DLC yeah they made it pretty easy to get on board I love this comment from the break man and I don't know how much you're gonna hear that sentence on the show just kidding friend but you got I I this comment is on point this is a this is a gold star comment from of all people the break man you ready

521
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:09,969
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like OnlyFans... Oh, I'm not supposed to say that word on Twitch.

522
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:12,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like OF, the website.

523
00:49:13,252 --> 00:49:17,116
[SPEAKER_09]: If you aren't famous already, you are more than likely wasting your time.

524
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:19,258
[SPEAKER_09]: That is...

525
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:24,387
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

526
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me use it in another sentence.

527
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,643
[SPEAKER_09]: CharlieXCX makes music for Girls, Gays, and Thays.

528
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:52,504
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't mean that other people are excluded from the party.

529
00:49:52,544 --> 00:49:56,387
[SPEAKER_09]: It just means like, oh, this one really feels relatable to the Girls, Gays, and Thays.

530
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:59,088
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you know what I'm talking about, right?

531
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:00,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

532
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally know.

533
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:05,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a video game for the Girls, Gays, and Thays?

534
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:06,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Dead by Daylight.

535
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:06,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

536
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

537
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Right in front of my salad.

538
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,140
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

539
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:11,940
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

540
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:22,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's move on and talk about Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, making songs for girls, gays, and Beyonce.

541
00:50:24,385 --> 00:50:25,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's Dolly Parton.

542
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:32,519
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

543
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

544
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

545
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:39,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about... Oh, this beta came out this weekend.

546
00:50:39,263 --> 00:50:40,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually checked it out.

547
00:50:40,243 --> 00:50:41,664
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Monster Hunter Wilds.

548
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:44,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I've kind of cooled down on the mobile phone game lately.

549
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:48,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I still enjoy... I'm playing too much other shit on mobile phone, like between Ingress and Pokemon.

550
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:51,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I play a lot of mobile phone shit, right?

551
00:50:51,608 --> 00:51:00,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't even talk about the Pokemon trading card game I downloaded and got into this week, which is not a literal translation of the actual trading card game.

552
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:01,913
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

553
00:51:21,218 --> 00:51:24,740
[SPEAKER_09]: But because I do enjoy Monster Hunter now on mobile, I was like, you know what?

554
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to try getting into a Monster Hunter game again.

555
00:51:27,062 --> 00:51:36,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I heard that Monster Hunter Wilds got an open beta on PlayStation 5 or like a test run or something, which I think was only running for a few days.

556
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:40,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think, yeah, it was only run through October 31st.

557
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:45,974
[SPEAKER_09]: The open beta for other platforms like Steam started the other day and ends tomorrow.

558
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:49,537
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you haven't checked this out, like on Steam or something, you don't have a lot of time left.

559
00:51:49,997 --> 00:51:50,497
[SPEAKER_09]: DirtyPillows DirtyPillows

560
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see your dirty pillows.

561
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:21,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Their breasts, mama.

562
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:29,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, but these dirty pillows, or whatever you want to call them, are what you end up fighting in the game instead of the spiders, which is cool.

563
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:33,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have arachnophobia to that extent.

564
00:52:33,232 --> 00:52:41,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like spiders a lot, but I don't have it to this extreme where I can't have them in a game, so it's hard for me to say how it makes me feel because I can't relate to...

565
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:43,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Like completely shutting down because of it.

566
00:52:44,002 --> 00:52:45,464
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know that's a thing for some people.

567
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:47,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's cool.

568
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:50,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always about more people being able to play the games.

569
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:51,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

570
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:53,434
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

571
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:18,213
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

572
00:53:34,155 --> 00:53:37,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, very cool to see that type of accessibility feature and other stuff too.

573
00:53:37,377 --> 00:53:39,338
[SPEAKER_09]: There was color blindness features in there too.

574
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:41,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought really smart.

575
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Text, you can change the text size and it says, are you going to be playing this game?

576
00:53:46,503 --> 00:53:50,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want text size for a monitor or do you want text size for a television?

577
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:58,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was really smart because they're basically saying, do you want it like you're sitting right in front of the screen playing it or like you're sitting in your living room playing it on the TV and you need the text bigger?

578
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:00,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Smart, smart, smart.

579
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:03,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like that developers are really thinking about all these things in their games.

580
00:54:03,918 --> 00:54:10,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe I'm a little hyped for a Monster Hunter game finally for the first time in my life, but I think I am a little bit.

581
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:14,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of want to check this out, depending on what else is going on at the time.

582
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:27,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and SHO100Map talking about the Pokemon Trading Card Game saying, post your Pokemon Trading Card Game friend codes in the VOG Discord, folks, in the Let's Game Together section.

583
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:28,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I will do that.

584
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:30,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I will put my code there for y'all.

585
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:34,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Just please, if you're going to add me, send me a message with your name because...

586
00:54:35,091 --> 00:55:01,051
[SPEAKER_09]: the unfortunate thing about the trading card game is that if you do a wonder trade or whatever they call it with somebody random online there's an option right there to add somebody as a friend and those like I'm not trying to be a jerk but I really just want my friends list to be people I actually at least know a little bit or at least I know like oh that's a no LR person or that's a you know blue sky person or you know whatever it is like just just tell me who you are and it's I'll add you it's no big deal so I'll put my code in there um after the show tonight

587
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:03,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's move on.

588
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:04,978
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, I love this story.

589
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:08,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we knew it was inevitable, didn't we?

590
00:55:12,164 --> 00:55:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we joke about running Linux on things.

591
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:18,088
[SPEAKER_04]: The other joke is about Doom running on things.

592
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:21,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone has put Doom...

593
00:55:22,342 --> 00:55:24,865
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Nintendo Sound Clock Alarmo.

594
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:30,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is a playable version of Doom.

595
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:36,716
[SPEAKER_04]: You load the level, you walk around, you use the right side button to fire at enemies.

596
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:43,582
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was done by a programmer named Gary Otternich.

597
00:55:45,004 --> 00:55:48,286
[SPEAKER_04]: The German for night, I guess.

598
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:58,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really, since it's only like 2.39 megabytes, it's not really hard to make it run on a lot of things.

599
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:05,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, reading this got me on a deep dive of other things that Doom has run on.

600
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:11,923
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have a list, a small list, if you want to know some of them.

601
00:56:11,943 --> 00:56:13,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what are some of the highlights?

602
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:17,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I imagine that list has got to be like hundreds of things long, but what are some of the highlights?

603
00:56:18,486 --> 00:56:19,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It runs within Outer Wilds.

604
00:56:19,987 --> 00:56:34,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It runs on an iPod Classic and an iPod Mini, an Amazon Fire TV stick, a Samsung dishwasher, a Porsche 911, a parking kiosk, on a digital camera, on a pregnancy test,

605
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:42,239
[SPEAKER_04]: on a MacBook Pro Touch Bar, Treadmill, a Ticket Validator on a vape.

606
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It's run on a vape.

607
00:56:46,242 --> 00:56:49,044
[SPEAKER_04]: The best one to me is the pregnancy test.

608
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:54,047
[SPEAKER_04]: A thermostat on a Sony Ericsson K800i.

609
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:57,690
[SPEAKER_09]: The pregnancy test is so wild to me.

610
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

611
00:56:58,971 --> 00:57:01,193
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got it running on an Apple Watch on a chainsaw.

612
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:08,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chainsaw that's got like a digital settings thing on it on an S Classic.

613
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone got it into Sonic Mania.

614
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:15,811
[SPEAKER_04]: To play on one of the little bonus TVs.

615
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:18,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they got Doom running inside Doom?

616
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:21,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm pretty sure that's... I think that's already a thing.

617
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:24,373
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got it running in Morrowind as well.

618
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:29,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But my favorite is the pregnancy test because it's really just like very...

619
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:34,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiny, black and white, you know, complete monochrome.

620
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:37,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's absolutely hilarious.

621
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like what Fifth Dream says, pregnancy test, you are doomed.

622
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:47,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it's just the display, so you can't actually play it on the pregnancy test.

623
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:48,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Still.

624
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:49,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

625
00:57:49,694 --> 00:57:53,337
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Alarmo is actually running Doom for real.

626
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the thing.

627
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:57,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that it has to make practical sense, y'all.

628
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:01,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that it has to be something where you can say, I did it.

629
00:58:01,923 --> 00:58:03,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I got Doom on the pregnancy test.

630
00:58:03,785 --> 00:58:04,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it.

631
00:58:05,126 --> 00:58:11,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's our top three things that we would love to see Doom running on that isn't currently running on

632
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:15,691
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, Rob, I have found Doom running within Doom.

633
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:17,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, of course.

634
00:58:17,973 --> 00:58:20,174
[SPEAKER_04]: In the DOS version of Doom, so there you go.

635
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:24,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Top three things that we want to see Doom running on that it isn't already running on yet?

636
00:58:25,758 --> 00:58:26,799
[SPEAKER_09]: That should have been the listless.

637
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:31,922
[SPEAKER_09]: The PDF version of Trump's jail sentence.

638
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:33,363
Hmm.

639
00:58:35,399 --> 00:58:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna say one that's a little bit more serious.

640
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:40,425
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vegas Sphere.

641
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:42,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, The Sphere in Vegas.

642
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, The Vegas Sphere.

643
00:58:44,249 --> 00:58:45,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's a good one.

644
00:58:45,891 --> 00:58:50,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Doom has already been running on an ATM so we can cross that off of the list.

645
00:58:50,637 --> 00:58:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too fast.

646
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

647
00:58:55,672 --> 00:58:57,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's been on an arcade one.

648
00:58:57,772 --> 00:59:00,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's the thing.

649
00:59:00,673 --> 00:59:03,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, Doom probably already runs on most of these things.

650
00:59:03,233 --> 00:59:06,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not well aware of everything that Doom runs on.

651
00:59:06,054 --> 00:59:06,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Half-Life 3, funny.

652
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh hey, that's a good way to get Half-Life 3.

653
00:59:10,855 --> 00:59:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if Doom could run on my PC cooler because it has a screen on it.

654
00:59:18,776 --> 00:59:19,536
[SPEAKER_02]: This is USB.

655
00:59:20,236 --> 00:59:21,417
[SPEAKER_09]: How about an Etch-A-Sketch?

656
00:59:22,557 --> 00:59:23,457
[SPEAKER_02]: An Etch-A-Sketch?

657
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:50,928
[SPEAKER_04]: so people have got it running on there's a whole reddit discussion on someone's got it running on SimBoss so Amstrad CPC Sinclair, they've got them running I've got it, Doom running on my neighbor's Christmas lights oh that would be amazing that would be probably possible Commodore VIC-20 of course

658
00:59:54,108 --> 01:00:17,032
[SPEAKER_09]: um all right all right well can they get Doom running in this next game I'm sure somebody's already trying it but Loki this is a game we don't really talk about very often on OLR but I know you you know it's it's a game that is important it's been a while it's been a while I haven't so I haven't played Black Ops since Black Ops 2 tell us what's going on with Call of Duty I can't believe I just said those words aloud but what's going on with Call of Duty

659
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty is coming in clutch for slow news weeks.

660
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:26,361
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but they just launched Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and apparently it's doing well.

661
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:28,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it doing well?

662
01:00:28,603 --> 01:00:33,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is going to be such a shocker, but it's because it's on Game Pass.

663
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:34,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!

664
01:00:35,919 --> 01:00:36,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that!

665
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:41,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's reached, um, they've had the biggest Call of Duty 3D opening weekend ever.

666
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, the most players, most hours played, and most total matches.

667
01:00:50,642 --> 01:00:53,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're number one across the board, I guess, for that stuff.

668
01:00:54,402 --> 01:01:05,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I mean, yeah, that's what happens when you give the game away, not for free, but with, you know, a service that doesn't cost much each month, and so, like, I could play it if I wanted to, and

669
01:01:06,022 --> 01:01:09,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, because... I don't know.

670
01:01:09,744 --> 01:01:10,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I should.

671
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:11,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to like the campaigns.

672
01:01:13,046 --> 01:01:13,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Online, no.

673
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:14,327
[SPEAKER_02]: No thanks.

674
01:01:15,747 --> 01:01:18,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesson played with my friends, but... Yeah.

675
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

676
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good that it's doing well.

677
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:25,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess that sort of kind of justifies the spending billions of dollars.

678
01:01:25,873 --> 01:01:29,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing it's one of the biggest investments Microsoft's ever made, it's good to see it's doing well, yeah.

679
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:29,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

680
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:32,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so $69 billion.

681
01:01:35,023 --> 01:01:41,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's doing so well that you're not going to have to lay off more people at the end of the year, right?

682
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:43,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

683
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:44,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

684
01:01:45,274 --> 01:01:45,834
[SPEAKER_02]: The silence?

685
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:47,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Not hearing it?

686
01:01:50,612 --> 01:01:51,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Psy.

687
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:51,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

688
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:52,732
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

689
01:01:53,132 --> 01:01:58,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of Psy's, get ready to let out a big one because I, this doesn't compute.

690
01:01:58,553 --> 01:01:59,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't make sense.

691
01:02:00,074 --> 01:02:02,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not surprised, but it doesn't make sense.

692
01:02:02,354 --> 01:02:02,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

693
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:06,335
[SPEAKER_02]: To circle back to Doom running in Black Ops.

694
01:02:06,715 --> 01:02:06,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

695
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:12,696
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but Wolfenstein, I think, was in Black, or no, was that Pitfall?

696
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:13,436
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those.

697
01:02:13,976 --> 01:02:14,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Pitfall, I think.

698
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:16,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Pitfall, being an old school Activision game, was.

699
01:02:17,297 --> 01:02:17,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

700
01:02:18,057 --> 01:02:18,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

701
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:18,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

702
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:18,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

703
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:19,876
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

704
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:23,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, back to what I was saying about this is annoying.

705
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:28,561
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about the PlayStation 5 and talking about accessories like the plates.

706
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:34,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So plates that you buy for the PlayStation 5 Slim, they don't work with the PlayStation 5 Pro.

707
01:02:35,225 --> 01:02:38,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And while you might go, well, I guess that makes sense because they're different sizes, right?

708
01:02:39,248 --> 01:02:40,909
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're not different sizes.

709
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:42,530
[SPEAKER_09]: They are the same size.

710
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:44,518
[SPEAKER_09]: 3D printing you back.

711
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:09,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that might be possible, actually.

712
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:14,744
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't share an image of the PlayStation 5 Pro itself because that is not out until later this week.

713
01:03:15,144 --> 01:03:19,386
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, they're already out there in the wild and this obviously made its way to Reddit.

714
01:03:19,886 --> 01:03:26,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have different interlocking teeth to make them not compatible even though they are the same.

715
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,591
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems unnecessary.

716
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:32,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like...

717
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:56,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Losing, like, intentionally not having value for the sake of not having value and making you buy more Although, I don't know how many people out there would have both a slim and a pro But I guess it's possible, it's possible Well, it's not even necessarily that, like, what if you heard, you know, it's like, oh, these are the same size, I'm just gonna buy one anyways Mm-hmm

718
01:03:56,751 --> 01:04:17,984
[SPEAKER_02]: and and you buy it or like hey you had a PlayStation Slim and you sold it yeah and you get a pro and you have these face plates that fit and it's like oh no haha you gotta buy more like well you don't have to but it's annoying right it didn't work but if you wanted to look the way you want to look like I would just

719
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:19,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't.

720
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:20,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't buy more.

721
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:25,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just take the L and just realize that this is what Sony's gonna do.

722
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't buy the plates.

723
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:28,251
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my plan.

724
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:32,151
[SPEAKER_04]: LBSTL files out before too long anyway, so it's not gonna be a thing.

725
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:33,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are.

726
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:35,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's spiteful just to do this.

727
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:36,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's the point?

728
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:42,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, I'm sure they'll make some excuse like, well, it's just, you know, to make them stay on better or something like that.

729
01:04:42,893 --> 01:04:43,073
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's...

730
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that should have come up a long time.

731
01:04:49,413 --> 01:04:58,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if you had designed with some semblance of backwards compatibility with the other consoles in mind, and I know it's weird to talk about backwards compatibility in the same generation, but I am.

732
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,642
[SPEAKER_09]: But that just tells me I'm not buying faceplates for PlayStation.

733
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:02,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should I?

734
01:05:04,464 --> 01:05:05,885
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for the PSA, Reddit.

735
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:06,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

736
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:35,259
[SPEAKER_02]: well here's another let's put our tinfoil hats on now so here's another one so you know how they've been making faceplates and stuff for Sony is the only one to be able to make faceplates for their system they will not license it out and they will sue other people that will do that that said dbrand said fuck you guys we're going to do it anyways and they did so now these won't work with that system

737
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what's going on in Nintendo's world?

738
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:08,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was a big switch error that was preventing people from making purchases in the eShop.

739
01:06:10,188 --> 01:06:15,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like it was really getting in the way of people being able to...

740
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:36,786
[SPEAKER_04]: you use the holiday sales so Nintendo said that they've got it resolved all the servers are functioning normally and they've got it addressed this was actually starting though on the 31st when people were trying to make those purchases it was an error code 2813-5304

741
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:51,037
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's the type of error that shows up if they have the incorrect zip code on their billing address so um but it's fixed

742
01:06:52,694 --> 01:06:55,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anything about going back to the sales.

743
01:06:57,396 --> 01:07:08,902
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a week-long sale that offered on like 40 different games and DLC for Zombies Battle for Neighborville Complete Edition, like Star Wars Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition, things like that.

744
01:07:11,123 --> 01:07:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people are fussing about having missed out on some of the time for the sale.

745
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:20,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see how Nintendo addresses that part.

746
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:22,940
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

747
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:26,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even look to buy anything.

748
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:27,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

749
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:29,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really used the eShop in a while.

750
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:34,484
[SPEAKER_09]: There hasn't been anything out like super recently anyway that I wanted to pick up directly from the eShop.

751
01:07:34,544 --> 01:07:41,946
[SPEAKER_09]: But bummer for people that want to take advantage of the sale because usually there's lots of scary games involved with that.

752
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:42,446
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

753
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:47,248
[SPEAKER_04]: To quote Kelly's dad, fiscal responsibility.

754
01:07:48,294 --> 01:07:55,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was going to say, the thing I've been most tempted to get on the Switch around Halloween was that Rocky Horror game that came out on the Switch and Steam.

755
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm told it is still not out on PlayStation and Xbox.

756
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:00,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It is planned.

757
01:08:00,462 --> 01:08:11,709
[SPEAKER_09]: The developer wrote an interesting series of bleats this week on Blue Sky that basically apologized for the delay, saying that he just has... I think it's all made by one guy, or at least the bulk of it is made by one individual.

758
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:12,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

759
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,852
[SPEAKER_09]: It just sounds like they weren't able to get things done on the timetable.

760
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:18,413
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted to get them done, but it's still coming.

761
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:21,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, Rocky Horror doesn't have to just be a Halloween thing.

762
01:08:21,876 --> 01:08:23,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it'll be done when it's done.

763
01:08:23,176 --> 01:08:26,459
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to pick it up on PlayStation 5, but I almost got it on Switch.

764
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:29,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And that probably would have stopped me from doing that.

765
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a bummer.

766
01:08:34,304 --> 01:08:34,664
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

767
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:36,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

768
01:08:36,405 --> 01:08:38,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of other things going on in the Switch, Loki.

769
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:51,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so we've got word now, the surprise announcement, I guess, that Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition is coming to the Switch on March 20th, 2025.

770
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:56,678
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to have enhanced visuals and new story elements.

771
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:05,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, the first time it's been on the Switch, or the first time it's been out since the Wii U, and it hasn't been available for a long time.

772
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:08,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be on the next Switch console as well?

773
01:09:08,847 --> 01:09:09,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

774
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:29,314
[SPEAKER_09]: but getting kind of close to the release of that so maybe you never know I did like XTX so I'll be curious to check this out on the Switch I don't know if I have time for all these games but I like to think I might sometimes you just gotta pick your battles yeah right

775
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:36,452
[SPEAKER_09]: PrincePeachFuzz in chat says, would there ever be an OLR Rocky Horror stream?

776
01:09:37,693 --> 01:09:39,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that, I mean, because we can't really play the movie on here.

777
01:09:39,953 --> 01:09:44,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you're talking about the game, I'll probably stream the game on my personal channel when it comes out on PlayStation.

778
01:09:45,354 --> 01:09:48,395
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as like a full OLR production, I don't know.

779
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:51,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if we want to get to, it's not multiplayer though.

780
01:09:51,496 --> 01:09:52,616
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only thing that's kind of a bummer.

781
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:55,897
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was, I would say, sure, we could try to get together and do it.

782
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:57,217
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

783
01:09:57,987 --> 01:10:25,652
[SPEAKER_09]: so but I just want to play the game so I'm excited it'll be out on PlayStation 5 but I think achievements and trophies are the things that are holding it up they're not quite in the game yet because they're not in the Switch version of the game and they have to be there for PlayStation and Xbox it's part of their that's the thing it's like so silly that like why that hasn't been implemented on the Switch so far like I mean it's too late now but like but maybe not for the successor certainly that should be something for the successor it's like

784
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:44,867
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else has them but you I know I know it's like okay well trust me I've been making a whole thing out of retro achievements and it's like if only Nintendo embraced this stuff within Nintendo Switch Online it would be really cool but they're a decade behind so you know what was 10 years ago okay 2014 what's the peak 2014 online infrastructure goes out there

785
01:10:51,687 --> 01:10:51,987
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

786
01:11:08,366 --> 01:11:13,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on November 8th, the second expansion, The Last Console War, is going to be available.

787
01:11:14,391 --> 01:11:17,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And my understanding is this is something you just get.

788
01:11:18,133 --> 01:11:23,497
[SPEAKER_09]: You get this, oh no, Atari VCS gets it as a free update early next year.

789
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:27,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is free DLC for everybody else.

790
01:11:27,861 --> 01:11:33,365
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be something, I can't tell if this is something that you have to pay for or not.

791
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:36,287
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to assume you do because we had to for the last one.

792
01:11:36,907 --> 01:11:37,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's pretty rich.

793
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:43,772
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be adding 19 more games and 8 video interviews talking about Atari versus Intellivision.

794
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:45,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the interesting thing.

795
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:50,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually focusing on Mattel making games for Atari systems.

796
01:11:50,617 --> 01:11:59,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So no, it does not have Intellivision games in it by name, but it does have what Mattel started making for the M network.

797
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:01,205
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of interesting.

798
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:04,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we get a big chunk of those games, which include...

799
01:12:05,308 --> 01:12:33,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Air Raiders, AntBear, Armor Ambush, Astro Blast, Frogs and Flies, International Soccer, Dark Cavern, Star Strike, Super Challenge Baseball and Football, Sword Fight, Sea Battle, Tower of Mystery, Video Pinball, Basketball, Hardball, oh these are some other uh sorry those were all the M Network games and then we have Video Pinball, Basketball, Hardball, Final Legacy, Zari Arena, and Desert Falcon for the 7800 are all coming out as well so that's kind of neat um

800
01:12:34,927 --> 01:13:03,545
[SPEAKER_09]: that that is all coming this week and that when all is said and done I think that means there will be 130 games in Atari 50 so good on them you know we've talked a lot about preservation and I realize like that's kind of Atari's whole MO right now is really just like trying to make the most of their legacy content which has had mixed results some of it's been very good some of it's not so good but Atari 50 and you know the things that Digital Eclipse has been doing ever since they kind of became a part of that whole family is

801
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:27,451
[SPEAKER_09]: is good I think Atari 50 is great so this adding value to that whole thing I think is really cool and it's admittedly a part that I know nothing about like of course I know about Intellivision I had no idea Mattel was making games for Atari at some point in the process so I think that's really cool so I think everybody was at one point yeah so yeah it's true it's true all right well since I brought up retro games it's a great time to go into our next segment

802
01:13:38,092 --> 01:13:45,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

803
01:13:45,858 --> 01:13:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

804
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,383
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit of the logo coming in there.

805
01:13:52,504 --> 01:14:00,030
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, once a month here on the show in 2024, we talk about the classic cancelled game of the month.

806
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So a game that never was.

807
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,454
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic cancelled game this week?

808
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:11,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish I had more footage of this to show everybody, but it's Sam and Max Freelance Police.

809
01:14:13,419 --> 01:14:19,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a graphic adventure game that was developed by LucasArts from 2002 until 2004.

810
01:14:20,848 --> 01:14:25,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be the final game in their whole adventure game era.

811
01:14:27,394 --> 01:14:35,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It was intended to be released for Windows in early 2004 as a sequel to the 1993 version Sam & Max Hit the Road.

812
01:14:36,058 --> 01:14:38,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And based, of course, on the comics.

813
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:45,622
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, this actually involved the series creator Steve Purcell during this.

814
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:47,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It was showcased at E3 2023, announced August 2002.

815
01:14:51,845 --> 01:15:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was supposed to be a point-and-click game, but instead of using stuff like SCUMM and GrimE, it actually had a 3D engine, so it was a full 3D point-and-click.

816
01:15:02,796 --> 01:15:10,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually led by Michael Stemmel, who was one of the original designers for Sam & Max Hit the Road.

817
01:15:11,044 --> 01:15:11,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

818
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:38,364
[SPEAKER_04]: it really disappointed a lot of people when it was cancelled and one really sad thing about this is that this was one of the preludes to LucasArts cancelling their adventure game division but a lot of the people who worked on this game actually went to form Telltale Games

819
01:15:39,745 --> 01:15:41,487
[SPEAKER_04]: and kept creating adventure games.

820
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:50,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Purcell moved Sam & Max to Telltale in 2005 to help revive the Sam & Max video games.

821
01:15:51,835 --> 01:16:16,749
[SPEAKER_04]: so anyway like I said this was a graphic point and click 3D graphics, real time rendered and the game engine had things from other LucasArts games like from Gladius or Full Throttle Hell on Wheels or Star Wars Obi-Wan fully shaded bump map, light map, everything but it was meant to give it a 2D feel to a 3D game

822
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:27,258
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was supposed to follow a different control scheme from things like Grim Fandago and Escape from Monkey Island but it was a point and click.

823
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:42,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It had minigames, some of them optional, some compulsory and it was designed so that you would not die or reach a dead end so you could always find your way out of something.

824
01:16:44,374 --> 01:17:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was described as being six stories held together by a single overarching plot and they were each a separate case for the freelance police including a space station and going to a neo-pagan bacchanal bad guy stuff all kinds of just weirdness because I mean hey it's a it's Sam and Max so

825
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:37,639
[SPEAKER_04]: LucasArts actually had considered releasing the game episodic but because of all the stuff going into it they wanted to do it as one single traditional distribution and there were supposed to be some power-ups in the game and new interactive cases as DLC but it didn't happen so anyway

826
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:50,435
[SPEAKER_04]: LucasArts didn't put really a whole lot of detail out there when they announced the game, but they still projected it to be an early 2004.

827
01:17:51,235 --> 01:17:55,939
[SPEAKER_04]: They presented the trailer, which is what we have for those who are watching live.

828
01:17:58,482 --> 01:18:01,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It had the original voice actors, Bill Farmer, Nick Jameson.

829
01:18:02,604 --> 01:18:04,145
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to do their roles.

830
01:18:05,486 --> 01:18:08,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was really into this game coming out.

831
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:09,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone was on it.

832
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:18,193
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, LucasArts was also in production on a full throttle Avenger game sequel called Hell on Wheels.

833
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:24,458
[SPEAKER_04]: and they halted production on that but they still said Freelance Police was going to happen on time.

834
01:18:26,059 --> 01:18:35,227
[SPEAKER_04]: There were interviews, there were all kinds of stuff going on and then they, as their general manager, Mike Nelson, I will read this verbatim,

835
01:18:35,948 --> 01:18:49,397
[SPEAKER_04]: After careful evaluation of current marketplace realities and underlying economic considerations, we've decided that this was not the time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC.

836
01:18:50,177 --> 01:18:53,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And people didn't like it, including Steve Purcell.

837
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:58,643
[SPEAKER_04]: He was saying the game was coming along great.

838
01:18:58,723 --> 01:18:59,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on schedule.

839
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: He was pleased with the writing quality, the gameplay, the animation, the 3D world.

840
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:09,010
[SPEAKER_04]: He was really happy with it.

841
01:19:09,831 --> 01:19:19,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And said that it was a shame to think their accomplishments as well as the goodwill that has been growing in the gaming press toward this project will all go to waste due to this short-sighted decision.

842
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:20,738
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he said.

843
01:19:22,662 --> 01:19:39,736
[SPEAKER_04]: and the voice actors were never told about the game's cancellation they found out when they looked it up online and very disappointed again so with the formation of Telltale that's when

844
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:50,380
[SPEAKER_04]: The Freelance Police mini cases were turned into an episodic series of the games.

845
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:56,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of the work from Freelance Police was carried over since LucasArts still held onto the game's assets.

846
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:04,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So they turned what they could and they got Sam & Max Save the World in October 2006.

847
01:20:06,913 --> 01:20:33,673
[SPEAKER_04]: um but part of the plot summary was used in Poker Night 2 talking about an off-screen adventure that they had during the course of the game and um it was uh one of it was the thing that they were going to do with the giant penguins in the land of Subarctica which was renamed Zizobia in Poker Night 2 where Max was worshipped as a god um and then um

848
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:44,312
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the plots in the game is that Sam and Max are going to switch each other's brains and the voice actors are going to do impressions of each other's characters.

849
01:20:44,432 --> 01:20:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been hilarious.

850
01:20:47,194 --> 01:20:53,177
[SPEAKER_04]: But at any rate, we've got some holdovers, but the game itself is lost to us.

851
01:20:54,118 --> 01:21:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one day someone will find a disc sitting in a LucasArts dumpster and we'll have it.

852
01:21:04,746 --> 01:21:05,286
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

853
01:21:05,466 --> 01:21:08,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes that's how those cancelled games show up eventually, right?

854
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:08,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

855
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:09,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there it is.

856
01:21:10,368 --> 01:21:10,988
[SPEAKER_04]: R.I.P.

857
01:21:12,308 --> 01:21:15,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Salmon Axe Freelance Police.

858
01:21:15,449 --> 01:21:17,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Your classic game of the week.

859
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:19,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Classic cancelled game.

860
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:20,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Classic cancelled game of the week.

861
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:21,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

862
01:21:22,371 --> 01:21:23,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby says it's in the Disney vault now.

863
01:21:25,592 --> 01:21:28,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Petition Disney, bring back Salmon Axe Freelance Police.

864
01:21:29,554 --> 01:21:36,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's travel around and check out some other headlines rather rapidly in what we call Rapid Fire News.

865
01:21:37,637 --> 01:21:40,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go over to Loki to start us off.

866
01:21:41,378 --> 01:21:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently Final Fantasy XIV is now partnering with Logos, an outdoor camping company.

867
01:21:53,358 --> 01:21:59,623
[SPEAKER_02]: to provide some camping gear with Final Fantasy 14 stuff on it.

868
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:00,944
[SPEAKER_02]: To which I say, 14?

869
01:22:03,325 --> 01:22:04,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not 15?

870
01:22:04,867 --> 01:22:07,349
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you did in 15 was camp around.

871
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, missed opportunity there.

872
01:22:11,732 --> 01:22:14,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess, you know, 14 is better than nothing.

873
01:22:15,675 --> 01:22:21,139
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested, that stuff goes on pre-order here Friday, November 15th.

874
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:25,267
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can get all sorts of things.

875
01:22:25,427 --> 01:22:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That tent looks very small.

876
01:22:28,108 --> 01:22:28,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever.

877
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:32,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the comment it's a missed opportunity for $15.

878
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:36,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It is absolutely a missed opportunity for $15.

879
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:39,732
[SPEAKER_02]: However, their products are expensive.

880
01:22:39,992 --> 01:22:40,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep that in mind.

881
01:22:41,653 --> 01:22:42,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Their tents are from $100 to $3,000.

882
01:22:42,953 --> 01:22:43,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

883
01:22:43,073 --> 01:22:43,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

884
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:43,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

885
01:22:52,014 --> 01:23:17,909
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and then uh one other thing I was also gonna uh bring up as well not only that but Final Fantasy 14 is also teamed up with and I cannot pronounce this brand of I'm gonna try anyways it's Schwarzkopf I guess uh it's a uh hair dye for um yeah I've used their their hair dye before yeah it's a hair dye company so they're also teaming up with them you can get all your

01:23:18,444 --> 01:23:34,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV character hair colors now in for like cosplay and stuff like actually, yeah, I get it yeah it's interesting you go camping and cosplay, there you go camping and cosplay, a perfect combination

887
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:38,308
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4

888
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:25,921
[SPEAKER_02]: so those are going to be your new games that are available from November 5th through December 2nd and part of the PlayStation Plus Essential Subscriber lineup because they have tears now like the tears coming out of my eyes for how disappointed I am in them that's it moving over to DarkSakura

889
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,161
[SPEAKER_04]: There is going to be a musical for Castlevania.

890
01:24:32,863 --> 01:24:41,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've already done the Great Ace Attorney series, so there was that.

891
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:45,334
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is going to be called a musical romance.

892
01:24:46,455 --> 01:25:06,511
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's going to be running from June 7th to July 20th 2025 at the Takarazuka Grand Theater and then August 16th to September 28th 2025 at Tokyo Takarazuka Theater with tickets to go on sale May 17th 2025 and then July 13th 2025 for the other showing it

893
01:25:14,878 --> 01:25:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be performed by the Flower Troupe that's led by C. Nakatsuki with script and direction being written by Kei Suzuki.

894
01:25:25,622 --> 01:25:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Also was the one who worked on the musicals for Ace Attorney and Sengoku Basara.

895
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:33,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So, cool.

896
01:25:36,474 --> 01:25:39,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm very curious to see what turns out with that.

897
01:25:40,056 --> 01:25:41,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything to not put out a new game.

898
01:25:43,117 --> 01:25:45,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Meaning a new new game, not a rehashing of the old games.

899
01:25:45,898 --> 01:25:48,620
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't Konami, it's just another troop licensing it.

900
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:52,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but it's still within the Konami universe and the use of their IP.

901
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:55,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just frustrated that we haven't had a new Castlevania game in I don't know how long.

902
01:25:56,471 --> 01:26:03,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, well, you know, speaking of rehashing all the old hits again, we just were talking about Toaplan last week.

903
01:26:03,276 --> 01:26:03,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what?

904
01:26:04,217 --> 01:26:10,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about it again tonight because we have another Toaplan game that's coming out.

905
01:26:10,722 --> 01:26:16,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a set of shoot-em-up games, of course, getting reissued by RetroBit.

906
01:26:17,087 --> 01:26:20,870
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the Toaplan Genesis and Mega Drive collection.

907
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:23,392
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Toaplan Shooters Collection Volume 2 collection.

908
01:26:23,952 --> 01:26:42,851
[SPEAKER_09]: and it is going to include Twin Cobra, Grindstormer and Slap Fight MD uh which of course were for the Genesis and Mega Drive so that's pretty cool and also the first time Slap Fight MD was released in North America the other two were um already done so you know that's that's that um

909
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:45,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently that is the original Japanese.

910
01:26:46,454 --> 01:26:49,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not some localization funny thing.

911
01:26:49,956 --> 01:26:54,599
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's apparently has a remake and remix mode in it.

912
01:26:54,839 --> 01:26:58,741
[SPEAKER_09]: And Yuzo Koshiro is actually a part of the score, which is kind of cool.

913
01:26:58,921 --> 01:26:59,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

914
01:26:59,602 --> 01:26:59,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

915
01:27:00,002 --> 01:27:01,203
[SPEAKER_09]: So very cool.

916
01:27:02,543 --> 01:27:03,164
[SPEAKER_09]: You can check that out.

917
01:27:03,804 --> 01:27:04,024
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

918
01:27:04,044 --> 01:27:12,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you want to see a game that's coming out real soon for you nearby, check out the world release dates of games in your region.

919
01:27:12,129 --> 01:27:13,250
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start with the U.S., Loki.

920
01:27:14,302 --> 01:27:16,984
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Tinkertown on Nintendo Switch.

921
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That game that I just said was going to be free.

922
01:27:20,366 --> 01:27:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, free.

923
01:27:21,347 --> 01:27:21,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Free.

924
01:27:22,548 --> 01:27:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: With PlayStation Plus.

[SPEAKER_09]: That same Slitterhead game that Loki was talking about also out in Japan.

987
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we have anything, but we'll check.

988
01:32:54,695 --> 01:33:10,080
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we do have a couple things to read off our Blue Sky feed because now that's a thing which by the way I forgot to mention earlier in the show but our Blue Sky handle did get updated to be verified by our domain so Jason pulled a miracle as he usually does and helped us get the orangelaunchradio.com

989
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,160
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just different.

990
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:11,420
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better.

991
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:11,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's better.

992
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:12,380
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyway.

993
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it is missing a couple things, but at least you're not supporting you-know-who.

994
01:33:15,161 --> 01:33:16,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's get to those news stories.

995
01:33:16,921 --> 01:33:17,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

996
01:33:34,144 --> 01:33:38,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's some more news coming about the Playdate.

997
01:33:39,309 --> 01:33:40,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's pretty exciting.

998
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:46,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Playdate launched, was it back in 2019, I believe.

999
01:33:47,536 --> 01:33:54,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually, may have been delayed a little bit, but I know that Season 1 was included with the Playdate.

1000
01:33:54,582 --> 01:33:57,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So what it was is that you got like, I think it was like 24 games, 20 games played.

1001
01:34:00,727 --> 01:34:09,373
[SPEAKER_02]: that were essentially unlocked once a week on the playdate as time went on and it was kind of included with the price of the system and it was really cool.

1002
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:16,999
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of really good games from a lot of independent game developers and now they're kind of doing that all over again.

1003
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:24,804
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced that Season 2 is actually going to be coming early next year and we don't know necessarily what's going to be in that.

1004
01:34:25,104 --> 01:34:26,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to be included for free?

1005
01:34:27,066 --> 01:34:28,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be something that we pay for?

1006
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:29,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's still worth paying for because it's

1007
01:34:30,368 --> 01:34:55,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really awesome the games that you got in it but there's also another feature that they haven't talked about yet that they're also going to be revealing as part of that and then along with that they're going to be doing a kind of a sale on the catalog which is basically the games that are out right now their storefront so there's gonna be a sale going on between I believe now and the 14th um

1008
01:34:58,849 --> 01:34:59,469
[SPEAKER_02]: of this month.

1009
01:34:59,589 --> 01:35:05,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're definitely using the playdate or want to pick one up, I'd say now's a good time to do that.

1010
01:35:06,673 --> 01:35:08,014
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good games on there.

1011
01:35:08,034 --> 01:35:11,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep buying stuff for it and my kids keep playing it.

1012
01:35:11,096 --> 01:35:18,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been playing it as much, but it does get gameplay at least once a week.

1013
01:35:21,363 --> 01:35:22,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I still want to get one.

1014
01:35:22,405 --> 01:35:26,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a cool train sim game that's all 3D and stuff.

1015
01:35:26,414 --> 01:35:27,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

1016
01:35:28,038 --> 01:35:31,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing the stuff that you can pull off on those systems.

1017
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the crank like power the train?

1018
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:34,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's kind of fun.

1019
01:35:34,952 --> 01:35:36,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

1020
01:35:37,214 --> 01:35:46,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It does like the it's for the speed control because you know the speed control on trains is kind of like a vertical crank and so yeah it's using that to brake.

1021
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:51,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't because once again it's a train sim game and I don't know how to play those at all.

1022
01:35:52,786 --> 01:36:00,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very lost but you have to like speed up and then brake so you don't get too late and you want to slow down for the stations and stuff and

1023
01:36:01,593 --> 01:36:08,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure somebody that plays Train Sims would actually understand how to play that game, but it's really cool looking for that little device.

1024
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:18,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well we have one more story for you guys, and it has to do with, oh, I'm sure Ubisoft is setting themselves up for success with this one.

1025
01:36:18,962 --> 01:36:25,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, they have actually released their first ever blockchain game, which involves NFTs.

1026
01:36:25,724 --> 01:36:34,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Ubisoft had announced this game last June, after talking about, basically threatening that for some time they were going to get into the blockchain, but now they have launched this game quietly.

1027
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:40,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It is available on the PC, and it is free to start, so it's free to play, but of course you can purchase...

1028
01:36:40,569 --> 01:36:44,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why something is being sold for that much, but there are some things where I prefer to be ignorant.

1029
01:36:44,091 --> 01:36:44,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1030
01:37:02,145 --> 01:37:03,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't.

1031
01:37:03,626 --> 01:37:04,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just do.

1032
01:37:04,467 --> 01:37:04,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

1033
01:37:05,008 --> 01:37:06,389
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an idiot if you buy it.

1034
01:37:06,549 --> 01:37:07,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry.

1035
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:13,636
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also play this game without the figurines, but I'm sure it will be much better for you if you do buy the figurines.

1036
01:37:14,777 --> 01:37:15,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1037
01:37:16,098 --> 01:37:19,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, there's nothing about this game that looks like it's unique or what have you.

1038
01:37:20,342 --> 01:37:25,907
[SPEAKER_09]: The studio director at Ubisoft Paris in an interview with IGN said the game offers deep strategic gameplay.

1039
01:37:26,427 --> 01:37:26,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure does.

1040
01:37:26,747 --> 01:37:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure does.

1041
01:37:49,453 --> 01:38:02,459
[SPEAKER_02]: it because it is cryptocurrency involved I had no idea that that would be we're going to have some crime some actual detective work and then full penetration and then more detective work and then more full penetration

1042
01:38:03,559 --> 01:38:03,940
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that.

1043
01:38:05,281 --> 01:38:10,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Just throwing it out there, there was an NFT platform launched by Ubisoft previously called Quartz.

1044
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:18,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon was the first game on it, and it only sold 15 NFTs, according to early reports.

1045
01:38:18,612 --> 01:38:21,835
[SPEAKER_09]: But Ubisoft was saying the players just don't get it.

1046
01:38:22,715 --> 01:38:24,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't get it.

1047
01:38:24,317 --> 01:38:26,318
[SPEAKER_09]: All we have to sell is one of those $64,000 things, and we've made big.

1048
01:38:26,338 --> 01:38:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1049
01:38:31,903 --> 01:38:32,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1050
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:01,782
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1051
01:39:03,543 --> 01:39:05,603
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're willing to talk to you all for free.

1052
01:39:05,623 --> 01:39:09,445
[SPEAKER_02]: They have against the company about, you know, sexual conduct and harassment and stuff like that.

1053
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:12,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's another thing they could do.

1054
01:39:12,966 --> 01:39:15,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Just this is yet another thing out of Ubisoft that's going to flop.

1055
01:39:17,267 --> 01:39:22,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, you know, unfortunately, the wrong people will be let go for it.

1056
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:30,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a game development studio had to make that, unfortunately.

1057
01:39:32,779 --> 01:39:36,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go around and get some listener comments.

1058
01:39:37,523 --> 01:39:42,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week we invite your comments over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com via the mailbag.

1059
01:39:42,808 --> 01:39:44,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure we got any, but I'll check.

1060
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:45,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1061
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:49,831
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some spam in here, but I already fried it up and had it on the Subie.

1062
01:40:11,597 --> 01:40:17,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Since these seem to be the two big games that social media was talking about, we did get a response from WayneN12 who said, Get it!

1063
01:40:17,543 --> 01:40:20,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you've got DarkSakura's opinion for sure.

1064
01:40:20,586 --> 01:40:21,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I will jump in this week.

1065
01:40:21,747 --> 01:40:24,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to get my retro stuff all done in advance tonight.

1066
01:40:32,338 --> 01:40:32,919
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1067
01:40:55,257 --> 01:41:24,013
[SPEAKER_09]: um but yes I I'm gonna check that out very soon I'm excited to get in on that so uh but you can send us uh stuff as well if you'd like to via blue sky uh you can also uh give us a shout out in chat if you have any questions or anything you want to talk about twitch.tv slash VOG network uh dark to see you talking about I'm busy finishing my replay of Chrono Trigger and the Castlevania Dominus stuff plus the rest of CV Chronicles yeah that's one of those rainy day games I'd love to get to I need to take two weeks of awful work like Loki so I can catch up on gaming

1068
01:41:24,835 --> 01:41:30,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Except, I kind of, I mean, I have a lot of time off available.

1069
01:41:30,381 --> 01:41:33,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I really can't justify taking two weeks off of work to stay at home and play video games.

1070
01:41:34,325 --> 01:41:37,969
[SPEAKER_09]: A week to go on a cruise, four days to go to Nashville, yes.

1071
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:42,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay home and play video games, maybe one or two days, but not two weeks.

1072
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,001
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1073
01:42:12,029 --> 01:42:15,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I think also they took time off when Zelda Tears of the Kingdom came out.

1074
01:42:16,853 --> 01:42:19,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm like, you know what?

1075
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:21,557
[SPEAKER_09]: That is absolutely a legitimate reason.

1076
01:42:21,597 --> 01:42:22,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally fair.

1077
01:42:22,498 --> 01:42:29,304
[SPEAKER_09]: This individual works hard, and if this is how they get their brain break, totally fair.

1078
01:42:29,984 --> 01:42:30,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I support it.

1079
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:31,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do.

1080
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:33,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Vacay time is your time.

1081
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:34,008
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1082
01:42:34,108 --> 01:42:35,769
[SPEAKER_04]: No one needs to know what you take it off for.

1083
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:36,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also...

1084
01:42:37,847 --> 01:42:38,148
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1085
01:42:48,636 --> 01:42:49,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Period dot.

1086
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:51,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that true in every state?

1087
01:42:51,318 --> 01:42:52,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm legit questioning.

1088
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it is.

1089
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's federal level.

1090
01:42:55,341 --> 01:42:57,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1091
01:42:57,742 --> 01:42:58,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to chat.

1092
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,385
[SPEAKER_09]: The Breakman says, two weeks off to play video games?

1093
01:43:01,485 --> 01:43:02,205
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do that?

1094
01:43:02,345 --> 01:43:11,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, as part of the terms of employment, you get to negotiate compensation that usually includes time off, vacation, that sort of thing.

1095
01:43:12,372 --> 01:43:17,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And as DarkSakura kind of referenced, when you want to take vacation, you don't have to tell them why.

1096
01:43:18,896 --> 01:43:29,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people I've ever interacted with in my life, if you're like, I just need two days for like a mental wellness break, I've known very few people in my past that would say, no, you can't have it.

1097
01:43:30,284 --> 01:43:34,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Like people support that kind of stuff and you want to avoid burnout type of thing.

1098
01:43:35,227 --> 01:43:41,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And if a mental wellness break for you is I'm going to slay demons in Diablo for 72 hours straight, then more power to you.

1099
01:43:41,771 --> 01:43:42,532
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nobody's business.

1100
01:43:43,012 --> 01:43:43,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I've ever done that.

1101
01:43:43,712 --> 01:43:45,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taken two days off to do nothing but sleep.

1102
01:43:45,493 --> 01:43:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1103
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:47,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious.

1104
01:43:48,076 --> 01:43:48,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a condition.

1105
01:43:48,996 --> 01:43:49,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I get it.

1106
01:43:50,918 --> 01:43:54,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I took a day off, I think, for one of the Final Fantasy XIV expansions, I want to say.

1107
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a while ago.

1108
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:57,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a new recent one.

1109
01:43:57,802 --> 01:44:00,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember skipping school for a week to play Final Fantasy 3, 6.

1110
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:06,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember being sick from school to play Final Fantasy 3.

1111
01:44:06,728 --> 01:44:07,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I do remember that.

1112
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:09,190
[SPEAKER_09]: That was some time ago.

1113
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:11,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at chat for some other comments on this.

1114
01:44:12,332 --> 01:44:12,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1115
01:44:13,813 --> 01:44:17,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, S2100Matt responding to the original bleat says the correct answer is both.

1116
01:44:18,378 --> 01:44:20,800
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have the trading card game battle on auto.

1117
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:21,561
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.

1118
01:44:21,601 --> 01:44:22,922
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one thing I really like about it.

1119
01:44:23,003 --> 01:44:25,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I'm learning, I did win a battle by myself.

1120
01:44:25,465 --> 01:44:26,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you just have the computer do it.

1121
01:44:26,986 --> 01:44:29,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to build the decks and let them do it and hope it wins.

1122
01:44:29,509 --> 01:44:30,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, there's that.

1123
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:33,913
[SPEAKER_09]: The Breakman says I've taken a day off for a game, but weeks.

1124
01:44:34,134 --> 01:44:35,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's up to you.

1125
01:44:35,595 --> 01:44:36,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause here's the thing.

1126
01:44:36,956 --> 01:44:37,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

1127
01:44:38,649 --> 01:44:39,529
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1128
01:44:56,318 --> 01:44:58,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're Loki, then yes, you play Minecraft.

1129
01:44:58,559 --> 01:45:00,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I am taking two weeks off for that.

1130
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:01,281
[SPEAKER_09]: All fucking day.

1131
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:03,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It's productive stuff.

1132
01:45:03,342 --> 01:45:05,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to design things and film things.

1133
01:45:05,563 --> 01:45:07,484
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your hobby, right?

1134
01:45:09,565 --> 01:45:15,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody I work with knows that nerd conventions are my hobby.

1135
01:45:16,689 --> 01:45:19,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very fortunate that people are full-on supportive.

1136
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:22,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you want to go to DragonCon and host these panels and stuff?

1137
01:45:22,853 --> 01:45:23,573
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1138
01:45:23,673 --> 01:45:24,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Go do it.

1139
01:45:25,234 --> 01:45:40,278
[SPEAKER_09]: as long as the work is getting done that's the most important part as long as there's coverage it's awesome it's also the punishment for making me come into the office for three days which was an absolute cannot be understated waste of time I forgot that was a thing you had to do

1140
01:45:42,438 --> 01:45:44,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there was no point to any of it.

1141
01:45:45,019 --> 01:45:47,059
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was so essential that I was there.

1142
01:45:47,659 --> 01:45:48,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely essential.

1143
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to listen to all the people screw around while I had stuff that I actually had to do.

1144
01:45:53,361 --> 01:45:59,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And meetings that I didn't need to be in because I'd been at that company for so long that it's just immersion stuff.

1145
01:45:59,402 --> 01:46:02,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, here's what other people on your team do.

1146
01:46:02,483 --> 01:46:03,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I know what you guys do.

1147
01:46:04,003 --> 01:46:05,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here that long.

1148
01:46:05,044 --> 01:46:05,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you...

1149
01:46:06,906 --> 01:46:08,947
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1150
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:32,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1151
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:35,653
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, I think it just depends.

1152
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:41,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like to talk a lot about my day job on air for obvious reasons, and I know I have coworkers that listen.

1153
01:46:41,317 --> 01:46:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you know who you are.

1154
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:55,148
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing with all that is that I went into the office because I had to be – I don't want to give away too much, but there was a thing that I needed to be there for an hour because it was the type of thing you can only do in person.

1155
01:46:55,168 --> 01:46:55,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to leave it at that.

1156
01:46:56,309 --> 01:47:01,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to go into the office, but I actually – I was like, because I could have a whole office to myself –

1157
01:47:01,733 --> 01:47:04,474
[SPEAKER_09]: The cats weren't screaming at me all day to distract me.

1158
01:47:04,814 --> 01:47:06,935
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of forcing myself out of my normal environment.

1159
01:47:06,995 --> 01:47:08,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually felt like I had a super productive day.

1160
01:47:10,435 --> 01:47:15,177
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, different than Loki's experience because not everybody was there.

1161
01:47:15,217 --> 01:47:17,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just the group I was doing a certain thing with.

1162
01:47:17,778 --> 01:47:20,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, this was nice to have a little break.

1163
01:47:20,738 --> 01:47:22,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to do it in part.

1164
01:47:23,099 --> 01:47:24,059
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big difference too.

1165
01:47:24,519 --> 01:47:26,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I like going to work because the cafeteria.

1166
01:47:27,921 --> 01:47:31,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we don't have any of that anymore either because that's all been shut down.

1167
01:47:31,264 --> 01:47:38,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, on top of that, like, it was you know, it was funny because it was very quiet and very loud at the same time.

1168
01:47:38,832 --> 01:47:42,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, I got there, I'm working on my stuff because I'm not going into any of these meetings.

1169
01:47:42,876 --> 01:47:43,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm essentially just coming in

1170
01:47:44,679 --> 01:47:46,240
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1171
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Then another co-worker of mine actually comes in a few days later.

1172
01:48:05,731 --> 01:48:08,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't they keep those personal phone calls to the bathroom like everybody else?

1173
01:48:09,052 --> 01:48:11,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just like go take them somewhere else.

1174
01:48:11,093 --> 01:48:14,254
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, I guess you're just used to the office being pretty empty.

1175
01:48:14,314 --> 01:48:15,695
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just, whatever.

1176
01:48:16,655 --> 01:48:21,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some other co-workers come in and just goof off for four hours.

1177
01:48:21,937 --> 01:48:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you think the idea is that you come into the office to be more productive, that ain't happening.

1178
01:48:27,539 --> 01:48:31,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just them gossiping and flirting for four hours.

1179
01:48:32,851 --> 01:48:34,312
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1180
01:49:01,616 --> 01:49:02,636
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a song.

1181
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:09,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the name of the song, but part of the chorus starts off and says, I've had better days.

1182
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:12,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been my motto for the last two months.

1183
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to hear it, but I hope at least today was a good one.

1184
01:49:16,401 --> 01:49:17,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for sharing part of your day with us.

1185
01:49:21,163 --> 01:49:21,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Better.

1186
01:49:21,823 --> 01:49:26,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you have a weird noise gate because you went silent for five seconds and it all came in at once.

1187
01:49:26,365 --> 01:49:26,765
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1188
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:28,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I apologize.

1189
01:49:28,511 --> 01:49:31,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the brand new studio and evidently I've been reaped.

1190
01:49:33,154 --> 01:49:36,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been recalibrating the microphone to save my own arse.

1191
01:49:36,616 --> 01:49:37,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize.

1192
01:49:37,776 --> 01:49:38,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you.

1193
01:49:38,116 --> 01:49:42,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Check the noise gate because that's the thing I think that's giving you a little problem, but you're fine now.

1194
01:49:42,759 --> 01:49:43,860
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, my friend?

1195
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:54,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to power up with the whole life balance and work and cons and hobbies.

1196
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:56,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a story.

1197
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:57,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1198
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

1199
01:49:59,381 --> 01:50:06,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know how in most places, the main rule is if you want time off, you have to put in two weeks in advance.

1200
01:50:08,523 --> 01:50:09,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Places, three.

1201
01:50:10,043 --> 01:50:10,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1202
01:50:11,183 --> 01:50:12,644
[SPEAKER_00]: At my job, we have two systems.

1203
01:50:12,984 --> 01:50:15,984
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the HR system, and we have a ticketing system.

1204
01:50:16,304 --> 01:50:23,606
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put it through the ticketing system, it sends everybody into the department like a calendar event to let people know you're going to be out of the office that day.

1205
01:50:24,773 --> 01:50:37,437
[SPEAKER_00]: That's convenient, that's convenient So I do that whenever I I'm like, oh, I'm going to be at a con And I do this Last year, a co-worker walks up to me like Oh, can you cover my shift on Friday?

1206
01:50:37,457 --> 01:50:41,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no What do you mean you're not going to be here?

1207
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:43,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Friday off Where are you going?

1208
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:51,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to a con Oh, I know where this is going Sorry, I know the punchline here And it's going to piss me off, but go ahead

1209
01:50:55,117 --> 01:50:56,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we trade off?

1210
01:50:56,698 --> 01:50:57,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Friday's my birthday.

1211
01:50:57,778 --> 01:50:59,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, sorry, dude, can't help you.

1212
01:51:00,219 --> 01:51:00,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the time.

1213
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I already put the time in, you know?

1214
01:51:03,761 --> 01:51:05,842
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that said and done.

1215
01:51:06,722 --> 01:51:16,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And this co-worker tends to just let people know at the very last minute they're taking time off.

1216
01:51:16,527 --> 01:51:19,008
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happened in September.

1217
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:22,271
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of that.

1218
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:27,352
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured, okay, my boss knows I'm looking for a place.

1219
01:51:27,412 --> 01:51:28,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a place.

1220
01:51:29,652 --> 01:51:30,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll speak to him on Monday.

1221
01:51:32,453 --> 01:51:34,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send him an email on Monday or talk to him on Tuesday.

1222
01:51:34,814 --> 01:51:36,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell him the reason.

1223
01:51:36,974 --> 01:51:46,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is last minute, but I need to leave work early this whole week so I can finish packing stuff up and put it in my new place or in storage.

1224
01:51:46,917 --> 01:51:47,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.

1225
01:51:49,602 --> 01:51:52,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Tuesday morning, black notification.

1226
01:51:54,703 --> 01:51:55,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Coworker says we need to talk.

1227
01:51:56,324 --> 01:51:57,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what's up?

1228
01:51:58,384 --> 01:52:02,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I'm not coming in today.

1229
01:52:04,086 --> 01:52:05,946
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean you're not coming in today?

1230
01:52:07,187 --> 01:52:09,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you forget I'm getting married this weekend?

1231
01:52:10,027 --> 01:52:11,868
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't forget.

1232
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:14,868
[SPEAKER_00]: But why are you not coming in today?

1233
01:52:15,589 --> 01:52:16,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I gotta take care of last night.

1234
01:52:18,604 --> 01:52:37,943
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just staring at my screen and if you can picture a volcano on my head just exploding, you know, and I'm just like I'm glad I have anger management techniques from therapy.

1235
01:52:38,163 --> 01:52:39,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You've learned to breathe.

1236
01:52:39,344 --> 01:52:39,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
01:52:41,773 --> 01:52:42,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1238
01:52:58,972 --> 01:53:24,175
[SPEAKER_09]: like grow up and don't go like because I've I've had that in the past not at my current employer but in the past I not so direct but like me reading between the lines was very much like oh I can feel this judgment coming down and back the f up this is my life not yours type of thing you know you know do you know how much notice we have to give at my job a month one hour huh

1239
01:53:25,339 --> 01:53:29,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it really depends on where you're at because coverage, etc, etc.

1240
01:53:30,342 --> 01:53:32,083
[SPEAKER_09]: But still, that's why you have to take a little planning.

1241
01:53:32,203 --> 01:53:45,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So your co-worker probably should have thought, oh, it's possible that if I'm getting married on Saturday, I'm going to need Thursday and Friday at the minimum to take care of things that are going to come up last minute for my fucking wedding.

1242
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:53,054
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little wild that they didn't have enough foresight to ask for a little extra time off around the weekend.

1243
01:53:54,910 --> 01:54:01,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have understood completely if he said it in advance because I could have altered means and so forth.

1244
01:54:01,897 --> 01:54:03,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still able to do so.

1245
01:54:04,019 --> 01:54:08,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what really got under my skin was at the time, there's only two people in the department.

1246
01:54:08,844 --> 01:54:17,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have remote techs and this and that, but it's, I'll tell you this, when the office discovers there's only one tech,

1247
01:54:19,435 --> 01:54:20,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Slack explodes.

1248
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:23,237
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a line of people at my desk.

1249
01:54:23,337 --> 01:54:28,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to put a sign up that says, send an email for support.

1250
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:31,220
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm like, I'm doing everything that I can.

1251
01:54:31,461 --> 01:54:33,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's five people in the office.

1252
01:54:33,401 --> 01:54:36,683
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say jump, I go how high to make sure everything is.

1253
01:54:39,059 --> 01:54:47,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess the lesson learned here is there's no issue with taking work off to play video games, but just plan a little bit.

1254
01:54:47,868 --> 01:54:53,233
[SPEAKER_09]: For most employers, you're going to have to give a little bit of notice at least that you plan to do that so that coverage can be worked out and all that good stuff.

1255
01:54:53,293 --> 01:55:00,060
[SPEAKER_09]: But playing games is mental health for a lot of people or attending conventions or whatever your nerddom is.

1256
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:00,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerddom.

1257
01:55:01,837 --> 01:55:02,779
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1258
01:55:14,344 --> 01:55:21,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt happy going because it's like I'm going to see my New England cosplay convention squad.

1259
01:55:21,972 --> 01:55:23,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do photography.

1260
01:55:23,273 --> 01:55:24,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hang out with some peeps.

1261
01:55:24,975 --> 01:55:26,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make some friends.

1262
01:55:26,276 --> 01:55:27,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a drink.

1263
01:55:28,178 --> 01:55:32,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually reconnected with somebody I had a falling out with and we both matured over that.

1264
01:55:32,963 --> 01:55:35,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, what more can you ask for?

1265
01:55:35,325 --> 01:55:36,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:55:38,632 --> 01:55:42,193
[SPEAKER_00]: The last con I went to this past weekend, yeah, there were some things that happened.

1267
01:55:42,213 --> 01:55:44,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you offline.

1268
01:55:44,513 --> 01:55:47,274
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it still was a great time.

1269
01:55:47,314 --> 01:55:53,015
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend of mine did this panel on anime and the psychology behind it.

1270
01:55:53,095 --> 01:55:55,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hit me personally.

1271
01:55:55,375 --> 01:55:56,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spoke to him.

1272
01:55:56,196 --> 01:55:58,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this really hit close to home.

1273
01:55:58,736 --> 01:55:59,396
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm sorry.

1274
01:55:59,416 --> 01:56:00,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, don't apologize.

1275
01:56:01,097 --> 01:56:01,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel for it.

1276
01:56:01,817 --> 01:56:02,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.

1277
01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:04,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've really connected with me.

1278
01:56:04,917 --> 01:56:06,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate that.

1279
01:56:09,669 --> 01:56:18,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Monday, Thursday, day zero, let's go, let's do this, you know.

1280
01:56:19,256 --> 01:56:21,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's a three-day con, Thursday.

1281
01:56:21,838 --> 01:56:24,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday, let's go, we're going to do it, we're going to have a good time, you know.

1282
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:32,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, yes, there is that PCD, post-con depression that happens.

1283
01:56:33,126 --> 01:56:35,728
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're just full of like this...

1284
01:56:36,716 --> 01:56:42,501
[SPEAKER_00]: natural high just being there and just having a good time you're running around

1285
01:56:44,088 --> 01:56:53,517
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 Days, and Fancy Fabrics being a complete and total dork and everybody's giving you hugs and high fives and like, here, drink!

1286
01:56:54,437 --> 01:57:00,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a type of expression that most of us have to suppress from 9 to 5 type of thing.

1287
01:57:00,343 --> 01:57:01,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a lot of what it is.

1288
01:57:01,985 --> 01:57:07,470
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to be your authentic self for a weekend and then you have to put on your work drag and go to work.

1289
01:57:08,593 --> 01:57:14,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're in IT, because there's a lot of anime and nerd merch floating around.

1290
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did go to work on Halloween as Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, so you know.

1291
01:57:22,807 --> 01:57:29,333
[SPEAKER_04]: They were doing dress-up, but I had the day off for a procedure.

1292
01:57:30,339 --> 01:57:57,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I rarely have costumes anymore because I'm usually hosting on the weekend and more like eccentric host type of garb so that's usually all I end up having for Halloween so I guess I could go as Rod Roddy every year which is valid Rod Roddy's awesome, come on now Let's hear it though for having cosplay on hand because I easily converted my pig cosmetic into the actual Amanda from Saw outfit for the thing at Coin Op

1293
01:57:59,548 --> 01:58:25,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I did one year I had gone to Rocky Horror as sexy pizza where I had one of those like cardboard pizza cutouts and then I was wearing like fishnets heels and like fishnet gloves and stuff because the joke was everything sexy on Halloween everybody dresses like a slut on Halloween so I went as sexy pizza and I actually I did reuse just the pizza part at work but with like you know a t-shirt and jeans and I was just like look I'm pizza but

1294
01:58:28,902 --> 01:58:30,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's your sausage, right?

1295
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:32,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Ayo.

1296
01:58:32,324 --> 01:58:32,764
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1297
01:58:33,205 --> 01:58:35,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?

1298
01:58:36,226 --> 01:58:38,188
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's it, my friends.

1299
01:58:38,228 --> 01:58:39,188
[SPEAKER_09]: What a note to end on.

1300
01:58:39,528 --> 01:58:43,010

01:58:58,289 --> 01:59:01,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so- well, actually, wait, I should get last-minute stories from Loki, sorry.

1311
01:59:01,673 --> 01:59:03,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there are any, but it's worth checking out.

1312
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:05,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no last-minute stories.

1313
01:59:07,335 --> 01:59:09,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have no last minute stories.

1314
01:59:23,827 --> 01:59:27,210
[SPEAKER_09]: They go an awful long way, so thank you so much for all of that support.

1315
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:31,833
[SPEAKER_09]: We all appreciate the follows and support on our personal channels as well.

1316
01:59:32,213 --> 01:59:34,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Loki is a YouTuber at LokiOLR.

1317
01:59:35,155 --> 01:59:38,137
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is a Twitch streamer here at DarkSakuraTTV.

1318
01:59:38,818 --> 01:59:44,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a little bit of both, but I will give you my YouTube for now, which is Rob Roberts Plays.

1319
01:59:45,783 --> 01:59:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

1320
01:59:47,924 --> 01:59:51,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of DarkSakura on Twitch, I believe you're going to be... What are you playing tonight?

1321
01:59:51,567 --> 01:59:53,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to play Dragon Age or are you going to play Debbie?

1322
01:59:53,328 --> 01:59:54,589
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm playing Dead by Daylight.

1323
01:59:54,849 --> 01:59:57,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I specifically got asked, are you playing Dead by Daylight tonight?

1324
01:59:57,791 --> 02:00:00,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yes, because I'm going to play with my friend Smokey.

1325
02:00:00,233 --> 02:00:00,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fun.

1326
02:00:00,713 --> 02:00:01,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yum.

1329
02:00:05,357 --> 02:00:06,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Any last words for our listeners tonight?

1330
02:00:07,718 --> 02:00:12,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, um, um, no.

1331

[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go over to Loki.

1339
02:00:17,725 --> 02:00:18,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Your final thought tonight.

1340
02:00:19,415 --> 02:00:24,141
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is there should be a new episode of my Minecraft series out tomorrow.

1341
02:00:24,501 --> 02:00:25,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of building.

1342
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:31,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two Redstone Carnival minigames that are functional.

1343
02:00:31,169 --> 02:00:34,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a merry-go-round that someone made for me that I...

1344
02:00:36,189 --> 02:00:38,492
[SPEAKER_02]: fixed and changed the redstone on a bit.

1345
02:00:39,534 --> 02:00:40,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also 100% functional.

1346
02:00:41,196 --> 02:00:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another roller coaster.

1347
02:00:42,558 --> 02:00:44,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another functional ride.

1348
02:00:45,202 --> 02:00:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff.

1349
02:00:47,165 --> 02:00:48,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I love all these theme park things you're doing.

1350
02:00:48,887 --> 02:00:49,308
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

1351
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:51,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1352
02:00:52,131 --> 02:00:52,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow.

1353
02:00:52,712 --> 02:00:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, cool.

1354
02:00:54,493 --> 02:00:59,598
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is now that Halloween is over, you know what?

1355
02:00:59,638 --> 02:01:01,280
[SPEAKER_09]: We can keep Mariah on ice.

1356
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It is too early to celebrate Christmas.

1357
02:01:04,663 --> 02:01:06,264
[SPEAKER_09]: It is too early to celebrate Christmas.

1358
02:01:06,284 --> 02:01:06,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1359
02:01:07,145 --> 02:01:08,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get a small soapbox here.

1360
02:01:08,847 --> 02:01:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, listen.

1361
02:01:11,718 --> 02:01:16,739
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta talk about Christmas and pushing the Christmas holiday stuff up too early.

1362
02:01:16,759 --> 02:01:20,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally was hearing Christmas music November 1st.

1363
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:23,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we at least push that to after things?

1364
02:01:23,741 --> 02:01:27,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a person in our neighborhood put Christmas decorations up October 31st.

1365
02:01:27,522 --> 02:01:32,663
[SPEAKER_02]: They had it out there with their Halloween stuff and their Trump stuff.

1366
02:01:33,644 --> 02:01:38,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still crazy, though, that we have people putting up inflatable decorations on

1367
02:01:40,071 --> 02:01:41,653
[SPEAKER_02]: in October for Christmas.

1368
02:01:41,713 --> 02:01:43,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just give it a rest.

1369
02:01:43,755 --> 02:01:49,602
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot be in holiday season for just a couple weeks and then go into it.

1370
02:01:49,662 --> 02:01:50,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just...

1371
02:01:51,206 --> 02:01:52,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give it a break.

1372
02:01:52,947 --> 02:01:54,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas music, November 1st.

1373
02:01:54,348 --> 02:01:54,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

1374
02:01:55,209 --> 02:01:56,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, you guys.

1375
02:01:56,189 --> 02:01:56,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1376
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:57,370
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

1377
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:58,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It came to mind.

1378
02:01:58,931 --> 02:02:01,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Something you said there reminded me of what I really want to say here at the end.

1379
02:02:02,013 --> 02:02:06,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I've been kind of trying to put this on ice because I have a lot of anxiety about it, as I'm sure a lot of you do.

1380
02:02:06,916 --> 02:02:09,358
[SPEAKER_09]: But vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.

1381
02:02:09,438 --> 02:02:11,859
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are here in the U.S., Tuesday is the day to vote.

1382
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:12,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Please vote.

1383
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,301
[SPEAKER_09]: We need the voices to be heard.

1384
02:02:14,461 --> 02:02:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I know everybody's sick of hearing about the presidential election.

1385
02:02:17,663 --> 02:02:19,664
[SPEAKER_09]: We've told you our opinions on that here on the show.

1386
02:02:20,004 --> 02:02:21,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We hope you'll take them to heart.

1387
02:02:35,928 --> 02:02:55,169
[SPEAKER_09]: you never rest on that stuff you go vote anyway because you vote in local elections and have your voice heard and all that other stuff because when they make these ridiculous rules to ban drag reading at the library and to piggyback on something that I said earlier if you hate drag queens reading to children don't take your kid to the event

1388
02:02:56,681 --> 02:02:58,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, what a fucking concept.

1389
02:02:58,542 --> 02:03:02,043
[SPEAKER_09]: But most of those stupid bans are done at the local level.

1390
02:03:02,423 --> 02:03:04,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So those type of elections really matter as well.

1391
02:03:04,303 --> 02:03:05,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So please vote.

1392
02:03:05,523 --> 02:03:10,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure all of you listening will do, but even if I just get one more person to vote that was like, oh shit, that is coming up, right?

1393
02:03:10,465 --> 02:03:11,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess maybe I should return my ballot.

1394
02:03:12,125 --> 02:03:13,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I will consider this a success.

1395
02:03:14,066 --> 02:03:16,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So please vote and do the thing.

1396
02:03:16,606 --> 02:03:17,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Have your voice be heard.

1397
02:03:17,827 --> 02:03:21,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And no matter what happens Tuesday, we'll get through it.

1398
02:03:22,247 --> 02:03:23,467
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm trying to be hopeful.

1399
02:03:23,827 --> 02:03:29,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to, as was said on Saturday night, keep calm-a-la and carry on-a-la.

1400
02:03:31,149 --> 02:03:32,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the Saturday Night Live bit?

1401
02:03:32,489 --> 02:03:32,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

1402
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:33,869
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so fucking good.

1403
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:34,229
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1404
02:03:34,729 --> 02:03:35,169
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1405
02:03:35,269 --> 02:03:42,711
[SPEAKER_09]: On that note, as was the Chapel Roan song about her pleasing women, that was an amazing thing as well.

1406
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:45,671
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll need a whole other three hours to talk about that.

1407
02:03:45,751 --> 02:03:48,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So until then, until next week, have a wonderful week, everybody.

1408
02:03:48,772 --> 02:03:49,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.

1409
02:03:51,129 --> 02:03:53,550
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1410
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:58,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1411
02:04:00,751 --> 02:04:08,033
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for our live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

1412
02:04:09,593 --> 02:04:19,135
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1413
02:04:21,938 --> 02:04:22,664
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week.
