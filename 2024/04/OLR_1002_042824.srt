1
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's enforcement of its properties tends to come in waves.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Viral fan Project Darlings are shut down quickly, but others that exist below the radar tend to grow until getting caught in a sweep of types of major offenders.

3
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:26,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my hypothesis that Nintendo properties being taken down from Garry's Mod is part of these sweeps, either because of the big-end success in Hollywood, generative AI's growth, or both.

4
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:28,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlicensed constructible elements are seeing the axe.

5
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:37,026
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Litigation Headline, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:47,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:58,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with our 1000th and second episode

[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here every week with you all for 1000 plus weeks with my co host say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

13
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

14
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, governor.

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

16
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,243
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?

17
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:17,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

18
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:18,603
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

19
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:21,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you know, it's been a day.

20
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:22,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a tiring day.

21
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:22,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

22
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:23,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a day.

23
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you.

24
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:29,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very, I was out in the sun today and that can be a very dehydrating experience.

25
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:31,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing games IRL.

26
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:37,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I got together with some of my friends from the game Ingress and we were up to no good getting points for our team.

27
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a lot of good, but you know, it's, it's, it's work.

28
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:42,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard work playing games.

29
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:43,775
[SPEAKER_03]: IRL is hard work.

30
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:46,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you, but I guess exercise, et cetera.

31
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:47,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

32
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

33
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll say hello to somebody else who maybe has gotten some exercise in if he ever dusts off that machine in his garage.

34
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tech Master Loki.

35
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:57,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just us anymore.

36
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also things being stored on top of it.

37
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's gotten to that point.

38
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:07,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's just, it's just Legos sitting there.

39
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:08,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Legos?

40
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:17,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's because I had to... By the way, for those that don't know, I'm talking about Loki has a Dance Dance Revolution machine in his garage.

41
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

42
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:18,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

43
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do want to use it.

44
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:21,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to...

45
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:31,160
[SPEAKER_04]: do one of those like bulky trash pickups or whatever because we have a bunch of stuff in the garage that needs to be like thrown out and then the stuff can come off of the dance pads.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a lot.

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:46,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a couple things of a couple containers of Legos that I've had to move around stuff from like back, you know, pre pandemic when I had to move stuff from my desk, which had a ton of Legos there.

48
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

49
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:48,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Use that annual trash pickup.

50
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:52,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a godsend when we were moving to come pick up all the crap we were purging.

51
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:53,507
[SPEAKER_04]: My goodness.

52
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:59,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the thing with that is like they always ask you for the account number and I'm one that like after I pay bills, I throw them away.

53
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like, you know, oh, hey, I need to do the bulky trash pickup.

54
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:03,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I threw that bill away.

55
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:05,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I got to wait another two months for the bill to come.

56
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then the process just repeats itself.

57
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,881
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'll pay it, and then I'll realize, oh yeah, I was gonna do that.

58
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, I threw it away again.

59
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:15,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay it online.

60
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:18,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you get the account number online whenever you need it.

61
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:22,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I tried that once, actually, and I couldn't.

62
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still writing checks in the year 2024?

63
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:24,884
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

64
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:31,646
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I paid them through my bank, but like, it's just, they send the checks to them.

65
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, no, I'm not writing checks.

66
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:34,547
[SPEAKER_04]: God, what?

67
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that old.

68
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:42,529
[SPEAKER_01]: You still they still want you to send in a check and it's like older services.

69
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:50,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, Alan just got a new checkbook and he was showing me he's like, look, they all have little cats on them because of course he got the checkbook where all the cats are printed on the checks.

70
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I still have to pay for ballet by check.

71
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what the fuck do you need a checkbook for?

72
00:03:55,773 --> 00:04:00,294
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's there's that very random occasional one or two things that yeah.

73
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:05,876
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still do that through your bank and it doesn't cost anything.

74
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:18,200
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like a bill pay option that you do that and they cut checks them or if they have like, you know, like say Comcast or something like that, they have it set up where it's electronic because they have them in their system or something.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: But for everybody else, you can

76
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,634
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

77
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,404
[SPEAKER_04]: You told us, but we can't tell you.

78
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, thanks.

79
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:44,805
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not helpful.

80
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:49,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So and then like I never made online accounts with all these different utilities.

81
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:54,351
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I remember, I may have like when I moved in here back in 2009.

82
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:57,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not going to remember that stuff.

83
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

84
00:04:58,553 --> 00:04:59,374
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

85
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:02,275
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you got to keep spreadsheets with all of your stuff on it.

86
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that don't you don't do that.

87
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:05,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

88
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,199
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't even have that.

89
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,299
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

90
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,021
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very... I don't know.

91
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep spreadsheets for so many things.

92
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:21,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Spreadsheets with all your personal information and account numbers sounds like a perfect thing for a hacker to do.

93
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:23,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Not when you also have it encrypted.

94
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:30,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Not when it's behind one of those laser beam security things like in the movie Entrapment with Catherine Zeta-Jones.

95
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:32,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of security.

96
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:37,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And a very ferocious Minna the Cat stands between you and that.

97
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a very big fan of encryption.

98
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:47,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, our chatters are dying to weigh in on this, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific.

99
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:54,583
[SPEAKER_03]: The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, that's V-O-G Network, also available at vognetwork.com.

100
00:05:54,583 --> 00:06:03,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And y'all can chime in with your thoughts, saying Bobby Blackwolf talking about Loki's DDR machine and the Legos saying, the good news is that if there's stuff on top of it, there's no dust on it.

101
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:05,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

102
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:28,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I did check it like I have used it since then and I think it was a few months ago I powered it on just to make sure it was still working Yeah, I mean it doesn't get super dusty in our garage because we don't I don't ever open the garage door at all So it's just whatever is inside the garage Yeah, it's not it's not like covered in dust anything it's just sitting there waiting

103
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,131
[SPEAKER_03]: As Stuart Hunter Matt says, not a drying rack.

104
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:33,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Done that with a DDR machine before.

105
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha.

106
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:37,152
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have our own drying rack.

107
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:38,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper use for the bars.

108
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:40,173
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.

109
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:40,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

110
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And then folks are talking about paper checks.

111
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:49,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby is saying, I usually pay contractors with checks because then they don't charge me the 3% credit card fee.

112
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that makes sense if they're going to charge a fee.

113
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,396
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times they'll still take debit card and not charge the fee.

114
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:54,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.

115
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:55,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on what it is.

116
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:56,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Really depends on what it is.

117
00:06:57,757 --> 00:07:04,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, and Questbuster says, I was not expecting an Entrapment movie reference.

118
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make more obscure movie references more often.

119
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I don't think I would consider that movie particularly obscure.

120
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that it's old.

121
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:18,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, Tigerclaw had asked earlier, anyone watch the Knuckles series this weekend?

122
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,487
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have Paramount+, it was really good.

123
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:23,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Tigerclaw is a supremo top tier Sonic fan.

124
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:31,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Paramount Plus, but I just, I was, we were hosting, I had, I hosted a show last night here locally.

125
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:33,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So took up a good chunk of my weekend.

126
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:33,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

127
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:34,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

128
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:35,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It just really struck me funny.

129
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,320
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have Paramount Plus, it's really good.

130
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it still good if you don't have Paramount Plus?

131
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because you can pirate it.

132
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:43,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is what I'm sure a lot of people are doing.

133
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:45,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care that much.

134
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not opposed to watching it.

135
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:53,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't get around like I watch very little TV and I just didn't get around to it this weekend with the other stuff going on.

136
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:57,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you gotten around to watching any of the Sonic movies?

137
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,274
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

138
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:02,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well then yeah, there's no reason to watch Knuckles right now.

139
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:02,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to catch up.

140
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:03,997
[SPEAKER_04]: You're too far behind.

141
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:04,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed.

142
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:13,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I just you know, I just video video games are my media of choice usually unless I'm stuck on an airplane and can't do anything else but watch a damn movie then

143
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:15,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

144
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Children, you're appearing in the green screen in the background.

145
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:37,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Please stop.

146
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,013
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

147
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,996
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to make them wear green shirts on Sunday nights.

148
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:42,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Green shirts.

149
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be funny.

150
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:45,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just look like a head.

151
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when someone asks, Hey, is that ghost behind you?

152
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:49,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably.

153
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:54,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf says, has Paramount Plus not cracked down on password sharing like everyone else?

154
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably have, but here's the thing.

155
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:02,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki would get through the series before I would have a need to use Paramount Plus again.

156
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:05,000
[SPEAKER_03]: When's Drag Race All Stars 9 starts?

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, but I don't even really watch Drag Race anymore.

158
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:09,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched maybe one episode of this last season.

159
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I just binged all the way through All Stars 8.

160
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 7, sorry.

161
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,568
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 isn't on Apple TV yet.

162
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they release all the episodes at once?

163
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just one of the... Oh, Knuckles?

164
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Knuckles was, yes.

165
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:27,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But not every show is released all at once.

166
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll watch it eventually.

167
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:32,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not super into the lore stuff.

168
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually just watch it because the movies are pretty good.

169
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:35,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Jim Carrey.

170
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:43,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure he's not in the Knuckles series, so... I'll watch the third movie.

171
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:44,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

172
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:52,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice the guy from Happy Endings, Adam Pally, who I think is my favorite gay representation character ever in a show.

173
00:09:52,238 --> 00:10:04,064
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever saw the show Happy Endings, he played the gay guy in that show, which I think is the best representation because I really felt myself in that because he was not like Will and Jack, okay?

174
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:04,704
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like...

175
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:12,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerdy, slobby, like all this, like just like a, but, but just was gay.

176
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you mean like everybody?

177
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:15,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

178
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:16,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

179
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a normal person, but gay.

180
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:22,528
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my favorite representation, honestly.

181
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,890
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in that series I saw in one of the previews.

182
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, Oh, I'm a fan of him.

183
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,090
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty funny.

184
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

185
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:32,152
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

186
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:32,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

187
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:45,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which isn't about TV shows, but it is about some rumors that are getting louder and louder about Nintendo's next Switch.

188
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:49,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, let's talk about this and why this might have some credit to it.

189
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:59,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so then there's a lot of rumors talking about leaks regarding what the switch it to some of the features might be.

190
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these were coming from third party accessory makers.

191
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:08,599
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially saying it is coming from hardware, just makers basically.

192
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardware Makers.

193
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

194
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, there, you know, apparently there's been reports that you know, there's going to be an eight inch 1080p screen developed for it.

195
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:30,136
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other more interesting things is the differences in the joy cons apparently going to be a little bit larger than the previous joy cons.

196
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:37,900
[SPEAKER_04]: However, supposed to be still backwards compatible with the old joy cons, but also that they're going to attach magnetically to the system, which

197
00:11:39,440 --> 00:12:05,126
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds like a recipe for disaster if you ask me because can you imagine holding holding the switch with magnets and then oh this screen just fell out from inside you know like it it just doesn't i'm just gonna store these joy cons on top of my credit card like it just i i like the idea of attaching easier because yeah the the way it slides in is very um tricky sometimes

198
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:10,268
[SPEAKER_04]: However, some of that magnet stuff is pretty powerful though, I gotta say.

199
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can get some pretty strong magnets.

200
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... I... That's... It's like...

201
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:20,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got me worried a little bit.

202
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:21,247
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

203
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:37,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also rumors that apparently the cartridge, it's going to be backwards compatible with the Switch cartridges, but the Switch 2 cartridges themselves are going to be a different format, but still, I guess, slot into the cartridge slots that they have for that.

204
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:38,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

205
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so...

206
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:47,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see, you know, what exactly, if any of this is actually true, for one.

207
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see a 1080p, because that's not a huge upgrade.

208
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why I think this is absolutely 100% true?

209
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:55,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I think it is?

210
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:59,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It is because the upgrades are really not that much.

211
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,714
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm like, oh, this is the most like conservative sort of report on the upgrades on the switch.

212
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:06,414
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it.

213
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:07,495
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is the real deal.

214
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:07,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

215
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:18,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like what it sounds like to me is like when they talk about like 1080p output and stuff like that, it's it's essentially you're going to have the games because, you know, they have like the handheld mode and then they have the

216
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:36,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of docked mode so essentially on the switch to your switch games are kind of kind of play in that docked mode type of setting where the you know the graphics are be slightly higher, you know 1080p type of thing and The screen size being like I think what an inch larger.

217
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's cool.

218
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:48,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the larger screen idea I'm just curious to see what they do with it You know see see what makes this special I guess yeah, what kind of games they got

219
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:54,188
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe if the magnet thing is kind of a gimmick as well.

220
00:13:54,188 --> 00:14:06,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I still feel like there's probably some sort of physical gimmick that maybe this particular hardware manufacturer is not in on, but there's something maybe either in it, you know, or you know, how like the joy cons had the whole like haptic feedback in it.

221
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could feel like you were shaking a jar of marbles or something.

222
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would feel that in the controller.

223
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:16,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, there's gotta be some type of gimmick like that, I would imagine, but

224
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:38,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think like yeah, honestly, I don't think like the magnets are gonna be like a gameplay type thing It's more probably just it's just a way to make the switch joy cons attach easier to the console Yeah, instead of you know having to slide it in there I mean more more so I would be more concerned with it was less attaching the joy cons to the console was more attaching those wrists

225
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,213
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

226
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:18,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, if you get really mad, start shaking it or something, it could could be interesting, but I'm sure there's got to be.

227
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They put those things through tests.

228
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:20,166
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be.

229
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:24,512
[SPEAKER_03]: They were smart enough to make the Switch cartridges taste funny so that kids wouldn't eat them.

230
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,515
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to put them through some type of test.

231
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:31,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess.

232
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:35,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, I don't know.

233
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see some comments in chat.

234
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,380
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says two switches strapped together via magnets.

235
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think this thing is going to be as powerful as two switches.

236
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,682
[SPEAKER_03]: You're giving you're giving Nintendo a lot of credit to be quite honest.

237
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:51,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see Tiger Claw says, I'm sorry.

238
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:56,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It was DarkSakura who said, I'm just ready for the announcement of the announcement trailer for this thing.

239
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:57,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you my money Nintendo.

240
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah well that's the other well weren't they saying that like there it actually may be a thing for this year which was kind of shocking uh i don't think so because i don't think it's going to be i just had thought last week on the show well the gamescom announcement pretty much confirms it's not going to happen this year but i think it was a part of this announcement that was saying they're still trying to decide if they want to do later this year early next year like no it's going to be fiscal year this fiscal year yeah we know that i

241
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,412
[SPEAKER_04]: They would be announcing games around August.

242
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:36,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So assuming that if they were going to launch this year, you would have your announcement at least like one or two months in advance.

243
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:43,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, say August, Perfect Games comm time launch around October, November would be ideal.

244
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:44,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're going to launch this year.

245
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:53,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to do what they did with the Switch, which is they're going to wait to launch in March, announce in January, February, and

246
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,070
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

247
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:11,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve

248
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,111
[SPEAKER_03]: was not just having, you know, some decent games at launch.

249
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say Breath of the Wild was beyond decent.

250
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:44,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, incredible, but, you know, not just having that, but then having the other games stacked in the pipeline ready to go.

251
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:49,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the biggest mistake they made with the Wii U. They didn't have that same pipeline ready with the Wii U and look what happened.

252
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:50,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo

253
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:10,846
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

254
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even that would count as something that could still keep that hardware moving.

255
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:32,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, Mike Duff says Metroid Prime 4 launch title.

256
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:35,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I I could see that as a good launch title.

257
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think that would be enough.

258
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's going to get people to buy the console.

259
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually agree.

260
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't think it's a good launch title.

261
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that's me, me, me saying that.

262
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:51,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And I you all know, I stand like Super Metroid in that franchise, but I'm not sure it is quite

263
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:55,294
[SPEAKER_03]: The most accessible title for the entire family.

264
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:58,656
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good launch window title.

265
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:09,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, maybe like let's say the Switch does launch in October, then maybe Metroid Prime 4 comes out in December or it's the March game.

266
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,022
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the game that comes out in March to, you know, kind of cap off the year, I think would be a great thing.

267
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:14,442
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think

268
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:19,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, doesn't it seem kind of obvious it's going to be some sort of Mario game?

269
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:20,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like a 3D Mario game?

270
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think it's, I think, I would think a Mario Odyssey 2.

271
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think a Mario Odyssey 2 as well.

272
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:29,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think though, like, Prime 4 would be a good holiday title for that first year.

273
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:39,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have the console come out in March, Prime 4 is your holiday title, or one of your holiday titles to come out, because I think that would be a pretty solid title.

274
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:48,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it isn't, yeah, it is a more hardcore game for the console, and certainly there is the audience for that.

275
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:53,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that, you know, that audience isn't going to, say, overlap with people that play Animal Crossing, or, you know, that

276
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:54,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

277
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:58,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, your casual Mario players or something like that.

278
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,533
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to want something that like, you know, parents and young kids all get to enjoy together.

279
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be a Mario type game.

280
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's the fucking launch title.

281
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:09,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

282
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:10,797
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.

283
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:19,502
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't launch with Mario Kart 9 or Mario Kart 10, I guess it would be Mario Kart 10 at this point, because most most I think they've kind of written that the mobile game is Mario Kart 9.

284
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:24,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Mario Kart X, that that has to be the launch title that and that would be the thing that would

285
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,313
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best fucking selling game on the Switch right now?

286
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that Mario Kart 10 would be it.

287
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:36,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's no reason they can't launch with that and Metroid Prime.

288
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,019
[SPEAKER_03]: That could maybe happen.

289
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:38,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that.

290
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:43,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be very, you know, like F-Zero and Pilotwings type of thing.

291
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:47,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, Mario World was really what everybody was buying for.

292
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:48,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

293
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:54,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Bobby says, yeah, Mario Kart X or 10 would give me to buy a Switch 2 immediately.

294
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else, I'd wait.

295
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:58,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably would pick one up right away.

296
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:00,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got a lot of use out of the Switch.

297
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd pick one up right away just for the fucking upgrades.

298
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:22,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd pick one up right away assuming I am assuming here but if it is if it is verified that it will improve the you know frame rate and you know graphical quality even in some cases on some older games like Pokemon Legends, I'll pick one up immediately just for that.

299
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: and the most important thing in this day and age of 2024, Nintendo, that the library is transferable to the new system.

300
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:37,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if it's not, that's ridiculous.

301
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:42,419
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor, I believe if you look, it does say something about digital backwards compatibility.

302
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:42,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's

303
00:21:43,740 --> 00:22:08,540
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking hope so because I don't want to see them have to do the not virtual console but Nintendo switch online you know the retro things online I don't want to see them have to start that over all over again please no please God no upgrade what you've got with new systems or something I don't know how about GameCube already it's time it's time bring back virtual console man bring it back years let's get GameCube now

304
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:13,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think you could make so much more money off virtual console than you could off the subscriptions.

305
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:23,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, in reality, like, it's your $25 a year subscription is essentially three games from for the virtual console.

306
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:32,094
[SPEAKER_04]: You're telling me that people that your average people, you couldn't get an average of three games sold per person that uses that system.

307
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:37,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I I'm telling you, man, there's money that they're leaving on the table with that stuff.

308
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:42,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, but everyone wanted Netflix for games when we had virtual console.

309
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:49,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, just like now, it took Target pulling Blu-rays and DVDs for people to say, Oh, man, I wish Target had Blu-rays and DVDs.

310
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:58,516
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the that's the thing is, yeah, people wanted Netflix of games for, you know, their digital systems.

311
00:22:58,516 --> 00:22:58,717
[SPEAKER_04]: What

312
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:06,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is offering, maybe adding one or two titles every so often, is not Netflix.

313
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Netflix is thousands of titles!

314
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:14,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a huge catalog of games available for all of the Nintendo systems.

315
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is offering CNN+.

316
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:23,829
[SPEAKER_04]: They're offering 2B at this point.

317
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:29,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pittance of what they could offer, and that's the problem right there.

318
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not worth it in a sense there.

319
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, that didn't work.

320
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,091
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried.

321
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:36,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to selling that stuff.

322
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:43,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I know that they're so adverse to discounting stuff, but these old virtual console titles, just put them on sale every once in a while.

323
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:50,516
[SPEAKER_04]: people like myself would like just eat that stuff up and create this huge catalog of stuff that we're just sitting on.

324
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would still be like, Oh, yeah, cool.

325
00:23:52,896 --> 00:24:03,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I get all this stuff, you know, and you'd make so much more money than $25 a year, like so much more on top.

326
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me sorry, I'm just getting to some other comments here, Logie.

327
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:12,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw in chat says, Do you think the switch to will use physical media considering how some stores are doing away with it?

328
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

329
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:18,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, number one, the rumor is actually confirming it's going to be backwards compatible with the cartridges.

330
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:21,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think from that regard, yes.

331
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:31,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also just think I feel like Nintendo will be the last to drop physical and, you know, insert joke about how their tech lags behind.

332
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:41,423
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's something also about it's not that the kids can't do digital, but I think there's something very, you know, like here's the cartridge or something about that that I don't know.

333
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:43,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Nintendo is going to be the last to drop that.

334
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:49,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Flash memory is getting cheaper and cheaper every day, so you can store a lot more on a lot smaller form factors.

335
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:54,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they don't technically need to get away from that.

336
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:15,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Pixelpacas in chat says, hey, 2B is good.

337
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watched Death Becomes Her and Romeo and Michelle on it recently.

338
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know Romeo and Michelle was on it.

339
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:21,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Cute.

340
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

341
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:30,392
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeRight is talking about arcade archives because Bobby was saying, do you really want to pay $5 for Super Mario Brothers again?

342
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:38,639
[SPEAKER_03]: But very interesting counterpoint from OrangeRight, who says, considering arcade archives versus Super Mario Brothers, because there is a difference.

343
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you all know the arcade versus Super Mario Brothers.

344
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,363
[SPEAKER_03]: is available in arcade archives on Switch.

345
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:46,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the Switch, not PS5.

346
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: But Orange Rite reminds us that game is almost always in the top 20.

347
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people do seem to be buying it all over again.

348
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:57,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, there are differences.

349
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:00,518
[SPEAKER_03]: The versus is, of course, a lot harder.

350
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:04,461
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is some interesting perspective on that, is that arcade archives

351
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were just talking about that last week show.

352
00:26:07,343 --> 00:26:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: There's hundreds of games in that series.

353
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:14,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that is the pay what you're going to play type of model.

354
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:16,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, there's a lot of obscure as fuck games in there.

355
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:17,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make them bad, though.

356
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,227
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some really neat gems.

357
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:20,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

358
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:27,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, that takes some money to publish those and get those, you know, ported over and emulated and stuff like that.

359
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So

360
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:50,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it must be somewhat successful if they're doing so many of them like they wouldn't be doing like 100 some titles if they weren't selling like I just I have a hard time believing that they can't hold the phone here a minute hold the phone Narcissus says I did buy arcade archive Donkey Kong.

361
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:53,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So depending on how the emulation is, I might buy them piecemeal again.

362
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:55,599
[SPEAKER_03]: They put Donkey Kong on arcade archives.

363
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know with with the pie factory and everything.

364
00:26:58,942 --> 00:26:59,162
[SPEAKER_03]: That's

365
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:04,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get that.

366
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have what's the other Nintendo a Popeye?

367
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:07,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be so excited.

368
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Licensing probably makes that a pain in the ass.

369
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:15,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they have Popeye on what other Nintendo arcade arcade games are there?

370
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,900
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, I didn't know Donkey Kong was in it.

371
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play the Pie Factory again.

372
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:21,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Donkey Kong three in it, too?

373
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:25,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy moly.

374
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:26,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to look.

375
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:28,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

376
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

377
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I learned.

378
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:33,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm dusting off my switch to play a game from 1984.

379
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,380
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

380
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:40,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether they are 40 year old games or not.

381
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,747
[SPEAKER_03]: In a segment called How was your gaming week?

382
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,868
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, we'll go to you.

383
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:44,649
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

384
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:48,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a little frustrating to be honest.

385
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:52,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did play some Dead by Daylight, of course.

386
00:27:52,331 --> 00:28:04,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, also played, um, uh, Dracula XX Nocturne in the Moonlight, which was the, uh, original name for, uh, Symphony of the Night.

387
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing the Saturn version and made it to the Upside Down Castle and did some bosses and ran around and

388
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:17,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally causing chaos in Alucard's dad's house.

389
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:20,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he doesn't like any of the house guests he's got over.

390
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:35,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I also tried to play my lovely avatar game, but it's been set for, we're patching, try in a couple of hours, for about a week now.

391
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:43,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to tell everybody something, because instead of going onto the, well, I mean, you can go onto the forums and bitch about it, but file a fucking ticket.

392
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:50,641
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how anyone in tech gets heat on any freaking type of thing.

393
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,682
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to file a ticket.

394
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:59,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Tickets go to a report, they compile numbers, and they work on them by order of report.

395
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:03,547
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't file a ticket, it doesn't get the heat it needs to get.

396
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:12,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on one of those very bored nights when I could not play around with my blue people, I played Islands of Insight.

397
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:18,171
[SPEAKER_01]: The behavior puzzle MMO weird game.

398
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:19,773
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.

399
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:28,902
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to like one of these little islands that had some of my favorite kinds of puzzles and I call it the sort of P.O.P.O.

400
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Puzzle.

401
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:31,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to get

402
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:37,800
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four in a row of certain color things and you have to completely clear out the board.

403
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a matter of knowing which items to switch around.

404
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:49,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can only switch around things that would lead to a row being deleted.

405
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:52,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to look ahead and see how they're going to cascade and fall.

406
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my favorite puzzles.

407
00:29:55,629 --> 00:30:11,316
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some really interesting spatial puzzles that I like, like where you see these rings, and most of them are gold, and then you'll have two that are sort of like a brass patina, you know, that kind of bluish-greenish color?

408
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:21,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to look through just the gold rings, so you have to stand in just the right angle to see through just the gold without looking through the brass.

409
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:23,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty cool.

410
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:29,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, even some things, like, that don't seem like they're a puzzle at first end up being puzzles.

411
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:40,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just everything has hidden puzzle after hidden puzzle and you have follow puzzles, you know, where you have to follow something to a certain perspective and all kinds of fun stuff.

412
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:42,384
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really neat game.

413
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:48,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also played a game I'm going to be talking about later, like very soon later.

414
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:55,971
[SPEAKER_01]: that predates something.

415
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff that does stuff.

416
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:05,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before we go to Loki, I want to follow up on this because a lot of people in chat have been talking about the arcade archives thing with Nintendo.

417
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:12,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually went to look up what are all of the games that Nintendo has put out on arcade archives or arcade archive games that are published by Nintendo?

418
00:31:13,686 --> 00:31:14,947
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ton.

419
00:31:14,947 --> 00:31:16,048
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ton of them.

420
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:32,760
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the Arcade Archive series, 304 games in Arcade Archives, 108 also in Neo Geo, which I mean, that means like the Neo Geo library is like pretty much everything that's ever been on an arcade machine for Neo Geo is in this Arcade Archives, by the way.

421
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,381
[SPEAKER_03]: But get this from Nintendo.

422
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read the entire list.

423
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea all of these games were on it.

424
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:41,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready?

425
00:31:41,883 --> 00:32:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Clue Clueland, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Donkey Kong 3, Excitebike, Golf, Ice Climber, Mario Bros., Pinball, Punch Out, Skyskipper, Soccer, Super Punch Out, Urban Champion, vs. Balloon Fight, vs. Baseball, vs. Mahjong, vs. Super Mario Bros., vs. Tennis, vs. Wrecking Crew.

426
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:10,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, I had no idea half of those games were even ever arcade things at one point.

427
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know Nintendo had their pay choice every day.

428
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:15,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea half those games were even in them ever.

429
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:16,914
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's I'm like, what?

430
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:18,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind blown.

431
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Popeye not on the list.

432
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:23,539
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I'm just assuming that's a more complex licensing sort of thing.

433
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:24,059
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

434
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:24,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all the games.

435
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like what?

436
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,322
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20 games by Nintendo in the arcade archives.

437
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:28,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

438
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:38,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I stand corrected.

439
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:49,028
[SPEAKER_03]: They have come out slowly over the years from 2017 was versus Super Mario Brothers all the way through 2020 was some of the like Super Punch-Out was in 2020.

440
00:32:49,028 --> 00:32:51,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wow.

441
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:54,889
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, shut me up.

442
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:59,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says I didn't even know there was an arcade version of Nintendo pinball, right?

443
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither did I. I never even knew that was in the the the pay choice cabinets.

444
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:05,032
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?

445
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo pinball was pretty good.

446
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:09,869
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, we can go to your gaming week.

447
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, but very important information, vital information we needed to share.

448
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:16,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It was important.

449
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:26,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically play the same stuff as I played last week, so I've been playing through still a lot of Turbo Kid and just kind of progressing through that.

450
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,340
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is really, really hard.

451
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,742
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's one of those things I got to a boss now that's like,

452
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:55,078
[SPEAKER_04]: just it seems very difficult to fight and so I may have to go like other places to get more power-ups because it's a metroidvania and you know that's how that works but I see a lot of parallels with this and obviously metroid you know the the sewer area that I'm in is very you know brinstar and stuff like that so it's um

453
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:57,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it quite a bit.

454
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very well done game.

455
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot recommend it enough.

456
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course Minecraft.

457
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been actually working on my build for my next episode.

458
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:08,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I filmed the beginning of it already.

459
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,751
[SPEAKER_04]: The build is done, essentially.

460
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an arcade slash casino.

461
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:20,836
[SPEAKER_04]: More casino than arcade, but you know, you can't really make arcade games compact in Minecraft.

462
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:23,159
[SPEAKER_04]: That just doesn't work.

463
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've got like a lot of like, I gotta put a DVR machine there, of course.

464
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:29,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lots of lights and stuff.

465
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:33,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing with the new shaders that are out for complimentary.

466
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:50,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially they have colored lighting in there which is like a brand new thing for like Minecraft shaders and stuff and with that though like I've been trying to simulate black light and stuff like that in there and we have a mod called Immersive Paintings which allows us to put in like

467
00:34:51,718 --> 00:35:20,700
[SPEAKER_04]: image files essentially into the game kind of like paintings and so without having to like go and create a custom map art and stuff like that that would take forever to do this is just kind of throw it in there and you can make some really large things so I've got it's coming along pretty good and then the last thing I was doing today was actually setting up the soundscape for it because I set up a bunch of jukeboxes with our custom music discs and stuff so you can put custom audio files on there so I have like

468
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried doing arcade ambient sounds.

469
00:35:26,521 --> 00:35:28,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade ambient sounds are too loud.

470
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:34,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't think... I don't remember going to the arcades.

471
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:42,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while, but you don't realize how loud arcades are with all the games kind of playing their music and sound effects all at the same time.

472
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:43,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not...

473
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:55,715
[SPEAKER_04]: great so i have to end up going with like kind of like a casino like ambient sound instead but i have like a fake video game thing and i've got some music that i

474
00:35:57,182 --> 00:36:02,045
[SPEAKER_04]: borrowed from StepMania for the DDR machine that's in the arcade as well.

475
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:05,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all those together kind of sound really cool.

476
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:08,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to keep it so that the audio is contained within the area of the arcade.

477
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:13,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you come up to it, you kind of hear like what it sounds like walking up to an arcade in a mall or something like that.

478
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be pretty cool.

479
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:25,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Way too much detail put into a very small build that was meant to just kind of bridge the gap of time between releasing episodes because I'm still working on enormous

480
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:33,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Theme Park Ride, which really should have been like so many episodes worth of content that, um, but I, I'm not operating like that.

481
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to put it all out at once.

482
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just taking a very long time to do that.

483
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:42,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, they'll be coming out probably this week.

484
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:42,857
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

485
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:42,997
Cool.

486
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:45,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, my gaming week.

487
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:47,915
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the usual, Final Fantasy XIV.

488
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I still played a little Dead by Daylight.

489
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:50,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Go me.

490
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit, not a lot.

491
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:56,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I snuck in Diablo IV as well.

492
00:36:56,901 --> 00:37:06,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game I probably spent the most amount of time on was continuing, because I talked about it just a little bit last week, Aiden Chronicle, which I had backed on Kickstarter.

493
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:08,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing that, continuing through that.

494
00:37:08,948 --> 00:37:11,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm about 11 or 12 hours in at this point.

495
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's definitely, you know, everything I said last week about it's a PlayStation One RPG for better and for worse, kind of still all holds true.

496
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that got a little annoying, I don't know if I ran into a bug or what happened, but I got to this part of the game where like no

497
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:39,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Monsters started spawning for some reason, like it just got to a point where there were no random encounters that ended up happening at some point.

498
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:44,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what the heck was happening.

499
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like this game still has a lot of little bugs that need to be addressed.

500
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:51,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I get it.

501
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a smaller team.

502
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:53,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Kickstarter project.

503
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:56,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, you know, it's a different kind of thing.

504
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:56,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But

505
00:37:57,185 --> 00:38:21,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really getting annoyed this is a thing and this is the thing with games gaming in the year 2024 this is like every game now it's not unique to IUDM but it's just like this is also what I was hoping for as part of the like PlayStation 1 JRPG era is that there wouldn't be freaking patches having to address things that are broken with the game or

506
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:28,119
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of life things they want to change later on like they did with Final Fantasy 15 or a variety of other games.

507
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:35,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I thought video game sales and success was really made or broken in the first week of sales.

508
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:47,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never been more discouraged than I am now to not buy games the first week they come out because I feel like you're never going to actually play the finished product within the first week.

509
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:55,153
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're better off waiting six months for them to do all the patches while all the real players are in there doing the testing.

510
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:59,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you know, do the do the quality of life changes and things like that.

511
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:05,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I again, I want to stress I understand this is a problem in the industry that is not unique to Aiden.

512
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:11,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just one of those things where I was just kind of sitting there going, should I have just waited six months before playing this?

513
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:17,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what the fuck I've been waiting since like 2017 or whenever they started this Kickstarter, what would another six months have done?

514
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:29,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in a really, really weird way, I think that's what's been stopping me from playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

515
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:33,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually, from what I understand, that game actually is pretty solid and probably doesn't need patches.

516
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:40,085
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't help but feel in the back of my mind like, I'm going to wait a few months and make sure I'm playing the actual like finished version of that game.

517
00:39:42,353 --> 00:39:47,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobbie says, apparently on PC, random encounters were tied to refresh rate.

518
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:50,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you had a high refresh rate, you'd never get a random encounter.

519
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:55,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm on PS5, but yes.

520
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:59,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, PS5 is only rendering at 1080p, is what I heard.

521
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even playing 4K.

522
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:04,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Just why even like tie anything to refresh rate?

523
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:08,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, have we not learned since Bethesda?

524
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:15,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, literally, Fallout 4, you know, locked 60 FPS because all the physics are tied to the framerate.

525
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:23,603
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster in chat says, I feel really mixed on Ayudin so far, but I'm still willing to keep pushing.

526
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:25,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, like, don't get me wrong.

527
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,944
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of things I like about it.

528
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The story's kind of interesting.

529
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:36,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I got to a point where, you know, and again, I want to be very aware of spoilers, but like, the game kind of pulled a Final Fantasy VIII.

530
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I mean by that is that then all of a sudden, it flipped to these other characters.

531
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:44,890
[SPEAKER_03]: that were like out of nowhere and new.

532
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,071
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like remember Final Fantasy VIII?

533
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say it was pretending to be a good game.

534
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, stop.

535
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:56,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it's a good game, but there are things that hold it back from being a great game.

536
00:40:56,835 --> 00:41:02,878
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say, you remember when you were playing like the main story of Final Fantasy VIII and then all of a sudden you were like, what's Laguna?

537
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that his name?

538
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:03,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Laguna.

539
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:05,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you flipped over to that.

540
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:08,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was a moment of that.

541
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what?

542
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:12,858
[SPEAKER_01]: or like starting Kingdom Hearts 2

543
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:34,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf says they may not have been able to afford great devs who have learned those lessons already.

544
00:41:34,645 --> 00:41:38,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why I'm like, I'm like, not, I'm not trying to completely shit on the game.

545
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:42,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm also recognizing this is like, this is a problem with every game.

546
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:50,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's something, you know, I see every time I'm playing one of these games, when they release, I'm sitting here going, look at me, the fool again.

547
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I should know better, but I never do.

548
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I never learn.

549
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:57,155
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster says, Aiden's sprites are so well done.

550
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:58,856
[SPEAKER_03]: The artist really did a good job with them.

551
00:41:58,856 --> 00:41:59,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

552
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:01,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the characters are interesting too.

553
00:42:01,557 --> 00:42:08,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are very tropey anime or JRPG, but some of them are kind of like, they're really interesting.

554
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there's definitely some characters I like having in my party more than others because there is different dialogue, additional dialogue that changes depending on who's in your party.

555
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty neat.

556
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:34,370
[SPEAKER_03]: My advice to all of you that are playing through the game, though, is that when certain big things happen in the story, don't forget to go back and revisit every single town you've been to before because you never know, somebody might be there new to recruit.

557
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:39,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, but to be fair, that is exactly what happened in Suikoden.

558
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:39,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So

559
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I think there are lots of people that wanted to back a brand new PlayStation 1 Suikoden and congratulations that that is exactly what you got for better and for worse.

560
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:55,834
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

561
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I do enjoy it overall, though.

562
00:42:57,235 --> 00:43:00,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just these little frustrations get very frustrating.

563
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:02,137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

564
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:02,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

565
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:04,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some other news.

566
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:08,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything else to really talk about during my gaming week.

567
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I already mentioned on last week's show, but I'll say it again.

568
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:14,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not be here Memorial Day weekend, but you got some time to worry about that.

569
00:43:14,128 --> 00:43:15,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still about a month away.

570
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:25,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get to some news and what is going on in the industry, starting off with what was some disappointing news for some fans this week, Loki.

571
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:26,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

572
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:29,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those single player missions in Overwatch 2,

573
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzcon is cancelled this year.

574
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:43,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not going to be happening but they said that they're going to be doing something a little bit different for World of Warcraft being that

575
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:49,825
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, of course, they're going to have some anniversaries and whatnot for the 30th anniversary of Warcraft.

576
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:53,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be some in-person events for that as well.

577
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:59,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, you know, of course, they have the Vessel of Hatred expansion coming out later this year as well.

578
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So probably do something along the lines with that.

579
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:08,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, they just don't have anything really new to announce, I guess.

580
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why they're not doing their event.

581
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:37,325
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i'm i'm mixed on this you know um i'm into a lot of the blizzard stuff again like obviously there were some dark years but i'm into diablo again wow the last wow expansion was one of the better ones in a really long time um and i feel like blizzard's kind of getting their footing again that being said i'm not incredibly surprised to hear this news because and i i really don't know how else to put this for blizzcon but

582
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The vibes just aren't right this year.

583
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:42,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's really what it is.

584
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,047
[SPEAKER_03]: The vibes are off this year.

585
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:47,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that has to do with the layoffs is a huge part of that.

586
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:50,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely a vibe killer.

587
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:55,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that Blizzard has, you know, never had layoffs before and still, but I just think something is weird about that.

588
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:05,552
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole Microsoft cloud and the question, not the not the Internet cloud, but like the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the Microsoft merger, which ties into what I just talked about as well.

589
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:09,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, there's a brand new CEO, right?

590
00:45:09,193 --> 00:45:11,533
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had that transition as well.

591
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:20,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we know that Microsoft would probably encourage Blizzard to do BlizzCon because Blizzard has a strong community.

592
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see BlizzCon turning into a MicrosoftCon.

593
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:31,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Microsoft is foolish to not subtly place their products under the Blizz crowd that might be

594
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:34,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV Fan Convention

595
00:45:52,040 --> 00:46:11,554
[SPEAKER_03]: why not show a little bit of that or some of the other things just you know again i'm not saying make it the focus of the key because i know there would be a lot of fans that would say stuff like because when they put call of duty into battle net oh did fans lose their fucking mind and i get you know i i get it because call of duty is not fucking adjacent to anything else blizzard does

596
00:46:12,435 --> 00:46:21,410
[SPEAKER_03]: But Microsoft might have some things like, dare I say something like Sea of Thieves, if they ever do another Dungeon Siege, that's pretty similar to Diablo.

597
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are some games that are just, and I'm not, don't don't let them take up the air in the room.

598
00:46:27,694 --> 00:46:30,535
[SPEAKER_03]: but why not have them over just a little?

599
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:37,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another little row of tables you can visit that doesn't have as long of a line where we're pitching a few other things you might be into.

600
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:42,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Microsoft, I think, would be foolish to not take that opportunity even if there was a BlizzCon.

601
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:54,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take up all the air of the Blizzard stuff, but have a little, you know, aside, a little, you know, food truck sponsored by Microsoft product or whatever that whole thing is, you know, going on.

602
00:46:55,379 --> 00:47:00,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a little surprised, but I'm also just like, you know what?

603
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It does seem like the vibes are off, but I'd be very curious to see what they end up doing next year.

604
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:23,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feeling, and I'm really tinfoil hatting here, I have a feeling now that Microsoft is back in control, I think we will get an announcement maybe next year, and this will be worth having a blizzcon for, that there's going to be an Overwatch 3.

605
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, I mean, and I kind of feel like that should be obvious news, right?

606
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:32,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Overwatch, they're going to keep trying to make that happen.

607
00:47:32,754 --> 00:47:34,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I think is going to happen with Overwatch 3.

608
00:47:36,894 --> 00:47:42,616
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna revert a lot of shit back to Overwatch 1, is what's gonna happen in Overwatch 3.

609
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:51,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything, but I think there's gonna be some things that irritate people with Overwatch 2.

610
00:47:51,079 --> 00:48:00,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there is some Activision influence there, and I think some of it's gonna subtly shift back to what you liked in Overwatch 1, and Overwatch 3 will hopefully be

611
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:02,282
[SPEAKER_03]: the game.

612
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:09,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I might be I might be daydreaming a little bit, but they'll call it Overwatch 1 O.N.E.

613
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,427
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just taking a page out of the Xbox One.

614
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:15,509
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it'll be Overwatch 3, but fans will know.

615
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:17,129
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be winks and nods.

616
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:24,773
[SPEAKER_03]: All they have to do is say it's going back to 6v6 and fans will absolutely know what it is.

617
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:27,234
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going back to two tanks.

618
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:28,495
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll know.

619
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

620
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

621
00:48:31,402 --> 00:48:32,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll see.

622
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:35,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a long shot, but I feel like that's the type of thing that would make- I don't know.

623
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:43,437
[SPEAKER_04]: In this climate of the video game industry nowadays, it's like hard for me to like think, yeah, they're gonna do the right thing.

624
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:48,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, they're gonna do the profitable thing.

625
00:48:48,102 --> 00:48:48,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

626
00:48:49,248 --> 00:49:10,207
[SPEAKER_03]: sj100mat says no problem having daddy microsoft pay the bill for blizzcon while showing off a few games running via game pass on some xboxes yeah sj100mat also says they got to be careful with overwatch 3 they can't mess it up out the gate like they did with 2 they can't make overwatch 1.75 fans won't stand for it oh i know and i think i think

627
00:49:11,189 --> 00:49:17,911
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if there was any CEO out there going, gamers are stupid, they'll buy this bullshit, was Bobby Kotick.

628
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:19,671
[SPEAKER_03]: He's no longer in the picture.

629
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:27,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there will be a better understanding when it comes to... I mean, yeah, is it wishful thinking on my part?

630
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit.

631
00:49:28,414 --> 00:49:36,256
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just feel like if now is the time to fix what the fan issues were with that game, and I think the biggest thing they could do for Overwatch 3

632
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how this happens with all the layoffs that just happened, but maybe if Microsoft is willing to allocate some resources, it could.

633
00:49:45,005 --> 00:49:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Overwatch 3 is demoed with a PvE mode.

634
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, here it is, it's in the game.

635
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:53,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

636
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:55,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, we're going back to 6v6.

637
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:58,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'd get people super hyped for the game.

638
00:49:58,293 --> 00:49:58,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the case.

639
00:50:00,202 --> 00:50:03,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I realize Overwatch 2 does have a PvE mode.

640
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:06,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know it's fucking buried under you know, it's it's a paywall.

641
00:50:06,747 --> 00:50:10,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's not at all what we wanted it to be.

642
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that the EA Sports logo?

643
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:13,472
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the game.

644
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:16,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the game.

645
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it was at one point.

646
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:19,877
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

647
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:29,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this story which is a little bit, I don't know, it's kind of a bummer but also not surprising.

648
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:33,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a comment from the ESA this week.

649
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,924
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a hearing that happened recently on the topic of game preservation.

650
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:54,030
[SPEAKER_03]: and lawyer Steve England on behalf of the Electronic Software Association, the ESA, the group that used to put on E3 until they failed at being able to do so anymore and they were mismanaged for several years, allegedly.

651
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:01,533
[SPEAKER_03]: My perspective is that they were mismanaged for several years and they no longer are able to do E3, but they are still out there advocating

652
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:04,355
[SPEAKER_03]: for the industry and this is how they're choosing to do it.

653
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:10,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So lawyer Steve England was asked about online libraries being allowed to preserve vintage games.

654
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So an online library preserving a vintage game.

655
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:23,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve England replied, there's no combination of limitations ESA members would support to provide remote access.

656
00:51:23,649 --> 00:51:30,675
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, physical building and I'm summarizing here, physical buildings, housing collections of vintage games aren't the answer either.

657
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Online archives with few restrictions would be insufficient progress when it comes to properly preserving video game history.

658
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:50,140
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were other speakers that made it clear something has to be done to make sure game preservation can continue no matter what the ESA members and right holders are trying to get out here.

659
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, gaming history could be lost forever.

660
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:59,707
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that, that there's all these elements of gaming history, especially as games are harder to find, disappear, go offline, da-da-da.

661
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:14,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Kendra Albert, a technology lawyer at the same panel, said that the ESA basically has been unwilling to work with preservationists, that proposals are never enough to pacify rights holders of the games in question.

662
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:26,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil Salvador, the Video Game History Foundation Library Director, argued that public libraries lack the resources or knowledge to create and curate meaningful collections of video games.

663
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:26,972
[SPEAKER_03]: For reference,

664
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:36,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Library of Congress once attempted to do a framework for game preservation and the ESA stopped this and stated this work is best done by publishers.

665
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, ESA?

666
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?

667
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:39,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?

668
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.

669
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

670
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:46,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that just like how, oh, we shouldn't be regulated in the sense of, you know, our rating system?

671
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:48,104
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'll we'll do that ourselves.

672
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:59,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that why the Video Game History Foundation discovered that 87% of games released before 2010 are endangered and probably going to be lost?

673
00:52:59,597 --> 00:53:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So just I...

674
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:08,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the ESA, definitely not advocating for the consumer, but that's not really who they're for.

675
00:53:08,032 --> 00:53:13,956
[SPEAKER_03]: They are for the industry, but I think they're swinging the pendulum a little too hard on this.

676
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:16,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're doing themselves any favors.

677
00:53:16,718 --> 00:53:25,825
[SPEAKER_03]: We already know the ESA has, you know, I'm also, I'm still sitting here going, what is the ESA good for at this point?

678
00:53:25,825 --> 00:53:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm one of these publishers, and this is what they choose to lobby?

679
00:53:32,156 --> 00:53:38,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a, I mean, and I'm sure there are some game publishers out there very happy with the ESA stance on this.

680
00:53:38,722 --> 00:53:43,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it from that money making dollar sign perspective.

681
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:55,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, like if a game is not available through any legal means, I'm sorry, it is ethically okay to pirate that game at that point.

682
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:58,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if, if you're not selling it,

683
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:03,399
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I supposed to be able to get this, you know, experience this game?

684
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:11,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if that could be for research, for studying for future game development, for all these types of purposes beyond just playing it for fun.

685
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:15,528
[SPEAKER_03]: These games should be accessible as things to learn from.

686
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:18,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't even say necessarily it being accessible publicly.

687
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:23,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say is if my pirating a game

688
00:54:24,864 --> 00:54:25,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you

689
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hurting anything.

690
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,881
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like they're selling that game on the Switch Store or something like that.

691
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing.

692
00:54:58,162 --> 00:55:04,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel a lot of times they try to push this argument with a lot of things that they're losing money.

693
00:55:04,226 --> 00:55:11,110
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, don't care if you're losing money because you're making billions of dollars doing all sorts of predatory sales stuff anyways.

694
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've tried to make that argument with used games.

695
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:16,073
[SPEAKER_04]: They've tried to make that argument with rentals.

696
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:17,614
[SPEAKER_04]: They've tried to make that argument with

697
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So many things and like frankly it doesn't seem to really matter because it to them it's just we're just not making enough money because our shareholders are pressuring us to make more money for them and it's never going to be feasible so they try to like pick up whatever pennies they can in this case if they're stopping video game preservation so they can get you to buy the sequel or get you to buy the re-release or the remaster or whatever the case may be.

698
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:46,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, oh boy.

699
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:59,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm looking at the ESA website right now, by the way, and on the ESA website, I was curious, like, well, what things have this, and y'all know I've made this point before, in their own words, what things have the ESA done recently for the industry?

700
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:03,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two articles from the entire year 2024 so far.

701
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,090
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two articles.

702
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:05,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear.

703
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,151
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is a report, U.S.

704
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:09,411
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer video game spending totaled $57.2 billion in 2023.

705
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't do that.

706
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:10,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an article.

707
00:56:15,634 --> 00:56:19,560
[SPEAKER_03]: The following statement on the nomination of Deborah Robinson to service the U.S.

708
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator.

709
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:23,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thanks.

710
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:25,009
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

711
00:56:26,656 --> 00:56:27,957
[SPEAKER_03]: and it gets into the top grossing games.

712
00:56:27,957 --> 00:56:31,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm not sure what the ESA had to do with any of this, but OK.

713
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:44,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this from January, the Entertainment Software Association statement of support for the appointment of Sharon Israel, who is the now the chief policy officer and director for international affairs at the U.S.

714
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:47,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent and Trademark Office.

715
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:51,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank God there's someone at the Patent Office to think about those video games.

716
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:55,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried there for a second that we might not have, you know, even more

717
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Patent exploitation by corporations.

718
00:56:59,595 --> 00:57:04,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two things that the ESA has done this year in their own words.

719
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:06,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So they haven't done anything.

720
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,902
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like LinkedIn news articles that they put out.

721
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:11,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on, like it's it's garbage.

722
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:14,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It's garbage.

723
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:14,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

724
00:57:14,845 --> 00:57:25,192
[SPEAKER_03]: SSU 100 Matt in chat says ESA is wearing Zubaz pants, drinking new Coke, giving us the thumbs up while we buy Super Mario Brothers 3 for the 15th time on a new system.

725
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:25,912
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

726
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,974
[SPEAKER_03]: At least Super Mario Brothers 3 is available.

727
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll I'll say that much.

728
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:32,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwolf says arcade archives.

729
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:32,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

730
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:35,159
[SPEAKER_03]: A great example of arcade preservation.

731
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:35,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

732
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Hats off to SNK.

733
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:42,708
[SPEAKER_03]: That Neo Geo stuff is preserved.

734
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:46,954
[SPEAKER_04]: If Gauntlet Legends ever came out on Archaic Archives, day one.

735
00:57:46,954 --> 00:57:47,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

736
00:57:48,638 --> 00:57:55,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some folks are pointing out, well, I think there's certain illegal means to get it, but there's also the Dreamcast version.

737
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hello, hello.

738
00:57:57,661 --> 00:57:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at who you're talking to here.

739
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know, like, I'm 100% aware of what I need to do.

740
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:05,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I'm just saying, like, to be educated.

741
00:58:05,784 --> 00:58:06,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

742
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not need to be educated.

743
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:08,585
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just saying that, like,

744
00:58:09,938 --> 00:58:15,105
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, even going back to Steam, like, I'd rather purchase it through legal means.

745
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:21,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, give me those legal means to do that, like, for sure.

746
00:58:21,013 --> 00:58:21,774
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

747
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:27,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says we must chat-splain this to Loki.

748
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:27,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

749
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

750
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:35,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I love- You're telling me there's software free on the internet and I don't have to pay for it?

751
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:46,236
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is one of the few video game podcasts, not the only, but we're one of the few video game podcasts out there that can, where the host can be chat-splained to by their listeners.

752
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:47,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually kind of enjoy it though.

753
00:58:47,517 --> 00:58:48,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they're right.

754
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Not always, but sometimes they're right.

755
00:58:51,769 --> 00:59:09,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, like, there is an area, like, for sure, there is an area, and I think Gauntlet Legends, for me, is kind of that, like, barrier, like, newer, modern arcade games, like, that is a little beyond my understanding right now of how to play on my computer type of thing.

756
00:59:09,035 --> 00:59:15,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, some of those that run on PC, like, actual PC hardware in the arcades, you know, more, like,

757
00:59:15,777 --> 00:59:17,598
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has something that's in a similar type of vein.

758
00:59:37,955 --> 00:59:39,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

759
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:51,105
[SPEAKER_01]: There basically has appeared this yellow Nintendo cartridge that was labeled NOACOPY-22387.

760
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:58,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this is, is a prototype version of The Legend of Zelda, the US release.

761
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:05,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a little bit, I think, related back to the Famicom Disk version.

762
01:00:05,914 --> 01:00:08,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I played it.

763
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:12,577
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I got through, like, the first level of it and didn't really see any differences.

764
01:00:12,577 --> 01:00:26,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But comparing the code side by side visually, there looks like there are some differences, at least back end.

765
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:27,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I don't read binary.

766
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:41,658
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that they found, and for the record he put up the whole image up there, it's like you can contain the whole thing in one image and someone re-dumped it back to the ROM.

767
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:57,460
[SPEAKER_01]: One bug that was observed in that is that when you exit a cave, Link remains under the ground for the last position of one frame before teleporting to the entrance.

768
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked.

769
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I was tired.

770
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't notice.

771
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:03,024
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, overall...

772
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:08,065
[SPEAKER_01]: It was exactly the Legend of Zelda that I remembered playing.

773
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:15,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they find more differences out there, then I would really like to see what they end up being.

774
01:01:15,347 --> 01:01:18,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually following this guy on Twitter.

775
01:01:18,568 --> 01:01:22,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mr. Talida.

776
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:28,471
[SPEAKER_01]: As a point, I'm trying not to spend any time on Twitter, but I don't know where else I can find this guy.

777
01:01:28,471 --> 01:01:33,173
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to see if there are any other differences that come up from this.

778
01:01:34,502 --> 01:01:37,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love these prototype cartridges getting found and all this.

779
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:41,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is some of the most interesting stuff that's out there.

780
01:01:41,093 --> 01:01:43,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I love to see the

781
01:01:44,926 --> 01:01:45,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Prototype

782
01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:11,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really neat.

783
01:02:11,236 --> 01:02:16,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be honest, you know, it was kind of like, oh, yeah, Zelda.

784
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:21,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just sort of, you know, muscle-memorying my way through the game.

785
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:24,607
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

786
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:29,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as easy the first time as I remember, you know, at least through the first level.

787
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:31,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.

788
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:34,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good incentive for me to touch the classic.

789
01:02:35,748 --> 01:02:42,112
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's move on and talk about that part of Nintendo that Loki loves to talk about, the legal department.

790
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:45,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's litigious news with Nintendo.

791
01:02:45,694 --> 01:02:51,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so this week, you know, when they're not striking down, what was it last week?

792
01:02:51,137 --> 01:02:52,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember now.

793
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:53,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see.

794
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,560
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gone after go-karting companies.

795
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,660
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gone after

796
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:00,302
[SPEAKER_04]: fan games.

797
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:16,206
[SPEAKER_04]: This now is 3D model content that's been put into Garry's Mod by people, you know, because there's lots of user-generated content in Garry's Mod and people use that to do all sorts of crazy things, including make animations and whatnot.

798
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, Facepunch Studios has received a takedown notice to remove 20 years worth of Nintendo-related content from the game.

799
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:35,335
[SPEAKER_04]: They updated their Steam page with saying, Some of you may have noticed certain Nintendo-related workshop items have recently been taken down.

800
01:03:35,335 --> 01:03:36,716
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a mistake.

801
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:38,858
[SPEAKER_04]: The takedowns came from Nintendo.

802
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, this is fair enough.

803
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:45,162
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Nintendo's content, and what they allow and don't allow is up to them.

804
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:48,284
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want you playing with that stuff in Gary's mod.

805
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:49,265
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their decision.

806
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:53,088
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to respect that and take down as much as we can.

807
01:03:53,088 --> 01:03:54,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they followed that up with,

808
01:03:55,259 --> 01:04:01,184
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo-related uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot.

809
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:05,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sure they don't want to be sued by Nintendo.

810
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, to be fair, it's not really their... I mean, it's the users doing it.

811
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:13,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, Facepunch Studios and say, hey, upload all your Nintendo content to us.

812
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:17,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure that they have, like, clauses for, like, copyrighted works, but...

813
01:04:19,031 --> 01:04:20,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

814
01:04:20,352 --> 01:04:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm off the roadblocks.

815
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just interesting to me, like how old or how long this has been around.

816
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:28,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, it's one of those things is just now coming to light.

817
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:45,192
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if you if you kind of believe what was said by that, you remember the the former head of legal Nintendo was interviewed by some blog or podcast or something a few weeks ago and actually said, like, when these things show up on my desk is when we kind of learn about them, you know, or that or how things were run at the time.

818
01:04:45,192 --> 01:04:46,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that person was at the Pokemon company.

819
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:47,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

820
01:04:48,174 --> 01:04:56,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but still, like, you know, you sort of get that sense that, wow, somebody, somebody, somebody narked on this stuff to Nintendo.

821
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:58,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the, you know, cease and desist went out.

822
01:04:58,581 --> 01:05:00,642
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people didn't even believe it was real at first.

823
01:05:00,642 --> 01:05:03,564
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought somebody was actually impersonating Nintendo.

824
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:04,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first.

825
01:05:04,164 --> 01:05:07,887
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why that comment actually says it is real.

826
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:13,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from Nintendo because they had to sort of verify that it actually was from Nintendo.

827
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,591
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

828
01:05:15,351 --> 01:05:25,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, here, look, I don't mean to dig up months old drama, but at the same time, sometimes I'm a little bit messy and I live for drama.

829
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:29,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It is interesting to me because we're talking about models of Nintendo characters, right?

830
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:35,569
[SPEAKER_03]: That are like in Gary's mod or think that models that are out to resemble Nintendo characters, right?

831
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:35,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

832
01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:41,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how is POW World still operating?

833
01:05:41,056 --> 01:05:43,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's be real.

834
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: How did fucking Garry's Mod get the C&D before POW World?

835
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:56,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's a sense that it's their IP that people are creating models of.

836
01:05:56,104 --> 01:05:56,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be different.

837
01:05:56,825 --> 01:05:59,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like, well, I don't think we could draw the same comparison.

838
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:04,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, say Palworld made a really terrible version of Pikachu.

839
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:08,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they just, they tried to really make Pikachu, but they're just not really good at modeling.

840
01:06:08,493 --> 01:06:11,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it didn't quite look like Pikachu.

841
01:06:11,055 --> 01:06:14,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Palworld, it does look like Pikachu.

842
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not, not that in Pokemon specifically.

843
01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:17,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Lovett

844
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:46,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, again, I'm not anti pal world or anything before people, you know, I played the game for a hot minute.

845
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:49,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, All right, this is this isn't Pokemon.

846
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:50,178
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my thing.

847
01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is not Pokemon for adults.

848
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And the video games, media bloggers blew that way the fuck out of control.

849
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is arc survival evolved with Pokemon in it.

850
01:07:01,082 --> 01:07:02,582
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that game was.

851
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:07,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, I'd like even I look at it and I go look,

852
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:16,223
[SPEAKER_03]: These creatures in POW World are legally distinct Pokemon, and I'm not even sure they're legally distinct, to be quite honest.

853
01:07:16,223 --> 01:07:20,126
[SPEAKER_03]: They do look very much like... I traced that.

854
01:07:20,126 --> 01:07:24,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's... I don't know.

855
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:24,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

856
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:34,465
[SPEAKER_03]: MusicalDaredevil in our chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, thank you very much for the raid by the way, says, I also heard a lot of comparisons to Ark.

857
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:45,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, unfortunately that game ended up with headlines, it was like, oh yeah, it's Pokemon with guns, or it's Pokemon for adults, and it's like, neither of those things are true.

858
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:54,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon is a turn-based battle game, it's a RPG mechanic rooted, that literally doesn't exist in PAL world.

859
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:56,455
[SPEAKER_03]: not there.

860
01:07:56,455 --> 01:07:58,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a survival game.

861
01:07:58,076 --> 01:08:15,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a you know, and the the little pals, the legally distinct Pokemon question mark in that game simply they do tasks for you and you do collect them that is part of that in your interface that looks very similar to Zelda Breath of the Wild.

862
01:08:15,663 --> 01:08:23,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But somehow lays like it's almost like we're going to copy this from this game and copy this from this game.

863
01:08:23,006 --> 01:08:24,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

864
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:24,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway,

865
01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:31,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get like a 3D platforming POW World game then?

866
01:08:31,283 --> 01:08:46,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful what you, I just, again, if Nintendo lets it go by, there is going to be a POW World spinoff game that's an RPG, and then it's going to be too late, like, to stop that game from getting, because once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.

867
01:08:46,973 --> 01:08:48,133
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

868
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:51,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one thing I would like to see on the internet is a fully

869
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:57,059
[SPEAKER_03]: playable game on release day.

870
01:08:57,059 --> 01:09:00,440
[SPEAKER_03]: But Aiden Chronicle, we talked a little bit about that earlier in the game.

871
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:04,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been having some problems and it was released on the switch.

872
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:07,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a little rough when it came out.

873
01:09:07,424 --> 01:09:14,628
[SPEAKER_03]: There apparently well apparently the devs originally were saying we're not even sure we can put this on the switch, but they did pull it off.

874
01:09:14,628 --> 01:09:19,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were some glitches and bugs and those sorts of things including

875
01:09:20,471 --> 01:09:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: a patch that just came out for the game that's right a day one patch version 1.0.3 that addresses progression issues because i believe there was a character and this was on all versions actually there was a character where you couldn't uh actually recruit them if they weren't in your party at a certain time it was weird um graphic display glitches game balance adjustments refinement of localized text updated backer content game system bug fixes

876
01:09:49,111 --> 01:09:56,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall optimizations, improved stability, and then there is a upcoming 1.04 patch that's coming.

877
01:09:56,194 --> 01:10:05,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is the Lamb is the name of the ally that has somebody recruitable later in the story that apparently blocks a certain part of the game.

878
01:10:05,738 --> 01:10:10,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just basically a series of events goes a certain way, and it's irrecoverable.

879
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, it's late in the game.

880
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely have no idea who that character is, and I'm about 12 hours in, but

881
01:10:15,862 --> 01:10:18,204
[SPEAKER_03]: still one of those things is just kind of annoying.

882
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm glad to see the patches are happening.

883
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:26,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, should I just I just wait six months to play so I know I'm playing like, okay, they're really good.

884
01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:29,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can play turbo kit turbo kit instead.

885
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that game is awesome.

886
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:33,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly I'm gonna endorse that game.

887
01:10:33,373 --> 01:10:34,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not paid by them.

888
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:36,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm gonna endorse it because that game is awesome.

889
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:38,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Like seriously, go play that game.

890
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:40,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super cheap to like sub $20.

891
01:10:41,492 --> 01:10:44,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. T in chat says I heard Shane had some issues with it.

892
01:10:44,136 --> 01:10:45,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one was for him.

893
01:10:45,257 --> 01:10:47,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was experiencing some of those issues.

894
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I know, I mean, he can call in if he really wants to have a say.

895
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:52,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's listening.

896
01:10:52,105 --> 01:10:55,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I know, he's he's relatively happy with the game.

897
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But he in that camp of

898
01:11:00,137 --> 01:11:03,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I want another Suikoden on PlayStation 1.

899
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,541
[SPEAKER_03]: He got what he asked for.

900
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:08,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's again for better and for worse.

901
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So but if you're really a hardcore fan, that stuff ain't gonna bother you.

902
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So fine.

903
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

904
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:22,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on and but I know he does have it on at least two different systems.

905
01:11:22,635 --> 01:11:26,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear, because I think he backed it on PlayStation 5.

906
01:11:26,779 --> 01:11:29,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But he is playing it on Nintendo Switch.

907
01:11:29,441 --> 01:11:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So

908
01:11:30,609 --> 01:11:32,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

909
01:11:32,411 --> 01:11:35,474
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

910
01:11:35,474 --> 01:11:50,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for fans of Mega Man Legends, the second game's Japanese prologue is finally getting translated into English by a fan translation group called Hilltop Works, and they are working on this.

911
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be interesting.

912
01:11:57,652 --> 01:12:09,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are big fans of this series, of course, you might know of its Japanese name, Rockman Dash 2, Episode 2, Oninaru Isan.

913
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:18,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But the English name for the version would be Mega Man Legends 2, Episode 1, Roll's Close Call.

914
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:21,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are saying that it actually should already be live.

915
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:31,996
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find that on Hilltop's, looks like their social media.

916
01:12:31,996 --> 01:12:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

917
01:12:34,478 --> 01:12:49,251
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of, I'm surprised it kind of took this long for a fan translation, honestly, especially with how many fans there are of the Mega Man Legends series and how we're all sitting here feeling some sort of way that they never did do Mega Man Legend 3.

918
01:12:49,251 --> 01:12:50,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know,

919
01:12:50,692 --> 01:12:53,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's still really cool for fans of the series.

920
01:12:53,555 --> 01:13:02,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to see the the this kind of is along the lines of the prototype stuff where it's like, oh, this little secret from years ago gets unearthed.

921
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:05,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case, the secret is, oh, it's a part of the game.

922
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,490
[SPEAKER_03]: They just didn't even bring over in the U.S.

923
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:11,254
[SPEAKER_03]: version, like like the endings with Buster Groove, right?

924
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:11,995
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of like that.

925
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:13,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust a Move

926
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, I'm not rediscovering it because they broke it.

927
01:13:31,071 --> 01:13:32,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

928
01:13:32,392 --> 01:13:53,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, so Fallout 4, I was getting their next gen update for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and then of course PC, I play on PC and it broke the PC version, at least if you're modding it, because, um, the mod loaders and stuff for it don't work with this version of the game.

929
01:13:53,423 --> 01:13:53,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

930
01:13:54,867 --> 01:13:59,712
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual update itself is kind of minimal.

931
01:13:59,712 --> 01:14:06,718
[SPEAKER_04]: They've only patched 16 bugs in the game and updated some of the stability in it.

932
01:14:06,718 --> 01:14:12,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's the Xbox Series X and S quality mode, which you get a

933
01:14:14,369 --> 01:14:14,449
[SPEAKER_04]: and

934
01:14:25,999 --> 01:14:37,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there was an issue with folks that had gotten the game through PlayStation Plus that you weren't able to download this update.

935
01:14:37,285 --> 01:14:42,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't working, so they're working on fixing that as well.

936
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:48,152
[SPEAKER_04]: However, though, the good news is the folks behind the script extender, Ian Pat,

937
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:51,034
[SPEAKER_04]: said that they are working on an update.

938
01:14:51,034 --> 01:14:54,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, they don't know how long it's going to take to create it.

939
01:14:54,617 --> 01:14:55,998
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, I'm working on an update.

940
01:14:55,998 --> 01:15:03,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't currently offer a timeline for its availability, nor whether there will be any critical technical issues that would block an update.

941
01:15:03,723 --> 01:15:08,207
[SPEAKER_04]: If not obvious already, this one's going to take much longer than normal.

942
01:15:08,207 --> 01:15:11,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Bethesda, for breaking things.

943
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:17,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard yet what the new, like, there's supposed to be like a new questline stuff that's available in there as well, but

944
01:15:19,187 --> 01:15:23,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I dunno, I'd rather not have that and be able to play the game modded.

945
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:33,368
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster in our chat says, Fallout London, a huge and ambitious mod, was forced to delay their release because of the patch and are apparently not happy about it.

946
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:37,931
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100Matt says, just wait for the modders to fix Fallout 4 better than Bethesda will.

947
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: They already did.

948
01:15:38,892 --> 01:15:52,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's the thing, is Bethesda came in to try to fix it, like, for console players, I guess, to patch it, bring it up to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Specs, but, like, they can't be trusted to make a good game anymore.

949
01:15:52,599 --> 01:15:53,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

950
01:15:55,274 --> 01:16:00,316
[SPEAKER_04]: After Starfield, man, like I just don't trust them with any other games anymore.

951
01:16:00,316 --> 01:16:10,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, after the TV show and everything, which has been received really well, apparently the number of concurrent users playing Fallout 4 like really took off.

952
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:13,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there are a lot of people going back to the game because of the series.

953
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

954
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:18,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is not surprising, but maybe the volume is a little surprising.

955
01:16:18,682 --> 01:16:18,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

956
01:16:18,902 --> 01:16:20,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a way to like

957
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:48,975
[SPEAKER_04]: um basically unpatch the game to back to before this patch it's just a pain in the ass and i don't want to do it you just you just want a game that works is that so wrong i just want a game that works the way i want it i want it to break when i put too many mods into it like i don't want to break because bethesda's touched something on it like fifth dream does point out mods not in creation club are not officially supported so the game still works

958
01:16:50,066 --> 01:16:51,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

959
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:11,820
[SPEAKER_03]: because when you break all the mods, it's like, well, that was that was the game I enjoy, you know?

960
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I could see that.

961
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Blizzard, excuse me, not Blizzard, Bethesda doesn't have to support that stuff.

962
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:23,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also like but the fact that you can mod it so extensively is what makes the game appealing to buy for many people.

963
01:17:23,543 --> 01:17:28,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know last week on the show, Loki, you were showing off the Silent Hill mod in the background, which even I thought was pretty cool.

964
01:17:28,925 --> 01:17:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not a big Fallout person, but I was like, oh, reskinning Silent Hill might be an interesting experience, right?

965
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:37,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, so, I mean, I get it.

966
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:41,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that they, the Creation Club is great for bringing mods to console.

967
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:44,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, that's, I, you know, commend them for that.

968
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:47,592
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they weren't doing it out of the kindness of their heart.

969
01:17:47,592 --> 01:17:49,513
[SPEAKER_04]: They were doing it to sell mods to people.

970
01:17:49,513 --> 01:17:57,356
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, at the same time, like, you know, I don't really applaud them for that.

971
01:17:57,356 --> 01:17:59,857
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, like, once again, Starfield.

972
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:00,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at Starfield.

973
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they have had so much time to

974
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:32,175
[SPEAKER_04]: build a great game, and they're like, nah, we're gonna use our super old engine and still try to tack even more garbage onto it, and I'm sure that'll work, and it just, it completely was broken, and yeah, yeah, the modders will fix it, but once again, this is a game that they charged $70 for, and then some, and they want modders to fix their mistakes?

975
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,176
[SPEAKER_04]: You fix your mistakes.

976
01:18:34,093 --> 01:18:36,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortnite Festival just started season 3!

977
01:18:58,001 --> 01:18:59,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy Eilish?

978
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:01,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of the rumored leaked things.

979
01:19:01,923 --> 01:19:05,825
[SPEAKER_03]: William Eilash has actually landed.

980
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Season three has started.

981
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:09,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's something available to you.

982
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some songs that go with it as well.

983
01:19:11,989 --> 01:19:14,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?

984
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:19,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the plastic rock band stuff is now available as well.

985
01:19:19,513 --> 01:19:20,974
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

986
01:19:20,974 --> 01:19:24,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortnite Festival now supports rock band 4 controllers.

987
01:19:25,436 --> 01:19:28,097
[SPEAKER_03]: on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

988
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:36,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a Rock Band 4 plastic guitar, you can use it to play pro lead and pro bass tracks for any jam track.

989
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:43,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, it actually also changes the lanes to have the colored notes like it had in Rock Band.

990
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a neat little quality of life thing that I don't think was teased originally.

991
01:19:48,341 --> 01:19:54,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, hammer-on and pull-off notes, just like you saw in the original Rock Band and Guitar Hero, are also

992
01:19:55,123 --> 01:20:03,728
[SPEAKER_03]: available that is so they really they really went out of their way to make this game Rock Band 5 which I think is very interesting.

993
01:20:03,728 --> 01:20:11,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So um, I believe those third party controllers are showing up as well because I want to say somebody I knew got one, which is interesting.

994
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:22,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, by the way, on a weird related note about Fortnite, Epic added a setting that allows players to hide certain emotes that people use for trolling.

995
01:20:22,338 --> 01:20:35,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes when people get eliminated, a player could then do an emote that's like take the loss, which is like doing the L on the forehead, like LOL, you know, loser or whatever, LOL, and does a little dance when they do it.

996
01:20:35,128 --> 01:20:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you have that setting, you won't see it.

997
01:20:39,557 --> 01:20:39,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragequit

998
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth Dream says, do they charge for songs?

999
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:04,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

1000
01:21:04,347 --> 01:21:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is not cheap, unfortunately.

1001
01:21:06,288 --> 01:21:10,851
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they do is they have a rotating library of free songs.

1002
01:21:10,851 --> 01:21:13,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And at four o'clock Pacific, I think is still the time.

1003
01:21:13,613 --> 01:21:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that changed to five with the time zone change, but it it rotates every day Fifth Dream, the selection of free tracks.

1004
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you kind of visit once a day, you have 10 or so tracks that you can pick from.

1005
01:21:30,865 --> 01:21:33,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1006
01:21:33,829 --> 01:21:39,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to a segment from a time from before even rock band.

1007
01:21:39,438 --> 01:21:39,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's roll the bumper.

1008
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:58,466
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1009
01:21:58,466 --> 01:22:02,089
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1010
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:06,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game this week?

1011
01:22:06,092 --> 01:22:08,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked Scud Race.

1012
01:22:08,775 --> 01:22:10,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever hear of it?

1013
01:22:10,396 --> 01:22:12,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think so, actually.

1014
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:19,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Scud Race is an arcade racing game done by Sega, was released in 1996.

1015
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, I think I heard about it from you.

1016
01:22:24,828 --> 01:22:25,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1017
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:31,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my train of thought.

1018
01:22:31,723 --> 01:22:43,734
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first racing game that was released on the Sega Model 3 hardware and it never did come out on Saturn.

1019
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:51,821
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Dreamcast port announced and there was a tech demo for it on Dreamcast but it didn't come out which is sad face.

1020
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:59,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Scud Race had two arcade cabinets.

1021
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:05,505
[SPEAKER_01]: One was the twin or the deluxe cabinet that you could link up for up to eight players.

1022
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:15,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It was modeled after the BPR Global GT series that featured four different cards that were used in the 1996 season.

1023
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:34,446
[SPEAKER_01]: It had different courses of different difficulty, from beginner, with a daytime and nighttime, all the way up through an expert one, and you could put the game into Grand Prix or Endurance mode for longer races.

1024
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:47,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a thought that the demo of this that came out on Dreamcast turned into the Sega GT series.

1025
01:23:47,929 --> 01:24:03,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the, uh, four Scud Race tracks are actually unlockable on the Xbox version of OutRun 2, uh, rearranged as a whole OutRun route instead of just the individual laps.

1026
01:24:03,373 --> 01:24:07,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, at any rate, um,

1027
01:24:11,095 --> 01:24:20,818
[SPEAKER_01]: The opponent's cars, though, except for the ones that you can select on the main screen, are all Renault Alpine GTA A610s.

1028
01:24:20,818 --> 01:24:29,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, moving into a little bit of the development, they really wanted an Etona sequel.

1029
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:36,603
[SPEAKER_01]: The director, Nagoshi Toshihiro, he was like, he had the same team,

1030
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:47,386
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought they were working on the Daytona sequel, but it ended up having a different look and went in a different direction.

1031
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:58,033
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an arcade test game called Supercar, and that turned into Scud Race, aka Super GT, as we had it in the U.S.

1032
01:24:58,033 --> 01:25:04,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Notable similarities is that, you know, they all had, like, similar HUD, and

1033
01:25:05,629 --> 01:25:19,474
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that it handled in general, but that there was a drifting acceleration added in, so your drifting was a little bit different in the game.

1034
01:25:19,474 --> 01:25:30,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And Yu Suzuki, who we know as the head of AM2, also had advice to give, so he's contributed to the game a little bit too, and the cabinet design was a Sega AM4.

1035
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:45,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So they originally planned for this to be the first Model 3 game, but Virtua Fighter 3 came out before it.

1036
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was the first racing game put out on there.

1037
01:25:49,575 --> 01:25:59,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And to make sure that they had the cars accurately done in game, the development team got to race the four cars that were used in the game.

1038
01:26:02,598 --> 01:26:12,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was debuted on January 21st, 1987 at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London.

1039
01:26:12,483 --> 01:26:19,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they actually did unveil Daytona USA 2.

1040
01:26:19,026 --> 01:26:21,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the true sequel, of course, to Daytona.

1041
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:34,859
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Scud Race had its location test in Irvine, Irvine, California at the Sega City Arcade in 1987 before it had a rest of the American release.

1042
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:39,143
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, it was released as Super GT in North America because the word Scud

1043
01:26:40,204 --> 01:26:49,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had people thinking of the Scud missiles used in the Gulf War.

1044
01:26:49,847 --> 01:26:55,108
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Scud Race Plus.

1045
01:26:55,108 --> 01:26:59,650
[SPEAKER_01]: The version would allow you to play any of the four courses in reverse.

1046
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:06,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a super beginner mode that had an oval track inside a giant play room, playhouse.

1047
01:27:06,616 --> 01:27:10,079
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be a rocking horse and bowling pin.

1048
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:14,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could hit bowling pins.

1049
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:17,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could also I think you could play as a cat.

1050
01:27:17,947 --> 01:27:20,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can race as a cat, a tank.

1051
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:21,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yes.

1052
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:27,068
[SPEAKER_01]: The AM2 crew, apparently the cat didn't have the drift mechanic or something.

1053
01:27:27,068 --> 01:27:29,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I remembered watching something about it.

1054
01:27:29,309 --> 01:27:31,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could be a rocket car.

1055
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:39,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's an attract mode there where there's a red sports car going through an Italian village and destroys the Coliseum.

1056
01:27:39,117 --> 01:27:46,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, uh, background is a giant, uh, wheel that is blue, uh, instead of yellow orange.

1057
01:27:46,782 --> 01:27:49,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and of course there was no American release of Scud Race Plus.

1058
01:27:50,625 --> 01:28:00,670
[SPEAKER_01]: They never marketed this version outside of Japan, but there is a switch to switch it to USA, and the title turns to SEGA Super GT Plus.

1059
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:04,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It has basically everything from Scud Race Plus.

1060
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:12,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember what the cars... I don't see it listing what the cars, but I know that one of them is a Porsche 911.

1061
01:28:12,515 --> 01:28:13,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me double check real quick.

1062
01:28:13,996 --> 01:28:15,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Cars in Scud Race.

1063
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:16,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1064
01:28:16,377 --> 01:28:18,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in this YouTube clip somewhere, too.

1065
01:28:19,178 --> 01:28:22,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I figured I'd say them anyway.

1066
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:22,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1067
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:25,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I was right about the Porsche 911 GT2.

1068
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:31,628
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a McLaren F1 GTR, which by the way, I've gotten to drive one, just saying.

1069
01:28:31,628 --> 01:28:39,935
[SPEAKER_01]: A Ferrari F40 GTE and a Chrysler Viper GTS-R.

1070
01:28:39,935 --> 01:28:48,222
[SPEAKER_01]: The unplayable vehicles was the Alpine A610 and the 87 Lamborghini Countach.

1071
01:28:49,383 --> 01:29:01,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So your, uh, your areas that you could play was, uh, for a beginner, you had, uh, Salinas in Monterey, California.

1072
01:29:01,206 --> 01:29:02,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the Dolphin Tunnel.

1073
01:29:02,507 --> 01:29:06,828
[SPEAKER_01]: You had Niagara Falls, Ontario for a medium.

1074
01:29:06,828 --> 01:29:11,409
[SPEAKER_01]: You had, uh, Narita International Airport for, uh, Japan.

1075
01:29:11,409 --> 01:29:13,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually was a beginner and, uh,

1076
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:16,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Midna, knock it off!

1077
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:51,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It was rated by Game Machine as the second most successful dedicated arcade game of the month for March 1st, 1997.

1078
01:29:51,664 --> 01:29:52,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Very positive reviews.

1079
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:16,264
[SPEAKER_01]: It, a few places, gave it like 4 out of 5 and 5 out of 5.

1080
01:30:16,264 --> 01:30:19,026
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, very, very high ranked.

1081
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:23,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'd like to read this quote by Next Generation.

1082
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:28,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Sega's newest Model 3 creation is the most gorgeous driving game ever to grace an arcade.

1083
01:30:28,753 --> 01:30:37,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply put, Sega's Super GT is a visual masterpiece boasting never-before-seen graphics and providing realistic driving speeds gamers simply have never experienced.

1084
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless, of course, they're Mario and Ready.

1085
01:30:41,994 --> 01:30:42,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

1086
01:30:42,634 --> 01:30:43,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

1087
01:30:43,435 --> 01:30:43,655
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1088
01:30:43,655 --> 01:30:44,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Good race.

1089
01:30:44,535 --> 01:30:45,095
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1090
01:30:45,095 --> 01:30:46,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Scud Race, Classic Game of the Week.

1091
01:30:46,476 --> 01:30:50,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But over here, it was called Super GT Race.

1092
01:30:50,837 --> 01:30:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe that's how I learned about it.

1093
01:30:54,558 --> 01:30:55,439
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I learned about it.

1094
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:56,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably called it that name.

1095
01:30:56,859 --> 01:30:58,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie was like, Oh, you mean this?

1096
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean Scud Race?

1097
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:02,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1098
01:31:02,141 --> 01:31:07,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have seen a Scud Race in the wild, but

1099
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:13,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so long ago.

1100
01:31:13,953 --> 01:31:14,754
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I want to see.

1101
01:31:14,754 --> 01:31:18,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like one of the golf lands had it, I swear.

1102
01:31:18,015 --> 01:31:19,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that back.

1103
01:31:19,236 --> 01:31:25,039
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one at, there was one at Tilt, I think, in Dothan, Alabama.

1104
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:29,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to order the GT kit for it or something.

1105
01:31:29,962 --> 01:31:33,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they got it through some way.

1106
01:31:33,683 --> 01:31:34,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

1107
01:31:34,464 --> 01:31:34,704
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1108
01:31:35,612 --> 01:31:42,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's travel around and check out some other news pretty quickly on what is happening in the industry in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

1109
01:31:42,728 --> 01:31:43,290
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to Loki.

1110
01:31:44,429 --> 01:31:46,911
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about game preservation.

1111
01:31:46,911 --> 01:31:52,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Capcom is taking down three titles from the Steam Marketplace.

1112
01:31:52,275 --> 01:31:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Void, Dark Void Zero, and Flock.

1113
01:31:55,618 --> 01:31:57,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't give a reason why.

1114
01:31:57,339 --> 01:32:06,286
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just discontinuing sales of these titles May 8th at 5.30pm Pacific Daylight Time.

1115
01:32:06,286 --> 01:32:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Customers who purchased the title prior to the delisting date may still be able to enjoy these games in the future.

1116
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on their PC's operating system's ability to continue to run these games.

1117
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:19,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, thanks.

1118
01:32:19,652 --> 01:32:21,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Game preservation is important.

1119
01:32:21,272 --> 01:32:22,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1120
01:32:22,452 --> 01:32:37,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Also important and a thing that made me upset is that, you know, we never did get Grand Theft Auto V single-player DLC, like expansions, because the Grand Theft Auto IV expansions were fantastic, and I really wish that there was more of that.

1121
01:32:37,275 --> 01:32:39,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently there was actually supposed to be

1122
01:32:40,356 --> 01:32:42,578
[SPEAKER_04]: single player expansions.

1123
01:32:42,578 --> 01:32:47,203
[SPEAKER_04]: We know this based off of comments made by the voice actors.

1124
01:32:47,203 --> 01:32:56,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Steven Og, who did the voice and motion capture for Trevor on a recent podcast with Streamily.

1125
01:32:56,413 --> 01:33:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we're talking about some of the unreleased DLC for Grand Theft Auto V. One of those would have been

1126
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Agent Trevor, which had his character Trevor Phillips playing an undercover officer working for the Feds and kind of doing some sort of like, you know, James Bond-ish type stuff along with that because Trevor Phillips is kind of a, you know, insane, drug-addicted, crazy person in the game.

1127
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:31,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was quite a fish out of water scenario that

1128
01:33:36,315 --> 01:33:37,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, something weird has happened.

1129
01:33:37,515 --> 01:33:38,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost Loki.

1130
01:33:38,636 --> 01:33:40,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, do I still have you?

1131
01:33:40,216 --> 01:33:40,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1132
01:33:40,456 --> 01:33:41,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1133
01:33:41,136 --> 01:33:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we had a weird hiccup there on discord.

1134
01:33:43,077 --> 01:33:44,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, thank you discord.

1135
01:33:44,637 --> 01:33:45,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.

1136
01:33:45,677 --> 01:33:47,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I still heard Loki the whole time.

1137
01:33:47,518 --> 01:33:49,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then it was probably a hiccup on my end.

1138
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:50,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, weird.

1139
01:33:50,518 --> 01:33:56,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually that's like the first internet glitch we've had since like a year or so.

1140
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki, you just froze there at the end.

1141
01:33:58,638 --> 01:34:00,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see.

1142
01:34:00,679 --> 01:34:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, they were planning on having DLC for all of the three games protagonists, but you know, Grand Theft Auto 9 was a thing and they made so much money that they're like, money, and they forget it.

1143
01:34:15,785 --> 01:34:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1144
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on and DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1145
01:34:22,387 --> 01:34:31,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is some DLC coming out for River City Girls 2, and it is River City Girls 2 Cross Double Dragon.

1146
01:34:31,475 --> 01:34:38,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will get Billy and Jimmy Lee in the game, and they're going to go around and kick some ass.

1147
01:34:38,901 --> 01:34:40,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's voice acting.

1148
01:34:40,923 --> 01:34:41,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

1149
01:34:41,884 --> 01:34:42,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1150
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:46,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Switch Online Service

1151
01:35:04,938 --> 01:35:07,319
[SPEAKER_03]: and Iggy's Wrecking Balls.

1152
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:09,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, those are the games.

1153
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:19,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I vaguely remember Xtreme G. I think I did see because I remember it looks like Tron Bikes, like it's what they're not, except they look like actual motorcycles, but they're kind of shaped like Tron Bikes.

1154
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:20,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that.

1155
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:22,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a motorcycle racing game.

1156
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:24,143
[SPEAKER_03]: But then Iggy's Wrecking Balls.

1157
01:35:24,143 --> 01:35:29,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally have never heard of this game, which looks like maybe like a monkey ball kind of game for Nintendo 64.

1158
01:35:30,543 --> 01:35:35,569
[SPEAKER_03]: travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out in a store near you.

1159
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:36,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with the US, Loki.

1160
01:35:48,004 --> 01:35:49,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot this week.

1161
01:35:49,305 --> 01:35:58,249
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Braid Anniversary Edition on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, iOS, and Android.

1162
01:35:58,249 --> 01:36:01,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea of Thieves on PlayStation 5.

1163
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:04,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Endless Ocean, Luminous on Nintendo Switch.

1164
01:36:04,991 --> 01:36:09,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's... I forgot that was a thing coming out.

1165
01:36:09,313 --> 01:36:17,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Toho, Mystica's... Izakaya on Nintendo Switch.

1166
01:36:19,102 --> 01:36:20,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Izakaya?

1167
01:36:20,884 --> 01:36:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Izakaya.

1168
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:22,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1169
01:36:22,907 --> 01:36:28,154
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a like going to get drinks and snacks after work kind of place.

1170
01:36:28,154 --> 01:36:31,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is a restaurant simulation, so... There you go.

1171
01:36:31,698 --> 01:36:31,979
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1172
01:36:32,805 --> 01:36:33,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1173
01:36:33,485 --> 01:36:41,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, going to Japanese releases, here's the thing is that, you know, there's that one week a year where I go, huh, it seems like there's nothing coming out in Japan.

1174
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:42,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Golden Week?

1175
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:43,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is yes.

1176
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

1177
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Golden Week.

1178
01:36:45,071 --> 01:36:45,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Golden Week!

1179
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:50,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And that probably explains Happy Golden Week to anyone in Japan who's listening.

1180
01:36:50,074 --> 01:36:52,835
[SPEAKER_03]: But that explains probably why it's a little slower.

1181
01:36:52,835 --> 01:36:54,176
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's actually not empty.

1182
01:36:54,176 --> 01:36:55,657
[SPEAKER_03]: The calendar in Japan is not empty.

1183
01:36:55,657 --> 01:36:59,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I think because we have more worldwide releases now, and especially with digital,

1184
01:36:59,779 --> 01:37:05,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So that same Izakaya game you were just talking about is releasing in Japan as well on May 2nd.

1185
01:37:05,081 --> 01:37:06,121
[SPEAKER_03]: However, guess what?

1186
01:37:06,121 --> 01:37:09,182
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a regular and a limited edition.

1187
01:37:09,182 --> 01:37:11,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of course there are.

1188
01:37:11,063 --> 01:37:15,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you get some little cards in the limited edition, some stickers maybe.

1189
01:37:15,564 --> 01:37:17,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like, let's, can I be completely right?

1190
01:37:17,805 --> 01:37:21,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a bunch of crap, but that's usually what comes with the limited edition is a bunch of crap.

1191
01:37:22,526 --> 01:37:22,826
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura UK

1192
01:37:47,762 --> 01:37:50,803
[SPEAKER_01]: For the UK, just a handful.

1193
01:37:50,803 --> 01:37:55,165
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 2nd, we have MotoGP 24th for the big three.

1194
01:37:55,165 --> 01:37:59,547
[SPEAKER_01]: On Switch, we have Endless Ocean Luminous.

1195
01:37:59,547 --> 01:38:06,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on the third on PlayStation and Switch, we have Mike Magnolia's Hellboy Web of Weird.

1196
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:11,292
[SPEAKER_01]: For PlayStation, Xbox, and computer, we have House Flipper 2.

1197
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,609
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1198
01:38:15,609 --> 01:38:17,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's it for the release dates.

1199
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do just a couple more stories.

1200
01:38:19,192 --> 01:38:22,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll see if any of you want to participate with the roundtable.

1201
01:38:22,334 --> 01:38:26,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We always accept your emails participate at orange on trader.com.

1202
01:38:26,316 --> 01:38:34,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll check out and see if anybody wants to call as well in our green room on our discord server, which by the way, you don't just have to use the discord server for calling us.

1203
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also leave us messages throughout the week.

1204
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a pretty active chat channel there.

1205
01:38:39,981 --> 01:38:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise we keep the pings to a minimum.

1206
01:38:42,163 --> 01:38:44,884
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I almost want to say that it's non existent.

1207
01:38:44,884 --> 01:38:46,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the last time we ever did an everyone ping.

1208
01:38:46,826 --> 01:38:48,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it actually happens there.

1209
01:38:48,907 --> 01:38:54,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do it does inform you of new VOG Network content in the channels without a ping.

1210
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,812
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever want to stay on top of what's happening around the network.

1211
01:38:56,812 --> 01:39:01,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, vognetwork.com slash discord is the place to get on our discord server.

1212
01:39:01,855 --> 01:39:04,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to a couple other last stories here, Loki.

1213
01:39:05,578 --> 01:39:12,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Valve has apparently closed a loophole in their Steam refund policy.

1214
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:23,711
[SPEAKER_04]: The way people were explaining it is games that had advanced access, which is essentially playtime that's prior to the game's release, so think of like...

1215
01:39:24,636 --> 01:39:26,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in this case, it would have been a positive.

1216
01:39:26,697 --> 01:39:32,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, let's think about like Suicide Squad, where if I paid a little extra money, I get to play it three days early.

1217
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:39,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently some people were buying games with that advanced access, beating said game within that time period.

1218
01:39:39,582 --> 01:39:50,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because Valve didn't start the clock until release day, they were able to go ahead and refund the title before that.

1219
01:39:50,147 --> 01:39:51,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It took them that long to fix that?

1220
01:39:51,948 --> 01:39:52,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

1221
01:39:54,116 --> 01:39:55,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm surprised.

1222
01:39:55,116 --> 01:40:03,119
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, now, now it's essentially going to be I think, yeah, now it's that purchase time instead of, you know, the release date.

1223
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:09,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's probably a small subset of people that were doing that.

1224
01:40:09,002 --> 01:40:12,743
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, at least they've kind of fixed that.

1225
01:40:12,743 --> 01:40:17,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's a way people can be shitty, count on it.

1226
01:40:17,145 --> 01:40:18,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1227
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:19,206
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1228
01:40:19,206 --> 01:40:19,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Such is life.

1229
01:40:20,752 --> 01:40:25,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, this goes to gaming corporations as well, because I don't know about this one.

1230
01:40:25,215 --> 01:40:26,295
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty wild.

1231
01:40:26,295 --> 01:40:35,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a game and I, I actually, yes, I don't know this game, Loki, you might have to fill me in on what this is all about, because it looks like a shooty shooty bang bang game.

1232
01:40:35,961 --> 01:40:38,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a game called Escape from Tarkov.

1233
01:40:39,788 --> 01:40:46,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a so escape from Tarkov is a what they call it an extraction shooter.

1234
01:40:46,595 --> 01:41:03,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, what you're doing is you're entering into like a giant war zone map or whatever, and you have to go get valuable assets or things from the map and then escape out of the map you need to extract yourself before being killed by someone else which

1235
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:07,614
[SPEAKER_03]: ToBeFair was kind of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode, which I fucking loved.

1236
01:41:07,614 --> 01:41:10,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so, you know, I like the extraction games.

1237
01:41:10,076 --> 01:41:10,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1238
01:41:10,577 --> 01:41:12,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem with that.

1239
01:41:12,038 --> 01:41:14,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do have a problem with some things I'm hearing about this.

1240
01:41:14,681 --> 01:41:21,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's so this game has been in beta for six years, which I didn't realize it's been a beta a very long time.

1241
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:26,312
[SPEAKER_03]: But now they're getting closer and closer to release and they are going to be releasing the game in different tiers.

1242
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:30,216
[SPEAKER_03]: which usually have I know we joke about the collectors editions in Japan.

1243
01:41:30,216 --> 01:41:34,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just because they do all sorts of shitty digital collectors editions here.

1244
01:41:34,241 --> 01:41:35,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And this game is no different.

1245
01:41:35,443 --> 01:41:39,728
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be the unheard edition of this game $250 for this game.

1246
01:41:43,410 --> 01:41:56,798
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there is content in this $250 version that is not in the $120 version of the game, which promised free access to all subsequent DLCs or Season Pass.

1247
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:04,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a persistent PVE mode, which I'm going to assume means the extraction never happens.

1248
01:42:04,506 --> 01:42:06,766
[SPEAKER_03]: You just keep going and going, going till you can't anymore.

1249
01:42:06,766 --> 01:42:08,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually what persistent, I think.

1250
01:42:08,126 --> 01:42:08,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1251
01:42:08,807 --> 01:42:13,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that could mean a lot of things, but there is a new mode called persistent PVE mode.

1252
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:18,829
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot get it in the $120 version, even though they promised all the DLC and that.

1253
01:42:19,948 --> 01:42:37,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an offline type of thing, so you're playing against AI enemies, and you can also bring your friends in as well, and apparently you can use your pre-level character, and you get other perks that's kind of more pay-to-win as well with it.

1254
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:43,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but yeah, it really comes down to the people that dropped $120 for a game that's not finished yet, and then they're like,

1255
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:54,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, we want you to pay $250 to get this, but they're like, but hey, you know, well, is there a battle pass in this too?

1256
01:42:54,307 --> 01:42:59,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're talking about pay to win elements, pre leveled player skills.

1257
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:02,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds really nickel and dime in the audience.

1258
01:43:02,393 --> 01:43:04,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're gonna discount to 30 bucks.

1259
01:43:04,235 --> 01:43:06,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So you only have to pay an extra $100 to upgrade if you want.

1260
01:43:06,636 --> 01:43:07,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Lord.

1261
01:43:08,346 --> 01:43:10,808
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1262
01:43:26,806 --> 01:43:32,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 2016, players have supported the developers by purchasing the highest edition of the game.

1263
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:37,935
[SPEAKER_03]: For eight years, we've been recommending this game to friends, bringing more and more players into the community.

1264
01:43:37,935 --> 01:43:39,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the developers' response?

1265
01:43:39,856 --> 01:43:46,822
[SPEAKER_03]: They've blown us off, refused to comment, and only encouraged those who have lost all respect for themselves and continue to pour money in.

1266
01:43:47,242 --> 01:43:49,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally had high hopes for Tarkov.

1267
01:43:49,082 --> 01:43:53,243
[SPEAKER_03]: In my eyes, it was a high quality and most ambitious product on the entire market.

1268
01:43:53,243 --> 01:43:54,744
[SPEAKER_03]: This is unacceptable.

1269
01:43:54,744 --> 01:43:55,944
[SPEAKER_03]: This is selfish.

1270
01:43:55,944 --> 01:43:57,484
[SPEAKER_03]: This is disrespectful.

1271
01:43:57,484 --> 01:43:59,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You've disgraced yourselves completely.

1272
01:43:59,384 --> 01:44:01,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You've lost loyal players.

1273
01:44:01,545 --> 01:44:03,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You've betrayed the idea.

1274
01:44:03,005 --> 01:44:06,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disgusting to everyone who feels the same way.

1275
01:44:06,306 --> 01:44:07,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be silent.

1276
01:44:07,306 --> 01:44:08,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Spam.

1277
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:09,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Make memes.

1278
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:10,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Spread the word.

1279
01:44:10,527 --> 01:44:12,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Do dramatic readings on podcasts.

1280
01:44:12,427 --> 01:44:13,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I added that.

1281
01:44:13,787 --> 01:44:16,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever it's relevant, this cannot be tolerated.

1282
01:44:18,109 --> 01:44:22,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So damn, people are pissed, yo.

1283
01:44:22,332 --> 01:44:25,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's something to take for the but I get of course they are.

1284
01:44:25,434 --> 01:44:27,115
[SPEAKER_03]: They have every right to be to be quite honest.

1285
01:44:28,186 --> 01:44:34,011
[SPEAKER_03]: When fans support a game only to have the developer do this shit is really gross.

1286
01:44:34,011 --> 01:44:48,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand developers have to get paid, but I also understand the planning should be there to be able to make that happen successfully without withholding modes from people who were under the reasonable assumption that they were buying the full version of the game.

1287
01:44:48,404 --> 01:44:48,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

1288
01:44:51,445 --> 01:44:57,547
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster points out BSG first tried to say that the PVE mode wasn't DLC, even though it sounds exactly like DLC.

1289
01:44:57,547 --> 01:44:59,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DLC.

1290
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to make it legally distinct because now this is smelling like a class action lawsuit.

1291
01:45:05,429 --> 01:45:13,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've walked stuff back too, obviously, because they're in panic, you know, put out fire mode, but they've walked it back.

1292
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:15,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like, for example, PVE access, they said.

1293
01:45:16,112 --> 01:45:21,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just decided to open it up to EOD owners for free, but we'll do it in waves.

1294
01:45:21,715 --> 01:45:24,737
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said before, we don't have server capacity right now.

1295
01:45:24,737 --> 01:45:26,778
[SPEAKER_04]: We will start the process as soon as possible.

1296
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:32,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We also decided that we'll add mod support for PVE mode after the release of the game.

1297
01:45:32,581 --> 01:45:35,343
[SPEAKER_04]: About Unheard Edition, we will not remove it.

1298
01:45:35,343 --> 01:45:43,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to keep the option for those who want to support the game more, but we will balance items, perks into this edition as we provide more rewards for those, blah, blah, blah.

1299
01:45:46,368 --> 01:45:53,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see here, I was trying to see what the responses of some of the stuff.

1300
01:45:53,856 --> 01:45:57,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, none of it's really informative.

1301
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1302
01:45:58,462 --> 01:46:00,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there you go.

1303
01:46:00,464 --> 01:46:04,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like it was a game that was on my radar anyway, and now it's really not on my radar.

1304
01:46:04,288 --> 01:46:05,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So congrats on that one, folks.

1305
01:46:06,801 --> 01:46:18,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's what that's what a lot of people that have been saying, especially like those folks that were considering streaming on like their their communities and saying, Hey, why don't you stream on Tarkov or whatever?

1306
01:46:18,411 --> 01:46:21,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now they see this like, Nope, not anymore.

1307
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:23,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Not touching that one.

1308
01:46:23,415 --> 01:46:24,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1309
01:46:24,076 --> 01:46:31,662
[SPEAKER_03]: How a bad boardroom decision can tank your entire fucking game in six easy steps, or even one easy step to be quite honest.

1310
01:46:33,092 --> 01:46:34,553
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1311
01:46:34,553 --> 01:46:36,214
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, we get to the Lister Roundtable.

1312
01:46:36,214 --> 01:46:41,176
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have any questions for us, we'd love to see them in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1313
01:46:41,176 --> 01:46:43,137
[SPEAKER_03]: We do always take a moment to check the mailbag.

1314
01:46:43,137 --> 01:46:45,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's empty this week, but let me verify that with DarkSakura.

1315
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:45,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

1316
01:46:45,639 --> 01:46:46,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full of crickets.

1317
01:46:46,659 --> 01:46:47,220
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1318
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to, you know, help dust off the mailbag because it's getting a little stanky with the lack of emails.

1319
01:46:55,864 --> 01:47:00,627
[SPEAKER_03]: At least we had a couple for our thousandth episode, but I guess I guess those are the last emails we're ever going to get.

1320
01:47:00,627 --> 01:47:02,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

1321
01:47:03,188 --> 01:47:06,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let me check in with I don't see anyone in our green room either.

1322
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:07,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1323
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,191
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap up soon.

1324
01:47:08,191 --> 01:47:11,272
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me check with Loki here and see if there's any last minute stories you want to get to.

1325
01:47:11,272 --> 01:47:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say that there was a brand new fan game released for it's a Sonic fan game, actually.

1326
01:47:20,216 --> 01:47:23,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers.

1327
01:47:23,237 --> 01:47:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fan made, I guess, SRB to Ring Racer with 200 plus tracks.

1328
01:47:32,061 --> 01:47:40,305
[SPEAKER_04]: and local split-screen multiplayer, online play for up to 16 players, a whole bunch of mechanics and stuff like that.

1329
01:47:40,305 --> 01:47:48,928
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to KartCrew, both with K's, .org and download it for free.

1330
01:47:48,928 --> 01:47:53,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks, it's like a quasi, like, it's like a combination between, like,

1331
01:47:55,376 --> 01:48:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart because it's got 2D sprites, but it's a 3D map.

1332
01:48:01,099 --> 01:48:02,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of interesting.

1333
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:04,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious about this because it looks kind of interesting.

1334
01:48:04,341 --> 01:48:04,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they do.

1335
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:06,682
[SPEAKER_03]: They do link to a trailer here.

1336
01:48:06,682 --> 01:48:08,483
[SPEAKER_03]: That's obviously.

1337
01:48:08,483 --> 01:48:10,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they did that like in the style of an old.

1338
01:48:10,324 --> 01:48:13,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know if I like that.

1339
01:48:13,226 --> 01:48:16,568
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of did the old style with it, but OK.

1340
01:48:16,568 --> 01:48:18,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what the game looks like.

1341
01:48:18,068 --> 01:48:20,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not that blurry, but it's like that.

1342
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:20,950
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1343
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:21,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1344
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:24,312
[SPEAKER_03]: But the blurry is is a choice, but that's all right.

1345
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1346
01:48:26,347 --> 01:48:27,908
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for a fan product.

1347
01:48:27,908 --> 01:48:29,190
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still very impressive.

1348
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:29,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1349
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:31,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1350
01:48:31,892 --> 01:48:36,977
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, using that effect on your trailer, that's a choice, my friends.

1351
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:38,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that was a good idea.

1352
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,902
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1353
01:48:41,902 --> 01:48:43,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Loki?

1354
01:48:43,444 --> 01:48:44,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1355
01:48:44,225 --> 01:48:45,306
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1356
01:48:45,306 --> 01:48:48,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap it up.

1357
01:48:49,016 --> 01:48:52,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all so much for being here tonight and participating with the show.

1358
01:48:52,560 --> 01:49:00,988
[SPEAKER_03]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1359
01:49:00,988 --> 01:49:02,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Spread the word.

1360
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:02,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell friends.

1361
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:09,577
[SPEAKER_03]: A five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show goes an awful long way as well.

1362
01:49:09,577 --> 01:49:11,519
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate that.

1363
01:49:11,519 --> 01:49:12,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so

1364
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,541
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in seven days to do it all again, but let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1365
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:20,663
[SPEAKER_03]: First, DarkSakura, I'm sure you're going to be streaming after the show tonight.

1366
01:49:20,663 --> 01:49:22,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1367
01:49:22,984 --> 01:49:25,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I need a nap.

1368
01:49:25,764 --> 01:49:26,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen to that.

1369
01:49:26,785 --> 01:49:27,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out.

1370
01:49:27,405 --> 01:49:27,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1371
01:49:27,905 --> 01:49:28,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't nap yet.

1372
01:49:28,665 --> 01:49:30,266
[SPEAKER_03]: You got streaming to do.

1373
01:49:30,266 --> 01:49:31,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1374
01:49:31,666 --> 01:49:33,607
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not not for not terribly long.

1375
01:49:33,607 --> 01:49:35,748
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go around and smack some people around.

1376
01:49:35,748 --> 01:49:36,308
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1377
01:49:36,308 --> 01:49:36,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like fun.

1378
01:49:36,888 --> 01:49:37,488
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1379
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:38,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1380
01:49:38,749 --> 01:49:39,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.

1381
01:49:39,454 --> 01:49:41,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1382
01:49:50,934 --> 01:49:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my final thought is I'm riding a high from the show I hosted here locally last night.

1383
01:49:56,379 --> 01:50:03,465
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time and always thankful to the Scream Queens Gorlesks here in Sacramento for having me.

1384
01:50:03,465 --> 01:50:04,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a really good time.

1385
01:50:04,486 --> 01:50:15,997
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some awesome guest performers, which from the television show Dragula, which is like it's like Drag Race, but spooky and very, very well done in the art direction department.

1386
01:50:16,437 --> 01:50:17,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigourney Beaver Onyx on Dicks

1387
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to be a part of that.

1388
01:50:34,521 --> 01:50:39,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, and if you want to see more of my in person appearances, Instagram is honestly the best place.

1389
01:50:39,924 --> 01:50:44,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I promote that all the time on Instagram, Mr. Rob Roberts, Mr. Rob Roberts.

1390
01:50:44,006 --> 01:50:47,228

1391
