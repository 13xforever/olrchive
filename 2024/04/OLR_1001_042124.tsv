9753	14857	According to IMDB, Keanu Reeves is most known for Neo, Jack Traven, Johnny Utah, and Neo.
14857	15578	Two Neos?
15578	16178	No Ted?
16178	17680	No John Wick?
17680	22123	Surely one of those two Neos will be replaced by his new starring role, Shadow the Hedgehog.
22123	28429	Add to his roles a roller-skating gun-toting edgelord hedgehog, or maybe something slightly different in the next installment of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies.
28429	30010	This is the Games and Hollywood Update.
30010	34674	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and news of games themselves.
34674	36876	Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice,
39755	42637	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42637	47799	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47799	60366	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight, April the 21st of 2024 with episode number 1001 of our show.
60366	64328	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week along with my co-hosts.
64328	67990	First off, say hello to the wonderful DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69136	71158	I had so much fun.
83496	83976	Drew, Dead By Daylight
100675	102696	And he seemed to really enjoy it.
102696	103977	Oh, that's cool.
103977	109140	The first game was a very silly match, so I'm glad that that was his first game.
109140	117424	And then my friend KVKingdom, who I've known for a while too, played DBD with us last night as well.
117424	119085	That was the one that was joining us as I was leaving, right?
124989	140380	Smokey played off and on with me during the day and I did some killer but mostly it was just really fun survivor time and we had some very silly matches and I finally got the one thing I wanted to happen to happen and on top of it it was with a skull merchant.
140380	143583	We went into the movie theater level and played pinball.
145188	145348	and Rob.
168625	173909	One day this week, we're going to do a custom and make it so we can.
173909	184656	So so I can at least let you be prepared for what happens with the unknown and and show you the the pinball arcade and everything in the movie theater.
184656	185977	It's actually really neat.
185977	194063	And there's even a little stage area up there that you can't get to, but it's sorely wished I could so that that we could like do pretend Rocky.
194063	194303	Yeah.
194643	196104	It looks like a neat level from what I've seen.
196104	199026	But anyway, I had a ghostface do pretend Rocky with me.
199026	205109	Let me make sure I also introduce somebody to the program who maybe doesn't play Dead by Daylight, but still enjoys the occasional spooky game.
205109	207231	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
207231	207751	Hello.
207751	210853	Okay, well, you definitely have like some game footage playing behind you tonight.
210853	212674	That's definitely a spooky looking game.
212674	217257	I don't recognize this because it looks like a Shooty McShooter game.
217257	217857	But what is this?
219186	220306	Fallout 4 Silent Hill
242045	242585	Got it.
242585	245488	Yeah, I didn't get into Fallout the same way I did Elder Scrolls.
245488	246048	I don't know why.
246048	247369	Maybe I need to give it another chance.
247369	252573	But yeah, yes, I know everybody's going bananas over the Fallout show.
252573	254474	It was apparently really good.
254474	256476	So I needed to force myself to sit down and watch it.
256476	260259	But I've actually been playing quite a few video games this week.
260259	262200	So we'll get into that in a little bit.
262200	268465	But first, actually, I wanted to say here at the top of the show before we get into our kickoff story tonight, which hopefully, Loki, you're good to do.
269566	277416	Big thanks to everybody out there for the love on our 1000th episode, which was last week, of course.
277416	279579	We had a lot of great donations live.
279579	285027	We made more, not that it's money, but money does help pay for the business license and keep everything official here.
285327	290291	We made more money last night than we ever have in one night of programming here at Voice Geeks Network.
290291	293093	So just want to really thank everybody for their generosity.
293093	299797	And even if you're listening on the podcast feed, I saw a lot of love on social media, we saw the you know, thank you emails and so forth.
299797	302559	So I just I just wanted to really thank everybody for that.
302559	306922	And we're still trucking on to episode 1001.
306922	308083	Thanks to all of you out there.
308083	310205	So big thanks to everybody out there.
310205	314948	And I know we just mentioned the subathon, but a happy belated to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
315765	317206	Thank you, I appreciate it.
317206	318267	You're welcome.
318267	321310	How does 29 feel?
321310	322651	Fuck 20s.
322651	323632	That's true, that's true.
323632	324893	I'm like a solid 32.
324893	327956	Okay.
327956	335522	Cause like, I have, honestly though, it's, it's been kind of surreal.
335522	340647	Cause like mentally I don't feel like where I am.
342341	345964	but I certainly do feel like it in my hips today.
345964	352688	Oh my God, all that walking and then sitting, being stuck on the five.
352688	363576	Fucking five traffic and people with their really bright headlights that aren't quite, you know, like high beams, but they could fool me.
363576	366278	Can you please add in a get off my lawn or a...
367327	369651	No, I don't have a lawn.
369651	370593	All right.
370593	371975	I will yellow the cloud, though.
371975	372315	All right.
372315	374158	That works.
374158	374840	Yeah.
374840	376122	Damn you, cloud.
376122	378325	You should have taken Tifa on the date.
379702	381103	I always take Tifa on the date.
381103	382283	What are you talking about?
382283	382623	All right.
382623	384904	I need to go get another drink.
384904	385164	All right.
385164	396629	Well, then let's move on into our kickoff story tonight, which is a little bit of a sad kind of, you know, one of those things that isn't surprising in this day and age of video games is still a little bit of a blindside.
396629	397470	Loki, start us off.
397950	399852	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
416485	420487	either the whole game or a portion of the game.
420487	429752	This has been an ongoing issue since January of this year for LittleBigPlanet 3 where they had their online server shut down.
429752	442459	It was supposed to be temporarily while they were investigating some malicious code or mods that were being used on those servers that actually could cause your
443840	444462	Thanks for watching!
450385	461235	Looking at it, I guess, for the last three months, they said, you know, do the ongoing technical issues which resulted in the LittleBigPlanet 3 servers for PlayStation 4 being taken offline.
461235	467381	Temporarily, in January 2024, the decision has been made to keep those servers offline indefinitely.
467381	473687	All online services, including access to other players' creations for LittleBigPlanet 3, are no longer available.
474710	485341	So essentially, you cannot access any of the user generated content that's been made for LittleBigPlanet for the last 16 years or so.
485341	486703	So yeah.
488106	498055	And for those that may not know, LittleBigPlanet was a game on Sony's service that was basically a Mario clone-ish type of game.
498055	499197	You know, it had its own mechanics.
499197	500278	It wasn't a complete clone.
500278	503621	But the big kicker was that you could build your own levels.
503621	508505	And there were all sorts of different mechanics where people were able to build these very elaborate things.
508505	513951	And I remember in the original LittleBigPlanet, and I imagine later ones, it actually even supported the eye toy.
514651	515552	and Bobby Blackwolf.
535382	545985	And I remember my favorite LittleBigPlanet level of all time in the original was a Parker Posey tribute level where you just would unlock all of these stickers that have Parker Posey's picture on them, which is great.
545985	546765	Genius.
546765	548985	Who doesn't love Parker Posey?
548985	551166	And if you're going to sit there and say, who?
551166	553006	Then do your research.
553006	562088	Parker Posey is an amazing actress who's been in a variety of movies, including Scream 3, where she was the comic relief, or Josie and the Pussycats, which is a completely underrated movie.
562088	562889	But anyway, I digress.
564469	571893	The thing is, though, is that the LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2, those servers shut down some time ago.
571893	577115	But in LittleBigPlanet 3, all of the old levels were still playable.
577115	580677	So LittleBigPlanet 3 essentially housed all of these old levels.
580677	585059	And I believe LittleBigPlanet 1 and 2 were PlayStation 3 games.
585059	588521	And then LittleBigPlanet 3 was a PlayStation 4 game, if I remember right.
588601	589602	Yeah, that's correct.
602881	609108	but yeah, the PlayStation 3 servers for LittleBigPlanet 3 had been, I think, taken offline earlier.
622083	628890	And what's annoying too is like when you hear the PlayStation 3 version of the game was taken down the servers because of DDoS attacks.
628890	630551	Like, who's DDoSing this game?
630551	631452	Like, why?
631452	633073	Like, why are you doing that?
633073	639259	And then on top of it, now the PlayStation 4 stuff because of malicious mods, like...
640984	651168	This is why we don't have nice things like where people are fighting so hard as it is for preservation on this stuff and you have people also ruining it with this type of stuff as well.
651168	653729	People that are ruining it don't care like and that's the sad thing.
653729	657171	Yeah, it's you know, karma's gonna get you bitch.
657171	658791	That's all I have to say.
658791	667855	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
668195	672438	right after the Bobby Blackwell show and Bobby is in our chat, he sometimes hangs out after his show, saying,
698115	700758	Sackboy's Big Adventure Game
714130	722856	which I think was kind of supposed to be LittleBigPlanet 4, but it really wasn't because it didn't have any of the custom stuff in it, which to me, defeated the whole purpose.
722856	723856	But there was that.
723856	727099	And then of course, there was the other, Dreams, right?
727099	732102	The one that kind of didn't have a lot of backing from Sony, it felt like.
732102	733543	It was a very big playground.
733543	740928	But that, I feel like Dreams has come down before this ultimately got taken down, which is interesting in its own way.
740928	741088	So.
743479	745581	It's unfortunate.
745581	750264	It's a bummer there isn't a way to carry these levels forward because a lot of people worked hard on them.
752513	761880	There is something else to consider here, though, is that technically these have been down since January, and it's only being reported on now because it's not coming back.
761880	767585	You did not see the same love on social media, on podcasts such as this, on YouTube.
767585	774190	You did not see the same memorials in January because most people, let's be real, probably didn't notice.
774810	784635	There's probably very few people, I'm sure there's a very strong LittleBigPlanet community, a few loyalists still making levels, they probably noticed, but most people, the average gamer hasn't noticed.
784635	795041	And so now it's only that like, well, you can never have Thing again, that everybody's gonna go, but I missed Thing, even though it's actually been gone for two months, and nobody's missed it yet.
795041	795401	So
796786	797887	There is that to consider.
797887	806011	But it does kind of stink, especially for people that spent time making levels, doing the thing, that there wasn't any way to maybe back it up.
806011	808713	But well, I guess you would have a local copy on your own PlayStation.
808713	811855	Yeah, if you have the levels downloaded, you can still play them.
811855	812375	Yeah.
812375	815337	But you can't play anything.
815337	817038	We can't download anything new.
817038	817218	Yeah.
818018	823124	And E3VL in our chat mentions that Dreams was difficult to make levels compared to LittleBigPlanet.
823124	826067	And E3VL also points out people having their nostalgia trip.
826067	829831	Well, the interesting thing about LittleBigPlanet was that there was all sorts of nostalgia trips in it, right?
829831	832134	Because people could make their own thing.
832134	835537	And so it led to some very creative, like people were making shooter games a little
836377	836897	BigPlanet
852102	854504	Again, I understand the facts.
854504	858146	It's not like Sony can just release the code and people can make their own servers.
858146	861308	That's really not a realistic reality.
861308	873277	It would be nice if maybe, I don't know, you could package your download and put it on the internet and submit, but obviously that would take recoding for a years old game that they don't have the resources to do.
873277	880682	So I get it from that standpoint, but it just, it's, it's sad, especially because it's all gone.
883092	884513	Yeah.
884513	889395	Dark2C in chat says, weirdly, this is making me miss Game Builder Garage over on Switch.
889395	897400	Well, enjoy it while you can, because in a few years, I mean, especially because we know they just pulled the plug on the Wii U and the 3DS, right?
897400	901402	All those all those Mario Maker levels they were trying to beat the original Mario Maker.
901402	905764	Someday, not soon, but someday, that's going to be the Nintendo Switch as well.
905764	907245	They're going to pull all those servers, too.
907245	908365	So except for Pokemon.
908365	909366	That's right.
909366	910927	Do this stuff on PC.
910927	911187	Yeah.
912807	913628	Play those.
913628	919754	I'm sure they've got some sort of equivalent type of game on PC and just, you know, kind of do it there.
919754	929664	At least you have a little bit of luck that, you know, a server still could go down, but, you know, it's a lot more flexible as far as being able to, you know, keep that stuff longer.
930040	937886	Interesting you mentioned that because we've seen Sony start to do more of a pivot where they are making more of their releases on PC, right?
937886	944411	We've seen the Horizons, the God of Wars, we've seen the big franchises show up on PC.
944411	951516	So do you think there's a possibility we could ever maybe get a little Big Planet 4 on PC?
951516	952317	Maybe?
952317	952457	Yeah.
953424	953885	Thanks for watching!
967219	968660	Oh, is that in that games on PC?
968660	969320	Is it?
969320	973621	Oh, so I have it on PlayStation because it was a plus game at some point.
973621	975382	So I grabbed that and it was fine.
975382	977463	I mean, it's more 3d platforming.
977463	981445	So I understand maybe why it was harder to build your own levels in that game.
981445	985386	But I would I would really love to see the little big planet franchise make a comeback.
985386	986186	But I just don't know.
986186	987367	I don't know if the demand is there.
987987	989888	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1010805	1014590	Anyway, let's move on and talk about the games we have been playing this week.
1014590	1016152	And how was your gaming week?
1016152	1018655	I know nobody's been playing LittleBigPlanet.
1018655	1019737	What have you been playing?
1019737	1022160	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1022160	1027747	Um, I actually didn't do my retro night because I was just getting back from San Jose last night.
1027747	1028408	So, um,
1029542	1031964	I played lots of Dead by Daylight.
1031964	1033486	Lots.
1033486	1035728	So much.
1035728	1041773	I also played a little bit of Final Resistance.
1041773	1043195	We put in the module.
1043195	1045076	So Weird Al is out for a little bit.
1045076	1046117	We put in Final Resistance.
1047089	1055875	Um, I also played R-Type Dimensions on iOS, just cause I was feeling a little nostalgic and hated myself some.
1055875	1058897	So I played, I played, uh, R-Type.
1058897	1060178	Yeah.
1060178	1067643	Um, and, um, I played some, um, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora just cause I love that, that game so much.
1067643	1068604	I've already beaten it.
1068604	1070945	I'm doing all the end quests.
1070945	1075869	And, um, and apparently it looks like tonight I'm going to be playing Cult of the Lamb.
1075869	1076089	Fun.
1077073	1077653	How was your gaming week?
1093493	1103516	Turbo Kid, the game I talked about last week and we had kind of playing behind us last week, really, really well put together Metroidvania game.
1103516	1105297	I highly recommend you check it out.
1105297	1107237	If you haven't, you can check it on PC.
1107237	1112119	I don't know if it's on consoles at all, but it's a very good game.
1112119	1118141	It's even better if you're like familiar with the source material, but you don't have to be.
1118141	1121122	It's just overall a solid Metroidvania game.
1121122	1122562	Like, I really enjoy it.
1124434	1125775	All right, that's it.
1125775	1133400	I want to play some Fallout, but you know, haven't gotten all my mods situated now that the game's gonna be updating, you know, later this week.
1133400	1135181	It's gonna break everything.
1135181	1136562	You know, that'll be fun.
1136562	1137663	Yeah.
1137663	1138844	All right.
1138844	1139484	My Game of the Week.
1139484	1140825	I actually have a few things to talk about.
1140825	1145348	Yes, I've played the normal stuff like Final Fantasy 14 and Diablo 4 and all that good stuff.
1145348	1150031	I played Dead by Daylight with Jamie, as we talked about earlier, but I actually have some different stuff to talk about.
1150031	1153453	So one of them, I want to talk about this because it is a game I've talked about before.
1153453	1153834	However,
1154955	1160484	Niantic has made the best quality of life change ever to one of their games.
1160484	1167695	The best, like, the most amazing quality of life change I've ever seen Niantic do, they have done in one of their games, and it is not Pokemon Go.
1168840	1181392	It is, but this, this is the feature I never knew I needed in Pokemon Go until now, and I have this really interesting feeling it will never come to Pokemon Go, because I think we're gonna see this very interesting difference.
1181392	1193403	I have a feeling Niantic is very siloed, because I feel like Niantic's Japanese arm, which made Monster Hunter now, is on a very different page, because the quality of life update is in Monster Hunter now.
1194264	1204866	which in some ways I think has cemented itself now as Niantic's best game which is wild to say at this point but this quality of life change is that good
1206176	1209158	And Bobby Blackovenchat says, is it Pikmin Bloom?
1209158	1211099	I do love Pikmin Bloom for what it's worth.
1211099	1213560	I think Pikmin Bloom for what it is, is a solid game.
1213560	1216042	And I think it is a great walking incentivizer.
1216042	1220264	And I think it took them about a year to get the formula right, but they got the formula right.
1220264	1223286	And I feel like it isn't trying to ask for too much of your money.
1223286	1231031	And it has a very interesting sort of, you know, unique grab, unique Pikmin type of loop.
1231031	1232952	It has a unique game loop that's kind of works for them.
1233672	1241799	But let me talk about Monster Hunter now for a minute, because Monster Hunter now I feel like, you know, has, which is interesting, because I don't play Monster Hunter on consoles, I've tried and not into it.
1241799	1246783	But slowly, this game has really been growing on me, I think this game is really good when it's multiplayer.
1246783	1250386	When you're it's not just tap, tap, tap, tap, tapping to attack a gym.
1250386	1255751	Yes, it's tapping to attack, but you have to swipe to dodge things, you're swiping back and forth to roll around.
1255751	1259374	And you actually see all four players going around the monster and like,
1259714	1264278	One of you might paralyze it so the other can get a shot in with a super bow and arrow or whatever.
1264278	1266219	It actually plays really smooth.
1266219	1269142	And here's what they did in Monster Hunter now.
1269142	1274546	So they took the concept of the Pokemon gyms and they call them huntathons.
1274546	1284514	So the places that are Pokestops or portals or mushrooms, depending on what Niantic game you play, those places are nodes, basically gathering nodes in Monster Hunter.
1285274	1313173	every hour or so certain gathering nodes will turn into huntathons where five harder monsters will show up for you to fight back to back to back and you get a group of people you go in and you fight the monsters and there's some monsters that will only show up in the huntathons so you know you're kind of incentivized to do them to get the rare materials etc etc the way it works very similar to pokemon go right here's the quality of life update they made this week that is a game changer
1314571	1320577	Let's say I walk to the park down the street and join a hunt-a-thon, but I'm by myself.
1320577	1327144	If I join the hunt-a-thon, after 10 seconds, the hunt-a-thon will now say, expanding range.
1327144	1336574	And at that point, anybody else in the world waiting to do the same monster I am at their park will now get matched with me.
1337734	1343738	And so in a matter of about 45 seconds, you'll fill up with a party of four all about to do the same monster.
1343738	1350543	It's brilliant because it meets Niantic's criteria of their goal of getting out and exploring, right?
1350543	1359208	I've still got to go to my park, go to the huntathon where it's out, but I get match made with people to do the thing I need to do.
1359208	1362651	Pokemon Go needs this like yesterday.
1363191	1392991	this would be the thing that remote instead of remote raids it should be this a matchmaking raid pass because that way when you can't find anybody to do the elite you want to do you get match made with other people waiting to do the exact same thing that's what monster hunter now did and my biggest were and it works really really well and uh yeah you have to wait a little bit but would you rather wait a minute or like never get to do it i i think the minute wait is is well worth it so it's the best quality of life change i've ever seen and i am so worried
1393931	1401473	that when Niantic in the USA figures out what Niantic Japan has done, they're going to say, oh, no, you need to charge for that.
1401473	1403133	You need to sell a pass for that.
1403133	1404833	You need to hunt a thumper.
1404833	1406674	And I am begging Niantic.
1406674	1409794	I am begging Niantic, don't fuck this up.
1409794	1413875	Because if you start selling that pass, guess what?
1413875	1416596	Now the pool of people wanting to do it is not going to be there.
1416596	1417376	It's not going to work.
1418302	1418742	Thanks for watching!
1442029	1467301	Bobby BlackWolf in chat says don't make me get Monster Hunter now and Bonz006 says what Bobby said well before you all get it let me put my referral code in chat so I can get the items but I you know what I'm not gonna say everybody's gonna love it I think you know I don't know if you'd love it Bobby like you might like it for a little while but then the grind and an action part you might get kind of bored of it I don't know I think Pikmin blooms like more up your alley but
1468913	1469755	It is free.
1469755	1470738	It's worth a shot.
1470738	1472021	I don't know.
1472021	1473505	I've kicked the game money.
1473505	1475169	I bought additional storage and all that.
1475169	1475751	So anyway.
1477011	1482075	That's, let's see, Bobby Blackoven Chat says, I think that should be the argument to Niantic.
1482075	1486599	More people will buy Huntathon tickets if they can guarantee getting a full hunt.
1486599	1489862	That, that, that part, that is it.
1489862	1503713	Yes, so I'm really hoping that Niantic Japan has already cleared this with the rest of Niantic, because I am really worried, because this is way better than the change that Pokemon Go made, or the reversion, I should say.
1503713	1503954	All right.
1504634	1506315	Anyway, that's a game I've already played.
1506315	1510939	Again, Bonds006 in the Google Play Store right now.
1510939	1515082	Just wait to get my referral code, please.
1515082	1517984	Okay, other games I've played this week.
1519505	1520626	Ayudin Chronicles
1542597	1546618	Konami is not cranking out their strong IP like they used to.
1546618	1549059	This is essentially C code and six, right?
1549059	1554380	So I didn't Chronicles was on Kickstarter years ago, and finally the game is coming out.
1554380	1562082	And for those that backed it, which I did, I got my digital code for PlayStation five, a couple days ago, and I've been playing and I'm a little ways into the game.
1562082	1567103	I'm not going to spoil where I'm at, but I'm about four hours in and I just beat the abandoned mine.
1567523	1568223	That's all I'll say.
1568223	1569784	That's a pretty spoiler-free.
1569784	1579327	So I'd say as a decent chunk of the first part of the game down, it is very much a PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 RPG.
1579327	1584309	If you are the person that's saying, why can't they make Final Fantasy games like they used to?
1584309	1586530	Why can't they just make a turn-based battle game like they used to?
1586530	1589551	Why is everything had to be, why can't they just make the game like they used to?
1589551	1590051	Guess what?
1590771	1593975	this game, they made like they used to.
1593975	1598200	And that is both a positive, I think, and it's going to be a negative for some people.
1598200	1603287	Because when it comes to the graphics and things like it, it kind of looks like a PlayStation one or two.
1603287	1605690	Yeah, I mean, there's some certain effects and things that are nice.
1605690	1605790	It's
1605950	1608512	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1631294	1632895	But yeah, I'm enjoying the game.
1632895	1635677	I feel like there's a lot more layers to the game I haven't found yet.
1635677	1641461	Just looking at the trophies, it seems like there's all these mini-games and management systems I have not got to yet.
1641461	1646024	So I'm not really gonna form my full opinion of the game, but I'm engaged enough.
1646024	1650067	I think the story's interesting enough.
1650067	1659113	I skipped most of the voice acting, but as far as what's going on, again, it's very PlayStation 1 RPG.
1659113	1660754	And I think that'll be what most people want.
1661834	1663856	DJ Ranma S in chat says it's coming to Game Pass.
1663856	1666178	If I end up liking it, I'll secure a physical copy.
1666178	1668920	And Bobby Blackwolf is saying, yeah, Tuesday it unlocks on Game Pass.
1668920	1671301	Yeah, Tuesday is the official release date of the game.
1671301	1674464	So I think a lot more of you will be jumping on that.
1674464	1679628	By the way, Konami is supposed to release a remaster of Suikoden, Suikoden 2, 1 and 2.
1679628	1680768	They announced that some time ago.
1680768	1685832	It keeps getting delayed, and we don't know when it's ever coming out.
1685832	1686633	Good job, Konami.
1686633	1687794	Good job.
1687794	1687994	Anyway.
1689244	1695586	Questbuster in chat says the side-scrolling prelude for Aiden was okay too, just relied way too much on disposable side-questing.
1695586	1700007	I actually never played Aiden Chronicles, or excuse me, Aiden Rising, sorry.
1700007	1702107	Aiden Chronicle Rising, whatever it was called.
1702107	1705728	I never played that, so I have no opinion on how it ties into this game.
1705728	1708189	I do not feel lost in the story whatsoever.
1708189	1711770	It's a very straightforward JRPG story.
1712890	1721456	hero has left hometown and come to be a hero in this new place where he's found a gang of ragtag misfits to gang up with.
1721456	1727820	It's very like, it's every fucking JRPG story, but it's fine.
1727820	1728200	It's fine.
1728200	1729381	You know what?
1729381	1732023	That's what all you fuckers have been asking for.
1732023	1733824	So here it is.
1733824	1738888	So don't bitch when you go in and be like, well, it's just a fucking PlayStation one game.
1738888	1741169	Isn't that what you asked for?
1741169	1741630	Here it is.
1742486	1744450	Just keep that in mind.
1744450	1746113	All right.
1746113	1748136	So there's that game.
1748136	1749419	One more game I played this week.
1750353	1751254	that's new.
1751254	1755517	I'm not sure I'm supposed to be talking about this, but I saw people streaming it.
1755517	1756358	So fuck it.
1756358	1762202	I'm just going to talk about Hades 2 early access or early testing.
1762202	1763804	Yes, I got in.
1763804	1765385	I don't know how I did.
1765385	1766986	I bid for it like anyone else.
1766986	1768948	No special connections that were not that big a show.
1768948	1770709	I don't have no special connections or nothing.
1770709	1774892	So I bid like everybody else I got in, I guess I put in a few hours on Steam.
1774892	1776253	And I've been playing a little bit of Hades 2.
1777628	1778609	It's great.
1778609	1779329	It's great.
1779329	1786153	It's it's just the right mix of everything you remember for the first game with like a couple new mechanics to mix it up.
1786153	1794878	Like the new hero, she's got these things where she can like charge and she's got like a different like different like AoE thing and she can charge so it has this MP mechanic.
1794878	1800602	It definitely seems like there are more things built into the roguelite, more currencies and things to save up.
1800602	1804344	But that's exactly what you would expect in a sort of sequel to Hades.
1804904	1810725	Um, I was absolutely sold from the, you know, it's only the first area in the, uh, preview.
1810725	1812206	I couldn't even beat the boss though.
1812206	1818387	Let me tell you, uh, it's difficult, but I, I did feel like I was making forward progress, so I'm sold.
1818387	1820588	I will buy this game the moment it's in early access.
1820588	1821208	It was great.
1821208	1822708	I love the original Hades.
1822708	1824869	Hades 2 looks like it's going to be just as good.
1824869	1825629	Good news.
1825629	1829950	And yes, the most important question, everybody is still hot.
1831547	1836909	that is, I'm sure everybody is still hot.
1836909	1839510	It's a lot of new characters, but they're all hot.
1839510	1845292	And even the ones that got older, mommy, daddy, hot.
1845292	1849094	So all your concerns there are fine.
1849094	1849674	So there you go.
1850831	1853894	All right, that was my gaming week.
1853894	1859740	So with that, let's get into some other news, what's going on throughout gaming.
1859740	1864084	Just quick housekeeping note, we have shows planned for the next few weeks.
1864084	1870190	The next show we will be off, we will not be here live, and there will be no show on the podcast feed, will be Memorial Day weekend.
1870931	1871312	LOKI
1888885	1905829	This is not too much of a surprise to me because I've been seeing their physical media section dwindling slowly over time, but Target has confirmed that they're going to stop selling physical media in stores, or at least, I think they're mostly talking about DVDs and Blu-ray.
1905829	1910130	They specifically mentioned DVDs.
1910130	1912331	Yeah, I mean, they've kind of already done that.
1912331	1917132	They have like one aisle that is DVDs and Blu-ray, and
1918766	1922029	There's not much of a selection there, not surprising.
1922029	1930556	Games too though, like I have seen that games, they don't keep a lot of stock on, so that's not too surprising either.
1930556	1934700	It's a lot of cards, like you look at Switch, it's a lot of digital cards now.
1935000	1958252	well yeah yeah for sure and you look at like actually their physical media what they have out like most of it is out of stock all the time so they said that they're transitioning to limited assortment of dvds and it could be that they're talking just strictly dvds because i mean who has dvds anymore um based on our guest shopping patterns and broader industry trends we are transitioning to the limited assortment of dvds we carry in store
1958672	1962056	to Target.com where guests will continue to find thousands of titles.
1962056	1962296	Yeah.
1962296	1962496	Okay.
1962496	1963317	Whatever.
1963317	1973468	Moving forward, we will offer select DVDs in store when they are newly released or during key times throughout the year when they are more popular for gift giving during the holidays and stuff like that.
1973468	1975771	I mean, I think that's kind of what they're already doing.
1975911	1979754	Also, DVDs are still pretty big for TV shows, I think.
1979754	1987121	I mean, I think they do a lot on Blu-ray, but especially a lot of old TV shows are what I'm imagining because, like, you have a ton of devices that can play DVDs at this point.
1987121	1989643	Even if you have an old Wii, those things play DVDs.
1989643	1994127	They're kid cartoons, Nickelodeon-type fair cartoons.
1994127	2001053	You know, if you maybe live in a place where streaming isn't reliable, you probably have quite a collection of child DVDs for this type of thing.
2001053	2002755	I would imagine is where this is most useful.
2003877	2009463	And like I said, I don't think they have a lot of space on the shelf for this kind of stuff.
2009463	2013808	They're not really keeping a lot of inventory anyways.
2013808	2015550	And it seems to me that like...
2017190	2020474	Yeah, I mean it doesn't make sense for them to keep that stuff in stores.
2020474	2025900	Best Buy has already removed physical movies and TV shows from their shelves.
2025900	2030346	I think that the trend is that they're seeing a lot of people just order stuff online.
2030346	2034530	Not a lot of... We're kind of beyond the time period where people are
2035111	2039174	Browsing the DVD section in a store to like find stuff.
2039174	2040555	Ooh, that looks interesting.
2040555	2042497	Like nobody really does that nowadays.
2042497	2044038	It's more of like browsing online.
2044038	2047140	Everybody sits on the Netflix menu going, ooh, what should I watch?
2047140	2049742	Should I watch that or that or that?
2049742	2057808	There's some study out that people spend hours on the, like they spend more time figuring out what the fuck to watch than they actually spend watching it.
2057808	2058068	Wild.
2058809	2085526	yeah so i mean guilty it it now i i want to say that it looks like now the article is trying to say well those means that they're getting rid of physical games either they have not mentioned that at all i think that's a little bit different because the demand is much higher for that whereas if we saw some equivalent to you know say i mean we have like a x cloud and stuff like that let's just say like an actual equivalent to like netflix size
2086306	2089468	Streaming service for games which everyone's like, oh, I'm just gonna use that.
2089468	2101317	You know, I'm not gonna bother buying games I mean, I mean xCloud certainly trying to position itself that way and PlayStation now exists But I I don't think that we're at that point yet to where
2102017	2105440	folks are going to just stop buying at some point.
2105440	2109783	You're already seeing, I think, game companies just start to move away from physical in general.
2109783	2114607	Like, you know, there's less copies of newer games available in stores than there used to be.
2114607	2117349	They want you to go digital because they make more money that way.
2117349	2122553	Why should Target get 30% of the cut when Sony can get 30% of the cut by selling it in their own store digitally?
2122553	2124314	They already get 30% of the cut.
2124314	2125235	I guess they get more now.
2125455	2130998	Yeah, and which, you know, would make me wonder about a lot of these kind of antitrust things.
2130998	2134260	But that's that's the whole other that's somebody else's problem, I guess.
2134260	2141684	But yeah, I think there's a lot of the publishers are kind of nudging towards digital as well.
2141684	2153791	Quite honestly, I would not be surprised whatsoever if the PlayStation six, the next Xbox, maybe not the next switch, but maybe two switches from now won't even have drives.
2154687	2158077	Microsoft already wanted to do this a while ago
2162768	2188113	Right, I think this is horrible for game preservation as far as like actually but we're not to that point yet as far as like actual you know physical media going away and I don't know especially now that we're on this trend with game publishers really pushing that hey you don't own this product we're just licensing it to you and we could just take it back even though you've already given us money we could just say oh well you can you have to stop playing it now you know
2188573	2188874	DarkSakura
2203823	2205965	I don't care if you pay me money, pay me more money.
2205965	2207066	Buy my new thing.
2207066	2209127	You can't play your old thing.
2209127	2214572	Whereas folks, I think, are used to owning things.
2214572	2218955	Certainly newer generations, maybe that may change.
2218955	2223539	But I think we may still see more of a push of not getting rid of that physical media.
2223539	2225120	Especially if you have Nintendo still doing it.
2227186	2228107	I don't know.
2228107	2231189	I have a PC, so, I mean, like, Sony, Microsoft are kind of covered.
2231189	2249463	Yeah, I don't know why I bought an Xbox One X, this, uh, or a Series X. It seems like a waste of money at this point because I just play anything I want on PC, but, eh, live and learn.
2249463	2251904	Yeah, um, I, I, I...
2253969	2258493	This physical media stuff is definitely slipping away.
2258493	2264617	And at least I'm glad that Microsoft has sort of made a commitment to backwards compatibility.
2264617	2267239	We saw that a couple weeks ago, I want to say.
2267239	2278147	We saw that there was that, you know, email that Sarah Bond had sent out that was talking about that they were creating a team to sort of ensure that there was going to be longevity and forward thinking as well with the games they were creating.
2278147	2278928	And I have to admit,
2279748	2296921	It does make me a little more, I'm not going to say everything that's multi-platform I'm going to get on Xbox now, but it does make me think, you know, for the long future, if this is something available on Microsoft and PlayStation, might I pick it up on Microsoft knowing that they've made a commitment to make this a future forward product?
2296921	2300824	Is that something that weighs on your mind too, Loki, or no, you don't really care?
2301963	2311033	Nah, I mean, I know they want to get out of the console business a little bit just because it's not profitable.
2311033	2321745	But at the same time, like, I don't know, just push everything PC, like, but then there's competition on PC, you don't have your closed gardens that you want, even though you're saying that
2322585	2326246	Oh, we want to be multi-platform and stuff, but really they don't.
2326246	2327806	They would rather not be.
2327806	2334708	It's just that they are forced to do that financially to make up, make more sales because once again, infinite growth.
2334708	2340069	And once you've tapped out your entire platform, where do you go from there?
2340069	2346810	You got to go to other platforms to get more customers because infinite growth, which is impossible, but
2347847	2351050	We're living the impossible dream in corporation land.
2351050	2354452	So it's like, whatever.
2354452	2357355	We'll just see how it plays out, I guess.
2357355	2361858	I mean, obviously it hasn't stopped me on the PC side because I own everything digitally there.
2361858	2363379	So like, I don't know.
2363379	2363740	That's true.
2363740	2368964	What was the last physical PC game you bought that actually had an installation disk and not a code?
2368964	2371045	It would have to have been a World of Warcraft.
2371966	2373629	Thank you for watching!
2385570	2386971	Oh, good call.
2386971	2397114	Um, I want to also call this out what Bobby Blackwell said in chat saying I also got infinite wealth digitally on Xbox so I could play it on my PC as well.
2397114	2402855	And I keep forgetting that is a huge perk that some not all but some Xbox games have is that it's got that hole.
2402855	2407637	If you buy it on one platform, you have it on both, which I think is huge, which is great.
2408217	2409459	Speaking of Nintendo.
2423200	2440160	Let's talk about their Indie World presentation that they did this week because things have been very quiet on the Nintendo front otherwise, but they are definitely using Indies to sort of fill in the gaps, so to speak.
2441562	2442362	Yars Rising Revenge Reimagined
2466189	2476639	So it kind of doesn't look anything like Yars' Revenge, except maybe it looked like there was a mini game in the background that kind of looked like maybe you could play Yars' Revenge in Yars Rising, which great.
2476639	2485307	Atari has found, just like the episodes of this show, they have found 1001 ways to play Yars' Revenge all over again.
2485307	2489091	Is there a such thing in the world as too much of a good thing?
2490882	2497965	Look, I love Yars' Revenge, but Atari is really pushing it when it comes to this game.
2497965	2498546	But I don't know.
2498546	2499646	I don't know.
2499646	2503528	Except for the voice acting, the game did look kind of neat, so I don't know.
2503528	2505209	I'd be curious about it.
2505209	2511972	There was also a game called Little Kitty Big City, where yes, you know what the game is about?
2511972	2514834	A little cat in a big city.
2514834	2515394	Kitties!
2516960	2520543	Refined Self, Sticky Business, Anton Blast, Valley Peaks, Lorelai and the Laser Eyes
2534816	2547426	Europa, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Splintered Fate, which is a co-op and rogue-ish take on the Switch, and that's a timed console exclusive, so it'll be on other platforms, but it'll be timed console.
2547426	2553690	Speaking of cats, Cat Quest 3 is coming out on August 8th on the Switch, so you have that to look forward to.
2553690	2555512	Stitch came out
2556292	2560795	The day of the announcement and everything is coming out as well.
2560795	2561995	So yeah, they had a lot.
2561995	2573442	And then there was one more thing, which was SteamWorld Heist 2, which is a follow up where I guess the original crew now goes to outer space.
2573442	2573702	Sure.
2573702	2574543	Interesting.
2574543	2576664	Oh, no, they are now not in space.
2576664	2578485	They are in naval combat.
2578485	2578925	And right.
2578925	2580847	So it's our pirates type of thing.
2580847	2582568	Everybody's making a pirate game this year.
2582568	2582968	Why not?
2584175	2587657	DarkTutsuya wants to point out a very important update.
2587657	2589939	For LittleKittyBigCity, you can give them a hat.
2607260	2616844	SSJ100 Matt is complaining, we need more puppy games, the pro feline game lobbyists have too deep pockets.
2622449	2629314	It was, it was like a Pokemon snap type game, but you were, it was paparazzi or something like that, if I remember correctly.
2629314	2630215	Yeah.
2630215	2642123	And you know, I know, I know we haven't talked a lot about that emulator that suddenly showed up on iOS recently, but if you are a, if you're an iPhone or iPad person, there's a really easy emulator out there.
2642123	2651870	And the reason why I bring it up is that it plays DS games and I've seen so many Nintendogs screenshots on my feeds this week of people rediscovering that.
2652570	2657195	I'm surprised that Apple's just like, yeah, this is cool.
2657195	2658016	Let's do this.
2658016	2661319	I haven't been able to find it's in the App Store, right?
2661319	2663081	Yeah, it's called Delta.
2663081	2665123	And you just have to go past all the travel apps.
2665123	2670428	The icon is a purple triangle looking thing.
2671289	2672609	and that's that's the app.
2672609	2675090	And in fact, I'll show you how easy it is.
2675090	2676811	I'm pulling it up.
2676811	2681452	The first and only game I installed on that look how fast I mean, as you should.
2681452	2683173	The Guardian Legend right there.
2683173	2684233	There it is.
2684233	2691015	It just just so I can jam out to this music whenever I want.
2691015	2693376	I got it.
2693376	2693896	All right, anyway.
2695837	2698999	I can't really hear it through the... Yeah, I know it doesn't pick up very well on the mic.
2698999	2699860	Sorry, everybody.
2699860	2704944	But the only my only complaint about the emulator is that I hate playing with touch controls.
2704944	2707305	However, it connects to Bluetooth controller.
2707305	2713069	So all I have to do is stop being lazy and get my Xbox controller on there or my PlayStation if I want and I'm set.
2713069	2716172	So that's, that's pretty awesome.
2716172	2716952	All right.
2716952	2719094	Anyway, let's move on DarkSakura.
2720846	2737397	So, um, you know, we're, we're not the, uh, the, uh, only ones that are, you know, have been around for a while and have been rediscovered by some and are in not maybe great shape.
2737397	2737717	I don't know.
2737717	2740539	I'm trying to do a nice little segue.
2740539	2746223	Um, there is a specific trailer that had been at E3.
2748593	2752624	It was the PlayStation year-round E3 trailer.
2752624	2755231	And I'm talking about a physical trailer, not something that you watch.
2755231	2756394	Yeah, not a sizzle reel, yeah.
2757358	2762500	Yeah, it was discovered on Facebook Marketplace for $70,000.
2762500	2769803	And apparently the person selling it didn't really have any clue.
2769803	2778847	But it is an 18-wheeler with a trailer that had a portable E3 show floor and a stage.
2778847	2783009	And so now it's just being sold.
2783009	2784589	People talking about it on Reddit.
2784589	2785870	It's kind of hard to find.
2787892	2799506	It's listed as 1999 Craftsman Double Expandable Stage with nothing about the PlayStation information on it.
2799506	2804593	The author, by the way, of this source, is saying that he only found it because it was local.
2809992	2818295	The trailer was pulled out of storage and hauled about 10 miles to a secure lot.
2818295	2821936	Tires are dry rotted but will need to be replaced before traveling any further distance.
2825583	2830905	I would love to see who gets this thing.
2830905	2837088	I'm so curious about that too, because what a great way to kidnap children, if that's what you wanted to do.
2837088	2839809	The candy van is going to have nothing on the PlayStation bus.
2841690	2846375	It's a little bit of a setup that like do that and you have to fold the whole thing up and everything.
2846375	2850319	I'm just saying what a... It's like, wait there, kid, you play some Gran Turismo or something.
2850319	2852541	I feel like it's a movie plot or something.
2852541	2854503	Because of course, I'm only talking about fiction.
2854503	2855944	I would never talk about the real thing.
2855944	2857506	But you know what I was thinking?
2857506	2861990	Because I've been kind of into the whole tiny home thing lately.
2861990	2865934	Is that like you could totally keep the exterior intact and make it your house.
2869005	2869566	61 Inch Plasma Screens
2888919	2901110	Could we replace the PSP artwork on the trailer with a screenshot of OLRPSP.com, which I don't think is a website that works anymore, by the way, but what it used to be back in the day.
2901110	2903993	Actually, isn't the Shell site still up?
2903993	2906175	I could be wrong.
2906175	2908317	Oh yeah, the domain doesn't work.
2909724	2910986	People, I forgot about this.
2910986	2913148	The domain itself doesn't work anymore.
2913148	2921198	But if you actually go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash PSP, it is still up.
2921198	2924462	The whole PSP site, it's still fucking there.
2924462	2928547	And believe it or not, it still works with our podcast feed.
2929048	2932790	So if you have a PSP that still works, guess what?
2932790	2938614	You can actually still get, you can download episode 1000 and this one tonight, what it's supposed to, because guess what?
2938614	2940535	Some things haven't changed over the last 15 years.
2940535	2943157	And the way we produce this podcast has not changed.
2943157	2946078	So it still reads the feed the exact same way.
2946078	2947519	So- I got it.
2947519	2948920	New byline.
2948920	2954804	OLR, gay, woke, and supporting the PSP.
2954804	2957966	The best gay and woke platform on the PSP.
2957966	2958426	Exactly.
2960638	2962360	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
2982179	2982900	Golden Devils
3001775	3005418	You did a great... Honestly, it was the best publicity probably we ever had.
3005418	3006519	It was... No, the second best.
3006519	3008420	Because the best was iTunes launch.
3008420	3010421	When iTunes launched and we were in there, that was the best.
3010421	3012603	But the second best was OLR PSP.
3012603	3018687	Because we still get emails to this day where somebody will be like, Hey, I've been listening since the OLR PSP days.
3018687	3020849	Or, Hey, I first found OLR on the PSP.
3020849	3021630	And that type of stuff.
3021630	3024272	So... Brilliant.
3024272	3025232	Brilliant.
3025232	3026773	All right.
3026773	3027014	Anyway.
3028586	3029507	Let's move on.
3029507	3034993	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf points out nobody owns olrpsp.com right now.
3034993	3040739	Why do I feel like Bobby is currently logging into a website?
3040739	3042741	All right, anyway.
3042741	3044323	Let's move on.
3044323	3046024	Let's talk about this.
3046024	3048727	You know what, that's how we should spend the money we earned last week.
3050851	3052793	make a new PSP site.
3052793	3058538	Wouldn't you all be so happy that we spent your money on a new PSP website?
3058538	3060300	I'm laughing because I'm being ludicrous.
3060300	3060880	Come on.
3060880	3061280	What?
3061280	3061741	Rob.
3061741	3061981	What?
3061981	3062962	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
3062962	3063442	What?
3063442	3066445	That was that was fucking silly.
3066445	3067706	All right.
3067706	3068507	Moving on.
3068507	3070449	Speaking of silly, Loki.
3070449	3074993	Oh, actually, this is going to be a DarkSakura game pretty soon because I believe as part of her subathon, she has to play it.
3075936	3082801	Yes, that means I have to figure out how to get Fortnite to work on stream and then find people to play with me.
3082801	3083542	So.
3083542	3085664	Well, I won't be one of them, but maybe Alan will play.
3085664	3086244	Well, I'll play.
3086244	3088005	I'll play Festival with you or Lego.
3088005	3090527	I just won't play Battle Royale, but I'll play the other Fortnite games with you.
3090527	3095471	I'm not going to play Festival without like an actual controller that goes.
3095471	3096292	Yeah.
3096292	3100175	So I might play though, but let's I believe we'll see what happens.
3100175	3100635	Yeah.
3100635	3104518	I believe Loki has a story on what you can look forward to in Fortnite, allegedly.
3105399	3106940	Yes, allegedly.
3106940	3122674	So there was some, suppose it looks like a snapshot of a slideshow that are leaks, but then again it is coming from nefarious areas of the internet, but it does look pretty convincing to me.
3122674	3127638	And so some of the things allegedly leaked through here is pretty much everything that
3129468	3132211	Billy Eilish Season 4 Metallica Season 5 Carol G Season 6 Snoop Dogg
3152793	3158256	Battle Royale, getting some Pirates of the Caribbean themed stuff.
3158256	3162118	A new season with Doctor Doom in it.
3162118	3169362	Chapter 2 OG and Chapter 6 launch, as well as they said some new SGT Winter.
3169362	3176626	And then Rocket Racing, a Volcanic Temple themed season, and some Futuristic Sky themed season.
3176626	3179107	And yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
3179107	3179788	I mean, cool.
3180524	3183385	I'd be interesting to see what that actually looks like.
3183385	3184785	But I don't know.
3184785	3189267	Um, then again, I don't think I need to get back in there and play for tonight festival.
3189267	3190307	You know, I did.
3190307	3191528	But this may shock you.
3191528	3192808	I was playing it a lot in the beginning.
3192808	3194348	And then they released Lady Gaga.
3194348	3196249	And I was kind of like, I haven't really played a lot.
3196249	3199450	Yeah, it could all be fake, too.
3199450	3199910	You never know.
3199910	3203771	It could be but I Billy Eilish has a new album coming out.
3203771	3206152	Like there's a lot that kind of lines up and makes sense.
3206152	3208253	So yeah, why not?
3209778	3219240	We know that Star Wars stuff is huge in Lego, but you know, Lego is, Lego is living on third party agreements now with all their Nintendo stuff.
3219240	3220601	Funny, funny story.
3220601	3224742	This office chair that I'm sitting on is really falling apart.
3224742	3226902	And this used to be Alan's chair before it was mine.
3226902	3228362	There's a whole story behind that.
3228362	3230363	So this, this office chair has seen better days.
3230363	3231903	So we were looking for a new office chair.
3231903	3235984	So we were like, where could we get like a fun gamer chair where I could actually go in and sit down and try the chair.
3235984	3237164	And I was like, let's go to Best Buy.
3237164	3238365	They should have them right?
3238365	3238725	Wrong.
3239505	3242028	They don't they don't have them buy them online.
3242028	3243510	And here's the here's the wild thing.
3243510	3245973	They said we have them in the back.
3245973	3248155	If you buy it online, you can pick it up in the store.
3248155	3250918	We just don't have the square footage on the show floor to put them.
3250918	3254322	But you know what they do have the square footage on the show floor for Legos.
3255219	3255620	DarkSakura
3270373	3271013	Holy crap.
3271013	3274116	I was gonna say like your office store should have gamer chairs.
3274116	3275957	That's where I bought mine.
3291887	3294208	We don't really carry those like we used to.
3294208	3296109	I have two over here.
3296109	3299270	And we looked at them and they were like, not at all what I was looking for.
3299270	3303392	And she's like, yeah, it was really big in 2020 during the pandemic.
3303392	3305693	But we've just, you know, really slowed down.
3305693	3307214	People stopped sitting.
3307214	3308974	So like, what are we going to do?
3308974	3313616	All the chairs we bought in 2020 are starting to collapse under all the COVID weight we gained.
3313616	3315277	Like, come on.
3315277	3319399	But we had we just bought it online.
3319399	3319619	Yeah.
3320475	3322497	We just what else could we do?
3322497	3331943	We could have gone to an office store, but I wanted like I wanted a stupid gamer chair, which didn't seem as available at like a Staples or one of those types of things.
3331943	3333304	So yeah, they are.
3333304	3334445	They actually are.
3334445	3339289	Staples has a ton of them, like literally a ton of them.
3339289	3340750	And you can just take them right out of the store.
3340750	3342251	Yeah, that's where I bought mine.
3342251	3343392	And yeah.
3344011	3349873	But if I don't like it, we send it back because we bought it from Costco because of their liberal return policy.
3349873	3352233	So if we don't like it, we're like, yeah, we can just return it.
3352233	3354174	Well, they have like they have a ton of floor models.
3354174	3363477	Like last time I was there, which probably was a year or so ago, they had probably like eight to 16 chairs on the floor.
3363477	3365277	That's where I should have just fucking gone.
3365277	3365557	Oh, well.
3365557	3371019	I mean, they're all like kind of the same, but they did have a selection.
3371019	3371259	Yeah.
3372421	3376193	They did, by the way, a monster high Elvira that's selling for 280 bucks.
3376193	3376434	Oh, my God.
3379912	3384475	Yeah, Mike Deft, you should be using, yeah, I know, ergonomic office chairs.
3384475	3392680	I sat in a bunch of chairs and this one was comfortable to me, although my wife's, you know, ergonomic office chair is comfortable as well.
3392680	3393541	I didn't buy it for the aesthetic.
3393541	3396923	There's a lot of things I should be doing that I don't.
3396923	3401806	So, you know what, let's just put the chair... Of course, then I sit here and complain about back problems.
3401806	3402407	So, you know.
3404048	3406230	Anyway, all right.
3406230	3407891	Let's move on.
3407891	3408792	Let's talk about this.
3408792	3411694	Oh, here's another way you can break your back.
3411694	3416557	Building arcade machines such as the ones behind me from the lovely Arcade1UP.
3416557	3421661	And actually, as much as I'm talking shady, I do love the Replica machines.
3421661	3423322	I think they're great.
3423322	3425404	Not everybody's into them, but that's fine.
3425404	3427385	You don't have to be exactly like anyone else.
3427385	3428906	I think they're kind of neat.
3428906	3431829	And I'm running out of room for these Arcade1UP machines.
3433118	3440640	And of course, when you buy an Arcade1Up machine, they come in a box and you get to assemble it like it was a piece of IKEA furniture.
3440640	3443641	And for the most part, it's not that bad.
3443641	3452564	But when you get to the part where it depends on your machine, really, but most of the standard upright machines, such as the BurgerTime one you see in the background, that was the hardest one to build.
3452564	3454284	But of course, that was my first machine.
3454284	3458406	The Tron one, I'm pretty sure has something wrong with it somewhere, but you don't notice it.
3458406	3458966	It looks fine.
3459966	3465969	The hardest part is putting that screen in at just the right angle and making it all line up.
3465969	3468190	So what am I getting at?
3468190	3473133	Well, Arcade1Up has officially partnered with TaskRabbit.
3473133	3483538	And now TaskRabbit will actually offer a special service on the website where you can hire someone to come to your house and assemble the machine for you.
3483538	3485099	So you don't have to worry about doing it.
3485359	3504285	have the fun I know it says and it's ironic because as I remember correctly TaskRabbit is like owned by IKEA which is really funny that like they they they created the problem and they created the solution and now they're partnering to help others with a similar problem create the solution and you know I
3505427	3519252	Look, I also understand that like, it takes a lot of work and time to build these and it might just be, you know, if you're going to drop $400 on the machine, you might as well spend a little extra money for somebody to build it if you don't want any part of that fun.
3519252	3522373	That part of that fun is a relative word.
3522373	3531417	My concern is knowing how these things work, like TaskRabbit, that they basically just, you know, kind of contract out to these other things.
3532765	3537448	How do I know these people are really specialized at building arcade one-ups?
3537448	3542892	What's going to convince me that they're not going to make all the same mistakes I make when doing it?
3542892	3545654	That's my concern with this whole thing.
3545654	3549377	Were they trained on arcade one-up building?
3549377	3552339	What is going to make them... I don't know.
3553735	3559046	I mean, I don't want to sound all elitist, but it's got an instruction manual.
3559046	3560629	How hard can it really be?
3560629	3562974	I mean, geez, like, seriously.
3562974	3563194	Yeah.
3564065	3570808	again, well, again, it's getting the monitor just the right angle without being afraid of cracking it is not as easy as that.
3570808	3573630	But yes, once you get past that step, the rest of it is not.
3573630	3578152	It's like building any piece of IKEA furniture, you know, some parts are frustrating, the rest of it is not that bad.
3578152	3582374	You just, you know, have to put the A and the B and the C pegs and the D pegs.
3582374	3589357	It's literally, it does not surprise me at all that an IKEA company is partnering here because these arcade one up things are built just like IKEA furniture.
3590296	3603270	Yeah, I mean, I mean, some of the stuff that they have on the site as far as like, things that, you know, mounting a TV to a wall or, you know, hanging artwork on the wall.
3603270	3603410	Yeah.
3604434	3605855	So I don't know.
3605855	3606535	Um, let's see.
3606535	3613978	SG100 Matt in chat says imagine being that TaskRabbit employee that has to keep building arcade one ups to complete training install that monitor again.
3613978	3616959	Maybe they get tools to help them go faster.
3616959	3622681	Maybe they get something that gets the monitor just the right slant or something like I don't know like I'm, you know, I don't know.
3623055	3639526	I mean, I have literally no context for how you assemble a one-up arcade machine, but I'm assuming there's some sort of way that they indicate what the angle of the monitor should be, and then you just put something like a guide there.
3639526	3650353	I would even use like little sticky... They have like little sticky rubber pieces that you can stick the things to help assist with, you know, lining stuff up.
3650353	3652435	That's how I would do it, at least, but...
3653116	3654860	Sounds fun.
3654860	3655421	I want to make some.
3656202	3659725	Well, then you can come over and be my task rabbit on the next arcade one-up machine I buy.
3659725	3661706	How's that sound?
3661706	3666049	Bobby in chat says, remember, not everybody is ambulatory enough to do something like a one-up.
3666049	3666309	Yeah.
3666309	3668431	No, I completely understand.
3668431	3671233	There is no shame in taking advantage of this.
3671233	3671693	None.
3671693	3672194	Zero.
3672194	3673014	No, absolutely.
3673014	3673214	Yeah.
3673214	3676216	And as Bobby says, it's gig economy, general contractor stuff.
3676216	3676817	You know what?
3676817	3683502	There is the oldest gig economy out there that I would take advantage of every time.
3683502	3684622	Movers.
3684622	3685043	Movers.
3685623	3692506	Heaven forbid the day comes when I have to move again, you will not catch me trying to move myself or trying to sucker my friends with pizza and beer.
3692506	3694626	We are all too old for that shit.
3694626	3697408	You get movers, they get that shit done.
3697408	3698888	Lightning quick.
3698888	3701249	It's the oldest gig economy that exists.
3701249	3703470	And I would use movers every goddamn time.
3703470	3704530	Could I do it myself?
3704530	3704830	Yes.
3704830	3705571	Do I want to?
3705571	3706491	Fuck no.
3706491	3706891	Sorry, Jamie.
3706891	3708632	For the record, we've never used movers.
3708632	3711213	I don't think that I could.
3711213	3713314	I wouldn't trust other people with my stuff.
3713314	3714114	You can watch them.
3715174	3716796	No, no, no, no, no.
3716796	3726908	And on top of that, part of the moving thing for me is being able to downsize while I pack.
3728473	3731694	I also understand you have 11 teen pinball machines.
3731694	3734655	And so you have a lot of high valuable stuff.
3734655	3736776	So like, I get it from that perspective.
3736776	3737756	I do.
3737756	3739597	But I don't have that problem.
3739597	3740417	I mean, yeah, sure.
3740417	3741558	I have these bad boys.
3741558	3745919	We moved the BurgerTime from the old Studio N7 house here.
3745919	3750921	And it was like my most prized possession, but I watched them wheel it up the stairs.
3750921	3753162	I just kind of supervised and did the whole thing.
3753162	3754002	But they're used to it.
3754002	3755582	They know.
3755582	3756803	But I also understand
3757423	3759666	This, $400.
3759666	3762651	One of your pinball tables, more money than that.
3762651	3773887	So I understand that, you know, but don't, I mean, are you moving the pinball machine yourself or do you have friends that are also pinball nerds that essentially know exactly how to do it and help?
3774850	3782114	Well, we would probably just have, like, the extra trucks to move more than one at a time.
3782114	3790078	But, um, and I mean, I know Dan's got friends with, like, all the moving gear and everything as well.
3790078	3800524	But I mean, the other part of it, too, is that at least for me, I guess it's kind of a little bit of denial and spitefulness on my part.
3800524	3801925	Like, no, I can do this.
3801925	3802485	Watch me.
3802485	3803406	I'm gonna do it.
3805688	3811273	I totally get the movers thing and even TaskRabbit stuff.
3811273	3814536	I try to get my wife to learn how to do anything.
3814536	3822564	For example, she recently bought a monitor riser for her computer that is very simple to put together.
3822564	3823885	It took me 30 minutes.
3825117	3826898	Like, I'm like, what if I was dead?
3826898	3827478	What would you do?
3827478	3830100	She's like, I would just hire a man to do it.
3830100	3831501	So like, there you go.
3831501	3832562	That's your clientele.
3832562	3835783	You have people that just don't want to learn how to do stuff.
3835783	3841387	They're like, yeah, I could read the manual and try it myself, but I'd rather just pay someone to do it for me.
3841387	3842207	And you know what?
3842207	3844169	I completely understand that.
3844169	3849192	Why, why, why on earth would you have a man do that when you could get a
3849972	3851633	Damn good lesbian to do it.
3851633	3852773	Why on earth?
3852773	3857955	I mean, I don't think she cares who is doing it.
3857955	3860396	She just wants somebody else to do it and not her.
3860396	3863018	So like I totally get that.
3863018	3869760	But me personally, who loves building things, why would you spare me the cancellation and nasty tweets?
3869760	3872261	I am spitting 100% facts.
3872261	3873842	100% spare me.
3873842	3877824	It's all about in the end, it's all a matter of preference, skill level and what you choose.
3877824	3878004	Yes.
3878837	3883759	Bobby, if they sent over rabbits that could build my cabinet for me, I might consider it.
3883759	3887601	That would be the coolest thing I've ever seen, but like, you know.
3887601	3898626	But I kind of am like where, Loki, what you were saying to your wifey, I'm kind of like, what if I don't have Dan around to do like that heavy stuff for me?
3898626	3903949	So I would, I don't know, for me, it's a matter of making sure I stay capable of these things.
3904332	3911955	Yeah, basically at the end of the day, to make a long story short, no one should feel guilty for hiring people to do stuff for them.
3911955	3913196	Maybe when I'm 70.
3913196	3916117	But I am still going to question, are they going to do it right?
3916117	3919359	Like, I need to just hear a little more about people's experiences.
3919359	3921660	Like, oh, they train the TaskRabbit people to do this.
3921660	3924661	Or, oh, okay, I see they have like specialty tools to help.
3924661	3928683	Like, I would like to know what's going to really give the TaskRabbit folks a leg up, you know,
3929443	3932126	The Movers is a tried and tried and true thing.
3932126	3935009	So maybe it'll be similar with TaskRabbit because they build all this furniture.
3935009	3936251	They know how to build this shit like that.
3936251	3942177	They probably watch a video online that makes them certified in this type of fix thing.
3942177	3945841	I would look for the for ratings, you know, in the end, I think.
3945841	3948164	Okay, Rama apparently said that I'm being
3949125	3951466	Bobbie is saying that Ranma answered it.
3951466	3957128	They're going to be trained by somebody at Arcade1UP and it will be assembled with wood, glue, and a drill.
3957128	3964330	That's... Bobbie, I didn't take that at face value because that sounds like speculation, especially the part where you say wood, glue, and a drill.
3964330	3967191	That actually makes sense because that's how you would assemble a real cabinet.
3967191	3967732	Interesting.
3969813	3990286	I mean, cabinets in and of themselves, like, I've watched plenty of the restoration videos, I've seen a cabinet assembled, you know, well, I've seen part of a cabinet repaired, and we did a patch-up job with wood glue, and, uh, like, this fiberglass tape, and painted right over the end, and you couldn't really tell unless you were looking at it.
3991527	4000594	I forgot to mention it during my gaming week, but I worked on my pinball table, assembling that, so I have like a tabletop one.
4000594	4012203	So I got, it was doing the playfield, or some of the playfield and putting, running LED lights through it, and then I'm going to be setting up the flippers now, the plungers for that and everything.
4013197	4020727	If you need a massive collection of LEDs and rubber bits and everything, trust me, we're loaded.
4020727	4023892	Oh no, the set comes with everything they need.
4023892	4024533	It's great.
4024533	4025294	I love this set.
4025294	4029359	I've been building it solely since last July, so it's great.
4029359	4029700	It's fun.
4030520	4032882	TigerClaw in chat, I have to address this comment, I have to.
4032882	4040107	TigerClaw in chat, it was a while ago, but said, why pay for movers when you can get movers for free, your own family members?
4040107	4042468	Just a reminder, every family is different.
4042468	4048972	And my family is mostly all people over 70 years old at this point, because I don't have kids.
4048972	4050994	I'm very clearly not going to have kids.
4050994	4055417	I can try to make Mr. Smush and Cheddar do it, but I don't think they're going to listen to anything.
4055417	4058118	So I don't really have the family members to do it.
4058118	4058279	Now,
4059019	4067825	other people that maybe are one of nine siblings, maybe you're in a different situation, which I don't know if that's you or not, but I'm just saying every family situation is different.
4067825	4071108	So, no, I don't have the family members to do it.
4071108	4073509	It's as simple as that.
4073509	4079213	Well, most of most of my my blood relations are in Alabama and Georgia.
4079213	4079834	Yeah.
4079834	4082055	So that would be hard for me.
4082055	4085057	But I do have, you know, my chosen family.
4085057	4086558	My chosen family is too damn old.
4087944	4089467	I would help you move, Rob.
4089467	4090989	Aww, that's sweet.
4090989	4093994	But you know, friends help you move, but a real friend helps you move bodies.
4093994	4096218	That's right.
4096218	4097881	Yeah, where's the TaskRabbit for that?
4097881	4099243	I mean, la la la la la.
4099243	4100525	Where's the TaskRabbit for that?
4100525	4101106	Hide the body.
4102904	4110108	But in the end, I if it's a service that that people, you know, would use, then why not?
4110108	4111089	Why not offer it?
4111089	4115131	And, you know, get the funding out of the partnership, you know, from it.
4115131	4117492	That's that's not a bad thing.
4117492	4121034	But as someone who.
4121034	4125276	I'm not going to say like I'm not like super frugal, but there are things I will not pay for.
4125276	4129719	And if it's something that I can do myself, then.
4129719	4131160	I'll just do it myself.
4131160	4131440	All right.
4132062	4134604	Well, let's move on and get to our next story.
4134604	4136966	And DarkSakura, I think it's yours.
4136966	4137947	Yes.
4137947	4143772	So speaking of people not wanting to do anything, Nintendo doesn't want to go to Gamescom.
4143772	4146915	So they're not.
4146915	4151819	Basically, Gamescom is in Cologne in August.
4151819	4155102	That's in Germany for people who don't know.
4155102	4158966	They said that this is a
4160865	4169728	One they're not going to intend, but they will have opportunities for other Switch games to be seen at other events.
4169728	4175510	And yeah, Nintendo has been at Gamescom in the past pretty consistently, but yeah, this isn't the year.
4175510	4177110	And I'll read the quote.
4177110	4182392	Gamescom is a great event, and each year we evaluate whether Nintendo should participate or not.
4182392	4186914	After careful consideration from all perspectives, we've made the decision not to be present at Gamescom 2024.
4188214	4193040	Players will have the opportunity to try out Nintendo Switch games at other events throughout the year.
4193040	4193440	And that's it.
4208889	4212793	Unless Nintendo is pulling a thing.
4212793	4219319	Yeah, even if they were going to release it in like early November or whatever, like Gamescom is only like three or four months out from that.
4219319	4222943	Like it's within that period to build the hype and all of that.
4222943	4225846	And it just I take this as like confirmation.
4225846	4226947	It ain't happening this year.
4226947	4229369	So just temporary expectations is 2025.
4229369	4229489	Yeah.
4231690	4243617	Right, because they want to, if they're going to put a shit out at March 2025, obviously they're going to, they're going to be limited to the, the last remaining Switch games that are going to be coming out for this year.
4243617	4246959	And that's what they're going to be announcing in June.
4246959	4258546	And they're not going to have anything else to show during that time because there was a quiet period when then later on, say January, February of next year, where they're like, Hey, it's Switch 2 and here's the games
4258626	4259247	Pokemon Legends
4281816	4283217	I don't know if they will.
4283217	4290500	I mean, maybe they'll do that, but like certainly they don't want to announce anything this year as well, because why cannibalize your sales for the end of the year?
4290500	4296563	You want everybody to buy a switch for the holiday and then have to turn around and buy another one.
4296563	4299824	I mean, I guess it doesn't matter at that point, because I mean, it's been out for a while.
4299824	4301245	So this does happen.
4301245	4308949	But if you're waiting until now to finally buy a switch, you're probably not in the first wave of people that would buy a switch to.
4308949	4309629	Yeah, to be honest.
4310660	4311641	Moving on, Loki.
4332540	4341348	Alright, well, despite the fact that they said they weren't going to do it, trust us, we're not going to do it, they did it.
4341348	4346934	So, Take-Two Interactive has announced massive cuts in an SEC filing.
4346934	4350997	They revealed that they're going to lay off 5% of their about 11,000 member workforce.
4355041	4366148	and they've cancelled several in-development projects totaling 140 million dollars in an effort they say is rationalizing its pipeline.
4366148	4383159	Okay, this is coming after literally a month ago when Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said they have no current plans to lay off any more employees following a cost reduction program teasing an investor call back in March.
4383159	4383699	Lies!
4384620	4386802	So many lies.
4386802	4388884	So, yeah.
4388884	4389745	Thanks.
4389745	4395730	Let's continue this process of laying off more people in the gaming industry.
4395730	4397331	You just can't trust CEOs.
4397331	4398693	You just can't.
4398693	4398813	No.
4401451	4407473	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell in the chat says there weren't plans last month, but this month, well, that is poor planning on the CEO's part.
4407473	4410214	And there's no plans this financial year.
4410214	4411355	But whoops.
4411355	4412455	Now we're going to do it.
4412455	4413936	We're going to do it again.
4413936	4414516	Oops.
4414516	4415096	I did it again.
4416775	4422898	Speaking of CEOs and making bad calls, we have a follow-up to something we were talking about just a couple weeks ago on the show.
4422898	4429280	Do you remember when the ex-Blizzard CEO, Mikey Barra, went on Twitter, or was it Twitter?
4429280	4433542	I don't know, some site, and just kind of made the comment about, I wish I could tip people.
4433542	4437084	I want to give them an extra $10 or $20 because it was worth more than the initial $70.
4437084	4438705	You know, that whole thing.
4438705	4440045	And actually, I don't know.
4440045	4441446	I didn't hate the comment.
4442386	4442526	Don't.
4466139	4482663	Right, because you know it's going to the developer then, especially if it's like one person developing something, whereas, like, I, once again, can't trust the CEOs, I would not trust that if I click the button in Assassin's Creed, whatever, that it's actually going to the developers.
4482663	4484603	And also, pay your developers better.
4484603	4486904	Why am I paying the developers?
4486904	4487064	Yeah.
4488186	4494293	Well now this week we have some of the follow-up roasting that's happened of said tweet.
4494293	4500961	IGN video director Destin Lejari, I hope I said that right, says in a very kind of
4502421	4511686	just kind of puts the nail on the head with this comment says, I think the billion and trillion dollar companies can handle compensating their employees fairly, instead of relying on a tip from me.
4511686	4516969	Because it's not like my money goes to the combat designer or level artist, it goes to the corporate piggy bank.
4516969	4519551	That's exactly what I've been commenting in a way.
4519551	4524674	First, as I said, take it out of fucking Bobby Kotick CEO or take take it out of his fucking severance package.
4525154	4526935	Tip the employees with that.
4526935	4529297	That's where it's deserved.
4529297	4531519	Indie developers, maybe I'd feel a little differently.
4531519	4537623	But again, I think with an indie developer, if you love a game enough, buy a copy for a friend or help spread the word.
4537623	4540365	That's almost more powerful.
4540865	4542966	Or support them on the next game that they put out.
4542966	4543946	Like, that's the thing too.
4543946	4547887	It's like, like, there are ways... He's like, well, I wish there's a way to support these guys.
4547887	4548648	There is!
4548648	4550328	You buy more of their stuff.
4550328	4557051	Like, when they put out a new title, you buy another product from that developer because you want to support them.
4557051	4557831	That's how you do it.
4557831	4560312	Not tipping them because they did their job.
4560312	4560652	Because then,
4561978	4563820	It will get twisted so badly.
4563820	4568544	If this ever made it into like AAA games, whatever, it would be just like constant.
4568544	4570727	Hey, hey, hey.
4570727	4576852	It's like, you know, have we not used, like to quote Mike Ybarra, have you not used phones before?
4576852	4578594	Do you not know what the app's saying?
4578594	4579595	Hey, rate us.
4579595	4580356	Have you rate us?
4580356	4580756	Do you like us?
4580756	4583579	I don't think that was him that said that, but, but I, who cares?
4583579	4584099	You know what?
4584099	4584339	I get it.
4584339	4585841	They're all the same CEO to me.
4586421	4591265	All making the same stupid statements and the same stupid opinions.
4591265	4598230	You know, so yes, we've used mobile apps where they constantly nag us to do stuff like, hey, have you raided us?
4598230	4600452	Raid us, you know, blah, blah, blah.
4600452	4604916	That's essentially what we have here is they're saying, oh, hey, pay us more money.
4604916	4607498	We'll promise it's going to those employees.
4607498	4608899	Oh, wait, we can't give to the employees.
4608899	4609900	We just laid them all off.
4609900	4610000	So
4611294	4612594	You know, I guess we'll just have to keep it.
4612594	4613575	We'll give it to our CEO.
4613575	4614835	He did a great job.
4614835	4616215	Saved us so much blame.
4616215	4617096	Make it that number.
4617096	4619316	Give it to the investors.
4619316	4621977	Make the line go up.
4621977	4625218	I just, I don't know.
4625218	4630059	We just, we need to take a moment to go back to a simpler time when we weren't talking about tipping.
4630059	4636981	You know what most, did Howard Scott Warshaw make a tip for making Yars Revenge, which is you can play 1001 different ways.
4639466	4662123	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4662123	4664665	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4666263	4673768	And sorry, I think a little bit of the audio from this game got through, but what is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
4673768	4677590	It's Tokidensho Angel Eyes.
4677590	4683654	It is a Japanese fighting game that was developed and published by Tecmo.
4683654	4690818	It was released in the arcades in June 1996 and had other re-releases.
4690818	4693660	It's basically a 2D all-female fighting game.
4697951	4707396	It's in the same vein as stuff like Asuka 120%, Pretty Fighter X, Variable Geo.
4707396	4710137	And it's kind of like a mixed bag of a game.
4710137	4717000	I mean, there's like, you got a biker, you have a volleyball player, schoolgirl, a ninja girl, one who fights with a teddy bear.
4717000	4721582	And if I'm right, I think she also has like a pretty wicked infinite combo.
4724284	4733957	But you have your punches and your kicks and you have your special moves and different techniques, but what's unique to the game is something called the reverse combo correction.
4733957	4736380	That's what fans have called it anyway.
4736380	4737141	And, um...
4740372	4743375	It's just a really interesting thing.
4743375	4749922	So like, basically, you know, if you're in a fighting game, your combo attacks are chained together and the damage decreases.
4749922	4755587	But in this one, the damage increases the more combos you chain.
4755587	4763815	So you can basically do instant kill combos, just like I was saying with that one character.
4766587	4774173	And then there are homing jumps, where if you jump, you are thrust directly into your opponent.
4774173	4781619	And then for the PlayStation port, there was an arcade mode versus mode training mode and story mode.
4781619	4783920	So yeah, it's a pretty...
4785202	4786742	Pretty interesting game.
4786742	4788303	I'll be getting into a little bit more on that.
4788303	4797366	So basically, it started development in 1994, right after Ninja Gaiden 2 on Neo Geo was cancelled.
4797366	4801887	It was one of the first games to feature all female characters in a fighting game.
4801887	4807149	You know, like I mentioned, you know, Variable Geo, Pretty Fighter X, those games.
4807149	4814331	And then some of the games, some of the characters, sorry, were created in pixel art, and some were pre-rendered 3D models.
4815131	4820914	So it was like an interesting combination.
4820914	4829840	The PlayStation version also has 2D versions of three of the characters that are unlockable.
4829840	4831380	But like I said, it originally came out
4832541	4834942	in Japan in June 1996.
4834942	4839265	It was ported to the PlayStation and released on December 11, 1997.
4839265	4849350	There was a drama CD called Toki Denshou Drama Album and a soundtrack CD on November 12, 2008.
4849350	4859675	The PlayStation version was re-released to PSN, PlayStation Network, to their game archives, and you could download it for PSP and PS3.
4861177	4870734	On October 20, 2022, it was added to Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archive series for the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.
4870734	4872577	I can tell you right now the Switch version is like $8.
4874962	4880944	As for how well it went over, Famitsu gave it 22 out of 40.
4880944	4897128	They basically were noting that it was really unique to mix the pixel art and polygon characters, but that one thing that was getting a little awkward is that it was in this sort of vein of other games that had a lot of aerial combat in the game.
4897128	4898268	So...
4901789	4904030	It was basically given middle of the road.
4904030	4907591	And I mean, and it's a it's a fun little game.
4907591	4916554	But I thought that it was a notable one due to maybe other things we may be discussing tonight.
4916554	4922336	And of course, onto my boobs.
4922336	4923136	And that's it.
4923136	4925457	All right.
4925457	4927977	I don't think I ever played this, sadly.
4927977	4929438	Well, you can get on the Switch for eight bucks.
4930925	4932006	Is it worth $8?
4932006	4933267	Be honest.
4933267	4933988	It'll be fun.
4933988	4935689	Yeah, it's a fun way to waste some time.
4935689	4937211	All right.
4937211	4937771	There it is.
4937771	4940634	Classic game of the week.
4940634	4941455	All right.
4941455	4944117	Let's travel on to some rapid fire news.
4944117	4947780	We'll talk about some other stuff that happened in the industry relatively quickly.
4947780	4952965	And then we're not too far out from getting to your calls and your chat comments in the listener roundtable.
4952965	4954306	We'll get to that in just a minute.
4954306	4955727	But first, some rapid fire news.
4955727	4955948	Loki.
4956721	4961445	in the least surprising news that everyone's ever heard.
4961445	4965148	Amazon's Fallout series is getting a second season.
4965148	4969492	Because you know, that's what popular TV shows tend to do.
4969492	4974976	And yeah, so it is gonna happen.
4974976	4975497	I can't wait.
4975497	4980521	I know people who have two minds about that.
4980521	4983523	Dan said he wasn't really that excited about it.
4983523	4984504	Interesting.
4984504	4985565	Did he like the first season?
4987574	4989435	Well, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
4989435	4992377	He'd watched the first season and didn't think it was very exciting.
4992377	4995119	Okay, I gotcha.
4995119	4997161	Why can't we?
4997161	5006687	And then in surprising news, I guess, Keanu Reeves is going to be playing the voice of Shadow the Hedgehog in the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie.
5006687	5007328	Whoa.
5007328	5009609	Yeah, I saw this earlier.
5009609	5012351	That's interesting.
5012351	5013012	Not surprised.
5013012	5014553	I mean, he does stuff like that.
5016098	5016998	Yeah, why not?
5016998	5019239	Nobody's gonna have a problem with this casting.
5019239	5020460	Super cool.
5020460	5021400	Exactly.
5021400	5027403	And, um, you know, I hear Knuckles is supposed to be pretty good, which I think that's launching this week.
5027403	5030184	Maybe next year.
5030184	5033005	Friday, I want to see it, but like, I haven't got a chance to see it.
5033005	5036546	But yeah, the first two Sonic movies, like, surprisingly good.
5036546	5041948	Like, I'm, I have yet to see them excited.
5041948	5043569	All right, DarkSakura.
5045974	5054437	So there is, you know, remember I brought up the arcade archives earlier?
5054437	5062119	Well, a game that is being added to that is Newman Athletics, which came out in 1983 by Namco.
5062119	5074483	It is a futuristic sports game that had different weird events going on and never came out to any home system, but did come out on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan.
5076100	5083407	And it's, it actually had a sequel called Mock Breakers Newman Athletics 2 in 1995.
5083407	5093397	This is going to be on the Switch and PS4 on April 25th, which is four days from the day of this podcast recording.
5093397	5093757	All right.
5094930	5103633	And to follow up to something we talked about on a previous episode of the show, the game Octopath Traveler has returned to the Nintendo eShop.
5103633	5108334	It made a lot of waves when it disappeared from the eShop for a hot minute, but it has returned.
5108334	5114136	In a tweet, I almost said a squeet because it was Square Enix who tweeted it.
5114136	5122059	In a squeet, Square Enix wrote, Octopath Traveler is now available to purchase on Nintendo Switch eShop once again.
5122659	5124119	Thank you for your patience.
5124119	5133301	No words on what changes were made, but I'm pretty sure it was that whole publisher and probably the splash screens in the beginning were probably updated to reflect that.
5133301	5141882	But you can now buy that game all over again on the eShop if you were wanting to do that and somehow haven't already, I guess.
5141882	5146223	All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates of some games you can pick up.
5146223	5150584	If Octopath Traveler is something you already picked up, you can get some new stuff this week.
5150584	5151664	We'll start with the U.S.
5151664	5151904	Loki.
5153024	5162287	We have Iodine Chronicle 100 Heroes on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5162287	5170230	Tales of Kinzera Zao on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5170230	5178313	Assault Suit Leonos II Saturn Tribute on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5179093	5185425	Another Crab's Treasure on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5185425	5187789	That sounds funny.
5187789	5189412	Another Crab's Treasure?
5189412	5190795	Yeah.
5190795	5191817	Just the name sounds funny.
5195775	5221008	Megaton Musashi, Wired, PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5 Saga Emerald Beyond, PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, iOS, Android Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaba, Sweep the Board, Nintendo Switch Manor Lords, PC
5223277	5239909	SandLand on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5 and Top Spin 2K25 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5239909	5240189	That's it.
5241601	5253185	All right, before we get to the Japanese releases, I have to address this in chat because I made that pronunciation mistake and I said a squeet and DarkTetsuya said I like squeet over skeet TBH.
5253185	5258187	Okay, yeah, look, because I'm not 12 years old, I don't call blue sky posts skeets.
5258187	5260208	Okay, I call them bleets.
5260788	5262549	because I just think it sounds better.
5262549	5268051	And it makes me think of the nickname of the Dead by Daylight killer, The Blight, because everybody will go, it's a bleat.
5268051	5270672	So I thought it was the Blort.
5270672	5271152	The Blort.
5271152	5271572	I like that.
5271572	5272473	I've heard of bleat.
5272473	5279335	So but either no matter which way you slice it, you know, I would like more people to come to Blue Sky.
5279335	5283477	And I feel like if Oh, the posts are called skeets is the first thing you're telling them.
5283477	5286038	I'm not sure a lot of professionals are going to make their home on Blue Sky.
5286038	5286258	So I
5286658	5290621	I prefer to use bleat, a post because that's a post.
5290621	5292923	Yeah, that's what I was calling it was just a post.
5292923	5298066	But if they have to have it, I don't think they need any stupid little name unlike Twitter.
5298066	5299027	All right.
5299027	5303851	But now because Twitter changed their name to X, it's you know, it's Twitter.
5303851	5305412	It's a sheet.
5305412	5306032	It's a shit.
5306032	5307994	So when you're posting on Twitter, you're posting sheet.
5309960	5311060	You're not tweeting, you're shitting.
5311060	5312041	You're shitting.
5312041	5313521	All right.
5313521	5315222	Uh, let's see, moving on.
5315222	5319784	Let's talk about Japanese release dates, including for the Nintendo Switch.
5319784	5322705	Of course, Aiden Chronicle is coming out in Japan as well.
5322705	5325126	It's a worldwide release on the 23rd.
5325126	5327727	Otherwise, we get to a bunch of releases on the 25th.
5327727	5335791	And yeah, there's quite a few this week, including Saga Emerald Beyond is also out in Japan this week, which reminds me, I really disliked the Saga series, but maybe this one will change my mind.
5336631	5343013	Demon Slayer, Kimetsu no Yaiba, Sweep the Board is also out this week on the 25th.
5343013	5352496	Kemono, Kenomonimichi, Girlish Square comes out in a regular and limited edition, as well as Assault Lanos 2 Saturn Tribute.
5352496	5361019	I'm like, is that like, the, the, the, but no, this is some type of, what do you call these things?
5361019	5361279	Tech
5362819	5364780	Robotech thing.
5364780	5365160	Mech.
5365160	5365721	Mech games.
5365721	5366321	It's a mech game.
5366321	5366921	Mecha game.
5366921	5368682	Yeah, it's one of those.
5368682	5370243	Um, let's see.
5370243	5377406	And then the most interesting named game, Mom Hid My Game Collection comes out on the Nintendo Switch.
5377406	5378147	That's right.
5378147	5384210	You can play one of four exciting mini games including Mom Hid My Game, Mom Hid My Game 2,
5385919	5393386	Hide and Dance and My Brother Ate My Pudding in which the plot is you ate your sister's pudding and now she's mad.
5393386	5396068	Don't let her catch you.
5396068	5398670	I think I seem to remember Hide and Dance.
5398670	5404175	Actually, I feel like these were all like interesting little Internet games at some points.
5404175	5409139	They've compiled these because you hide and dance a bizarre rhythm and dance game played in secret.
5409139	5411381	Dance your heart out without mom finding out.
5414904	5415484	Okay.
5415484	5416685	Oh my God, there's a trailer.
5416685	5417106	Hold on.
5417106	5417986	Hold on.
5417986	5418767	Hold on.
5418767	5420028	There's a trailer.
5420028	5422429	And now I need to see this whole thing here.
5422429	5422750	Hold on.
5422750	5426312	Let's, uh, I'm looking at the other screen right now in which we're seeing the footage.
5426312	5439341	And for those in the podcast, it's a very, um, cartoonish, it's very bright, light blue background that is showing some of the different game modes in which like, for example, it looks like mom hid the game on top of the window.
5439341	5441262	So you have to find the ladder.
5441262	5441523	Yeah.
5441523	5443064	And now you're flying a drone.
5443944	5447307	The Wii instruction graphics that they have.
5467236	5468457	The Nintendo Switch.
5468457	5472920	Library of Ruina comes out in Japan as well on the Nintendo Switch.
5472920	5476823	Guitar Life Lesson 1 is also out in Japan this week on the Switch.
5476823	5478484	That's a lot of games coming out on the Switch.
5478484	5479805	How about the PlayStation 5?
5479805	5482887	Of course, Aiden Chronicles will also be out on the PlayStation 5.
5482887	5488451	And then a game called Sand Land from Bandai Namco comes out in Japan on the 25th.
5488451	5490572	Saga Emerald Beyond is also on the PlayStation 5.
5491573	5499400	Behelogar is also out in regular and limited or limited edition on the PlayStation as well this week.
5499400	5502923	So quite a few games on the PS5 as well.
5502923	5503964	How about Europe, DarkSakura?
5505946	5521989	On the 23rd for the three consoles, I just say the three, is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Wrath of the Mutants, and then also for PlayStation and Xbox, Topspin 2K25 Deluxe Edition, because people really like tennis.
5521989	5528570	On the 25th, we have Railway Empire 2 for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox.
5528570	5530071	The rest of these are on the 26th.
5530071	5531891	For PlayStation, we have Stellar Blade.
5534012	5536853	Lunar Lander Beyond for PlayStation and Switch.
5536853	5542256	For PlayStation and Xbox, we have Top Spin 2K25.

5550761	5555324	PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, Contra Operations, Garuga.
5555324	5562048	Happy Fun Land on PlayStation, and then Sand Land on PlayStation and Xbox.
5566599	5575524	SGO100 Matt reminding in our chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network saying Sand Land is the Akira Toriyama game, likely one of the last few games he worked on.
5575524	5577685	Okay, I did not make that connection.
5577685	5578886	So thank you.
5578886	5580066	All right, just a few more stories.
5580066	5581767	And then we'll get to the listener roundtable.
5581767	5582948	So first, we'll go to Loki.
5584386	5597813	Uh, yeah, this is, uh, interesting, something I wouldn't have expected, but apparently there is a Golden Axe animated series that is being, um, worked on at Comedy Central.
5597813	5598813	So... Very strange.
5598813	5604456	They said it's a ten episode animated comedy series, um, on Comedy Central.
5604456	5609759	Like, I... Because when I think of Comedy Laugh Riot, I think of Golden Axe.
5610780	5623851	Yeah, I mean, for me, like, what would be pretty funny is if they did like the whole red versus blue type of thing, just with like golden axe sprites in like the game or something like that would have been kind of funny.
5623851	5627114	But yeah, I don't know ways to make it funny.
5627114	5631137	Like, you know, with the right writers that can really make anything funny.
5631137	5632458	Maybe it'll turn it.
5632458	5633439	Yeah.
5633439	5634240	Yeah, it's coming.
5634240	5635521	So apparently it's
5638084	5656105	So, essentially, they said that it is being produced by CBS and the folks that worked on Star Trek Lower Decks and Solar Opposites, as well as Joe Chandler of American Dad.
5656105	5657426	Okay.
5657426	5657867	I'll check it out.
5658595	5660397	I mean, it's worth a shot.
5660397	5663560	I mean, you know, obviously your Lower Decks is good.
5663560	5664681	Oh, yeah, Lower Decks is great.
5664681	5670868	And unfortunately, it's now confirmed that season five is going to be the last season because in Star Trek, apparently five is the new seven.
5670868	5675612	This Discovery is only getting five seasons and now Lower Decks is only getting five seasons.
5675612	5676393	Strange new worlds.
5676393	5676774	Look out.
5676774	5679036	But that seems to be one of the most popular series right now.
5679036	5679637	So who knows?
5679637	5680397	Who knows how that'll do?
5682669	5683670	Lower Decks is great.
5683670	5685333	Lower Decks brought us the Moopsie.
5685333	5689178	That's the best thing I've seen in a show in a long time.
5689178	5694185	Just look up Moopsie, Lower Decks, M-O-O-P-S-Y, and just, it's the greatest thing.
5694185	5694465	All right.
5696901	5699182	And Moopsie is heavily inspired by Pokemon.
5699182	5701583	Tell me that is not a fucking Pokemon inspired thing.
5701583	5704164	So yes, it is related to video gaming.
5704164	5709306	Okay, um, let's talk about Baldur's Gate 3 and a potential sequel.
5709306	5719950	We actually knew a little bit about this because there were rumblings that the studio, Larian, was not going to be working on a successor to Baldur's Gate, that they were working on things.
5720890	5739640	It is confirmed, and they have said very plainly in a community update on Steam this week, Larian Studios said, we won't be introducing any new, or excuse me, any major new narrative content to the story of Baldur's Gate 3 or its origin characters and companions, nor will we be making expansions or Baldur's Gate 4.
5739640	5743803	So they have pretty much said, no, no, no.
5743803	5747825	Like, it is what it is, which is why people liked Baldur's Gate 3.
5747825	5749466	It's a complete story, right?
5749466	5749586	So.
5750086	5752268	Yeah, I guess.
5752268	5759095	They did say, we're currently working on two new projects, and we couldn't be more excited about what the future has in store.
5759095	5762018	They'll share more information later down the line.
5762018	5769446	Know that even as our focus turns to these new games, the sensibilities that brought you Baldur's Gate 3 are alive and well here at the Larian Castle.
5770046	5783337	I don't know if we're going to pull it off, but looking at our narrative, visual, and gameplay plans, I think what we're working on now will be our best work ever, which is what they're required to say, but it is still, considering how well Baldur's Gate 3 did critically, is still very, very, very interesting.
5785836	5804415	Apparently Sven Vinke, the director at the studio, had said previously that there was a planned Baldur's Gate 3 DLC and a sequel, but the studio did drop those plans, partially due to constraints imposed by Dungeons & Dragons mechanics from the 5th edition.
5804415	5805376	It's very interesting.
5807128	5809751	But they do say, we've done our job.
5809751	5812333	It's a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
5812333	5816518	So let's pass the torch to another studio to pick up this incredible legacy.
5818220	5819561	There's a lot to pick up on there.
5819561	5821082	There will be a Baldur's Gate 4.
5821082	5824483	Oh yeah, there absolutely will be a Baldur's Gate 4.
5824483	5826064	Larian's not making it.
5826064	5833388	Somebody else is going to make it, and so people will rightfully have some concerns, I'm sure, knowing that it's a different studio doing it.
5833388	5837850	I'm all for giving them a fair shot, especially if the new studio commits to
5839111	5842972	doing a complete game and making it really worth a $70 game.
5842972	5850014	I think the earlier they can kind of confirm that that's the creative direction for Baldur's Gate 4, the more people will get excited about it.
5850014	5854615	Meanwhile, I think there's going to be a lot of people that are ready to eat up whatever Larian puts out next.
5854615	5859316	They've certainly earned all that critical praise they're getting, so it'll be very interesting to see what happens next.
5859316	5866938	But no Baldur's Gate 4 or DLC from Larian, and there will not be any further content for Baldur's Gate 3.
5866938	5867458	It is what it is.
5868663	5870044	All right.
5870044	5874746	Well, there will be maybe a little more content for episode 1001 here of Orange Launch Radio.
5874746	5883990	If we get some good questions or phone calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord, if you want to join our discord server and hang out in the green room, we'll take some calls.
5883990	5886131	We do also chat throughout the week.
5886131	5890694	We oftentimes get stories that are inspired from the posts you guys make in our discord.
5890694	5897477	So thank you all who keep the conversation going on throughout the week on our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5898017	5899579	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
5910955	5916299	I'm just really happy for the Arcade Archives.
5916299	5924765	I really have been happy with just how consistently they've released games and the big collection that they've built up for us.
5924765	5927367	Well over 100 at this point.
5927367	5927868	400 plus.
5927868	5929349	Oh my god, it's that many?
5930029	5930290	Wow.
5930290	5930890	Hold on.
5930890	5932413	I had something that I was reading.
5932413	5941045	Now, this is back from March of this year, but the Arcade Archives Nintendo eShop set a Guinness World Record.
5941045	5941726	That's incredible.
5943033	5952180	And okay, so it's their 7th anniversary on Switch, with over 400 games released on the console.
5952180	5953481	Hold on, I'm double-checking.
5953481	5961567	For 366 consecutive weeks, there has been an Arcade Archives release on the Nintendo eShop.
5961567	5964629	This was actually recognized in 2019, when the total was 113.
5968171	5983702	and they continued through the pandemic and so now on their seventh anniversary of being on, this was as of March again, 403 titles were out as of March 3rd.
5983702	5993789	Looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Darktosia points out a quick note on the Sand Land trailer, we were talking about that game, apparently they went with Sandstorm by Darude for the music.
5995695	5996956	Of course they did.
5996956	5999677	Thank God somebody finally went the obvious route.
5999677	6002358	Like this, you just, that's what I expect.
6002358	6004198	Thank you for meeting my expectations.
6004198	6007980	Because a lot of times, you know, they don't do that, but thank you for meeting the expectations.
6007980	6008920	Okay.
6008920	6010801	ssj100mat asked this question.
6010801	6012702	It's a deep cut, but I'll explain it.
6012702	6018304	So ssj100mat asks, has Sacramento recovered from Klay Thompson throwing bricks at the Arco Arena?
6018304	6018544	Okay.
6019324	6020405	Here's the story behind that.
6020405	6021945	I didn't even know anything happened.
6021945	6022946	Here's the thing.
6022946	6027588	So he didn't that that's a player on the team and he did not throw anything.
6027588	6029809	But apparently some players were throwing.
6029809	6031150	Were they actually throwing bricks?
6031150	6035912	Or I thought they were throwing like chicken wings or something at the Golden One Center, which is the new arena.
6035912	6037433	Fans were throwing them on the floor.
6037433	6039994	But here's the thing, because why?
6039994	6041275	Why not eat them?
6041275	6041775	I don't know.
6041775	6044036	But because fans fans get weird at sports games.
6044036	6046598	But here's here's where that story came from, because
6047338	6051564	They are shoving AI up our ass everywhere they can.
6051564	6056612	I even noticed on Facebook and Instagram, there's not even a search bar anymore.
6056612	6060157	There's just ask the meta AI or whatever the fuck it is.
6060157	6060617	And look, I...
6061889	6063210	I've gone over this AI thing.
6063210	6065611	I don't think all AI is bad.
6065611	6068932	I think there are definitely some great uses for AI.
6068932	6075816	And you know, as a tool, as you would think of other type of generative tools that have helped Photoshop come a long way and so forth.
6075816	6078117	I see AI as an evolution of that.
6078117	6080458	I do not need AI shoved up my ass.
6081398	6083799	and who else is trying to shove it up your ass?
6083799	6087481	Twitter, of course, which thankfully is a website I don't use anymore.
6087481	6096165	But for those that do use it, because they fired everybody that was curating the news headlines, they're now relying on AI to do it.
6096165	6103728	And AI wrote the headline as Clay Thompson from the Sacramento Kings was the one throwing the bricks.
6107369	6111630	because AI only, it only goes so far.
6111630	6115211	It can't fucking make decisions like a human can.
6115211	6120192	It doesn't know right from wrong like a human does usually and so on.
6120192	6123893	So I just, we need to stop relying so heavy on AI.
6123893	6127514	Like everybody just wants AI to be a thing so fucking bad.
6127514	6131315	Nobody, it's, I'm literally going Jurassic Park.
6131315	6134095	Everybody is so consumed with doing it.
6134095	6136156	Nobody is stopping to wonder if we should.
6139645	6153778	I have to say something out of the book for the character he played.
6153778	6155360	Best sensible advice.
6155360	6158082	I only wear black or grey because I can always find something that matches.
6159838	6167621	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf says for non basketball people throwing a brick means throwing a ball that never hits the basket.
6167621	6168341	Oh, okay.
6168341	6173623	I was cuz I was like, did Clay Thompson throw the first brick at Stonewall?
6173623	6174684	Is that what they're trying to say?
6174684	6175904	No, no, it's none of that.
6175904	6176844	No, no, no, no, I agree.
6176844	6178685	I agree with podculture.
6178685	6181006	The only AI I want is in a black Trans Am.
6182921	6187363	And remember, only we only want kit, we do not need car.
6187363	6187843	Thank you.
6187843	6190985	So again, I'm not I'm not here to just completely shit on AI.
6190985	6195487	I'm completely here to shit on companies forcing AI down our throats.
6195487	6201829	Like again, AI as a generative tool is how we're gonna get 8k textures and games and things like that.
6201829	6210713	Like we're gonna have to have some sort of generative AI to us as a tool to help develop these types of things in you know, games and so forth.
6210713	6211734	But um,
6212774	6216055	relying on it to report the news.
6216055	6218936	Only a dumbfuck billionaire could make that call.
6218936	6220157	Oh, look.
6220157	6221057	Oh, look.
6221057	6222417	Oh, look.
6222417	6224998	Oh, look, another dumbfuck billionaire.
6224998	6231560	That should be that should be what that should be what this decade just how it's summarized in the history books.
6231560	6233321	Oh, look, another dumbfuck billionaire.
6234082	6240233	Is it a problem that the covering for an accelerator, you know, falls off and can get jammed in the accelerator?
6240233	6244140	Is that a problem on my brand new futuristic piece of crap truck?
6248843	6251845	I hope that man is about to lose.
6251845	6253266	He's already lost money on Twitter.
6253266	6254006	I know it.
6254006	6261269	I hope he's about to lose even more because I'm hearing people are getting laid off at Tesla, which, you know, for people trying to make an honest living.
6261269	6264491	And so I'm not going to take delight in that.
6264491	6270194	So I do, it's, you know, people trying to make an honest living and okay, you did what you had to do.
6270194	6271895	There aren't a lot of jobs in Reno.
6271895	6273735	Sometimes you got to take one at the Tesla factory.
6273735	6275336	I get it.
6275336	6276557	So I feel bad, but
6277853	6289580	It's hard for me to hold the tears back knowing that Elon Musk will be personally impacted, as personally impacted as possible.
6289580	6290541	Anyway.
6290541	6296044	Oh, speaking of just one little thing that I think is just so beautiful.
6296044	6301147	So you know how the Twitter acquisition was because Twitter was starting to lose money, right?
6301147	6301327	Right.
6302754	6313381	Um, apparently there is speculation now that the company's value is only around 4 million.
6313381	6318044	Out of the 400 and something, out of the 44, he paid for it.
6318044	6321066	Good.
6321066	6322447	Watch it die.
6322447	6327070	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says a lot of Tesla layoffs are in the understaffed overworked service centers.
6327070	6329231	A lot of service appointments were canceled last week.
6331598	6332759	Thanks for watching!
6354462	6354822	That's fine.
6354822	6357184	We had such a big show last week, they can't all be big.
6357184	6369976	And the news has just been in a weird cycle lately, especially I think with kind of like, I don't want to say like PlayStation 5 and Xbox series have like gone through its cycle, but it feels like we're like kind of on the edge of like a new cycle.
6369976	6371597	And then we know that Nintendo is putting something out.
6371597	6377583	So it's just a very strange time in gaming right now, I gotta say so.
6377583	6380005	But we're always happy to talk about the things you want to bring to the table.
6380385	6381546	You can always send us an email.
6381546	6384770	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.
6384770	6387273	I skipped it because I think I knew we didn't have anything.
6387273	6388334	I didn't think so.
6388334	6394762	And for the record, I finally started putting stuff in the junk folder server side, so hopefully it'll start getting filtered out.
6394762	6394982	Oh, good.
6397066	6399768	SG100 Matt wants to point out he didn't pay for it to be clear.
6399768	6403652	He got a lot of money from foreign investors, but he is on the hook for paying them back though.
6403652	6404412	Well, you know what?
6404412	6405213	Yep.
6405213	6408616	And those investors fucking got what they deserved.
6408616	6410398	How about another stupid decision?
6410398	6412920	Do I feel an ounce of sympathy for the investors?
6412920	6413801	Absolutely not.
6414961	6415982	Absolutely not.
6415982	6422207	Do I feel an ounce of sympathy for people that underwrite bonds for a former president that they're probably going to lose the money on?
6422207	6424068	Absolutely not.
6424068	6427071	Absolutely not.
6427071	6428532	Let them eat cake.
6428532	6429313	You know what?
6429313	6430694	You know what?
6430694	6431454	If me in 2020
6435336	6439939	or sorry, not 2020, whenever Shit for Brains got elected.
6439939	6441420	Oh, 2016, yeah.
6441420	6442261	Yeah, thank you.
6442261	6445303	I can't brain, you know what I've been through.
6445303	6455970	But if me in 2016 could have seen where this was going this year, I would have just endured a lot better.
6455970	6456590	Not stop the simulation.
6456590	6459252	I mean, I wouldn't have wanted it to happen at all.
6459252	6461574	I wouldn't have wanted it to happen at all, but
6463234	6465285	2016 me is vindicated today.
6467375	6468116	All right.
6468116	6469037	Anyway, that's it.
6469037	6469737	We're going to wrap up.
6469737	6470738	We're done.
6470738	6472480	Thank you all so much for tuning in this week.
6472480	6473200	We appreciate you.

6476243	6479506	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6479506	6482088	So tell a friend or two, help us spread the word.
6482088	6488494	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or YouTube, wherever you found this show goes an awful long way.
6488494	6493438	Yes, I'm going to start pimping YouTube more because with the closure of Google Podcasts, we are now available on YouTube.
6493818	6513912	as a podcast I'm sorry the video is not available on YouTube at least not today we still that is a special extra special perk for our Twitch subscribers and you know we're not we're not taking as as we went into it we never took anything away this podcast has been free the entire fucking time we've been doing it it's always and it's gonna stay free
6514372	6520196	but a little something extra would be the the fun video that we do and you can see it free if you tune in live.
6520196	6525839	But otherwise you can you can use your Prime subscription over on Twitch to see the actual video recordings.
6525839	6528060	At this time, we're not planning on putting it up on YouTube.
6528060	6531082	YouTube is just static image of the audio recordings.
6531082	6534484	So that's that's that on that.
6534484	6534944	The breaks.
6536641	6540023	Anyway, let's go around and get folks' final thoughts, and we'll wrap it up.
6540023	6545126	DarkSakura, I know you're going to be doing some Cult of the Lamb, I think you said tonight, so change it up a little bit.
6545126	6549508	Yeah, I did so much Dead by Daylight that I'm like, you know what?
6549508	6550889	I'm going to do something chill.
6550889	6554951	But I put it up to people to vote on, and people voted for Cult of the Lamb.
6556252	6563994	come to you know, I will be more than happy to invite people into my, my little cult.
6563994	6567835	And there's a lot of Twitch integration with that if you people out there weren't aware.
6567835	6569955	So it's worth checking out to be a part of it.
6569955	6571256	Yeah.
6571256	6572516	Alright, so I'll see y'all then.
6572516	6575897	But in the meantime, later taters.
6575897	6576117	All right.
6576117	6577377	Have a good one.
6577377	6578937	You too.
6578937	6581358	All right, that takes me to Loki and your final thoughts tonight, Loki.
6582929	6587672	Just go check out Turbo Kid on Steam.
6587672	6588973	It's 20 bucks.
6588973	6591394	It's worth it.
6591394	6594657	My final thought is I hate back pain.
6594657	6595837	Getting old sucks.
6595837	6596378	Don't do it.
