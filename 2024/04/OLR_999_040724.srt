1
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,525
[SPEAKER_06]: British reward season continues!

2
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:16,689
[SPEAKER_06]: America has seen most of its 2023 award shows take place, and now the BAFTA awards continue their slate as well.

3
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:18,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And 4,000 Brits couldn't be wrong!

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,632
[SPEAKER_06]: The most iconic gaming character is, herself, a Brit!

5
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Most iconic doesn't mean longest lasting, most selling, most consistent, it only means most iconic.

6
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And who wouldn't celebrate a Brit as a Brit?

7
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:29,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat your heart out, GameFAQs.

8
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:34,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this poll and the rest of the week's gaming news.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,

10
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

11
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:46,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:53,821
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back tonight live April the 7th of 2024.

13
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:58,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode number, get this, 999 of our show.

14
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:04,008
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time ever that our show can be expressed with merely three digits.

15
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:04,548
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

16
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week, kind of a big deal.

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,090
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to that in a little bit.

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,591
[SPEAKER_09]: First off,

19
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:10,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Three digits do not contain us.

20
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:15,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there she is, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

21
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Jamie.

22
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

23
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:18,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I am Rob Roberts.

24
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:18,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

25
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:19,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

26
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,589
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing this week?

27
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:22,290
[SPEAKER_03]: You are shit.

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

29
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:23,931
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

30
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:26,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So not my birth name, believe it or not.

31
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:28,473
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, some people think my parents really were that cruel.

32
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:29,574
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't talk about that.

33
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:29,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

34
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,035
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't we don't talk about that.

35
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:40,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say that you share a name with one of my late uncles who I tolerated more than the other from that side of my family.

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently I share a name with a politician overseas that got in a lot of trouble too.

37
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:46,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, I don't know her.

38
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:47,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I've none.

39
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,906
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no business of mine.

40
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:50,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

41
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:53,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So she does a more common name than you'd think.

42
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

43
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the name on most social media websites.

44
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:02,214
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am the Rob Roberts, except not actually at the rubber.

45
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just at Rob Roberts.

46
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:07,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only place I'm not is Twitter, but I don't care about that site anymore.

47
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:08,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Although

48
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:09,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I have

49
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:37,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I should write a tweet and do some good old self-promotion for those people that didn't follow me to Blue Sky, which is a lot of people.

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I can kind of be like, Hey, remember that little show that I used to talk about all the time on this website for like 40?

51
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're going to be a thousand.

52
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:51,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's the only reason I still do anything on there is, you know, like promoting the show.

53
00:02:52,957 --> 00:03:07,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Well it was funny because I actually went through the last few tweets I wrote on that website before I... I had left one other time when Wish.com Lex Luthor bought the website the first time I left for like four months.

54
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But I came back because I was like, I'm really only hurting myself being gone.

55
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:20,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Then when the more lucrative alternatives like Blue Skies showed up and you know, Mastodon, things like that as well, I left again, but I didn't announce my departure.

56
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:25,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, you know what, I know people get annoyed at the whole like, this isn't an airport, you don't need to announce your departure.

57
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,563
[SPEAKER_09]: So I never really said anything.

58
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I just changed my bio and I left.

59
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so where was I going with that?

60
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:37,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was going through the last tweets I'd written for like, maybe a good two months before I left.

61
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,929
[SPEAKER_09]: They were all self promotion.

62
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, I'm doing this show.

63
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Come see this show.

64
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing this thing.

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Come see this thing.

66
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:54,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was I wasn't writing anything, probably because at that point, I was already kind of starting to use blue sky more and more at that point for whatever, like personal tidbits I wanted to say.

67
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway,

68
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:59,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, that's that's that's social media.

69
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:01,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to our other host.

70
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:08,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we've got to introduce here as well who has been here with us for 999 weeks now say hello to Techmaster Loki.

71
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:09,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Has it been that long?

72
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, it has.

73
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably longer, I think.

74
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:13,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

75
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:23,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't feel like, you know, it's funny because on, you know, with the show turning a thousand, there's a lot of people in my personal life that have been asking, like, isn't your show turning like a thousand soon?

76
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, isn't, wasn't that coming up?

77
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, it's going to be like in two weeks or next week we're turning a thousand.

78
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,647
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, wow, is it, that's like 20 something years, right?

79
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it feel like it's been that long?

80
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm kind of like, it hasn't, it hasn't, you know?

81
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:36,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

82
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:43,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I think, well, I think COVID and the pandemic and all of that really fucked our sense of time for a lot of things.

83
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:52,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you guys feel about that, but to say the least, it really feels like two plus years of our life just were like taken.

84
00:04:52,682 --> 00:05:01,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Like one of those, what is, what is the movie with the, was it the princess bride with the thing that like this machine will suck off 10 minutes of your life forever?

85
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:01,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

86
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:05,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It COVID felt like that, but two years worth of work.

87
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:05,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

88
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,889
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my day job.

89
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so so in some ways, no, it doesn't feel like it's been that long.

90
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,811
[SPEAKER_09]: But then you kind of think about like, I was thinking about it today, when this show started in 2002.

91
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:24,692
[SPEAKER_09]: So June of 2002 was the first episode of this show, we were live on Life is Five for a long time, we went right into podcasting as soon as that was the thing.

92
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:33,455
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the scope of things, which is interesting, because, you know, for a minute, we were doing two shows, because we were doing the live show that was really just about music gaming.

93
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:35,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we were doing the the

94
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:43,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Portable to Go Edition, the podcast that was really about like, you know, all the video game topics, which is basically kind of took over the rest of the show.

95
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,440
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what the show is now.

96
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I was, it was episode around, I think, 168, that we made the switch, around 168.

97
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:55,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the vast scope of things,

98
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,967
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't that long.

99
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:04,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Only about 16-17% of the time we've done OLR was not this format that we're in now.

100
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:06,034
[SPEAKER_09]: That is really weird to think about.

101
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:10,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I feel like the old show that we did, we did that for a very long time.

102
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep feeling like, you know what I mean?

103
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:19,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, when everybody would come to the house, with the music game people would come over, like it was almost like a party every week and all that.

104
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:22,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I really feel like that lasted for years.

105
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:24,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it kind of did.

106
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:31,713
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, I don't know why, but like thinking back, I feel like that part, like I go back, like how long I felt like that was like at least half the run of the show.

107
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:32,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And it really wasn't.

108
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:35,034
[SPEAKER_09]: It was only like not even 20%.

109
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to bring this up.

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, apparently we have shattered a hype train record in chat.

111
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,818
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are so kind.

112
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all so much.

113
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:43,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I usually don't

114
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:52,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like to interrupt the podcast because we are a podcast that you can download on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube now in place of Google podcasts and all that good stuff.

115
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's worth mentioning.

116
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:55,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, no, it is.

117
00:06:55,484 --> 00:07:02,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't usually usually but yeah, when you guys are shattering records and doing these things that are really above and beyond, we have to say something.

118
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure even the podcasters understand.

119
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when we got to say something.

120
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:07,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that Loki you did 999 bits.

121
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,389
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't have to do that.

122
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And then like five episodes.

123
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Five gift subs from Deft, five gift subs, oh my god, you did like, no, nine gift subs from Loki, five gift subs from Bob.

124
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to do 999, that'd be ridiculous.

125
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:21,859
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be a bit much.

126
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we've had that many people that have ever watched this channel, but that's still, that's still amazing.

127
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all so much for the generosity.

128
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,046
[SPEAKER_09]: That's incredible.

129
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:31,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Just really appreciate that.

130
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,288
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what next week has to bring.

131
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:36,932
[SPEAKER_09]: But I am going to say this, we're going to get into our kickoff topic tonight, but I am going to say this,

132
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:40,984
[SPEAKER_09]: don't set your expectations super high.

133
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:46,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've said this for some time, because everybody's like, well, what guests are you going to get for your 1000th episode?

134
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:53,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, as if they would answer the fucking phone, like they're not going to answer the phone for this little thing that we do.

135
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,593
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, it's okay.

136
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:56,614
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and that that's fine.

137
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:59,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are gonna say, well, you don't know unless you ask.

138
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:00,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is that is true.

139
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely agree with that.

140
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:06,741
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, why should it be anything but what it's always been?

141
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:12,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should we do something completely different just for the sake of a special number?

142
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the Drag Race finale.

143
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's we keep it to the family.

144
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:17,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

145
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:22,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's it's one of those things where we'll we'll do some little little things.

146
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:23,908
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be some little things.

147
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:24,816
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

148
00:08:43,698 --> 00:09:07,948
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway um so it's not a surprise for you but uh all right anyway uh let's get into games let's do it let's talk about video games and gaming culture as we do here i guess this first story is a little more gaming culture but i thought this was interesting looking at the way technology is really changing and so forth um let's just get to it loki tell us about this very interesting thing that's crossed paths this week

149
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:25,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently device manufacturer Roku has patented a new technology to essentially allow them to use your HDMI to push ads on devices that don't necessarily have ads.

150
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for example, imagine if you're playing your Xbox or something like that and you pause the game, the TV itself would detect that the game is paused and it throw up an ad for you.

151
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I see this as...

152
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:46,164
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just killing your brand if you do that.

153
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:53,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, honestly, like, if people find out that, like, this brand of TV... And Roku isn't necessarily a brand of TV.

154
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:02,254
[SPEAKER_07]: It is... A lot of TVs have Roku built into it, like my TV, which is a TCL has a Roku streaming device built into it.

155
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clunky.

156
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:04,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

157
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:06,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It works okay.

158
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:12,380
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of these devices that are getting more smart, whether you want to or not.

159
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect example, um, my monitor died today.

160
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought a new one.

161
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,222
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Samsung monitor.

162
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:27,123
[SPEAKER_07]: It has Netflix built into it, and, you know, it's got Bixby built into it, and... What the fuck's a Bixby?

163
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:27,984
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a Bixby?

164
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:36,706
[SPEAKER_07]: A Bixby is a voice assistant, so you can... Can you play the whole... You can talk to your monitor and ask it to do things, to which I'm like,

165
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,526
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm hooking a computer to this.

166
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:41,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would I want to do this through a monitor?

167
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:46,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would I watch Netflix through a monitor when I have a computer that can play Netflix?

168
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:48,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's silly.

169
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

170
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:50,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

171
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one Bixby.

172
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,940
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one Bixby for me.

173
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's Bill Bixby, the original Incredible Hulk.

174
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,587
[SPEAKER_07]: But it came with a remote.

175
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:10,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a remote for the monitor, which is nice because I can switch the inputs that way without having to, like, fumble trying to find the button on it.

176
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:23,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's a lot of unnecessary things that they try to put on there because I'm sure they get kickbacks from these different, like, you know, Netflix and the streaming platforms to include this on here.

177
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,401
[SPEAKER_07]: They get a kickback for it.

178
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that aside, yeah.

179
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:33,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling if this is going, the route, if they go this route...

180
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:35,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if I set off your stupid

181
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:02,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I just assumed not that many people would have that one.

182
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:06,327
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the other one from Amazon.

183
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:11,411
[SPEAKER_07]: That one is also a part of this as well, so I did not say that one on purpose.

184
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to turn that off.

185
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,843
[SPEAKER_07]: They have it built into the monitor.

186
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:20,924
[SPEAKER_07]: By default, it's on.

187
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:25,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, you can shut it off with a switch.

188
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,830
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to fumble with settings or anything to do that.

189
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,312
[SPEAKER_07]: But the remote has a microphone on it.

190
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,173
[SPEAKER_07]: The monitor has a microphone on it.

191
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:35,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It has these stupid lights on it that change whenever the

192
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,949
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason, it's like, you know you're not a TV, right?

193
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:39,989
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a monitor.

194
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I got you as a monitor, not a TV.

195
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:50,171
[SPEAKER_07]: If I wanted a TV, I would have a much larger display compared to what I have now for the price.

196
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:57,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun fact, I had a Commodore 64 branded monitor that they sold to Commodore 64, and I actually used that in college.

197
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,575
[SPEAKER_09]: because it had RCA inputs on the front of it.

198
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:06,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually used it as my TV for my VHS device and my Super Nintendo.

199
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So we used to play Super Mario Kart on my monitor, my Commodore 64 monitor.

200
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could get that maybe there's a scenario where these like the Netflix and everything built in could be like, oh, I'm in a college dorm and stuff like that.

201
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:27,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe I have a laptop and I'm living with a roommate in my college dorm and then I leave with my laptop, but my roommate wants to watch Netflix.

202
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And we only have this monitor and so it's like...

203
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:57,665
[SPEAKER_09]: that's such a narrow scenario with people having phones and whatnot like sure okay but anyways that aside uh the roku stuff yeah that kind of sucks that they're doing that i'm laughing at bobby saying i also used my commodore 1541 monitor i thought that was the disk drive was the 1541 or was that the 1540 that might be anyway i also used my commodore monitor in college as my tv i had my laser disc player hooked up to it and a surround sound stereo setup

204
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:03,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But on this 14 inch Commodore monitor, that is incredible.

205
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:03,602
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

206
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:10,784
[SPEAKER_09]: E3VL says they're going to sell for cheap on Black Friday Tigerclaw says that Roku killed their brand when they're forcing people to accept this new terms of service with no way of selecting.

207
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,245
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't use the device unless you accept.

208
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, worst arbitration after the fact.

209
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:34,545
[SPEAKER_09]: People are definitely going to think about the TVs that they're buying.

210
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,346
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's be real.

211
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:44,931
[SPEAKER_09]: The super mondo cheap TVs that people buy on Black Friday, or whatever big sales that stores are doing, are going to be the TVs that have this stuff built into it.

212
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:49,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Now my question, I would be very curious how it's detecting that the game's on pause.

213
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I would assume that motion stops

214
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,617
[SPEAKER_09]: for a certain amount of time, like all motion stops for a certain amount of time on the screen.

215
00:14:55,617 --> 00:15:04,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But you said Xbox, and I don't know how many of y'all know, but I know the Series X at least does this, and I'm pretty sure the Xbox One did this as well.

216
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:09,863
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the game is paused for a certain amount of time, Microsoft has their own thing that starts happening.

217
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:18,306
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not ads, but it'll cycle through gamer score achievements, like achievements you're really close to earning, I think achievements you recently earned.

218
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:22,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It may show other stuff about the games that you've been playing and things like that.

219
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:25,710
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, it's not I wouldn't call it ads.

220
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,212
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's something that I would say for most people, it's the preferable use of something like this.

221
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:37,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it showing you relevant data to you know, whatever game you have on pause right now or other games on your Xbox platform?

222
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:39,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Bobby says that is on Xbox One as well.

223
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:39,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

224
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:40,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was because it's the same.

225
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,979
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of the same front end system on both.

226
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:44,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

227
00:15:45,080 --> 00:16:03,819
[SPEAKER_09]: but um and i i honestly think i've seen tvs that do this where you can have them in like a low power mode where they just dimly lit and they show the weather forecast for your area news headlines stock market stuff for people that are into that and things that i think most people would go okay

228
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,701
[SPEAKER_09]: That's useful.

229
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:06,801
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not invasive.

230
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,182
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, you know, kind of neat.

231
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,443
[SPEAKER_07]: But Roku doesn't do that.

232
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:09,743
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they don't.

233
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:19,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Roku advertises streaming service stuff, which... So essentially with Roku... To something that nobody's looking at, really, hence why it's on pause.

234
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:19,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

235
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:31,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things with Roku, so it says Roku lost over $40 million in 2023 in hardware sales, but made $1.6 billion in ads and services for that year.

236
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why they're going that route.

237
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:38,613
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you know what?

238
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:41,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what, here's the compromise with that.

239
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:52,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Then if you want to provide these displays for free and have them ad supported in that sense, okay.

240
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:55,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's worth it, you know?

241
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:58,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, it's it's you get what you pay for.

242
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And Roku is kind of a cheap brand.

243
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:06,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, when you pay less, you're going to get this because that's where their money's coming from.

244
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:22,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So but I mean, if they think that they're going to like, you know, like the only way I could see this being like really, really bad is if they do one of these forced arbitration things where essentially they release TVs, like say during Black Friday or something like that, people purchase them, then they patch it in later.

245
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:24,103
[SPEAKER_09]: to do that.

246
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:26,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, gross barf.

247
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:38,454
[SPEAKER_09]: But and then then they disable if you don't accept the new terms of service, which I don't know, I feel like ought to be that ought to be an anti consumer thing that ought to like, especially, especially if they're trying to change it after you've already bought it.

248
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:49,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And like the base thing on there, it should allow you to either revert to the base IO, or not iOS, because that would only be one brand, but base OS, or, you know, accept the terms of service of the new one.

249
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:51,905
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that would be yeah, to me, I mean,

250
00:17:54,184 --> 00:18:00,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if this is such a big problem, eventually you'll have hackers trying to, you know, attack this.

251
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:01,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't even think of that.

252
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Like people hacking the TV.

253
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:04,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

254
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,651
[SPEAKER_09]: They hack all these devices to play Doom on it.

255
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:07,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure.

256
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's Oh, yeah.

257
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even think about people.

258
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:11,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

259
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:14,335
[SPEAKER_09]: They make their own OS's for these things.

260
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:17,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to think that, you know, maybe

261
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:22,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go so far as to say just because they patented it doesn't mean they're going to do it

262
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:46,618
[SPEAKER_09]: But they want to make sure that if anyone can do it, they do it because they thought of it or whatever it is.

263
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:52,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So but there is definitely, you know, there's already going to be this consumer backlash with this and the negative press and all that.

264
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,782
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's very possible they may say, we're not we're just, you know, protecting our ideas.

265
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:01,804
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to actually use this or whatever, although.

266
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:07,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you never know, someone will make an in-between device that plugs into your HDMI that essentially tricks it into thinking that there's

267
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:09,867
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff on the screen.

268
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can't wait.

269
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:14,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait for when it triggers incorrectly.

270
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,510
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm very curious.

271
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,611
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it looking for to know that your game is paused?

272
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:22,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, if it's just looking for a still screen, it won't work on Microsoft.

273
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,074
[SPEAKER_09]: It might work on PlayStation.

274
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:31,338
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to say even there, when you pause, don't you get it might depend on how you pause it.

275
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:37,501
[SPEAKER_09]: If you pause by going to the crossbar menu, then you'll have the little animated ads that play on the crossbar thing.

276
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:59,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't imagine a world in which anybody thinks this is like, okay, like, as far as like, being okay with ads, like, I get annoyed anytime I see ads on there, even if they're on there, like menus and stuff like that, like, like, because you're essentially you're making money after you've already made your money from me, you know, it's, it's clearly I get it.

277
00:19:59,345 --> 00:19:59,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's

278
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:05,496
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even really subsidized because the displays aren't that expensive to manufacture.

279
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,997
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not losing a ton of money.

280
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:14,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're saying, oh yeah, we lost $40 million on hardware, but we made $1.6 billion.

281
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:21,101
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're clearly making a lot of money on top of the sale price of the actual device.

282
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do have a problem with that.

283
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:38,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pointed out in our chat that probably not a lot of people listening to this program are on Roku's because Tigerclaw says, for those who own a Roku TV, there are ways to watch Twitch on it since they don't have the official app anymore.

284
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,405
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess there's workarounds, but no official Twitch app.

285
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize that.

286
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:44,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some, like the Switch lost the Twitch app, right?

287
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:49,507
[SPEAKER_09]: In some places because, you know, probably some of the upgrades Twitch has done behind the scenes, but that's interesting.

288
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:56,969
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, I guess I guess we'll see if anything comes of this.

289
00:20:56,969 --> 00:21:04,956
[SPEAKER_09]: But this could be very interesting because I don't know about y'all, but I do tend to pause games for a long period of time while I go do something else, like use the restroom or fix a snack or something.

290
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:09,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I don't want to come back to, you know, some, especially if it's an ad with volume.

291
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it shouldn't have volume, though.

292
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,142
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be.

293
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:15,685
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think most of their like pause menu ads are just still ads.

294
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:27,241
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah okay that's a little less invasive as long as it like instantly clears up when i get back i don't know what effective ads they could show like that but whatever i'm not i'm not the one paying to advertise on those platforms

295
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,281
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

296
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:34,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's Orange Right says to unpause HDMI, shout McDonald's into your remote.

297
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:35,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

298
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:38,085
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to shout a brand name to unlock it.

299
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,125
[SPEAKER_07]: They did that.

300
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Swear your loyalty to a brand.

301
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:42,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely ridiculous.

302
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:44,528
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, like that.

303
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:46,329
[SPEAKER_07]: You joke about that.

304
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:48,910
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a thing that they have done.

305
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:56,373
[SPEAKER_07]: They have had ads and to skip it, you had to type a keyword or something like that to get it to skip by.

306
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: So like,

307
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:59,756
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a thing that already exists.

308
00:21:59,756 --> 00:22:01,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Gross.

309
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:02,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate it.

310
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,302
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

311
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:10,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week with or without ads, probably mostly without.

312
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,911
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, we'll go to you.

313
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:12,552
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week?

314
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:15,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the usual.

315
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:17,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Dead by Daylight.

316
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I played, well, I didn't do my, um, my Friday stream because it was fuck it Friday where the ballet people get together and, uh, drink and play games and talk shit about people and do drunken choreography.

317
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

318
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:41,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but I did play some Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my own.

319
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:45,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually beaten the game and now I'm doing all the after game stuff.

320
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's pretty fun.

321
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:57,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I did, uh, uh, Dracula XX, Nocturne in the Moonlight, or as we got it, Symphony of the Night, but I'm doing the Saturn version that

322
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: has the graphics and everything all optimized for what the Saturn was actually capable of instead of the rushed pile of shit we got.

323
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:15,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has all the voice acting from the PSP version and the same translation.

324
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those were my usual ones.

325
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:23,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been busy otherwise with stuff.

326
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:25,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly getting rid of shit.

327
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:31,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, we'll go on over to TechMasterLoki.

328
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's been Minecraft this week.

329
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:40,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I released another episode and I've been just kind of, I don't know, doing what I do.

330
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:44,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, between episodes, you know, it's like, I don't know, I can't focus on anything.

331
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just building farms now.

332
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's what I've been doing.

333
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:50,643
[SPEAKER_07]: My basement's a mess now.

334
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:53,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, that's pretty much, pretty much what I've been doing.

335
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:55,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

336
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:57,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, let's see my gaming week.

337
00:23:57,223 --> 00:24:03,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, a lot of the usual stuff I've talked about on this program before Final Fantasy 14, of course, played a little bit of Overwatch 2.

338
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:09,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to say the little April Fool's event they did in Overwatch 2 is actually kind of cute.

339
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:12,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, they did this whole thing that was like a re rebalancing is the thing.

340
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:16,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And they changed players' abilities to make them very silly.

341
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,551
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I really like is that they changed.

342
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if you've ever watched or played Overwatch,

343
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:30,440
[SPEAKER_09]: You know when characters use their ultimate abilities, they're gonna say things like, you know, let's say when Cassidy uses his ult, he says, it's high noon.

344
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Like most people know that one, right?

345
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause that's, that's how you know to hide.

346
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:36,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't get in his area where he can shoot you.

347
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:41,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in the April Fool's mode, he'll go, it's two or three o'clock in the morning.

348
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they change, they change it up.

349
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's, I know it sounds ridiculous the way I'm saying it, but like, it's so funny as you're playing it.

350
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:49,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say these silly things.

351
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:50,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

352
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:50,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I laughed.

353
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:51,456
[SPEAKER_09]: April Fools' Day prank

354
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:14,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's, there's that.

355
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:24,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And even in the normal game mode, because you can play either one, you're not forced into the like rebalanced mode, you can play a normal game, but they still use their lines.

356
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And they all have big googly eyes.

357
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:31,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So they did all the characters with big googly eyes, which is just really silly, but it's just for a week.

358
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like it.

359
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,361
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun.

360
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:43,225
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm kind of honestly, if this is the direction that Blizzard is going to get to go with under Microsoft, although granted, this has probably been planned for quite some time, but I'm I'm into it.

361
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:44,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's I think it's fun.

362
00:25:44,605 --> 00:25:46,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been playing a little bit of that.

363
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:49,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, you know, I love to play some mobile games.

364
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:58,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Pokemon Go today because there was a community day thing going on for Bagon or Salamence, which evolves into and I got my four star

365
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:03,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a perfect Salamence, except it's not shiny.

366
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:06,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess a shiny one would be extra perfect.

367
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did get a three star shiny, which is cool.

368
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:15,254
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like I got everything in that department I need to get in Pokemon Go, as far as the collection goes.

369
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:20,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also been playing a bit of Monster Hunter now, which of course is kind of the newest Niantic game.

370
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:23,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that one plays really well with other people.

371
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:31,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have, you know, friends that I know through Ingress, and we play Pokemon together, we walk Pikmin days together, we kind of play a lot of this stuff.

372
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:32,725
[SPEAKER_09]: We play Monster Hunter now together.

373
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we were playing some of that.

374
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the multiplayer in that runs, you know, really well.

375
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,290
[SPEAKER_09]: For what it is, I like Monster Hunter now quite a bit.

376
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I just, it is a real grind.

377
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:46,093
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to a certain point where it becomes very obvious.

378
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:48,834
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a frickin grind.

379
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:54,535
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do understand like, okay, well, like, you know, these games are set up so that you can't beat them in a week.

380
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:59,477
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you got to take your time because otherwise, you know, people won't continue to engage with them.

381
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:01,897
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still like it well enough for what it is.

382
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:06,318
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are pretty yeah, Mike Defton chat says just like a regular mon hun.

383
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:10,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much but like, somehow worse.

384
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So just keep that in mind.

385
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, that's honestly pretty much it for my gaming week.

386
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't jumped into a lot of new stuff yet.

387
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:21,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, as I mentioned at the end of Bobby's show, my friend and I are looking for like a dungeon crawler to jump into.

388
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:27,870
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't want to really play Diablo, and we tried Grim Dawn for a hot second, and that was okay, but I don't know.

389
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,711
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Baldur's Gate?

390
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, maybe like the original?

391
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:33,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like the new one?

392
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,245
[SPEAKER_00]: The new one?

393
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:40,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's a little bit I like I like the more like loot dropping type of things like Baldur's Gate.

394
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to play it.

395
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:43,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't like that one multiplayer.

396
00:27:43,614 --> 00:27:44,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried doing it.

397
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:45,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Minecraft Dungeons?

398
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:50,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually thought of that one as I was looking like, you know, obviously I asked Google, you know, what are some of the top ones?

399
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:54,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And I saw Minecraft Dungeons is like, Oh, yeah, that one's kind of fun.

400
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:55,368
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that we'll see.

401
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:55,648
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

402
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:56,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some good ideas.

403
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked during Bobby's show and got a few other ideas, too.

404
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:01,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So I forgot about Lost Epic, too, is one to check out.

405
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

406
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:03,518
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

407
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, oh, and Orange Rite talked about Fortnite in chat.

408
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play a little bit of Fortnite festival.

409
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know they've been adding a lot of songs to that they add like seven new songs a week to that mode right now.

410
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:19,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm still never gonna pay the price they're asking to download the songs.

411
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:22,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But to go in there and look at the dailies free rotation and play a handful of songs.

412
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:24,144
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, there's always something in there.

413
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:25,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually go, huh, that's neat.

414
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:26,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm play that one before.

415
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,085
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of fun.

416
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:38,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Rite says in chat, Fortnite Festival makes me want to get back into Rock Band because it, it, this is Rock Band, Fortnite Festival is Rock Band 5.

417
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And you may not like that.

418
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:41,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And you may say, but it's missing this.

419
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:43,457
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't.

420
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:47,918
[SPEAKER_09]: But Epic Games bought Harmonix for this.

421
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:51,379
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Rock Band 5, whether you like it or not.

422
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:51,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

423
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:56,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, hey, at least there's like a lot, a lot of songs in it.

424
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:57,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but I get it.

425
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,950
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

426
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,735
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to play, you want to play the old school one that really was rock band.

427
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:03,536
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

428
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:07,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, uh, let's get into some more headlines and talk about what else is going on in gaming news.

429
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, go to you.

430
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:10,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

431
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:27,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a new movement now being led by Accursed Farms, is a YouTube channel run by Russ Scott, who is trying to basically push for video game preservation.

432
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:28,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for example,

433
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:47,388
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that they are focusing on right now is The Crew and you know because a lot of these online games that get put out that or even not necessarily online games but games that nowadays require an online connection for them to function even single-player games where

434
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:49,486
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

435
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:12,543
[SPEAKER_07]: have legislation be put in place to basically disallowing these companies from leaving these games in unplayable states.

436
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:24,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the things that they're focusing on, one, of course, being in a playable state, two, allowing folks to basically, you know, guaranteeing that they're not going to be

437
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,101
[SPEAKER_07]: The above should apply to games that have sold microtransactions to the customers.

438
00:30:51,277 --> 00:31:05,490
[SPEAKER_07]: things as part that you've purchased and the above cannot be superseded by end-user license agreements because a lot of these companies like to skirt their responsibility by writing into it a ULIST.

439
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:12,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now they were saying that they they're pushing folks to kind of file

440
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:22,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess grievances with there's a French, I think a consumer body.

441
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really sure what it is.

442
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:30,329
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know they are in France, and they kind of, you can do that outside of the country.

443
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:33,072
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also works because Ubisoft being a French company,

444
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:38,956
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, certainly they would be the ones that are most overseeing them.

445
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:45,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not necessarily just Ubisoft, but I guess starting with this would be a good place to kind of look at.

446
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:54,504
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, eventually there's going to be other games that are going to die like this that you may have bought, you know, content in or whatnot.

447
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:00,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly like, for example, Suicide Squad.

448
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:05,918
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, right now, I know you have to connect to the Warner Brothers servers for that.

449
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:08,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's an offline version of that.

450
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you have to be connected to that.

451
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:18,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And so eventually, probably very soon, when that game dies, remember, it's a $70 game, you're gonna have $70 paperweight.

452
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:27,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So they need to be able to patch that so that it is available offline.

453
00:32:40,760 --> 00:33:07,653
[SPEAKER_09]: you you were screwed we have to accept that this is the status quo that companies are able to do this to us because legally you know they make you press the y button up front before you're ever allowed to start playing and do all this you accept the terms of service and therefore you know you the consumer should know these things before you drop 70 on a game so the onus is on you and I kind of like this approach of and I don't know how well it's going to work because I know our fucking government doesn't function or should

454
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:08,613
[SPEAKER_09]: and more.

455
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna tell it like it is.

456
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:43,284
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is because we never fucking get anything done in America because our government doesn't fucking function for any of us.

457
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:50,708
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is we look to Europe to set the standards for a lot of this stuff and they have done it for things like privacy.

458
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:55,711
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done it for things like these sorts of consumer acts, and they just did it for AI.

459
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,632
[SPEAKER_09]: because we have failed to do this.

460
00:33:58,632 --> 00:34:00,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So yet again, here we go.

461
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:05,154
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this is a brilliant idea to target folks over there to say, you know what?

462
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:06,334
[SPEAKER_09]: No, fuck that.

463
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,715
[SPEAKER_09]: You should not be able to have a terms of service.

464
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: You as the person making this product to sell that product need to meet these certain conditions.

465
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:15,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And look, I get it.

466
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:19,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Servers online ain't free.

467
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:19,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

468
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:20,980
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

469
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:36,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, if a server is going to get shut down, what you ought to do is release that software, release that program that will allow me to run my own server if I want to, or someone else to run their own server, or whatever it takes.

470
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,970
[SPEAKER_09]: That onus should be on you.

471
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:39,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I think it did.

472
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they took PSO2 down.

473
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:42,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Bingo.

474
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:42,733
[SPEAKER_09]: You know.

475
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:43,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Blue Burst.

476
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:44,594
[SPEAKER_09]: PSO2 is still up.

477
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:46,475
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're talking about Blue Burst, yeah.

478
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:47,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Burst, yeah.

479
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just don't make your game rely on that anyways.

480
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:50,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get it.

481
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:53,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things are unavoidable if it's like an MMO or something like that.

482
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,423
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the very least, they could patch it in so that it's offline.

483
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:03,988
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are interested in this and participating... They could put a big sticker on the box that says, this game does not function without internet.

484
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:04,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they should.

485
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:05,289
[SPEAKER_07]: They should do that.

486
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't.

487
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So stop... Of course, not that the box matters anymore in this era.

488
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:12,234
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that is not really forward thinking, but yeah.

489
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:15,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're interested, stopkillinggames.com.

490
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy enough to remember, and you can go there and they will give you step-by-step instructions for different countries.

491
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:20,758
[SPEAKER_07]: How is that not taken?

492
00:35:20,758 --> 00:35:22,259
[SPEAKER_09]: How is that not taken?

493
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:25,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no one wants to stop killing games, they gotta kill games.

494
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It is taken by those people.

495
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:32,424
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just saying, how was it not taken until this point?

496
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of impressed, to be quite honest.

497
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:36,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

498
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:36,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

499
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:37,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

500
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:40,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So there and I love they have targeted this game.

501
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:40,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

502
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki was kind of saying that it's all right here.

503
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,547
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's pretty awesome.

504
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:46,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Take action.

505
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:47,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Select your country of residence.

506
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:47,888
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

507
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:50,449
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I do in the US?

508
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:50,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

509
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:52,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the options you can take.

510
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Spread the word.

511
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:53,610
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

512
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we did that.

513
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,910
[SPEAKER_09]: We spread the word.

514
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not social media, but podcasting is kind of social media, right?

515
00:35:58,672 --> 00:35:59,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Contact the FTC.

516
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:00,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

517
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:01,333
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

518
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And they tell you how to do it.

519
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:06,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they really just walk you through this.

520
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:10,657
[SPEAKER_07]: The GCCRF, that would be the France body.

521
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:13,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember what the actual acronym stands for.

522
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It stands for the France's Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control.

523
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Rolls off the tongue.

524
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:28,184
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, hopefully they'll be able to take action on that stuff.

525
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:29,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Priorité Moyenne Hotte

526
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:47,997
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to be in France.

527
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,058
[SPEAKER_07]: You can you can do it anywhere.

528
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,959
[SPEAKER_07]: They take in.

529
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,360
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm sorry.

531
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because you have that.

532
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

533
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:55,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you have that here.

534
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,582
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was just I was looking like, what can they do?

535
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is one of the options.

536
00:36:58,443 --> 00:36:59,784
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the others as well.

537
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:06,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, but I I would just assume it's going to hold more weight or whatever if more people from France do it.

538
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:07,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not.

539
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:11,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Apprenez simplement le français.

540
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

541
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:12,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Just learn French.

542
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:15,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Oui, oui.

543
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:15,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Non.

544
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

545
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to tease, right?

546
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I have mad respect for people that can speak multiple languages.

547
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I have tried.

548
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:28,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And my Spanish is very bad.

549
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:34,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do not, you know, it's it is what I mad respect for people who can speak multiple languages because it's a very difficult thing to do.

550
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:36,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So but anyway, that's great.

551
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I speak a little bit of French.

552
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:45,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Props to these folks at StopKillingGames.com.

553
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,832
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to do something about this.

554
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be fascinating to see how this develops.

555
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:53,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

556
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:53,654
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

557
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:56,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Def says I still got it wrong.

558
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:57,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Moi aussi.

559
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:01,476
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

560
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:12,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on and talk about, well, this is, you know, a nice, as opposed to, you know, all this stuff about games that are closing down and, you know, losing the server support forever.

561
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:15,627
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of neat what's happening with Xbox.

562
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:24,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a move that the new president of Xbox, Sarah Bond, has done, is setting up a new team that is going to be dedicated to game preservation.

563
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:29,536
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as forward-thinking compatibility.

564
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:44,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically what happened, there was a report by Windows Central that got some emails, intercepted some emails from Microsoft, where Sarah Bond, who's the president of Xbox, was talking about some different topics.

565
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:48,542
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those topics was that there is a new Xbox under development.

566
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,363
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what we all know,

567
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:52,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, hardware.

568
00:38:52,384 --> 00:38:55,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hardware is under development for a very long time.

569
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,507
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 6 is under development.

570
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:01,629
[SPEAKER_07]: The day the PlayStation 5 was released.

571
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:02,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

572
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,271
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are making a new Xbox.

573
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:10,394
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the email, Sarah Bond says it is the biggest technical leap ever in a generation.

574
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:11,315
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

575
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:11,995
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little.

576
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:12,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

577
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,596
[SPEAKER_09]: They say that every time.

578
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:13,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

579
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:14,937
[SPEAKER_09]: But OK, sure.

580
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: They're you know, because I'm sure a lot of us are sitting here going, yo,

581
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:33,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Series X, PlayStation 5, modern PCs, they really push the boundary on graphics and what's possible like what's gonna be but it's like we say that every time we say that every time on this fucking Super Nintendo or even the regular Nintendo playing Super Mario Brothers 2.

582
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:35,650
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like a cartoon.

583
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Graphics are never gonna get better than this.

584
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:44,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they remastered Super Mario Brothers 2 for the Super Nintendo and it still looked really good.

585
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:45,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And so on and so on.

586
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, they haven't done it again, but that's all right.

587
00:39:48,759 --> 00:40:10,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, also, as part of this email, and this is the part that's getting people's attention, Sarah Bond said in the email that a dedicated team is being set up to future-proof the digital Xbox game library across future hardware paradigms to, quote, build on Xbox's strong history of delivering backward compatibility.

588
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:17,557
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really funny because I'm sure we all remember a time when Xbox was very like, no, we're not doing anything with it.

589
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:18,557
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a priority for us.

590
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:19,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We're never going to do it.

591
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,878
[SPEAKER_09]: That those are the Don Mattrick years, right?

592
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:28,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when Don Mattrick got the boot, and then that what was the first thing they started tackling once they got once once he got the sack?

593
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:33,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, because Don Mattrick was there for the launch of the Xbox One.

594
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:34,529
[SPEAKER_09]: So I take it.

595
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:35,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I take it back.

596
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:47,276
[SPEAKER_09]: It was still during his years, but there was definitely some changes at the helm that had them going this direction, because they said very much at one point they weren't going to do backwards compatibility.

597
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they then they they did it.

598
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:54,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, yes, I would say Microsoft in many ways is kind of leading the way.

599
00:40:56,201 --> 00:41:02,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, Sony PlayStation 5 plays PlayStation 4 games and kind of does 3-2-1 through cloud and stuff.

600
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:06,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they've got their own kind of workaround, but it's different, right?

601
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:10,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's, you know, Microsoft's in a great position in that department.

602
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:24,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Also part of the email, kind of unrelated, but Diablo 4 has become most prominent on Xbox versus any other platform since the game started inclusion on Xbox Game Pass, which was just a couple of weeks ago.

603
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:40,990
[SPEAKER_09]: that kind of surprise I wonder if it's concurrent players as of now because that really surprises me it's still even over PC after the PC launch but if we're talking about oh the concurrent players from last week then yeah I'd believe that so interesting

604
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:58,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, pretty neat that they're doing a team to look at that and the fact that you know when they when we talk about like the forward as well, that means when they release a new platform, making sure that the new platform will still be able to play all the older games, which I think is is really cool.

605
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is more that will be shared.

606
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:07,285
[SPEAKER_09]: supposedly on the Xbox showcase, which will be June 9th, 2024.

607
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:10,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been the old E3 timeframe.

608
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:18,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So Xbox is still planning on doing an announcement in that kind of, you know, in the spirit of what used to be E3 week around that same time.

609
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:19,609
[SPEAKER_09]: So that could be very interesting.

610
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:26,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll put some new games on backwards compatibility, which they said they weren't going to do, but this whole thing kind of opens that door.

611
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:30,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe, you know, one game that's still not backwards compatible.

612
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of the DDR games.

613
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,905
[SPEAKER_09]: All the DDR games from Xbox and Xbox 360 still not backwards compatible.

614
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:40,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And I imagine there's like a weird music licensing thing in there.

615
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:41,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

616
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But would it be nice if those games would come back?

617
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:45,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, yeah, we'll see.

618
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:53,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Questbuster in chat says, as a tangent to Diablo 4, I will always accept a Diablo 4 tangent because I really like that game.

619
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:59,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Word is that the PTR or Public Test Realm fixes they have in store for Season 4 are being received very well.

620
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:06,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the fact that they even did a PTR is a huge improvement in my book, because all of the number-crunching nerds are going to be in there.

621
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And I say that with all due respect.

622
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:14,848
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was not for you number-crunching nerds, I would not have my builds on websites that I can just follow to do what I want to do.

623
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:28,575
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're all in there and apparently the fact that they can test and show what is completely imbalanced versus something else through all that hard testing I think is going to be very helpful for Season 4 as it is.

624
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:30,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really looking forward to it.

625
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:32,197
[SPEAKER_09]: The launch of Season 4 got pushed back though.

626
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:41,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be in mid-May now instead of in a couple weeks because they wanted that extra time to be able to implement PTR feedback, which I think is a great call.

627
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So stay tuned for that.

628
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:45,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on, DarkSakura, let's go to you.

629
00:43:47,335 --> 00:44:00,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we had, we had mentioned about this before, um, that the, uh, Nintendo Live, uh, 2024 was not going to be taking place in Tokyo because of, uh, some threats.

630
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:13,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, according to, uh, newspaper Kyoto Shimbun, which is, you know, the newspaper out of Kyoto, um, they've arrested, uh, police have arrested the suspect who was linked to those threats.

631
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:14,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

632
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:19,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They, uh, I mean, the event was supposed to happen in January.

633
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:27,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it would have the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Splatoon 3 competitions along with, you know, the usual Nintendo stuff.

634
00:44:27,096 --> 00:44:31,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, they, uh, they put it off, um, because of these threats.

635
00:44:31,758 --> 00:44:43,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, now they, uh, they have a suspect in hand, but they don't know if their motives, like what their motives actually are.

636
00:44:44,564 --> 00:45:00,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I really do hope that, I mean, I'm glad that they caught somebody, but I really do hope it is the right person just because the Japanese justice system is very, um, against the, the suspected.

637
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:01,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it that way.

638
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:04,076
[SPEAKER_09]: You love to see accountability, but only when it's right.

639
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.

640
00:45:06,262 --> 00:45:13,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really do hope that this is the person who is making the threats and that they did indeed catch them.

641
00:45:13,366 --> 00:45:18,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to see, you know, a safe and fun event happen.

642
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:25,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, that's the primary thing is, I mean, honestly enough, I just want people to stop being shits.

643
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:26,593
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but that doesn't happen.

644
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:27,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

645
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:27,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

646
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Shitty people gonna shit.

647
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:32,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm glad, you know,

648
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:34,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they were proactive about it too.

649
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,180
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.

650
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,143
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good to see this sort of accountability because it's a deterrent, you know, again, we hope it's right.

651
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:50,408
[SPEAKER_09]: But assuming it is, you know, we'd love to see this type of accountability because it deters people from being shits in the future if they like, Oh, shit, I probably, you know, shouldn't do that.

652
00:45:50,408 --> 00:45:59,974
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's been part of the frustrating thing with, you know, everything that's happened with the swatting phenomenon is that you completely see, you know, these horrible things that are happening to people.

653
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:03,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a very big lack of accountability in the people that pull the pranks.

654
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:18,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we see some police departments and so forth are starting to do more about that, but how frustrating because it really feels like they've been behind the curve on what shitheads on the internet are doing that this continues to happen.

655
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway.

656
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:31,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and that's why I think that I'm going to take just a slight aside here is that the moment that you're getting any sort of harassment online from any particular person or group, you make note of it.

657
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:38,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's one thing if it's just like, oh, you know, someone just being shitty and then you never see them again.

658
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would definitely if you're seeing repeat offenders,

659
00:46:43,908 --> 00:46:51,734
[SPEAKER_02]: or if people, I mean, you'll be able to tell if someone is just on you, right?

660
00:46:51,734 --> 00:47:04,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep a record of every interaction with this person, everything that someone says, hey, so-and-so was talking about you and or any time that you see them in a lobby that you're in.

661
00:47:04,944 --> 00:47:09,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have even if you just have that gut feeling, save your screenshots, save your receipts.

662
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:11,289
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know when it's going to help you.

663
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:11,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

664
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:15,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's not just 999 episodes.

665
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 999 tangents that we go on in a typical episode.

666
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:19,604
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, it is.

667
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:20,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It is good advice.

668
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:23,708
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, document, document that shit.

669
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:24,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

670
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I document everything because you never know.

671
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:31,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

672
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:32,027
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

673
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:34,249
[SPEAKER_09]: You should see the file I have on you, Rob.

674
00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:37,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of scared because I'm I'm a forgetful person.

675
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:38,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure my file is full.

676
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:41,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Like remember that time, like seven years ago, you said that thing.

677
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:43,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be like, no, I don't.

678
00:47:43,796 --> 00:47:49,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I Rob, I just have one little phrase for you.

679
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Who needs a dining room?

680
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:51,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Efsler.

681
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:53,324
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

682
00:47:53,324 --> 00:47:53,644
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

683
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:54,364
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

684
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of recent conversation.

685
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:59,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll get to that later in the show.

686
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:00,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for sure.

687
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:01,628
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

688
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:06,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's move on and talk about this next story, Loki.

689
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:09,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is something your kids play, right?

690
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:10,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

691
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:11,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

692
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:12,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, actually.

693
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:14,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to think about it.

694
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:15,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Had to think about it.

695
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:19,738
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, very significantly, they play it.

696
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:21,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, apparently, you know, there's

697
00:48:22,714 --> 00:48:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's been a while now that people have been calling Roblox kind of exploitative for children, you know, that they're exploiting child labor or whatever.

698
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:44,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, now we have the Roblox studio head, Stefano Corazza, trying very poorly to say, hey, you know what?

699
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:48,170
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at it like that, but it's not quite like that.

700
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:54,525
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'll let you judge for yourself based off his comments here.

701
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:58,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I don't know, you could say this for a lot of things, right?

702
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:02,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you could say, okay, we're exploiting, you know, child labor, right?

703
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:09,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could say we're offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job and even like an income.

704
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:14,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can be like a 15 year, this is actually verbatim, I'm not even trying to paraphrase this.

705
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:25,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can be like 15 years old in Indonesia living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something and make money and then sustain my life.

706
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,241
[SPEAKER_07]: One, you know, that's still child labor.

707
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:38,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, just because you're saying, well, it's okay here because, you know, the children need money to survive because they're impoverished.

708
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:41,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I mispronounced that twice.

709
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:41,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor.

710
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:45,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's still child labor.

711
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,574
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still exploiting child labor.

712
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:49,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm sorry, this is what it is.

713
00:49:49,715 --> 00:49:50,336
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fast.

714
00:49:50,336 --> 00:49:50,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

715
00:49:50,696 --> 00:50:12,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you still got more to read, but it's fascinating to me that somewhere at Roblox headquarters, somewhere in a skyscraper where Roblox is headquartered somewhere in the world, there was an executive level meeting this week to discuss, OK, we need to brainstorm reasons to justify children working to tell the press.

716
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:16,754
[SPEAKER_09]: How did we get from accusation to this response?

717
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:19,096
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a well-crafted response here.

718
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:43,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but then they just keep going.

719
00:50:43,051 --> 00:50:47,817
[SPEAKER_07]: They just keep shoving that foot further up into their throat.

720
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:52,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they go to explain that, you know... Why do I feel my foot in my butt?

721
00:50:53,671 --> 00:51:00,834
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course there are people that are teenagers and we've hired some teenagers that have had millions of players on the platform.

722
00:51:00,834 --> 00:51:05,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also said that they feel like, oh my God, this is the biggest gift.

723
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:07,316
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden I could create something.

724
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:08,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I had millions of users.

725
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:10,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I made so much money I could retire.

726
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:15,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't think that's going to be the majority of the platform people making that kind of money.

727
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:22,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And not to mention that people can't make that kind of money because you take a cut every single possible place on that platform.

728
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:23,641
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

729
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:26,043
[SPEAKER_09]: The teenagers made money.

730
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:31,206
[SPEAKER_09]: How much of that money did you take out of a teenager's pocket?

731
00:51:31,206 --> 00:51:33,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, big meeting to discuss.

732
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:36,430
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we justify?

733
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: They pay less than 30% of what you make in the game to the actual player, because you have to cash out.

734
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:47,257
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have 100,000 roblox, which I think is like

735
00:51:48,544 --> 00:51:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of I want to say 100,000 800 is I believe $20.

736
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:51,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot.

737
00:51:51,727 --> 00:51:52,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So Oh, $1,000 is okay.

738
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:54,270
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're gonna have $1,000.

739
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Then roblox is cut, you end up with $350.

740
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:10,607
[SPEAKER_07]: out of

741
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:30,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the outcry there?

742
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:35,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there is outcry, but, you know, they're justifying it with, well, hey, you know what?

743
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:36,255
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they gonna do?

744
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:40,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they gonna... They're making games that they'll be able to earn some money to live, you know?

745
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:43,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, they're gonna be in one of those sweatshops out there making some Levi's, you know?

746
00:52:43,862 --> 00:52:45,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, well, whatever, you know?

747
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:47,104
[SPEAKER_07]: One way or the other, right?

748
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:48,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all... It's fine.

749
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:49,466
[SPEAKER_07]: No one cares, right?

750
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:49,907
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.

751
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:52,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't.

752
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:56,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby in chat says this response is in response to a GDC talk.

753
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:59,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, somebody was dragging Roblox at GDC.

754
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:00,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it needed to happen.

755
00:53:00,922 --> 00:53:02,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, probably should have.

756
00:53:02,183 --> 00:53:02,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

757
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:11,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when, you know, Roblox is trying to position themselves as this platform to make, you know, as Fortnite does a very similar thing, to be fair.

758
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:20,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's very the platforms are very different, but Fortnite wants you to make, you know, experiences and things that exist within the Fortnite world as well.

759
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:27,299
[SPEAKER_07]: They did have a PR rep step in later on, so that the vast majority of people that are earning money on Roblox are over 18, just

760
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:32,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Not all of them are children.

761
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:35,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Bobby also says that's just an explanation why they had this detailed response.

762
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:36,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

763
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:49,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have between the time GDC happened a couple of weeks ago and now to have that meeting to again, how are we going to justify what we do to taking money from children?

764
00:53:49,086 --> 00:53:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

765
00:53:50,787 --> 00:53:54,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So great.

766
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:54,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

767
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's move on.

768
00:53:58,731 --> 00:54:07,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about a growing trend, I guess you could say, in the industry, which is funny horror games.

769
00:54:07,054 --> 00:54:10,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I do play scary games occasionally.

770
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:16,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know a lot about these types of games, admittedly, but I've watched people stream them, and I can never figure out what's going on.

771
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:19,380
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, maybe you've watched people play Lethal Company?

772
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:24,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which I have it's not like my company.

773
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

774
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it funny, Loki?

775
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it funny?

776
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:29,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, can be.

777
00:54:29,902 --> 00:54:32,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the monsters are kind of silly sometimes.

778
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:43,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because apparently these games are doing well because they use comedy as a way to, you know, make the scares, you know, make it, I guess, maybe feel a little bit more safe.

779
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:45,897
[SPEAKER_09]: We could look at games such as Lollipop Chainsaw.

780
00:54:45,897 --> 00:54:49,660
[SPEAKER_09]: We could look at movies such as Shaun of the Dead, American Psycho, Scream.

781
00:54:50,441 --> 00:54:51,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit different.

782
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:57,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say like, so Lethal Company, it's funny because of the personalities that play it.

783
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,224
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very kind of cheap looking game.

784
00:55:00,224 --> 00:55:07,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, you know, when you're playing it, like you're probably going to die.

785
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very likely that you're going to die.

786
00:55:09,648 --> 00:55:10,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a part of the game.

787
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's in the title, obviously.

788
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:18,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing the role play Call of Cthulhu, where your end goal is just to die the most glorious death you possibly can.

789
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:33,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, another game that's very similar, Content Warning, to kind of put a pin in this, Content Warning did very well during its first 24 hours of launch, and that's because they were giving it away for free.

790
00:55:33,499 --> 00:55:35,580
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a free-to-play launch day on April 1st.

791
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I love landfall games.

792
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,221
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great.

793
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,962
[SPEAKER_09]: 6 million Steam downloads, 200,000 concurrent players

794
00:55:55,726 --> 00:56:05,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, you can buy it now if you want for $8, whatever that translates to in your region, but about $8 is what that counts as.

795
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:08,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're talking about though, they're going to fix some bugs.

796
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:10,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was some voice chat issues and so forth.

797
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,951
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently, it's doing very well because it is similar to Lethal Company.

798
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:15,812
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

799
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Landfall Games are great.

800
00:56:32,624 --> 00:56:35,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I've loved this company for a while now.

801
00:56:35,947 --> 00:56:37,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever since ClusterTruck.

802
00:56:37,748 --> 00:56:46,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had ClusterTruck, they did Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, they had the Totally Accurate Battle Royale, which is pretty funny.

803
00:56:46,254 --> 00:56:55,040
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another free-running, along the lines of ClusterTruck as well.

804
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,941
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just a great indie company.

805
00:56:56,941 --> 00:56:57,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth checking out.

806
00:56:58,462 --> 00:56:59,163
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

807
00:56:59,163 --> 00:57:01,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you pick up this new game?

808
00:57:01,344 --> 00:57:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't yet.

809
00:57:02,425 --> 00:57:07,048
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know me, I stack my- You'll add it to your backlog.

810
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,249
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much there.

811
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:16,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I, the other day I was going through my Humble Bundle stuff and like I have so many hundreds of games I haven't redeemed yet.

812
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:18,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just it's ridiculous.

813
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:19,577
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

814
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:20,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to our next story.

815
00:57:20,658 --> 00:57:24,481
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

816
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:25,722
[SPEAKER_08]: You're muted on Discord just so you know.

817
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:52,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even recall having even hit the button so at any rate it's a it's a little sad but probably a time as the executive producer of the Dragon Quest series Miyake Yu has decided to step down and we've already got some thoughts about who's gonna take over but

818
00:57:53,764 --> 00:58:01,627
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, he's going to go to Squenix's smartphone games as head of that.

819
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:12,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, we're going to see who's going to be next, but one of the people that they're thinking of is going to be Saito Yosuke, who did the NieR series.

820
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?

821
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:23,677
[SPEAKER_02]: He also was a producer on Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age and Dragon Quest X Online.

822
00:58:23,677 --> 00:58:26,299
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?

823
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:27,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting to see what comes.

824
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:36,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope this isn't tacky, but I can't help but think of the recent passing of Toriyama and wondering if some of that plays into this.

825
00:58:38,563 --> 00:59:07,060
[SPEAKER_09]: um I mean we don't know but it's it's just like it's it's kind of hard for me not to go like well with Toriyama just recently having passed away and you know so much that went into you know the character design and so forth this seems just very oddly timed I don't know if this is something where it's like we want to pass the baton at this point or maybe you know it could just be an it could be the right opportunity came up I understand sometimes the right opportunity for a new job I don't think it's related at all yeah I just couldn't help but I was like this does seem

826
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,421
[SPEAKER_09]: very soon after all of that.

827
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

828
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: These these sort of corporate decisions, though, they usually go through like a lot of decision making process.

829
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

830
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I I would think that that the two were would have to be unrelated.

831
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm willing to be wrong.

832
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

833
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: On this anyway.

834
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:34,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't I don't think that it's that it's related.

835
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:38,667
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be very curious to see what happens with Dragon Quest.

836
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:41,409
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we on now 12 at this point, it's just Dragon Quest 11.

837
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:45,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like it's been years since we've had a new Dragon Quest game, honestly.

838
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:48,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know they kind of like re released 10 in Japan.

839
00:59:48,514 --> 00:59:52,457
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, that does shit for fuck for us here in the US.

840
00:59:52,457 --> 00:59:55,199
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have Dragon Quest 10 or an offline version or any of that.

841
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought for sure the offline Dragon Quest 10 was the way they were going to finally bring it out over here.

842
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Miyake has been working since Dragon Quest V in the capacity, so, you know, I would imagine that maybe he might even be looking forward to doing something different.

843
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:20,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Quest Buster is pointing out Yuji Naka also threw some shade at Yu Miyake, saying that he had submitted lies at his trial.

844
01:00:20,633 --> 01:00:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

845
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:23,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Drama.

846
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:24,195
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

847
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll save that drama for your llama.

848
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:33,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, well, speaking of drama, there's a lot of it in this next story from kind of a surprising place, I have to admit, which is what makes this so interesting, Loki.

849
01:00:34,562 --> 01:00:58,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, I mean, we talk about crunch all the time, but one company that probably didn't expect it from is from the developers of the Life is Strange, True Colors, and Before the Storm, Deck Nine Games, who was covered by an IGN report where they talked to current and former employees alleging the studio was a toxic place to work at.

850
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:02,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, there was crunch and poor leadership.

851
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:18,051
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically they said that all the females that they spoke to were subjected to harassment in the company, that the

852
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:39,575
[SPEAKER_07]: there was a kind of, they were folks claiming, you know, or I guess, having in inappropriate relationships with women, calling the Black Lives Matter movement, a hate movement, getting hung up on different political ideologies.

853
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:44,016
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that kind of stuff.

854
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:46,137
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I also trash things.

855
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:57,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then we have crunch, you know, so they were saying that there's, you know, that essentially there is tighter, tight deadlines and small budgets.

856
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:00,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a crunch culture there.

857
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:11,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And saying that they were deck nine, of course, is defending their self saying they were committed to champion diversity and telling stories from historically underrepresented groups.

858
01:02:11,972 --> 01:02:13,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they all say that.

859
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:15,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

860
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:44,501
[SPEAKER_09]: This studio making this game that is kind of a very well-known sort of like queer representation kind of franchise that gets a lot of awards, those types of visibility sorts of awards and representation, just to hear that

861
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:56,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just goes to show, you know, kind of going all the way back to when, you know, in the earlier days of COVID lockdowns, when this was first being brought to light, that this was going on at places like Activision, Blizzard, and so forth.

862
01:02:56,626 --> 01:03:03,909
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think a lot of us kind of slowly became more and more aware that these are issues that are deeply rooted in the industry.

863
01:03:04,369 --> 01:03:07,571
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just exacerbated by what's going on at Activision Blizzard and so forth.

864
01:03:07,571 --> 01:03:09,612
[SPEAKER_09]: But these are these are industry problems.

865
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:14,835
[SPEAKER_09]: These are problems that, you know, lie in the deepest, darkest corners of a lot of these places.

866
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:22,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And now to see that it's happening, even at a studio that's making a game that stands for things that are quite the opposite of that.

867
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know everything is alleged and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

868
01:03:25,262 --> 01:03:26,563
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's be real.

869
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:30,105
[SPEAKER_09]: When multiple people have been interviewed and multiple people's accounts are collaborating,

870
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,470
[SPEAKER_09]: ZachGurus

871
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,332
[SPEAKER_07]: who was apparently the point of conflict.

872
01:03:52,332 --> 01:04:05,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were saying that aside from all the stuff about BLM and all that, that there even ended up being, I guess, Nazi imagery hidden within the Life is Strange title as well.

873
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:08,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, gross, gross, gross, gross.

874
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:09,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, also,

875
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

876
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:19,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course he defended himself saying that he didn't recall making those comments.

877
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:20,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course not.

878
01:04:20,926 --> 01:04:24,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't recall is like one of the worst defenses.

879
01:04:24,368 --> 01:04:27,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

880
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:28,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

881
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:32,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Game industry being game industry.

882
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:54,518
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

883
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:10,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

884
01:05:10,437 --> 01:05:21,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, these are problems that are very deep rooted in the industry that unfortunately are coming to light through stories like this, which is very, very disappointing.

885
01:05:21,248 --> 01:05:27,154
[SPEAKER_09]: But I agree with what, you know, is being said in chat, as Joan Hunter-Matt says, and you wonder why more studios are unionizing.

886
01:05:27,774 --> 01:05:33,196
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're all for protecting their employees moving forward, then support them when they decide to unionize.

887
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

888
01:05:34,776 --> 01:05:35,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

889
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:42,318
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's it's very disappointing to hear about this happening anywhere in the industry.

890
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:48,460
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, knowing that this studio has taken home awards, but I I have to remind myself

891
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:59,638
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, it's, it's, there's a lot of people that work there that have nothing to do with any of this and do believe in a lot of that stuff that the game is representing.

892
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:14,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to remind myself that probably there's plenty more people and it's just unfortunately a few people with power that are now tarnishing this studio's name and this story this week, which I think is very important.

893
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:15,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And Questbuster does want to point out

894
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,080
[SPEAKER_09]: that we do have different studios here.

895
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Dotnod Studios did Life is Strange 1 and 2, but it was passed on to new ownership.

896
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:27,528
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is, you know, True Colors that we're talking about specifically after they were done.

897
01:06:27,528 --> 01:06:35,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Still, I do believe if I'm not mistaken, True Colors still itself won many of these types of awards from what I recall.

898
01:06:35,675 --> 01:06:38,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, and yeah.

899
01:06:38,837 --> 01:06:41,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, obviously we want to make sure it's the right studio.

900
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:45,963
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, my other point is, I would bet the vast majority of people at the studio were not the problem.

901
01:06:45,963 --> 01:06:48,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's something important to keep in the back of our minds.

902
01:06:48,485 --> 01:06:56,051
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a certain person or people in power that did this shit.

903
01:06:56,051 --> 01:07:00,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Off with their heads, metaphorically.

904
01:07:00,274 --> 01:07:01,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to get banned from Twitch.

905
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:02,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to get banned from Twitch.

906
01:07:02,976 --> 01:07:04,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, I'm sure metaphorically, of course.

907
01:07:04,998 --> 01:07:05,978
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I always mean.

908
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:07,419
[SPEAKER_09]: What I always mean.

909
01:07:07,419 --> 01:07:07,700
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

910
01:07:10,478 --> 01:07:21,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, let's talk about, oh boy, let's talk about a studio that's just, this game is just becoming the biggest joke of the year, I'm sorry to say, but it's of course Suicide Squad.

911
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:24,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably didn't even have to tell you what the game was before you already knew what I'm talking about.

912
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:34,424
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, if we talk about Suicide Squad for a moment, this of course being that live service game that now has a hacker problem.

913
01:07:34,424 --> 01:07:39,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Hackers have figured out how to gain access to unreleased characters and skins.

914
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:42,433
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what that means.

915
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,135
[SPEAKER_09]: They're already in the game.

916
01:07:45,135 --> 01:07:47,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just want to pay you to be able to access those things.

917
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:48,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

918
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

919
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:50,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

920
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:59,467
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the type of lesson that executives, I don't want to say studios, because again, most of the people that worked on this game, probably very hardworking, good people.

921
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:02,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Executives that make these type of shitty calls, good.

922
01:08:03,117 --> 01:08:04,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, I'm glad it happened.

923
01:08:04,938 --> 01:08:15,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been watching the reviews for all of the Season 1 content pack that they have, and it's all recycled stuff from the game.

924
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:25,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the fight against Brainiac is another re-skinned boss battle, just like they did in the finale of the game, which is lazy as it is already.

925
01:08:27,948 --> 01:08:38,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like such a grind fest to do anything in the game because they're trying to get you to pay to unlock a character in this $70 game already.

926
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:39,519
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just bad.

927
01:08:39,519 --> 01:08:40,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this game is just like...

928
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:44,116
[SPEAKER_07]: is is the best example.

929
01:08:44,116 --> 01:08:50,582
[SPEAKER_09]: If you actually bought this game, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna shame because you know, you probably had high expectations.

930
01:08:50,582 --> 01:08:51,883
[SPEAKER_09]: But abandon ship.

931
01:08:51,883 --> 01:08:53,264
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to abandon ship.

932
01:08:53,264 --> 01:09:02,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to get out you want to see a fun time go go look at the Suicide Squad game subreddit where people are just like, Listen, I'm sick of this.

933
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:03,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

934
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I tried to hold out hope for this stuff, but like, clear that they're not going to do anything that like they are just

935
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:19,515
[SPEAKER_07]: regurgitating garbage just to try to get... Which reddit is this on?

936
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:22,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the SuicideSquadGame subreddit.

937
01:09:23,544 --> 01:09:26,587
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a moment because DarkSakura is AFK and she's going to do the next segment.

938
01:09:26,587 --> 01:09:27,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not?

939
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:29,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see what this is all about.

940
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:30,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

941
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's I think it's a suicide.

942
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Suicide Squad game, if I remember correctly.

943
01:09:35,496 --> 01:09:37,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Suicide Squad gaming, I think might be.

944
01:09:37,818 --> 01:09:40,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I just I just game.

945
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:40,901
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I did.

946
01:09:40,901 --> 01:09:44,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a search and I think I found it here.

947
01:09:44,004 --> 01:09:46,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we actually look at Suicide Squad gaming,

948
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:51,591
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, am I the only one who genuinely enjoys everything in this game?

949
01:09:51,591 --> 01:09:56,995
[SPEAKER_09]: After all this grind, I finally got him.

950
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:57,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

951
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:59,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see a lot of people dogging on this.

952
01:09:59,837 --> 01:10:01,379
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably not that one.

953
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:03,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the right subreddit.

954
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,282
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, I'll try Suicide Squad Game.

955
01:10:05,282 --> 01:10:07,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

956
01:10:07,964 --> 01:10:09,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Suicide Squad The Game?

957
01:10:10,325 --> 01:10:11,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, yeah.

958
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:14,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, that's locked private now, so we can't get into that one.

959
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I don't know.

960
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:19,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Play a Suicide Squad game?

961
01:10:19,496 --> 01:10:20,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, whatever.

962
01:10:20,878 --> 01:10:23,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember, but yeah, there's quite a few.

963
01:10:23,962 --> 01:10:25,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I suddenly stopped here.

964
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this segment would go somewhere more fun.

965
01:10:27,065 --> 01:10:28,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize to all the listeners.

966
01:10:31,372 --> 01:11:00,282
[SPEAKER_09]: uh i swear there was another one though because i i was looking at it um anyway well let me tell you though the the hackers did uh discover how to play as deathstroke who is one of the characters that's teased for an upcoming season uh and now that hacker is the top player on the game's leaderboard so if you log in and check the rankings there you go you can see it right in front of everybody uh also apparently accessible skins for the joker king shark have been accessed uh and of course that stuff is circulating around reddit and

967
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:06,406
[SPEAKER_09]: and wish.com's Lex Luthor's website throughout this last week.

968
01:11:06,406 --> 01:11:08,287
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there you go.

969
01:11:10,006 --> 01:11:14,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this particular news article links to a post.

970
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:17,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is the same Reddit subreddit I was looking at.

971
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:20,073
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, losing interest quickly.

972
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:21,755
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only two comments on this.

973
01:11:21,755 --> 01:11:22,315
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

974
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:36,905
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, no, the one I was looking at was it was like there was a lot of posts on there like they were just like, you know, there was a couple people defending but they're like, I you know, I can't do this anymore type of thing.

975
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

976
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:38,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find it.

977
01:11:39,839 --> 01:11:45,323
[SPEAKER_07]: stupid browser doesn't remember which it's, it's not a big deal.

978
01:11:45,323 --> 01:11:47,805
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need to be yet another.

979
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:51,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't really consider ourselves press or more commentary and that sort of thing.

980
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:57,813
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't need to be yet another press thing that's writing articles based on Reddit.

981
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,775
[SPEAKER_09]: There's enough competition in that space right now, which is every other website.

982
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:00,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So

983
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:07,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um, but what we can do is get to a new segment that is completely our own.

984
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:11,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not a new segment, but our next segment that we've been doing for a very long time that is completely our own.

985
01:12:11,931 --> 01:12:13,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's roll the bumper.

986
01:12:24,355 --> 01:12:32,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

987
01:12:32,123 --> 01:12:34,987
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

988
01:12:34,987 --> 01:12:39,091
[SPEAKER_09]: But once a month, DarkSakura in the year 2024 now focuses on a

989
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:42,934
[SPEAKER_09]: cancelled game.

990
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:48,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a classic game that you never got to play because it was cancelled.

991
01:12:48,437 --> 01:12:51,139
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, this one really fucking hurts.

992
01:12:51,139 --> 01:12:53,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I kind of hate you.

993
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,261
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also love you for acknowledging it.

994
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:55,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to it.

995
01:12:55,881 --> 01:12:57,642
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the- Another one that cancelled it.

996
01:12:57,642 --> 01:12:58,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're not.

997
01:12:58,883 --> 01:12:59,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to it.

998
01:12:59,623 --> 01:13:01,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's roll what footage we have.

999
01:13:01,384 --> 01:13:04,706
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the classic cancelled game of the week?

1000
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:08,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man Universe.

1001
01:13:08,348 --> 01:13:14,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer set in the Mega Man series.

1002
01:13:14,452 --> 01:13:19,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It was being developed by Capcom for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

1003
01:13:19,175 --> 01:13:32,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mostly based off of Mega Man 2, but you could make your own levels, customize your characters, and it would have also been the first game in the whole series to be called Mega Man in Japan instead of Rockman.

1004
01:13:36,126 --> 01:13:52,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It had like rendered levels and CG characters but played in that same sort of side-scrolling, you know, version of it.

1005
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:55,697
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make your own levels.

1006
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:59,639
[SPEAKER_02]: You place your platformer, obstacles, enemies, stuff.

1007
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:02,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You could share your levels online.

1008
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Mario Maker.

1009
01:14:04,842 --> 01:14:15,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You could customize your Mega Man with different exchangeable parts and chips that give him different attributes, like jumping height, weapons he could use.

1010
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:23,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the game had different versions of Mega Man, including the North American Nest Box.

1011
01:14:25,343 --> 01:14:34,977
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the other Capcom property characters like Gideon from Street Fighter, Arthur from Ghosts'n Goblins and they had some DLC on the line.

1012
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:38,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game started production in March 2010

1013
01:14:40,144 --> 01:14:46,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a trademark registered by Capcom on April 27th, 2010.

1014
01:14:46,588 --> 01:14:49,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Another reason why I chose this for April.

1015
01:14:49,549 --> 01:14:56,013
[SPEAKER_02]: On July 16th, a stop-motion teaser was created by IM8Bit here in the U.S.

1016
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:59,555
[SPEAKER_02]: that had MegaMan, Ryu, and Arthur.

1017
01:14:59,555 --> 01:15:03,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And Inafune, we all know Inafune Keiji.

1018
01:15:04,657 --> 01:15:05,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read the quote.

1019
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:14,681
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to preserve as much as we can of the classic 8-bit Mega Man feel while allowing players to project their own Mega Man into the game.

1020
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:24,765
[SPEAKER_02]: There were gameplay trailers out as of September 2, 2010, and then afterwards they revealed the level editor and customization.

1021
01:15:24,765 --> 01:15:31,387
[SPEAKER_02]: There were other trailers for the game and had music by a cover band called The Megas.

1022
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:37,790
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of different folks working on this.

1023
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:45,034
[SPEAKER_02]: It was produced by Ito Akiko, who wanted feedback on what the fans wanted to see in the game.

1024
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:49,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, after four months though, when Hune left,

1025
01:15:54,238 --> 01:16:08,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Christian Svensson said that despite their silence on the game's development, it wasn't cancelled, but had some setbacks because of criticism and unresponsive controls.

1026
01:16:08,421 --> 01:16:19,123
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the final word though on March 31st, 2011, that Capcom officially cancelled the game due to, quote, various circumstances.

1027
01:16:20,144 --> 01:16:21,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's it.

1028
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some trailers and we had some ideas and that's about it.

1029
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:31,453
[SPEAKER_09]: which was sad.

1030
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:38,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna I'm gonna admit the one I mean, the original trailer was like super badass that we had for the game, right?

1031
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:41,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it like, like showed everything in motion was really cool.

1032
01:16:41,357 --> 01:16:42,657
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the concept.

1033
01:16:42,657 --> 01:16:43,357
[SPEAKER_09]: That was great.

1034
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:49,360
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, you know, when that kind of second teaser came out, and I'm gonna for those that are watching on Twitch Live, I'll play it again.

1035
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So you kind of see this footage here.

1036
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,661
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm looking at this footage,

1037
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:57,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of get Mega Man PC vibes.

1038
01:16:57,023 --> 01:17:04,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is, but it doesn't seem to like snap the way a lot of Mega Man games do it.

1039
01:17:04,907 --> 01:17:11,770
[SPEAKER_09]: This this feels like somebody doing a PC like custom Mega Man game is what it looks like.

1040
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess it would be another to kind of get in there and play it.

1041
01:17:14,231 --> 01:17:16,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So but the concept was so good.

1042
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:20,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like the execution may not have been what we were going to think it was, which

1043
01:17:21,215 --> 01:17:21,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is great!

1044
01:17:21,956 --> 01:17:28,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have Mega Man Maker, which is independently made, but is basically this, but better, and plays like Mega Man.

1045
01:17:28,802 --> 01:17:35,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, if we want a computer, like a PC Mega Man that sorta looks like this, but plays like Mega Man, then you have, you know, Mega Man with a...

1046
01:17:38,437 --> 01:17:52,460
[SPEAKER_09]: S219 Matt says, I actually played this at Digital Life many, many years ago.

1047
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It really did play what, like what Mario Maker would be.

1048
01:17:55,660 --> 01:18:00,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't like our traditional Mega Man game, kind of felt like a mobile-ish port.

1049
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:03,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, now, now we're getting into that.

1050
01:18:03,802 --> 01:18:05,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that's,

1051
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:31,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this was also supposed to be like a didn't they did have like what was it a was it a PSP or Vita type of game that was there was a Mega Man maker type game that was on there I thought or maybe it was something like this too I don't remember but there was something that was Mega Man powered up Mega Man that's what it was so there was that which I think

1052
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:33,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that, I do remember that.

1053
01:18:48,868 --> 01:19:01,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will point out my other choice was Maverick Hunter, which was a first-person shooter game in the franchise that was to be developed by Armature Studio.

1054
01:19:01,215 --> 01:19:03,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It was extreme!

1055
01:19:03,216 --> 01:19:09,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was actually an attempt by Ina Hune.

1056
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:16,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he was responsible for trying to re-establish the Western versions of the game.

1057
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:36,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, the character design I thought was cool was by Adi Granov, who did a lot of cards for Magic the Gathering and some Dragonlance and some of the earlier, I'd say like 80s era D&D artwork.

1058
01:19:36,673 --> 01:19:46,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And his wife was Julie Bell, who also is an artist in her own right and was his, a lot of times, his physical model for a lot of female people he drew.

1059
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:53,639
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw Bomberman X-Series and he's like, I want more of that.

1060
01:19:53,639 --> 01:20:00,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I went for something that I think would have been a little bit more universal.

1061
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:01,641
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's it.

1062
01:20:01,641 --> 01:20:08,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Powered up Megaman looks awesome.

1063
01:20:08,882 --> 01:20:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that was it for the Classic Game.

1064
01:20:12,389 --> 01:20:12,849
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1065
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:15,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I've been talking to the mic on mute while I had this rolling.

1066
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:16,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1067
01:20:16,132 --> 01:20:21,076
[SPEAKER_09]: But for those watching on Twitch, I actually have the footage, as you mentioned, from Mega Man Powered Up playing.

1068
01:20:21,076 --> 01:20:27,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And it actually kind of does look like what you would expect Mega Man on a mobile platform to look like a little bit, you know, on a PlayStation.

1069
01:20:27,341 --> 01:20:29,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is cute.

1070
01:20:29,182 --> 01:20:32,085
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I think a re-release on this would be cute.

1071
01:20:32,085 --> 01:20:33,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it was on a mobile platform.

1072
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:36,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Mega Man Powered Up Mega Man was on.

1073
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:38,970
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1074
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:44,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let us move on and talk about some other headlines happening in the industry real quick.

1075
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:47,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So Loki, we'll go to you for some rapid fire news.

1076
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,311
[SPEAKER_07]: It was only PSP.

1077
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:49,332
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.

1078
01:20:49,332 --> 01:21:01,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so there is a, a, I guess, poll done by BAFTA Games, talking about the most iconic video game characters of all time.

1079
01:21:01,003 --> 01:21:02,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And who won?

1080
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Lorecroft.

1081
01:21:04,543 --> 01:21:05,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario, Agent 47, Sonic the Hedgehog

1082
01:21:20,623 --> 01:21:23,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like there's a few campaigns that were going on here.

1083
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:26,664
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I don't want to say like, oh, Lara Croft didn't deserve it.

1084
01:21:26,664 --> 01:21:28,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand she's iconic.

1085
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:29,065
[SPEAKER_09]: No, she's iconic.

1086
01:21:29,065 --> 01:21:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is a little surprising over Mario or Link or, you know, some of the other Sonic, some of the other, you know, iconic characters we've had in gaming over the years.

1087
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:45,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it's a bit surprising, but when I'm British, I can see that too.

1088
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:46,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1089
01:21:46,188 --> 01:21:48,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's interesting.

1090
01:21:50,085 --> 01:22:08,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the fan game formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, now stripped of the Bloodborne coat of paint on it, is now coming out as Nightmare Kart, releasing free on Steam and itch.io on May 31st.

1091
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:17,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to have 20 racers, 16 maps, legally distinct, full campaign mode with boss fights, and versus battle mode.

1092
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:20,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I love that.

1093
01:22:20,723 --> 01:22:21,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Legally distinct.

1094
01:22:21,825 --> 01:22:23,408
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1095
01:22:23,408 --> 01:22:24,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Nightmare cart for free.

1096
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:26,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that price.

1097
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,276
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great price.

1098
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, DarkSakura.

1099
01:22:30,353 --> 01:22:32,714
[SPEAKER_09]: You and I both have some pinball headlines.

1100
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, we do.

1101
01:22:34,135 --> 01:22:45,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are new titles coming out for Pinball FX, some universal pinball TV classics coming out on May 16th this year.

1102
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:55,206
[SPEAKER_02]: There is going to be Xena, Warrior Princess, who is going to be fighting Callisto, Ares, and Caesar with

1103
01:22:55,806 --> 01:22:57,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Nightrider Pinballs.

1104
01:22:57,267 --> 01:22:59,588
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use Kits technology and go against Karr.

1105
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:22,977
[SPEAKER_02]: and have Turbo Boost and Super Pursuit Mode and all those things were in Knight Rider.

1106
01:23:22,977 --> 01:23:25,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so obsessed with Knight Rider in third grade.

1107
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:26,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm gonna leave that there.

1108
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Battlestar Galactica Pinball!

1109
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:33,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to stop the Cylons.

1110
01:23:33,265 --> 01:23:33,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1111
01:23:35,555 --> 01:23:37,217
[SPEAKER_02]: and Remember Old OLR Jokes

1112
01:23:55,466 --> 01:23:55,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1113
01:24:10,185 --> 01:24:12,086
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura said hey Rob

1114
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:34,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, actually, she sent text and went, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1115
01:24:34,197 --> 01:24:35,278
[SPEAKER_09]: No, she actually didn't do that.

1116
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But she said, Hey, Rob, ABBA pinball.

1117
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:41,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, Oh, no, I said, Is it virtual?

1118
01:24:41,105 --> 01:24:42,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is it real?

1119
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,668
[SPEAKER_09]: She put real.

1120
01:24:43,668 --> 01:24:45,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And my response?

1121
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:45,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.

1122
01:24:47,472 --> 01:24:48,033
[SPEAKER_09]: and Abba Pinball!

1123
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:08,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinball Brothers is the pinball manufacturer making this.

1124
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:09,971
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be two variants.

1125
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:17,517
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be the regular version and the Arrival limited edition, Arrival being one of their albums that they were very famous for in the 70s.

1126
01:25:17,517 --> 01:25:22,280
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a Voyage, their newest album, collector edition version.

1127
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:27,744
[SPEAKER_09]: 800 units, 300 collectors editions, 500 limited editions.

1128
01:25:27,744 --> 01:25:32,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess the regular ones will be as many as they need to make, but the other ones will be more limited.

1129
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:40,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Abba songs will be in there as well as a arrival helicopter that is fully interactive happening there.

1130
01:25:40,471 --> 01:25:43,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what they were teasing it with the helicopter.

1131
01:25:43,652 --> 01:25:44,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1132
01:25:44,952 --> 01:25:46,973
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be a 50th anniversary.

1133
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:52,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, this is all in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the date that Abba won the Eurovision Song Contest.

1134
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:53,635
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what it is?

1135
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:57,981
[SPEAKER_09]: One of their kids is a big pinball fan.

1136
01:25:57,981 --> 01:26:03,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's one of Bjorn's kids is a big pinball fan and kind of helped to broker this deal, if you will.

1137
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:06,518
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's the thing, you want to know how much this table costs?

1138
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:15,849
[SPEAKER_09]: $10,000 for the Arrival Limited Edition, $11,000 for the Voyage Collector's Edition.

1139
01:26:15,849 --> 01:26:26,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And many people have been asking me, many people meaning DarkSakura and Bobby have been asking me, am I planning on picking up this table?

1140
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:30,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And the answer is, I literally can't.

1141
01:26:30,612 --> 01:26:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I would literally be divorced if I were to spend this kind of money on a pinball table.

1142
01:26:35,453 --> 01:26:35,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm

1143
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:07,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Black Oven Chat says My Rush Limited Edition was $11,000

1144
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:29,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those prices are really unsurprising, especially for one as deluxe as that looks to be.

1145
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1146
01:27:30,281 --> 01:27:35,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, you know how much our Weird Al would have originally cost us.

1147
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:39,686
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were also getting a P3.

1148
01:27:39,686 --> 01:27:40,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Expensive.

1149
01:27:40,286 --> 01:27:42,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, those tables are the ones you can kind of flip out, right?

1150
01:27:43,839 --> 01:27:51,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Black Knight Sword of Rage, I mean, when we bought just the top or four, that was like, I think, on like a major sales in the late three grand.

1151
01:27:51,905 --> 01:27:52,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1152
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:54,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1153
01:27:54,047 --> 01:27:54,767
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1154
01:27:54,767 --> 01:28:03,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's travel around the world and check out some more budget friendly game releases that are having even $70 looks great in comparison to $10,000.

1155
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:08,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about some more budget friendly releases we have coming out real soon as we travel the world and check out some release dates.

1156
01:28:08,778 --> 01:28:09,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1157
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:18,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not a whole lot this week, but we've got Botany Manor on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1158
01:28:18,664 --> 01:28:21,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Children of the Sun on PC.

1159
01:28:21,325 --> 01:28:30,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Gigantic Rampage Edition on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1160
01:28:30,309 --> 01:28:31,609
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1161
01:28:31,609 --> 01:28:32,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It's April.

1162
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:32,970
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you expect?

1163
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:43,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, definitely the release calendar has slowed down a little bit this time of year, but we will travel to Japan anyway, and I'll tell you the things you can look forward to over there.

1164
01:28:43,516 --> 01:28:51,623
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo Switch, there is a game called Slave Zero X that is coming out in a regular and limited edition from a company called Beep Japan.

1165
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't make this stuff up.

1166
01:28:54,465 --> 01:28:55,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know that series.

1167
01:28:57,586 --> 01:28:58,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Utakata no Uchronia Broccoli

1168
01:29:24,552 --> 01:29:29,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see Hatsumira from the Future Undying also releases in Japan this week.

1169
01:29:29,674 --> 01:29:32,215
[SPEAKER_09]: RPG Maker With.

1170
01:29:32,215 --> 01:29:32,995
[SPEAKER_09]: With what?

1171
01:29:32,995 --> 01:29:36,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but that is it's called RPG Maker With.

1172
01:29:36,436 --> 01:29:38,277
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the name of it.

1173
01:29:38,277 --> 01:29:43,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is apparently a new feature called asset sharing that allows you to create games together.

1174
01:29:43,759 --> 01:29:44,319
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat.

1175
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually going to be really freaking cool for collaborative.

1176
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:51,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of good RPGs out there that were made in RPG Maker.

1177
01:29:52,242 --> 01:29:59,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so the fact that this is available on the Switch and I'm sure I'm sure a PC version of this is not is happening somewhere.

1178
01:29:59,966 --> 01:30:01,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not on my list right now.

1179
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:02,167
[SPEAKER_09]: So pretty cool.

1180
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:03,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1181
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:03,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see.

1182
01:30:03,568 --> 01:30:04,828
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do we have?

1183
01:30:04,828 --> 01:30:08,150
[SPEAKER_09]: The Dragonists, Command of the Flame, also out in Japan this week.

1184
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:12,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And Steins Gate Elite gets a price reduction as it goes into a good value addition.

1185
01:30:12,892 --> 01:30:14,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, all of that on the Nintendo Switch.

1186
01:30:14,793 --> 01:30:16,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So still pretty busy in Japan this week.

1187
01:30:16,774 --> 01:30:17,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even do PlayStation 5 yet.

1188
01:30:18,655 --> 01:30:20,076
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's very similar.

1189
01:30:20,076 --> 01:30:28,383
[SPEAKER_09]: That same Slave Zero X game is out as well as the Dragoness, Command of the Flame, both on the PlayStation 5 this week on the 11th as well.

1190
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:29,284
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Europe, DarkSakura?

1191
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,812
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe, just a handful of things.

1192
01:30:32,812 --> 01:30:37,275
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 9th, for PlayStation, we have Pacific Drive Deluxe Edition.

1193
01:30:37,275 --> 01:30:44,179
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 11th, for PCs, we have a Fallout S-B-E-C-I-A-L Anthology.

1194
01:30:44,179 --> 01:30:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 12th, for PlayStation, we have Mixture.

1195
01:30:47,882 --> 01:30:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And also on the 12th, for PlayStation, we have the Talos Principle 2 Devolver Deluxe.

1196
01:30:55,046 --> 01:30:55,387
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1197
01:30:56,773 --> 01:31:09,257
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few more stories for you and then we'll get to our listener roundtable where we invite your emails at participate at orangeandreda.com as well as your calls if you want to join us in our live chat.

1198
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:12,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Discord, I'm sorry, our Discord is VOG Network.

1199
01:31:12,798 --> 01:31:17,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost said discord.com, but that's how you get the client to find us, but it's vognetwork.com.

1200
01:31:18,801 --> 01:31:23,724
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in the green room, we will be taking calls tonight.

1201
01:31:23,724 --> 01:31:25,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I will warn folks.

1202
01:31:25,686 --> 01:31:27,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I expect we're going to have a lot of calls next.

1203
01:31:27,847 --> 01:31:30,329
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't get a lot of calls usually on this show.

1204
01:31:30,329 --> 01:31:35,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I expect we're going to have a few next week just because of, you know, the fact that it's episode 1000.

1205
01:31:35,653 --> 01:31:38,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot guarantee we will get to all the calls next week.

1206
01:31:38,455 --> 01:31:45,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do not want people to feel personally offended, but there will be a time where we have to end the show because we still all have lives to go to the next day.

1207
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:47,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to kind of put that out there.

1208
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:50,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so nobody is surprised.

1209
01:31:50,203 --> 01:31:56,926
[SPEAKER_09]: One other interesting housekeeping thing I need to say at some point during tonight's show, and then we'll get back into news.

1210
01:31:56,926 --> 01:32:03,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is going to affect very many people at all, but it will affect somebody, and I'll get an email about it if I don't say something about it.

1211
01:32:03,609 --> 01:32:14,354
[SPEAKER_09]: For the last 999 episodes, when this file is put out on the feed, it actually has the episode number embedded into the podcast metadata.

1212
01:32:15,382 --> 01:32:25,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So it actually knows what episode number this is because that's in the, or the, it's the track number, but it's, it's what we put in there as the podcast number in there.

1213
01:32:25,968 --> 01:32:30,431
[SPEAKER_09]: After tonight's episode, I will no longer be able to, well, there's one of two things I can do.

1214
01:32:31,553 --> 01:32:34,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd be curious to hear from the people that actually use this.

1215
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:37,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I can either leave it blank because here's the thing.

1216
01:32:37,276 --> 01:32:39,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It, it, and you probably guessed it.

1217
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:41,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It only holds three digits.

1218
01:32:41,179 --> 01:32:52,506
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't go past 999 and you can't put letters in there because Jason suggested I do 1K1 and I was like, well, that'll only get me to 1009, but, um, so you can't do letters.

1219
01:32:52,506 --> 01:32:54,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So literally there's two options.

1220
01:32:54,447 --> 01:32:57,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, I don't fill it out anymore, which is what I'm leading towards right now.

1221
01:32:57,949 --> 01:33:00,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, we roll the odometer over.

1222
01:33:01,531 --> 01:33:03,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And we start back at zero.

1223
01:33:03,994 --> 01:33:08,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know if it will hold zero, but we start back at zero next week.

1224
01:33:08,299 --> 01:33:10,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one, two, three after that.

1225
01:33:10,161 --> 01:33:16,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So from the people that actually give a shit about the podcast metadata, I would love to hear from you.

1226
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:17,369
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want?

1227
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:19,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Because tonight's it.

1228
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:21,133
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be no more episode numbers after tonight.

1229
01:33:22,094 --> 01:33:23,795
[SPEAKER_09]: unless I implement one of these.

1230
01:33:23,795 --> 01:33:27,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do like 999 and then plus one or something?

1231
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:29,300
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it only holds three characters.

1232
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,160
[SPEAKER_09]: There will not.

1233
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,962
[SPEAKER_09]: The title will be fine.

1234
01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:36,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So like when you see it in your feeds, it will still be episode 1000 feet.

1235
01:33:36,025 --> 01:33:40,248
[SPEAKER_09]: This is only the tags embedded in the file metadata.

1236
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:46,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We become the one that makes it necessary for them to change the entire system.

1237
01:33:46,953 --> 01:33:51,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I will place a phone call to Tim Apple right now requesting that iTunes extend that field.

1238
01:33:53,849 --> 01:34:01,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, now I, I actually thought of SSJ 100 Matt suggestion in chat who says Roman numerals.

1239
01:34:01,394 --> 01:34:03,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually thought of that.

1240
01:34:03,156 --> 01:34:03,736
[SPEAKER_09]: They're letters.

1241
01:34:03,736 --> 01:34:04,196
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1242
01:34:04,196 --> 01:34:04,877
[SPEAKER_09]: They're letters.

1243
01:34:04,877 --> 01:34:05,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't do that.

1244
01:34:05,898 --> 01:34:08,780
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're still only limited to three characters.

1245
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:14,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually even a number like 15 is going to or 18 is going to be XVIII.

1246
01:34:14,444 --> 01:34:17,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's not enough spaces.

1247
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,961
[SPEAKER_09]: again, Tigerclaw letters only you can't do star one.

1248
01:34:21,961 --> 01:34:25,063
[SPEAKER_09]: So as far as I see it, you got two options.

1249
01:34:25,063 --> 01:34:29,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I get rid of it or the odometer rolls over and next week is episode zero if it even takes a zero.

1250
01:34:29,905 --> 01:34:31,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it takes a zero.

1251
01:34:31,345 --> 01:34:32,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but then that's gonna mess it up though, too.

1252
01:34:32,946 --> 01:34:37,088
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know, you know, you get double numbers for like certain items.

1253
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:43,070
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what, we just maybe we just borrow an old tagline from our old friends economy and just say we are starting over.

1254
01:34:45,407 --> 01:34:48,409
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the show that never ends.

1255
01:34:48,409 --> 01:34:52,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It just goes on and on, my friends.

1256
01:34:52,832 --> 01:34:57,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody started it not knowing when it stops.

1257
01:34:57,736 --> 01:35:01,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And we keep doing it just because.

1258
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:05,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Lurch noises.

1259
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:06,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Lurch noises.

1260
01:35:06,902 --> 01:35:08,223
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1261
01:35:08,223 --> 01:35:08,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1262
01:35:09,574 --> 01:35:10,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1263
01:35:10,894 --> 01:35:12,615
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few other headlines for you.

1264
01:35:12,615 --> 01:35:17,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've got a great story tonight on how we're all getting older, just in time for our thousandth episode.

1265
01:35:17,456 --> 01:35:21,677
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, Loki with an interesting headline here.

1266
01:35:21,677 --> 01:35:30,139
[SPEAKER_07]: So coming from the Russian newspaper, Kommersant, apparently,

1267
01:35:31,407 --> 01:35:49,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Vladimir Putin wants to jump into the video game wars himself with his own Russian-built console to compete against the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. And to share the Russian propaganda.

1268
01:35:52,931 --> 01:36:00,556
[SPEAKER_07]: There was orders handed down from the Kremlin to consider the issue of organizing the production of stationary and portable game consoles.

1269
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:07,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Portable game consoles and game consoles.

1270
01:36:07,331 --> 01:36:24,194
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds weirdly worded there, but, um, essentially from, from the per, per the, um, the paper itself said there's, there's no competence to produce their own, uh, PlayStation, Xbox consoles and create such a system from scratch.

1271
01:36:24,194 --> 01:36:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take up to 10 years.

1272
01:36:25,815 --> 01:36:26,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1273
01:36:26,475 --> 01:36:27,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can't just go woof.

1274
01:36:28,504 --> 01:36:31,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we get that man who made Tetris?

1275
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:33,846
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in America now.

1276
01:36:33,846 --> 01:36:36,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

1277
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:38,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So good luck with that.

1278
01:36:38,268 --> 01:36:41,730
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be hopefully dead by then.

1279
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:48,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, this I feel like this device is probably going to be about as good as a Nintendo V. Do you remember the V?

1280
01:36:49,838 --> 01:36:50,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard the V, yeah.

1281
01:37:13,126 --> 01:37:17,227
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, you can look up the Nontendo or whatever this company was called.

1282
01:37:17,227 --> 01:37:20,008
[SPEAKER_09]: The V, which is a complete rip off.

1283
01:37:20,008 --> 01:37:26,910
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like and I get it because, you know, all these companies pulled out of Russia after the Ukraine invasion.

1284
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:27,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1285
01:37:27,111 --> 01:37:30,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this was I think this was in China where they essentially.

1286
01:37:30,492 --> 01:37:31,952
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the V was the V was.

1287
01:37:31,952 --> 01:37:32,592
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah.

1288
01:37:32,592 --> 01:37:33,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1289
01:37:33,072 --> 01:37:40,115
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm saying this Russia thing that's handed down is because all these other gaming companies pulled out of Russia after the Ukraine invasion.

1290
01:37:40,115 --> 01:37:40,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean,

1291
01:37:42,617 --> 01:37:54,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to give advice to like, you know, dictators or anything, but like, if you're gonna go the route of making your own console, we can really, you know,

1292
01:37:56,426 --> 01:38:04,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we really need to take a page out of one of the greatest console manufacturers on the planet.

1293
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:05,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

1294
01:38:05,230 --> 01:38:06,250
[SPEAKER_07]: What is he going to say?

1295
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Soldier Boy.

1296
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1297
01:38:08,051 --> 01:38:19,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to really follow Soldier Boy's example here and just, you know, grab something off AliExpress and just, you know, rebrand, rebrand.

1298
01:38:19,116 --> 01:38:20,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're there you go.

1299
01:38:20,136 --> 01:38:23,137
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your console right away.

1300
01:38:23,137 --> 01:38:24,298
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no R&D needed.

1301
01:38:28,973 --> 01:38:30,275
[SPEAKER_08]: How about... Okay.

1302
01:38:40,097 --> 01:38:48,060
[SPEAKER_09]: From that story to our last story tonight, where we look at a very special anniversary happening in gaming this week.

1303
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:52,762
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually happened a few days ago, so you probably saw some lines crossing your social media feed.

1304
01:38:52,762 --> 01:38:58,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But as of April 2nd, five days ago, Final Fantasy VI turned 30 years old.

1305
01:39:01,466 --> 01:39:08,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, this was... You are old, you're very old, oldie.

1306
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:11,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet your hairs are gray.

1307
01:39:11,751 --> 01:39:13,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's not funny.

1308
01:39:13,852 --> 01:39:17,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be older soon.

1309
01:39:17,794 --> 01:39:18,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what?

1310
01:39:18,615 --> 01:39:20,356
[SPEAKER_09]: We all are getting older.

1311
01:39:20,356 --> 01:39:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no, but I'm going to have another number.

1312
01:39:23,317 --> 01:39:26,799
[SPEAKER_09]: You are older right now than you were at the beginning of the show.

1313
01:39:26,799 --> 01:39:28,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guess what?

1314
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:28,580
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit.

1315
01:39:32,096 --> 01:39:40,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, I don't know, kind of having pre-birthday blues, so that makes me feel even older.

1316
01:39:40,707 --> 01:39:45,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh hey, sorry to jump back to a previous topic here.

1317
01:39:45,954 --> 01:39:48,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just saw that in tags they have season number?

1318
01:39:49,636 --> 01:39:50,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Could that possibly work?

1319
01:39:50,797 --> 01:39:52,879
[SPEAKER_07]: We had season two episodes.

1320
01:39:52,879 --> 01:39:54,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to look.

1321
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see that there, but maybe I'll look that up.

1322
01:39:57,304 --> 01:40:02,369
[SPEAKER_09]: First time first time chatter in our chat room, Martello4 says, Bitch, I'm looking finest wine.

1323
01:40:02,369 --> 01:40:09,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, you can you can you can pay a lot of money to have have Botox injections and those sorts of things.

1324
01:40:09,596 --> 01:40:10,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1325
01:40:10,357 --> 01:40:10,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all.

1326
01:40:10,697 --> 01:40:11,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to know something, Rob?

1327
01:40:11,998 --> 01:40:12,178
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1328
01:40:12,879 --> 01:40:15,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be getting Botox injections anyway.

1329
01:40:15,621 --> 01:40:17,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are like headaches.

1330
01:40:17,683 --> 01:40:20,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there are medical uses.

1331
01:40:20,285 --> 01:40:26,930
[SPEAKER_09]: They use Botox for it, because, you know, I I don't work in health care anymore, so I feel a little more comfortably talking about this.

1332
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:28,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to work in health care and they will do Botox.

1333
01:40:28,872 --> 01:40:29,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1334
01:40:29,072 --> 01:40:30,253
[SPEAKER_09]: For headaches is the number one.

1335
01:40:30,253 --> 01:40:31,093
[SPEAKER_09]: They can also do it.

1336
01:40:31,093 --> 01:40:34,256
[SPEAKER_09]: They do it for people that have excessive sweating underarms.

1337
01:40:34,256 --> 01:40:34,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1338
01:40:34,516 --> 01:40:38,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the place because it it stops the I mean, I do I do watch.

1339
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: My Dr. Lee, my Dr. Pimple Popper.

1340
01:40:42,362 --> 01:40:49,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Botox, literally the word, it's botulism toxin.

1341
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:51,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's literally a toxin.

1342
01:40:51,206 --> 01:40:58,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, what I wanted to say is I saw this woman this week with the most botched Botox I've ever seen in my life.

1343
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:04,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Like her lips were not, her doctor was not kind or she went somewhere unlicensed.

1344
01:41:04,874 --> 01:41:07,155
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in the lips.

1345
01:41:08,055 --> 01:41:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy VI turned 30 this week.

1346
01:41:28,306 --> 01:41:31,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, a lot of people are very happy to remember this.

1347
01:41:31,207 --> 01:41:37,869
[SPEAKER_09]: All of us here in the US, we probably remember this as Final Fantasy III because this was back when Square called them by different numbers and all of this.

1348
01:41:37,869 --> 01:41:56,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious what y'all's memories of Final Fantasy III, playing that, we'll call it that for now, the Super Nintendo cartridge, what your memories of playing that was since, you know, I know we're all in our 40s at this point, you know, going back 30 years, we were, you know, of varying ages and either grade school, high school, whatever, depending where we're at.

1349
01:41:57,875 --> 01:42:02,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, and, uh, well, I remember I loved Final Fantasy 2.

1350
01:42:02,278 --> 01:42:04,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.

1351
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:08,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't I wasn't able to get Final Fantasy 3 right when it came out, right?

1352
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:11,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my parents, like, weren't going to drop that because the cartridges were expensive.

1353
01:42:11,323 --> 01:42:13,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say this cartridge was like 80 bucks.

1354
01:42:13,164 --> 01:42:13,865
[SPEAKER_09]: It was expensive.

1355
01:42:13,865 --> 01:42:15,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

1356
01:42:15,045 --> 01:42:17,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I rented it and took off a week of school.

1357
01:42:17,827 --> 01:42:19,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So cool.

1358
01:42:19,308 --> 01:42:26,632
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend in high school had this, and I remember we went to a sleepover at his house and we were playing this game all night and he was at the point in the game

1359
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:27,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Edgar and Saban

1360
01:42:40,936 --> 01:42:52,742
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I love, so in Final Fantasy XIV, one of the classes in that game, the machinist, is very inspired by Edgar from Final Fantasy VI, and that he actually has the bioblaster, the chainsaw.

1361
01:42:52,742 --> 01:42:59,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're different because it's XIV, it has to be balanced, but it's really cool that it's inspired by all of that.

1362
01:42:59,026 --> 01:43:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I love how that looks, so.

1363
01:43:01,047 --> 01:43:04,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember sitting on the floor in front of our old console style CRT screen.

1364
01:43:17,273 --> 01:43:36,642
[SPEAKER_02]: writing down the lyrics so I would remember what they were and screaming at the TV quite a bit and then just letting the music in, not Figaro, but letting Cyan's music play.

1365
01:43:36,642 --> 01:43:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really, really love that music.

1366
01:43:40,264 --> 01:43:43,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, later on, you know, I did the same thing with Chrono Trigger in Zeal.

1367
01:43:47,284 --> 01:43:49,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

1368
01:43:49,324 --> 01:44:02,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Quest Buster in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network brings up a really excellent part of Final Fantasy 3 that everybody I think remembers the first time they saw this the opera scene of Final Fantasy 3 still sticks with me to this day.

1369
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:05,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, absolutely my god.

1370
01:44:05,308 --> 01:44:12,550
[SPEAKER_09]: That opera scene I feel like was almost like revolutionary in some ways of storytelling and video games like it really, really was.

1371
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they'll ever remake 6 like they did 7?

1372
01:44:15,863 --> 01:44:17,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, no.

1373
01:44:17,244 --> 01:44:19,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so, it would be cool though.

1374
01:44:19,325 --> 01:44:20,326
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think they will.

1375
01:44:20,326 --> 01:44:23,068
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, they did the pixel remaster.

1376
01:44:23,068 --> 01:44:25,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the pixel remaster is surprisingly decent.

1377
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:27,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1378
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:33,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also pointing out, they also did the one that had like, I guess the chibi body remake style.

1379
01:44:33,036 --> 01:44:34,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1380
01:44:34,257 --> 01:44:35,758
[SPEAKER_02]: The handhelds.

1381
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:39,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't like the first mobile release was garbage.

1382
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't like it.

1383
01:44:41,381 --> 01:44:48,445
[SPEAKER_09]: But the pixel remasters are great, especially now that, you know, they're on PlayStation, PC, you know, wherever you want to pick it up, except Xbox.

1384
01:44:48,445 --> 01:44:49,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1385
01:44:49,385 --> 01:44:50,185
[SPEAKER_09]: You can.

1386
01:44:50,185 --> 01:44:52,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Those pixel remasters are really good.

1387
01:44:52,247 --> 01:44:57,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I just also remember there being bored and like, can I suplex the train?

1388
01:44:57,469 --> 01:44:58,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could suplex the train.

1389
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:00,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And my mind was blown.

1390
01:45:00,031 --> 01:45:00,471
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1391
01:45:01,775 --> 01:45:06,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't believe this game is 30 years old, but there it is.

1392
01:45:06,276 --> 01:45:06,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, think of it.

1393
01:45:06,936 --> 01:45:08,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about this.

1394
01:45:08,617 --> 01:45:13,698
[SPEAKER_09]: When this show started.

1395
01:45:13,698 --> 01:45:18,239
[SPEAKER_09]: That game was eight years old.

1396
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:21,220
[SPEAKER_09]: When this show started, that game was eight years old.

1397
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's 30 years old.

1398
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:25,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Just food for thought.

1399
01:45:30,586 --> 01:45:32,510
[SPEAKER_02]: What else does this game and I have in common?

1400
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:33,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We age well.

1401
01:45:36,087 --> 01:45:36,968
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you sell it.

1402
01:45:36,968 --> 01:45:37,708
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1403
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:39,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to our listener round table.

1404
01:45:39,029 --> 01:45:41,270
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to answer your questions in our chat room.

1405
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:46,973
[SPEAKER_09]: We also welcome your phone calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room and your emails.

1406
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,114
[SPEAKER_09]: We get your emails occasionally.

1407
01:45:48,114 --> 01:45:52,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really, especially, you know, we're hitting a big landmark milestone next week with episode 1000.

1408
01:45:52,036 --> 01:45:55,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I would really love to hear from y'all next week.

1409
01:45:55,778 --> 01:45:58,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And if DarkSakura's voice starts to give out, I will read emails too.

1410
01:45:58,960 --> 01:45:59,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to do it.

1411
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:04,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I would, it would really mean a lot to us to hear from some of you, even if you just want to say hi and sign your name, that's fine.

1412
01:46:04,584 --> 01:46:05,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd appreciate it.

1413
01:46:05,444 --> 01:46:08,208
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we have at least one email tonight, right?

1414
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:08,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just one.

1415
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:09,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1416
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:09,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead and read it.

1417
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:10,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1418
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:20,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio team, I'm writing to extend my heartfelt congratulations on reaching a monumental milestone, your 2,000th episode.

1419
01:46:20,474 --> 01:46:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: For many, many years, you've been a dedicated voice for gamers, providing insightful discussions, news, and a platform for the gaming community to connect.

1420
01:46:29,338 --> 01:46:35,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Your passion for the industry and commitment to your listeners is truly inspiring.

1421
01:46:35,761 --> 01:46:40,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Reaching 2,000 episodes is a testament to your... I'm reading it like this for a reason.

1422
01:46:40,683 --> 01:46:47,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading 2,000 episodes is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and loyal audience you've built.

1423
01:46:47,167 --> 01:47:03,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally enjoyed Skye's deft helming of the ship that is the show, DarkSakura's never-suffering fools lightly, and Loki's frequent exasperations with Nintendo, and appreciate the informative and entertaining content you provide.

1424
01:47:03,638 --> 01:47:05,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations once again.

1425
01:47:05,099 --> 01:47:07,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's to many more successful episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

1426
01:47:07,861 --> 01:47:09,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Best regards, Red Entertainment.

1427
01:47:09,642 --> 01:47:11,782
[SPEAKER_02]: This message was brought to you by Google Gemini.

1428
01:47:11,782 --> 01:47:12,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, really.

1429
01:47:12,443 --> 01:47:17,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Google Gemini to write an email to Orange Lounge Radio congratulating them on episode 2000.

1430
01:47:17,004 --> 01:47:20,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I know it's 1000, but I made a typo and ran with it.

1431
01:47:20,264 --> 01:47:22,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1432
01:47:22,725 --> 01:47:25,505
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, I don't want to see any more goddamn A.I.

1433
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:26,285
[SPEAKER_09]: emails.

1434
01:47:26,285 --> 01:47:28,026
[SPEAKER_09]: That's number one.

1435
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:30,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, don't have A.I.

1436
01:47:30,086 --> 01:47:31,466
[SPEAKER_09]: generate the email.

1437
01:47:31,466 --> 01:47:31,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Write it.

1438
01:47:31,907 --> 01:47:33,247
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to hear it in your own words.

1439
01:47:33,247 --> 01:47:33,747
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to

1440
01:47:34,966 --> 01:47:37,147
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need a template or something, then fine.

1441
01:47:37,147 --> 01:47:39,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Or give me an idea what it should look like, then fine.

1442
01:47:39,729 --> 01:47:41,029
[SPEAKER_09]: But please make sure the voice is your own.

1443
01:47:41,029 --> 01:47:44,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how it picked all of this stuff from us.

1444
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:53,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, if you go and ask, like, if you go to, like, I can't even just do this right now because I was actually checking earlier.

1445
01:47:54,036 --> 01:47:58,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, I wasn't using ChatGP, but like Microsoft kind of has their own thing now, right?

1446
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:07,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually had looked, I was doing longest running video game podcast earlier, and it actually runs this little AI thing on the side here.

1447
01:48:07,345 --> 01:48:11,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And it actually says one of the longest running video game podcasts is Orange Lounge Radio.

1448
01:48:11,548 --> 01:48:16,311
[SPEAKER_09]: It still says we're 18 years, but I know that's because it was in the podcast description that way for a long time.

1449
01:48:16,311 --> 01:48:21,174
[SPEAKER_09]: But here we are hosted by DarkSakura, my old name Sky, but Rob Roberts is there, Loki.

1450
01:48:21,174 --> 01:48:21,975
[SPEAKER_09]: We cover all this.

1451
01:48:21,975 --> 01:48:23,316
[SPEAKER_09]: We won a podcast award.

1452
01:48:23,316 --> 01:48:23,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually,

1453
01:48:24,356 --> 01:48:26,859
[SPEAKER_09]: It's- Oh, how dare you, ChatGTP!

1454
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:30,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much all this- What did ChatGTP tell you was a different show?

1455
01:48:30,202 --> 01:48:31,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Giant Bombcast.

1456
01:48:31,543 --> 01:48:34,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's what- That's what Google says it is, too.

1457
01:48:34,045 --> 01:48:34,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're liars.

1458
01:48:34,806 --> 01:48:38,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my- So, Microsoft Copilot's the winner, to be honest.

1459
01:48:38,149 --> 01:48:41,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So... There it is.

1460
01:48:41,952 --> 01:48:42,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

1461
01:48:42,993 --> 01:48:43,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I switched to the wrong screen.

1462
01:48:43,874 --> 01:48:45,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna fix this right the fuck now.

1463
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:45,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1464
01:48:45,616 --> 01:48:47,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you- Are you reporting?

1465
01:48:47,678 --> 01:48:47,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Error.

1466
01:48:48,857 --> 01:48:49,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha!

1467
01:48:49,917 --> 01:48:52,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I said Orange Lounge Radio is older than Giant Bombcast.

1468
01:48:52,498 --> 01:48:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: You are correct.

1469
01:48:54,018 --> 01:48:58,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is indeed an older podcast compared to the Giant Bombcast.

1470
01:48:58,279 --> 01:49:06,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio started in April 2002, making it one of the longest-running podcasts in the gaming community.

1471
01:49:06,701 --> 01:49:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: It focuses on video games and related topics and has been consistently producing episodes for many years.

1472
01:49:12,462 --> 01:49:14,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing that to my attention.

1473
01:49:14,922 --> 01:49:16,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You are fucking welcome, ChadGTV.

1474
01:49:19,966 --> 01:49:23,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not forget it.

1475
01:49:23,768 --> 01:49:24,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't forget.

1476
01:49:24,449 --> 01:49:27,751
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I just said.

1477
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saving this.

1478
01:49:28,471 --> 01:49:32,434
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.

1479
01:49:32,434 --> 01:49:34,115
[SPEAKER_07]: They started theirs 10 years later.

1480
01:49:34,115 --> 01:49:37,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So their podcast started April 2012.

1481
01:49:37,777 --> 01:49:43,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't ask the question, what is the longest running podcast that people actually know about?

1482
01:49:43,621 --> 01:49:47,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, what is the longest running podcast on video games?

1483
01:49:47,563 --> 01:49:49,265
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says if you send haikus you get bonus kudos.

1484
01:49:49,265 --> 01:49:50,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I would agree with that.

1485
01:49:50,025 --> 01:49:51,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Podculture suggests AI haikus.

1486
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:52,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I take chocolate if you want to send me chocolate.

1487
01:50:08,354 --> 01:50:10,275
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1488
01:50:36,112 --> 01:50:45,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody shows you how to hack those systems to run a bootleg online thing, which I'm sure will be coming around at some point.

1489
01:50:45,277 --> 01:50:48,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf wants to point out, be careful using ChatGPT.

1490
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:51,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Be very vigilant with ChatGPT doing Python scripts.

1491
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:54,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It hallucinates packages that don't exist.

1492
01:50:54,161 --> 01:50:57,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And some people have actually created those packages with malware.

1493
01:50:57,863 --> 01:50:59,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very careful.

1494
01:50:59,324 --> 01:51:04,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I go through and basically just run it for functionality before I plug it in to run on my Mac.

1495
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:05,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Smart.

1496
01:51:07,288 --> 01:51:13,372
[SPEAKER_09]: SGO100Mad is going to send off the 3DS, I'm assuming, with some Mario Kart later.

1497
01:51:13,372 --> 01:51:23,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you're going to play Mario Kart on the Wii U, I mean, they remade that for Switch anyway, so... Anyway, I guess that's it.

1498
01:51:23,858 --> 01:51:25,440
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a lot of other questions.

1499
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That was our last email.

1500
01:51:27,301 --> 01:51:28,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't see anybody in the green room.

1501
01:51:28,842 --> 01:51:29,122
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it.

1502
01:51:29,122 --> 01:51:32,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Our only email.

1503
01:51:32,504 --> 01:51:33,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Alas.

1504
01:51:33,585 --> 01:51:34,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Until next week.

1505
01:51:34,565 --> 01:51:35,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week.

1506
01:51:36,172 --> 01:51:37,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of a big deal.

1507
01:51:37,553 --> 01:51:38,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It's episode 1000.

1508
01:51:38,353 --> 01:51:47,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to all of you out there who have listened, whether tonight was your first night or you've been listening for a very long time.

1509
01:51:47,477 --> 01:51:49,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, thank you all so much for being a part of it.

1510
01:51:49,317 --> 01:51:53,859
[SPEAKER_09]: It's you guys showing up here week after week that gives us the incentive to do this.

1511
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:58,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, it doesn't take a lot of people.

1512
01:51:58,061 --> 01:51:59,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly not.

1513
01:51:59,161 --> 01:52:02,842
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have as many listeners as, um, what was the show the chat should be?

1514
01:52:02,842 --> 01:52:03,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Bombcast?

1515
01:52:03,382 --> 01:52:04,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Giant Bombcast.

1516
01:52:04,563 --> 01:52:10,224
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have that many listeners, but we love those of you that do show up and y'all make this worth it.

1517
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:11,005
[SPEAKER_09]: 999 times over.

1518
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:23,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's because of you all that we're hitting such a huge landmark, really historic and unprecedented milestone next week of 1,000 episodes.

1519
01:52:23,248 --> 01:52:31,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The only other gaming shows that have hit 1,000 episodes do it because they've... And I don't want to diminish anyone's accomplishments.

1520
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:32,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not here to do that.

1521
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:33,791
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fantastic.

1522
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:40,413
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, we are the first to do a weekly release show that hits 1,000 episodes, and that's a huge...

1523
01:52:40,993 --> 01:52:43,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge milestone for us and I'm very excited for it.

1524
01:52:43,935 --> 01:52:46,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's enough of a milestone to make me look at my life choices.

1525
01:52:46,777 --> 01:52:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1526
01:52:47,517 --> 01:52:49,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1527
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,280
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's it's a great ride.

1528
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:52,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1529
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I'm I'm digging in a weird way.

1530
01:52:54,982 --> 01:53:00,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe some of this talk should be saved for next week, but in a weird way, I feel like I've learned a lot.

1531
01:53:00,426 --> 01:53:00,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1532
01:53:00,806 --> 01:53:02,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1533
01:53:02,167 --> 01:53:06,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, the most important thing is the friends we make along the way, which is true.

1534
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:06,810
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1535
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:10,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It's accurate.

1536
01:53:10,494 --> 01:53:14,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's and it's not just you and Matt, which is, of course, an important part of that.

1537
01:53:14,677 --> 01:53:20,901
[SPEAKER_09]: But like the cool thing is, and people have commented on this, it's like you go to a city and you know people there already.

1538
01:53:20,901 --> 01:53:27,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when I go to New York, it might just be a couple of people I meet up with, like Matt, YYR, Ranma.

1539
01:53:27,026 --> 01:53:30,449
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's like I know people in New York because of the show.

1540
01:53:30,449 --> 01:53:33,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people in other cities and other conventions I go to.

1541
01:53:33,391 --> 01:53:36,433
[SPEAKER_09]: When I went to MAGFest in D.C., I ran into people because of the show.

1542
01:53:36,433 --> 01:53:38,355
[SPEAKER_09]: When I went to Chicago, I know people because of the show.

1543
01:53:38,795 --> 01:53:42,256
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go to John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza, we run into people.

1544
01:53:42,256 --> 01:53:47,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's like, you know, kind of having those connections literally around the world is incredible.

1545
01:53:47,857 --> 01:54:02,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember going to visit my mom and my family and then going into Pensacola for like a DDR thing that my friend was doing and there being people like, oh my God, hi, we listened to you.

1546
01:54:02,601 --> 01:54:03,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh my God, hi.

1547
01:54:05,223 --> 01:54:06,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was an experience.

1548
01:54:06,786 --> 01:54:07,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, very humbling thing.

1549
01:54:07,907 --> 01:54:08,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1550
01:54:08,328 --> 01:54:12,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when we were waiting in line for the Wii and somebody was listening to our show.

1551
01:54:12,274 --> 01:54:12,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1552
01:54:12,455 --> 01:54:12,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1553
01:54:16,175 --> 01:54:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, well, me and, wait, for the, yeah, me and Chris were, were waiting.

1554
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:23,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1555
01:54:23,596 --> 01:54:25,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we bribed everyone with donuts.

1556
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:26,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1557
01:54:26,177 --> 01:54:28,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1558
01:54:28,037 --> 01:54:28,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Memories.

1559
01:54:28,797 --> 01:54:34,818
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do more reminiscing next week, but I did just want to say, you know, this is, this is the last triple digit episode of OLR.

1560
01:54:34,818 --> 01:54:38,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that's been, so the first one would have been episode 100.

1561
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:41,859
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been about 20 years worth of triple digit episodes.

1562
01:54:41,859 --> 01:54:44,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And starting next week, it's going to be, we literally broke

1563
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:56,568
[SPEAKER_09]: the system by getting I guess I should I guess I should call some of the other shows that have gotten to a thousand episodes and ask like, what did you do about the metadata?

1564
01:54:56,568 --> 01:54:57,789
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't give a shit about that.

1565
01:54:57,789 --> 01:54:58,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, probably.

1566
01:54:58,789 --> 01:54:59,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1567
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:00,391
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1568
01:55:00,391 --> 01:55:03,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, also, funny thing.

1569
01:55:03,533 --> 01:55:06,775
[SPEAKER_02]: If you add nine plus nine plus nine, it equals 27.

1570
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:09,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you add two plus seven, it's nine.

1571
01:55:10,482 --> 01:55:12,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, any multiple of 9 will add up to 9.

1572
01:55:12,803 --> 01:55:14,203
[SPEAKER_07]: You can keep doing that.

1573
01:55:14,203 --> 01:55:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep adding all the digits over and over and over again until you eventually get to 9.

1574
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:20,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the 9est 9 that ever 9ed.

1575
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:24,046
[SPEAKER_09]: If you add 9 and 9... Except for me, I'm a 10.

1576
01:55:24,046 --> 01:55:31,048
[SPEAKER_09]: If you add 9 and 9 and 9, you get 27, which is the age I like to lie to people and say I am.

1577
01:55:31,048 --> 01:55:31,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1578
01:55:31,748 --> 01:55:34,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can be 29, like Bobby Blackwolf.

1579
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:39,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be like, listen up, 90s.

1580
01:55:39,345 --> 01:55:44,552
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand is talking.

1581
01:55:44,552 --> 01:55:46,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, listen up, tens.

1582
01:55:46,214 --> 01:55:48,177
[SPEAKER_09]: You podcast in your tens of episodes.

1583
01:55:48,177 --> 01:55:49,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen up, tens.

1584
01:55:49,018 --> 01:55:50,059
[SPEAKER_09]: A thousand is speaking.

1585
01:55:50,942 --> 01:55:51,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

1586
01:55:51,402 --> 01:55:52,243
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

1587
01:55:52,243 --> 01:55:57,827
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, like I said earlier, again, I'm never here to diminish anyone else's achievements.

1588
01:55:57,827 --> 01:56:03,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think any podcast that gets to 10 episodes, quite frankly, is a huge accomplishment.

1589
01:56:03,912 --> 01:56:07,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a testament to our level of boredom, everyone.

1590
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:14,703
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're bored enough, you too can have a thousand episodes every, you know, after weeks.

1591
01:56:14,703 --> 01:56:22,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DarkSakura, the answer I always give, what has kept you motivated throughout 900- Spite.

1592
01:56:22,689 --> 01:56:24,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Spite.

1593
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:24,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Spite.

1594
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:26,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Spite.

1595
01:56:26,051 --> 01:56:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Spite.

1596
01:56:27,712 --> 01:56:29,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I do is motivated by spite.

1597
01:56:29,453 --> 01:56:31,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most everything.

1598
01:56:31,755 --> 01:56:36,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And on that note, DarkSakura, I know you're going to go do your thing in Dead by Daylight.

1599
01:56:36,858 --> 01:56:39,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

1600
01:56:40,615 --> 01:56:44,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Rejects false icons and come spend my birthday with me.

1601
01:56:44,456 --> 01:56:45,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1602
01:56:45,896 --> 01:56:47,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up.

1603
01:56:47,177 --> 01:56:47,677
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1604
01:56:47,677 --> 01:56:48,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming up.

1605
01:56:48,397 --> 01:56:49,857
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see in a little bit.

1606
01:56:49,857 --> 01:56:51,357
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see in a little bit.

1607
01:56:51,357 --> 01:56:52,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Later taters!

1608
01:56:52,718 --> 01:56:56,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I turn it over to Loki, of course, I want to thank everybody for listening to this episode.

1609
01:56:56,739 --> 01:57:04,601
[SPEAKER_09]: As always, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Dawn Radio, please help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1610
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:05,421
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell a friend or two.

1611
01:57:06,621 --> 01:57:13,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Tag some folks on social media that may not know we're getting to a thousand episodes and let them know because it is kind of a neat thing.

1612
01:57:13,869 --> 01:57:15,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So help us spread the word.

1613
01:57:15,912 --> 01:57:20,277
[SPEAKER_09]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we want more voices put out on air.

1614
01:57:20,277 --> 01:57:21,418
[SPEAKER_09]: We want a thousand voices.

1615
01:57:21,818 --> 01:57:29,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week for our show, but you know what I'll take 40 to be quite honest live if that's what we can get But I appreciate it.

1616
01:57:29,186 --> 01:57:30,347
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really about the numbers.

1617
01:57:30,347 --> 01:57:34,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about All of you and the great vibes here every week.

1618
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:37,595
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much Okay, now that I got that out Loki your final thought tonight

1619
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:45,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, my final thought is I was just checking, you know, because we were talking about like, hey, does podcasting get to 10 episodes or whatever?

1620
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:50,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Our channel 64 chats, which is now on Spotify, is reached episode 13.

1621
01:57:50,643 --> 01:57:52,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, for real?

1622
01:57:52,405 --> 01:57:53,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know that was a thing.

1623
01:57:53,385 --> 01:57:54,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that you're on that?

1624
01:57:55,163 --> 01:58:01,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm on that because we we do chats every month or so.

1625
01:58:01,025 --> 01:58:06,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's under Spotify is CH64 chats is what it's listed as.

1626
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1627
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:08,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about Minecraft stuff.

1628
01:58:08,909 --> 01:58:09,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy.

1629
01:58:10,066 --> 01:58:12,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sounds good.

1630
01:58:12,407 --> 01:58:13,507
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought tonight.

1631
01:58:13,507 --> 01:58:14,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a lot.

1632
01:58:14,647 --> 01:58:18,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, you know, again, I'm just feeling I'm feeling really good about this accomplishment.

1633
01:58:18,469 --> 01:58:20,309
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of staring down right now.

1634
01:58:20,309 --> 01:58:23,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I just want to thank everybody who's ever kind of joined along for the ride.

1635
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:25,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.

1636
01:58:25,291 --> 01:58:28,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, don't stare directly into the sun tomorrow.

1637
01:58:29,172 --> 01:58:31,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and hopefully when the eclipse happens, you know what?

1638
01:58:31,933 --> 01:58:37,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people are saying that the solar eclipse is going to be the end of the world because you know, they say everything's gonna be the fucking end of the world.

1639
01:58:37,655 --> 01:58:39,076
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that the last time.

1640
01:58:39,076 --> 01:58:40,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

1641
01:58:40,056 --> 01:58:47,819
[SPEAKER_09]: With the luck I've had in my life, the week we're scheduled to hit 1000 episodes would be the week that the world ends.

1642
01:58:47,819 --> 01:58:51,961
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the world does end tomorrow during the eclipse, don't stare directly in the sun.

1643
01:58:51,961 --> 01:58:55,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be like a former president and stare directly into the sun.

1644
01:58:55,282 --> 01:58:57,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say it was really lovely knowing you all.

1645
01:59:01,107 --> 01:59:03,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can't stare into the sun because cool guys don't look at explosions.

1646
01:59:03,908 --> 01:59:06,089
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, right.

1647
01:59:06,089 --> 01:59:06,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, everybody.

1648
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:11,452
[SPEAKER_09]: We will see you next week for episode number 1000.

1649
01:59:11,452 --> 01:59:13,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.
