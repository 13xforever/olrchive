9639	12160	Nintendo's enforcement of its properties tends to come in waves.
12160	18581	Viral fan Project Darlings are shut down quickly, but others that exist below the radar tend to grow until getting caught in a sweep of types of major offenders.
18581	26463	It's my hypothesis that Nintendo properties being taken down from Garry's Mod is part of these sweeps, either because of the big-end success in Hollywood, generative AI's growth, or both.
26463	28824	Unlicensed constructible elements are seeing the axe.
28824	37026	This is the Litigation Headline, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
40242	47766	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47766	58253	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with our 1000th and second episode
59273	63235	for tonight, April the 28th of 2004.
63235	71380	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here every week with you all for 1000 plus weeks with my co host say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
71380	72040	Hello.
72040	72360	Hello.
72360	72660	Hello.
72660	73401	Hello.
73401	74041	Hello, governor.
74041	76142	Hello.
76142	77243	How are you doing?
77243	77883	Yeah.
77883	78603	All right.
78603	81285	Just you know, it's been a day.
81684	82745	Kind of a tiring day.
82745	82925	Yeah.
82925	83625	It's been a day.
83625	84145	I hear you.
84145	89148	I feel very, I was out in the sun today and that can be a very dehydrating experience.
89148	91509	I was playing games IRL.
91509	97432	I got together with some of my friends from the game Ingress and we were up to no good getting points for our team.
97432	100954	It's actually a lot of good, but you know, it's, it's, it's work.
100954	102174	It's hard work playing games.
102174	103775	IRL is hard work.
103775	106657	Let me tell you, but I guess exercise, et cetera.
106657	107157	It's all good.
107157	107317	Right.
109312	114385	We'll say hello to somebody else who maybe has gotten some exercise in if he ever dusts off that machine in his garage.
114385	115828	It's Tech Master Loki.
116604	117945	It's not just us anymore.
117945	120206	It's also things being stored on top of it.
120206	122447	Oh, it's gotten to that point.
122447	127429	It's just, it's just, it's just Legos sitting there.
127429	128970	Legos?
128970	137514	Well, it's because I had to... By the way, for those that don't know, I'm talking about Loki has a Dance Dance Revolution machine in his garage.
137514	138014	I do.
138014	138875	I do.
138875	140555	And I do want to use it.
140555	141176	I just have to...
142452	151160	do one of those like bulky trash pickups or whatever because we have a bunch of stuff in the garage that needs to be like thrown out and then the stuff can come off of the dance pads.
151160	151920	It's not a lot.
151920	166053	It's just like a couple things of a couple containers of Legos that I've had to move around stuff from like back, you know, pre pandemic when I had to move stuff from my desk, which had a ton of Legos there.
166053	166273	Yeah.
167182	168643	Use that annual trash pickup.
168643	172726	That was a godsend when we were moving to come pick up all the crap we were purging.
172726	173507	My goodness.
173507	179731	Yeah, the thing with that is like they always ask you for the account number and I'm one that like after I pay bills, I throw them away.
179731	182893	And so it's like, you know, oh, hey, I need to do the bulky trash pickup.
182893	183894	Oh, I threw that bill away.
183894	185956	Now I got to wait another two months for the bill to come.
187179	190220	You know, and then the process just repeats itself.
190220	192881	You know, I'll pay it, and then I'll realize, oh yeah, I was gonna do that.
192881	194121	Oh, that's right, I threw it away again.
194121	195481	Pay it online.
195481	198262	Then you get the account number online whenever you need it.
198262	202083	I don't, I tried that once, actually, and I couldn't.
202083	203924	Are you still writing checks in the year 2024?
203924	204884	No.
204884	211646	No, I paid them through my bank, but like, it's just, they send the checks to them.
211646	214087	I don't, no, I'm not writing checks.
214087	214547	God, what?
215387	217688	I'm not that old.
217688	222529	You still they still want you to send in a check and it's like older services.
222529	230971	Alan, Alan just got a new checkbook and he was showing me he's like, look, they all have little cats on them because of course he got the checkbook where all the cats are printed on the checks.
230971	233832	And I was like, I still have to pay for ballet by check.
233832	235773	I was like, what the fuck do you need a checkbook for?
235773	240294	But there's there's that very random occasional one or two things that yeah.
242054	245876	You can still do that through your bank and it doesn't cost anything.
245876	258200	They have like a bill pay option that you do that and they cut checks them or if they have like, you know, like say Comcast or something like that, they have it set up where it's electronic because they have them in their system or something.
258200	259281	But for everybody else, you can
260233	261634	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
280643	282404	You told us, but we can't tell you.
282404	283745	It's like, thanks.
283745	284805	You're not helpful.
284805	289908	So and then like I never made online accounts with all these different utilities.
289908	294351	As far as I remember, I may have like when I moved in here back in 2009.
294351	297833	Like, I'm not going to remember that stuff.
297833	298553	So.
298553	299374	All right.
299374	302275	That's why you got to keep spreadsheets with all of your stuff on it.
302275	304497	I mean, that don't you don't do that.
304497	305597	Yeah.
305597	308199	No, I don't even have that.
308199	308299	No.
308999	311021	That's very... I don't know.
311021	313204	I keep spreadsheets for so many things.
313746	321313	Spreadsheets with all your personal information and account numbers sounds like a perfect thing for a hacker to do.
321313	323335	Not when you also have it encrypted.
323335	330561	Not when it's behind one of those laser beam security things like in the movie Entrapment with Catherine Zeta-Jones.
330561	332943	That's the type of security.
332943	337608	And a very ferocious Minna the Cat stands between you and that.
337608	339629	I'm also a very big fan of encryption.
340510	347757	Alright, our chatters are dying to weigh in on this, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific.
347757	354583	The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, that's V-O-G Network, also available at vognetwork.com.
354583	363832	And y'all can chime in with your thoughts, saying Bobby Blackwolf talking about Loki's DDR machine and the Legos saying, the good news is that if there's stuff on top of it, there's no dust on it.
364452	365193	Good point.
365193	388928	Yeah, well, I did check it like I have used it since then and I think it was a few months ago I powered it on just to make sure it was still working Yeah, I mean it doesn't get super dusty in our garage because we don't I don't ever open the garage door at all So it's just whatever is inside the garage Yeah, it's not it's not like covered in dust anything it's just sitting there waiting
390070	392131	As Stuart Hunter Matt says, not a drying rack.
392131	393991	Done that with a DDR machine before.
393991	395872	Ha ha ha.
395872	397152	No, we have our own drying rack.
397152	398552	Proper use for the bars.
398552	400173	That's for sure.
400173	400453	Let's see.
400453	403394	And then folks are talking about paper checks.
403394	409035	Bobby is saying, I usually pay contractors with checks because then they don't charge me the 3% credit card fee.
409035	411035	Well, that makes sense if they're going to charge a fee.
411035	414396	But a lot of times they'll still take debit card and not charge the fee.
414396	414856	It depends.
414856	415857	It depends on what it is.
415857	416537	Really depends on what it is.
417757	424400	Let's see, and Questbuster says, I was not expecting an Entrapment movie reference.
424400	427401	I'm going to make more obscure movie references more often.
427401	430363	Although I don't think I would consider that movie particularly obscure.
430363	432423	I get that it's old.
432423	438146	And let's see, Tigerclaw had asked earlier, anyone watch the Knuckles series this weekend?
438146	440487	If you have Paramount+, it was really good.
440487	443648	I know Tigerclaw is a supremo top tier Sonic fan.
445709	451074	I have Paramount Plus, but I just, I was, we were hosting, I had, I hosted a show last night here locally.
451074	453296	So took up a good chunk of my weekend.
453296	453857	Yeah, I know.
453857	454117	I know.
454117	455178	It just really struck me funny.
455178	457320	If you have Paramount Plus, it's really good.
457320	458961	Is it still good if you don't have Paramount Plus?
458961	461423	Yes, because you can pirate it.
461423	463746	Which is what I'm sure a lot of people are doing.
463746	465007	I didn't care that much.
465467	468369	Yeah, I'm not opposed to watching it.
468369	473751	I just didn't get around like I watch very little TV and I just didn't get around to it this weekend with the other stuff going on.
473751	477933	Have you gotten around to watching any of the Sonic movies?
477933	479274	No.
479274	482136	Okay, well then yeah, there's no reason to watch Knuckles right now.
482136	482956	I need to catch up.
482956	483997	You're too far behind.
483997	484777	I'm not opposed.
484777	493842	Again, I just you know, I just video video games are my media of choice usually unless I'm stuck on an airplane and can't do anything else but watch a damn movie then
494907	495888	Thank you for watching!
511007	513569	Children, you're appearing in the green screen in the background.
513569	517212	Please stop.
517212	519013	All right.
519013	521996	You need to make them wear green shirts on Sunday nights.
521996	522896	Green shirts.
522896	524117	Yeah, that'd be funny.
524117	525138	So they just look like a head.
525138	528881	And then when someone asks, Hey, is that ghost behind you?
528881	529702	Yeah, probably.
530684	534669	Bobby Blackwolf says, has Paramount Plus not cracked down on password sharing like everyone else?
534669	537712	They probably have, but here's the thing.
537712	542037	Loki would get through the series before I would have a need to use Paramount Plus again.
542037	545000	When's Drag Race All Stars 9 starts?
545000	547323	Maybe, but I don't even really watch Drag Race anymore.
547323	549104	I watched maybe one episode of this last season.
550045	552767	I just binged all the way through All Stars 8.
552767	554587	Or 7, sorry.
554587	556568	8 isn't on Apple TV yet.
556568	559190	Do they release all the episodes at once?
559190	561991	Or is it just one of the... Oh, Knuckles?
561991	564232	I think Knuckles was, yes.
564232	567274	But not every show is released all at once.
567274	568554	I'll watch it eventually.
568554	572556	I'm not super into the lore stuff.
572556	574877	I usually just watch it because the movies are pretty good.
574877	575698	I like Jim Carrey.
576610	583073	I'm sure he's not in the Knuckles series, so... I'll watch the third movie.
583073	584014	I mean, I don't know.
584014	592238	I did notice the guy from Happy Endings, Adam Pally, who I think is my favorite gay representation character ever in a show.
592238	604064	If you ever saw the show Happy Endings, he played the gay guy in that show, which I think is the best representation because I really felt myself in that because he was not like Will and Jack, okay?
604064	604704	He was like...
606883	612925	Nerdy, slobby, like all this, like just like a, but, but just was gay.
612925	615246	So I was like, you mean like everybody?
615246	615726	That's right.
615726	616126	That's right.
616126	618407	He was a normal person, but gay.
618407	622528	So that was my favorite representation, honestly.
622528	625890	He's in that series I saw in one of the previews.
625890	627150	So I was like, Oh, I'm a fan of him.
627150	628090	He's pretty funny.
628090	630191	So yeah.
630191	632152	All right.
632152	632532	Let's see.
634079	645613	Moving on, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which isn't about TV shows, but it is about some rumors that are getting louder and louder about Nintendo's next Switch.
645613	649058	Loki, let's talk about this and why this might have some credit to it.
649998	659509	Yeah, so then there's a lot of rumors talking about leaks regarding what the switch it to some of the features might be.
659509	664594	I think these were coming from third party accessory makers.
664594	668599	But essentially saying it is coming from hardware, just makers basically.
669226	669886	Hardware Makers.
669886	671227	Okay.
671227	681612	So essentially, there, you know, apparently there's been reports that you know, there's going to be an eight inch 1080p screen developed for it.
681612	690136	One of the other more interesting things is the differences in the joy cons apparently going to be a little bit larger than the previous joy cons.
690136	697900	However, supposed to be still backwards compatible with the old joy cons, but also that they're going to attach magnetically to the system, which
699440	725126	sounds like a recipe for disaster if you ask me because can you imagine holding holding the switch with magnets and then oh this screen just fell out from inside you know like it it just doesn't i'm just gonna store these joy cons on top of my credit card like it just i i like the idea of attaching easier because yeah the the way it slides in is very um tricky sometimes
726061	730268	However, some of that magnet stuff is pretty powerful though, I gotta say.
730268	732131	Yeah, you can get some pretty strong magnets.
732131	735717	It's just... I... That's... It's like...
737086	740127	It's got me worried a little bit.
740127	741247	What else?
741247	757753	There was also rumors that apparently the cartridge, it's going to be backwards compatible with the Switch cartridges, but the Switch 2 cartridges themselves are going to be a different format, but still, I guess, slot into the cartridge slots that they have for that.
757753	758433	Interesting.
758433	759694	And yeah, so...
761074	767560	It'll be interesting to see, you know, what exactly, if any of this is actually true, for one.
767560	771484	I can see a 1080p, because that's not a huge upgrade.
771484	774247	Do you know why I think this is absolutely 100% true?
774247	775087	You know what I think it is?
775968	779650	It is because the upgrades are really not that much.
779650	785714	That's why I'm like, oh, this is the most like conservative sort of report on the upgrades on the switch.
785714	786414	This is it.
786414	787495	This is this is the real deal.
787495	787695	Yeah.
787695	798941	Because like what it sounds like to me is like when they talk about like 1080p output and stuff like that, it's it's essentially you're going to have the games because, you know, they have like the handheld mode and then they have the
799521	816106	Kind of docked mode so essentially on the switch to your switch games are kind of kind of play in that docked mode type of setting where the you know the graphics are be slightly higher, you know 1080p type of thing and The screen size being like I think what an inch larger.
816106	817447	I mean, that's cool.
817447	828710	I like the larger screen idea I'm just curious to see what they do with it You know see see what makes this special I guess yeah, what kind of games they got
829947	834188	or maybe if the magnet thing is kind of a gimmick as well.
834188	846471	Like I still feel like there's probably some sort of physical gimmick that maybe this particular hardware manufacturer is not in on, but there's something maybe either in it, you know, or you know, how like the joy cons had the whole like haptic feedback in it.
846471	849631	So it could feel like you were shaking a jar of marbles or something.
849631	851472	And you would feel that in the controller.
851472	856293	You know, I, there's gotta be some type of gimmick like that, I would imagine, but
857118	878839	Yeah, I don't think like yeah, honestly, I don't think like the magnets are gonna be like a gameplay type thing It's more probably just it's just a way to make the switch joy cons attach easier to the console Yeah, instead of you know having to slide it in there I mean more more so I would be more concerned with it was less attaching the joy cons to the console was more attaching those wrists
880532	882213	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
910853	918003	And so yeah, if you get really mad, start shaking it or something, it could could be interesting, but I'm sure there's got to be.
918003	919305	They put those things through tests.
919305	920166	There's got to be.
920166	924512	They were smart enough to make the Switch cartridges taste funny so that kids wouldn't eat them.
924512	926515	They're going to put them through some type of test.
928817	931398	I mean, I guess.
931398	935779	Then again, I don't know.
935779	938240	Let's see some comments in chat.
938240	941380	SSJ100 Matt says two switches strapped together via magnets.
941380	944361	I don't even think this thing is going to be as powerful as two switches.
944361	947682	You're giving you're giving Nintendo a lot of credit to be quite honest.
947682	951463	Let's see Tiger Claw says, I'm sorry.
951463	956324	It was DarkSakura who said, I'm just ready for the announcement of the announcement trailer for this thing.
956324	957785	Let me give you my money Nintendo.
958425	984348	yeah well that's the other well weren't they saying that like there it actually may be a thing for this year which was kind of shocking uh i don't think so because i don't think it's going to be i just had thought last week on the show well the gamescom announcement pretty much confirms it's not going to happen this year but i think it was a part of this announcement that was saying they're still trying to decide if they want to do later this year early next year like no it's going to be fiscal year this fiscal year yeah we know that i
985589	989412	They would be announcing games around August.
989412	996177	So assuming that if they were going to launch this year, you would have your announcement at least like one or two months in advance.
996177	1003423	So like, say August, Perfect Games comm time launch around October, November would be ideal.
1003423	1004884	I don't think they're going to launch this year.
1004884	1013150	I think they're going to do what they did with the Switch, which is they're going to wait to launch in March, announce in January, February, and
1014690	1015070	DarkSakura
1030957	1031097	Steve
1051670	1055111	was not just having, you know, some decent games at launch.
1055111	1057412	And I would say Breath of the Wild was beyond decent.
1057412	1064374	It was, you know, incredible, but, you know, not just having that, but then having the other games stacked in the pipeline ready to go.
1064374	1069536	And that was the biggest mistake they made with the Wii U. They didn't have that same pipeline ready with the Wii U and look what happened.
1069836	1070156	Nintendo
1088064	1090846	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1104625	1108826	You know, even that would count as something that could still keep that hardware moving.
1108826	1112747	So yeah, I mean, Mike Duff says Metroid Prime 4 launch title.
1112747	1115608	I I could see that as a good launch title.
1115608	1117329	I just don't think that would be enough.
1117329	1120130	I don't think that's going to get people to buy the console.
1120130	1121170	I actually agree.
1121170	1123390	I actually don't think it's a good launch title.
1123390	1126171	And I know that's me, me, me saying that.
1126171	1131373	And I you all know, I stand like Super Metroid in that franchise, but I'm not sure it is quite
1132113	1135294	The most accessible title for the entire family.
1135294	1138656	That is a good launch window title.
1138656	1149020	So, you know, maybe like let's say the Switch does launch in October, then maybe Metroid Prime 4 comes out in December or it's the March game.
1149020	1154022	That's the game that comes out in March to, you know, kind of cap off the year, I think would be a great thing.
1154022	1154442	But I think
1155482	1159628	I, I, doesn't it seem kind of obvious it's going to be some sort of Mario game?
1159628	1160429	Like, like a 3D Mario game?
1160429	1163053	I would think it's, I think, I would think a Mario Odyssey 2.
1163053	1164635	I would think a Mario Odyssey 2 as well.
1165463	1169666	I would think though, like, Prime 4 would be a good holiday title for that first year.
1169666	1179032	So you have the console come out in March, Prime 4 is your holiday title, or one of your holiday titles to come out, because I think that would be a pretty solid title.
1179032	1188598	It's just, it isn't, yeah, it is a more hardcore game for the console, and certainly there is the audience for that.
1188598	1193901	It's just that, you know, that audience isn't going to, say, overlap with people that play Animal Crossing, or, you know, that
1194744	1194907	Um...
1195788	1198430	You know, your casual Mario players or something like that.
1198430	1204533	They're going to want something that like, you know, parents and young kids all get to enjoy together.
1204533	1206675	And that's going to be a Mario type game.
1206675	1209096	Actually, that's the fucking launch title.
1209096	1209596	I'm sorry.
1209596	1210797	They are.
1210797	1219502	If they don't launch with Mario Kart 9 or Mario Kart 10, I guess it would be Mario Kart 10 at this point, because most most I think they've kind of written that the mobile game is Mario Kart 9.
1219502	1224986	So like Mario Kart X, that that has to be the launch title that and that would be the thing that would
1225726	1229313	What is the best fucking selling game on the Switch right now?
1229313	1231958	Like that Mario Kart 10 would be it.
1233618	1236899	Now, there's no reason they can't launch with that and Metroid Prime.
1236899	1238019	That could maybe happen.
1238019	1238739	I could see that.
1238739	1243681	That would be very, you know, like F-Zero and Pilotwings type of thing.
1243681	1247522	But then, you know, Mario World was really what everybody was buying for.
1247522	1248182	Yeah.
1248182	1254583	I mean, Bobby says, yeah, Mario Kart X or 10 would give me to buy a Switch 2 immediately.
1254583	1256944	Anything else, I'd wait.
1256944	1258984	I probably would pick one up right away.
1258984	1260925	I think we got a lot of use out of the Switch.
1261744	1264426	Yeah, I'd pick one up right away just for the fucking upgrades.
1264426	1282803	I'd pick one up right away assuming I am assuming here but if it is if it is verified that it will improve the you know frame rate and you know graphical quality even in some cases on some older games like Pokemon Legends, I'll pick one up immediately just for that.
1284265	1295053	and the most important thing in this day and age of 2024, Nintendo, that the library is transferable to the new system.
1295053	1297495	Because if it's not, that's ridiculous.
1297495	1302419	The rumor, I believe if you look, it does say something about digital backwards compatibility.
1302419	1302839	So let's
1303740	1328540	fucking hope so because I don't want to see them have to do the not virtual console but Nintendo switch online you know the retro things online I don't want to see them have to start that over all over again please no please God no upgrade what you've got with new systems or something I don't know how about GameCube already it's time it's time bring back virtual console man bring it back years let's get GameCube now
1329377	1333800	I honestly think you could make so much more money off virtual console than you could off the subscriptions.
1333800	1343968	Like, in reality, like, it's your $25 a year subscription is essentially three games from for the virtual console.
1343968	1352094	You're telling me that people that your average people, you couldn't get an average of three games sold per person that uses that system.
1352094	1357098	I I'm telling you, man, there's money that they're leaving on the table with that stuff.
1357523	1362186	Well, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, but everyone wanted Netflix for games when we had virtual console.
1362186	1369231	Well, yeah, just like now, it took Target pulling Blu-rays and DVDs for people to say, Oh, man, I wish Target had Blu-rays and DVDs.
1369231	1378516	That's the that's the thing is, yeah, people wanted Netflix of games for, you know, their digital systems.
1378516	1378717	What
1379713	1386160	Nintendo is offering, maybe adding one or two titles every so often, is not Netflix.
1386160	1389304	Like, Netflix is thousands of titles!
1389304	1394530	And there's a huge catalog of games available for all of the Nintendo systems.
1394530	1395711	Nintendo is offering CNN+.
1397868	1403829	They're offering 2B at this point.
1403829	1409650	It's a pittance of what they could offer, and that's the problem right there.
1409650	1411891	It's just not worth it in a sense there.
1411891	1413231	So, okay, that didn't work.
1413231	1414091	We tried.
1414091	1416092	Let's go back to selling that stuff.
1416092	1423173	But then I know that they're so adverse to discounting stuff, but these old virtual console titles, just put them on sale every once in a while.
1423513	1430516	people like myself would like just eat that stuff up and create this huge catalog of stuff that we're just sitting on.
1430516	1432896	But it would still be like, Oh, yeah, cool.
1432896	1443260	I get all this stuff, you know, and you'd make so much more money than $25 a year, like so much more on top.
1443260	1446742	Let me sorry, I'm just getting to some other comments here, Logie.
1446742	1452484	Tigerclaw in chat says, Do you think the switch to will use physical media considering how some stores are doing away with it?
1452484	1452764	Oh, yeah.
1453484	1458487	Well, number one, the rumor is actually confirming it's going to be backwards compatible with the cartridges.
1458487	1461109	So I think from that regard, yes.
1461109	1471516	And I also just think I feel like Nintendo will be the last to drop physical and, you know, insert joke about how their tech lags behind.
1471516	1481423	But I think there's something also about it's not that the kids can't do digital, but I think there's something very, you know, like here's the cartridge or something about that that I don't know.
1481423	1483384	I feel like Nintendo is going to be the last to drop that.
1483404	1489947	Flash memory is getting cheaper and cheaper every day, so you can store a lot more on a lot smaller form factors.
1489947	1494168	I mean, they don't technically need to get away from that.
1512899	1515261	Pixelpacas in chat says, hey, 2B is good.
1515261	1517983	Just watched Death Becomes Her and Romeo and Michelle on it recently.
1517983	1519324	I didn't know Romeo and Michelle was on it.
1519324	1521005	Cute.
1521005	1522587	Let's see.
1522587	1530392	OrangeRight is talking about arcade archives because Bobby was saying, do you really want to pay $5 for Super Mario Brothers again?
1530392	1538639	But very interesting counterpoint from OrangeRight, who says, considering arcade archives versus Super Mario Brothers, because there is a difference.
1538639	1541361	I think you all know the arcade versus Super Mario Brothers.
1541961	1544363	is available in arcade archives on Switch.
1544363	1546225	Only the Switch, not PS5.
1546225	1550849	But Orange Rite reminds us that game is almost always in the top 20.
1550849	1555373	So a lot of people do seem to be buying it all over again.
1555373	1557815	Of course, you know, there are differences.
1557815	1560518	The versus is, of course, a lot harder.
1560518	1564461	But that is some interesting perspective on that, is that arcade archives
1565242	1567343	You know, we were just talking about that last week show.
1567343	1570084	There's hundreds of games in that series.
1570084	1574165	And that is that is the pay what you're going to play type of model.
1574165	1576746	Granted, there's a lot of obscure as fuck games in there.
1576746	1577746	That doesn't make them bad, though.
1577746	1579227	There's some really neat gems.
1579227	1580207	Yeah.
1580207	1587710	I mean, obviously, that takes some money to publish those and get those, you know, ported over and emulated and stuff like that.
1587710	1587950	So
1589901	1610055	I mean, it must be somewhat successful if they're doing so many of them like they wouldn't be doing like 100 some titles if they weren't selling like I just I have a hard time believing that they can't hold the phone here a minute hold the phone Narcissus says I did buy arcade archive Donkey Kong.
1610055	1613758	So depending on how the emulation is, I might buy them piecemeal again.
1613758	1615599	They put Donkey Kong on arcade archives.
1615599	1618942	I didn't know with with the pie factory and everything.
1618942	1619162	That's
1621554	1624155	I need to get that.
1624155	1626475	Do they have what's the other Nintendo a Popeye?
1626475	1627976	I would be so excited.
1627976	1630217	Licensing probably makes that a pain in the ass.
1630217	1635079	But if they have Popeye on what other Nintendo arcade arcade games are there?
1635079	1637900	My God, I didn't know Donkey Kong was in it.
1637900	1640161	I want to play the Pie Factory again.
1640161	1641781	Is Donkey Kong three in it, too?
1641781	1645563	Holy moly.
1645563	1646103	I need to look.
1647594	1648074	Wow.
1648074	1648815	All right.
1648815	1650076	Today I learned.
1650076	1653539	Yes, I'm dusting off my switch to play a game from 1984.
1653539	1654380	All right.
1654380	1660425	Let's move on and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether they are 40 year old games or not.
1660425	1662747	In a segment called How was your gaming week?
1662747	1663868	DarkSakura, we'll go to you.
1663868	1664649	How was your gaming week?
1665948	1668689	Um, a little frustrating to be honest.
1668689	1672331	Um, I did play some Dead by Daylight, of course.
1672331	1684537	I, uh, also played, um, uh, Dracula XX Nocturne in the Moonlight, which was the, uh, original name for, uh, Symphony of the Night.
1684537	1691160	I've been playing the Saturn version and made it to the Upside Down Castle and did some bosses and ran around and
1692805	1697676	Generally causing chaos in Alucard's dad's house.
1697676	1700523	You know, he doesn't like any of the house guests he's got over.
1703187	1715493	I also tried to play my lovely avatar game, but it's been set for, we're patching, try in a couple of hours, for about a week now.
1715493	1723438	And I want to tell everybody something, because instead of going onto the, well, I mean, you can go onto the forums and bitch about it, but file a fucking ticket.
1724318	1730641	That's how anyone in tech gets heat on any freaking type of thing.
1730641	1732682	You have to file a ticket.
1732682	1739265	Tickets go to a report, they compile numbers, and they work on them by order of report.
1739265	1743547	You don't file a ticket, it doesn't get the heat it needs to get.
1743547	1752331	So, on one of those very bored nights when I could not play around with my blue people, I played Islands of Insight.
1753467	1758171	The behavior puzzle MMO weird game.
1758171	1759773	It's weird.
1759773	1768902	But I got to like one of these little islands that had some of my favorite kinds of puzzles and I call it the sort of P.O.P.O.
1768902	1770363	Puzzle.
1770363	1771364	Because you have to get
1772014	1777800	There are four in a row of certain color things and you have to completely clear out the board.
1777800	1780863	So it's a matter of knowing which items to switch around.
1780863	1789052	And you can only switch around things that would lead to a row being deleted.
1789052	1792856	And so you have to look ahead and see how they're going to cascade and fall.
1792856	1794097	Those are my favorite puzzles.
1795629	1811316	There's also some really interesting spatial puzzles that I like, like where you see these rings, and most of them are gold, and then you'll have two that are sort of like a brass patina, you know, that kind of bluish-greenish color?
1811316	1821020	And you have to look through just the gold rings, so you have to stand in just the right angle to see through just the gold without looking through the brass.
1821977	1823658	And that was pretty cool.
1823658	1829880	And like, even some things, like, that don't seem like they're a puzzle at first end up being puzzles.
1829880	1840123	I mean, just everything has hidden puzzle after hidden puzzle and you have follow puzzles, you know, where you have to follow something to a certain perspective and all kinds of fun stuff.
1840123	1842384	It's a really neat game.
1842384	1848086	And I also played a game I'm going to be talking about later, like very soon later.
1850566	1855971	that predates something.
1855971	1857812	Stuff that does stuff.
1857812	1865599	Well, before we go to Loki, I want to follow up on this because a lot of people in chat have been talking about the arcade archives thing with Nintendo.
1865599	1872925	So I actually went to look up what are all of the games that Nintendo has put out on arcade archives or arcade archive games that are published by Nintendo?
1873686	1874947	There's a ton.
1874947	1876048	There's a ton of them.
1876048	1892760	By the way, the Arcade Archive series, 304 games in Arcade Archives, 108 also in Neo Geo, which I mean, that means like the Neo Geo library is like pretty much everything that's ever been on an arcade machine for Neo Geo is in this Arcade Archives, by the way.
1892760	1894381	But get this from Nintendo.
1896398	1899000	I'm going to read the entire list.
1899000	1901162	I had no idea all of these games were on it.
1901162	1901883	Ready?
1901883	1924322	Clue Clueland, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Donkey Kong 3, Excitebike, Golf, Ice Climber, Mario Bros., Pinball, Punch Out, Skyskipper, Soccer, Super Punch Out, Urban Champion, vs. Balloon Fight, vs. Baseball, vs. Mahjong, vs. Super Mario Bros., vs. Tennis, vs. Wrecking Crew.
1925546	1930349	Number one, I had no idea half of those games were even ever arcade things at one point.
1930349	1932111	I mean, I know Nintendo had their pay choice every day.
1932111	1935653	I had no idea half those games were even in them ever.
1935653	1936914	But that's I'm like, what?
1936914	1938375	Mind blown.
1938375	1939656	Popeye not on the list.
1939656	1943539	But again, I'm just assuming that's a more complex licensing sort of thing.
1943539	1944059	There you go.
1944059	1944920	Those are all the games.
1944920	1945420	That's like what?
1945420	1948322	3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20 games by Nintendo in the arcade archives.
1948322	1948402	Wow.
1957565	1958265	I stand corrected.
1958265	1969028	They have come out slowly over the years from 2017 was versus Super Mario Brothers all the way through 2020 was some of the like Super Punch-Out was in 2020.
1969028	1971509	So, wow.
1971509	1974889	All right, shut me up.
1974889	1979190	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says I didn't even know there was an arcade version of Nintendo pinball, right?
1979190	1984552	Neither did I. I never even knew that was in the the the pay choice cabinets.
1984552	1985032	How about that?
1986107	1988448	Nintendo pinball was pretty good.
1988448	1989869	All right, Loki, we can go to your gaming week.
1989869	1995272	Sorry, but very important information, vital information we needed to share.
1995272	1996393	It was important.
1996393	2006338	I basically play the same stuff as I played last week, so I've been playing through still a lot of Turbo Kid and just kind of progressing through that.
2006338	2009340	The game is really, really hard.
2009340	2012742	So it's one of those things I got to a boss now that's like,
2013880	2035078	just it seems very difficult to fight and so I may have to go like other places to get more power-ups because it's a metroidvania and you know that's how that works but I see a lot of parallels with this and obviously metroid you know the the sewer area that I'm in is very you know brinstar and stuff like that so it's um
2036096	2037097	I like it quite a bit.
2037097	2039300	It's a very well done game.
2039300	2040681	I cannot recommend it enough.
2040681	2041622	And then of course Minecraft.
2041622	2045666	I've been actually working on my build for my next episode.
2045666	2048849	I filmed the beginning of it already.
2048849	2050751	The build is done, essentially.
2050751	2053394	It's an arcade slash casino.
2054369	2060836	More casino than arcade, but you know, you can't really make arcade games compact in Minecraft.
2060836	2063159	That just doesn't work.
2063159	2068284	But I've got like a lot of like, I gotta put a DVR machine there, of course.
2068284	2069846	It's lots of lights and stuff.
2069846	2073950	I've been playing with the new shaders that are out for complimentary.
2074991	2090518	Essentially they have colored lighting in there which is like a brand new thing for like Minecraft shaders and stuff and with that though like I've been trying to simulate black light and stuff like that in there and we have a mod called Immersive Paintings which allows us to put in like
2091718	2120700	image files essentially into the game kind of like paintings and so without having to like go and create a custom map art and stuff like that that would take forever to do this is just kind of throw it in there and you can make some really large things so I've got it's coming along pretty good and then the last thing I was doing today was actually setting up the soundscape for it because I set up a bunch of jukeboxes with our custom music discs and stuff so you can put custom audio files on there so I have like
2121840	2126521	I tried doing arcade ambient sounds.
2126521	2128802	Arcade ambient sounds are too loud.
2128802	2134943	I mean, I don't think... I don't remember going to the arcades.
2134943	2142965	It's been a while, but you don't realize how loud arcades are with all the games kind of playing their music and sound effects all at the same time.
2142965	2143525	It's not...
2144702	2155715	great so i have to end up going with like kind of like a casino like ambient sound instead but i have like a fake video game thing and i've got some music that i
2157182	2162045	borrowed from StepMania for the DDR machine that's in the arcade as well.
2162045	2165067	And so all those together kind of sound really cool.
2165067	2168610	I tried to keep it so that the audio is contained within the area of the arcade.
2168610	2173393	So as you come up to it, you kind of hear like what it sounds like walking up to an arcade in a mall or something like that.
2173393	2175914	So it's going to be pretty cool.
2175914	2185301	Way too much detail put into a very small build that was meant to just kind of bridge the gap of time between releasing episodes because I'm still working on enormous
2186158	2193566	Theme Park Ride, which really should have been like so many episodes worth of content that, um, but I, I'm not operating like that.
2193566	2195368	I have to put it all out at once.
2195368	2199253	So it's just taking a very long time to do that.
2199253	2202296	Um, but yeah, they'll be coming out probably this week.
2202296	2202857	All right.
2202857	2202997	Cool.
2204533	2205994	Let's see, my gaming week.
2205994	2207915	You know, the usual, Final Fantasy XIV.
2207915	2209917	I still played a little Dead by Daylight.
2209917	2210817	Go me.
2210817	2212939	Just a little bit, not a lot.
2212939	2216901	And I think I snuck in Diablo IV as well.
2216901	2226407	But the game I probably spent the most amount of time on was continuing, because I talked about it just a little bit last week, Aiden Chronicle, which I had backed on Kickstarter.
2226407	2228948	I've been playing that, continuing through that.
2228948	2231010	I think I'm about 11 or 12 hours in at this point.
2231590	2242203	And so it's definitely, you know, everything I said last week about it's a PlayStation One RPG for better and for worse, kind of still all holds true.
2242203	2249412	One thing that got a little annoying, I don't know if I ran into a bug or what happened, but I got to this part of the game where like no
2250413	2259837	Monsters started spawning for some reason, like it just got to a point where there were no random encounters that ended up happening at some point.
2259837	2264199	And I don't know what the heck was happening.
2264199	2269482	So I feel like this game still has a lot of little bugs that need to be addressed.
2269482	2271002	And like, I get it.
2271002	2272223	It's a smaller team.
2272223	2273784	It's a Kickstarter project.
2273784	2276185	It's not like, you know, it's a different kind of thing.
2276185	2276365	But
2277185	2301056	I'm really getting annoyed this is a thing and this is the thing with games gaming in the year 2024 this is like every game now it's not unique to IUDM but it's just like this is also what I was hoping for as part of the like PlayStation 1 JRPG era is that there wouldn't be freaking patches having to address things that are broken with the game or
2301696	2308119	quality of life things they want to change later on like they did with Final Fantasy 15 or a variety of other games.
2308119	2315963	Like, I thought video game sales and success was really made or broken in the first week of sales.
2315963	2327068	I have never been more discouraged than I am now to not buy games the first week they come out because I feel like you're never going to actually play the finished product within the first week.
2327628	2335153	that you're better off waiting six months for them to do all the patches while all the real players are in there doing the testing.
2335153	2339016	And then you know, do the do the quality of life changes and things like that.
2339016	2345100	I again, I want to stress I understand this is a problem in the industry that is not unique to Aiden.
2345100	2351364	But it's just one of those things where I was just kind of sitting there going, should I have just waited six months before playing this?
2351364	2357048	I mean, what the fuck I've been waiting since like 2017 or whenever they started this Kickstarter, what would another six months have done?
2360450	2369477	And I think in a really, really weird way, I think that's what's been stopping me from playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
2369477	2373940	And I actually, from what I understand, that game actually is pretty solid and probably doesn't need patches.
2373940	2380085	But I can't help but feel in the back of my mind like, I'm going to wait a few months and make sure I'm playing the actual like finished version of that game.
2382353	2387156	Bobbie says, apparently on PC, random encounters were tied to refresh rate.
2387156	2390758	So if you had a high refresh rate, you'd never get a random encounter.
2390758	2395501	Well, I'm on PS5, but yes.
2395501	2399343	Apparently, PS5 is only rendering at 1080p, is what I heard.
2399343	2401425	It's not even playing 4K.
2401425	2404306	Just why even like tie anything to refresh rate?
2405748	2408393	Like, have we not learned since Bethesda?
2408393	2415007	Like, literally, Fallout 4, you know, locked 60 FPS because all the physics are tied to the framerate.
2417121	2423603	QuestBuster in chat says, I feel really mixed on Ayudin so far, but I'm still willing to keep pushing.
2423603	2425524	Yeah, I mean, like, don't get me wrong.
2425524	2426944	There's a lot of things I like about it.
2426944	2428664	The story's kind of interesting.
2428664	2436527	Like I got to a point where, you know, and again, I want to be very aware of spoilers, but like, the game kind of pulled a Final Fantasy VIII.
2436527	2440748	And what I mean by that is that then all of a sudden, it flipped to these other characters.
2441889	2444890	that were like out of nowhere and new.
2444890	2446071	You know, like remember Final Fantasy VIII?
2446071	2448712	I was gonna say it was pretending to be a good game.
2448712	2451113	Oh, stop.
2451113	2456835	I would say it's a good game, but there are things that hold it back from being a great game.
2456835	2462878	But I would say, you remember when you were playing like the main story of Final Fantasy VIII and then all of a sudden you were like, what's Laguna?
2462878	2463438	Was that his name?
2463438	2463758	Laguna.
2463758	2465399	Yeah, you flipped over to that.
2465399	2468820	Like there was a moment of that.
2468820	2469741	And I was like, what?
2471638	2472858	or like starting Kingdom Hearts 2
2490262	2494645	Bobby Blackwolf says they may not have been able to afford great devs who have learned those lessons already.
2494645	2498488	Yeah, that's why I'm like, I'm like, not, I'm not trying to completely shit on the game.
2498488	2502711	And I'm also recognizing this is like, this is a problem with every game.
2502711	2510636	But it's something, you know, I see every time I'm playing one of these games, when they release, I'm sitting here going, look at me, the fool again.
2511553	2513414	I should know better, but I never do.
2513414	2514634	I never learn.
2514634	2517155	QuestBuster says, Aiden's sprites are so well done.
2517155	2518856	The artist really did a good job with them.
2518856	2519136	Yeah.
2519136	2521557	And a lot of the characters are interesting too.
2521557	2528179	Some of them are very tropey anime or JRPG, but some of them are kind of like, they're really interesting.
2528179	2536522	And yeah, there's definitely some characters I like having in my party more than others because there is different dialogue, additional dialogue that changes depending on who's in your party.
2537542	2538223	It's pretty neat.
2538223	2554370	My advice to all of you that are playing through the game, though, is that when certain big things happen in the story, don't forget to go back and revisit every single town you've been to before because you never know, somebody might be there new to recruit.
2554370	2559333	And that's, but to be fair, that is exactly what happened in Suikoden.
2559333	2559613	So
2560728	2574414	you know, I think there are lots of people that wanted to back a brand new PlayStation 1 Suikoden and congratulations that that is exactly what you got for better and for worse.
2574414	2575834	All right.
2575834	2577235	I do enjoy it overall, though.
2577235	2580736	It's just these little frustrations get very frustrating.
2580736	2582137	All right.
2582137	2582237	Um,
2583484	2584985	Let's get into some other news.
2584985	2588046	I don't have anything else to really talk about during my gaming week.
2588046	2590327	I think I already mentioned on last week's show, but I'll say it again.
2590327	2594128	We will not be here Memorial Day weekend, but you got some time to worry about that.
2594128	2595689	That's still about a month away.
2595689	2605073	So let's get to some news and what is going on in the industry, starting off with what was some disappointing news for some fans this week, Loki.
2605073	2606173	Yep.
2606173	2609935	Like those single player missions in Overwatch 2,
2611240	2613863	Blizzcon is cancelled this year.
2613863	2623053	It is not going to be happening but they said that they're going to be doing something a little bit different for World of Warcraft being that
2623683	2629825	You know, of course, they're going to have some anniversaries and whatnot for the 30th anniversary of Warcraft.
2629825	2633426	So there's going to be some in-person events for that as well.
2633426	2639048	Plus, you know, of course, they have the Vessel of Hatred expansion coming out later this year as well.
2639048	2642128	So probably do something along the lines with that.
2642128	2648030	But, yeah, they just don't have anything really new to announce, I guess.
2648030	2650471	So that's why they're not doing their event.
2652526	2677325	yeah i'm i'm mixed on this you know um i'm into a lot of the blizzard stuff again like obviously there were some dark years but i'm into diablo again wow the last wow expansion was one of the better ones in a really long time um and i feel like blizzard's kind of getting their footing again that being said i'm not incredibly surprised to hear this news because and i i really don't know how else to put this for blizzcon but
2678166	2680547	The vibes just aren't right this year.
2680547	2682047	And that's that's really what it is.
2682047	2684047	The vibes are off this year.
2684047	2687988	And I think that has to do with the layoffs is a huge part of that.
2687988	2690189	That's definitely a vibe killer.
2690189	2695650	Not that Blizzard has, you know, never had layoffs before and still, but I just think something is weird about that.
2695650	2705552	That whole Microsoft cloud and the question, not the not the Internet cloud, but like the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the Microsoft merger, which ties into what I just talked about as well.
2706172	2709193	And then, you know, there's a brand new CEO, right?
2709193	2711533	They've had that transition as well.
2711533	2720296	And I think we know that Microsoft would probably encourage Blizzard to do BlizzCon because Blizzard has a strong community.
2720296	2724157	I don't see BlizzCon turning into a MicrosoftCon.
2724157	2731379	I think Microsoft is foolish to not subtly place their products under the Blizz crowd that might be
2732526	2734107	Final Fantasy XIV Fan Convention
2752040	2771554	why not show a little bit of that or some of the other things just you know again i'm not saying make it the focus of the key because i know there would be a lot of fans that would say stuff like because when they put call of duty into battle net oh did fans lose their fucking mind and i get you know i i get it because call of duty is not fucking adjacent to anything else blizzard does
2772435	2781410	But Microsoft might have some things like, dare I say something like Sea of Thieves, if they ever do another Dungeon Siege, that's pretty similar to Diablo.
2781410	2786558	You know, there are some games that are just, and I'm not, don't don't let them take up the air in the room.
2787694	2790535	but why not have them over just a little?
2790535	2797136	Here's another little row of tables you can visit that doesn't have as long of a line where we're pitching a few other things you might be into.
2797136	2802477	Like Microsoft, I think, would be foolish to not take that opportunity even if there was a BlizzCon.
2802477	2814519	Don't take up all the air of the Blizzard stuff, but have a little, you know, aside, a little, you know, food truck sponsored by Microsoft product or whatever that whole thing is, you know, going on.
2815379	2820160	So I'm a little surprised, but I'm also just like, you know what?
2820160	2824841	It does seem like the vibes are off, but I'd be very curious to see what they end up doing next year.
2824841	2843544	I have a feeling, and I'm really tinfoil hatting here, I have a feeling now that Microsoft is back in control, I think we will get an announcement maybe next year, and this will be worth having a blizzcon for, that there's going to be an Overwatch 3.
2845430	2849852	And I think, I mean, and I kind of feel like that should be obvious news, right?
2849852	2852754	You know, Overwatch, they're going to keep trying to make that happen.
2852754	2854735	Here's what I think is going to happen with Overwatch 3.
2856894	2862616	They're gonna revert a lot of shit back to Overwatch 1, is what's gonna happen in Overwatch 3.
2862616	2871079	Not everything, but I think there's gonna be some things that irritate people with Overwatch 2.
2871079	2880682	I think there is some Activision influence there, and I think some of it's gonna subtly shift back to what you liked in Overwatch 1, and Overwatch 3 will hopefully be
2881582	2882282	the game.
2882282	2889486	I know I might be I might be daydreaming a little bit, but they'll call it Overwatch 1 O.N.E.
2889486	2892427	No, just taking a page out of the Xbox One.
2892427	2895509	No, it'll be Overwatch 3, but fans will know.
2895509	2897129	There will be winks and nods.
2897129	2904773	All they have to do is say it's going back to 6v6 and fans will absolutely know what it is.
2904773	2907234	We're going back to two tanks.
2907234	2908495	They'll know.
2908495	2909015	We'll see.
2910080	2911402	Alright.
2911402	2912023	Yeah, we'll see.
2912023	2915927	I know it's a long shot, but I feel like that's the type of thing that would make- I don't know.
2915927	2923437	In this climate of the video game industry nowadays, it's like hard for me to like think, yeah, they're gonna do the right thing.
2923437	2928102	It's like, no, they're gonna do the profitable thing.
2928102	2928243	Yeah.
2929248	2950207	sj100mat says no problem having daddy microsoft pay the bill for blizzcon while showing off a few games running via game pass on some xboxes yeah sj100mat also says they got to be careful with overwatch 3 they can't mess it up out the gate like they did with 2 they can't make overwatch 1.75 fans won't stand for it oh i know and i think i think
2951189	2957911	You know, if there was any CEO out there going, gamers are stupid, they'll buy this bullshit, was Bobby Kotick.
2957911	2959671	He's no longer in the picture.
2959671	2967033	And I think that there will be a better understanding when it comes to... I mean, yeah, is it wishful thinking on my part?
2967033	2968414	Maybe a little bit.
2968414	2976256	But I just feel like if now is the time to fix what the fan issues were with that game, and I think the biggest thing they could do for Overwatch 3
2977580	2985005	I don't know how this happens with all the layoffs that just happened, but maybe if Microsoft is willing to allocate some resources, it could.
2985005	2989907	Is that Overwatch 3 is demoed with a PvE mode.
2989907	2992549	And like, here it is, it's in the game.
2992549	2993129	Done.
2993129	2995231	And by the way, we're going back to 6v6.
2995231	2998293	I think they'd get people super hyped for the game.
2998293	2998853	That was the case.
3000202	3003004	And yes, I realize Overwatch 2 does have a PvE mode.
3003004	3006747	We all know it's fucking buried under you know, it's it's a paywall.
3006747	3010730	And it's, it's not at all what we wanted it to be.
3010730	3012812	Wasn't that the EA Sports logo?
3012812	3013472	It's in the game.
3013472	3016054	It's in the game.
3016054	3018596	Yeah, yeah, it was at one point.
3018596	3019877	All right, moving on.
3021710	3029437	Let's talk about this story which is a little bit, I don't know, it's kind of a bummer but also not surprising.
3029437	3033460	And that is a comment from the ESA this week.
3033460	3037924	There was a hearing that happened recently on the topic of game preservation.
3038664	3054030	and lawyer Steve England on behalf of the Electronic Software Association, the ESA, the group that used to put on E3 until they failed at being able to do so anymore and they were mismanaged for several years, allegedly.
3054030	3061533	My perspective is that they were mismanaged for several years and they no longer are able to do E3, but they are still out there advocating
3062133	3064355	for the industry and this is how they're choosing to do it.
3064355	3070800	So lawyer Steve England was asked about online libraries being allowed to preserve vintage games.
3070800	3075003	So an online library preserving a vintage game.
3075003	3083649	Steve England replied, there's no combination of limitations ESA members would support to provide remote access.
3083649	3090675	In fact, physical building and I'm summarizing here, physical buildings, housing collections of vintage games aren't the answer either.
3092967	3100292	Online archives with few restrictions would be insufficient progress when it comes to properly preserving video game history.
3100292	3110140	But there were other speakers that made it clear something has to be done to make sure game preservation can continue no matter what the ESA members and right holders are trying to get out here.
3110140	3113142	Otherwise, gaming history could be lost forever.
3113142	3119707	We all know that, that there's all these elements of gaming history, especially as games are harder to find, disappear, go offline, da-da-da.
3120327	3134050	Kendra Albert, a technology lawyer at the same panel, said that the ESA basically has been unwilling to work with preservationists, that proposals are never enough to pacify rights holders of the games in question.
3134050	3146372	Phil Salvador, the Video Game History Foundation Library Director, argued that public libraries lack the resources or knowledge to create and curate meaningful collections of video games.
3146372	3146972	For reference,
3148058	3156320	Library of Congress once attempted to do a framework for game preservation and the ESA stopped this and stated this work is best done by publishers.
3156320	3157241	Really, ESA?
3157241	3158661	Where?
3158661	3159321	Where?
3159321	3160482	Yeah, that's it.
3160482	3161042	Was it?
3161042	3166243	Is that just like how, oh, we shouldn't be regulated in the sense of, you know, our rating system?
3166243	3168104	No, we'll we'll do that ourselves.
3168812	3179597	Is that why the Video Game History Foundation discovered that 87% of games released before 2010 are endangered and probably going to be lost?
3179597	3180698	So just I...
3182128	3188032	Yeah, the ESA, definitely not advocating for the consumer, but that's not really who they're for.
3188032	3193956	They are for the industry, but I think they're swinging the pendulum a little too hard on this.
3193956	3196718	I don't think they're doing themselves any favors.
3196718	3205825	We already know the ESA has, you know, I'm also, I'm still sitting here going, what is the ESA good for at this point?
3205825	3211148	If I'm one of these publishers, and this is what they choose to lobby?
3212156	3218722	I think there's a, I mean, and I'm sure there are some game publishers out there very happy with the ESA stance on this.
3218722	3223867	I get it from that money making dollar sign perspective.
3223867	3235717	But at the same time, like if a game is not available through any legal means, I'm sorry, it is ethically okay to pirate that game at that point.
3235717	3238099	Because if, if you're not selling it,
3239116	3243399	How am I supposed to be able to get this, you know, experience this game?
3243399	3251565	Even if that could be for research, for studying for future game development, for all these types of purposes beyond just playing it for fun.
3251565	3255528	These games should be accessible as things to learn from.
3255528	3258931	I wouldn't even say necessarily it being accessible publicly.
3258931	3263575	I would say is if my pirating a game
3264864	3265465	Thank you
3290558	3292239	It's not hurting anything.
3292239	3296881	It's not like they're selling that game on the Switch Store or something like that.
3296881	3298162	And that's the thing.
3298162	3304226	I feel a lot of times they try to push this argument with a lot of things that they're losing money.
3304226	3311110	First off, don't care if you're losing money because you're making billions of dollars doing all sorts of predatory sales stuff anyways.
3311110	3313611	But they've tried to make that argument with used games.
3313611	3316073	They've tried to make that argument with rentals.
3316073	3317614	They've tried to make that argument with
3318607	3342661	So many things and like frankly it doesn't seem to really matter because it to them it's just we're just not making enough money because our shareholders are pressuring us to make more money for them and it's never going to be feasible so they try to like pick up whatever pennies they can in this case if they're stopping video game preservation so they can get you to buy the sequel or get you to buy the re-release or the remaster or whatever the case may be.
3346087	3346647	Boy, oh boy.
3346647	3359189	Again, I'm looking at the ESA website right now, by the way, and on the ESA website, I was curious, like, well, what things have this, and y'all know I've made this point before, in their own words, what things have the ESA done recently for the industry?
3359189	3363170	And there are two articles from the entire year 2024 so far.
3363170	3365090	There are two articles.
3365090	3365670	Let's hear.
3365670	3367151	One of them is a report, U.S.
3367151	3369411	consumer video game spending totaled $57.2 billion in 2023.
3369411	3370171	They didn't do that.
3370171	3370591	That's an article.
3375634	3379560	The following statement on the nomination of Deborah Robinson to service the U.S.
3379560	3382725	Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator.
3382725	3383727	Oh, thanks.
3383727	3385009	That's interesting.
3386656	3387957	and it gets into the top grossing games.
3387957	3391839	Again, I'm not sure what the ESA had to do with any of this, but OK.
3391839	3404908	And then there's this from January, the Entertainment Software Association statement of support for the appointment of Sharon Israel, who is the now the chief policy officer and director for international affairs at the U.S.
3404908	3407089	Patent and Trademark Office.
3407089	3411272	Oh, thank God there's someone at the Patent Office to think about those video games.
3411272	3415315	I was worried there for a second that we might not have, you know, even more
3416212	3419595	Patent exploitation by corporations.
3419595	3424100	Those are the two things that the ESA has done this year in their own words.
3425819	3426980	So they haven't done anything.
3426980	3429902	That's like LinkedIn news articles that they put out.
3429902	3431843	Like, come on, like it's it's garbage.
3431843	3434225	It's garbage.
3434225	3434845	Let's see.
3434845	3445192	SSU 100 Matt in chat says ESA is wearing Zubaz pants, drinking new Coke, giving us the thumbs up while we buy Super Mario Brothers 3 for the 15th time on a new system.
3445192	3445912	You know what?
3445912	3447974	At least Super Mario Brothers 3 is available.
3447974	3449955	I'll I'll say that much.
3449955	3452157	And Bobby Blackwolf says arcade archives.
3452157	3452857	Yes.
3452857	3455159	A great example of arcade preservation.
3455159	3455379	Yes.
3456520	3459104	Hats off to SNK.
3459104	3462708	That Neo Geo stuff is preserved.
3462708	3466954	If Gauntlet Legends ever came out on Archaic Archives, day one.
3466954	3467515	Absolutely.
3468638	3475760	Well, some folks are pointing out, well, I think there's certain illegal means to get it, but there's also the Dreamcast version.
3475760	3477661	I mean, hello, hello.
3477661	3478842	Look at who you're talking to here.
3478842	3483883	Like, I know, like, I'm 100% aware of what I need to do.
3483883	3485784	But like, I'm just saying, like, to be educated.
3485784	3486364	Okay.
3486364	3487505	I do not need to be educated.
3487505	3488585	No, I'm just saying that, like,
3489938	3495105	You know, like, even going back to Steam, like, I'd rather purchase it through legal means.
3495105	3501013	It's just, you know, give me those legal means to do that, like, for sure.
3501013	3501774	All right.
3501774	3507001	Bobby Blackwell says we must chat-splain this to Loki.
3507001	3507242	Yes.
3509520	3510601	Go ahead.
3510601	3515846	I love- You're telling me there's software free on the internet and I don't have to pay for it?
3515846	3526236	You know, this is one of the few video game podcasts, not the only, but we're one of the few video game podcasts out there that can, where the host can be chat-splained to by their listeners.
3526236	3527517	I actually kind of enjoy it though.
3527517	3528999	Sometimes they're right.
3528999	3530400	Not always, but sometimes they're right.
3531769	3549035	I mean, honestly, like, there is an area, like, for sure, there is an area, and I think Gauntlet Legends, for me, is kind of that, like, barrier, like, newer, modern arcade games, like, that is a little beyond my understanding right now of how to play on my computer type of thing.
3549035	3555217	You know, like, some of those that run on PC, like, actual PC hardware in the arcades, you know, more, like,
3555777	3557598	DarkSakura has something that's in a similar type of vein.
3577955	3579977	It is.
3579977	3591105	There basically has appeared this yellow Nintendo cartridge that was labeled NOACOPY-22387.
3591105	3598170	And what this is, is a prototype version of The Legend of Zelda, the US release.
3598951	3605914	So it's got a little bit, I think, related back to the Famicom Disk version.
3605914	3608875	And, you know, I played it.
3608875	3612577	At least I got through, like, the first level of it and didn't really see any differences.
3612577	3626043	But comparing the code side by side visually, there looks like there are some differences, at least back end.
3626043	3627484	I'm sorry, I don't read binary.
3629810	3641658	But one thing that they found, and for the record he put up the whole image up there, it's like you can contain the whole thing in one image and someone re-dumped it back to the ROM.
3645231	3657460	One bug that was observed in that is that when you exit a cave, Link remains under the ground for the last position of one frame before teleporting to the entrance.
3657460	3658220	I looked.
3658220	3659801	I mean, I think I was tired.
3659801	3661483	I didn't notice.
3661483	3663024	But, I mean, overall...
3664324	3668065	It was exactly the Legend of Zelda that I remembered playing.
3668065	3675347	So if they find more differences out there, then I would really like to see what they end up being.
3675347	3678568	I'm actually following this guy on Twitter.
3678568	3682370	It's Mr. Talida.
3682370	3688471	As a point, I'm trying not to spend any time on Twitter, but I don't know where else I can find this guy.
3688471	3693173	So I want to see if there are any other differences that come up from this.
3694502	3697888	Yeah, I love these prototype cartridges getting found and all this.
3697888	3701093	I think this is some of the most interesting stuff that's out there.
3701093	3703136	So yeah, I love to see the
3704926	3705326	Prototype
3728494	3731236	Yeah, it's really neat.
3731236	3736741	And I'll be honest, you know, it was kind of like, oh, yeah, Zelda.
3736741	3741885	And I was just sort of, you know, muscle-memorying my way through the game.
3741885	3744607	It was fun.
3744607	3749611	Just as easy the first time as I remember, you know, at least through the first level.
3749611	3751332	I had a great time.
3751332	3754435	It was a good incentive for me to touch the classic.
3755748	3762112	All right, well, let's move on and talk about that part of Nintendo that Loki loves to talk about, the legal department.
3762112	3765694	It's litigious news with Nintendo.
3765694	3771137	Yeah, so this week, you know, when they're not striking down, what was it last week?
3771137	3772938	I don't remember now.
3772938	3773358	Well, let's see.
3773358	3776560	They've gone after go-karting companies.
3776560	3777660	They've gone after
3778961	3780302	fan games.
3780302	3796206	This now is 3D model content that's been put into Garry's Mod by people, you know, because there's lots of user-generated content in Garry's Mod and people use that to do all sorts of crazy things, including make animations and whatnot.
3796206	3805469	But yes, Facepunch Studios has received a takedown notice to remove 20 years worth of Nintendo-related content from the game.
3806789	3815335	They updated their Steam page with saying, Some of you may have noticed certain Nintendo-related workshop items have recently been taken down.
3815335	3816716	This is not a mistake.
3816716	3818858	The takedowns came from Nintendo.
3818858	3820359	Honestly, this is fair enough.
3820359	3825162	This is Nintendo's content, and what they allow and don't allow is up to them.
3825162	3828284	They don't want you playing with that stuff in Gary's mod.
3828284	3829265	That's their decision.
3829265	3833088	We have to respect that and take down as much as we can.
3833088	3834809	And then they followed that up with,
3835259	3841184	If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo-related uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot.
3841184	3845208	Because I'm sure they don't want to be sued by Nintendo.
3845208	3848831	Which, to be fair, it's not really their... I mean, it's the users doing it.
3848831	3853015	It's not, you know, Facepunch Studios and say, hey, upload all your Nintendo content to us.
3853015	3857439	I mean, I'm sure that they have, like, clauses for, like, copyrighted works, but...
3859031	3860352	I don't know.
3860352	3861313	Now I'm off the roadblocks.
3861313	3865156	It's just interesting to me, like how old or how long this has been around.
3865156	3868298	And again, it's one of those things is just now coming to light.
3868298	3885192	But again, if you if you kind of believe what was said by that, you remember the the former head of legal Nintendo was interviewed by some blog or podcast or something a few weeks ago and actually said, like, when these things show up on my desk is when we kind of learn about them, you know, or that or how things were run at the time.
3885192	3886773	Maybe that person was at the Pokemon company.
3886773	3887174	I don't remember.
3888174	3896099	Yeah, but still, like, you know, you sort of get that sense that, wow, somebody, somebody, somebody narked on this stuff to Nintendo.
3896099	3898581	And now the, you know, cease and desist went out.
3898581	3900642	You know, people didn't even believe it was real at first.
3900642	3903564	They thought somebody was actually impersonating Nintendo.
3903564	3904164	That was the first.
3904164	3907887	That's why that comment actually says it is real.
3907887	3913590	It's from Nintendo because they had to sort of verify that it actually was from Nintendo.
3913590	3914591	So, yeah.
3915351	3925180	Um, here, look, I don't mean to dig up months old drama, but at the same time, sometimes I'm a little bit messy and I live for drama.
3925180	3929724	It is interesting to me because we're talking about models of Nintendo characters, right?
3929724	3935569	That are like in Gary's mod or think that models that are out to resemble Nintendo characters, right?
3935569	3935809	Yes.
3936448	3941056	Okay, how is POW World still operating?
3941056	3943640	Like, let's be real.
3943640	3949690	How did fucking Garry's Mod get the C&D before POW World?
3950660	3956104	Well, I think it's a sense that it's their IP that people are creating models of.
3956104	3956825	It would be different.
3956825	3959927	It would be like, well, I don't think we could draw the same comparison.
3959927	3964070	It's like, say Palworld made a really terrible version of Pikachu.
3964070	3968493	Like they just, they tried to really make Pikachu, but they're just not really good at modeling.
3968493	3971055	And so it didn't quite look like Pikachu.
3971055	3974337	But in Palworld, it does look like Pikachu.
3974337	3976319	Well, not, not that in Pokemon specifically.
3976699	3977299	Steve Lovett
3999634	4006657	And it's, you know, again, I'm not anti pal world or anything before people, you know, I played the game for a hot minute.
4006657	4009698	And I was like, All right, this is this isn't Pokemon.
4009698	4010178	That was my thing.
4010178	4012559	I was like, this is not Pokemon for adults.
4012559	4017600	And the video games, media bloggers blew that way the fuck out of control.
4017600	4021082	This is this is arc survival evolved with Pokemon in it.
4021082	4022582	That's what that game was.
4022582	4027604	But I, I'd like even I look at it and I go look,
4029196	4036223	These creatures in POW World are legally distinct Pokemon, and I'm not even sure they're legally distinct, to be quite honest.
4036223	4040126	They do look very much like... I traced that.
4040126	4044310	Like, it's... I don't know.
4044310	4044631	I don't know.
4046020	4054465	MusicalDaredevil in our chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, thank you very much for the raid by the way, says, I also heard a lot of comparisons to Ark.
4054465	4065791	Yeah, it's, unfortunately that game ended up with headlines, it was like, oh yeah, it's Pokemon with guns, or it's Pokemon for adults, and it's like, neither of those things are true.
4065791	4074696	Pokemon is a turn-based battle game, it's a RPG mechanic rooted, that literally doesn't exist in PAL world.
4075475	4076455	not there.
4076455	4078076	It is a survival game.
4078076	4095663	It is a you know, and the the little pals, the legally distinct Pokemon question mark in that game simply they do tasks for you and you do collect them that is part of that in your interface that looks very similar to Zelda Breath of the Wild.
4095663	4103006	But somehow lays like it's almost like we're going to copy this from this game and copy this from this game.
4103006	4104407	Yeah.
4104407	4104647	Anyway,
4106139	4111283	Can we get like a 3D platforming POW World game then?
4111283	4126973	Careful what you, I just, again, if Nintendo lets it go by, there is going to be a POW World spinoff game that's an RPG, and then it's going to be too late, like, to stop that game from getting, because once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.
4126973	4128133	All right.
4128133	4131316	Well, one thing I would like to see on the internet is a fully
4132216	4137059	playable game on release day.
4137059	4140440	But Aiden Chronicle, we talked a little bit about that earlier in the game.
4140440	4144583	It's been having some problems and it was released on the switch.
4144583	4147424	And it was a little rough when it came out.
4147424	4154628	There apparently well apparently the devs originally were saying we're not even sure we can put this on the switch, but they did pull it off.
4154628	4159591	But there were some glitches and bugs and those sorts of things including
4160471	4188311	a patch that just came out for the game that's right a day one patch version 1.0.3 that addresses progression issues because i believe there was a character and this was on all versions actually there was a character where you couldn't uh actually recruit them if they weren't in your party at a certain time it was weird um graphic display glitches game balance adjustments refinement of localized text updated backer content game system bug fixes
4189111	4196194	Overall optimizations, improved stability, and then there is a upcoming 1.04 patch that's coming.
4196194	4205738	Oh, this is the Lamb is the name of the ally that has somebody recruitable later in the story that apparently blocks a certain part of the game.
4205738	4210340	It's just basically a series of events goes a certain way, and it's irrecoverable.
4210340	4211720	Luckily, it's late in the game.
4211720	4214782	I definitely have no idea who that character is, and I'm about 12 hours in, but
4215862	4218204	still one of those things is just kind of annoying.
4218204	4221165	You know, I'm glad to see the patches are happening.
4221165	4226369	But again, should I just I just wait six months to play so I know I'm playing like, okay, they're really good.
4226369	4229010	Yeah, you can play turbo kit turbo kit instead.
4229010	4230451	Yeah, that game is awesome.
4230451	4233373	I honestly I'm gonna endorse that game.
4233373	4234534	I'm not paid by them.
4234534	4236275	Like I'm gonna endorse it because that game is awesome.
4236275	4238316	Like seriously, go play that game.
4238316	4240278	It's super cheap to like sub $20.
4241492	4244136	Dr. T in chat says I heard Shane had some issues with it.
4244136	4245257	So this one was for him.
4245257	4247840	Yeah, he was experiencing some of those issues.
4247840	4251284	But as far as I know, I mean, he can call in if he really wants to have a say.
4251284	4252105	I don't know if he's listening.
4252105	4255950	But as far as I know, he's he's relatively happy with the game.
4255950	4258973	But he in that camp of
4260137	4263960	I want another Suikoden on PlayStation 1.
4263960	4265541	He got what he asked for.
4265541	4268924	Like it's again for better and for worse.
4268924	4273708	So but if you're really a hardcore fan, that stuff ain't gonna bother you.
4273708	4276030	So fine.
4276030	4278112	All right.
4278112	4282635	Moving on and but I know he does have it on at least two different systems.
4282635	4286779	Just to be clear, because I think he backed it on PlayStation 5.
4286779	4289441	But he is playing it on Nintendo Switch.
4289441	4289541	So
4290609	4292411	Alright, let's move on.
4292411	4295474	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4295474	4310931	Well, for fans of Mega Man Legends, the second game's Japanese prologue is finally getting translated into English by a fan translation group called Hilltop Works, and they are working on this.
4314250	4317652	It's going to be interesting.
4317652	4329760	And if you are big fans of this series, of course, you might know of its Japanese name, Rockman Dash 2, Episode 2, Oninaru Isan.
4329760	4338266	But the English name for the version would be Mega Man Legends 2, Episode 1, Roll's Close Call.
4338266	4341268	And they are saying that it actually should already be live.
4343049	4351996	You can find that on Hilltop's, looks like their social media.
4351996	4354478	All right.
4354478	4369251	That's kind of, I'm surprised it kind of took this long for a fan translation, honestly, especially with how many fans there are of the Mega Man Legends series and how we're all sitting here feeling some sort of way that they never did do Mega Man Legend 3.
4369251	4370212	But, you know,
4370692	4373555	That's that's still really cool for fans of the series.
4373555	4382705	I love to see the the this kind of is along the lines of the prototype stuff where it's like, oh, this little secret from years ago gets unearthed.
4382705	4385648	But in this case, the secret is, oh, it's a part of the game.
4385648	4387490	They just didn't even bring over in the U.S.
4387490	4391254	version, like like the endings with Buster Groove, right?
4391254	4391995	We're kind of like that.
4393476	4393957	Bust a Move
4407389	4411071	Nope, I'm not rediscovering it because they broke it.
4411071	4412392	Of course.
4412392	4433423	Um, yeah, so Fallout 4, I was getting their next gen update for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and then of course PC, I play on PC and it broke the PC version, at least if you're modding it, because, um, the mod loaders and stuff for it don't work with this version of the game.
4433423	4433563	Um,
4434867	4439712	The actual update itself is kind of minimal.
4439712	4446718	They've only patched 16 bugs in the game and updated some of the stability in it.
4446718	4452844	Also, there's the Xbox Series X and S quality mode, which you get a
4454369	4454449	and
4465999	4477285	Also, there was an issue with folks that had gotten the game through PlayStation Plus that you weren't able to download this update.
4477285	4482108	It wasn't working, so they're working on fixing that as well.
4482108	4488152	However, though, the good news is the folks behind the script extender, Ian Pat,
4488832	4491034	said that they are working on an update.
4491034	4494617	Unfortunately, they don't know how long it's going to take to create it.
4494617	4495998	They said, I'm working on an update.
4495998	4503723	I can't currently offer a timeline for its availability, nor whether there will be any critical technical issues that would block an update.
4503723	4508207	If not obvious already, this one's going to take much longer than normal.
4508207	4511810	Thanks, Bethesda, for breaking things.
4511810	4517354	I haven't heard yet what the new, like, there's supposed to be like a new questline stuff that's available in there as well, but
4519187	4523277	I dunno, I'd rather not have that and be able to play the game modded.
4524083	4533368	QuestBuster in our chat says, Fallout London, a huge and ambitious mod, was forced to delay their release because of the patch and are apparently not happy about it.
4533368	4537931	SJ100Matt says, just wait for the modders to fix Fallout 4 better than Bethesda will.
4537931	4538892	They already did.
4538892	4552599	Like, that's the thing, is Bethesda came in to try to fix it, like, for console players, I guess, to patch it, bring it up to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Specs, but, like, they can't be trusted to make a good game anymore.
4552599	4553420	It's just...
4555274	4560316	After Starfield, man, like I just don't trust them with any other games anymore.
4560316	4570119	Well, you know, after the TV show and everything, which has been received really well, apparently the number of concurrent users playing Fallout 4 like really took off.
4570119	4573640	Like there are a lot of people going back to the game because of the series.
4573640	4574241	Yeah.
4574241	4578682	Which is not surprising, but maybe the volume is a little surprising.
4578682	4578902	Yeah.
4578902	4580623	And there is a way to like
4581748	4608975	um basically unpatch the game to back to before this patch it's just a pain in the ass and i don't want to do it you just you just want a game that works is that so wrong i just want a game that works the way i want it i want it to break when i put too many mods into it like i don't want to break because bethesda's touched something on it like fifth dream does point out mods not in creation club are not officially supported so the game still works
4610066	4611027	I don't care.
4626238	4631820	because when you break all the mods, it's like, well, that was that was the game I enjoy, you know?
4631820	4633220	And, you know, I could see that.
4633220	4636961	Well, Blizzard, excuse me, not Blizzard, Bethesda doesn't have to support that stuff.
4636961	4643543	But it's also like but the fact that you can mod it so extensively is what makes the game appealing to buy for many people.
4643543	4648925	Like I know last week on the show, Loki, you were showing off the Silent Hill mod in the background, which even I thought was pretty cool.
4648925	4653946	And I'm not a big Fallout person, but I was like, oh, reskinning Silent Hill might be an interesting experience, right?
4654727	4657328	Yeah, I mean, so, I mean, I get it.
4657328	4661070	I get that they, the Creation Club is great for bringing mods to console.
4661070	4664671	I mean, that's, that's, I, you know, commend them for that.
4664671	4667592	However, they weren't doing it out of the kindness of their heart.
4667592	4669513	They were doing it to sell mods to people.
4669513	4677356	So, like, at the same time, like, you know, I don't really applaud them for that.
4677356	4679857	On top of that, like, once again, Starfield.
4679857	4680718	Let's look at Starfield.
4680718	4683539	Like, they have had so much time to
4685100	4712175	build a great game, and they're like, nah, we're gonna use our super old engine and still try to tack even more garbage onto it, and I'm sure that'll work, and it just, it completely was broken, and yeah, yeah, the modders will fix it, but once again, this is a game that they charged $70 for, and then some, and they want modders to fix their mistakes?
4712175	4713176	You fix your mistakes.
4714093	4716434	Fortnite Festival just started season 3!
4738001	4739342	Billy Eilish?
4739342	4741923	Yeah, one of the rumored leaked things.
4741923	4745825	William Eilash has actually landed.
4745825	4747646	Season three has started.
4747646	4749567	And so that's something available to you.
4749567	4751989	And there's some songs that go with it as well.
4751989	4754190	But guess what?
4754190	4759513	Some of the plastic rock band stuff is now available as well.
4759513	4760974	That's right.
4760974	4764536	Fortnite Festival now supports rock band 4 controllers.
4765436	4768097	on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.
4768097	4776679	So if you have a Rock Band 4 plastic guitar, you can use it to play pro lead and pro bass tracks for any jam track.
4776679	4783360	And by the way, it actually also changes the lanes to have the colored notes like it had in Rock Band.
4783360	4788341	That is a neat little quality of life thing that I don't think was teased originally.
4788341	4794383	Also, hammer-on and pull-off notes, just like you saw in the original Rock Band and Guitar Hero, are also
4795123	4803728	available that is so they really they really went out of their way to make this game Rock Band 5 which I think is very interesting.
4803728	4811312	So um, I believe those third party controllers are showing up as well because I want to say somebody I knew got one, which is interesting.
4812290	4822338	Um, by the way, on a weird related note about Fortnite, Epic added a setting that allows players to hide certain emotes that people use for trolling.
4822338	4835128	So sometimes when people get eliminated, a player could then do an emote that's like take the loss, which is like doing the L on the forehead, like LOL, you know, loser or whatever, LOL, and does a little dance when they do it.
4835128	4838511	Now, if you have that setting, you won't see it.
4839557	4839877	Ragequit
4861224	4863466	Fifth Dream says, do they charge for songs?
4863466	4864347	Yes, they do.
4864347	4866288	And it is not cheap, unfortunately.
4866288	4870851	But what they do is they have a rotating library of free songs.
4870851	4873613	And at four o'clock Pacific, I think is still the time.
4873613	4882800	I don't know if that changed to five with the time zone change, but it it rotates every day Fifth Dream, the selection of free tracks.
4882800	4888845	So if you kind of visit once a day, you have 10 or so tracks that you can pick from.
4890865	4893829	Alright, moving on.
4893829	4899438	Let's get to a segment from a time from before even rock band.
4899438	4899979	Let's roll the bumper.
4910699	4918466	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4918466	4922089	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4922089	4926092	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game this week?
4926092	4928775	I picked Scud Race.
4928775	4930396	Ever hear of it?
4930396	4932137	Uh, I think so, actually.
4933459	4939684	So, Scud Race is an arcade racing game done by Sega, was released in 1996.
4939684	4944828	And for the record, I think I heard about it from you.
4944828	4945028	Okay.
4949401	4951723	I lost my train of thought.
4951723	4963734	It's the first racing game that was released on the Sega Model 3 hardware and it never did come out on Saturn.
4963734	4971821	There was a Dreamcast port announced and there was a tech demo for it on Dreamcast but it didn't come out which is sad face.
4975499	4979942	Scud Race had two arcade cabinets.
4979942	4985505	One was the twin or the deluxe cabinet that you could link up for up to eight players.
4985505	4995311	It was modeled after the BPR Global GT series that featured four different cards that were used in the 1996 season.
4998490	5014446	It had different courses of different difficulty, from beginner, with a daytime and nighttime, all the way up through an expert one, and you could put the game into Grand Prix or Endurance mode for longer races.
5018727	5027929	And there's also a thought that the demo of this that came out on Dreamcast turned into the Sega GT series.
5027929	5043373	So, um, the, uh, four Scud Race tracks are actually unlockable on the Xbox version of OutRun 2, uh, rearranged as a whole OutRun route instead of just the individual laps.
5043373	5047894	Um, so, uh, at any rate, um,
5051095	5060818	The opponent's cars, though, except for the ones that you can select on the main screen, are all Renault Alpine GTA A610s.
5060818	5069941	And so, moving into a little bit of the development, they really wanted an Etona sequel.
5069941	5076603	The director, Nagoshi Toshihiro, he was like, he had the same team,
5077880	5087386	They thought they were working on the Daytona sequel, but it ended up having a different look and went in a different direction.
5087386	5098033	They had an arcade test game called Supercar, and that turned into Scud Race, aka Super GT, as we had it in the U.S.
5098033	5104397	Notable similarities is that, you know, they all had, like, similar HUD, and
5105629	5119474	the way that it handled in general, but that there was a drifting acceleration added in, so your drifting was a little bit different in the game.
5119474	5130598	And Yu Suzuki, who we know as the head of AM2, also had advice to give, so he's contributed to the game a little bit too, and the cabinet design was a Sega AM4.
5135465	5145833	So they originally planned for this to be the first Model 3 game, but Virtua Fighter 3 came out before it.
5145833	5149575	But this was the first racing game put out on there.
5149575	5159262	And to make sure that they had the cars accurately done in game, the development team got to race the four cars that were used in the game.
5162598	5172483	So this was debuted on January 21st, 1987 at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London.
5172483	5179026	And then they actually did unveil Daytona USA 2.
5179026	5181928	So that was the true sequel, of course, to Daytona.
5184550	5194859	So, Scud Race had its location test in Irvine, Irvine, California at the Sega City Arcade in 1987 before it had a rest of the American release.
5194859	5199143	As I said, it was released as Super GT in North America because the word Scud
5200204	5209847	I actually had people thinking of the Scud missiles used in the Gulf War.
5209847	5215108	There was a Scud Race Plus.
5215108	5219650	The version would allow you to play any of the four courses in reverse.
5220330	5226616	And it had a super beginner mode that had an oval track inside a giant play room, playhouse.
5226616	5230079	You could be a rocking horse and bowling pin.
5230079	5234403	Well, you could hit bowling pins.
5234403	5237947	And you could also I think you could play as a cat.
5237947	5240649	Yeah, you can race as a cat, a tank.
5240649	5241210	Hell yes.
5242304	5247068	The AM2 crew, apparently the cat didn't have the drift mechanic or something.
5247068	5249309	I, I remembered watching something about it.
5249309	5251071	Or you could be a rocket car.
5251071	5259117	Um, there's an attract mode there where there's a red sports car going through an Italian village and destroys the Coliseum.
5259117	5266782	Um, the, uh, background is a giant, uh, wheel that is blue, uh, instead of yellow orange.
5266782	5269564	Um, and of course there was no American release of Scud Race Plus.
5270625	5280670	They never marketed this version outside of Japan, but there is a switch to switch it to USA, and the title turns to SEGA Super GT Plus.
5280670	5284492	It has basically everything from Scud Race Plus.
5284492	5292515	I'm trying to remember what the cars... I don't see it listing what the cars, but I know that one of them is a Porsche 911.
5292515	5293996	Let me double check real quick.
5293996	5295957	Cars in Scud Race.
5295957	5296377	Okay.
5296377	5298198	It was in this YouTube clip somewhere, too.
5299178	5302601	Yeah, but I figured I'd say them anyway.
5302601	5302821	Okay.
5302821	5305884	So yeah, I was right about the Porsche 911 GT2.
5305884	5311628	There was a McLaren F1 GTR, which by the way, I've gotten to drive one, just saying.
5311628	5319935	A Ferrari F40 GTE and a Chrysler Viper GTS-R.
5319935	5328222	The unplayable vehicles was the Alpine A610 and the 87 Lamborghini Countach.
5329383	5341206	So your, uh, your areas that you could play was, uh, for a beginner, you had, uh, Salinas in Monterey, California.
5341206	5342507	Uh, the Dolphin Tunnel.
5342507	5346828	You had Niagara Falls, Ontario for a medium.
5346828	5351409	You had, uh, Narita International Airport for, uh, Japan.
5351409	5353810	And that actually was a beginner and, uh,
5355458	5356038	Midna, knock it off!
5387580	5391664	It was rated by Game Machine as the second most successful dedicated arcade game of the month for March 1st, 1997.
5391664	5392644	Very positive reviews.
5412021	5416264	It, a few places, gave it like 4 out of 5 and 5 out of 5.
5416264	5419026	You know, very, very high ranked.
5419026	5423309	And, um, I'd like to read this quote by Next Generation.
5423309	5428753	Um, Sega's newest Model 3 creation is the most gorgeous driving game ever to grace an arcade.
5428753	5437840	Simply put, Sega's Super GT is a visual masterpiece boasting never-before-seen graphics and providing realistic driving speeds gamers simply have never experienced.
5437840	5439581	Unless, of course, they're Mario and Ready.
5441994	5442634	And that's it.
5442634	5443435	Love it.
5443435	5443655	All right.
5443655	5444535	Good race.
5444535	5445095	There it is.
5445095	5446476	Scud Race, Classic Game of the Week.
5446476	5450837	But over here, it was called Super GT Race.
5450837	5454558	I think maybe that's how I learned about it.
5454558	5455439	That's how I learned about it.
5455439	5456859	I probably called it that name.
5456859	5458620	And Jamie was like, Oh, you mean this?
5458620	5461581	You mean Scud Race?
5461581	5462141	I don't know.
5462141	5467423	I mean, I have seen a Scud Race in the wild, but
5469631	5473953	It was so long ago.
5473953	5474754	God, I want to see.
5474754	5478015	I feel like one of the golf lands had it, I swear.
5478015	5479236	I take that back.
5479236	5485039	We had one at, there was one at Tilt, I think, in Dothan, Alabama.
5485039	5489962	And they had to order the GT kit for it or something.
5489962	5493683	Like they got it through some way.
5493683	5494464	Interesting.
5494464	5494704	All right.
5495612	5502728	Well, let's travel around and check out some other news pretty quickly on what is happening in the industry in a segment called Rapid Fire News.
5502728	5503290	We'll go to Loki.
5504429	5506911	We were talking about game preservation.
5506911	5512275	Well, Capcom is taking down three titles from the Steam Marketplace.
5512275	5515618	Dark Void, Dark Void Zero, and Flock.
5515618	5517339	And they didn't give a reason why.
5517339	5526286	They're just discontinuing sales of these titles May 8th at 5.30pm Pacific Daylight Time.
5526286	5531330	Customers who purchased the title prior to the delisting date may still be able to enjoy these games in the future.
5531810	5537751	depending on their PC's operating system's ability to continue to run these games.
5537751	5539652	Cool, thanks.
5539652	5541272	Game preservation is important.
5541272	5542452	Yep.
5542452	5557275	Also important and a thing that made me upset is that, you know, we never did get Grand Theft Auto V single-player DLC, like expansions, because the Grand Theft Auto IV expansions were fantastic, and I really wish that there was more of that.
5557275	5559736	Well, apparently there was actually supposed to be
5560356	5562578	single player expansions.
5562578	5567203	We know this based off of comments made by the voice actors.
5567203	5576413	Steven Og, who did the voice and motion capture for Trevor on a recent podcast with Streamily.
5576413	5583500	Basically, we're talking about some of the unreleased DLC for Grand Theft Auto V. One of those would have been
5584360	5608108	Agent Trevor, which had his character Trevor Phillips playing an undercover officer working for the Feds and kind of doing some sort of like, you know, James Bond-ish type stuff along with that because Trevor Phillips is kind of a, you know, insane, drug-addicted, crazy person in the game.
5608108	5611729	So it was quite a fish out of water scenario that
5616315	5617515	Okay, something weird has happened.
5617515	5618636	I've lost Loki.
5618636	5620216	Jamie, do I still have you?
5620216	5620456	Okay.
5620456	5621136	Yeah.
5621136	5623077	Okay, we had a weird hiccup there on discord.
5623077	5624637	So Loki, thank you discord.
5624637	5625677	Yeah, sorry.
5625677	5627518	I still heard Loki the whole time.
5627518	5629198	Okay, then it was probably a hiccup on my end.
5629198	5630518	But yeah, weird.
5630518	5636100	I don't usually that's like the first internet glitch we've had since like a year or so.
5636100	5637680	Sorry, Loki, you just froze there at the end.
5638638	5640679	Okay, let's see.
5640679	5655785	So anyways, they were planning on having DLC for all of the three games protagonists, but you know, Grand Theft Auto 9 was a thing and they made so much money that they're like, money, and they forget it.
5655785	5657125	Interesting.
5657125	5660747	All right, let's move on and DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5662387	5671475	Well, there is some DLC coming out for River City Girls 2, and it is River City Girls 2 Cross Double Dragon.
5671475	5678901	So you will get Billy and Jimmy Lee in the game, and they're going to go around and kick some ass.
5678901	5680923	And there's voice acting.
5680923	5681884	Oh, cool.
5681884	5682104	Nice.
5684670	5686391	Nintendo Switch Online Service
5704938	5707319	and Iggy's Wrecking Balls.
5707319	5709039	Yes, those are the games.
5709039	5719461	And I vaguely remember Xtreme G. I think I did see because I remember it looks like Tron Bikes, like it's what they're not, except they look like actual motorcycles, but they're kind of shaped like Tron Bikes.
5719461	5720782	So there's that.
5720782	5722022	It's basically a motorcycle racing game.
5722022	5724143	But then Iggy's Wrecking Balls.
5724143	5729484	I literally have never heard of this game, which looks like maybe like a monkey ball kind of game for Nintendo 64.
5730543	5735569	travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out in a store near you.
5735569	5736491	We'll start with the US, Loki.
5748004	5749305	Not a lot this week.
5749305	5758249	We've got Braid Anniversary Edition on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, iOS, and Android.
5758249	5761370	Sea of Thieves on PlayStation 5.
5761370	5764991	Endless Ocean, Luminous on Nintendo Switch.
5764991	5769313	I guess that's... I forgot that was a thing coming out.
5769313	5777217	And then we have Toho, Mystica's... Izakaya on Nintendo Switch.
5779102	5780884	Izakaya?
5780884	5782166	Maybe Izakaya.
5782166	5782907	Who knows?
5782907	5788154	That's like a like going to get drinks and snacks after work kind of place.
5788154	5791698	Well, it is a restaurant simulation, so... There you go.
5791698	5791979	There you go.
5792805	5793485	That's it.
5793485	5801370	Well, going to Japanese releases, here's the thing is that, you know, there's that one week a year where I go, huh, it seems like there's nothing coming out in Japan.
5801370	5802110	Is it Golden Week?
5802110	5803471	And the answer is yes.
5803471	5804471	Guess what?
5804471	5805071	It's Golden Week.
5805071	5805792	It's Golden Week!
5805792	5810074	And that probably explains Happy Golden Week to anyone in Japan who's listening.
5810074	5812835	But that explains probably why it's a little slower.
5812835	5814176	However, it's actually not empty.
5814176	5815657	The calendar in Japan is not empty.
5815657	5819259	I think because we have more worldwide releases now, and especially with digital,
5819779	5825081	So that same Izakaya game you were just talking about is releasing in Japan as well on May 2nd.
5825081	5826121	However, guess what?
5826121	5829182	There's a regular and a limited edition.
5829182	5831063	Because of course there are.
5831063	5835564	It looks like you get some little cards in the limited edition, some stickers maybe.
5835564	5837805	It looks like, let's, can I be completely right?
5837805	5841986	It looks like a bunch of crap, but that's usually what comes with the limited edition is a bunch of crap.
5842526	5842826	DarkSakura UK
5867762	5870803	For the UK, just a handful.
5870803	5875165	On May 2nd, we have MotoGP 24th for the big three.
5875165	5879547	On Switch, we have Endless Ocean Luminous.
5879547	5886810	Also on the third on PlayStation and Switch, we have Mike Magnolia's Hellboy Web of Weird.
5886810	5891292	For PlayStation, Xbox, and computer, we have House Flipper 2.
5893888	5895609	All right.
5895609	5897510	Well, that's it for the release dates.
5897510	5899192	Let's do just a couple more stories.
5899192	5902334	And then we'll see if any of you want to participate with the roundtable.
5902334	5906316	We always accept your emails participate at orange on trader.com.
5906316	5914141	We'll check out and see if anybody wants to call as well in our green room on our discord server, which by the way, you don't just have to use the discord server for calling us.
5914141	5917584	You can also leave us messages throughout the week.
5917584	5919445	We have a pretty active chat channel there.
5919981	5922163	I promise we keep the pings to a minimum.
5922163	5924884	In fact, I almost want to say that it's non existent.
5924884	5926826	I don't remember the last time we ever did an everyone ping.
5926826	5928907	I don't think it actually happens there.
5928907	5934250	But we do it does inform you of new VOG Network content in the channels without a ping.
5934250	5936812	If you ever want to stay on top of what's happening around the network.
5936812	5941855	So again, vognetwork.com slash discord is the place to get on our discord server.
5941855	5944237	Let's get to a couple other last stories here, Loki.
5945578	5952583	Yeah, so Valve has apparently closed a loophole in their Steam refund policy.
5952583	5963711	The way people were explaining it is games that had advanced access, which is essentially playtime that's prior to the game's release, so think of like...
5964636	5966697	I mean, in this case, it would have been a positive.
5966697	5972199	But like, let's think about like Suicide Squad, where if I paid a little extra money, I get to play it three days early.
5972199	5979582	Well, apparently some people were buying games with that advanced access, beating said game within that time period.
5979582	5990147	And then because Valve didn't start the clock until release day, they were able to go ahead and refund the title before that.
5990147	5991948	It took them that long to fix that?
5991948	5992328	Damn.
5994116	5995116	Yeah, I'm surprised.
5995116	6003119	But yeah, now, now it's essentially going to be I think, yeah, now it's that purchase time instead of, you know, the release date.
6003119	6009002	So I think it's probably a small subset of people that were doing that.
6009002	6012743	But you know, at least they've kind of fixed that.
6012743	6017145	So if there's a way people can be shitty, count on it.
6017145	6018045	Yep.
6018045	6019206	All right.
6019206	6019826	Such is life.
6020752	6025215	And by the way, this goes to gaming corporations as well, because I don't know about this one.
6025215	6026295	This is pretty wild.
6026295	6035961	But there is a game and I, I actually, yes, I don't know this game, Loki, you might have to fill me in on what this is all about, because it looks like a shooty shooty bang bang game.
6035961	6038463	Yeah, it's a game called Escape from Tarkov.
6039788	6046595	Yeah, it's a so escape from Tarkov is a what they call it an extraction shooter.
6046595	6063070	So essentially, what you're doing is you're entering into like a giant war zone map or whatever, and you have to go get valuable assets or things from the map and then escape out of the map you need to extract yourself before being killed by someone else which
6063450	6067614	ToBeFair was kind of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer mode, which I fucking loved.
6067614	6070076	Like, so, you know, I like the extraction games.
6070076	6070577	That's fine.
6070577	6072038	I don't have a problem with that.
6072038	6074681	Yeah, I do have a problem with some things I'm hearing about this.
6074681	6081167	So there's so this game has been in beta for six years, which I didn't realize it's been a beta a very long time.
6081167	6086312	But now they're getting closer and closer to release and they are going to be releasing the game in different tiers.
6086792	6090216	which usually have I know we joke about the collectors editions in Japan.
6090216	6094241	That's just because they do all sorts of shitty digital collectors editions here.
6094241	6095443	And this game is no different.
6095443	6099728	There's going to be the unheard edition of this game $250 for this game.
6103410	6116798	By the way, there is content in this $250 version that is not in the $120 version of the game, which promised free access to all subsequent DLCs or Season Pass.
6117904	6124506	So there is a persistent PVE mode, which I'm going to assume means the extraction never happens.
6124506	6126766	You just keep going and going, going till you can't anymore.
6126766	6128126	That's usually what persistent, I think.
6128126	6128807	I don't know.
6128807	6133168	I guess that could mean a lot of things, but there is a new mode called persistent PVE mode.
6133168	6138829	You cannot get it in the $120 version, even though they promised all the DLC and that.
6139948	6157443	It's an offline type of thing, so you're playing against AI enemies, and you can also bring your friends in as well, and apparently you can use your pre-level character, and you get other perks that's kind of more pay-to-win as well with it.
6157443	6163108	Yeah, but yeah, it really comes down to the people that dropped $120 for a game that's not finished yet, and then they're like,
6164500	6174307	Oh, by the way, we want you to pay $250 to get this, but they're like, but hey, you know, well, is there a battle pass in this too?
6174307	6179851	Because they're talking about pay to win elements, pre leveled player skills.
6179851	6182393	Sounds really nickel and dime in the audience.
6182393	6184235	Yeah, they're gonna discount to 30 bucks.
6184235	6186636	So you only have to pay an extra $100 to upgrade if you want.
6186636	6187217	Oh, Lord.
6188346	6190808	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6206806	6212130	Since 2016, players have supported the developers by purchasing the highest edition of the game.
6212130	6217935	For eight years, we've been recommending this game to friends, bringing more and more players into the community.
6217935	6219856	And what was the developers' response?
6219856	6226822	They've blown us off, refused to comment, and only encouraged those who have lost all respect for themselves and continue to pour money in.
6227242	6229082	I personally had high hopes for Tarkov.
6229082	6233243	In my eyes, it was a high quality and most ambitious product on the entire market.
6233243	6234744	This is unacceptable.
6234744	6235944	This is selfish.
6235944	6237484	This is disrespectful.
6237484	6239384	You've disgraced yourselves completely.
6239384	6241545	You've lost loyal players.
6241545	6243005	You've betrayed the idea.
6243005	6246306	It's disgusting to everyone who feels the same way.
6246306	6247306	Don't be silent.
6247306	6248166	Spam.
6248166	6249166	Make memes.
6249166	6250527	Spread the word.
6250527	6252427	Do dramatic readings on podcasts.
6252427	6253787	Well, I guess I added that.
6253787	6256728	Wherever it's relevant, this cannot be tolerated.
6258109	6262332	So damn, people are pissed, yo.
6262332	6265434	Yeah, that's something to take for the but I get of course they are.
6265434	6267115	They have every right to be to be quite honest.
6268186	6274011	When fans support a game only to have the developer do this shit is really gross.
6274011	6288404	I understand developers have to get paid, but I also understand the planning should be there to be able to make that happen successfully without withholding modes from people who were under the reasonable assumption that they were buying the full version of the game.
6288404	6288805	Everything.
6291445	6297547	QuestBuster points out BSG first tried to say that the PVE mode wasn't DLC, even though it sounds exactly like DLC.
6297547	6299167	It's DLC.
6299167	6305429	They're trying to make it legally distinct because now this is smelling like a class action lawsuit.
6305429	6313271	Well, they've walked stuff back too, obviously, because they're in panic, you know, put out fire mode, but they've walked it back.
6313271	6315612	Stuff like, for example, PVE access, they said.
6316112	6321715	We've just decided to open it up to EOD owners for free, but we'll do it in waves.
6321715	6324737	As I said before, we don't have server capacity right now.
6324737	6326778	We will start the process as soon as possible.
6326778	6332581	We also decided that we'll add mod support for PVE mode after the release of the game.
6332581	6335343	About Unheard Edition, we will not remove it.
6335343	6343527	We want to keep the option for those who want to support the game more, but we will balance items, perks into this edition as we provide more rewards for those, blah, blah, blah.
6346368	6353856	And then, let's see here, I was trying to see what the responses of some of the stuff.
6353856	6357040	Yeah, none of it's really informative.
6357040	6358462	Yeah.
6358462	6360464	Anyway, there you go.
6360464	6364288	It's not like it was a game that was on my radar anyway, and now it's really not on my radar.
6364288	6365710	So congrats on that one, folks.
6366801	6378411	Yeah, and that's what that's what a lot of people that have been saying, especially like those folks that were considering streaming on like their their communities and saying, Hey, why don't you stream on Tarkov or whatever?
6378411	6381834	And then now they see this like, Nope, not anymore.
6381834	6383415	Not touching that one.
6383415	6384076	Good job.
6384076	6391662	How a bad boardroom decision can tank your entire fucking game in six easy steps, or even one easy step to be quite honest.
6393092	6394553	All right.
6394553	6396214	With that, we get to the Lister Roundtable.
6396214	6401176	If you guys have any questions for us, we'd love to see them in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6401176	6403137	We do always take a moment to check the mailbag.
6403137	6405499	I think it's empty this week, but let me verify that with DarkSakura.
6405499	6405639	It is.
6405639	6406659	It's full of crickets.
6406659	6407220	All right.
6407220	6415864	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to, you know, help dust off the mailbag because it's getting a little stanky with the lack of emails.
6415864	6420627	At least we had a couple for our thousandth episode, but I guess I guess those are the last emails we're ever going to get.
6420627	6422168	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.
6423188	6426490	Uh, let me check in with I don't see anyone in our green room either.
6426490	6427210	So I don't know.
6427210	6428191	We're going to wrap up soon.
6428191	6431272	But let me check with Loki here and see if there's any last minute stories you want to get to.
6431272	6440216	Yeah, I was going to say that there was a brand new fan game released for it's a Sonic fan game, actually.
6440216	6443237	It's Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers.
6443237	6449880	It's a fan made, I guess, SRB to Ring Racer with 200 plus tracks.
6452061	6460305	and local split-screen multiplayer, online play for up to 16 players, a whole bunch of mechanics and stuff like that.
6460305	6468928	You can go to KartCrew, both with K's, .org and download it for free.
6468928	6473850	And it looks, it's like a quasi, like, it's like a combination between, like,
6475376	6481099	Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart because it's got 2D sprites, but it's a 3D map.
6481099	6482180	Kind of interesting.
6482180	6484341	I'm kind of curious about this because it looks kind of interesting.
6484341	6484881	Oh, they do.
6484881	6486682	They do link to a trailer here.
6486682	6488483	That's obviously.
6488483	6490324	Yeah, and they did that like in the style of an old.
6490324	6493226	Oh, I don't know if I like that.
6493226	6496568	They kind of did the old style with it, but OK.
6496568	6498068	Well, that's what the game looks like.
6498068	6500670	I mean, not that blurry, but it's like that.
6500670	6500950	No.
6500950	6501170	Yeah.
6501170	6504312	But the blurry is is a choice, but that's all right.
6505666	6506347	Interesting.
6506347	6507908	That's for a fan product.
6507908	6509190	That's still very impressive.
6509190	6509850	That's pretty cool.
6509850	6511892	Yeah.
6511892	6516977	But yeah, using that effect on your trailer, that's a choice, my friends.
6516977	6518639	I don't know if that was a good idea.
6518639	6521902	All right.
6521902	6523444	Anything else, Loki?
6523444	6524225	That's it.
6524225	6525306	All right.
6525306	6528028	Well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap it up.
6529016	6532560	So thank you all so much for being here tonight and participating with the show.
6532560	6540988	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6540988	6542250	Spread the word.
6542250	6542930	Tell friends.
6542930	6549577	A five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show goes an awful long way as well.
6549577	6551519	We really appreciate that.
6551519	6552040	Yeah, so
6552560	6556541	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again, but let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
6556541	6560663	First, DarkSakura, I'm sure you're going to be streaming after the show tonight.
6560663	6562984	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
6562984	6565764	Um, I need a nap.
6565764	6566785	Amen to that.
6566785	6567405	Come hang out.
6567405	6567905	All right.
6567905	6568665	Well, don't nap yet.
6568665	6570266	You got streaming to do.
6570266	6571666	I know.
6571666	6573607	You know, not not for not terribly long.
6573607	6575748	We're just going to go around and smack some people around.
6575748	6576308	That's all.
6576308	6576888	Sounds like fun.
6576888	6577488	All right.
6577488	6578749	Have a good one.
6578749	6579029	Later.
6579454	6581078	Thank you for watching!
6590934	6596379	Alright, my final thought is I'm riding a high from the show I hosted here locally last night.
6596379	6603465	It was a good time and always thankful to the Scream Queens Gorlesks here in Sacramento for having me.
6603465	6604486	And we had a really good time.
6604486	6615997	We had some awesome guest performers, which from the television show Dragula, which is like it's like Drag Race, but spooky and very, very well done in the art direction department.
