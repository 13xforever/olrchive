1109	2931	Okay, hi, we're here.
2931	9818	It's episode 1000 of Orange Sounds Radio tonight, which is pretty wild to think about.
9818	19849	But we thought, yeah, we thought for this special occasion, we would, well, first, we're together in person for the first time since COVID happened, actually, which is
20249	23430	All of us, yeah, which is pretty wild to think about.
23430	26091	So that's been a real treat.
26091	37356	We actually thought we would kind of do the special opening tonight at the diner that's right over there that is surprisingly still open after... We all met, what, like 24 years ago?
38576	40597	We met all that time ago, and it's wild that that's still open.
40597	42217	Golfland's still open, which is really the place where we met.
58161	81572	It's it but it's also kind of like interestingly I guess poetic in a way that like all these places are still going and here we are still going uh this time later I don't know it's it's neat to think about but things change they don't have cheese sticks anymore no mozzarella sticks no what the heck no and there's no DDR machines or probably anything that doesn't spit out tickets in there at all
83793	87256	No, if you want to see that, you're going to go to round one on the other side of the freeway at this point.
87256	89097	That's what the good stuff is.
89097	90878	That's the newfangled stuff.
90878	97023	That would be like the new podcasts about DDR and that sort of thing that probably have no idea we exist.
97023	97683	And that's fine.
97683	103207	Back in our days, we went to Gothland to play the deeters.
103207	106690	We're the senior citizens of gaming podcasting at this point.
106690	107090	Aren't you still?
107170	110651	So on tonight's show obviously we'll talk a lot about you know just
137455	163485	how it feels to be a thousand years old or whatever we're celebrating tonight um but let me let me ask this question to kind of start us off at the top one thousand episodes in from june 2002 hi oh you should have been filming this the whole time okay look look alternate angle a thousand episode in a thousand episodes in some things don't change we're still making it up as we go along um
169247	171948	What's the secret to longevity with a podcast?
171948	172568	Fake it.
172568	173808	No.
173808	176489	So I was gonna say 1,000 episodes in.
176489	178910	Let me just ask this right at the top.
178910	180090	How does it feel?
180090	183711	How does it feel from June to now?
183711	184191	June 2002 to now?
184191	184592	I don't know.
186849	193313	And if the chat room is saying get a tripod, I don't want to hear it.
193313	194393	I don't want to hear it, look.
204548	212335	At a lot of different like panels about podcasting and things at Dragon Call and stuff, people are like, oh, we got to have the right equipment.
212335	213837	What equipment do you need to podcast?
213837	214718	What do you need to do?
214718	216499	You don't need anything.
216499	217580	You need a phone.
217580	219282	You need a phone and a dream.
219282	224547	And if this doesn't show that, if nothing else, all you need is a phone.
224547	228611	You need a tin can microphone from RadioShack because they were still around in 2002 and a dream.
229972	232694	I forgot I have lavalier mics that go with iPhones.
232694	233855	Oops.
233855	234915	Oh well.
234915	236416	Okay.
236416	238498	Tangents, they're inevitable.
238498	239979	How does it feel?
239979	240879	I'll go to you then, Loki.
240879	243021	How does it feel, 1,000 episodes?
243021	244321	It feels exactly the same.
244321	244902	I don't know.
244902	253808	It's hard to think about time like that because we hit all these different milestones that seem kind of ridiculous and now it's just part of our life.
253808	258751	It is literally getting to the point now, we're almost past, where I have been doing this show more
259171	260452	Thank you for watching!
280630	282752	Wow, look at this show now.
282752	286314	I've just discovered them because they've hit a thousand episodes.
286314	287575	But no, it's fine.
287575	288696	It'll be just our community.
288696	291798	There's a thousand podcasts putting out their first episode this week.
291798	294620	And it can be a real struggle to kind of stand out sometimes.
294620	296441	But that's what it is, right?
296441	297942	Exactly.
297942	299863	We're fortunate to have the group that we have.
299863	305487	You know, I'm pretty sure we're going to have a nice, solid chat show up tonight for the show.
305487	308949	And it's a lot of faces that we've seen throughout the last few months.
310250	312692	Travis, thank you for having me on Under Sedation a lot.
312692	318236	And sometimes you can wear a bra on your head and call yourself Queen Amidala.
335149	341195	I would say this show just simply doesn't exist if not for Jason.
341195	354969	I think our voiceover guy Jason, I don't think many of you understand from a technical, support, financial, oftentimes, and all that stuff perspective how Jason has really helped keep this show afloat.
357051	357491	Bobby Blackwell
378044	379705	the first time.
379705	394737	You know, our long history from Live365 to where we're at now on Twitch, Bobby kind of saved us from pulling the plug when Live365 was no longer a viable option for us.
394737	398059	You know, and then that's... Which is, by the way, Live365 is still there.
398059	400321	They are, but it's a different thing now.
400321	406205	I know, but I just think it's funny speaking of the things before that were still... It's like LiveJournal's still there, but it's not really LiveJournal.
406205	406625	Right.
406625	407406	I still have a permanent
407706	409627	I know, I know.
409627	424991	And that is even outside of just like, or that's even just like, then the friendship that we have, and you know, just having the whole, as he puts it, opening act, which, you know, we don't really see it the same way, but we see it as co-headlining, but all these years.
424991	426791	So obviously Bobby's been instrumental in that.
426791	431153	And there's, God, there's so many other people, like on a personal level.
431153	433613	I'm always worried about thanking people, because I'm gonna leave people out.
433613	435054	Hey, people.
435054	435394	Thanks.
436007	447775	Yeah, if you're watching this, seriously, or listening to this, thanks, because it's really everybody showing up to the table that has kept us.
447775	451878	I have to remember to do thank you and not this way, because this means bitch.
451878	453739	I'm not calling y'all bitches, I'm saying thank you.
453739	458122	Just, yeah, thanks for being a part of our lives for the last 21 years.
458122	458723	Absolutely.
458723	462986	And thank you for letting us be a part of yours, even if it's for a few hours.
462986	463246	Yeah.
463886	471234	So, um, with that, I guess we will start the official intro to episode number 1,000.
471234	474397	Too much metal for one hand?
474397	475057	That's us.
475057	475958	Two hands.
475958	476459	Two hands.
476459	476939	Split it up.
476939	477820	Two hands.
477820	478461	Two hands.
478461	480663	No, we're too much metal for one hand.
480663	482605	Instead of like that, we're like that.
482605	483346	Roll the intro.
493430	498912	The Pretendo Group is breathing new life into the Wii U's online capabilities with nothing but a DNS change.
498912	506774	I'm stuck in the middle of my gaming fandom enjoyment of this reveal, my awe of the technical elegance, but my concern for any possible future ramifications.
506774	511656	I've successfully buried the lead because this is the 1,000th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
511656	515717	And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to talk about that.
515717	519439	And the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on this show's 1,000th episode.
523510	549444	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back once again dare I say for the 1000th time to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight April the 14th of 2024 with episode number have you heard 1000 of our show as we have been doing every week since June 2002 until now
552586	579702	here we are and here all of you are and honestly because we do tape live of course every Sunday night nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG Network and I am blushing because you all are like going wild with this hype train in chat right now we are up to a level 11 hype train on chat that is huge
580402	581724	Hi DarkSakura or JamieSummers.
581724	582004	Hello.
582004	582605	What?
582605	584447	What?
584447	585608	But this one goes to 11.
585608	588171	It does.
588171	590493	Literally this episode is going to 11.
590493	596260	That is how you celebrate a thousand episodes is you just turn it up even louder.
596260	598162	Hi DarkSakura or JamieSummers.
598162	600104	It is great to see you.
600925	612475	For those that are listening on the podcast feed, DarkSakura has put her VTuber in the bin for tonight and has put on her best drag to be here for you all live in person.
612475	615198	This is not my best drag, but it's suitable.
615198	616098	You look lovely.
616098	617199	Thank you.
617199	623185	Now that means I can go back to terrorizing everybody with doing weird stuff on cam.
623185	625687	Just remember, the podcasters are still here.
625687	626848	We love our podcast crowd too.
627188	628229	Yeah, we love you.
628229	633151	But, but I still like to play with the camera.
633151	635913	But yeah, I'm here.
635913	637874	And we'll catch up a little more in just a minute.
637874	645098	Let's say hello as well, of course, to the one and only playing with the camera with games in his background as we're streaming live here on Twitch.
645098	647299	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
647299	647839	Hello.
647839	649460	Hi, how are you Loki?
649460	650340	Doing pretty good.
650340	652061	What is this game behind you tonight?
652061	653082	I don't recognize it.
653082	654482	It's gotta be a pun on 1000 somehow.
655808	657411	It is not a pun on 1000.
657411	660036	It is a brand new game that just came out.
660036	663703	It is the video game adaptation of Turbo Kid.
663703	667590	So Turbo Kid is kind of like a cult classic.
669698	674321	post apocalyptic kind of 80s style movie.
674321	678564	And this game kind of takes place after the events of that movie.
678564	682987	And it's a great metroidvania game that I will talk about a little bit more later.
682987	684908	Okay, I was getting metroidvania vibes from it.
684908	686229	You know, I love me a metroidvania.
686229	687870	So that's, that's great.
687870	689992	I think you have some friends in chat tonight.
689992	691993	You must have put up on your YouTube channel.
692173	699075	Hello to all of you in chat, what a great turnout and again, we're all blushing all sorts of colors here with the hype train you have going.
710238	737909	uh money to keep ourselves a legit business and all that but thanks to the generosity of you all it's it's very little out of pocket we have to do to do that so it helps us helps us do the show for free uh which we love to do we've loved to do this for every week for the last thousand weeks and um we're gonna keep it going tonight um i hope you all enjoyed uh our little reminiscing intro tonight we really did go out to golf land today uh we were originally going to record that at the diner
738689	747597	But silly me in planning this whole thing kind of forgot like, oh, it's Sunday after church brunch crowd.
747597	752482	It was packed and very, very noisy when we used to go after golf land nights.
752482	755605	It was very quiet in there because we were usually the only ones in there that late.
756165	757927	So it was a very different vibe today.
757927	758908	So oops.
758908	761271	So we had to mix it up a little bit.
761271	763394	So but I hope you enjoy a special intro tonight.
763394	765656	And hello to all of you in chat.
765656	766477	I gave a shout out.
766477	767338	Yes.
767338	771263	Arrington20 says Loki fan club lol Yes, got the shout out for that.
771263	775287	Missingno1115 says love you guys been listening for 15 years.
777617	779978	No, I don't I don't feel old at all tonight.
779978	780718	No, I love that.
780718	781158	I love it.
781158	783559	No, y'all making me blush.
783559	785519	I some of you have been listening for a very long time.
785519	796603	And I think it's really a testament to you all that have helped us get this far by being here and supporting and giving us things to talk about and making it so that we're not just talking to ourselves.
796603	800404	I do like to think we would have a lot of fun with the show if we were talking to ourselves.
800404	803165	I mean, that opening tonight was just us talking to ourselves.
803165	803425	But
804065	808387	This show is just that much more elevated because you are all here and you're a part of it.
808387	811589	And I just I can't thank you enough.
811589	812549	Yeah.
812549	820253	So usually at the top of the show, we would do a kickoff topic talking about something going on in video games.
820253	828357	But since, you know, the news this week would be this is, you know, not to toot our own horn too much, but you know what?
828357	829018	God damn it.
829018	832099	After 1000 episodes to fucking toot.
832099	833340	We are the news.
835575	837277	This is a historical thing.
837277	842781	We are the first podcast to hit 1000 weekly episodes.
842781	848406	Yes, there's, you know, and again, I've said this a million times, there's other people that count the numbers differently and do all these things.
848406	851289	I'm never here to crap on anybody else and the accomplishments.
851289	857334	Quite honestly, if you have put out five episodes of a podcast, you've done an incredible fucking thing that not a lot of people do.
858155	860997	So I'm never here to poop on anyone else's accomplishments.
860997	865961	There's lots of great, you know, accomplishments things have done and measured in different ways.
865961	866962	And that's great.
866962	876810	But, you know, for us, having done this in an era before podcasting, really continue a merging it into podcasting before iTunes was in the game.
876810	882234	And now to where we're at now is just, yeah, it's, it's, it's been a hell of a run.
882234	885157	And I thought we'd take some time at the beginning of the show to
885797	888399	answer a few questions, panel style.
888399	891381	You know I love me a panel at a fan convention.
891381	893102	I'll be at DragonCon, Labor Day weekend, by the way.
893102	894923	Hope to see you there.
894923	902348	And we'll answer a few questions about this show and what it means to be at 1,000 episodes.
902348	905970	And if you want to add some in chat, I'll try to catch some in chat.
905970	907851	There's a lot of you in there tonight.
907851	911994	I'm glad you all... Oh, that's a fancy animated emoji everybody got tonight for the hype train.
911994	912994	That's pretty cool.
912994	913154	So
914295	917177	If you have other questions, we'll try to get to as many as we can.
917177	929264	But here are a few submitted online, submitted, just asking me personally about it or texting me, or yeah, me begging people ask us a question for tonight, and so forth.
929264	932786	Here are some questions to jump in.
932786	937669	So the first question tonight, here on one on episode 1000.
937669	941992	What would you go back and change about episode one?
943243	946864	Is there anything you'd go back and change about episode one?
946864	947945	Loki, I'll start with you.
947945	950485	What would you go back and change about episode one?
950485	954267	I mean, we could have had some better mics, but I mean, that's fine.
954267	957748	It's like the first episode and we're on dial up at that point.
957748	960169	I mean, it wouldn't really matter.
960169	963110	Like, it just wouldn't.
963110	965430	No, I wouldn't change anything.
965430	965850	Maybe more chairs.
965850	966471	I would change one thing.
966471	969152	We could get some more chairs.
969152	970092	DarkSakura, what would you change?
971098	974221	The freaking migraine I had through the first episode.
974221	975422	Oh, my God.
975422	978484	My head was a wreck.
978484	981547	Other than that, it was it was cool to do.
981547	983809	It was like ours.
983809	984770	It was our thing.
984770	993517	Yeah, we we we said we're we're going to to produce this spawn of our brains.
993517	996340	And and it was good.
996340	998462	I like the vibe of a clusterfuck, but it was good.
999198	1011829	Yeah, I like the vibe of the first episode because it was kind of like, it would be like recording a podcast in the middle of like a party kind of environment almost, or nerd party, if you will.
1011829	1015172	Because it was just like that in the first couple years.
1015172	1023419	Yeah, honestly, yeah, it was it was just like, people coming over hanging out playing, you know, music games and stuff like that.
1023419	1023799	And just
1024580	1028303	people sliding in and out of like, hey, I got something to say on the mic.
1028303	1029164	Let me say something.
1029164	1030345	Hey, let's talk about this.
1030345	1041674	Let's you know, it it was just kind of very casual, you know, and very informal, kind of a really fun vibe before I think the first few episodes, our first few years, actually.
1041674	1044997	So now we're completely professional.
1044997	1047639	So we know that's behind us, of course.
1047639	1049581	But yeah, it was a lot of fun.
1050017	1050818	Yeah, it's interesting.
1050818	1053000	A couple answers I would have for this.
1053000	1068593	There is a part of me that almost wishes the early episodes had a little more structure, but I also feel like the complete and utter lack of structure was kind of what made it special and what made it a lot of fun and had that atmosphere.
1071055	1074859	you know, the language differences in the year 2002.
1074859	1079965	Like I know we went back, I think when we hit our 19th anniversary, we went back and listened to episode one.
1079965	1081808	And we honestly thought it would be a lot worse.
1081808	1086012	But I think I caught the R slur in there, which, you know, language has changed.
1086733	1090195	Um, and you know, there's been awareness and advocation and so forth.
1090195	1093237	So obviously some of that is regrettable.
1093237	1095718	But you know, it's it is an artifact of the year 2002.
1095718	1100140	Yeah, so some of that I wish was different.
1100140	1106364	It is it isn't it doesn't age well, but I also recognize we didn't we didn't know better now we do.
1107662	1126932	Right, and it was also like, yeah, there are some things that I think, jokes that we, we kind of took, like, kind of the whole, um, oh, uh, Cards Against Humanity type of humor, you know, and thought that was kind of cool for a lot of, like, some of the jokes that we made on there, but it isn't always that funny.
1127392	1129515	There are a lot of stupid things you do and say in your 20s.
1129515	1130456	That's just how it is.
1143473	1172919	find find me I can't go back and change anything so somebody who's perfect there's gonna be things that shows that start today there's gonna be things that for shows that start today that look back in 20 years and we go oh that didn't that didn't age well you know that there it's just it's gonna it's gonna happen we can learn from it and we can do better and I hope everybody has found that that has been the case here I hope so we want to create a welcoming environment because everybody or gaming is for everyone period
1173988	1177570	And to respond to SSJ100 Matt's, I'll friend your bud.
1177570	1179271	That wasn't any of us that said that.
1179271	1182533	That was from that Seaman video.
1182533	1184894	So it was the person who did the Seaman video.
1184894	1187936	We need to find them and send them like some cookies.
1187936	1188336	Yeah.
1188336	1189017	Some, yeah.
1189477	1191638	Thank you for the material.
1191638	1193960	We're not going to friend your butt, but we'll give you a cookie.
1193960	1195701	We can't even remember the YouTuber's name.
1195701	1199063	Maybe somebody out there knows that I because I really do not know.
1199063	1199563	So.
1199563	1201164	All right.
1201164	1211510	Let's get to the next question, which would be what is the secret to keeping it all going for this long?
1211510	1215833	DarkSakura, what is the secret to keeping it all going for this long?
1215833	1216253	Habit.
1220936	1223420	My Sunday doesn't feel right without it.
1232372	1248656	You know, just like doing anything that you find enjoyable, that you, you know, are gratified by, and that you feel connected to other people with, you know, why do people do convention circuits for years?
1248656	1249617	Why- Yeah, Ranma.
1249617	1254078	Why do- Well, I wasn't just thinking about- I'm calling him out.
1254078	1254878	I'm calling him out.
1254878	1256058	No, I'm just kidding.
1256058	1256638	Nothing but love.
1256638	1258599	Why- Why do-
1259608	1265170	You know, why no matter whatever happens, I always go back to do stuff in Mass Effect.
1265170	1272572	I mean, it's kind of just like... Why is Loki's gaming week always fucking Minecraft?
1272572	1275613	Like, there's certain comfort food.
1275613	1277873	I only have time for that.
1277873	1280034	Why do I play Dead by Daylight?
1280034	1281854	You know, at least twice a week.
1281854	1284895	I mean, I used to play every... Final Fantasy 14, just as bad.
1284895	1286916	We're all guilty of our comfort food games, right?
1288065	1289345	It's just the thing.
1289345	1293086	It's what we do.
1293086	1299287	I can't put an immediate why on it, I guess, or a how.
1299287	1303528	We just keep doing it, and we keep trying to do it better.
1303528	1308969	But unless somebody wants to just give us a gift of $25,000... That's a pretty good start tonight.
1312682	1319188	Y'all are paying the bills for the next couple months, so thank you.
1329051	1329992	Twitch Twitch
1355119	1377955	It's like this really weird extended family, you know, it kind of is almost like that community feeling I used to get back on AOL back in the day where you had your RP friends and you would always meet in like the town square of Sailor Moon or Kuno's Island or whatever that sparring ring room was.
1377955	1381618	And, uh, you know, hang out with, with your friends.
1381618	1383860	It's just our, our weekly hangout.
1383860	1384060	Yeah.
1384460	1391567	You know, and we talk about video game news because I have something to talk about that isn't food.
1391567	1392888	Well, or drag race.
1392888	1394549	And we all like video games for sure.
1394549	1397432	But and all those other topics come up too.
1397432	1399874	I would I would really kind of copy that answer.
1399874	1401476	Look over your shoulder and write the same thing.
1401476	1405059	Because I think habit is a big part of our community.
1405619	1417947	It is ironic that our original plan today got blasted out a little bit by the church crowds because I think in some ways this is a very similar thing to church.
1417947	1430815	I've made this analogy before, and again, I'm not trying to sound like it's actually religious or spiritual or anything like that, but I think church is a very big habit for a lot of people that is community and all of that.
1430815	1432336	Are you saying we're a cult?
1432876	1434719	No, I am not saying we're a cult.
1434719	1435881	Ex-exempt status.
1435881	1436682	Woo!
1436682	1437964	Woo!
1437964	1439506	The Church of OLR.
1439506	1446096	This is that thing that people show up to to hear Loki preach about what fucked up thing Nintendo did this week.
1447955	1450757	But no, in all seriousness, like this is this is that community.
1450757	1452178	It's still that community.
1452178	1452578	It's habit.
1452578	1456501	And the habit part is huge, is huge.
1456501	1457962	You really do have to prioritize.
1457962	1460344	You want the secret to keeping it all going for this long.
1460344	1462025	You have to prioritize it.
1462025	1467148	The minute you start making excuses for why the show can't happen, the show's going to slip.
1467148	1471852	And there have been weeks that we've missed, but we really try to keep that
1472572	1473432	Sparing.
1473432	1482937	Like even when, and we've all had tragedy, but personally, when my mom passed away, I really worked to get back here after two weeks.
1482937	1496823	And that's not, you know, it's, it's, it's just because I kind of needed OLR as that, like, I need to find my routine again and find normalcy and what doesn't feel normal in that whole situation.
1496823	1497564	Yeah.
1497564	1500605	So, I mean, God, I mean, like,
1501778	1510964	We've all lost people in our lives throughout the show and we've all kind of been here for each other, I think.
1510964	1512665	Absolutely.
1512665	1515747	And we've seen people born.
1515747	1519869	Loki's got Spawn now, you know, friends of the show.
1519869	1520730	When in high school.
1521030	1532772	I was just getting texted pictures of the Mels who were here on episode six, I think, back because Mel B was a huge freestyler in DDR and his wife and I have been BFFs for a long time.
1532772	1536833	But I was getting pictures of their daughter, you know, today.
1536833	1539313	You know, Melody and I are sort of co-workers right now.
1539313	1541974	Yeah, it's small world.
1541974	1542734	It's great.
1542734	1545194	I'm co-workers with Drew.
1545194	1548235	Loki, let me... I need to text his butt and say, get in the chat.
1548993	1549954	Loki.
1549954	1550254	Yeah.
1550254	1550835	Oh, and that.
1550835	1552196	Oh my god, BigRedPimp in chat.
1552196	1552597	I'm so sorry.
1552597	1553938	I'm not trying to ignore chat.
1553938	1554799	I am reading.
1554799	1556380	But some of these comments here.
1556380	1561165	BigRedPimp says, you all are to blame for Angel and I getting married somehow.
1561165	1563147	It was you all your fault.
1563147	1564969	It is it blow there.
1564969	1567531	There have been relationships because of this show.
1567531	1570594	And that blows my fucking mind.
1571684	1574765	There's been shows made because of this show.
1574765	1577146	That is the ultimate compliment, by the way.
1577146	1585328	People that have done their own podcast as a result of what they maybe heard here and thought, just like we learned from Travis Donovan at Under Station Live.
1585328	1587049	Shout out if you're out there, Travis.
1587049	1591670	Just like we learned from Travis, any idiot podcast that I say that would love.
1591670	1594091	Some people have learned that lesson from us.
1594091	1596832	It doesn't take expensive equipment to do it.
1596832	1596972	So
1598177	1600938	Anyway, Loki, I didn't let you have a stab at the question.
1600938	1602438	I want to make sure you you had a chance.
1602438	1604918	What's the secret to keeping it all going for this long?
1604918	1608379	Stubborn determination.
1608379	1609179	I mean, that's it.
1609179	1611060	I mean, it's just is routine.
1611060	1613520	I mean, it's, I don't know.
1613520	1616681	It's just the see how long it goes.
1616681	1622762	I just when I do I do something and then I, I keep doing it until I'm forced not to do it anymore.
1622762	1623462	Like, you know, it's
1624705	1625647	Just what it is.
1625647	1626669	I love that answer too.
1626669	1629214	I just kind of want to see what happens.
1629214	1631277	I just kind of want to see what happens.
1633666	1635788	Alright, next question.
1635788	1637509	And this was via Twitter.
1637509	1638390	Thank you.
1638390	1641412	Will you be voting for President Kat this election?
1641412	1643274	Oh, this game.
1643274	1650559	It's it's funny to me that you know, we haven't made a lot of headway with gaming press with this milestone, which is fine.
1650559	1654042	I didn't blast everybody with a press release or anything like that.
1654042	1660668	And it's, you know, because I think sometimes the lack of exposure is actually kind of nice.
1661747	1665531	It's kind of nice that we don't have a lot of shitbags that come in this chat room.
1665531	1677142	And the unfortunate thing is if we were out there large on this big scale where people would, you know, want to find us and try to get a reaction out of us, we'd see a lot more shitbags in chat.
1677142	1680405	So sometimes being on this kind of like
1681653	1687839	hipster underground have you heard of this show kind of level is actually a really cool thing.
1687839	1689301	But we are still underground.
1689301	1692203	But it's interesting to me that President Cat was the thing.
1692203	1700411	And just dumb little Twitter campaign we were running to try to get this game localized and brought to the USA actually ended up getting more press than anything else.
1701272	1703053	Um, that was pretty funny though.
1703053	1703653	It was funny.
1703653	1705254	It was really funny.
1705254	1716921	Um, but it, and I also feel it's like the earliest form, not that we were the first, but it was the earliest form of that whole Reddit article or Reddit post becomes a story that every other game blog posts about.
1716921	1722324	So anyway, Bobby Blackwell says, well, that and Katamari, we don't talk about her.
1722324	1723345	All right.
1723345	1724985	Anyway, we do.
1724985	1726686	We love that series.
1726686	1728848	We don't, we don't talk about the incident trademark.
1729768	1731710	It's on Wikipedia somewhere and that's all you need.
1731710	1734513	Alright, back to the question.
1734513	1743722	For the record, there's like a post from a year ago, like a year ago, on Reddit, that says, do I have to make a full English translation of Tsukuba no Shachou Rena?
1745114	1748678	I think we were contacted about trying to find that episode.
1748678	1750399	So somebody's doing something.
1750399	1753202	So we'll, we'll say, I hope they do it.
1753202	1756325	They are, they are, by the way, working, making it to run on a dolphin.
1756325	1757526	I love it.
1757526	1757867	Yeah.
1757867	1764573	And the other story that got a lot of hits, you may have forgot the guitar, the guitar hero rocks the eighties or something like that.
1764573	1767976	I think we're on a Wikipedia article for that too, when that all happened.
1767976	1769218	So anyway.
1770287	1772709	We don't have an actual Wikipedia article anymore, sadly.
1772709	1774670	It got deleted because we're not notable enough.
1774670	1780295	Do you think now that we have a thousand fucking episodes we can get a Wikipedia article again?
1780295	1784939	No, because they'll be like, well, yeah, but no one's listened to you, so it's fine.
1784939	1785459	Fuck them.
1785459	1786540	Let's make one.
1786540	1787581	Somebody get on top of that.
1788223	1795565	Maybe somebody else will acknowledge this show that's not Wikipedia, but somebody we really love to acknowledge this show.
1795565	1796465	Wink, wink, wink.
1796465	1801166	I hope in the near future I can say something about it because I would love to talk about it.
1801166	1803166	Wink, wink, if you're out there.
1803166	1803546	All right.
1803546	1806347	Anyway, let's go back to the question.
1806347	1809948	Will you be voting for President Kat this election?
1809948	1811788	DarkSakura, will you be voting for President Kat this election?
1812677	1816299	Do you want the real answer or the I wish I could answer?
1816299	1819061	Whatever you feel like giving on episode 1000.
1819061	1820382	I wish I could.
1820382	1827647	I think a cat would do better than anyone we've had since Obama.
1827647	1830388	Loki, will you be voting for President Cat this election?
1830388	1832450	No, I will not be voting for President Cat.
1834162	1834702	DarkSakura,
1857236	1863200	to ensure that he does not go back to office because that would just be... First, he could go to jail before all that happens.
1863200	1865081	Let's fucking hope.
1865081	1870505	But unfortunately, accountability is not a great theme in this country.
1870505	1871726	But that's a whole other podcast.
1871726	1876009	Is it wrong that I feel dirty saying his name?
1876009	1877690	I don't want to say it because it makes me feel dirty.
1877690	1879771	No, let's talk about something that makes us feel awesome.
1879771	1882073	Let's go to the next question.
1882073	1886596	And that question is, do you ever miss DDR?
1887596	1893261	And why do you think the show doesn't talk as much about it?
1893261	1898186	Do you ever miss DDR and why do you think the show doesn't talk as much about it?
1898186	1900928	DDR is moved like past us.
1900928	1910897	I mean, I hate to say, I mean, I could probably do DDR now that I'm doing ballet and my endurance is built back up.
1910897	1911157	But
1914335	1916137	I don't even know how to answer that.
1916137	1923466	I guess I could say I miss DDR, but I could also go visit DDR when I want to.
1923466	1925148	I just don't want to.
1925148	1928231	I mean, I don't know.
1928231	1931114	I mean, sometimes I think about about playing.
1931114	1931575	You know what I mean?
1932199	1939783	I think about wanting to go play and then I think about all the other stuff that I have to play.
1939783	1945566	And it also doesn't have the same magic it used to when it was new and novel.
1945566	1947667	When it was everything.
1947667	1952289	When you were almost on the edge of this phenomenon.
1952289	1953810	You were on the edge of this phenomenon.
1953810	1957092	When we started playing, we really were.
1957092	1959573	And now it's just like...
1961321	1963263	They've changed factors on the gameplay.
1963263	1967988	I still, to this day, hate the hold steps.
1967988	1969129	It's super polished and then...
1974013	1982737	Like, I'm also really pissed off at how Konami has treated the American community.
1982737	1990941	But I have to say I'm glad that the tourney circuit and all that is still going.
1990941	1996484	I don't think it's past its prime, but I think
1997984	1998384	I mean...
2020706	2025390	I just have to get off my lazy butt and go clean off the dance pads that are at my garage.
2025390	2034858	Because, I mean, I have a machine out there, just, you know, my lazy butt doesn't go out there to play because our garage is full of trash right now.
2039477	2057635	After work, I'm exhausted mentally, and then to spend time exhausting myself physically, then I don't have that creative energy to work on Minecraft content, which I'm trying to use to escape the hellhole that is my day job.
2058095	2063158	So you know, it's like, it's priorities and like, levels and stuff like that that try to do that.
2063158	2067400	But yes, I do think about it every time I go out to the garage to do laundry.
2067400	2070522	I'm like, I really need to play this thing.
2070522	2076805	Because my, my StepMania computer that was in there already broke, but I still have the 573 in there.
2076805	2079067	So I have Extreme, I could put on
2080148	2081949	a few other games in there.
2081949	2087374	I have like a multi-disc that can sort of work for some of them.
2087374	2089275	And yeah, I do still have fun playing it.
2089275	2093418	And I would like to get back into it because unfortunately COVID made me fat.
2093418	2096821	And so I would like to not be fat anymore.
2096821	2098342	Thank you very much.
2098342	2101184	And DDR did that for me, that and walking three miles a day.
2101184	2106368	But like, I would love to get back to being able to do that again.
2107529	2110592	But yeah, it does get harder as I get older for sure.
2110592	2114356	But it's only as far away as my garage.
2114356	2117439	So all right.
2117439	2125127	I'm also gonna throw this in there that I think it would be fun that when I if I make it on point that I try to play DDR on point.
2126805	2130769	My take on the question, do I miss DDR?
2130769	2132190	Yeah, I do.
2132190	2136394	But why do you think the show doesn't talk as much about it?
2136394	2138636	Probably because Step Maniacs is a better game.
2140046	2142448	It is honestly like good night.
2142448	2144389	I don't like how it's five panel.
2144389	2148952	I it's just it that's just it's too hard for me to play that.
2148952	2150573	But I do like all the songs in it.
2150573	2152234	I like I really like all the songs.
2152234	2166823	It is essentially what I've always wanted a sequel to extreme to be which was, um, hey, let's take what we did back in extreme and that type of stuff and just keep doing that before forever before the hate mail starts coming in.
2166823	2167164	I'm just
2167964	2170265	I just wanted to say an answer that would create drama.
2170265	2171045	Okay, here's the thing.
2171045	2172685	Here's the thing.
2172685	2176666	In reality, of course, I miss the DDR community.
2176666	2184968	I miss our Wednesday nights getting together and the, you know, having the food afterwards and, and all of that stuff.
2184968	2187069	I, of course, I miss all of that.
2187069	2188529	I miss that community.
2188529	2193091	I think, you know, leaning into why does the show not talk as much about it?
2193091	2194351	It's blame Konami.
2195051	2218161	Konami didn't risk DDR in this country for so long and didn't invest in the music games the way that other companies eventually did and found success with, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, and so on, that there was a gap in DDR for so long that caused us to find other stuff to play and kind of rediscover, like the community focus sort of shifted.
2218661	2225565	Now, I understand a lot of that is back now and round one has been instrumental in bringing a lot of that back to the forefront.
2225565	2237031	But I think because our lives and our hobbies have changed, because Konami gave us too big of a break, I think other people have been able to find that space, you know, again, but for me, it's like,
2237831	2239933	I, I'm out of shape.
2239933	2240254	I don't know.
2240254	2250744	But I can't resist when I see a DDR machine in the wild, especially not so much round one, when I see a DDR machine, like lonely and neglected at a bowling alley.
2250744	2256750	I can't help but sneak on there and just say, I'm gonna play a trick level song just for fun.
2256750	2258232	Yeah, it's okay.
2258232	2259273	It's okay, big guy.
2259273	2260234	People still love you.
2261069	2271153	And it's also hard for like, for me to like, especially modern DVR, I once again, I'm from the the school of like, songs go up to 10.
2271153	2272694	And that's it and difficulty.
2272694	2275535	I can't do the math now with how they have songs.
2275535	2275976	That's right.
2275976	2278277	I can't convert to the like, I can't convert.
2279677	2284620	It just, it doesn't, like, I don't know what the difficulty of songs are anymore.
2284620	2287022	And so it's, that is a little bit of a challenge.
2287022	2290143	Also, my brain still thinks I can do DDR.
2290143	2291224	My body can't.
2291224	2293165	Like, it's like, oh yeah, I could do that.
2293165	2295587	I could, I can play that, those doubles.
2295587	2296687	You know, that's, that's fine.
2296687	2300189	And then my body's like, no, no, you can't.
2300189	2300670	Yeah.
2300670	2307854	Before I started ballet, I, I, there was no way I could do anything harder than maybe five or six.
2310260	2311661	Alright, bye bye 1.5.
2311661	2312542	Okay, good.
2312542	2314663	I will keep that as in mind.
2314663	2325051	What also became difficult, Orange, right, with that is like, when I download songs, you know, off of the internet for my Step Media machine, it's like, was this used in the old format or the new format?
2325051	2328973	Like, is this, is this ain't gonna be easy?
2328973	2330675	Or is this gonna be pretty hard?
2331718	2335801	But anyway, yeah, but also in all seriousness, super props to Step Maniacs.
2335801	2339364	I see multiple people in chat kind of talking about, oh, all the cool things it does.
2339364	2349252	I think really Step Maniacs kind of took the love of the game and really, you know, innovated on that concept for, you know, the modern day dance game fan.
2349252	2350392	I think they've done a lot of great things.
2350392	2351033	I really do.
2351033	2352134	So congratulations.
2352134	2356277	And I'm very sorry for the things we said about In the Groove in the past.
2356277	2358459	It's water under the bridge, I hope at this point.
2358459	2358659	Yeah.
2359159	2361400	And at the very least... Let me put it this way.
2361400	2362381	I get it now.
2362381	2363581	I get it now.
2363581	2377948	At the very least, I would hope that if anything, if Konami was serious about their dance games, that they would at least take the opportunity to look at Step Maniacs and go, okay, we need to be better now than that to, you know, survive in this industry.
2377948	2381270	But it's Konami and, you know, they're not.
2381270	2385692	I do wish our round window would get a Dance Rush stardom, because I do want to play that.
2385692	2386713	It looks freaking awesome.
2387332	2388953	Alright, let's get to the next question.
2388953	2396917	The next question is, what job would you want if you ever worked in the gaming industry?
2396917	2399538	Loki, what job would you want if you ever worked in the gaming industry?
2399538	2402920	I've worked in the gaming industry, so like I've had lots of jobs.
2402920	2406942	I've sold games and I've, you know, I've made games.
2410442	2413285	I guess making games would still be fun.
2413285	2415227	Like, I would like to do that more.
2415227	2422196	I just don't have the time for it, and certainly, you know, mental capacity for that sometimes.
2422196	2426280	I do like to think, though, at least, you know, coding games and whatnot,
2427882	2446324	It's helped me to be able to like break, you know, part certain things, especially like, for example, in Minecraft, you're doing redstone, you know, you kind of structure stuff like you would in games, you have, you take your your thing that you're trying to accomplish, break it out into components, and then figure out how to code each of those components.
2447044	2448366	and put them all together.
2448366	2455053	And then you can also, you know, for example, take things that you've made before, take pieces of it and rearrange them and do all that.
2455053	2465565	And a lot of that stuff is kind of with game design, like when you're, you know, creating games and you've had systems and stuff that you build for other things, you can repurpose those things and, you know, do that.
2466306	2479953	Yeah, I would still like to, you know, for example, like, work on something for the Playdate that I bought, and that was my excuse for buying it, you know, certainly not to just have one.
2479953	2481794	But, you know, I'd like to try that.
2481794	2488157	There's the Game Boy, Game Boy Advanced system to, like, build stuff that
2488877	2489297	Nest Maker
2510287	2515151	Can you tell me how to do this correctly so that it works the way I wanted it to?
2515151	2519874	Like, some of the random movement stuff wasn't working right.
2519874	2525879	It would be nice to just be able to have a better understanding with that, because there's still, like, lots of stuff being made with Nest Maker.
2525879	2531803	They just put out their official strategy guide, which my game is also inside of, which I thought was pretty cool.
2531803	2533144	I forgot I even bought that.
2533144	2533545	Amazing.
2534774	2536275	Um, so there's that.
2536275	2536595	Yeah.
2536595	2546401	So there's, yeah, lots of opportunity, even like going to Unity or Godot or something like that, um, would be, I would, I mean, yeah, it would be a lot of fun to do that.
2546401	2554385	But once again, developing a game takes a lot of time and that's time that I don't have amongst the other things that I want to do.
2554385	2558588	So yeah, probably not going to happen right now.
2559572	2564795	Um, for me, well, my my Siri, actually, it is a serious answer.
2564795	2565676	It's not a joke answer.
2565676	2567837	I would want to host a revival of Starcade.
2567837	2568577	That is the job.
2568577	2571459	I want to be a fucking game show host.
2571459	2574361	I want to host a game show about video games, a revival of Nick arcade.
2574361	2575621	I'll take that too.
2575621	2586848	That would be my absolute dream job to be honest, on a somewhat like, you know, serious, what is achievable note, I would still you know, in my day job, my day world, I work with a
2588028	2589709	learning in a corporate environment.
2589709	2593251	So like training and development, corporate learning type of stuff is what I do.
2593251	2599133	I don't talk a lot about my day job for and for good reason, because there's a very clear line between those things.
2599133	2602895	But and I've told this story on the show before, so it's not a huge surprise.
2602895	2606897	I would say it was right when Alan first moved here.
2608018	2612122	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2630871	2637281	Like with Alan just having moved here, I think making that move, I don't think would have been the right call at that time.
2637281	2640606	Assuming I even got it, which you know, I hadn't been offered the job.
2640606	2644692	I pulled myself from contention after the first, I think there might have been two interviews.
2646454	2670988	and Bobby Blackwell says you also probably wouldn't still be there now and that is also a very stability is really fucking nice but I think my serious answer is I would I would have to I think do what is my other passion during my nine to five which is adult learning and that that whole environment I think I would want to take that into the gaming industry but that is a very very specialized thing but important
2674093	2680319	It used to be my dream to do music design, you know, back in the day.
2680319	2692271	And now, this is now going to be a serious answer with my current skill set, with my background in design, but also my more recent experience in project management.
2693012	2702917	is it I really do think I would love to do some sort of project management for like coordinated efforts like maybe for hashing out, you know,
2705114	2710976	a new game, I guess, you know, be the coordinator between, you know, with deliverables.
2710976	2717117	And although I still would love to to be a writer, you know, I haven't given up on that either.
2717117	2722918	I'm writing a book right now that I've been writing the same book for the last three years.
2722918	2725559	But I digress.
2725559	2728100	Coming up with ideas and integrating them
2730200	2739908	I don't know, like, doing project management with a side of, like, writing continuity, does that make sense?
2739908	2740389	No, it does.
2741283	2752428	like bringing the parts together, making things work, making sure that the deliverables, I don't want to be responsible for people, but I would love to be the one that helps bring the project together.
2752428	2755409	I think that that sounds super fun to me.
2755409	2765334	Um, and I've also looked into like community management positions to like, um, the, uh, Pokemon company was hiring for a hot minute.
2765334	2766474	I was really tempted.
2766474	2767795	It's right now.
2767795	2770836	I don't think it's the right time given the present environment.
2772017	2786068	But I mean, there's also aspects of gaming within the place that I work at that I can't bring up on the podcast that I would love to be involved with, but that's probably not going to happen.
2787406	2789867	Alright, we got two questions left.
2789867	2793489	That's assuming y'all in chat don't throw something else at us here in the next few minutes.
2793489	2796371	But we do want to get we actually do have gaming news to talk about tonight and so forth.
2796371	2797752	So we'll get to that.
2797752	2799512	But we have two questions left.
2799512	2802214	Here's here's the next last question.
2802214	2803415	What's the plan for Episode 2000?
2803415	2807477	Hopefully still be alive Jesus.
2809321	2811322	Okay, so let's do the math.
2811322	2814303	Another another Liza Minnelli reference tonight.
2814303	2821506	Well, being alive would be the plan.
2821506	2825428	I'm just doing the math on this.
2825428	2832150	I would be I don't even want to think about being that old.
2832150	2837232	I'd be 67 if it's if it takes another 22 years to get there, which assuming I'd be 67 I'd be 70.
2840948	2844869	I don't know that I want to actually be 70.
2844869	2856932	I mean, maybe by then, you know, I'll have all my bionic limbs and, you know, and I agree with DarkTetsuya, 2046 if we survive the Snatcher invasion.
2856932	2858732	But, you know, I don't I don't know.
2858732	2866794	I'm probably going to be, you know, at least 50 percent bionic parts and can actually play DDR then.
2866794	2868735	Yeah.
2868735	2870435	I. I don't.
2872325	2878430	I don't know that that's going to logically be possible.
2878430	2887038	I mean, we'll be the oldest gaming podcast for long retired people.
2887038	2894465	We'll be in our nursing home going, I'm playing my DDRs right now with my controller.
2894465	2895606	What was I playing?
2899571	2906374	Dead by Daylight, Minecraft, HowFastIs14, again.
2906374	2907975	I don't know.
2907975	2914938	It would just be like, I can't, I can't, I can barely picture my own birthday next week.
2914938	2920640	So right now, I'm just like, thank you.
2920640	2921340	I have goals.
2921340	2922641	Do you have a subathon you want to plug?
2924187	2930112	Yes, on Friday, April 19th, starting at 11 o'clock a.m.
2930112	2933415	Pacific Time until maybe past 11 p.m.
2933415	2934797	Pacific Time.
2934797	2937719	I am doing a subathon.
2937719	2939221	Subbing isn't necessary.
2939221	2941563	I really just want people to hang out with me.
2941563	2943585	But if you want to give me a present, a sub works.
2944626	2948969	Now that I play Dead by Daylight again, I'm gonna really try to come and play some games.
2948969	2956515	Yeah, I'm gonna have open lobbies, and I may do, like, an avatar palette cleanser.
2956515	2964661	But for the most part, I'm even planning on being on cam, so I have redeems that mean I have to do pliés and élivés.
2970989	2974772	I ran into a lady at Daiso who was just a little bit older than me.
2974772	2979596	And we were talking about like how it was us that went out and played video games and everything.
2979596	2982078	And she's like, Oh, now I'm into gardening.
2982078	2982658	And I'm like,
2987376	3001719	I paid, had it not been for certain things, what would have been $3,000 for a computer just to play my video games online and show people and talk to them and scream at the game.
3001719	3006240	So, yeah.
3006240	3011702	And I don't feel like any mentally older.
3011702	3016523	I feel like I give less of a shit about some things.
3019170	3025479	And I'm thinking back to doing OLR.
3025479	3031426	OLR was what got me streaming in the first place, and then I had that period where I was bullied a bit.
3031426	3034250	And then I came back, and it's through
3035391	3042633	the show actually introducing me to what Dead by Daylight actually is to play and me deciding I'm going to start from noob.
3042633	3043033	You're welcome.
3043033	3043833	Thank you.
3043833	3044514	You're welcome.
3044514	3044754	Hey, you.
3044754	3046554	I'm going to start from absolute noob and stream my progress in this damn game.
3046554	3047154	And I was a Legion main.
3047154	3063819	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie
3066115	3067316	Okay.
3067316	3071638	For those that don't understand, I'm the one that said, Jamie, you should try this game.
3071638	3073599	I think you'd enjoy it.
3073599	3076600	I looked at trailers before and I was like, I don't know.
3076600	3080562	This will make me, this will make me, I'll be mad.
3080562	3081983	I don't like first person.
3081983	3084164	I don't want to be a survivor because I don't want to die.
3084164	3090467	And then I'm like, I played killer for three years and then added survivor.
3090467	3091367	All right.
3091367	3092708	Uh, I got one more answer for this.
3092708	3094789	And now I've got stuff.
3095219	3097480	What's the plan for episode 2000?
3097480	3102524	It will probably be completely generated by AI, the way things are going.
3102524	3115011	Not that I authorize that, but I feel like at that point, if I can even speak at that point, it will probably be something that is completely AI generated at that point.
3115011	3118974	Hey ChatGBT, generate what an episode 2000 of OLR might look like.
3120049	3124413	Did you hear that TLC had a completely AI-generated romance flick?
3124413	3125715	Oh wow, no.
3125715	3127016	And it is as bad as it is.
3127016	3129899	Oh god, it's so bad.
3129899	3137366	They have a trailer, and they put stuff in the trailer, and they're like, yeah, that's good, and it's not, it's not.
3137366	3139668	Makes the room look like a cinematic masterpiece.
3139668	3140008	TCL.
3140008	3140889	TCL.
3140889	3142731	Clocks don't have two threes on them.
3142731	3143492	You mean it's not Rob?
3144915	3147498	Well, in a way, it is a little bit.
3147498	3151202	Okay, there is one final question.
3151202	3152423	And this is a whopper.
3152423	3153384	This is a deep question.
3153384	3153824	You ready?
3153824	3154825	Here we go.
3154825	3156507	Last question.
3156507	3161752	When written about in the history books, what do you want people to remember about OLR?
3167083	3170365	A callback from an episode three weeks ago or so.
3170365	3173707	I want them to remember that we were woke and gay.
3173707	3174928	Good night!
3174928	3181373	Woke and gay.
3181373	3185656	I want... And that we never sold out!
3185656	3188277	Go ahead.
3188277	3189618	No, woke and gay is cool.
3189618	3190559	I'm fine with woke and gay.
3192839	3196802	I don't know.
3196802	3203428	I would just be happy that they remembered us at all.
3203428	3204529	It's kind of sad.
3204529	3207932	They'll remember us.
3207932	3211315	All 40 people watching right now.
3211315	3214518	I would like to be remembered as a show that really
3216516	3220261	I believe we were the first show period to take phone calls live on Skype.
3232395	3233636	I really believe that.
3233636	3234896	But I don't have the proof.
3234896	3237297	So it's a hard thing to claim.
3237297	3239858	But I love that we did that for as long as we did.
3239858	3241679	And I think that was a lot.
3241679	3245641	It's a bummer Microsoft like literally has killed Skype in favor of teams at this point.
3245641	3247201	And so we've had to shift as well.
3247201	3250883	And I don't think we generate as many calls this way.
3250883	3251503	I get that.
3251503	3253964	But I think taking calls over Skype was really cool.
3253964	3258266	And having the live chat was also great.
3258266	3260107	I love that we have been able to
3261167	3263950	you know, obviously the three of us do an awful lot for the show.
3263950	3268435	And you know, our personality is all over the show.
3268435	3274882	But it's really all of you that, that oftentimes make this car go in a completely different direction.
3274882	3276965	So I would want to re remember- You're all a part of this.
3277185	3285928	Yeah, I would want to be remembered that we were really one of the first shows to really go the extra mile to incorporate the audience as well.
3285928	3288609	And yes, PodCulture says y'all birthed other shows too.
3288609	3291750	That's, that's probably the ultimate compliment, to be quite honest.
3291750	3295651	You know, the probably the best possible compliment somebody can say is,
3296631	3301414	I started podcasting because your guys' show was so terrible, I knew I could do better.
3301414	3304636	No, but you know what I mean?
3304636	3308998	You guys, you know, I wanted to do what you all were doing.
3308998	3313381	And so that's, yeah, very humbling and really great.
3313381	3320845	And I think going back, throwback to the last question, I think this show lives on through the other shows that it birthed.
3321883	3333321	much like we are carrying out in a weird way under station live and everything we learned from that you know so yeah anyway uh that's it everybody answered that i think
3334943	3338604	Well, thank you all for indulging us there a little bit.
3338604	3345287	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says people can remember the OLR prove that just because you're old doesn't mean you can't like the new stuff, too.
3345287	3345687	That's right.
3345687	3346348	We are hip.
3346348	3347888	Hello, fellow kids.
3347888	3349769	That is right.
3349769	3352550	YYR says, didn't all those other shows end already?
3352550	3353430	LOL.
3353430	3355031	Probably.
3355031	3355771	It depends.
3355771	3358092	Well, if you're talking about like Horde House and things like that, yes.
3358092	3359493	But like, I think
3360509	3364070	Ranma has credited for Anime Jam Session, which is still going.
3364070	3367292	And I think there's other shows too that maybe haven't said it as explicitly.
3367292	3370253	Um, so it's, yeah.
3370253	3378416	And there's still other things in the works, you know, I've got a couple of projects that are floating around until I get other projects done.
3378416	3379917	So.
3379917	3382398	I want to hear a scary fact.
3382398	3385059	If we go for another 20 years, you never know.
3385059	3389541	There could be people that aren't born yet that start podcasts that are based off of our show.
3391894	3393515	Isn't that scary?
3393515	3403722	Honestly, I think that we actually do have listeners who were born during the time frame that our show has existed.
3403722	3406183	I hate thinking about that.
3406183	3407564	Yeah, me too.
3407564	3410926	Well, yeah.
3410926	3411767	Yeah, there we go.
3411767	3412587	There we go.
3412587	3417310	Cosmos Eve in chat says your show is literally older than me.
3417310	3417871	Thank you.
3419124	3421268	Thank you everybody, we're off to die.
3421268	3421669	Good night.
3428220	3449347	But you know, okay, I'm going to step back for something real too, though, is that doing this show and keep up doing this show has been what's given me some of the confidence to go out and do other big things in my life, like going back to streaming, doing fucking ballet in my 40s, you know?
3449347	3453528	I have a goal that when I'm 50, I want to be on point.
3453528	3453668	And
3454679	3460242	I would have never had a goal like that if I hadn't had the big confidence booster that doing this show has.
3460242	3473710	And the show has actually helped me get over a lot of personal hang-ups and reiterate that what other people think of you is not my business.
3473710	3477092	And if they try to make it my business, fuck them.
3477092	3478412	And I'm meaning like the negative stuff.
3478412	3480073	You can keep giving me compliments.
3480073	3480934	I thrive on that shit.
3481738	3491203	As much as we joke about that nobody listens to this show, I do think there have been several opportunities that have been created because of this show.
3491203	3494545	Like we got to go to E3 and it's prime because of this show.
3494545	3500288	We got to, you know, hang out there and be on the breaking news front lines of that and live that life.
3500288	3502549	And that was an opportunity because of this show.
3502549	3504430	I got to play Supernova.
3504430	3506011	We met Yamaoka.
3506011	3506792	Yes.
3506792	3507332	Naoki.
3507332	3508152	We met.
3508152	3510794	I literally have run into twice Kojima.
3513407	3515970	I got to meet Kondo-san, Koji Kondo.
3523186	3533032	being in video games now, being a part of the art that we, you know, even like with a brief cameo, being a part of the art that we so love and talk about every week.
3533032	3535914	And I'm talking about specifically two instances come to mind.
3535914	3538135	There's been more, but these two will always come to mind.
3538135	3543078	And the first one is Bungie ferret tossing, which our very own YYR did on Xbox 360.
3544279	3550966	which unfortunately is no longer available because they sunset the XNA or whatever it was, that indie game thing.
3550966	3554430	But you know how fucking cool that was to fire it up on my Xbox 360?
3554430	3559015	I mean, we did have the gamer pics, which was also cool, and the OLR logo was up there.
3562538	3563579	right off the bat.
3563579	3565300	The Typing of the Dead was more of a mod.
3565300	3567501	It's not like Sega themselves put us in the game, you know?
3567501	3568582	Oh, that's fun stuff.
3568582	3569642	No, it is fun.
3569642	3572844	I would say, and YYR says, Bungie ferret tossing will be back.
3572844	3574085	I personally guarantee this.
3574085	3574465	Thank you.
3574465	3577427	And you've always been lovely with making the OLR dream games a reality.
3577427	3582449	And I would say from one end of the pendulum to the other, so you got the indie game, right?
3582449	3583070	I would say
3584366	3588011	when we showed up in that Namco collection on PlayStation 3.
3588011	3591575	And there's a very, there's a very subtle blink and you miss it.
3591575	3597343	But if you fire up the Namco collection on PlayStation 3, thank you, Namco Museum Essentials, that was the name of the game.
3597343	3599866	If you fire it up on PlayStation 3, there's a splash screen
3600286	3602027	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3622094	3626999	Um, yeah, TutorialSkree actually had our host names in there.
3626999	3629661	And that was, yeah, me, I don't remember.
3629661	3631983	Yeah, Tinkle, maybe, I don't know, something, it was something.
3631983	3639510	But obviously, that was somebody on the inside, showing that they were listening to this show.
3639510	3643753	And that was, that was an incredible feeling, especially because the fact, especially for what it was,
3644514	3648176	And again, why I cite this one because there's been other little random cameo appearances too.
3648176	3663042	But the reason why I cite this one specifically is because the fact that this was like alongside literal Namco classics that I grew up on, that we are able to share that space with fucking Pac-Man.
3663042	3665163	And I don't even know, Dragon Spirit was in that collection.
3665163	3665943	I know it was a big one.
3665943	3672826	These really like, Dig Dug, I think it was another big one in that one, that we were sharing the space with that just felt like
3673766	3675407	Wow.
3675407	3677287	Yeah, did it kids.
3677287	3677987	We did it.
3677987	3679088	That was that was it.
3679088	3679828	Anyway, Loki, I'm sorry.
3679828	3680768	I went for like five minutes.
3680768	3683209	You were trying to say something earlier if you even remember.
3683209	3684149	I don't remember now.
3684149	3685630	Sorry.
3685630	3686090	No.
3686090	3686570	Oh, wait.
3686570	3687730	Oh, I remember now.
3687730	3690751	It was, you know, just yeah, doing the podcast this long.
3690751	3693792	It's made me very comfortable in other podcasts.
3693792	3696793	Like I could just like anything.
3696793	3697713	No stress whatsoever.
3697713	3701074	I've been doing this for as long as I can remember.
3701074	3702755	So I don't know.
3702755	3702955	Yeah.
3703900	3705361	For sure, for sure.
3705361	3706522	Um, okay.
3706522	3710664	So thank you for indulging us on our kickoff topic tonight, which was all about us.
3710664	3711985	We're going to get into other stuff.
3711985	3718029	But first, as we always do, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
3718029	3720131	DarkSakura, I will start with you as usual.
3720131	3720711	How was your game week?
3722699	3725640	I played my usuals pretty much.
3725640	3733763	I played more Dracula XX, Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known as Symphony of the Night.
3733763	3735624	I played Dead by Daylight.
3735624	3736765	Actually, no, I take that back.
3736765	3737105	No, I did...
3737865	3746791	I played Dead by Daylight, I think, after the show last week, but I didn't play on Tuesday because I've been getting a breast sinus infection and I had a really bad headache.
3746791	3748272	I just couldn't play.
3748272	3755477	And I've played more Avatar, which I've beaten, but I'm going back and trying to get all the side quests done.
3755477	3756518	I love that game.
3756518	3761141	I love the just the freedom and doing like
3761981	3773993	Little tiny things in that game, and I'm really hoping that there's more DLC that comes out that deals with some of the sort of suspended storylines, I reckon, with some characters who just walked off.
3773993	3777517	Where are they now?
3777517	3780460	But that's been the big thing, you know.
3782429	3783330	My usual.
3783330	3786916	It's been it's been a very busy week as well because I'm in training at work.
3786916	3795829	So being in training and being sick means I just play what I can vegetate to.
3795829	3796089	Loki.
3798055	3813149	Well, this week I played the game that's behind me, which is Turbo Kid, and it's an excellent Metroidvania game, highly worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of the movie like I am, and I've made people watch it, and I will continue to make people watch the movie.
3813149	3814551	It is great, you should check it out.
3816232	3818753	But yeah, the game itself is also very good.
3818753	3826935	Just the whole gameplay, the animation to it, the story, they have all the music that's, I think, from the movie too.
3826935	3828375	It's just really good.
3828375	3833736	And I like that it continues the story from the movie, which is a lot of fun.
3833736	3835257	So you can check that out.
3835257	3838157	They also have what they call a non-canon playthrough.
3838157	3841298	You can play as Apple as well, which I thought was interesting.
3841298	3844419	I guess it'd be non-canon because she's dead.
3844419	3844799	Spoiler.
3845379	3846041	Fallout 4
3852386	3858390	But instead I modded Fallout 4 for like 8 hours yesterday and still haven't played it yet.
3858390	3860351	But I intend to play Fallout 4 at some point.
3860351	3867876	And the reason I wanted to play Fallout 4 is because I binge watched the entire Fallout TV series, which is excellent in my opinion.
3867876	3871738	I am not a huge Fallout nut as far as the lore goes.
3871738	3874720	I am, I guess, a casual enjoyer of Fallout.
3874720	3880703	So I wasn't bent out of shape about New Vegas stuff and, you know, canon and this and that.
3881824	3883305	It's good for what it is.
3883305	3891773	Like, the show is really enjoyable, and I liked the characters in it, and I'm very excited for the next season, so hopefully that'll be coming very soon.
3891773	3897037	I imagine that this is highly successful because all the reviews have been great on it.
3897037	3899619	So, yeah, looking forward to that.
3899619	3904203	And then, of course, Minecraft's been playing, you know, a lot of that.
3904203	3909208	I've been working, trying to work mostly on my theme park ride, and so,
3910814	3914076	Struggling to get everything done with that.
3914076	3939052	I Put together the redstone for the scoring system in it, which was complicated so that's at least all set up now and I've been trying to go through and actually do the Detail decorating on everything and because I had before that I what I'm calling wool boxing and that's essentially just great boxes dividing up the show building if you will
3940433	3942635	Thanks for watching!
3956824	3986304	I have it now where 14 boats can be going at the same time and the game is actually going to keep track of 14 different scores at the same time using redstone magic and scoreboards in the game and so it was complicated to get that all working but now it does in theory and so yeah it's just trying to work through that it's just taking a very long time and I really need to get past this like
3987404	3990825	You know, everything needs to be done before I can put it in an episode.
3990825	3999347	Because next season, when I work on the next project, which is going to be even bigger than this, it cannot be in one episode because of the nature of how it's going to go.
3999347	4007690	So I'm going to look to kind of how Tango did his decked-outs 2 from last season of Hermitcraft.
4009059	4020491	Yeah, just trying to trying to get that so that, you know, people start looking at my channel a little bit more because the growth is super slow and it's getting frustrating.
4020491	4022033	But.
4022033	4024295	How it always is.
4024295	4026697	It's got to keep at it, keep at it because you love it.
4027769	4029631	Um, let's see my game a week.
4029631	4032534	Um, I was pretty busy in my day life.
4032534	4034656	So I didn't have as much time for games.
4034656	4037538	But I did still play plenty of Final Fantasy 14.
4037538	4038740	That's my go to.
4038740	4042063	I'm trying to get all my jobs to 90 before Dawn Trail comes out.
4042063	4043304	The benchmark came out today.
4043544	4044004	Sable, I love her.
4064804	4067286	also known as Michaela's girlfriend.
4067286	4080055	And yeah, I've been I've been having fun playing as Cheryl even though I think I've maybe won one of the like 10 games I've played because I don't know if my skill regressed or what or I'm just using a very bad build.
4080055	4088821	Or I just playing with pugs all the time is very soul draining because people just don't come to get you off hook.
4088821	4090062	They just don't care.
4090062	4092163	So it's very boring.
4092163	4093304	Anyway, um,
4093864	4106896	Otherwise, I still have been playing, to be fair, I do play the GPS games, you know, the Ingress, the Pokemon Go, quite a bit, quite a bit of Monster Hunter now, actually, still been doing that, trying to level up my gear and all that good stuff.
4106896	4110099	So yeah, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
4110099	4114362	Not a lot of new stuff, but hopefully that'll change in the coming weeks.
4114362	4114603	All right.
4115666	4118047	Are we going to do news on our 1000th episode?
4118047	4118867	Yes, we are.
4118867	4119808	We're going to get right back into it.
4119808	4120128	Why?
4120128	4123989	Why wouldn't we do the thing we always do here at Orange Launch Radio?
4123989	4124570	Yes.
4124570	4126430	Get into some news.
4126430	4132033	So also, I got the screenshot and I'm linking it like in the chat room of us in the Namco Museum.
4132953	4135315	Oh, somebody sent you this screenshot or?
4135315	4138717	No, I found a YouTube video and screenshotted it.
4138717	4139657	Oh, there's a YouTube.
4139657	4141078	Oh, that's all.
4141078	4142299	I wouldn't have even thought of that.
4142299	4145381	A long play out there or something that shows that, huh?
4145381	4147802	Oh, how funny.
4147802	4150004	Well, actually, I'm looking through my Blue Sky account.
4150004	4152746	I can I can't even do that better.
4152746	4155808	What I can do is just go thanks to the magic of Internet.
4155808	4156688	There it is.
4156688	4158229	So there's the screenshot.
4158229	4158489	Yeah.
4158489	4159110	And you can see.
4159850	4166973	Sky DarkSakura, Loki, Tinker is what they but I'm almost positive that's supposed to be like a washed version of tingle.
4166973	4169734	And then I Dragon Spirit I noticed over here.
4169734	4170654	Look at that.
4170654	4171694	Oh, LR.
4171694	4173695	Oh, LR.
4173695	4176336	So anyway, cool.
4176336	4177276	That's funny.
4177276	4179337	Oh, how did that get in there?
4179337	4180817	Interesting.
4180817	4181438	Okay.
4181438	4186860	Anyway, let's move on and talk about our news.
4186860	4187780	So let's get into
4189827	4190637	This First Story, Loki.
4191772	4207084	Yeah, so we talked about a while ago that, you know, Blizzard wasn't going to be able to publish their games in China anymore because of a disagreement with, I think it was actually NetEase at the time, but now they're back.
4207084	4208545	They're back together.
4208545	4218833	So Blizzard Entertainment put out a tweet that announced that we are pleased to announce that a new agreement with NetEase to bring Blizzard games back to mainland China has been made.
4218833	4221215	And so thank you for your patience and support.
4222270	4228024	So that's pretty awesome that they'll get to play their World of Warcraft stuff.
4230834	4237995	Even though I think a lot of that ends up being modified, like, you know, there's, uh, it's not really undead because of the things they can and can't show.
4237995	4244557	But, um, yeah, no, I, I know the folks over there are probably thrilled to have the games coming back.
4244557	4248378	Well, and I also wonder how much resentment there might be for them leaving in the first place.
4248378	4249958	You know, people that are just like, fuck it.
4249958	4250678	I'm not going back.
4250678	4253179	Cause you know, fuck them forever leaving in the first place.
4253179	4255099	I imagine there's probably going to be a little bit of that as well.
4255099	4257019	Right.
4257019	4257459	Yeah.
4257459	4257700	Yeah.
4257700	4258740	I mean, I don't know.
4258740	4259860	It's, it,
4260799	4262641	I'm sure it's all like money.
4262641	4265685	That's why there was a, probably a disagreement in the first place.
4265685	4273234	And now that, you know, Blizzard's owned by Microsoft, I'm sure that they had some different amounts of money to throw around.
4275379	4276420	All right.
4276420	4287570	Well, this week was the closure of the Wii Online services for, excuse me, Nintendo Online services for the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS.
4287570	4297980	And just as soon as those servers went down, the very next day, folks are finding ways to be able to play online multiplayer games again, like Splatoon and so forth.
4297980	4299782	It is a service called Pretendo.
4300642	4305745	a fan collective that they what they used to do was custom Wii U servers.
4305745	4312009	But now Pretendo is opening their servers to everybody and all you have to do is do a DNS change.
4312009	4314490	So I think this was very smart what they did.
4314490	4318593	They didn't say anything about how they were going to do this until Nintendo pulled the plug.
4318593	4324917	And essentially, because I would assume they also can't really do firmware updates at this point now because they pulled all that well,
4325717	4327338	The Pokemon stuff is still running.
4327338	4328839	So there's a shell of something there.
4328839	4335543	So I maybe if Nintendo really wanted to close this loophole, they could, but they're fucking dicks if they do like let's let's be real.
4335543	4338585	So it's a DNS change that you make.
4338585	4341527	And that means you do not have to use homebrew.
4341527	4343348	You do not have to use custom firmware.
4343348	4344069	It's an exploit.
4344069	4345930	They're even calling it an exploit.
4345930	4346050	And
4347691	4359686	yeah we and they even say in a tweet we've been holding on to this exploit for this day for quite some time in case nintendo decided to issue patches for it so it's not even a case they will not even a secret
4360600	4361421	No fun.
4361421	4365603	Some services that use their own SSL libraries are not supported.
4365603	4370747	So that would mean like Watch Dogs, YouTube, because those are third party titles.
4370747	4374329	TV, I totally forgot about TV.
4374329	4376971	The eShop, Miiverse, those things will work.
4376971	4382495	But Miiverse functionality in games will work through SSSL.
4382495	4385997	So the details on how to do this if you want to play Splatoon,
4386337	4391262	Mario Kart 8 or whatever, head over to Pretendo.network.
4391262	4393624	And they haven't been cease and desisted yet.
4393624	4394605	So we'll see.
4394605	4397949	But you know, again, like Nintendo literally pulled the plug.
4397949	4400491	And I see a lot of this as game preservation.
4400491	4408619	You know, if there is no, I mean, Mario Kart 8 is one thing, but there is no way now to play the original Splatoon
4409540	4411785	online with you know, which it really is.
4411785	4415533	I mean, yeah, there's single player mode, but the online mode is a special unique thing.
4415533	4418740	There's no way to do it unless you use something like this.
4418740	4418960	Yeah.
4421139	4425320	Um, yeah, and Mike Def says this is this is how most people should do it.
4425320	4427840	Wait for a full version and shadow drop it.
4427840	4432801	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell saying Pretendo had this in their back pocket for months and just waited to announce it.
4432801	4434381	And that was the smart thing to do.
4434381	4436762	And that's especially when dealing with Nintendo.
4436762	4438122	That's how you have to do it.
4438122	4441603	You just have to just drop it and leave.
4441603	4444303	And then once it's on the internet, it's on the internet forever.
4444303	4448804	So anyway, let's move on DarkSakura.
4450516	4461953	So, I'm really not at all surprised by this, but Baldur's Gate 3 became the first game to win every major Game of the Year award.
4462921	4465924	every one of them.
4465924	4481378	It took the BAFTA, it got the Golden Joystick, the Game Award Primary, the DICE Awards, the Game Developer Choice Awards,
4483220	4499014	And I mean, it was up against, I mean, with a lot of these, especially in the BAFTAs, it was up against Alan Wake 2, Tears of the Kingdom, Spider-Man 2, and like, this is pretty crazy, and it's beaten out, it did better than Elden Ring did, and we know
4499974	4501295	Elden Ring Vampire Survivor
4518793	4521897	Bobby Blackwolf says it did not win the Bobby Blackwolf Game of the Year Awards.
4521897	4523018	This headline is misleading.
4523018	4523839	I'm sorry, Bobby.
4523839	4539436	It is major video game award awards, which I think there's five that at least Wikipedia, who I don't consider the source for everything, but I think Wikipedia will list as the like major gaming award productions that happen.
4539436	4539516	So
4540635	4548420	Yeah, um, yeah, with Elegant, yeah, it was, uh, the Baftas actually did pick, uh, Vampire Savior, Survivors, sorry.
4548420	4548981	Yeah.
4548981	4552443	Vampire Savior is Darkstalkers!
4552443	4561529	But, hey, it's, it's great, um, I haven't tried playing it since I got my, my new computer, but, um,
4563776	4564737	It's a great one.
4564737	4567919	Yeah, that's a great voice acting and in hot stuff.
4567919	4574404	It's one of those games I still need to go back and visit properly because I don't think I got it gave it a fair shot the first time through but I need to try it again.
4574404	4580569	We'll just let's throw that in the ever growing backlog of games I'll never get around to because I play MMOs.
4580569	4582130	All right, moving on Loki.
4585222	4587924	Alright, so this is kind of funny.
4587924	4594769	So there's apparently a game studio, Possibility Space, which was created by Jeff Strain.
4594769	4597350	He also created State of Decay.
4597350	4599712	He is closing down his studio because of leaks.
4606937	4619781	This had, I guess, been prompted from some questions that they received from Ethan Gatch of Kotaku, asking them about a game that they're working on.
4619781	4626243	And apparently this game was supposed to be under, of course, NDA, and as a result,
4632848	4643158	Last week I received a list of topics and questions from Ethan Gatch, a reporter of Kotaku, regarding an article he's writing about Pytania Media and the closure of Crop Circle Games.
4643158	4650004	Much of it was expected, but I was also stunned to see non-public information about Project Vognut.
4651645	4660271	Disclosure of our publishing partner with details of our business and financial relationship and details of internal P&L discussions and confidential all-company meetings.
4678393	4688961	Leaks of this nature are typically malicious and done by outside hacking, so to see internal team members under confidentiality agreements engage in this was shocking.
4688961	4696107	As a result of this cancellation of our publishing relationship and careful consideration, I am closing Possibility Space.
4696107	4699449	Today is your last day of employment at this company.
4700450	4701511	and so on and so forth.
4701511	4703352	Talk about taking your ball and going home.
4703352	4704293	Geez.
4704293	4711658	Also, yeah, I've retained a lawyer who will oversee the wind down for the studio and blah blah blah.
4711658	4711958	Yeah.
4711958	4713479	Did you hear that everyone?
4713479	4715641	I've retained a lawyer.
4715641	4718103	This will be a legal issue.
4718103	4721785	This I think is it's talking about like the wind down of the company.
4721785	4725088	I guess it's for like HR and stuff like that.
4725088	4725908	Let's see here.
4728549	4739834	Yes, given the company's own strict confidentiality and notification obligations, I immediately got on a plane for in-person meetings with our publishing partner to discuss the impact on our project.
4739834	4746798	During that discussion, our partner expressed low confidence that they would be willing to invest the additional resources needed to complete the game.
4746798	4754061	So it sounds like it's possible that maybe because these questions were being asked, maybe it
4755509	4764864	I guess unveiled some sort of like inner workings of the company and because of that the publisher got cold feet, maybe?
4764864	4765244	I don't know.
4766360	4791780	but that sucks for them but also I don't know what kind of drama what kind of drama is so much drama I'm I'm very because I'm assuming we're still going to get to find out in the coming week or so so we'll see now they have to hastily update the article to probably contact more people who are going to be even more open to squealing because this whole thing is shut down laid off yeah so
4794029	4797150	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says Kotaku hasn't shifted to writing guides yet.
4797150	4800571	Not completely, just the retail.
4800571	4802191	They have been writing lots of guides actually.
4802191	4804872	Oh no, they have, but that's not like 100% of what they do.
4804872	4807192	It's just a lot of what they do.
4807192	4816274	Yeah, like for example, if you happen to look at their site, the second thing on here is like, more Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Dragon Dogma tips.
4816274	4818035	You're welcome.
4818035	4818835	I didn't ask for this.
4819707	4834024	which interestingly enough I saw a story today about that I guess it's not in our show role but I guess folks are saying that the sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are disappointing?
4835205	4836567	And here we go again with Square Enix.
4836567	4844075	I don't know if this is somebody, I don't know if this is them saying it or if it was an investor or somebody saying it, but I guess it's only sold half of what Remake did.
4844075	4850583	But they're leaving a huge part out when they say that and that is the fact that this game isn't available on the PlayStation 4.
4851727	4861769	which everybody, you know, or many more people had a PlayStation 4 when, you know, Remake came out than has a PlayStation 5 at this point.
4861769	4864689	So I don't think you can still call that.
4864689	4866470	That's not a one for one.
4866470	4873291	I think there's definitely some bitter Bettys out there and bitter Bobs about the fact that the game is not multi-platform.
4873291	4877452	I think people want to see this on PC and, you know, Xbox and so on.
4877952	4883317	because and trying to say, oh, it's not selling as much because this is exclusive.
4883317	4887401	But Bobby says it's an analyst.
4887401	4891124	So somebody like a Michael Patcher will say, but it's funny.
4891124	4891665	I'm an analyst.
4891665	4893546	I can make predictions like this now, too.
4893546	4895708	So it's equal weight, right?
4895708	4899952	Because if I'm an analyst, then I can I can make all sorts of things here.
4899952	4901353	We put the anal and analyst.
4901353	4901854	Absolutely.
4902294	4907178	So as an analyst, I'm going to say that one thing I did notice about Kotaku recently is they've shut off comments.
4907178	4908859	So that's fun.
4908859	4910800	No commenting on articles anymore.
4910800	4913843	I mean, half the articles are tips now anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
4913843	4916385	But yeah, it's kind of fun.
4919369	4927536	Well, maybe at some point, these websites will open up tipping because don't we as Americans love to tip?
4927536	4928957	Don't we love it?
4928957	4935442	Don't we just love that everywhere you go, there's that question, how much do you want to tip this person?
4935442	4937844	I hate that, like so much.
4937844	4945710	Not that, not that, like, I don't think, like, I get like, you know, certain services should be tippable, but like when they're just like,
4946881	4956489	When you're just doing an order where there's no special handling, it's just like they're handing you the food that you paid for and stuff like that.
4956489	4963674	Or even outside of this, I've heard of services where they want you to tip for grocery stores and stuff like that.
4966277	4968360	I don't have a problem with the tipping.
4968360	4977150	What I do have a problem with is that I'm the one expected to tip when the people at the very top are making billions of dollars.
4977150	4979353	They're the ones that should be fucking tipping.
4980074	4991863	That's who should be leaving the fucking tips, should be the people that are making more money than a person could ever spend in their lifetime, CEO of McDonald's, CEO of Walmart.
4991863	4995266	That's the person that should be leaving the fucking tips.
4995266	4997288	That's what's messed up about this.
4997288	4999610	That's what it is for me.
4999610	5000750	So anyway.
5003445	5024916	A former president of Blizzard, Mike Ibarra, who of course was the president of Blizzard but is no longer there after all the Microsoft stuff went down, has made a suggestion that players should be able to tip developers after completing a game in a tweet saying, I thought about this idea for a while as a player since I've been diving into single player games lately.
5024916	5029879	When I beat a game, there are some that just leave me in awe of how amazing the experience was.
5030379	5043229	At the end of the game, I've often thought I wish I could give these folks another 10 or $20 because it was worth more than my initial $70 and they didn't try to nickel and dime me every second.
5043229	5048934	Games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring.
5048934	5053598	I know 70 is already a lot, but it's an option at the end of the game I wish I had at times.
5053598	5054719	Some games are that special.
5055595	5058396	Mike, did you really play Red Dead Redemption 2?
5058396	5061197	Did you not see Red Dead Redemption online?
5061197	5065039	Are you really saying that Rockstar needs more money from, like, tips?
5065039	5075643	Because, like, they have just... It's so money-hungry, like, as it is, and you're like, oh, I paid $70, and I really feel like that they need more.
5075643	5081806	Like, Boulder's Gate wasn't $70, I don't believe, and, like, it, you know, like...
5084581	5097813	Mike says, I know most will dislike this idea, but I realize we are tired of tipping and everything else, but I view this different from a pressure to tip type scenario many face and give feedback on.
5105700	5110062	But I think there is some things in what he's saying.
5110062	5112423	And keep in mind, he's not the president of Blizzard anymore.
5112423	5115764	And he's not saying Blizzard games, you should be able to tip the Blizzard people.
5115764	5117405	He's not really saying that.
5117405	5122947	But I do feel that like, okay, if I enjoy the game, I buy the Battle Pass.
5122947	5125488	Like Diablo 4, a Blizzard game, ironically.
5125488	5126729	I love that series.
5126729	5127870	I like Diablo 4.
5127870	5133192	I bought the Battle Pass because I liked the game, which is something that, you know, to me, that's tipping.
5133972	5140355	Um, and but I can also understand that like with indie developers, tipping and so forth is great.
5140355	5143016	Um, you know, and help can help folks make ends meet and so forth.
5143016	5147638	And some do have tip jars set up and maybe it needs to be a little more front and center.
5147638	5148859	I don't know.
5148859	5148959	Um,
5149977	5163869	But a lot of the bigger companies, like the Activision specifically, I again think the people on the front lines ought to be being tipped by that money that was given to that fucking cesspool Bobby Kotick when he left.
5163869	5165971	He got a millions dollar payout.
5165971	5171976	That should have gone to the artists, the coders, the testers, all that.
5172717	5175558	that made that game, not fucking Bobby Kotick.
5175558	5176618	He doesn't deserve a tip.
5176618	5178699	He deserves a swift boot in the ass.
5178699	5182100	That's what pisses me off about tipping culture.
5182100	5187681	Yeah, you're asking me to tip because you are raking in your pocketing the money they should be getting.
5187681	5189402	That's fucked up.
5189402	5195744	I don't understand like where he's I really don't understand where he's coming from, like with that, because where does it stop?
5195744	5198865	Like, honestly, with that, it's it's not a
5199804	5206506	It's not a service that's provided like they've gone out of their way to do something like, you know, super special for you.
5206506	5207066	It's a game.
5207066	5207927	It's a product.
5207927	5209447	You know what I'd be like saying?
5209447	5216909	I'm tipping, you know, the box of cereal that I got, you know, today because it was a box of cereal and I thoroughly enjoyed it or something like that.
5216909	5219510	Like, can you imagine if they started doing that?
5219510	5222571	Like, I know some indie games do that and that's fine.
5222571	5228113	Like they have them put in there where like, hey, you can click on this and, you know, buy me a coffee or something like that.
5228113	5228293	Like, uh,
5229153	5237516	I remember it was Orna, Orna, I was just gonna bring up Orna, the indie GPS game.
5237516	5239097	Yeah, that's a free game, though.
5239097	5239857	Exactly.
5239857	5240838	Exactly.
5240838	5245940	But he built that in you buy me a coffee for $1 a night and it was that you wouldn't get anything out of it.
5245940	5247200	Just buy me a coffee.
5247200	5251562	And I bet there's a lot of people that did that because they enjoy that game.
5252422	5254043	Right, and that's a little bit different.
5254043	5264111	You know, it's just when we're talking about a $70 game with, you know, a $30 battle pass with, you know, $60 micro... It's not even microtransactions anymore.
5264111	5266132	Cosmetics, you know.
5266132	5274878	What I just heard was that Call of Duty has a stupid King Kong, you know, glove cosmetic that's like $60 in the game.
5274878	5277740	Like, and you're still wanting more money?
5277740	5280222	Like... No.
5280222	5280923	Like, no.
5281673	5282794	Not at all.
5282794	5283815	No, thanks.
5283815	5284995	Not paying you any more money.
5284995	5290779	Drew Nami in chat says, I'm reminded of shareware, which I actually kind of get a vibe from that too.
5290779	5293821	But we're, we're a long ways from those days, right?
5293821	5297624	Like we don't sadly, you know, it's the shareware is the thing of the past.
5297624	5301606	But yeah, I do remember that like that felt like, like, I enjoyed this demo so much.
5301606	5302247	I want more.
5302247	5304508	Here's some money type of thing.
5304508	5305929	I would like to tip like,
5307339	5309521	the members of the dev team.
5309521	5316527	Yeah, I'd be more open to tip if I if I know that the CEO isn't seeing a fucking dime.
5316527	5319409	That's that's when I'd be willing to tip.
5319409	5320430	Here's how you do it.
5320430	5324634	You can you can link your your dev teams
5326240	5326941	Patreon
5343584	5345225	You know how annoying that's going to be?
5345225	5349108	It's going to be like those app, hey, have you reviewed this app yet?
5349108	5353050	Like, it's going to be those pop-up reminders like, hey, are you enjoying this game?
5353050	5354291	You want to send us a tip?
5354291	5357133	Hey, hey, obviously you see that you played the game again.
5357133	5358273	Would you like to send us a tip?
5358273	5359774	Would you want to send us another tip?
5359774	5363016	It's going to be worse than the five-star rating prompts, yeah.
5363016	5364597	It's going to be bad.
5364597	5365158	Do not...
5366445	5371308	just what you do is you say, Mike, shut the fuck up.
5371308	5373389	She's like, we don't want to hear from you anymore.
5373389	5374870	Your ideas are bad.
5374870	5376811	And keep these ideas to yourself, please.
5376811	5377451	Thank you very much.
5377451	5377711	Yeah.
5377711	5381313	Cosmos even chat says, I wish developers were just paid more for their work.
5381313	5381774	Yes.
5381774	5386917	Fifth dream says, well, if they allow tipping, they'll use this excuse to play and pay employees less.
5386917	5390318	Yes, that's, that's, that's it.
5390318	5394101	Like the, the, the money ought to be coming from the top.
5394901	5397264	period, period.
5397264	5408035	I that's, that's what I am fucking sick of is being asked to tip at these places where the money ought to be coming from the top.
5408035	5409076	Exactly.
5409076	5410338	Anyway.
5410338	5411559	All right.
5411559	5416564	Let's move on to a little bit of lighthearted fair of some sort.
5416564	5416965	DarkSakura.
5419333	5424619	Well, there are some new additions to Nintendo Switch Online.
5424619	5432467	We are going to be getting Amazing Hiberike, Super R-Type, which is pretty fun.
5432467	5433848	I love Super R-Type.
5433848	5438293	Wrecking Crew 98 is also going to be on the list.
5441514	5445135	Honestly, I think all of those are pretty, pretty good games.
5445135	5448796	I even have a couple of them, you know.
5448796	5461118	So I think it'd be really interesting to see how Wrecking Crew 98 and Amazing Hebedeke play out for people in the US.
5461118	5468560	Now these are in Japan, but of course, you know, we have ways of getting them.
5468560	5469340	We eventually get them.
5469560	5475522	Well, yeah, it's it's cool that they actually put some Japanese games in the US switch online.
5475522	5476403	I think that's great.
5476403	5484586	You know, the games that didn't have they weren't very text intensive, because like, I remember there was like a P cross update at some point that we got there as well.
5484586	5485266	But um,
5486066	5492931	I, you know, remember, it's very, very, very easy to download the Japanese version of Switch Online.
5492931	5505540	And I would actually super recommend this for the 8-bit NES, because you can play things like Zelda and Metroid as they were on the Nintendo disc system with the extra sound.
5505540	5510884	And so I thought playing Nintendo on the Japanese app was really cool, to be honest.
5510884	5514526	Oh my God, our time had the worst slowdown on the Super Nintendo.
5514526	5514987	So funny.
5516129	5520810	Yeah, but R-Type is a, you know, all the R-Type games are pretty fucking difficult.
5520810	5522791	Yeah.
5522791	5544698	But, you know, I think that it would be nice though, is that for like some of the RPGs, if they would put out English translations, you know, reach out to some of the fan translators out there and just say, hey, we'll give you X amount of money if you let us just use your translation in the game.
5546044	5550148	I mean, I would I thoroughly enjoyed playing.
5550148	5555213	I mean, well, I mean, Live Alive had its remake, but I really enjoyed playing Treasure of the Rudra.
5555213	5560097	I think a lot of people would love to play that game, you know, or the original Star Ocean.
5560097	5562940	I mean, like original, original Star Ocean on SNES.
5565307	5566227	All right, well, let's move on.
5566227	5567628	We have a few more stories for you.
5567628	5570408	And then yes, we have a classic game of the week this week.
5570408	5572729	And I'm sure some of you are very curious.
5572729	5581812	What on earth could DarkSakura pick for episode 1000 that would be worthy of 1000th episode that hasn't been picked yet?
5581812	5583712	And I'm just gonna I'm gonna teach you with this.
5583712	5586213	I've seen the game and I went No, she did this one.
5586213	5586933	She had to have done this.
5586933	5587773	And I looked I looked back.
5587773	5589774	I was like, what?
5589774	5590994	What?
5590994	5592575	How?
5592575	5593235	How?
5595109	5597552	Nintendo is not done trying to smack down emulator developers.
5597552	5601136	This time they are coming after Suyu and Sudachi.
5622390	5630117	Discord has shut down everything connected to Suyu and Sudachi.
5630117	5637765	This includes both the emulator's servers on the platform as well as accounts tied to the developers working on the software.
5644327	5649848	Discord responds to and complies with all legal and valid DMCA requests.
5649848	5658550	In this instance, there was also a court-ordered injunction for the takedown of these materials, and we took action in a manner consistent with the court order.
5661531	5671278	Recognize that there was a court order for any of this at least not one that we've heard about yet So are they is there more legal stuff going on outside of just Yuzu?
5671278	5678644	I'd be curious to find out and according to this You know the what the developers spoke out said
5680461	5694826	that they received basically an email from Discord saying they were in violation of Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines for allegedly sharing content that violates anyone's intellectual property or other rights.
5696887	5702012	See them denying that, necessarily.
5702012	5708298	But, you know, it is kind of interesting that they're coming after just these developers' accounts.
5708298	5714344	Unless, like, I could see if there was evidence... Nintendo is madder about this than they are about PAL World, and that really surprised me, to be honest.
5714344	5715585	Well, so, I mean...
5716366	5728573	I would see, like, if, so it depends, like, if on these discords, if they were sharing, like, the keys or something like that, or trading games or something, I could see there could be an issue.
5728573	5740479	But if it is legit that they don't have any of this stuff on there, it is just support for the emulator, then I think it's kind of an overreach.
5740479	5743561	But, like, also, like, what the hell's wrong with Nintendo?
5743561	5744241	Like, honestly.
5745953	5747954	But I do understand.
5747954	5748894	Push it more underground.
5748894	5755577	I do understand that like when you're emulating current gen retail stuff, it's a very slippery slope.
5755577	5758758	And stop making your goddamn consoles based off of old ass tech.
5758758	5761439	I mean, sorry.
5761439	5761780	Yeah.
5761780	5762720	I mean, yeah.
5762720	5763480	Yeah.
5763480	5770843	Those decisions that, you know, Nintendo has made come back to bite them sometimes.
5770843	5773324	And yeah, that is what it is.
5773324	5775025	But yeah.
5776519	5779241	Anyway, let's move on.
5779241	5782263	And this has also got a lot of people talking this week.
5782263	5787926	This is a digital game that has been pulled from people's libraries.
5787926	5793730	Ubisoft is deleting the crew from players libraries.
5793730	5797833	Now, here's the thing before you know you overreact a little bit, but I don't know.
5797833	5798193	I don't know.
5798193	5799554	There's still some things about this I don't like.
5800854	5806515	The servers were pulled on April 1st anyway, and The Crew was an online-only game.
5806515	5811916	So essentially, your digital copy of The Crew was worthless at this point.
5811916	5815557	You couldn't do anything with it besides, I guess, see a title screen and get an error message.
5815557	5820818	There was really nothing else to experience in this game because there are no more servers.
5820818	5828319	Apparently, Ubisoft Connect, if you had that to launch the game from, the license to play the game has been revoked.
5829019	5834143	Of course, now people are saying this is illegal, you can't do this.
5834143	5838346	Technically, it's probably in the terms of service that you just don't read and accept.
5838346	5846872	So I'm sure we all kind of go like, I don't, I oftentimes don't like going, well, that's why they did it because it's in the terms of service.
5846872	5847953	Like I can accept that.
5847953	5850435	Yes, that is the answer legally.
5850435	5857100	But I also don't like sitting here going that they should be allowed to do that, that they should be allowed to put that in there.
5857901	5860868	and you have to accept it to play the game.
5860868	5865458	Like, there's a part of me that feels like that shouldn't be the system in the first place, to be honest, but...
5866764	5872526	Anyway, um, again, the crew went down the crew to and the crew motor fest are both still going.
5872526	5879148	But if you had the crew through at least if you have a physical copy of the game, they can't exactly come into your house and take it.
5879148	5879749	That's it.
5879749	5885791	But you can't play the digital version of it through the Ubisoft Connect anymore.
5885791	5889152	Now, I think where this is kind of fucked up.
5890092	5894635	is that, like, look at the Pretendo thing we talked about earlier.
5894635	5898036	I don't know if the crew has the community to substantiate this.
5898036	5899397	Maybe they do.
5899397	5903019	But what if somebody wanted to make a different type of server?
5903019	5909323	And I did see some talk at our Discord server to acknowledge this, you know, over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, where it's one of those
5910063	5916747	Essentially, what I'm talking about doing is like those commercials and say, why don't they just turn up the graphics on level three?
5916747	5925832	It's much harder than that you would you would have to have server code that probably doesn't exist out there and that I get it.
5925832	5936998	But for that to not even be an option, because that entire thing has been stripped from your library does seem a little bit tacky to me.
5939204	5948632	If I want a pet rock that is worthless, dammit, let me have my pet rock.
5948632	5949793	And I think it's as simple as that.
5952589	5958451	YYR says in chat, the timing on this was not an accident.
5958451	5962412	Apparently someone was about to put a private server online.
5962412	5964933	Oh, so maybe someone did crack the code.
5964933	5967073	Very interesting.
5967073	5977657	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Terms of Services and ULAs, ULAs, End User License Agreements, have never been actually tested in court because everyone keeps settling.
5978257	5981578	I think the bubble is going to burst on that someday.
5981578	5999864	And we just talked about it was last week or the week before we talked about how there is a advocacy group that is trying to leverage a French organization to, we'll just say, bully Ubisoft in a way they ought to be bullied to stop doing this shit with, you know, delisting and pulling things.
5999864	6001524	This is going to happen with the crew, too.
6001524	6006986	And this is going to happen at the Crew Motor Fest, like stop buying Ubisoft games.
6006986	6007226	All right.
6008308	6015814	Well, let's take an opportunity here on episode 1000 to do something that we have been doing for 750 episodes.
6015814	6017895	To be fair, the Classic Game of the Week started in episode 250.
6017895	6021178	As I see, there's been a lot of landmarks along the way.
6021178	6027263	So 250 was another nice round number, where I think DarkSakura before did like there was like the there's like advice or something.
6027263	6028523	And then there was the website of the week.
6028523	6029084	That was always fun.
6029584	6030725	and Solicited Advice.
6030725	6033767	Yeah, and then it switched to the Classic Game of the Week in Episode 250.
6033767	6035408	And it's stayed that way ever since.
6035408	6039251	And I'm sure a lot of you are curious, what did DarkSakura pick for Episode 1000?
6039251	6045175	And unlike the game we just talked about, this is something you can go back and play.
6045175	6048797	This is games preserved the way we like it.
6048797	6051279	Let me roll the bumper and then we'll get to the game.
6062071	6069817	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6069817	6072879	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
6072879	6079063	All right, DarkSakura, what'd you pick for Episode 1000 Classic Game of the Week?
6079063	6081785	I picked Gradius.
6081785	6083326	I've done Gradius 2.
6083326	6084567	I've done Gradius 3.
6084567	6087189	I have not done Gradius.
6087189	6088670	So, um,
6089557	6100326	Yeah, and trust me, I poured over the wiki and just made a thousand percent sure.
6100326	6115879	And even going back and reading stuff, I was like, I had to recontextualize where I brought up certain things that I'm finding so familiar because I believe I brought up the precursor to Gradius.
6118263	6124707	I brought that up talking about Salamander or Lifeforce.
6124707	6130952	So we'll take a step back and we're gonna go and take that little walk.
6130952	6136015	So Gradius was released in Japanese arcades on February 2nd, 1985.
6139518	6145324	North America got it December 1985 and Europe got it September 1985.
6145324	6150871	So this is one of those situations where Europe got it before we did.
6150871	6153894	It was of course developed by Konami.
6153894	6155576	It was the first in the Gradius series.
6160706	6165428	The version that was released outside of Japan was under the name Nemesis.
6165428	6170549	But of course, there have since been revisions back to the original name.
6170549	6176831	I actually have a Game Boy cartridge that's titled Nemesis.
6176831	6185334	But at any rate, it was originally supposed to be a sequel to its precursor, Scramble.
6186810	6191152	Um, and actually the working title was Scramble 2.
6191152	6194754	Um, but things changed.
6194754	6201196	So, um, you basically play as the spaceship called the Vic Viper.
6201196	6204338	And you have to go through, you know, enemies.
6204338	6207399	And you also get the phrase, destroy the core!
6210360	6219883	This game was novel for one very important reason, and that was its option system.
6219883	6226425	Not really, well, option in particular, but its power-up system including the options and the various lasers.
6227105	6238967	And the fact that one of the lasers actually goes back to an anime that I super enjoyed and always meant to go back and read the books, Lensmen.
6238967	6242928	I'll get to that in a second.
6242928	6253850	So, in other shooters at the time, you would get color-coded power-ups that would have a different effect on your ship.
6255270	6265332	I'm sure if you think of like Raiden, where you get the purple, it's electric, you get the red, it's fire, etc.
6265332	6275634	So a little bit more about the background of this game is that it was created by a game designer named Hiroyasu Machiguchi.
6275634	6278655	It was the first video game he publicly released.
6279515	6293722	He joined Konami in the 1980s as a programmer when Konami was transitioning away from producing metal machines, you know, M-E-D-A-L, to doing video game development.
6293722	6298945	And they wanted him to make a game that would put Konami out there.
6298945	6300966	It would make, you know, give them their
6302603	6310295	Leg up in the evolving genre, or I say the evolving media.
6310295	6316626	So basically, he asked the team what kind of game they'd like to work on.
6318818	6321799	and they wanted to work on another shooting game.
6321799	6330401	The shooting game genre had its resurgence with Xevious from Namco and so they wanted to do better.
6330401	6336183	They took a lot of mechanics and material from Scramble
6337602	6339744	and put a little bit more into it.
6339744	6348209	They came up with different ideas that they would just test out whether or not they thought it was going to work.
6348209	6354193	And they would run it all on an arcade monitor to see how it panned out.
6354193	6364120	With the options, they had 20 different movement patterns that were, you know, basically whittled down until they found the ones that would work.
6364120	6366642	And it was also produced for the Konami Bubble System.
6369224	6379932	And for the Konami bubble system, other things that ran on it were Twinbee and Galactic Warriors.
6379932	6382914	So there you go.
6382914	6388419	But they also took some options, options, some ideas that were used in Star Wars.
6388419	6395024	And like I said, Lensman, the laser weapon was actually completely influenced by Lensman.
6397811	6411899	They had the power meter mechanic where they wanted to give players freedom to select whatever weapons they wanted.
6411899	6416262	And so it was just a big, you know,
6419580	6425784	like way to give people the ultimate sort of satisfying gameplay.
6425784	6442133	And also they put Moai in the game and they've been in every subsequent game as an homage to Xevious and the Nazca lines that were referenced in Xevious.
6442133	6444795	So it
6447409	6454097	I would like some time to just go into different gaming systems one day, maybe that'll be next year.
6454097	6459984	You know, like this Bubble system or the CPS, stuff like that.
6459984	6466231	I think that the Bubble system was interesting because it used a Bubble software cartridge.
6467072	6484468	And it used magnetic bubble memory, which was a sort of NVRAM that had non-volatile RAM that used this magnetic material to hold these bubbles of data.
6484468	6485649	It's an interesting concept.
6489031	6498334	But moving forward, though, of course, the first home conversion came out for Famicom on April 25th, 1986 in Japan.
6498334	6501936	It was limited because of the hardware.
6501936	6508978	There were some designs that were simplified, like the Moai stage, for example.
6508978	6513240	And the maximum amount of options you could get was two instead of four.
6513240	6515901	But it did give us the Konami code.
6517662	6529052	This is the first game for it to appear in and followed in subsequent games such as the other Gradius games, Contra, Lifeforce, and to some extent in Parodius.
6529995	6537140	Um, but with the NES version, um, it came out in North America, December of 1986.
6537140	6544565	And it was the first NES game to have been released by Konami in North America.
6544565	6548327	And the title was kept the same as it was in Japan.
6548327	6550189	It wasn't called Nemesis.
6550189	6555832	And Nintendo, um, had it available in arcades as a Nintendo versus system.
6555832	6559435	Um, it was under the title of versus Gradius and a PlayChoice 10 cartridge.
6561757	6571705	So there was also an MSX version, July 25th, 86.
6571705	6588519	It was changed very similarly to the Famicom version and they added like a bone planet and some different enemies and some warp zones and you could play as a Twinbee.
6589676	6599142	The PC Engine version was November 15, 1991, exclusively in Japan, and it was a 2 megabit HuCard.
6599142	6608669	It was closer to the arcade than the NES and MSX, and it had a desert planet stage, kind of like the Bone Planet was added.
6610229	6615112	and of course lower resolution and it had a degree though of vertical scrolling.
6615112	6626137	As far as other platforms, it came out on various microcomputers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 in Europe as Nemesis the Final Challenge, PC-8801 and X1 in Japan and
6630380	6638049	There was an early version on the X68000, well I say for the early versions of the computer.
6638049	6643736	The original Gradius has been released in the Gradius Deluxe Pack for PlayStation, Saturn, and Windows.
6643736	6644898	I do have the Saturn copy.
6645979	6664294	a Gradius collection for PSP, digital releases for PlayStation 4 and Switch in the Arcade Archive series, and then the Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection from 2019 by Konami was out for PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows.
6664294	6668057	So, of course, the soundtracks have been released.
6668057	6669939	I have somewhere
6670723	6676954	Back there, the vinyl record of Gradius and Gradius 2 soundtracks.
6676954	6679058	I think you have the Gradius 3 one as well.
6679058	6679579	Yeah vinyl.
6682475	6695759	But the game in the arcade went on to be the fifth highest grossing arcade machine of 1986 in Japan.
6695759	6703281	In the UK, Nemesis was the highest grossing arcade game in 1986 on London's Electrocoin charts.
6703281	6708663	And it got really stunning reviews across the board for the arcade version.
6708663	6709703	It was, you know,
6710243	6712784	It was up there.
6712784	6718946	For the ports, the Famicom version sold over a million copies in Japan in 1986.
6718946	6726928	The home computer port went to number 2 in the UK, and the game that beat it was Feud.
6726928	6729849	PC Engine also topped the UK's PC Engine sales.
6731830	6735895	And it got the first Famitsu Best Hit Game Award.
6735895	6743224	They gave it to Famicom, the Famicom version is the best shooting game and listed the second best game of the year, just below Dragon Quest.
6746169	6749591	This has done many sequels.
6749591	6756135	We are now on the seventh generation of Gradius games with Gradius Rebirth.
6756135	6758156	But I mean, there was, you know, Salamander.
6758156	6763879	It was also re-released on the Windows Store in 2013.
6763879	6767541	And the NES port, of course, came out on Switch.
6767541	6772064	And there's an updated release as a Gradius Stage 5 Stronger version.
6773365	6776970	That came out November 14th, 2018, worldwide.
6776970	6782138	And then Gradius SP Second Loop, that also came out.
6782138	6784622	So, there you go.
6784622	6786926	I mean, Gradius.
6789773	6790053	just to
6813211	6815793	BDR, and Beatmania 2DX, to be honest.
6815793	6824560	So, uh, yeah, and Orange Rite says it gave us Gradius full speed, which for a long time we were using as the theme to the Orange Zones Radio To Go edition, uh, at the very beginning.
6824560	6826942	That's a very good call out, Orange Rite, thank you.
6826942	6839091	It should be remembered that, if I recall correctly, the first Gradius song, or reference to Gradius as a song that came out in the Bimani game, was, uh, Gradius Xyber.
6839793	6841393	Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
6841393	6844674	That was in a 5KB video game, right?
6844674	6845795	I do believe so.
6845795	6851476	And of course, there was also... I want to say there was a Salamander song.
6851476	6854317	I know that there was the Metal Gear one.
6854317	6864220	But yeah, that was... I mean, for me, it was among the first shooters I ever played.
6864220	6866701	I mean, I played Galaga and Galaxian.
6867748	6870997	But for me, yeah, that was SalamanderBeatCrushMix.
6875358	6881884	It's just up there in my list of games that I will just pick up and play through.
6881884	6884106	I love the other things that spawned.
6884106	6892934	Because if you think about it, the game spawned other games apart from just in the Gradius series.
6892934	6897237	We have the whole Parodia series.
6897237	6902001	And then, of course, the system that was on also ran Twinbee.
6903556	6910605	And Twinbee, you know, that led us to a whole series of other games as well.
6910605	6915310	It's just really, I can't say enough enough about it.
6915310	6922138	It's a game that has definitely shaped what we think of when we come to a shooter for the most part.
6923885	6927808	definitely a formative game for so many of us in history.
6927808	6931010	A great pick for episode 1000 here on Orange Launch Radio.
6931010	6932371	We're gonna get into some rapid fire news.
6932371	6952604	I have to take a moment to do a personal hijack of the show and I apologize for this, but I also don't because during the segment that DarkSakura was just doing, I just got a text message from my dad who just texted, I'm trying to show this in a way that doesn't give away, there we go, that says, congrats on your 1000th show.
6954286	6958595	You're old man, but I don't know if it's an autocorrect thing or maybe it was intended.
6958595	6962062	It actually says Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.
6962062	6962843	You're old man.
6966966	6975368	I don't know, my dad could have meant that either way, to be quite honest.
6975368	6977388	Well, thank you, Dad, if you're out there still watching.
6977388	6978829	I appreciate it.
6978829	6982449	He knows how to fire up Twitch on his iPad and watch, so I appreciate it.
6982449	6989611	So my dad is in his mid-80s, so he's doing great.
6989611	6994992	By the way, he just had eye surgery a couple weeks ago, and he's doing great.
6995552	6996852	So Cataracts?
6996852	6998033	Yeah, it was Cataracts.
6998033	6998713	So it's very, very routine.
6998713	7001094	Or as my grandmother would say, the Cadillacs.
7001094	7001734	Yeah.
7001734	7002054	Yeah.
7002054	7013337	So anyway, I'm sure he appreciates that I'm spreading all of his business here on the show, but I am admiring how fast he bounced back from the whole thing and now has that bionic vision, you know, with it.
7013337	7017378	Because I think when they're in there doing that, they also kind of touch up the eyes as well.
7017378	7018719	I think he sees even better now.
7018719	7019879	So it's pretty cool.
7019879	7023020	Well, they don't like add technology to it, so.
7023020	7023140	No.
7024249	7033363	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines going on in the industry.
7033363	7034024	Loki we'll go to you.
7035549	7045874	Fallout 4 is going to be getting a next-gen update rolling out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and sort of PC on April 25th.
7045874	7057518	As part of that, they're going to receive their own native apps on both platforms, including a 60fps mode, which is going to be
7059259	7065585	I guess the Xbox version already technically has on the X and S, but they're going to have a native version of that.
7065585	7068407	Performance and quality modes as well.
7068407	7074292	PC players are going to be getting widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, as well as updates to quests.
7074292	7084100	And they even have a brand new Fallout 4 Enclave-centered quest that's going to be coming via the Creation Club.
7085242	7086643	Hey Loki, I like your purple cat ears.
7086643	7088725	The windows that are behind your head on the train.
7108870	7118293	And then we've got some classic SNK games that are now coming to Good Old Games.
7118293	7123835	These are, of course, including lots of your favorites.
7123835	7126736	So, King of Fighters 97, King of Fighters 2003, we have Metal Slug 4, Magician Lord, Last Resort,
7135259	7142291	Lots of titles and those are all available actually right now, which is on sale until tomorrow for
7144224	7146466	It's 389 each.
7146466	7148188	That's a euro.
7148188	7152992	I'm not really sure what that translates to in the US, but cool.
7152992	7156695	I probably already have these several times over considering, you know, Twitch.
7156695	7160539	They gave them away on Twitch some time ago with Amazon Games.
7160539	7161620	Twitch and Steam.
7161620	7165083	I have a cartridge of Magician Lord and KOF 2000 and
7167856	7169176	some of those games, yeah.
7169176	7181659	I had a multi-cart, but I believe Bobby has that multi-cart now for the Neo Geo, because I think I gave that to him with the super gun, so yes.
7181659	7182640	Yes, he does.
7182640	7183360	Yeah.
7183360	7184740	Love that thing.
7184740	7186000	Nice.
7186000	7188481	All right, DarkSakura.
7188481	7189121	Whale.
7189121	7192182	A relic from our past has returned.
7193180	7194681	We have Sunsoft!
7194681	7200465	There will be a retro game selection launching on April 18th in Japan for Switch and PC.
7200465	7204948	There will also be an English release planned.
7204948	7221119	And so the games that are listed for these titles are going to be The Wing of Madula, Firework Thrower, Kantaro, 53 Stations of the Tokaido, and Ripple Island.
7221119	7222159	So I'm...
7223320	7225222	I'm pretty happy about that.
7225222	7226022	That's gonna be cute.
7226022	7230346	Yeah?
7230346	7230466	Yeah.
7231522	7236206	All those Sunsoft classics to me are things like Blaster Master, Fester's Quest, but that's okay.
7236206	7238849	These will be cool too.
7238849	7249438	Y'all might remember that for the holidays this year, I got an Evercade, and unfortunately, it turns out there are some Evercade cartridges that are going out of print.
7249438	7255844	Legacy Cart is when the license to produce the cartridge is expired, so they may not produce more stock of the cartridge.
7256324	7257324	Codemasters Collection 1
7275589	7279090	So there's that one and then Technos Arcade 1 is also being pulled.
7279090	7282791	The Technos Arcade 1 had a Double Dragon 2 in it.
7282791	7287873	And I think one of the Weltris clones or something was in this as well.
7287873	7293755	So this one, the Technos Arcade 1 will not disappear until June.
7293755	7296136	But I'm guessing that's when their license agreement is up or whatever.
7296136	7299497	So just a heads up for you Evercade collectors.
7300296	7301962	I don't recognize a lot of it.
7301962	7305834	They had so the pinball game that was in that was psycho pinball.
7311950	7330967	Ultimate Stuntman, Sensible Soccer, Stunt Buggy, Super Skid Marks, Tennis All Stars, Linus Space Head, Megalomania, Mig-29 Soviet Fighter, Psycho Pinball, CJ's Elephant Antics, Cannon Father, Cosmic Space Head, F-16 Renegade, Boomerang Kid, Big Nose the Caveman, Big Nose Freaks Out and B-52
7332048	7333849	There's only a couple of those I've heard of.
7333849	7339410	And I think these are all games that were much bigger overseas in Britain, because you know, Codemasters is huge.
7339410	7342091	Yeah, I think and that's I think we're Codemasters is based too.
7342091	7343631	So I think it's probably a little bigger.
7343631	7345612	I think the Evercades even are done over there.
7345612	7348073	So I think it's a little bit of bigger deal.
7348073	7349713	But I like sensible soccer.
7349713	7352834	I remember I recognize that, believe it or not, and a few of those others too.
7352834	7355515	So yeah, sounds like it'd be a good collection.
7356547	7358989	There's a cartridge this retired I really want.
7358989	7363613	I know I talked about this on a prior episode, but it's the one that has fucking Dragon's View on it.
7363613	7366235	Dragon 2, Dragon's View, like the Super Nintendo is on it.
7366235	7368277	And like, I think that's such an underrated game.
7368277	7372220	But anyway, it's it was like $90 on eBay.
7372220	7375202	And I was like, Okay, I want it, but I don't want it that much.
7375202	7376684	All right.
7376684	7383349	Let's get into some world release dates and talk about some other games coming out this week.
7383349	7384890	Let's go to Loki in the US.
7384890	7385671	What's coming out this week?
7386826	7387747	A lot.
7387747	7390609	We've got Europa on PC.
7390609	7396934	Grounded, I guess, is coming out of Early Access on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
7396934	7402138	Planet of Lana on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
7402138	7407421	Whisker Waters on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5.
7407421	7411605	And Soul Covenant on PC and PlayStation 5.
7411605	7413026	No Xbox games this week.
7413026	7413786	Surprising.
7414927	7440072	all right traveling to japan uh on the nintendo switch this week there's only one game coming out and that's uh uh doke yusei bang in summer cs version that is it and it is uh in summer it it looks like a it's it's got school girls all over the cover it's that kind of game so that's available on the switch if that's what you want next week by the way not to spoil things too much but next week is iuden chronicles release
7441113	7444817	And that has been a very interesting thing from what I hear.
7444817	7451764	There's been a lot of issues with the physical shipment of that game, especially if you're not in like the US, Japan, like certain countries.
7451764	7457991	They're like, now that even though you donated to Kickstarter, if you want your physical edition, you basically have to pay for it to be shipped to you.
7459092	7462235	And that's causing some ruffled feathers.
7462235	7467679	And I'm kind of going, you know what, I'm glad I got the digital version, to be quite honest, because the shipping is very expensive.
7467679	7471743	So it just sounds like their fulfillment is leaving stuff to be desired.
7471743	7475866	But I'm looking forward to playing the game in a few weeks.
7475866	7477447	Or actually, probably next week, to be honest.
7477447	7479589	No, I think digital will be three days before.
7479589	7480670	So that will be the 20th.
7480670	7481690	So that is within the next week.
7481690	7483272	That'll be before next week's show.
7484192	7486934	All right, on the PlayStation 5, we have a couple games.
7486934	7502284	We have UFO Robot Grandizer, The Feast of the Wolves is out in Japan, and one other release, a multi-language edition, so which includes Japanese, I assume, of Ark Survival Ascended, a PlayStation 5 retail version of
7502884	7528500	the ARK game survival game that's a classic I have friends that play Ingress some lady friends of mine that are they are super in ARK they love ARK they try to get me to keep playing ARK but I don't think ARK is cross platform is the problem and I have ARK on game pass so I'm like let's play on Xbox but I think they have the switch version or something like that so we're not able to play ARK unfortunately but yeah all right how about the UK DarkSakura?
7531403	7535424	Oh, by the way, my mom just says really cool on a thousand episodes.
7535424	7535924	Oh, yay.
7535924	7536384	Hello.
7536384	7538765	Yeah.
7538765	7541065	So just three things on the list.
7541065	7544746	All on my birthday.
7544746	7546307	Both of these are on Switches.
7546307	7551128	World War Z and Farming Simulator Kids.
7551128	7554549	And then for PlayStation and Xbox is Dragon Ball FighterZ.
7556892	7558933	All right, so somewhat of a slow week.
7558933	7559773	Yep.
7559773	7561614	All right, let's do just a few more stories.
7561614	7563154	And then we'll get into the roundtable.
7563154	7564975	I know I saw some emails come in during the show.
7564975	7566416	So we have a few things to read.
7566416	7569097	And I'm sure we'll try to get your chat comments.
7569097	7571258	I'm not going to guarantee we get all the calls.
7571258	7572578	I don't know how many we're gonna have tonight.
7572578	7573939	But we'll we'll do our best.
7573939	7575559	We'll see what happens.
7575559	7577700	Let's get to it.
7577700	7578661	First some stories.
7578661	7579301	Two more stories.
7579301	7579501	Loki.
7580523	7593355	So apparently some fans of Disney Speedstorm are now considering legal action because apparently Gameloft has changed how you can purchase the Battle Passes in-game.
7593355	7596578	So originally... Well, one angry Redditor is threatening legal action.
7596578	7598100	Okay, one angry person.
7598100	7599842	Okay, one person.
7601348	7603450	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7619745	7631856	Currently, it used to be that you could purchase that with just tokens, so you could actually unlock that without spending real money, which is counter to what Gameloft is trying to get you to do, which is to spend real-world money on it.
7631856	7637100	So now, the Golden Pass will only be obtainable through direct purchase of $9.99 or $19.99 with a tier skip.
7637100	7638962	And that is effective starting the 17th of April.
7646849	7651193	If you really want to stick it to Disney, uninstall.
7651193	7653615	I tried Speedstorm, it was okay.
7653615	7656718	Yeah, I mean, there's other games out there.
7656718	7663384	Like, I was browsing through my Twitch stuff, I saw that, you know, Smurf Kart is a thing.
7663384	7667068	You know, you can jump on Smurf Kart, you know?
7667068	7667868	Today's the day.
7667868	7669009	Be your inner Gargamel.
7669009	7669770	How about not?
7671843	7672323	You know what?
7672323	7672844	You're right.
7672844	7674305	You shouldn't be playing Smurf Kart.
7674305	7675485	Garfield Kart's where it's at.
7675485	7676386	That's right.
7676386	7676846	That's right.
7676846	7677627	How about not?
7677627	7678587	Not on Mondays.
7678587	7680609	I hate Mondays.
7680609	7682710	Nermal!
7682710	7683771	Forget about Garfield.
7683771	7687653	Just give me the lasagna and let me watch some Garfield without Garfield.
7687653	7688974	Amen to that.
7688974	7693217	How about just, yeah, instead of playing Garfield Kart, eat lasagna.
7693217	7694157	Eat lasagna.
7694157	7696019	It'll make you happier.
7696019	7699941	Lasagna Kart.
7699941	7700281	Hold on.
7704180	7709046	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7721832	7722573	Interesting.
7722573	7730377	YYR says my wife, the librarian says there's actually been an uptick in requests for Garfield books lately.
7730377	7731318	Not sure what brought that on.
7731318	7732198	There's a movie coming out.
7732198	7733960	There's a movie coming out.
7733960	7734800	Oh, that's right.
7734800	7736021	Another animated movie.
7736021	7739403	They're like rebooting Garfield movies again, right?
7739403	7742825	Yes, because that's what people want.
7742825	7744966	I'll just go back and read the old Bloom County.
7744966	7746227	How about US Acres?
7746227	7748529	Where's their movie?
7748529	7748849	Anyone?
7749491	7753215	You know, we've had voice talent from the cartoon here on this show.
7753215	7753916	That's right.
7753916	7754616	That's right.
7754616	7755637	It's a long time ago.
7755637	7756358	But yeah.
7756358	7757499	All right.
7757499	7758500	Let's get to one more.
7758500	7765348	You know, for the last official story tonight, I thought it would be appropriate to talk about indies, you know, because we're
7765908	7789045	an indie podcast and we're always big on support other independent podcasters and independent games are very important part of this industry and that's what made this triple I initiative thing so great to take on the triple A and they did a big 45 minute showcase this week and you know what it was fucking full of announcements because what they did they just they they cut the shit
7789665	7793308	and they just did trailer, trailer, trailer, trailer, trailer.
7793308	7796311	So from this triple I initiative, you may have heard of some of these things.
7796311	7798372	I'm going to run through some of these things very quickly.
7798372	7800274	Slay the Spire 2.
7800274	7800994	It's official.
7800994	7801615	It's coming.
7801615	7803917	Early access 2025 for those.
7803917	7805258	And there is in Godot too.
7805518	7814741	yeah, RiskofRain2 getting a Devotion update, Shadows of Doubt Sharpshooter getting it or excuse me getting a Sharpshooter Assassin update.
7814741	7819363	Gestalt Steam and Cylinder has a release date of May 21st.
7819363	7821244	This is fucking rad.
7821244	7825065	Vampire Survi- I literally don't know how this is happening.
7825065	7829887	Vampire Survivors is getting Contra characters with like guns.
7829887	7830527	What?
7830527	7831228	Officially.
7831228	7832328	That is awesome.
7832328	7832428	It's
7832768	7842255	But here's the wild thing because for all the talk about lifted art from Castlevania and all this stuff that that game, it's official Konami license.
7842255	7846538	So Contra is coming officially, which is, it's wild.
7846538	7847479	I think this is so cool.
7849281	7852683	Also, even what if they got smash TV stuff?
7852683	7860929	Well, what also cracks me up, even though most people blasted Contra hardcore, except for Dark Tetsuya, this one's for you.
7860929	7870355	They are bringing Brad Fang, the wolf kind of character that fits the theme of vampire survivors into this pack as well, which is is wild.
7870355	7873417	Operation Guns for vampire survivors.
7873417	7878521	Also, I appreciate the name Operation Guns comes out May 9th.
7879441	7880742	Very cool.
7880742	7885724	Undermine 2 was announced as part of this as well.
7885724	7896970	Loki, I did a double take when I heard about the game called What the Car, because I remember you were developing a game called Time to Car, that like many games got canceled.
7896970	7900952	But What the Car, which is different, it's different, but it's coming up.
7900952	7905775	Essentially, what the car is what I'd envisioned it's Time to Car would have been.
7906536	7907416	Thanks for watching!
7919468	7919928	Norland
7949460	7956167	Well, appropriately, it's a sci-fi game about graffiti artists, and it is coming out summer of 2024.
7956167	7963415	An update for Raven's Watch called Fall of Avalon is coming out on April 22nd, so very soon.
7963415	7971083	RPG The Last Spell, a tactical game, is getting some DLC called Dwarves of Runenberg, and that comes out on April 24th.
7972364	7978175	Cat Quest 3, it's coming and it's going to have more than three cats and apparently some ghosts.
7978175	7980820	Why Cat Quest has ghosts?
7980820	7981501	Shut up and play the game.
7981501	7982783	What else are the cats going to stare at?
7982783	7984046	Shut up and play the game.
7984046	7984306	All right.
7986484	7989707	Brotato, Abyssal Terrors, Couch Co-op, Behind the Throne, Old World
8002378	8005723	gets this expansion coming on May 28th.
8005723	8017518	POW World showed up in this because POW World is still, I mean, despite its rampant success, is considered an indie, and the Arena multiplayer made a little teaser in the showcase and is coming out this year.
8017518	8019701	That won't make Nintendo upset whatsoever.
8021783	8046977	33 Immortals is moving into a closed beta on May 24th Wizard of Legend 2, well I remember the play in the first one of these That is, had some more footage shown, some gameplay, but no date of that just yet And then Leisara Summit Kingdom came out in early access as of the announcement It's a mountain city builder, and it was a stealth drop for this
8049398	8053139	Crossover DLC Rising Castlevania Never Alone 2
8071827	8077771	indigenous culture, and this sequel is coming out, which is very cool.
8077771	8085976	And I don't know if you would really consider this indie because it's published by Ubisoft, but I think it's because of the brand.
8085976	8096163	The Dead Cells developers have announced the Rogue Prince of Persia, a roguelite that combines wall running with Arkham style agile combat.
8097825	8099788	Prince of Persia meets Dead Cells
8114943	8119245	Well, that was it for all the stories we had slotted tonight.
8119245	8123347	We'll see if there's last-minute stories, but first, we're going to go to the listener roundtable.
8123347	8127089	If you have some extra questions you want to ask, put them in chat.
8127089	8130070	You bump them if I haven't seen them yet.
8130070	8133312	Sorry, you guys have been very chatty tonight, which I deeply appreciate.
8133312	8134452	I love you all for being here.
8134452	8137234	We've had, obviously, the landmark episode number.
8137234	8140235	We have more viewers tonight than we often have, so thank you, thank you.
8140235	8141856	It is making it a little harder to stay on top of chat.
8141856	8142596	And you're all appreciated.
8142596	8143877	Yes, you all are appreciated.
8143877	8144297	Thank you, thank you.
8145537	8150578	DarkSakura says, I did really dig Dead Cells, so I'm kind of intrigued about their take on Prince of Persia.
8150578	8151058	Oh, for sure.
8151058	8152579	It looked really interesting.
8152579	8153159	All right.
8153159	8154779	I think we do have some emails tonight.
8154779	8157580	Participate at OrangeTonTrader.com is the place to send emails.
8157580	8160120	And we have some tonight, believe it or not.
8160120	8161100	That we do.
8161100	8166841	We have an entire two of them, which is a thousand percent more than we normally have.
8166841	8168782	That's right.
8168782	8173183	So at any rate, God, if the email will freaking open, please open.
8173183	8173863	Email.
8173863	8174183	Thank you.
8176150	8178792	Hello, LR.
8178792	8192146	I was hoping to have something special to announce for this very special occasion, like a two-player deathmatch sequel to Pixel Poops called Pixel Poops Double Duty, or the Tempest-inspired spinoff that Jamie asked for called Vecterds.
8193147	8196268	or perhaps some other unannounced future classic.
8196268	8201449	But since I've been laser focused on my super multitasking project, I haven't had time for much else.
8201449	8206210	So I'll just say congratulations on reaching this super amazing milestone.
8206210	8212352	And also thank you for the massive amount of effort required to bring us the show over these last 22-ish years.
8213292	8222337	I think I can speak for many of your devoted fan base when I say we will gladly sit around your dinner table with you as long as you'll keep inviting us out.
8222337	8224718	Thank you, thank you, and thank you again.
8224718	8229281	I don't want to take up too much time tonight, but I'll leave you with this.
8229281	8234544	Maybe there'll be talk about how old the show is, how old you all are, and so on.
8234544	8242148	Well, speaking of old, last night at Coachella, No Doubt came out on stage, and they put on one of the greatest sets that the festival has ever seen.
8242588	8246672	Gwen Stefani bounced around the stage and belted out the hits just like she was in her 20s.
8246672	8250755	And you have never guessed that she is, in fact, 54 years old.
8250755	8254538	But she's a shining example of being young at heart, just like the three of you.
8254538	8258642	And OLR is great listening every week, as good as it's ever been.
8258642	8261404	So thanks again, and stay young at heart.
8261404	8266309	And if you get the chance, seriously, check out the replay of the No Doubt set.
8266309	8267430	It's so, so good.
8268010	8273272	Have a great week and thanks a thousand times over Aaron YYR.
8273272	8277693	Yeah, very good call out about Gwen Stefani and age being just a number.
8277693	8280114	I saw Gwen in her Vegas show, I think 2019.
8280114	8284875	So it was five years ago, but still, you know, she was pushing 50 at that point.
8284875	8286876	And, you know, very high energy show was great.
8286876	8296599	You know, when I think about like artists, you know, that are what some would consider old that are still doing very, very high energy stuff, Madonna.
8297219	8299080	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8311886	8319871	I think all of her joints are officially made of titanium and mallet rubber.
8319871	8320531	Yeah.
8320531	8329537	Well, and then, of course, Cher, for God's sakes, you know, she might not really be dancing in the same, but the fact that she does what she does, she's in her 70s.
8329537	8330838	Of course, she's Cher.
8330838	8331799	I'm Cher, bitch.
8331799	8334660	Yeah, she's she's fantastic.
8334660	8338463	So, yeah, you're never too old, right?
8338863	8347308	To paraphrase Chad Michaels, I honestly think she has an IV of Lemaire.
8347308	8348949	Oh, yeah.
8348949	8349750	15 points out.
8349750	8351971	Trent Reznor is pushing 60.
8351971	8353452	And Robert Smith is.
8353452	8355233	Yeah, absolutely.
8355233	8357154	So, yeah.
8357154	8358595	And thank you, YYR.
8358595	8362938	Thank you for, you know, obviously we talked a little bit about the indie games.
8362938	8365019	Meshere is an immortal, not a Highlander.
8365019	8366020	Highlanders are from Scotland.
8366700	8371944	No announcement needed, YYR.
8371944	8377487	I know you're working very hard and juggling all the facets of your life, and I can't wait for the super multitasking update.
8377487	8383311	And yeah, thank you for your support and making OLR dreams literally, literally making them a reality.
8383311	8385232	We owe you an awful lot of thanks for that.
8385232	8389595	And we're so excited when we see the success that your games have.
8389595	8394918	They ought to be bigger, quite frankly, but we enjoy seeing the success that is out there.
8396542	8399003	S2100 Matt says I'm going to see Pink in October.
8399003	8402565	I think Pink is still in her 40s, probably about our age, probably in her 40s.
8402565	8406146	With Sheryl Crow, I think Sheryl Crow is about around 60 and guess.
8406146	8408347	Yeah, some good stuff out there.
8409315	8411016	All right, we have another email.
8411016	8411737	Yep.
8411737	8412738	Yeah.
8412738	8414139	Oh, actually, another one popped in.
8414139	8415660	I just saw the inbox pop.
8415660	8420924	So, Dear OLR, I want to give you a big congrats on reaching a thousand episodes.
8420924	8426849	I remember listening back when jokes were made about making it this long, and I had no doubt y'all would have no doubt.
8427629	8438661	Even back during the seventh anniversary when you played Anniversary from Para Para Paradise while listening to congratulatory voicemails, I felt like this was such a special podcast that I never wanted to end.
8438661	8441664	But also I was just jamming hard to that song.
8441664	8444947	I should have done that again.
8444947	8448170	Oh, well, maybe for the birthday, for the birthday.
8448170	8448351	Sorry.
8449338	8453282	This show has been such a comfort and constant for me throughout my life.
8453282	8457286	I want to honestly thank Jamie, Loki, and Rob for the time you've put into this.
8457286	8461650	I'll be here to celebrate when Orange Lounge Radio hits 2,000 episodes as well.
8461650	8465073	Glad you'll be alive.
8465073	8469578	A question I have is, do you plan on having any special guest interviews in the near future?
8469578	8471980	The Kyle Ward episode comes to mind.
8471980	8472921	Thanks, and I love y'all.
8472921	8473562	Garth Wolf.
8474346	8492191	That's a great question and something we haven't really pursued in the COVID or post COVID, whatever you want to call it, the COVID era of our show, you know, where we are virtual now and, you know, we don't really have a studio at this point anymore, which was fine because when we did interviews before, we always did them over Skype or something else.
8492191	8499813	And I kind of was like, well, this format, you know, I wasn't sure how well it would lend itself to guests, but I think we really should be open to that.
8499813	8501474	I would love to have guests on this show.
8502774	8502874	Share!
8520339	8522919	I don't think she'd return our calls, to be quite honest.
8522919	8524880	Realistically, who would you want?
8524880	8527320	Yeah, a lot of people in chat are calling out Kyle Ward.
8527320	8527880	Yeah, yeah.
8527880	8529601	And that was a great interview, obviously.
8529601	8530821	That was a while ago.
8530821	8531221	I'd love.
8531221	8532441	Yeah, I'd love to.
8532441	8535162	Diddy Archaholic made a good point, too.
8535162	8542643	I saw Stevie Nicks a few months ago still sings exactly as she did in her 20s, and she is in her 70s now.
8542643	8546003	Oh, and I'm myself, 54 and still playing music games.
8546003	8547964	Anyone want to challenge me in Beat Saber?
8547964	8548704	I'm pretty good for 54.
8550424	8550885	and Stevie Nicks.
8565353	8566855	Yeah, yes to guests.
8566855	8572581	And you know, to be fair, we had a guest host here a few weeks ago.
8572581	8579108	So why, why couldn't we go we had Rama fill in when Loki was out, we we can have a guest.
8579108	8584834	So it's just a matter of, it can be hard to get people to be here at this very specific time.
8585735	8606689	Marissa tell Greg to come back So yeah, I mean if there if there's something to promote, but I will say this 100% I'm drawing a line to this no Kickstarters, no Kickstarters or anything like it unless I'm willing to maybe consider but certainly not guaranteeing if the product is already finished and
8607213	8609956	And the Kickstarter is publishing costs.
8609956	8619786	I may be going to consider it, but I will never have another Kickstarter campaign on this show that isn't like a shippable product already.
8619786	8621648	So that's all.
8621648	8621888	All right.
8623907	8626068	Uh, there's one more.
8626068	8626368	One more.
8626368	8628810	Oh, we got we got a yeah, just someone in chat.
8628810	8629670	So they just yeah.
8629670	8630811	Go ahead.
8630811	8638056	As I said, it popped up while I was about to read Garth Wolf's Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi.
8638056	8639777	Mishi.
8639777	8640857	Short and sweet email.
8640857	8643559	I just wanted to say congrats on your thousandth show.
8643559	8644600	Keep them coming.
8644600	8646421	Sincerely, Mishikens.
8647850	8649391	I'll take it.
8649391	8652632	I'll take it short, short and sweet like a fortune cookie.
8652632	8653812	I am perfect.
8653812	8654232	I love it.
8654232	8658834	I want a fortune cookie now though.
8658834	8659774	You're fucked.
8659774	8662555	Oh, we don't have a fortune cookie message anymore.
8662555	8664255	Oh, yeah, that used to be a thing on this show.
8664255	8665656	Wasn't it?
8665656	8667697	Yeah, it was an after the credits thing.
8667697	8669877	But I don't stay for after the credits anymore.
8669877	8674779	Because I got Debbie's to play Twitch streaming to do.
8674779	8675079	All right.
8675618	8677339	Yeah, I also need another soda.
8677339	8681321	All right, I am going to open up the green room over at our Discord server.
8681321	8687404	VOGnetwork.com slash Discord is the place if you want to join us.
8687404	8694728	And while we wait to see if anyone wants to call, I am going to check in with Loki for last minute stories.
8694728	8696709	Sure, there's one.
8696709	8699950	So there's a cute little story about game designer Aaron.
8701906	8711189	Piccaroon, who apparently proposed to his fiancée via a playdate game that he made.
8711189	8712449	So that was kind of cute.
8712449	8717350	And essentially, it was a game that, you know, it was a platformer game.
8717350	8719791	And then you would get these different letters.
8719791	8721591	Well, it's called Love Letter.
8721591	8725773	And so you get these different letters and each one would put a letter up on the board.
8725773	8729874	And then it ended up with, you know, will you marry me at the end?
8729874	8730054	So.
8730987	8731687	pretty cute.
8731687	8734729	And of course, she said yes.
8734729	8737050	Oh, I still kind of want to get a playdate.
8737050	8738811	This looks so cute.
8738811	8740911	All right, we have some calls waiting in the green room.
8740911	8742032	Let's get to it again.
8742032	8748335	VOGnetwork.com slash discord if you want to give us a call, but we will get to our first call tonight.
8748335	8748675	Hello.
8748675	8749255	Hello.
8749255	8750316	You're on Orange Zones Radio.
8750316	8750616	Who's this?
8751718	8754479	Oh, hey, everybody.
8754479	8758461	It's the one and only DJ Ranma S. How is everybody doing tonight?
8758461	8766025	I feel complete now, because if we went 1000 episodes and you did not fucking call in for the 1000th episode, I would be like, something is missing.
8766025	8767225	Something is missing tonight.
8767225	8768366	There's an absence.
8768366	8771547	I feel I feel something is missing in the air.
8771547	8773928	And now now you're here.
8773928	8775269	Look, motherfucker, let me tell you.
8775269	8776609	I mean, it's I'm like.
8781774	8782196	How are you?
8785080	8789944	Good, you know, despite the chaos of my life the last 72 hours.
8789944	8792086	We're going to hang up on you because we have a cat.
8792086	8794748	We have a Midna is making an appearance on the show now.
8794748	8800473	I know the podcasters can't see her, but we have Midna is on the show and therefore DJ Ranma S has been bumped.
8800473	8800913	Good night.
8800913	8803695	No, I'm just kidding.
8803695	8805276	No.
8805276	8811301	Yes, I've heard you've been going through a lot, Ranma, so I don't know what to offer other than thoughts and prayers.
8812102	8813825	but please take them.
8813825	8816490	But well, here's the thing.
8816490	8822121	In the gay agenda, we have gotten rid of thoughts and prayers and replaced them with rainbows and sparkles.
8822121	8824365	So enjoy some rainbows and sparkles and good luck.
8826627	8828209	I'm definitely all for that.
8828209	8830430	Everything is just going to work out the way it is.
8830430	8833453	It's just me having to grind a little bit harder.
8833453	8834113	That's all.
8834113	8834714	I hear.
8834714	8835394	I hear.
8835394	8837316	Get back on that pole.
8837316	8837836	Just kidding.
8837836	8838817	All right.
8838817	8840538	All right.
8840538	8843040	What do you want to call in to talk about tonight?
8843040	8851667	Well, I don't want to talk about what's been what y'all discussed, but I want to say on behalf of Anime Jam Session,
8852631	8857173	Ari Rockefeller, Mako Chan, Barry, Senna, everyone.
8857173	8859134	Happy 1000th.
8859134	8861715	We love to see it.
8861715	8862516	Hell yeah.
8862516	8863656	Thank you so much.
8863656	8864096	Thank you.
8864096	8871059	Now who from Anime Jam Session will be administering the 1000 spankings?
8871059	8873220	Hold on.
8873220	8874601	That sounds like a team effort.
8874601	8875041	Oh no.
8875041	8878343	Uh oh.
8878343	8878623	Uh oh.
8879602	8880843	That will be me.
8880843	8881984	Damn, I was hoping it would be Patty.
8881984	8883585	No, I'm just kidding.
8883585	8887307	Well, if you ask nicely, she will, because she has a cat of nine tails.
8887307	8888188	Okay.
8888188	8890169	She's more merciless than I am.
8890169	8893111	Nine at a time, we'll get through it a lot faster.
8893111	8895573	Hold on, hold on.
8895573	8896874	All right.
8896874	8905120	I'm just going to say right now that I... All of you new nasties.
8906337	8910859	Oh, I mean, I was just hanging out with- I own neither of these things.
8910859	8917861	I got it from the little teeny leather alley during Sacred Pride.
8917861	8931865	The fact, I'll just say, I just came back from an outing with a bunch of dirty-minded people and there was somebody there selling these things, which I almost dropped money on, but other things have come up, but you know.
8934171	8937374	I used to have a yaoi paddle somewhere.
8937374	8943458	Oh, DarkSakura, I don't know if you knew, but somebody tried to bring them back.
8943458	8944980	What?
8944980	8951465	And what happened was there was a cease and desist from the original creator saying, no, we're not bringing them back.
8951465	8956568	And the only reason why he created one for Kickstarter, because he never had an opportunity to get one.
8956568	8960131	So he decided to crowdfund one.
8960131	8962193	But I mean, I've had mine from like 2000.
8965051	8972694	Let's just say there's a reason why you can't find yaoi paddles at conventions anymore.
8972694	8973295	Oh, boy.
8973295	8974735	All right.
8974735	8987541	I didn't mean for this call to devolve into yaoi chat, but thank you very much to the cast and crew from Anime Jam Session, which I mean, you guys are no, you know, new, freshly bloomed podcast on the block yourselves.
8987541	8994404	You've been doing this quite some time, and that's a success you all should take delight in over at Anime Jam Session.
8995151	9021420	and we do and you know I get up and I do this I have a science down to it and I love it I enjoy it when I go to conventions and I hand out cards I hear from you oh I listen to you guys I watch you it makes me feel appreciated at least there's somebody that knows who we are and stuff like that and my inbox with cosplayers saying can I get a copy of my photos and I said oh thank you so
9022697	9027329	I, you know, it just makes me, I feel like I've done my part coming in.
9027329	9029494	I'm just paying it forward.
9029494	9031559	Let everyone have their time, you know?
9032327	9033428	Love it.
9033428	9036511	All right, well, Rama, we're gonna let you go so we can make sure we get people.
9036511	9037431	Oh, nope.
9037431	9038392	Oh, yeah.
9038392	9039353	Oh, how?
9039353	9041194	I am so I'm so sorry.
9041194	9041955	You know what?
9041955	9042375	You know what?
9042375	9043296	I'm leaving.
9043296	9043696	I'm leaving.
9043696	9046979	How could I possibly fucking Nope, you can't see me.
9046979	9047960	I'm gone.

9051643	9053304	I am my apologies.
9053304	9055246	1000 apologies for 1000 episodes Rama.
9056747	9058829	I didn't have time to make myself a gin and tonic.
9058829	9059330	Sorry.
9059330	9061352	Look, I just got brought from the husband.
9061352	9062233	Thank you, husband.
9062233	9065276	A coffee because I made puppy dog eyes.
9065276	9066997	So I'm ready to.
9066997	9070441	There's no Bailey's in this, but I will still partake in the toast.
9070441	9071102	Rama, please.
9071949	9073730	I had to get some special water.
9073730	9077053	Wait, listeners, listeners, get your shit together.
9077053	9081236	Listeners, get your, it does not have to be an alcoholic beverage unless you want it to be.
9081236	9081836	It doesn't have to be.
9081836	9083417	Just get, get the nearest beverage.
9083417	9084978	Hydrate, you stupid bitch.
9084978	9086359	Get something nearby.
9086359	9087900	Hydrate or didrate.
9087900	9089982	Simple as that.
9089982	9091783	This is your reminder to hydrate.
9091783	9092083	All right.
9092083	9095165	Hydrate along with Rama.
9095165	9095886	The floor is yours.

9105048	9109890	Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends and podcasters we'll ever be.
9109890	9117714	If we should ever happen to disagree, well then, fuck you, and here's to me.
9117714	9119194	I have one too.
9119194	9121556	A classic.
9121556	9123516	Who's Like Us?
9123516	9125738	Damn few.
9125738	9126638	And they've all been canceled.
9129448	9136393	Which reminds me, Jamie, you should watch the... there's a surprise on the end credits that you might like.
9136393	9138335	End credits?
9139159	9139979	Mm-hmm.
9139979	9142520	There's something there that I kind of snuck in.
9142520	9145622	I know you leave early, but I kind of threw something in there.
9145622	9148843	Ranma decided to give us a little treat for a thousandth episode.
9148843	9150324	So stay tuned.
9150324	9152484	Um, let's see my toast.
9152484	9159447	I'm going to, I'm going to toast a pop tart, a bagel, a crumpet, a tortilla, a pop tart, a toast.
9159447	9160548	Okay.
9160548	9161808	To absent friends.
9161808	9168531	No, um, to the haters, to all of you out there who posted on the internet,
9169670	9190622	that this show was never gonna get as far as it did, that this show was so bad we had no right being on the internet, that this show was, uh, that, that we were so ill-informed on the industry we would never get past a certain episode that we don't know what the fuck we're ever talking about to all of the haters out there.
9190622	9192783	I drink your tears.
9192783	9194384	And aren't they delicious?
9195595	9197316	A little salty.
9197316	9206124	Thank you for that spite that's motivated us for 1,000 episodes.
9206124	9210247	Your tears of stupidity are delicious.
9210247	9212969	I'm going to have another drink.
9212969	9213610	It's a shame.
9213610	9217653	I actually, I was drinking out of my salty survivor tears.
9217653	9221336	I'm going to make a sequel to that for us.
9221336	9222337	Loki, that just leaves you.
9222337	9223038	You want to do a toast?
9224133	9226574	No, I don't know the toast.
9226574	9227295	Okay.
9227295	9228876	All right.
9228876	9230056	Now I'm gonna let you go.
9230056	9230877	Thank you so much.
9230877	9232558	I appreciate you, friend.
9232558	9235439	And until next time.
9235439	9236020	All right.
9236020	9238281	Take care of yourselves and each other.
9238281	9239021	Good night, my friend.
9239021	9241843	All right.

9260799	9265263	Hey, I just calling in to say congrats on 1000 episodes.
9265263	9267004	I'm not sure why my camera is not coming through.

9268866	9269787	Well, welcome.

9296247	9298109	I think it's so funny.
9298109	9300811	Because Brad, you're the one that always gives us shit.
9300811	9303793	Whenever one of us goes, we're old, I'm old.
9303793	9307317	You're the first one to pop up and say shut the fuck up.
9307317	9309338	Basically, right.

9324038	9326260	We love it.
9326260	9329683	So now I just want to say congrats on 1000 episodes and
9332096	9345014	You know, I made a point in chat earlier, it's you guys have birth episodes, birth shows, and y'all were a huge influence on our show.
9345014	9346497	And we didn't even make it half that long.
9347898	9373714	but you but you know what you did you had a damn impressive run a damn impressive run so you know and you know I always I know sometimes you like to tease maybe maybe I'm gonna get the band back together someday if ABBA could do a new album after like 40 fucking years maybe just maybe we'll have to talk off camera because it will have to be something like what you've done post post pandemic
9374096	9374977	Mm hmm.
9374977	9377718	Well, Discord does make it possible.
9377718	9380999	But you do have to use the button.
9380999	9386042	I didn't get used to using the damn button.
9386042	9387643	All right, practice makes perfect.
9387643	9389804	All right, Brad, any other thoughts for us tonight?
9389804	9391024	Y'all have a good one.
9391024	9391704	All right.

9397267	9397627	Take care.
9397627	9399468	Have a good one.
9399468	9399968	See you later.
9399968	9400149	Bye.
9402579	9405440	Great to hear from our friend Brad as well.
9405440	9406721	All right, we have somebody else.
9406721	9408542	Who knew people wanted to call in tonight?
9408542	9409122	I know, right?
9409122	9409682	This is great.
9409682	9410483	I love it.
9410483	9411303	Hello.

9421327	9422968	Hello.
9422968	9426210	Um, to whatever do we owe this phone call tonight?
9426210	9426510	Oh, look.
9429631	9432472	You found the button!
9432472	9434553	Why are the wrong cameras showing up?
9434553	9436333	Oh, well, I don't know.
9436333	9437673	Because of reasons.
9437673	9438433	What's wrong?
9438433	9438713	All right.
9438713	9442954	Maybe I think I have to reorder people here for it to work.
9442954	9443795	All right.
9443795	9444595	We'll figure that out.
9444595	9448176	In the meantime, what what is on your mind, my friend?
9448176	9454657	Well, you know, like I like like everybody else, I'm coming to give you guys your flowers for for just a wonderful
9455242	9457923	Milestone of hitting a thousand episodes.
9457923	9463284	Does giving us our flowers involve singing the Miss America theme song while we walk the stage?
9463284	9464304	Oh, no, I am.
9464304	9465225	I am no performer.
9465225	9466745	You that's that's all.
9466745	9468185	That's all you.
9468185	9477288	OK, I am no performer, but no, just the show, you know, it's just been.
9477288	9482249	So special to all of us, all of us listeners that, you know, like and I think like some of the
9483328	9489989	One of the great things about the show is that, you know, the community that we've kind of fostered over the these many, many years.
9489989	9494430	And just want to thank you all for that, for that.
9494430	9497091	And just all the.
9497091	9502812	All the just all the great vibes you've kind of given us over the years and.
9502812	9506533	And like, I've geez, I don't even know how long I've you know what?
9508093	9509974	I'm wearing this shirt.
9509974	9516956	Oh my God, for the podcast folks, it is an original, an OG DDR Freak t-shirt from DDR Freak.
9516956	9519857	That's one of these secondary DDR Freak shirts.
9519857	9520997	Still.
9520997	9521678	You're probably right.
9521678	9521818	Yes.
9521818	9525379	The old one was the person on the dance pad silhouette.
9525379	9530681	OK, but still the fact that it hasn't broken up after being washed is after all this time is impressive as fuck.
9530681	9531341	That's amazing.
9531341	9533562	I don't even have one of those anymore.
9533562	9534002	Yeah.
9534002	9537263	So like I had like a bunch of these that like I've just like
9538324	9566191	I think this is like my last remaining one that I had like in storage like during a move but um yes this shirt this shirt is a relic like all of us and we all belong in a museum oh man I remember being a moderator over there and just some of the flying times we had as mods yes yes but um but no just um I am a loss for words no just um

9752661	9756203	So it feels so surreal in some ways.
9756203	9757924	But at the same time, it's also like
9758993	9769500	this show and this community and everything has been here like so long that I do, I'm like, okay, yeah, this is like, this is that we made it to that checkpoint.
9769500	9772482	I guess to use a gaming reference, we made it to that checkpoint.
9772482	9774883	And now we're on to the next lap, you know, and
9776564	9792573	The race is not going to go on forever and I think we need to accept and understand that, but we can use this opportunity for a thousand episodes to kind of go, damn, this has really been an incredible run and it's really because of
