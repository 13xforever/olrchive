9844	11525	British reward season continues!
11525	16689	America has seen most of its 2023 award shows take place, and now the BAFTA awards continue their slate as well.
16689	18690	And 4,000 Brits couldn't be wrong!
18690	21632	The most iconic gaming character is, herself, a Brit!
21632	26235	Most iconic doesn't mean longest lasting, most selling, most consistent, it only means most iconic.
26235	28076	And who wouldn't celebrate a Brit as a Brit?
28076	29657	Eat your heart out, GameFAQs.
29657	34620	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about this poll and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34620	36802	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,
39471	41973	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
41973	46796	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46796	53821	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back tonight live April the 7th of 2024.
53821	58984	Episode number, get this, 999 of our show.
58984	64008	The last time ever that our show can be expressed with merely three digits.
64008	64548	That's right.
64548	66730	Next week, kind of a big deal.
66730	68090	We'll get to that in a little bit.
68090	68591	First off,
69072	70679	Three digits do not contain us.
72065	75267	Well, there she is, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
75267	76527	Hi, Jamie.
76527	77348	Hey.
77348	78628	And of course, I am Rob Roberts.
78628	78889	Hello.
78889	79789	Hello.
79789	80589	How are you doing this week?
80589	82290	You are shit.
82290	83051	I know.
83051	83931	No.
83931	86172	So not my birth name, believe it or not.
86172	88473	But, you know, some people think my parents really were that cruel.
88473	89574	We just don't talk about that.
89574	89934	Yeah, I know.
89934	92035	We don't we don't talk about that.
92035	100800	Although I will say that you share a name with one of my late uncles who I tolerated more than the other from that side of my family.
101480	105243	Apparently I share a name with a politician overseas that got in a lot of trouble too.
105243	106424	And I'm like, I don't know her.
106424	107444	Like I've none.
107444	109906	No, no, no business of mine.
109906	110226	Yeah.
110226	113248	So she does a more common name than you'd think.
113248	115290	But you know what?
115290	118232	I got the name on most social media websites.
118232	122214	So I am the Rob Roberts, except not actually at the rubber.
122214	123555	I'm just at Rob Roberts.
123555	127998	So the only place I'm not is Twitter, but I don't care about that site anymore.
127998	128439	Although
129508	129728	I have
150766	157650	I should write a tweet and do some good old self-promotion for those people that didn't follow me to Blue Sky, which is a lot of people.
157650	163493	I can kind of be like, Hey, remember that little show that I used to talk about all the time on this website for like 40?
163493	165914	Hey, we're going to be a thousand.
165914	171697	Hey, that's the only reason I still do anything on there is, you know, like promoting the show.
172957	187762	Well it was funny because I actually went through the last few tweets I wrote on that website before I... I had left one other time when Wish.com Lex Luthor bought the website the first time I left for like four months.
188322	192607	But I came back because I was like, I'm really only hurting myself being gone.
192607	200657	Then when the more lucrative alternatives like Blue Skies showed up and you know, Mastodon, things like that as well, I left again, but I didn't announce my departure.
200657	205162	I was like, you know what, I know people get annoyed at the whole like, this isn't an airport, you don't need to announce your departure.
205162	206563	So I never really said anything.
206563	208305	I just changed my bio and I left.
209006	211727	Um, so where was I going with that?
211727	217108	Oh, I was going through the last tweets I'd written for like, maybe a good two months before I left.
217108	218929	They were all self promotion.
218929	220769	It was like, I'm doing this show.
220769	222130	Come see this show.
222130	223090	I'm doing this thing.
223090	224370	Come see this thing.
224370	234133	And that was I wasn't writing anything, probably because at that point, I was already kind of starting to use blue sky more and more at that point for whatever, like personal tidbits I wanted to say.
234133	235213	So anyway,
236809	239353	Huh, that's that's that's social media.
239353	241276	Let's get to our other host.
241276	248867	Of course, we've got to introduce here as well who has been here with us for 999 weeks now say hello to Techmaster Loki.
248867	249508	Has it been that long?
250270	252071	Believe it or not, it has.
252071	253333	Probably longer, I think.
253333	253673	Yeah.
253673	263020	It doesn't feel like, you know, it's funny because on, you know, with the show turning a thousand, there's a lot of people in my personal life that have been asking, like, isn't your show turning like a thousand soon?
263020	264802	And, you know, isn't, wasn't that coming up?
264802	267984	It's like, yeah, it's going to be like in two weeks or next week we're turning a thousand.
267984	271647	It's like, wow, is it, that's like 20 something years, right?
271647	273069	Does it feel like it's been that long?
273069	276832	And I'm kind of like, it hasn't, it hasn't, you know?
276832	276932	Um,
278396	283818	Like I think, well, I think COVID and the pandemic and all of that really fucked our sense of time for a lot of things.
283818	292682	I don't know how you guys feel about that, but to say the least, it really feels like two plus years of our life just were like taken.
292682	301266	Like one of those, what is, what is the movie with the, was it the princess bride with the thing that like this machine will suck off 10 minutes of your life forever?
301266	301906	Yeah.
301906	305088	It COVID felt like that, but two years worth of work.
305088	305328	Yeah.
305928	307889	That's my day job.
307889	311669	Um, so so in some ways, no, it doesn't feel like it's been that long.
311669	316811	But then you kind of think about like, I was thinking about it today, when this show started in 2002.
316811	324692	So June of 2002 was the first episode of this show, we were live on Life is Five for a long time, we went right into podcasting as soon as that was the thing.
324692	333455	And in the scope of things, which is interesting, because, you know, for a minute, we were doing two shows, because we were doing the live show that was really just about music gaming.
333455	335355	And then we were doing the the
335735	343139	Portable to Go Edition, the podcast that was really about like, you know, all the video game topics, which is basically kind of took over the rest of the show.
343139	345440	This is what the show is now.
345440	351963	And when I was, it was episode around, I think, 168, that we made the switch, around 168.
351963	355025	So in the vast scope of things,
355925	357967	It wasn't that long.
357967	364172	Only about 16-17% of the time we've done OLR was not this format that we're in now.
364172	366034	That is really weird to think about.
366034	370137	Because I feel like the old show that we did, we did that for a very long time.
370137	372039	I keep feeling like, you know what I mean?
372039	379265	Like, when everybody would come to the house, with the music game people would come over, like it was almost like a party every week and all that.
379265	382427	Like, I really feel like that lasted for years.
383228	384829	And I guess it kind of did.
384829	391713	But like, I don't know why, but like thinking back, I feel like that part, like I go back, like how long I felt like that was like at least half the run of the show.
391713	392713	And it really wasn't.
392713	395034	It was only like not even 20%.
395034	396375	So I have to bring this up.
396375	400357	Yeah, apparently we have shattered a hype train record in chat.
400357	401818	You guys are so kind.
401818	402718	Thank you all so much.
402718	403599	Yeah, I usually don't
404239	412823	I don't like to interrupt the podcast because we are a podcast that you can download on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube now in place of Google podcasts and all that good stuff.
412823	414523	So I think it's worth mentioning.
414523	415484	Yeah, no, no, it is.
415484	422066	So I don't usually usually but yeah, when you guys are shattering records and doing these things that are really above and beyond, we have to say something.
422066	424127	I'm sure even the podcasters understand.
424127	425328	That's when we got to say something.
425328	427789	Look at that Loki you did 999 bits.
427789	429389	You didn't have to do that.
429389	430570	And then like five episodes.
431570	438696	Five gift subs from Deft, five gift subs, oh my god, you did like, no, nine gift subs from Loki, five gift subs from Bob.
438696	440978	I wasn't going to do 999, that'd be ridiculous.
440978	441859	That might be a bit much.
441859	446022	I don't think we've had that many people that have ever watched this channel, but that's still, that's still amazing.
446022	448264	Thank you all so much for the generosity.
448264	450046	That's incredible.
450046	451767	Just really appreciate that.
451767	453288	We'll see what next week has to bring.
453288	456932	But I am going to say this, we're going to get into our kickoff topic tonight, but I am going to say this,
457762	460984	don't set your expectations super high.
460984	466428	And I've said this for some time, because everybody's like, well, what guests are you going to get for your 1000th episode?
466428	473572	And it's like, as if they would answer the fucking phone, like they're not going to answer the phone for this little thing that we do.
473572	475593	And it's, it's okay.
475593	476614	You know, and that that's fine.
476614	479336	And people are gonna say, well, you don't know unless you ask.
479336	480397	And that is that is true.
480397	481297	I completely agree with that.
481297	486741	But at the same time, why should it be anything but what it's always been?
488021	492903	Why should we do something completely different just for the sake of a special number?
492903	494764	It's just like the Drag Race finale.
494764	496925	Yeah, it's we keep it to the family.
496925	497645	Yeah.
497645	502847	So it's it's one of those things where we'll we'll do some little little things.
502847	503908	It'll be some little things.
504616	504816	DarkSakura
523698	547948	anyway um so it's not a surprise for you but uh all right anyway uh let's get into games let's do it let's talk about video games and gaming culture as we do here i guess this first story is a little more gaming culture but i thought this was interesting looking at the way technology is really changing and so forth um let's just get to it loki tell us about this very interesting thing that's crossed paths this week
548700	565044	Well, apparently device manufacturer Roku has patented a new technology to essentially allow them to use your HDMI to push ads on devices that don't necessarily have ads.
565044	578207	So, for example, imagine if you're playing your Xbox or something like that and you pause the game, the TV itself would detect that the game is paused and it throw up an ad for you.
580253	582040	Which I see this as...
583843	586164	You're just killing your brand if you do that.
586164	593649	I mean, like, honestly, like, if people find out that, like, this brand of TV... And Roku isn't necessarily a brand of TV.
593649	602254	It is... A lot of TVs have Roku built into it, like my TV, which is a TCL has a Roku streaming device built into it.
602254	603294	It's clunky.
603294	604075	It's fine.
604075	606596	It works okay.
606596	612380	But there's a lot of these devices that are getting more smart, whether you want to or not.
613480	616641	Perfect example, um, my monitor died today.
616641	617921	I bought a new one.
617921	619222	It's a Samsung monitor.
619222	627123	It has Netflix built into it, and, you know, it's got Bixby built into it, and... What the fuck's a Bixby?
627123	627984	What is a Bixby?
627984	636706	A Bixby is a voice assistant, so you can... Can you play the whole... You can talk to your monitor and ask it to do things, to which I'm like,
637884	639526	But I'm hooking a computer to this.
639526	641588	Why would I want to do this through a monitor?
641588	646753	Why would I watch Netflix through a monitor when I have a computer that can play Netflix?
646753	648815	Like it's silly.
648815	649356	I'm sorry.
649356	650136	I'm sorry.
650136	652379	There's only one Bixby.
652379	653940	There's only one Bixby for me.
653940	657303	And that's Bill Bixby, the original Incredible Hulk.
658646	660587	But it came with a remote.
660587	670873	I have a remote for the monitor, which is nice because I can switch the inputs that way without having to, like, fumble trying to find the button on it.
670873	683120	But yeah, it's a lot of unnecessary things that they try to put on there because I'm sure they get kickbacks from these different, like, you know, Netflix and the streaming platforms to include this on here.
683120	684401	They get a kickback for it.
687076	689202	Put that aside, yeah.
689202	693192	I have a feeling if this is going, the route, if they go this route...
694284	695345	I apologize if I set off your stupid
719401	722724	I just assumed not that many people would have that one.
722724	726327	There's the other one from Amazon.
726327	731411	That one is also a part of this as well, so I did not say that one on purpose.
735900	737481	I had to turn that off.
737481	739843	They have it built into the monitor.
739843	740924	By default, it's on.
740924	745548	Thankfully, you can shut it off with a switch.
745548	747830	You don't have to fumble with settings or anything to do that.
747830	750312	But the remote has a microphone on it.
750312	752173	The monitor has a microphone on it.
752173	755156	It has these stupid lights on it that change whenever the
756328	758949	For whatever reason, it's like, you know you're not a TV, right?
758949	759989	You're a monitor.
759989	762329	I got you as a monitor, not a TV.
762329	770171	If I wanted a TV, I would have a much larger display compared to what I have now for the price.
770171	777393	Fun fact, I had a Commodore 64 branded monitor that they sold to Commodore 64, and I actually used that in college.
777833	780575	because it had RCA inputs on the front of it.
780575	786140	I actually used it as my TV for my VHS device and my Super Nintendo.
786140	790723	So we used to play Super Mario Kart on my monitor, my Commodore 64 monitor.
790723	799731	And I could get that maybe there's a scenario where these like the Netflix and everything built in could be like, oh, I'm in a college dorm and stuff like that.
799731	807357	And maybe I have a laptop and I'm living with a roommate in my college dorm and then I leave with my laptop, but my roommate wants to watch Netflix.
807757	809981	And we only have this monitor and so it's like...
811118	837665	that's such a narrow scenario with people having phones and whatnot like sure okay but anyways that aside uh the roku stuff yeah that kind of sucks that they're doing that i'm laughing at bobby saying i also used my commodore 1541 monitor i thought that was the disk drive was the 1541 or was that the 1540 that might be anyway i also used my commodore monitor in college as my tv i had my laser disc player hooked up to it and a surround sound stereo setup
838446	843181	But on this 14 inch Commodore monitor, that is incredible.
843181	843602	That's awesome.
844758	850784	E3VL says they're going to sell for cheap on Black Friday Tigerclaw says that Roku killed their brand when they're forcing people to accept this new terms of service with no way of selecting.
850784	852245	No, you can't use the device unless you accept.
869201	871743	Yeah, worst arbitration after the fact.
871743	874545	People are definitely going to think about the TVs that they're buying.
874545	876346	But let's be real.
876346	884931	The super mondo cheap TVs that people buy on Black Friday, or whatever big sales that stores are doing, are going to be the TVs that have this stuff built into it.
884931	889154	Now my question, I would be very curious how it's detecting that the game's on pause.
889154	891516	I would assume that motion stops
892136	895617	for a certain amount of time, like all motion stops for a certain amount of time on the screen.
895617	904601	But you said Xbox, and I don't know how many of y'all know, but I know the Series X at least does this, and I'm pretty sure the Xbox One did this as well.
904601	909863	But if the game is paused for a certain amount of time, Microsoft has their own thing that starts happening.
909863	918306	It's not ads, but it'll cycle through gamer score achievements, like achievements you're really close to earning, I think achievements you recently earned.
918786	922268	It may show other stuff about the games that you've been playing and things like that.
922268	925710	But like, it's not I wouldn't call it ads.
925710	930212	But it's something that I would say for most people, it's the preferable use of something like this.
930212	937296	Is it showing you relevant data to you know, whatever game you have on pause right now or other games on your Xbox platform?
937296	939257	Okay, Bobby says that is on Xbox One as well.
939257	939537	Thank you.
939537	940798	I thought it was because it's the same.
940798	943979	It's kind of the same front end system on both.
943979	944440	So yeah.
945080	963819	but um and i i honestly think i've seen tvs that do this where you can have them in like a low power mode where they just dimly lit and they show the weather forecast for your area news headlines stock market stuff for people that are into that and things that i think most people would go okay
964600	965701	That's useful.
965701	966801	That's not invasive.
966801	968182	That's, you know, kind of neat.
968182	969443	But Roku doesn't do that.
969443	969743	No, they don't.
969743	979629	Roku advertises streaming service stuff, which... So essentially with Roku... To something that nobody's looking at, really, hence why it's on pause.
979629	979889	Yeah.
979889	991956	So one of the things with Roku, so it says Roku lost over $40 million in 2023 in hardware sales, but made $1.6 billion in ads and services for that year.
994212	996713	So that's why they're going that route.
996713	998613	But then you know what?
998613	1001294	I'll tell you what, here's the compromise with that.
1001294	1012757	Then if you want to provide these displays for free and have them ad supported in that sense, okay.
1013602	1015463	Maybe that's worth it, you know?
1015463	1018225	Well, yeah, it's it's you get what you pay for.
1018225	1020727	And Roku is kind of a cheap brand.
1020727	1026571	So, you know, when you pay less, you're going to get this because that's where their money's coming from.
1026571	1042862	So but I mean, if they think that they're going to like, you know, like the only way I could see this being like really, really bad is if they do one of these forced arbitration things where essentially they release TVs, like say during Black Friday or something like that, people purchase them, then they patch it in later.
1043522	1044103	to do that.
1044103	1046104	Oh, gross barf.
1046104	1058454	But and then then they disable if you don't accept the new terms of service, which I don't know, I feel like ought to be that ought to be an anti consumer thing that ought to like, especially, especially if they're trying to change it after you've already bought it.
1058454	1069343	And like the base thing on there, it should allow you to either revert to the base IO, or not iOS, because that would only be one brand, but base OS, or, you know, accept the terms of service of the new one.
1069343	1071905	That's that would be yeah, to me, I mean,
1074184	1080368	I mean, if this is such a big problem, eventually you'll have hackers trying to, you know, attack this.
1080368	1081929	Oh, I didn't even think of that.
1081929	1083669	Like people hacking the TV.
1083669	1084530	Why not?
1084530	1086651	They hack all these devices to play Doom on it.
1086651	1087792	I mean, sure.
1087792	1089973	Yeah, I think that's Oh, yeah.
1089973	1091113	I didn't even think about people.
1091113	1091474	I don't know.
1091474	1094335	They make their own OS's for these things.
1094335	1097117	I would like to think that, you know, maybe
1098683	1102445	I would go so far as to say just because they patented it doesn't mean they're going to do it
1120896	1126618	But they want to make sure that if anyone can do it, they do it because they thought of it or whatever it is.
1126618	1132580	So but there is definitely, you know, there's already going to be this consumer backlash with this and the negative press and all that.
1132580	1138782	So it's very possible they may say, we're not we're just, you know, protecting our ideas.
1138782	1141804	We're not going to actually use this or whatever, although.
1141804	1147866	Or you never know, someone will make an in-between device that plugs into your HDMI that essentially tricks it into thinking that there's
1148746	1149867	stuff on the screen.
1149867	1151267	Well, I can't wait.
1151267	1154169	I can't wait for when it triggers incorrectly.
1154169	1155510	That's why I'm very curious.
1155510	1158611	What is it looking for to know that your game is paused?
1158611	1162833	Because again, if it's just looking for a still screen, it won't work on Microsoft.
1162833	1165074	It might work on PlayStation.
1165074	1171338	But I want to say even there, when you pause, don't you get it might depend on how you pause it.
1171338	1177501	If you pause by going to the crossbar menu, then you'll have the little animated ads that play on the crossbar thing.
1178174	1199345	I just can't imagine a world in which anybody thinks this is like, okay, like, as far as like, being okay with ads, like, I get annoyed anytime I see ads on there, even if they're on there, like menus and stuff like that, like, like, because you're essentially you're making money after you've already made your money from me, you know, it's, it's clearly I get it.
1199345	1199485	It's
1200575	1205496	It's not even really subsidized because the displays aren't that expensive to manufacture.
1205496	1206997	They're not losing a ton of money.
1206997	1214619	And if they're saying, oh yeah, we lost $40 million on hardware, but we made $1.6 billion.
1214619	1221101	So they're clearly making a lot of money on top of the sale price of the actual device.
1221101	1223702	So I do have a problem with that.
1225301	1238204	It was pointed out in our chat that probably not a lot of people listening to this program are on Roku's because Tigerclaw says, for those who own a Roku TV, there are ways to watch Twitch on it since they don't have the official app anymore.
1238204	1240405	So I guess there's workarounds, but no official Twitch app.
1240405	1241465	I didn't realize that.
1241465	1244446	I know some, like the Switch lost the Twitch app, right?
1244446	1249507	In some places because, you know, probably some of the upgrades Twitch has done behind the scenes, but that's interesting.
1252645	1256969	All right, well, I guess I guess we'll see if anything comes of this.
1256969	1264956	But this could be very interesting because I don't know about y'all, but I do tend to pause games for a long period of time while I go do something else, like use the restroom or fix a snack or something.
1264956	1269960	And yeah, I don't want to come back to, you know, some, especially if it's an ad with volume.
1269960	1271561	I hope it shouldn't have volume, though.
1271561	1272142	That would be.
1272142	1275685	No, I think most of their like pause menu ads are just still ads.
1275925	1287241	yeah okay that's a little less invasive as long as it like instantly clears up when i get back i don't know what effective ads they could show like that but whatever i'm not i'm not the one paying to advertise on those platforms
1288260	1289281	All right.
1289281	1294763	Well, let's Orange Right says to unpause HDMI, shout McDonald's into your remote.
1294763	1295784	Yeah.
1295784	1298085	You have to shout a brand name to unlock it.
1298085	1299125	They did that.
1299125	1300706	Swear your loyalty to a brand.
1300706	1302387	Absolutely ridiculous.
1302387	1304528	No, seriously, like that.
1304528	1306329	You joke about that.
1306329	1308910	That is a thing that they have done.
1308910	1316373	They have had ads and to skip it, you had to type a keyword or something like that to get it to skip by.
1316373	1316794	So like,
1317894	1319756	That is a thing that already exists.
1319756	1321158	Gross.
1321158	1322940	I hate it.
1322940	1324302	All right.
1324302	1330930	Let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week with or without ads, probably mostly without.
1330930	1331911	DarkSakura, we'll go to you.
1331911	1332552	How was your gaming week?
1333596	1335238	It was the usual.
1335238	1337220	I played some Dead by Daylight.
1337220	1354058	Um, I played, well, I didn't do my, um, my Friday stream because it was fuck it Friday where the ballet people get together and, uh, drink and play games and talk shit about people and do drunken choreography.
1354058	1354138	Um,
1356011	1361396	And, uh, but I did play some Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my own.
1361396	1365280	I've actually beaten the game and now I'm doing all the after game stuff.
1365280	1367221	Um, that's pretty fun.
1367221	1377891	Um, and then I did, uh, uh, Dracula XX, Nocturne in the Moonlight, or as we got it, Symphony of the Night, but I'm doing the Saturn version that
1379191	1387174	has the graphics and everything all optimized for what the Saturn was actually capable of instead of the rushed pile of shit we got.
1387174	1395456	And it has all the voice acting from the PSP version and the same translation.
1395456	1398757	So yeah, those were my usual ones.
1398757	1403658	I've been busy otherwise with stuff.
1403658	1405599	Mostly getting rid of shit.
1407847	1411910	Alright, well, we'll go on over to TechMasterLoki.
1411910	1413611	Um, it's been Minecraft this week.
1413611	1420256	I released another episode and I've been just kind of, I don't know, doing what I do.
1420256	1424939	Like, between episodes, you know, it's like, I don't know, I can't focus on anything.
1424939	1426260	I'm just building farms now.
1426260	1428421	So, that's what I've been doing.
1428421	1430643	My basement's a mess now.
1430643	1433605	Um, so yeah, that's pretty much, pretty much what I've been doing.
1434602	1435822	Nice.
1435822	1437223	Uh, let's see my gaming week.
1437223	1443685	Um, a lot of the usual stuff I've talked about on this program before Final Fantasy 14, of course, played a little bit of Overwatch 2.
1443685	1449007	I got to say the little April Fool's event they did in Overwatch 2 is actually kind of cute.
1449007	1452789	Uh, they did this whole thing that was like a re rebalancing is the thing.
1452789	1456530	And they changed players' abilities to make them very silly.
1456530	1458551	But what I really like is that they changed.
1458551	1460952	So, you know, if you've ever watched or played Overwatch,
1461292	1470440	You know when characters use their ultimate abilities, they're gonna say things like, you know, let's say when Cassidy uses his ult, he says, it's high noon.
1470440	1471761	Like most people know that one, right?
1471761	1473262	Cause that's, that's how you know to hide.
1473262	1476064	So you don't get in his area where he can shoot you.
1476064	1481048	Well, in the April Fool's mode, he'll go, it's two or three o'clock in the morning.
1481048	1482850	Like they change, they change it up.
1482850	1487673	Like it's, I know it sounds ridiculous the way I'm saying it, but like, it's so funny as you're playing it.
1487673	1489975	And they say these silly things.
1489975	1490356	I don't know.
1490356	1490836	I laughed.
1490896	1491456	April Fools' Day prank
1511798	1514121	So there's, there's that.
1514121	1524072	And even in the normal game mode, because you can play either one, you're not forced into the like rebalanced mode, you can play a normal game, but they still use their lines.
1524072	1526354	And they all have big googly eyes.
1526354	1531140	So they did all the characters with big googly eyes, which is just really silly, but it's just for a week.
1531460	1532400	So I like it.
1532400	1533361	It's fun.
1533361	1543225	You know, I'm kind of honestly, if this is the direction that Blizzard is going to get to go with under Microsoft, although granted, this has probably been planned for quite some time, but I'm I'm into it.
1543225	1544605	I think it's I think it's fun.
1544605	1546666	So I've been playing a little bit of that.
1546666	1549067	And then, of course, you know, I love to play some mobile games.
1549067	1558871	I played Pokemon Go today because there was a community day thing going on for Bagon or Salamence, which evolves into and I got my four star
1560464	1563586	I have a perfect Salamence, except it's not shiny.
1563586	1566188	I guess a shiny one would be extra perfect.
1566188	1568290	But I did get a three star shiny, which is cool.
1568290	1575254	So I feel like I got everything in that department I need to get in Pokemon Go, as far as the collection goes.
1575254	1580217	I've also been playing a bit of Monster Hunter now, which of course is kind of the newest Niantic game.
1581118	1583440	I think that one plays really well with other people.
1583440	1591245	So I have, you know, friends that I know through Ingress, and we play Pokemon together, we walk Pikmin days together, we kind of play a lot of this stuff.
1591245	1592725	We play Monster Hunter now together.
1592725	1594026	And so we were playing some of that.
1594026	1597709	And I think the multiplayer in that runs, you know, really well.
1597709	1600290	For what it is, I like Monster Hunter now quite a bit.
1600290	1602712	Actually, I just, it is a real grind.
1603132	1606093	You get to a certain point where it becomes very obvious.
1606093	1608834	It's just a frickin grind.
1608834	1614535	But I do understand like, okay, well, like, you know, these games are set up so that you can't beat them in a week.
1614535	1619477	You know, you got to take your time because otherwise, you know, people won't continue to engage with them.
1619477	1621897	But I still like it well enough for what it is.
1621897	1626318	So those are pretty yeah, Mike Defton chat says just like a regular mon hun.
1626318	1630240	Yeah, pretty much but like, somehow worse.
1630240	1631400	So just keep that in mind.
1632080	1634342	Otherwise, that's honestly pretty much it for my gaming week.
1634342	1636463	I haven't jumped into a lot of new stuff yet.
1636463	1641786	Although, as I mentioned at the end of Bobby's show, my friend and I are looking for like a dungeon crawler to jump into.
1641786	1647870	He doesn't want to really play Diablo, and we tried Grim Dawn for a hot second, and that was okay, but I don't know.
1647870	1648711	What about Baldur's Gate?
1649720	1651822	Um, maybe like the original?
1651822	1653124	Or like the new one?
1653124	1654245	The new one?
1654245	1660170	Maybe that's a little bit I like I like the more like loot dropping type of things like Baldur's Gate.
1660170	1661412	I do want to play it.
1661412	1663614	I didn't like that one multiplayer.
1663614	1664515	I tried doing it.
1664515	1665276	Minecraft Dungeons?
1665936	1670943	I actually thought of that one as I was looking like, you know, obviously I asked Google, you know, what are some of the top ones?
1670943	1674227	And I saw Minecraft Dungeons is like, Oh, yeah, that one's kind of fun.
1674227	1675368	So maybe that we'll see.
1675368	1675648	We'll see.
1675648	1676389	I've got some good ideas.
1676389	1678832	I asked during Bobby's show and got a few other ideas, too.
1678832	1681816	So I forgot about Lost Epic, too, is one to check out.
1681816	1683258	So we'll see.
1683258	1683518	All right.
1684099	1688220	Anyway, oh, and Orange Rite talked about Fortnite in chat.
1688220	1689980	I did play a little bit of Fortnite festival.
1689980	1695562	Do you know they've been adding a lot of songs to that they add like seven new songs a week to that mode right now.
1695562	1699103	Yeah, I'm still never gonna pay the price they're asking to download the songs.
1699103	1702624	But to go in there and look at the dailies free rotation and play a handful of songs.
1702624	1704144	There's, there's always something in there.
1704144	1705364	I usually go, huh, that's neat.
1705364	1706745	I'm play that one before.
1706745	1708085	So it's kind of fun.
1709774	1718476	Orange Rite says in chat, Fortnite Festival makes me want to get back into Rock Band because it, it, this is Rock Band, Fortnite Festival is Rock Band 5.
1718476	1719696	And you may not like that.
1719696	1721577	And you may say, but it's missing this.
1721577	1723457	It doesn't.
1723457	1727918	But Epic Games bought Harmonix for this.
1727918	1731379	This is Rock Band 5, whether you like it or not.
1731379	1731619	Fine.
1732324	1736489	So, um, hey, at least there's like a lot, a lot of songs in it.
1736489	1737590	So, but I get it.
1737590	1737950	I get it.
1737950	1742735	You want to play, you want to play the old school one that really was rock band.
1742735	1743536	All right.
1743536	1747921	Anyway, uh, let's get into some more headlines and talk about what else is going on in gaming news.
1747921	1748642	Loki, go to you.
1749773	1750813	Yep.
1750813	1767779	So there is a new movement now being led by Accursed Farms, is a YouTube channel run by Russ Scott, who is trying to basically push for video game preservation.
1767779	1768700	Like, for example,
1769600	1787388	The one that they are focusing on right now is The Crew and you know because a lot of these online games that get put out that or even not necessarily online games but games that nowadays require an online connection for them to function even single-player games where
1788484	1789486	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
1802515	1812543	have legislation be put in place to basically disallowing these companies from leaving these games in unplayable states.
1812543	1824292	Some of the things that they're focusing on, one, of course, being in a playable state, two, allowing folks to basically, you know, guaranteeing that they're not going to be
1826440	1829101	The above should apply to games that have sold microtransactions to the customers.
1851277	1865490	things as part that you've purchased and the above cannot be superseded by end-user license agreements because a lot of these companies like to skirt their responsibility by writing into it a ULIST.
1865490	1872556	So right now they were saying that they they're pushing folks to kind of file
1874471	1882320	I guess grievances with there's a French, I think a consumer body.
1882320	1884562	I'm not really sure what it is.
1884562	1890329	But I know they are in France, and they kind of, you can do that outside of the country.
1890329	1893072	But it also works because Ubisoft being a French company,
1894513	1898956	You know, certainly they would be the ones that are most overseeing them.
1898956	1905319	And it's not necessarily just Ubisoft, but I guess starting with this would be a good place to kind of look at.
1905319	1914504	But, you know, eventually there's going to be other games that are going to die like this that you may have bought, you know, content in or whatnot.
1916929	1920853	Certainly like, for example, Suicide Squad.
1920853	1925918	You know, right now, I know you have to connect to the Warner Brothers servers for that.
1925918	1928100	I don't know if there's an offline version of that.
1928100	1930223	I think you have to be connected to that.
1930223	1938271	And so eventually, probably very soon, when that game dies, remember, it's a $70 game, you're gonna have $70 paperweight.
1942076	1947483	So they need to be able to patch that so that it is available offline.
1960760	1987653	you you were screwed we have to accept that this is the status quo that companies are able to do this to us because legally you know they make you press the y button up front before you're ever allowed to start playing and do all this you accept the terms of service and therefore you know you the consumer should know these things before you drop 70 on a game so the onus is on you and I kind of like this approach of and I don't know how well it's going to work because I know our fucking government doesn't function or should
1987913	1988613	and more.
2013899	2015640	I'm just gonna tell it like it is.
2015640	2023284	The reality is because we never fucking get anything done in America because our government doesn't fucking function for any of us.
2023284	2030708	The reality is we look to Europe to set the standards for a lot of this stuff and they have done it for things like privacy.
2030708	2035711	They've done it for things like these sorts of consumer acts, and they just did it for AI.
2036451	2038632	because we have failed to do this.
2038632	2040412	So yet again, here we go.
2040412	2045154	And I think this is a brilliant idea to target folks over there to say, you know what?
2045154	2046334	No, fuck that.
2046334	2048715	You should not be able to have a terms of service.
2048715	2054797	You as the person making this product to sell that product need to meet these certain conditions.
2054797	2055537	And look, I get it.
2056477	2059019	Servers online ain't free.
2059019	2059979	I get it.
2059979	2060980	But you know what?
2060980	2076769	Then, if a server is going to get shut down, what you ought to do is release that software, release that program that will allow me to run my own server if I want to, or someone else to run their own server, or whatever it takes.
2076769	2078970	That onus should be on you.
2078970	2079671	You're like, I think it did.
2079671	2081292	Yes, they took PSO2 down.
2081292	2082032	Bingo.
2082032	2082733	You know.
2082733	2083573	It was Blue Burst.
2083573	2084594	PSO2 is still up.
2085154	2086475	But you're talking about Blue Burst, yeah.
2086475	2087336	Blue Burst, yeah.
2087336	2089557	Or just don't make your game rely on that anyways.
2089557	2090218	And I get it.
2090218	2093340	Some things are unavoidable if it's like an MMO or something like that.
2093340	2097423	But at the very least, they could patch it in so that it's offline.
2097423	2103988	If you are interested in this and participating... They could put a big sticker on the box that says, this game does not function without internet.
2103988	2104728	Yeah, they should.
2104728	2105289	They should do that.
2105289	2106229	And they don't.
2106229	2109532	So stop... Of course, not that the box matters anymore in this era.
2109532	2112234	So maybe that is not really forward thinking, but yeah.
2112814	2115695	So if you're interested, stopkillinggames.com.
2115695	2119797	Easy enough to remember, and you can go there and they will give you step-by-step instructions for different countries.
2119797	2120758	How is that not taken?
2120758	2122259	How is that not taken?
2122259	2125820	Because no one wants to stop killing games, they gotta kill games.
2125820	2127741	It is taken by those people.
2127741	2132424	No, I'm just saying, how was it not taken until this point?
2132424	2134625	I'm kind of impressed, to be quite honest.
2135723	2136303	Interesting.
2136303	2136743	Yeah.
2136743	2137524	Wow.
2137524	2140585	So there and I love they have targeted this game.
2140585	2140785	Yeah.
2140785	2143126	Loki was kind of saying that it's all right here.
2143126	2145547	That's that's pretty awesome.
2145547	2146387	Take action.
2146387	2147668	Select your country of residence.
2147668	2147888	All right.
2147888	2150449	What can I do in the US?
2150449	2150969	Interesting.
2150969	2152570	Here's the options you can take.
2152570	2153330	Spread the word.
2153330	2153610	All right.
2153610	2154250	Well, we did that.
2154250	2154910	We spread the word.
2154910	2158672	It's not social media, but podcasting is kind of social media, right?
2158672	2159932	Contact the FTC.
2159932	2160973	Interesting.
2160973	2161333	All right.
2161913	2163354	And they tell you how to do it.
2163354	2166835	Yeah, they really just walk you through this.
2166835	2170657	The GCCRF, that would be the France body.
2170657	2173958	I'm trying to remember what the actual acronym stands for.
2173958	2182722	It stands for the France's Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control.
2182722	2183942	Rolls off the tongue.
2183942	2188184	But, you know, hopefully they'll be able to take action on that stuff.
2189273	2189973	Priorité Moyenne Hotte
2206656	2207997	You don't have to be in France.
2207997	2210058	You can you can do it anywhere.
2210058	2211959	They take in.
2211959	2212700	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2212700	2213360	No, I'm sorry.
2213360	2214180	Yeah, because you have that.
2214180	2214621	Yeah, I'm sorry.
2214621	2215201	Because you have that here.
2215201	2217582	But I was just I was looking like, what can they do?
2217582	2218443	And that is one of the options.
2218443	2219784	They have the others as well.
2219784	2226427	So, yeah, but I I would just assume it's going to hold more weight or whatever if more people from France do it.
2226427	2227568	Maybe not.
2227568	2231250	Apprenez simplement le français.
2231250	2232191	Yes.
2232191	2232951	Just learn French.
2232951	2235573	Oui, oui.
2235573	2235773	Non.
2237378	2239779	No, no, no, no.
2239779	2240700	I don't want to tease, right?
2240700	2244542	Look, I have mad respect for people that can speak multiple languages.
2244542	2245862	I have tried.
2245862	2248384	And my Spanish is very bad.
2248384	2254847	So I do not, you know, it's it is what I mad respect for people who can speak multiple languages because it's a very difficult thing to do.
2254847	2256988	So but anyway, that's great.
2256988	2258389	I speak a little bit of French.
2260849	2265771	Props to these folks at StopKillingGames.com.
2265771	2267832	We're trying to do something about this.
2267832	2270553	I think it's going to be fascinating to see how this develops.
2270553	2273313	So we'll see.
2273313	2273654	All right.
2273654	2276855	Oh, Def says I still got it wrong.
2276855	2277455	Moi aussi.
2278874	2281476	All right.
2281476	2292425	Let's move on and talk about, well, this is, you know, a nice, as opposed to, you know, all this stuff about games that are closing down and, you know, losing the server support forever.
2292425	2295627	This is kind of neat what's happening with Xbox.
2295627	2304754	And this is a move that the new president of Xbox, Sarah Bond, has done, is setting up a new team that is going to be dedicated to game preservation.
2305655	2309536	as well as forward-thinking compatibility.
2309536	2324341	So basically what happened, there was a report by Windows Central that got some emails, intercepted some emails from Microsoft, where Sarah Bond, who's the president of Xbox, was talking about some different topics.
2324341	2328542	One of those topics was that there is a new Xbox under development.
2328542	2330363	That's not what we all know,
2331343	2332384	Ooh, hardware.
2332384	2335666	Yeah, hardware is under development for a very long time.
2335666	2338507	PlayStation 6 is under development.
2338507	2341629	The day the PlayStation 5 was released.
2341629	2342270	Yeah.
2342270	2345271	So they are making a new Xbox.
2345271	2350394	But in the email, Sarah Bond says it is the biggest technical leap ever in a generation.
2350394	2351315	That's true.
2351315	2351995	That's a little.
2351995	2352516	Yeah.
2352516	2353596	They say that every time.
2353596	2353796	Right.
2353796	2354937	But OK, sure.
2354937	2357979	They're you know, because I'm sure a lot of us are sitting here going, yo,
2358639	2373509	Series X, PlayStation 5, modern PCs, they really push the boundary on graphics and what's possible like what's gonna be but it's like we say that every time we say that every time on this fucking Super Nintendo or even the regular Nintendo playing Super Mario Brothers 2.
2373509	2375650	This is like a cartoon.
2375650	2379433	Graphics are never gonna get better than this.
2379433	2384717	Then they remastered Super Mario Brothers 2 for the Super Nintendo and it still looked really good.
2384717	2385517	And so on and so on.
2385517	2387959	Of course, they haven't done it again, but that's all right.
2388759	2410294	Anyway, also, as part of this email, and this is the part that's getting people's attention, Sarah Bond said in the email that a dedicated team is being set up to future-proof the digital Xbox game library across future hardware paradigms to, quote, build on Xbox's strong history of delivering backward compatibility.
2411115	2417557	This is really funny because I'm sure we all remember a time when Xbox was very like, no, we're not doing anything with it.
2417557	2418557	It's not a priority for us.
2418557	2419617	We're never going to do it.
2419617	2421878	That those are the Don Mattrick years, right?
2421878	2428920	And then when Don Mattrick got the boot, and then that what was the first thing they started tackling once they got once once he got the sack?
2430006	2433368	Actually, no, because Don Mattrick was there for the launch of the Xbox One.
2433368	2434529	So I take it.
2434529	2435809	I take it back.
2435809	2447276	It was still during his years, but there was definitely some changes at the helm that had them going this direction, because they said very much at one point they weren't going to do backwards compatibility.
2447276	2449978	And then they then they they did it.
2449978	2454580	And now, yes, I would say Microsoft in many ways is kind of leading the way.
2456201	2462886	Sure, Sony PlayStation 5 plays PlayStation 4 games and kind of does 3-2-1 through cloud and stuff.
2462886	2466028	Like they've got their own kind of workaround, but it's different, right?
2466028	2470771	So it's, you know, Microsoft's in a great position in that department.
2470771	2484141	Also part of the email, kind of unrelated, but Diablo 4 has become most prominent on Xbox versus any other platform since the game started inclusion on Xbox Game Pass, which was just a couple of weeks ago.
2484901	2500990	that kind of surprise I wonder if it's concurrent players as of now because that really surprises me it's still even over PC after the PC launch but if we're talking about oh the concurrent players from last week then yeah I'd believe that so interesting
2502042	2518740	Anyway, pretty neat that they're doing a team to look at that and the fact that you know when they when we talk about like the forward as well, that means when they release a new platform, making sure that the new platform will still be able to play all the older games, which I think is is really cool.
2518740	2521824	So there is more that will be shared.
2522344	2527285	supposedly on the Xbox showcase, which will be June 9th, 2024.
2527285	2530066	That would have been the old E3 timeframe.
2530066	2538428	So Xbox is still planning on doing an announcement in that kind of, you know, in the spirit of what used to be E3 week around that same time.
2538428	2539609	So that could be very interesting.
2539609	2546751	Maybe they'll put some new games on backwards compatibility, which they said they weren't going to do, but this whole thing kind of opens that door.
2546751	2550652	Well, maybe, you know, one game that's still not backwards compatible.
2551678	2553480	Any of the DDR games.
2553480	2556905	All the DDR games from Xbox and Xbox 360 still not backwards compatible.
2556905	2560469	And I imagine there's like a weird music licensing thing in there.
2560469	2561410	Absolutely.
2561410	2564474	But would it be nice if those games would come back?
2564474	2565636	Although, yeah, we'll see.
2567575	2573338	Questbuster in chat says, as a tangent to Diablo 4, I will always accept a Diablo 4 tangent because I really like that game.
2573338	2579501	Word is that the PTR or Public Test Realm fixes they have in store for Season 4 are being received very well.
2579501	2586884	Well, the fact that they even did a PTR is a huge improvement in my book, because all of the number-crunching nerds are going to be in there.
2586884	2588485	And I say that with all due respect.
2588485	2594848	If it was not for you number-crunching nerds, I would not have my builds on websites that I can just follow to do what I want to do.
2595288	2608575	So they're all in there and apparently the fact that they can test and show what is completely imbalanced versus something else through all that hard testing I think is going to be very helpful for Season 4 as it is.
2608575	2610556	So I'm really looking forward to it.
2610556	2612197	The launch of Season 4 got pushed back though.
2612197	2621201	It's going to be in mid-May now instead of in a couple weeks because they wanted that extra time to be able to implement PTR feedback, which I think is a great call.
2621201	2622382	So stay tuned for that.
2623459	2625788	Alright, moving on, DarkSakura, let's go to you.
2627335	2640486	So, and we had, we had mentioned about this before, um, that the, uh, Nintendo Live, uh, 2024 was not going to be taking place in Tokyo because of, uh, some threats.
2640486	2653997	And, uh, according to, uh, newspaper Kyoto Shimbun, which is, you know, the newspaper out of Kyoto, um, they've arrested, uh, police have arrested the suspect who was linked to those threats.
2653997	2654177	Um.
2655891	2659793	They, uh, I mean, the event was supposed to happen in January.
2659793	2667096	Um, it would have the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Splatoon 3 competitions along with, you know, the usual Nintendo stuff.
2667096	2671758	But, um, they, uh, they put it off, um, because of these threats.
2671758	2683464	And so, um, now they, uh, they have a suspect in hand, but they don't know if their motives, like what their motives actually are.
2684564	2700634	Um, and I really do hope that, I mean, I'm glad that they caught somebody, but I really do hope it is the right person just because the Japanese justice system is very, um, against the, the suspected.
2700634	2701734	I'll put it that way.
2701734	2704076	You love to see accountability, but only when it's right.
2704981	2706262	Exactly, exactly.
2706262	2713366	So I really do hope that this is the person who is making the threats and that they did indeed catch them.
2713366	2718108	And I would like to see, you know, a safe and fun event happen.
2718108	2725252	Really, that's the primary thing is, I mean, honestly enough, I just want people to stop being shits.
2725252	2726593	You know, but that doesn't happen.
2726593	2727513	Yeah.
2727513	2727833	Come on.
2727833	2730975	Shitty people gonna shit.
2730975	2732596	Yeah, but I'm glad, you know,
2733171	2734840	I'm glad they were proactive about it too.
2736860	2737180	It's good.
2737180	2741143	It's good to see this sort of accountability because it's a deterrent, you know, again, we hope it's right.
2741143	2750408	But assuming it is, you know, we'd love to see this type of accountability because it deters people from being shits in the future if they like, Oh, shit, I probably, you know, shouldn't do that.
2750408	2759974	You know, that's been part of the frustrating thing with, you know, everything that's happened with the swatting phenomenon is that you completely see, you know, these horrible things that are happening to people.
2759974	2763856	And there's a very big lack of accountability in the people that pull the pranks.
2764456	2778007	And I know we see some police departments and so forth are starting to do more about that, but how frustrating because it really feels like they've been behind the curve on what shitheads on the internet are doing that this continues to happen.
2778007	2779168	So anyway.
2780399	2791923	Oh, and that's why I think that I'm going to take just a slight aside here is that the moment that you're getting any sort of harassment online from any particular person or group, you make note of it.
2791923	2798165	Like it's one thing if it's just like, oh, you know, someone just being shitty and then you never see them again.
2798165	2801967	But I would definitely if you're seeing repeat offenders,
2803908	2811734	or if people, I mean, you'll be able to tell if someone is just on you, right?
2811734	2824944	Keep a record of every interaction with this person, everything that someone says, hey, so-and-so was talking about you and or any time that you see them in a lobby that you're in.
2824944	2829848	You know, if you have even if you just have that gut feeling, save your screenshots, save your receipts.
2829848	2831289	You never know when it's going to help you.
2831289	2831629	Yeah.
2832918	2835560	Hey, it's not just 999 episodes.
2835560	2838843	It's 999 tangents that we go on in a typical episode.
2838843	2839604	But no, it is.
2839604	2840545	It is good advice.
2840545	2843708	You know, document, document that shit.
2843708	2844869	Oh, God.
2844869	2848532	Honestly, I document everything because you never know.
2849505	2851187	You never know.
2851187	2852027	All right.
2852027	2854249	You should see the file I have on you, Rob.
2854249	2857131	I'm kind of scared because I'm I'm a forgetful person.
2857131	2858732	So I'm sure my file is full.
2858732	2861535	Like remember that time, like seven years ago, you said that thing.
2861535	2863796	And I'll be like, no, I don't.
2863796	2869260	I Rob, I just have one little phrase for you.
2869260	2870421	Who needs a dining room?
2870421	2871222	Efsler.
2871222	2873324	No, I'm just kidding.
2873324	2873644	No.
2873644	2874364	You know what I mean?
2875785	2877226	Speaking of recent conversation.
2877226	2879027	Well, we'll get to that later in the show.
2879027	2880588	That's for sure.
2880588	2881628	All right.
2881628	2886791	Anyway, let's move on and talk about this next story, Loki.
2886791	2889953	Oh, this is something your kids play, right?
2889953	2890853	Yeah.
2890853	2891734	Yes.
2891734	2892554	Yes, actually.
2892554	2894995	I had to think about it.
2894995	2895876	Had to think about it.
2895876	2899738	But yes, very significantly, they play it.
2899738	2901579	But yeah, apparently, you know, there's
2902714	2913001	I mean, it's been a while now that people have been calling Roblox kind of exploitative for children, you know, that they're exploiting child labor or whatever.
2913001	2924708	But actually, now we have the Roblox studio head, Stefano Corazza, trying very poorly to say, hey, you know what?
2924708	2928170	You can look at it like that, but it's not quite like that.
2929844	2934525	but I'll let you judge for yourself based off his comments here.
2934525	2938887	So it's like, I don't know, you could say this for a lot of things, right?
2938887	2942448	Like you could say, okay, we're exploiting, you know, child labor, right?
2942448	2949249	Or you could say we're offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job and even like an income.
2949249	2954571	So I can be like a 15 year, this is actually verbatim, I'm not even trying to paraphrase this.
2955171	2965639	So I can be like 15 years old in Indonesia living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something and make money and then sustain my life.
2965639	2969241	One, you know, that's still child labor.
2969241	2978107	Like, just because you're saying, well, it's okay here because, you know, the children need money to survive because they're impoverished.
2978107	2981390	I mispronounced that twice.
2981390	2981610	Poor.
2983511	2985633	It's it's still child labor.
2985633	2987574	You're still exploiting child labor.
2987574	2989715	Like, I'm sorry, this is what it is.
2989715	2990336	It's fast.
2990336	2990696	I'm sorry.
2990696	3012771	I know you still got more to read, but it's fascinating to me that somewhere at Roblox headquarters, somewhere in a skyscraper where Roblox is headquartered somewhere in the world, there was an executive level meeting this week to discuss, OK, we need to brainstorm reasons to justify children working to tell the press.
3013651	3016754	How did we get from accusation to this response?
3016754	3019096	There was a well-crafted response here.
3039967	3043051	I don't know, but then they just keep going.
3043051	3047817	They just keep shoving that foot further up into their throat.
3047817	3052363	Then they go to explain that, you know... Why do I feel my foot in my butt?
3053671	3060834	But of course there are people that are teenagers and we've hired some teenagers that have had millions of players on the platform.
3060834	3065615	And then also said that they feel like, oh my God, this is the biggest gift.
3065615	3067316	All of a sudden I could create something.
3067316	3068416	I had millions of users.
3068416	3070917	I made so much money I could retire.
3070917	3075619	Yeah, I don't think that's going to be the majority of the platform people making that kind of money.
3075619	3082781	And not to mention that people can't make that kind of money because you take a cut every single possible place on that platform.
3083061	3083641	That's it.
3083641	3086043	The teenagers made money.
3086043	3091206	How much of that money did you take out of a teenager's pocket?
3091206	3093268	Again, big meeting to discuss.
3093268	3096430	How do we justify?
3096430	3103815	They pay less than 30% of what you make in the game to the actual player, because you have to cash out.
3103815	3107257	You have to have 100,000 roblox, which I think is like
3108544	3111007	That's a lot of I want to say 100,000 800 is I believe $20.
3111007	3111727	It's a lot.
3111727	3112248	So Oh, $1,000 is okay.
3112248	3114270	So you're gonna have $1,000.
3114270	3116953	Then roblox is cut, you end up with $350.
3130427	3130607	out of
3149870	3150791	Where's the outcry there?
3150791	3155335	I mean, there is outcry, but, you know, they're justifying it with, well, hey, you know what?
3155335	3156255	What are they gonna do?
3156255	3160519	Are they gonna... They're making games that they'll be able to earn some money to live, you know?
3160519	3163862	Otherwise, they're gonna be in one of those sweatshops out there making some Levi's, you know?
3163862	3165723	So it's like, well, whatever, you know?
3165723	3167104	One way or the other, right?
3167104	3168385	It's all... It's fine.
3168385	3169466	No one cares, right?
3169466	3169907	We're good.
3171175	3172036	I can't.
3172036	3176301	Bobby in chat says this response is in response to a GDC talk.
3176301	3179184	Well, somebody was dragging Roblox at GDC.
3179184	3180166	Maybe it needed to happen.
3180922	3182183	Yeah, probably should have.
3182183	3182963	Yeah.
3182963	3191909	Especially when, you know, Roblox is trying to position themselves as this platform to make, you know, as Fortnite does a very similar thing, to be fair.
3191909	3200055	I mean, it's very the platforms are very different, but Fortnite wants you to make, you know, experiences and things that exist within the Fortnite world as well.
3200055	3207299	They did have a PR rep step in later on, so that the vast majority of people that are earning money on Roblox are over 18, just
3209921	3212002	Not all of them are children.
3212002	3215843	Uh, Bobby also says that's just an explanation why they had this detailed response.
3215843	3216343	Yes.
3216343	3229086	So they have between the time GDC happened a couple of weeks ago and now to have that meeting to again, how are we going to justify what we do to taking money from children?
3229086	3230787	Yeah.
3230787	3234148	So great.
3234148	3234388	Great.
3236590	3238731	Anyway, let's move on.
3238731	3247054	Let's talk about a growing trend, I guess you could say, in the industry, which is funny horror games.
3247054	3250496	Now, I do play scary games occasionally.
3250496	3256939	I don't know a lot about these types of games, admittedly, but I've watched people stream them, and I can never figure out what's going on.
3256939	3259380	DarkSakura, maybe you've watched people play Lethal Company?
3260321	3264512	Um, which I have it's not like my company.
3264512	3265174	It's fun.
3265174	3266357	Is it funny, Loki?
3267580	3268561	Is it funny?
3268561	3269902	Uh, yeah, can be.
3269902	3272104	Like the monsters are kind of silly sometimes.
3272104	3283014	Yeah, because apparently these games are doing well because they use comedy as a way to, you know, make the scares, you know, make it, I guess, maybe feel a little bit more safe.
3283014	3285897	We could look at games such as Lollipop Chainsaw.
3285897	3289660	We could look at movies such as Shaun of the Dead, American Psycho, Scream.
3290441	3291441	It's a little bit different.
3291441	3297503	I would say like, so Lethal Company, it's funny because of the personalities that play it.
3297503	3300224	It's a very kind of cheap looking game.
3300224	3307407	And it's just, you know, when you're playing it, like you're probably going to die.
3307407	3309648	It's very likely that you're going to die.
3309648	3310708	It's a part of the game.
3310708	3312389	I mean, it's in the title, obviously.
3312389	3318451	It's like playing the role play Call of Cthulhu, where your end goal is just to die the most glorious death you possibly can.
3320270	3333499	Well, another game that's very similar, Content Warning, to kind of put a pin in this, Content Warning did very well during its first 24 hours of launch, and that's because they were giving it away for free.
3333499	3335580	It was a free-to-play launch day on April 1st.
3335580	3336420	I love landfall games.
3336420	3337221	They're great.
3337921	3340962	6 million Steam downloads, 200,000 concurrent players
3355726	3365889	So yeah, you can buy it now if you want for $8, whatever that translates to in your region, but about $8 is what that counts as.
3365889	3368369	So they're talking about though, they're going to fix some bugs.
3368369	3370450	I guess there was some voice chat issues and so forth.
3370450	3374951	But apparently, it's doing very well because it is similar to Lethal Company.
3375331	3375812	DarkSakura
3391083	3392624	Landfall Games are great.
3392624	3395947	I've loved this company for a while now.
3395947	3397748	Ever since ClusterTruck.
3397748	3406254	So they had ClusterTruck, they did Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, they had the Totally Accurate Battle Royale, which is pretty funny.
3406254	3415040	There's another free-running, along the lines of ClusterTruck as well.
3415040	3416941	They're just a great indie company.
3416941	3417502	Worth checking out.
3418462	3419163	All right.
3419163	3421344	Did you pick up this new game?
3421344	3422425	I haven't yet.
3422425	3427048	But you know me, I stack my- You'll add it to your backlog.
3427048	3428249	There's so much there.
3428249	3436155	Like I, the other day I was going through my Humble Bundle stuff and like I have so many hundreds of games I haven't redeemed yet.
3436155	3438417	Like it's just it's ridiculous.
3438417	3439577	All right.
3439577	3440658	Let's get to our next story.
3440658	3444481	DarkSakura.
3444481	3445722	You're muted on Discord just so you know.
3447947	3472183	I don't even recall having even hit the button so at any rate it's a it's a little sad but probably a time as the executive producer of the Dragon Quest series Miyake Yu has decided to step down and we've already got some thoughts about who's gonna take over but
3473764	3481627	But basically, he's going to go to Squenix's smartphone games as head of that.
3481627	3492912	And so, yeah, we're going to see who's going to be next, but one of the people that they're thinking of is going to be Saito Yosuke, who did the NieR series.
3493832	3495253	So who knows?
3495253	3503677	He also was a producer on Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age and Dragon Quest X Online.
3503677	3506299	So who knows?
3506299	3507879	Be interesting to see what comes.
3507879	3516224	I hope this isn't tacky, but I can't help but think of the recent passing of Toriyama and wondering if some of that plays into this.
3518563	3547060	um I mean we don't know but it's it's just like it's it's kind of hard for me not to go like well with Toriyama just recently having passed away and you know so much that went into you know the character design and so forth this seems just very oddly timed I don't know if this is something where it's like we want to pass the baton at this point or maybe you know it could just be an it could be the right opportunity came up I understand sometimes the right opportunity for a new job I don't think it's related at all yeah I just couldn't help but I was like this does seem
3547620	3549421	very soon after all of that.
3549421	3550381	So I don't know.
3550381	3558745	These these sort of corporate decisions, though, they usually go through like a lot of decision making process.
3558745	3559566	Yeah.
3559566	3566149	And so I I would think that that the two were would have to be unrelated.
3566149	3567890	But I mean, I'm willing to be wrong.
3567890	3568690	Yeah.
3568690	3570231	On this anyway.
3570231	3574393	But I don't I don't think that it's that it's related.
3574824	3578667	going to be very curious to see what happens with Dragon Quest.
3578667	3581409	What are we on now 12 at this point, it's just Dragon Quest 11.
3581409	3585492	I feel like it's been years since we've had a new Dragon Quest game, honestly.
3585492	3588514	I mean, I know they kind of like re released 10 in Japan.
3588514	3592457	But I mean, that does shit for fuck for us here in the US.
3592457	3595199	We don't have Dragon Quest 10 or an offline version or any of that.
3595199	3599082	I thought for sure the offline Dragon Quest 10 was the way they were going to finally bring it out over here.
3600723	3612349	Miyake has been working since Dragon Quest V in the capacity, so, you know, I would imagine that maybe he might even be looking forward to doing something different.
3612349	3620633	Quest Buster is pointing out Yuji Naka also threw some shade at Yu Miyake, saying that he had submitted lies at his trial.
3620633	3621734	Oh, really?
3621734	3623855	Drama.
3623855	3624195	All right.
3624195	3625636	I'll save that drama for your llama.
3626131	3633802	Ah, well, speaking of drama, there's a lot of it in this next story from kind of a surprising place, I have to admit, which is what makes this so interesting, Loki.
3634562	3658022	Yeah, so, I mean, we talk about crunch all the time, but one company that probably didn't expect it from is from the developers of the Life is Strange, True Colors, and Before the Storm, Deck Nine Games, who was covered by an IGN report where they talked to current and former employees alleging the studio was a toxic place to work at.
3658022	3662466	And, of course, there was crunch and poor leadership.
3663186	3678051	So basically they said that all the females that they spoke to were subjected to harassment in the company, that the
3679091	3699575	there was a kind of, they were folks claiming, you know, or I guess, having in inappropriate relationships with women, calling the Black Lives Matter movement, a hate movement, getting hung up on different political ideologies.
3699575	3704016	You know, that kind of stuff.
3704016	3706137	You know, I also trash things.
3708010	3717779	Yeah, and then we have crunch, you know, so they were saying that there's, you know, that essentially there is tighter, tight deadlines and small budgets.
3717779	3720361	So there is a crunch culture there.
3720361	3731972	And saying that they were deck nine, of course, is defending their self saying they were committed to champion diversity and telling stories from historically underrepresented groups.
3731972	3733413	Yeah, they all say that.
3734678	3735759	Thank you for watching!
3747694	3764501	This studio making this game that is kind of a very well-known sort of like queer representation kind of franchise that gets a lot of awards, those types of visibility sorts of awards and representation, just to hear that
3764901	3776626	I mean, it just goes to show, you know, kind of going all the way back to when, you know, in the earlier days of COVID lockdowns, when this was first being brought to light, that this was going on at places like Activision, Blizzard, and so forth.
3776626	3783909	You know, I think a lot of us kind of slowly became more and more aware that these are issues that are deeply rooted in the industry.
3784369	3787571	They're just exacerbated by what's going on at Activision Blizzard and so forth.
3787571	3789612	But these are these are industry problems.
3789612	3794835	These are problems that, you know, lie in the deepest, darkest corners of a lot of these places.
3794835	3802640	And now to see that it's happening, even at a studio that's making a game that stands for things that are quite the opposite of that.
3802640	3805262	And I know everything is alleged and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3805262	3806563	But let's be real.
3806563	3810105	When multiple people have been interviewed and multiple people's accounts are collaborating,
3812008	3813470	ZachGurus
3829910	3832332	who was apparently the point of conflict.
3832332	3845618	And they were saying that aside from all the stuff about BLM and all that, that there even ended up being, I guess, Nazi imagery hidden within the Life is Strange title as well.
3845618	3848039	Yeah, gross, gross, gross, gross.
3848039	3849559	And, you know, also,
3852020	3854141	Let's see here.
3854141	3859225	Of course he defended himself saying that he didn't recall making those comments.
3859225	3860926	And of course not.
3860926	3864368	And I don't recall is like one of the worst defenses.
3864368	3867751	I'm sorry.
3867751	3868111	I don't know.
3869111	3872253	Game industry being game industry.
3892335	3894518	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3908035	3910437	I just want to say, fuck you, you fucking fuck.
3910437	3921248	Like, these are problems that are very deep rooted in the industry that unfortunately are coming to light through stories like this, which is very, very disappointing.
3921248	3927154	But I agree with what, you know, is being said in chat, as Joan Hunter-Matt says, and you wonder why more studios are unionizing.
3927774	3933196	If they're all for protecting their employees moving forward, then support them when they decide to unionize.
3933196	3934776	Absolutely.
3934776	3935736	Absolutely.
3935736	3942318	So it's it's very disappointing to hear about this happening anywhere in the industry.
3942318	3948460	But you know, knowing that this studio has taken home awards, but I I have to remind myself
3950390	3959638	It's, it's, it's, there's a lot of people that work there that have nothing to do with any of this and do believe in a lot of that stuff that the game is representing.
3959638	3974309	I have to remind myself that probably there's plenty more people and it's just unfortunately a few people with power that are now tarnishing this studio's name and this story this week, which I think is very important.
3974309	3975731	And Questbuster does want to point out
3976598	3979080	that we do have different studios here.
3979080	3984065	Dotnod Studios did Life is Strange 1 and 2, but it was passed on to new ownership.
3984065	3987528	And this is, you know, True Colors that we're talking about specifically after they were done.
3987528	3995675	Still, I do believe if I'm not mistaken, True Colors still itself won many of these types of awards from what I recall.
3995675	3998058	So, you know, and yeah.
3998837	4001019	Yeah, obviously we want to make sure it's the right studio.
4001019	4005963	But at the same time, my other point is, I would bet the vast majority of people at the studio were not the problem.
4005963	4008485	And I think that's something important to keep in the back of our minds.
4008485	4016051	It was a certain person or people in power that did this shit.
4016051	4020274	Off with their heads, metaphorically.
4020274	4021355	I don't want to get banned from Twitch.
4021355	4022976	I don't want to get banned from Twitch.
4022976	4024998	So yes, I'm sure metaphorically, of course.
4024998	4025978	That's what I always mean.
4025978	4027419	What I always mean.
4027419	4027700	All right.
4030478	4041361	Moving on, let's talk about, oh boy, let's talk about a studio that's just, this game is just becoming the biggest joke of the year, I'm sorry to say, but it's of course Suicide Squad.
4041361	4044921	I probably didn't even have to tell you what the game was before you already knew what I'm talking about.
4044921	4054424	But yes, if we talk about Suicide Squad for a moment, this of course being that live service game that now has a hacker problem.
4054424	4059905	Hackers have figured out how to gain access to unreleased characters and skins.
4061052	4062433	So you know what that means.
4062433	4065135	They're already in the game.
4065135	4067597	And they just want to pay you to be able to access those things.
4067597	4068238	I agree.
4068238	4069339	Good.
4069339	4070380	Good.
4070380	4079467	This is the type of lesson that executives, I don't want to say studios, because again, most of the people that worked on this game, probably very hardworking, good people.
4079467	4082230	Executives that make these type of shitty calls, good.
4083117	4084938	Good, I'm glad it happened.
4084938	4095883	I've been watching the reviews for all of the Season 1 content pack that they have, and it's all recycled stuff from the game.
4095883	4105767	Even the fight against Brainiac is another re-skinned boss battle, just like they did in the finale of the game, which is lazy as it is already.
4107948	4118719	And it's just like such a grind fest to do anything in the game because they're trying to get you to pay to unlock a character in this $70 game already.
4118719	4119519	It's just bad.
4119519	4120821	Like this game is just like...
4122855	4124116	is is the best example.
4124116	4130582	If you actually bought this game, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna shame because you know, you probably had high expectations.
4130582	4131883	But abandon ship.
4131883	4133264	It's time to abandon ship.
4133264	4142412	You want to get out you want to see a fun time go go look at the Suicide Squad game subreddit where people are just like, Listen, I'm sick of this.
4142412	4143032	I'm done.
4143032	4150919	Like I tried to hold out hope for this stuff, but like, clear that they're not going to do anything that like they are just
4151599	4159515	regurgitating garbage just to try to get... Which reddit is this on?
4159515	4162061	It's the SuicideSquadGame subreddit.
4163544	4166587	We have a moment because DarkSakura is AFK and she's going to do the next segment.
4166587	4167088	So why not?
4167088	4169350	I want to see what this is all about.
4169350	4170731	Hold on.
4170731	4173254	Yeah, it's I think it's a suicide.
4173254	4175496	I think it's Suicide Squad game, if I remember correctly.
4175496	4177818	Suicide Squad gaming, I think might be.
4177818	4180060	I just I just game.
4180060	4180901	No, I did.
4180901	4184004	I did a search and I think I found it here.
4184004	4186147	So if we actually look at Suicide Squad gaming,
4186747	4191591	So yeah, am I the only one who genuinely enjoys everything in this game?
4191591	4196995	After all this grind, I finally got him.
4196995	4197315	I don't know.
4197315	4199837	I don't see a lot of people dogging on this.
4199837	4201379	It's probably not that one.
4201379	4203340	It's not the right subreddit.
4203340	4205282	OK, I'll try Suicide Squad Game.
4205282	4207964	Let me see.
4207964	4209185	Oh, Suicide Squad The Game?
4210325	4211166	Maybe, yeah.
4211166	4214410	Oh, well, that's locked private now, so we can't get into that one.
4214410	4217354	So, yeah, I don't know.
4217354	4219496	Play a Suicide Squad game?
4219496	4220878	Anyway, whatever.
4220878	4223962	I don't remember, but yeah, there's quite a few.
4223962	4225083	I suddenly stopped here.
4225083	4227065	I thought this segment would go somewhere more fun.
4227065	4228347	I apologize to all the listeners.
4231372	4260282	uh i swear there was another one though because i i was looking at it um anyway well let me tell you though the the hackers did uh discover how to play as deathstroke who is one of the characters that's teased for an upcoming season uh and now that hacker is the top player on the game's leaderboard so if you log in and check the rankings there you go you can see it right in front of everybody uh also apparently accessible skins for the joker king shark have been accessed uh and of course that stuff is circulating around reddit and
4260422	4266406	and wish.com's Lex Luthor's website throughout this last week.
4266406	4268287	So, there you go.
4270006	4274289	Oh, this particular news article links to a post.
4274289	4277191	I think this is the same Reddit subreddit I was looking at.
4277191	4280073	But yeah, losing interest quickly.
4280073	4281755	There's only two comments on this.
4281755	4282315	So I don't know.
4282315	4296905	But anyway, no, the one I was looking at was it was like there was a lot of posts on there like they were just like, you know, there was a couple people defending but they're like, I you know, I can't do this anymore type of thing.
4296905	4298046	Yeah.
4298046	4298987	I'm trying to find it.
4299839	4305323	stupid browser doesn't remember which it's, it's not a big deal.
4305323	4307805	We don't need to be yet another.
4307805	4311949	Well, I don't really consider ourselves press or more commentary and that sort of thing.
4311949	4317813	But we don't need to be yet another press thing that's writing articles based on Reddit.
4317813	4320775	There's enough competition in that space right now, which is every other website.
4320775	4320895	So
4321716	4327284	Anyway, um, but what we can do is get to a new segment that is completely our own.
4327284	4331931	Well, not a new segment, but our next segment that we've been doing for a very long time that is completely our own.
4331931	4333594	So let's roll the bumper.
4344355	4352123	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4352123	4354987	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4354987	4359091	But once a month, DarkSakura in the year 2024 now focuses on a
4361013	4362934	cancelled game.
4362934	4368437	So this is a classic game that you never got to play because it was cancelled.
4368437	4371139	DarkSakura, this one really fucking hurts.
4371139	4373000	So yeah, I kind of hate you.
4373000	4375261	But I also love you for acknowledging it.
4375261	4375881	Let's get to it.
4375881	4377642	What is the- Another one that cancelled it.
4377642	4378883	I know you're not.
4378883	4379623	Let's get to it.
4379623	4381384	And let's roll what footage we have.
4381384	4384706	What is the classic cancelled game of the week?
4385766	4388348	Mega Man Universe.
4388348	4394452	It was a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer set in the Mega Man series.
4394452	4399175	It was being developed by Capcom for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
4399175	4412864	It was mostly based off of Mega Man 2, but you could make your own levels, customize your characters, and it would have also been the first game in the whole series to be called Mega Man in Japan instead of Rockman.
4416126	4432835	It had like rendered levels and CG characters but played in that same sort of side-scrolling, you know, version of it.
4432835	4435697	You can make your own levels.
4435697	4439639	You place your platformer, obstacles, enemies, stuff.
4439639	4442340	You could share your levels online.
4442340	4443521	Hello, Mario Maker.
4444842	4455072	You could customize your Mega Man with different exchangeable parts and chips that give him different attributes, like jumping height, weapons he could use.
4455072	4463260	And then the game had different versions of Mega Man, including the North American Nest Box.
4465343	4474977	and some of the other Capcom property characters like Gideon from Street Fighter, Arthur from Ghosts'n Goblins and they had some DLC on the line.
4474977	4478222	So the game started production in March 2010
4480144	4486588	And there was a trademark registered by Capcom on April 27th, 2010.
4486588	4489549	Another reason why I chose this for April.
4489549	4496013	On July 16th, a stop-motion teaser was created by IM8Bit here in the U.S.
4496013	4499555	that had MegaMan, Ryu, and Arthur.
4499555	4503377	And Inafune, we all know Inafune Keiji.
4504657	4505718	I'm going to read the quote.
4505718	4514681	We wanted to preserve as much as we can of the classic 8-bit Mega Man feel while allowing players to project their own Mega Man into the game.
4514681	4524765	There were gameplay trailers out as of September 2, 2010, and then afterwards they revealed the level editor and customization.
4524765	4531387	There were other trailers for the game and had music by a cover band called The Megas.
4534028	4537790	There were a lot of different folks working on this.
4537790	4545034	It was produced by Ito Akiko, who wanted feedback on what the fans wanted to see in the game.
4545034	4549716	And so, after four months though, when Hune left,
4554238	4568421	Christian Svensson said that despite their silence on the game's development, it wasn't cancelled, but had some setbacks because of criticism and unresponsive controls.
4568421	4579123	We've got the final word though on March 31st, 2011, that Capcom officially cancelled the game due to, quote, various circumstances.
4580144	4581327	And so that's it.
4581327	4588307	We had some trailers and we had some ideas and that's about it.
4590353	4591453	which was sad.
4591453	4598136	I'm gonna I'm gonna admit the one I mean, the original trailer was like super badass that we had for the game, right?
4598136	4601357	Like it like, like showed everything in motion was really cool.
4601357	4602657	You know, the concept.
4602657	4603357	That was great.
4603357	4609360	But then, you know, when that kind of second teaser came out, and I'm gonna for those that are watching on Twitch Live, I'll play it again.
4609360	4611400	So you kind of see this footage here.
4611400	4612661	When I'm looking at this footage,
4613721	4617023	I kind of get Mega Man PC vibes.
4617023	4624907	I don't know what it is, but it doesn't seem to like snap the way a lot of Mega Man games do it.
4624907	4631770	This this feels like somebody doing a PC like custom Mega Man game is what it looks like.
4631770	4634231	I mean, I guess it would be another to kind of get in there and play it.
4634231	4636393	So but the concept was so good.
4636393	4640915	I feel like the execution may not have been what we were going to think it was, which
4641215	4641956	Which is great!
4641956	4648802	Now we have Mega Man Maker, which is independently made, but is basically this, but better, and plays like Mega Man.
4648802	4655648	And then, if we want a computer, like a PC Mega Man that sorta looks like this, but plays like Mega Man, then you have, you know, Mega Man with a...
4658437	4672460	S219 Matt says, I actually played this at Digital Life many, many years ago.
4672460	4675660	It really did play what, like what Mario Maker would be.
4675660	4680461	It wasn't like our traditional Mega Man game, kind of felt like a mobile-ish port.
4680461	4683802	Yeah, now, now we're getting into that.
4683802	4685122	I mean, I think that's,
4686002	4711248	I think this was also supposed to be like a didn't they did have like what was it a was it a PSP or Vita type of game that was there was a Mega Man maker type game that was on there I thought or maybe it was something like this too I don't remember but there was something that was Mega Man powered up Mega Man that's what it was so there was that which I think
4712475	4713596	I remember that, I do remember that.
4728868	4741215	Well, I will point out my other choice was Maverick Hunter, which was a first-person shooter game in the franchise that was to be developed by Armature Studio.
4741215	4743216	It was extreme!
4743216	4749580	Yeah, it was actually an attempt by Ina Hune.
4749580	4756984	Well, he was responsible for trying to re-establish the Western versions of the game.
4757544	4776673	And actually, the character design I thought was cool was by Adi Granov, who did a lot of cards for Magic the Gathering and some Dragonlance and some of the earlier, I'd say like 80s era D&D artwork.
4776673	4786457	And his wife was Julie Bell, who also is an artist in her own right and was his, a lot of times, his physical model for a lot of female people he drew.
4787558	4793639	He saw Bomberman X-Series and he's like, I want more of that.
4793639	4800381	But yeah, I went for something that I think would have been a little bit more universal.
4800381	4801641	See, that's it.
4801641	4808882	Powered up Megaman looks awesome.
4808882	4811743	So, that was it for the Classic Game.
4812389	4812849	All right.
4812849	4815912	Sorry, I've been talking to the mic on mute while I had this rolling.
4815912	4816132	Sorry.
4816132	4821076	But for those watching on Twitch, I actually have the footage, as you mentioned, from Mega Man Powered Up playing.
4821076	4827341	And it actually kind of does look like what you would expect Mega Man on a mobile platform to look like a little bit, you know, on a PlayStation.
4827341	4829182	Yeah, it is cute.
4829182	4832085	So, yeah, I think a re-release on this would be cute.
4832085	4833826	I want to say it was on a mobile platform.
4833826	4836828	I think Mega Man Powered Up Mega Man was on.
4836828	4838970	All right.
4839542	4844467	Well, let us move on and talk about some other headlines happening in the industry real quick.
4844467	4847270	So Loki, we'll go to you for some rapid fire news.
4847270	4848311	It was only PSP.
4848311	4849332	That's interesting.
4849332	4861003	Anyways, so there is a, a, I guess, poll done by BAFTA Games, talking about the most iconic video game characters of all time.
4861003	4862464	And who won?
4862464	4863125	Lorecroft.
4864543	4865625	Mario, Agent 47, Sonic the Hedgehog
4880623	4883284	I feel like there's a few campaigns that were going on here.
4883284	4886664	And I, I don't want to say like, oh, Lara Croft didn't deserve it.
4886664	4888065	I understand she's iconic.
4888065	4889065	No, she's iconic.
4889065	4901327	Yeah, it is a little surprising over Mario or Link or, you know, some of the other Sonic, some of the other, you know, iconic characters we've had in gaming over the years.
4901327	4905368	I would say it's a bit surprising, but when I'm British, I can see that too.
4905368	4906188	Yeah.
4906188	4908389	So yeah, it's interesting.
4910085	4928174	And then the fan game formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, now stripped of the Bloodborne coat of paint on it, is now coming out as Nightmare Kart, releasing free on Steam and itch.io on May 31st.
4928174	4937779	And it's going to have 20 racers, 16 maps, legally distinct, full campaign mode with boss fights, and versus battle mode.
4938659	4940723	Uh, I love that.
4940723	4941825	Legally distinct.
4941825	4943408	That's right.
4943408	4944991	Nightmare cart for free.
4944991	4946233	Love that price.
4946233	4948276	That's a great price.
4948276	4949018	Uh, DarkSakura.
4950353	4952714	You and I both have some pinball headlines.
4952714	4954135	We do, we do.
4954135	4965301	So there are new titles coming out for Pinball FX, some universal pinball TV classics coming out on May 16th this year.
4965301	4975206	There is going to be Xena, Warrior Princess, who is going to be fighting Callisto, Ares, and Caesar with
4975806	4977267	Nightrider Pinballs.
4977267	4979588	You can use Kits technology and go against Karr.
4998254	5002977	and have Turbo Boost and Super Pursuit Mode and all those things were in Knight Rider.
5002977	5005319	I was so obsessed with Knight Rider in third grade.
5005319	5006900	Okay, I'm gonna leave that there.
5006900	5009802	Battlestar Galactica Pinball!
5009802	5013265	You have to stop the Cylons.
5013265	5013745	Yay.
5015555	5017217	and Remember Old OLR Jokes
5035466	5035987	Thanks for watching!
5050185	5052086	DarkSakura said hey Rob
5070632	5074197	Oh, no, actually, she sent text and went, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
5074197	5075278	No, she actually didn't do that.
5075278	5078162	But she said, Hey, Rob, ABBA pinball.
5078162	5081105	And I said, Oh, no, I said, Is it virtual?
5081105	5082207	Or is it real?
5082207	5083668	She put real.
5083668	5085210	And my response?
5085210	5085511	Fuck.
5087472	5088033	and Abba Pinball!
5104867	5108430	Pinball Brothers is the pinball manufacturer making this.
5108430	5109971	There will be two variants.
5109971	5117517	There's going to be the regular version and the Arrival limited edition, Arrival being one of their albums that they were very famous for in the 70s.
5117517	5122280	There's also a Voyage, their newest album, collector edition version.
5122280	5127744	800 units, 300 collectors editions, 500 limited editions.
5127744	5132268	I guess the regular ones will be as many as they need to make, but the other ones will be more limited.
5133809	5140471	Abba songs will be in there as well as a arrival helicopter that is fully interactive happening there.
5140471	5143652	So that's what they were teasing it with the helicopter.
5143652	5144952	Yep.
5144952	5146973	There will be a 50th anniversary.
5146973	5152914	I'm sorry, this is all in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the date that Abba won the Eurovision Song Contest.
5152914	5153635	But you know what it is?
5155196	5157981	One of their kids is a big pinball fan.
5157981	5163552	I think it's one of Bjorn's kids is a big pinball fan and kind of helped to broker this deal, if you will.
5163552	5166518	So here's the thing, you want to know how much this table costs?
5168068	5175849	$10,000 for the Arrival Limited Edition, $11,000 for the Voyage Collector's Edition.
5175849	5186171	And many people have been asking me, many people meaning DarkSakura and Bobby have been asking me, am I planning on picking up this table?
5186171	5190612	And the answer is, I literally can't.
5190612	5194653	I would literally be divorced if I were to spend this kind of money on a pinball table.
5195453	5195533	I'm
5225592	5227354	Bobby Black Oven Chat says My Rush Limited Edition was $11,000
5241516	5249640	Yeah, those prices are really unsurprising, especially for one as deluxe as that looks to be.
5249640	5250281	Yeah.
5250281	5255344	Like, well, you know how much our Weird Al would have originally cost us.
5255344	5259686	But we were also getting a P3.
5259686	5260286	Expensive.
5260286	5262688	I mean, those tables are the ones you can kind of flip out, right?
5263839	5271905	Our Black Knight Sword of Rage, I mean, when we bought just the top or four, that was like, I think, on like a major sales in the late three grand.
5271905	5272526	Wow.
5272526	5274047	So.
5274047	5274767	All right.
5274767	5283654	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some more budget friendly game releases that are having even $70 looks great in comparison to $10,000.
5283654	5288778	Let's talk about some more budget friendly releases we have coming out real soon as we travel the world and check out some release dates.
5288778	5289018	Loki.
5289980	5298664	Yeah, not a whole lot this week, but we've got Botany Manor on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5298664	5301325	Children of the Sun on PC.
5301325	5310309	Gigantic Rampage Edition on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5310309	5311609	That's it.
5311609	5312109	It's April.
5312109	5312970	What do you expect?
5313908	5323516	Yeah, definitely the release calendar has slowed down a little bit this time of year, but we will travel to Japan anyway, and I'll tell you the things you can look forward to over there.
5323516	5331623	On the Nintendo Switch, there is a game called Slave Zero X that is coming out in a regular and limited edition from a company called Beep Japan.
5331623	5334465	Can't make this stuff up.
5334465	5335326	I think I know that series.
5337586	5338826	Utakata no Uchronia Broccoli
5364552	5369674	Um, let's see Hatsumira from the Future Undying also releases in Japan this week.
5369674	5372215	RPG Maker With.
5372215	5372995	With what?
5372995	5376436	I don't know, but that is it's called RPG Maker With.
5376436	5378277	That is the name of it.
5378277	5383759	And this is apparently a new feature called asset sharing that allows you to create games together.
5383759	5384319	That's kind of neat.
5384319	5389041	That is actually going to be really freaking cool for collaborative.
5389041	5391922	I mean, there's a lot of good RPGs out there that were made in RPG Maker.
5392242	5399966	Yeah, so the fact that this is available on the Switch and I'm sure I'm sure a PC version of this is not is happening somewhere.
5399966	5401146	It's just not on my list right now.
5401146	5402167	So pretty cool.
5402167	5403147	Yeah.
5403147	5403568	Um, let's see.
5403568	5404828	What else do we have?
5404828	5408150	The Dragonists, Command of the Flame, also out in Japan this week.
5408150	5412892	And Steins Gate Elite gets a price reduction as it goes into a good value addition.
5412892	5414793	Again, all of that on the Nintendo Switch.
5414793	5416774	So still pretty busy in Japan this week.
5416774	5417975	I didn't even do PlayStation 5 yet.
5418655	5420076	but it's very similar.
5420076	5428383	That same Slave Zero X game is out as well as the Dragoness, Command of the Flame, both on the PlayStation 5 this week on the 11th as well.
5428383	5429284	How about Europe, DarkSakura?
5430810	5432812	In Europe, just a handful of things.
5432812	5437275	On the 9th, for PlayStation, we have Pacific Drive Deluxe Edition.
5437275	5444179	On the 11th, for PCs, we have a Fallout S-B-E-C-I-A-L Anthology.
5444179	5447882	On the 12th, for PlayStation, we have Mixture.
5447882	5455046	And also on the 12th, for PlayStation, we have the Talos Principle 2 Devolver Deluxe.
5455046	5455387	That's it.
5456773	5469257	We have a few more stories for you and then we'll get to our listener roundtable where we invite your emails at participate at orangeandreda.com as well as your calls if you want to join us in our live chat.
5469257	5472798	Discord, I'm sorry, our Discord is VOG Network.
5472798	5477920	I almost said discord.com, but that's how you get the client to find us, but it's vognetwork.com.
5478801	5483724	If you're in the green room, we will be taking calls tonight.
5483724	5485686	I will warn folks.
5485686	5487847	I expect we're going to have a lot of calls next.
5487847	5490329	We don't get a lot of calls usually on this show.
5490329	5495653	I expect we're going to have a few next week just because of, you know, the fact that it's episode 1000.
5495653	5498455	I cannot guarantee we will get to all the calls next week.
5498455	5505781	So I do not want people to feel personally offended, but there will be a time where we have to end the show because we still all have lives to go to the next day.
5505781	5507522	So I just want to kind of put that out there.
5508082	5510203	Just so nobody is surprised.
5510203	5516926	One other interesting housekeeping thing I need to say at some point during tonight's show, and then we'll get back into news.
5516926	5523609	I don't think this is going to affect very many people at all, but it will affect somebody, and I'll get an email about it if I don't say something about it.
5523609	5534354	For the last 999 episodes, when this file is put out on the feed, it actually has the episode number embedded into the podcast metadata.
5535382	5545968	So it actually knows what episode number this is because that's in the, or the, it's the track number, but it's, it's what we put in there as the podcast number in there.
5545968	5550431	After tonight's episode, I will no longer be able to, well, there's one of two things I can do.
5551553	5554615	And I'd be curious to hear from the people that actually use this.
5554615	5557276	I can either leave it blank because here's the thing.
5557276	5559158	It, it, and you probably guessed it.
5559158	5561179	It only holds three digits.
5561179	5572506	You can't go past 999 and you can't put letters in there because Jason suggested I do 1K1 and I was like, well, that'll only get me to 1009, but, um, so you can't do letters.
5572506	5574447	So literally there's two options.
5574447	5577949	Number one, I don't fill it out anymore, which is what I'm leading towards right now.
5577949	5580851	Number two, we roll the odometer over.
5581531	5583994	And we start back at zero.
5583994	5588299	I don't even know if it will hold zero, but we start back at zero next week.
5588299	5590161	And then one, two, three after that.
5590161	5596508	So from the people that actually give a shit about the podcast metadata, I would love to hear from you.
5596508	5597369	What do you want?
5597369	5599151	Because tonight's it.
5599151	5601133	There will be no more episode numbers after tonight.
5602094	5603795	unless I implement one of these.
5603795	5607238	Can we do like 999 and then plus one or something?
5607238	5609300	No, it only holds three characters.
5609300	5610160	There will not.
5610160	5612962	The title will be fine.
5612962	5616025	So like when you see it in your feeds, it will still be episode 1000 feet.
5616025	5620248	This is only the tags embedded in the file metadata.
5620248	5626953	We become the one that makes it necessary for them to change the entire system.
5626953	5631537	I will place a phone call to Tim Apple right now requesting that iTunes extend that field.
5633849	5641394	Um, now I, I actually thought of SSJ 100 Matt suggestion in chat who says Roman numerals.
5641394	5643156	I actually thought of that.
5643156	5643736	They're letters.
5643736	5644196	That's right.
5644196	5644877	They're letters.
5644877	5645898	So you can't do that.
5645898	5648780	And you're still only limited to three characters.
5648780	5654444	And usually even a number like 15 is going to or 18 is going to be XVIII.
5654444	5657146	So there's not enough spaces.
5658300	5661961	again, Tigerclaw letters only you can't do star one.
5661961	5665063	So as far as I see it, you got two options.
5665063	5669905	I get rid of it or the odometer rolls over and next week is episode zero if it even takes a zero.
5669905	5671345	I don't know if it takes a zero.
5671345	5672946	Yeah, but then that's gonna mess it up though, too.
5672946	5677088	If you know, you know, you get double numbers for like certain items.
5677088	5683070	But you know what, we just maybe we just borrow an old tagline from our old friends economy and just say we are starting over.
5685407	5688409	This is the show that never ends.
5688409	5692832	It just goes on and on, my friends.
5692832	5697736	Somebody started it not knowing when it stops.
5697736	5701278	And we keep doing it just because.
5701278	5705581	Lurch noises.
5705581	5706902	Lurch noises.
5706902	5708223	All right.
5708223	5708564	Anyhow.
5709574	5710894	Let's move on.
5710894	5712615	We have a few other headlines for you.
5712615	5717456	Because I've got a great story tonight on how we're all getting older, just in time for our thousandth episode.
5717456	5721677	But first, Loki with an interesting headline here.
5721677	5730139	So coming from the Russian newspaper, Kommersant, apparently,
5731407	5749510	Vladimir Putin wants to jump into the video game wars himself with his own Russian-built console to compete against the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. And to share the Russian propaganda.
5752931	5760556	There was orders handed down from the Kremlin to consider the issue of organizing the production of stationary and portable game consoles.
5763350	5767331	Portable game consoles and game consoles.
5767331	5784194	That sounds weirdly worded there, but, um, essentially from, from the per, per the, um, the paper itself said there's, there's no competence to produce their own, uh, PlayStation, Xbox consoles and create such a system from scratch.
5784194	5785815	We'll take up to 10 years.
5785815	5786475	Yep.
5786475	5787775	I mean, you can't just go woof.
5788504	5791585	Why don't we get that man who made Tetris?
5791585	5793846	He lives in America now.
5793846	5796007	Shit.
5796007	5798268	So good luck with that.
5798268	5801730	He'll be hopefully dead by then.
5801730	5808393	Anyways, this I feel like this device is probably going to be about as good as a Nintendo V. Do you remember the V?
5809838	5810998	I've heard the V, yeah.
5833126	5837227	But otherwise, you can look up the Nontendo or whatever this company was called.
5837227	5840008	The V, which is a complete rip off.
5840008	5846910	And I feel like and I get it because, you know, all these companies pulled out of Russia after the Ukraine invasion.
5846910	5847111	Right.
5847111	5850492	Well, this was I think this was in China where they essentially.
5850492	5851952	No, the V was the V was.
5851952	5852592	But yeah.
5852592	5853072	Yeah.
5853072	5860115	But I'm saying this Russia thing that's handed down is because all these other gaming companies pulled out of Russia after the Ukraine invasion.
5860115	5860575	I mean,
5862617	5874929	Not to give advice to like, you know, dictators or anything, but like, if you're gonna go the route of making your own console, we can really, you know,
5876426	5884790	I think that we really need to take a page out of one of the greatest console manufacturers on the planet.
5884790	5885230	Oh, no.
5885230	5886250	What is he going to say?
5886250	5887631	Soldier Boy.
5887631	5888051	Oh, God.
5888051	5899116	So we need to really follow Soldier Boy's example here and just, you know, grab something off AliExpress and just, you know, rebrand, rebrand.
5899116	5900136	And you're there you go.
5900136	5903137	You got your console right away.
5903137	5904298	No, no R&D needed.
5908973	5910275	How about... Okay.
5920097	5928060	From that story to our last story tonight, where we look at a very special anniversary happening in gaming this week.
5928060	5932762	It actually happened a few days ago, so you probably saw some lines crossing your social media feed.
5932762	5938645	But as of April 2nd, five days ago, Final Fantasy VI turned 30 years old.
5941466	5948170	Of course, this was... You are old, you're very old, oldie.
5948170	5951751	I bet your hairs are gray.
5951751	5953852	Hey, that's not funny.
5953852	5957794	I'm going to be older soon.
5957794	5958615	Guess what?
5958615	5960356	We all are getting older.
5960356	5963317	Hey, no, but I'm going to have another number.
5963317	5966799	You are older right now than you were at the beginning of the show.
5966799	5968060	Hey, guess what?
5968060	5968580	No shit.
5972096	5980707	I've been, I don't know, kind of having pre-birthday blues, so that makes me feel even older.
5980707	5985954	Oh hey, sorry to jump back to a previous topic here.
5985954	5988717	So I just saw that in tags they have season number?
5989636	5990797	Could that possibly work?
5990797	5992879	We had season two episodes.
5992879	5994000	I'll have to look.
5994000	5997304	I didn't see that there, but maybe I'll look that up.
5997304	6002369	First time first time chatter in our chat room, Martello4 says, Bitch, I'm looking finest wine.
6002369	6009596	Well, you know, you can you can you can pay a lot of money to have have Botox injections and those sorts of things.
6009596	6010357	Oh, my God.
6010357	6010697	Y'all.
6010697	6011998	Do you want to know something, Rob?
6011998	6012178	What?
6012879	6015621	I may be getting Botox injections anyway.
6015621	6017683	Well, there are like headaches.
6017683	6020285	Yes, there are medical uses.
6020285	6026930	They use Botox for it, because, you know, I I don't work in health care anymore, so I feel a little more comfortably talking about this.
6026930	6028872	I used to work in health care and they will do Botox.
6028872	6029072	Yes.
6029072	6030253	For headaches is the number one.
6030253	6031093	They can also do it.
6031093	6034256	They do it for people that have excessive sweating underarms.
6034256	6034516	Yeah.
6034516	6038800	Is the place because it it stops the I mean, I do I do watch.
6039520	6042362	My Dr. Lee, my Dr. Pimple Popper.
6042362	6049625	Well, Botox, literally the word, it's botulism toxin.
6049625	6051206	It's literally a toxin.
6051206	6058390	Anyway, what I wanted to say is I saw this woman this week with the most botched Botox I've ever seen in my life.
6058390	6064874	Like her lips were not, her doctor was not kind or she went somewhere unlicensed.
6064874	6067155	It was in the lips.
6068055	6069436	Final Fantasy VI turned 30 this week.
6088306	6091207	And of course, a lot of people are very happy to remember this.
6091207	6097869	All of us here in the US, we probably remember this as Final Fantasy III because this was back when Square called them by different numbers and all of this.
6097869	6116915	I'm kind of curious what y'all's memories of Final Fantasy III, playing that, we'll call it that for now, the Super Nintendo cartridge, what your memories of playing that was since, you know, I know we're all in our 40s at this point, you know, going back 30 years, we were, you know, of varying ages and either grade school, high school, whatever, depending where we're at.
6117875	6122278	Uh, and, uh, well, I remember I loved Final Fantasy 2.
6122278	6124679	That was one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.
6124679	6128061	I didn't I wasn't able to get Final Fantasy 3 right when it came out, right?
6128061	6131323	Because my parents, like, weren't going to drop that because the cartridges were expensive.
6131323	6133164	I would say this cartridge was like 80 bucks.
6133164	6133865	It was expensive.
6133865	6135045	Yeah, something like that.
6135045	6137827	I just I rented it and took off a week of school.
6137827	6139308	So cool.
6139308	6146632	My friend in high school had this, and I remember we went to a sleepover at his house and we were playing this game all night and he was at the point in the game
6146932	6147473	Edgar and Saban
6160936	6172742	That's why I love, so in Final Fantasy XIV, one of the classes in that game, the machinist, is very inspired by Edgar from Final Fantasy VI, and that he actually has the bioblaster, the chainsaw.
6172742	6179026	I mean, they're different because it's XIV, it has to be balanced, but it's really cool that it's inspired by all of that.
6179026	6180767	I love how that looks, so.
6181047	6184968	I remember sitting on the floor in front of our old console style CRT screen.
6197273	6216642	writing down the lyrics so I would remember what they were and screaming at the TV quite a bit and then just letting the music in, not Figaro, but letting Cyan's music play.
6216642	6220264	Because I really, really love that music.
6220264	6223825	Of course, later on, you know, I did the same thing with Chrono Trigger in Zeal.
6227284	6229324	I love that.
6229324	6242167	Quest Buster in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network brings up a really excellent part of Final Fantasy 3 that everybody I think remembers the first time they saw this the opera scene of Final Fantasy 3 still sticks with me to this day.
6242167	6245308	And yeah, absolutely my god.
6245308	6252550	That opera scene I feel like was almost like revolutionary in some ways of storytelling and video games like it really, really was.
6253581	6255863	Do you think they'll ever remake 6 like they did 7?
6255863	6257244	Uh, no.
6257244	6259325	I hope so, it would be cool though.
6259325	6260326	No, I don't think they will.
6260326	6263068	There was, they did the pixel remaster.
6263068	6265930	Yeah, the pixel remaster is surprisingly decent.
6265930	6267051	Yeah.
6267051	6273036	I was also pointing out, they also did the one that had like, I guess the chibi body remake style.
6273036	6274257	Yeah.
6274257	6275758	The handhelds.
6276118	6279920	Yeah, I didn't like the first mobile release was garbage.
6279920	6281381	I didn't like it.
6281381	6288445	But the pixel remasters are great, especially now that, you know, they're on PlayStation, PC, you know, wherever you want to pick it up, except Xbox.
6288445	6289385	Sorry.
6289385	6290185	You can.
6290185	6292247	Those pixel remasters are really good.
6292247	6297469	I just also remember there being bored and like, can I suplex the train?
6297469	6298930	And I could suplex the train.
6298930	6300031	And my mind was blown.
6300031	6300471	That's right.
6301775	6306276	So I can't believe this game is 30 years old, but there it is.
6306276	6306936	Hey, think of it.
6306936	6308617	Think about this.
6308617	6313698	When this show started.
6313698	6318239	That game was eight years old.
6318239	6321220	When this show started, that game was eight years old.
6321220	6324160	Now it's 30 years old.
6324160	6325020	Just food for thought.
6330586	6332510	What else does this game and I have in common?
6332510	6333192	We age well.
6336087	6336968	That's how you sell it.
6336968	6337708	All right.
6337708	6339029	Let's get to our listener round table.
6339029	6341270	We want to answer your questions in our chat room.
6341270	6346973	We also welcome your phone calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room and your emails.
6346973	6348114	We get your emails occasionally.
6348114	6352036	And I really, especially, you know, we're hitting a big landmark milestone next week with episode 1000.
6352036	6355778	I would really love to hear from y'all next week.
6355778	6358960	And if DarkSakura's voice starts to give out, I will read emails too.
6358960	6359881	I'm happy to do it.
6359881	6364584	I would, it would really mean a lot to us to hear from some of you, even if you just want to say hi and sign your name, that's fine.
6364584	6365164	I'd appreciate it.
6365444	6368208	But I think we have at least one email tonight, right?
6368208	6368990	Yeah, just one.
6368990	6369150	Okay.
6369150	6369951	I'll go ahead and read it.
6369951	6370372	Yes, please.
6371730	6380474	Dear Orange Lounge Radio team, I'm writing to extend my heartfelt congratulations on reaching a monumental milestone, your 2,000th episode.

6395761	6400063	Reaching 2,000 episodes is a testament to your... I'm reading it like this for a reason.
6400683	6407167	Reading 2,000 episodes is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and loyal audience you've built.
6407167	6423638	I personally enjoyed Skye's deft helming of the ship that is the show, DarkSakura's never-suffering fools lightly, and Loki's frequent exasperations with Nintendo, and appreciate the informative and entertaining content you provide.
6423638	6425099	Congratulations once again.
6425099	6427861	Here's to many more successful episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
6427861	6429202	Best regards, Red Entertainment.
6429642	6431782	This message was brought to you by Google Gemini.
6431782	6432443	Yes, really.
6432443	6437004	I asked Google Gemini to write an email to Orange Lounge Radio congratulating them on episode 2000.
6437004	6440264	And yes, I know it's 1000, but I made a typo and ran with it.
6440264	6442725	Enjoy.
6442725	6445505	OK, I don't want to see any more goddamn A.I.
6445505	6446285	emails.
6446285	6448026	That's number one.
6448026	6450086	Look, don't have A.I.
6450086	6451466	generate the email.
6451466	6451907	Write it.
6451907	6453247	We want to hear it in your own words.
6453247	6453747	If you want to
6454966	6457147	If you need a template or something, then fine.
6457147	6459729	Or give me an idea what it should look like, then fine.
6459729	6461029	But please make sure the voice is your own.
6461029	6464691	I want to know how it picked all of this stuff from us.
6464691	6473016	Oh, if you go and ask, like, if you go to, like, I can't even just do this right now because I was actually checking earlier.
6474036	6478399	Yeah, well, I wasn't using ChatGP, but like Microsoft kind of has their own thing now, right?
6478399	6487345	So I actually had looked, I was doing longest running video game podcast earlier, and it actually runs this little AI thing on the side here.
6487345	6491548	And it actually says one of the longest running video game podcasts is Orange Lounge Radio.
6491548	6496311	It still says we're 18 years, but I know that's because it was in the podcast description that way for a long time.
6496311	6501174	But here we are hosted by DarkSakura, my old name Sky, but Rob Roberts is there, Loki.
6501174	6501975	We cover all this.
6501975	6503316	We won a podcast award.
6503316	6503716	It actually,
6504356	6506859	It's- Oh, how dare you, ChatGTP!
6506859	6510202	It's pretty much all this- What did ChatGTP tell you was a different show?
6510202	6511543	Giant Bombcast.
6511543	6514045	Oh, that's what- That's what Google says it is, too.
6514045	6514806	Well, they're liars.
6514806	6518149	Well, my- So, Microsoft Copilot's the winner, to be honest.
6518149	6521952	So... There it is.
6521952	6522993	Oops.
6522993	6523874	I switched to the wrong screen.
6523874	6525436	I'm gonna fix this right the fuck now.
6525436	6525616	Okay.
6525616	6527678	Are you- Are you reporting?
6527678	6527878	Error.
6528857	6529917	Aha!
6529917	6532498	I said Orange Lounge Radio is older than Giant Bombcast.
6532498	6534018	You are correct.
6534018	6538279	Orange Lounge Radio is indeed an older podcast compared to the Giant Bombcast.
6538279	6546701	Orange Lounge Radio started in April 2002, making it one of the longest-running podcasts in the gaming community.
6546701	6552462	It focuses on video games and related topics and has been consistently producing episodes for many years.
6552462	6554922	Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
6554922	6556363	You are fucking welcome, ChadGTV.
6559966	6563768	Do not forget it.
6563768	6564449	I won't forget.
6564449	6567751	That's what I just said.
6567751	6568471	I'm saving this.
6568471	6572434	This is great.
6572434	6574115	They started theirs 10 years later.
6574115	6577777	So their podcast started April 2012.
6577777	6583621	I didn't ask the question, what is the longest running podcast that people actually know about?
6583621	6587083	I said, what is the longest running podcast on video games?
6587563	6589265	SSJ100 Matt says if you send haikus you get bonus kudos.
6589265	6590025	Yes, I would agree with that.
6590025	6591126	Podculture suggests AI haikus.
6591126	6592728	I take chocolate if you want to send me chocolate.
6608354	6610275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6636112	6645277	Somebody shows you how to hack those systems to run a bootleg online thing, which I'm sure will be coming around at some point.
6645277	6648899	Bobby Blackwolf wants to point out, be careful using ChatGPT.
6648899	6651820	Be very vigilant with ChatGPT doing Python scripts.
6651820	6654161	It hallucinates packages that don't exist.
6654161	6657863	And some people have actually created those packages with malware.
6657863	6659324	I am very careful.
6659324	6664867	I go through and basically just run it for functionality before I plug it in to run on my Mac.
6664867	6665107	Smart.
6667288	6673372	SGO100Mad is going to send off the 3DS, I'm assuming, with some Mario Kart later.
6673372	6683858	Because if you're going to play Mario Kart on the Wii U, I mean, they remade that for Switch anyway, so... Anyway, I guess that's it.
6683858	6685440	We don't have a lot of other questions.
6685440	6687301	That was our last email.
6687301	6688842	And I don't see anybody in the green room.
6688842	6689122	That was it.
6689122	6692504	Our only email.
6692504	6693585	Alas.
6693585	6694565	Until next week.
6694565	6695066	Next week.
6696172	6697553	Kind of a big deal.
6697553	6698353	It's episode 1000.
6698353	6707477	Thanks to all of you out there who have listened, whether tonight was your first night or you've been listening for a very long time.
6707477	6709317	Again, thank you all so much for being a part of it.
6709317	6713859	It's you guys showing up here week after week that gives us the incentive to do this.
6715940	6718061	And you know, it doesn't take a lot of people.
6718061	6719161	It's certainly not.
6719161	6722842	We don't have as many listeners as, um, what was the show the chat should be?
6722842	6723382	Bombcast?
6723382	6724563	Giant Bombcast.
6724563	6730224	We don't have that many listeners, but we love those of you that do show up and y'all make this worth it.
6730224	6731005	999 times over.
6733185	6743248	And it's because of you all that we're hitting such a huge landmark, really historic and unprecedented milestone next week of 1,000 episodes.
6743248	6751450	The only other gaming shows that have hit 1,000 episodes do it because they've... And I don't want to diminish anyone's accomplishments.
6751450	6752591	I'm not here to do that.
6752591	6753791	That's fantastic.
6753791	6760413	But, you know, we are the first to do a weekly release show that hits 1,000 episodes, and that's a huge...
6760993	6763935	Huge milestone for us and I'm very excited for it.
6763935	6766777	So it's enough of a milestone to make me look at my life choices.
6766777	6767517	Yeah.
6767517	6769599	Yeah.
6769599	6771280	No, it's it's a great ride.
6771280	6772100	It really is.
6772100	6774982	I'm I'm I'm digging in a weird way.
6774982	6780426	I mean, maybe some of this talk should be saved for next week, but in a weird way, I feel like I've learned a lot.
6780426	6780806	Yeah.
6780806	6782167	Yeah.
6782167	6786750	And remember, the most important thing is the friends we make along the way, which is true.
6786750	6786810	No.
6789833	6790494	It's accurate.
6790494	6794677	Well, it's and it's not just you and Matt, which is, of course, an important part of that.
6794677	6800901	But like the cool thing is, and people have commented on this, it's like you go to a city and you know people there already.
6800901	6807026	Like when I go to New York, it might just be a couple of people I meet up with, like Matt, YYR, Ranma.
6807026	6810449	But it's like I know people in New York because of the show.
6810449	6813391	I know people in other cities and other conventions I go to.
6813391	6816433	When I went to MAGFest in D.C., I ran into people because of the show.
6816433	6818355	When I went to Chicago, I know people because of the show.
6818795	6822256	When we go to John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza, we run into people.
6822256	6827857	Yeah, it's like, you know, kind of having those connections literally around the world is incredible.
6827857	6842601	I remember going to visit my mom and my family and then going into Pensacola for like a DDR thing that my friend was doing and there being people like, oh my God, hi, we listened to you.
6842601	6843822	And I'm like, oh my God, hi.
6845223	6846786	And it was an experience.
6846786	6847907	Yeah, very humbling thing.
6847907	6848328	Yeah.
6848328	6852274	I remember when we were waiting in line for the Wii and somebody was listening to our show.
6852274	6852455	Yeah.
6852455	6852775	Yeah.
6856175	6862156	That was, well, me and, wait, for the, yeah, me and Chris were, were waiting.
6862156	6863596	Yeah.
6863596	6865317	And then we bribed everyone with donuts.
6865317	6866177	Yeah.
6866177	6868037	Good times.
6868037	6868797	Memories.
6868797	6874818	We'll do more reminiscing next week, but I did just want to say, you know, this is, this is the last triple digit episode of OLR.
6874818	6878079	Uh, that's been, so the first one would have been episode 100.
6878079	6881859	So it's been about 20 years worth of triple digit episodes.
6881859	6884880	And starting next week, it's going to be, we literally broke
6885720	6896568	the system by getting I guess I should I guess I should call some of the other shows that have gotten to a thousand episodes and ask like, what did you do about the metadata?
6896568	6897789	We don't give a shit about that.
6897789	6898789	Oh, probably.
6898789	6899570	Anyway.
6899570	6900391	All right.
6900391	6903533	Also, also, funny thing.
6903533	6906775	If you add nine plus nine plus nine, it equals 27.
6906775	6909097	And if you add two plus seven, it's nine.
6910482	6912803	Yeah, any multiple of 9 will add up to 9.
6912803	6914203	You can keep doing that.
6914203	6918144	Keep adding all the digits over and over and over again until you eventually get to 9.
6918144	6920705	We are the 9est 9 that ever 9ed.
6920705	6924046	If you add 9 and 9... Except for me, I'm a 10.
6924046	6931048	If you add 9 and 9 and 9, you get 27, which is the age I like to lie to people and say I am.
6931048	6931748	Okay.
6931748	6934169	Or you can be 29, like Bobby Blackwolf.
6935560	6939345	We can be like, listen up, 90s.
6939345	6944552	A thousand is talking.
6944552	6946214	Listen, listen up, tens.
6946214	6948177	You podcast in your tens of episodes.
6948177	6949018	Listen up, tens.
6949018	6950059	A thousand is speaking.
6950942	6951402	I love that.
6951402	6952243	That's funny.
6952243	6957827	But no, like I said earlier, again, I'm never here to diminish anyone else's achievements.
6957827	6963912	And I think any podcast that gets to 10 episodes, quite frankly, is a huge accomplishment.
6963912	6967815	It's a testament to our level of boredom, everyone.
6970140	6974703	If you're bored enough, you too can have a thousand episodes every, you know, after weeks.
6974703	6982689	Well, DarkSakura, the answer I always give, what has kept you motivated throughout 900- Spite.
6982689	6984270	Spite.
6984270	6984810	Spite.
6984810	6986051	Spite.
6986051	6987712	Spite.
6987712	6989453	Everything I do is motivated by spite.
6989453	6991755	Well, most everything.
6991755	6996858	And on that note, DarkSakura, I know you're going to go do your thing in Dead by Daylight.
6996858	6999200	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
7000615	7004456	Rejects false icons and come spend my birthday with me.
7004456	7005896	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
7005896	7007177	It's coming up.
7007177	7007677	All right.
7007677	7008397	It's coming up.
7008397	7009857	We'll see in a little bit.
7009857	7011357	We'll see in a little bit.
7011357	7012718	Later taters!
7012718	7016739	Before I turn it over to Loki, of course, I want to thank everybody for listening to this episode.
7016739	7024601	As always, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Dawn Radio, please help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7024601	7025421	So tell a friend or two.
7026621	7033869	Tag some folks on social media that may not know we're getting to a thousand episodes and let them know because it is kind of a neat thing.
7033869	7035912	So help us spread the word.
7035912	7040277	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we want more voices put out on air.
7040277	7041418	We want a thousand voices.
7041818	7049186	Next week for our show, but you know what I'll take 40 to be quite honest live if that's what we can get But I appreciate it.
7049186	7050347	It's not really about the numbers.
7050347	7054511	It's about All of you and the great vibes here every week.
7054511	7057595	So thank you so much Okay, now that I got that out Loki your final thought tonight
7058875	7065140	Uh, my final thought is I was just checking, you know, because we were talking about like, hey, does podcasting get to 10 episodes or whatever?
7065140	7070643	Our channel 64 chats, which is now on Spotify, is reached episode 13.
7070643	7072405	Oh, for real?
7072405	7073385	I didn't even know that was a thing.
7073385	7074166	Is that you're on that?
7075163	7081025	Yeah, I'm on that because we we do chats every month or so.
7081025	7086848	So it's under Spotify is CH64 chats is what it's listed as.
7086848	7087208	Nice.
7087208	7088909	We talk about Minecraft stuff.
7088909	7089249	Oh boy.
7090066	7092407	Alright, sounds good.
7092407	7093507	My final thought tonight.
7093507	7094647	I don't have a lot.
7094647	7098469	I'm just, you know, again, I'm just feeling I'm feeling really good about this accomplishment.
7098469	7100309	We're kind of staring down right now.
7100309	7103790	And again, I just want to thank everybody who's ever kind of joined along for the ride.
7103790	7105291	I really appreciate it.
7105291	7108092	And yeah, don't stare directly into the sun tomorrow.
7109172	7111933	Um, and hopefully when the eclipse happens, you know what?
7111933	7117655	Some people are saying that the solar eclipse is going to be the end of the world because you know, they say everything's gonna be the fucking end of the world.
7117655	7119076	They said that the last time.
7119076	7120056	Here's the thing.
7120056	7127819	With the luck I've had in my life, the week we're scheduled to hit 1000 episodes would be the week that the world ends.
7127819	7131961	So if the world does end tomorrow during the eclipse, don't stare directly in the sun.
7131961	7135282	Don't be like a former president and stare directly into the sun.
7135282	7137223	I just want to say it was really lovely knowing you all.
7141107	7143908	Yeah, you can't stare into the sun because cool guys don't look at explosions.
7143908	7146089	So, you know, right.
7146089	7146670	Bye, everybody.
7146670	7151452	We will see you next week for episode number 1000.
7151452	7153193	Good night.
