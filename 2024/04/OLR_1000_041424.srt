1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:02,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hi, we're here.

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:09,818
[SPEAKER_10]: It's episode 1000 of Orange Sounds Radio tonight, which is pretty wild to think about.

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:19,849
[SPEAKER_10]: But we thought, yeah, we thought for this special occasion, we would, well, first, we're together in person for the first time since COVID happened, actually, which is

4
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:23,430
[SPEAKER_10]: All of us, yeah, which is pretty wild to think about.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's been a real treat.

6
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:37,356
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually thought we would kind of do the special opening tonight at the diner that's right over there that is surprisingly still open after... We all met, what, like 24 years ago?

7
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We met all that time ago, and it's wild that that's still open.

8
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:42,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Golfland's still open, which is really the place where we met.

9
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:21,572
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it but it's also kind of like interestingly I guess poetic in a way that like all these places are still going and here we are still going uh this time later I don't know it's it's neat to think about but things change they don't have cheese sticks anymore no mozzarella sticks no what the heck no and there's no DDR machines or probably anything that doesn't spit out tickets in there at all

10
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:27,256
[SPEAKER_10]: No, if you want to see that, you're going to go to round one on the other side of the freeway at this point.

11
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,097
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the good stuff is.

12
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:30,878
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the newfangled stuff.

13
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:37,023
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be like the new podcasts about DDR and that sort of thing that probably have no idea we exist.

14
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:37,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's fine.

15
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:43,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in our days, we went to Gothland to play the deeters.

16
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:46,690
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the senior citizens of gaming podcasting at this point.

17
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you still?

18
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So on tonight's show obviously we'll talk a lot about you know just

19
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:43,485
[SPEAKER_10]: how it feels to be a thousand years old or whatever we're celebrating tonight um but let me let me ask this question to kind of start us off at the top one thousand episodes in from june 2002 hi oh you should have been filming this the whole time okay look look alternate angle a thousand episode in a thousand episodes in some things don't change we're still making it up as we go along um

20
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:51,948
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the secret to longevity with a podcast?

21
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:52,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Fake it.

22
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:53,808
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

23
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was gonna say 1,000 episodes in.

24
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just ask this right at the top.

25
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,090
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it feel?

26
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,711
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it feel from June to now?

27
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:04,191
[SPEAKER_10]: June 2002 to now?

28
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:04,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

29
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:13,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the chat room is saying get a tripod, I don't want to hear it.

30
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to hear it, look.

31
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:32,335
[SPEAKER_10]: At a lot of different like panels about podcasting and things at Dragon Call and stuff, people are like, oh, we got to have the right equipment.

32
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,837
[SPEAKER_10]: What equipment do you need to podcast?

33
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:34,718
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you need to do?

34
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,499
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need anything.

35
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:37,580
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a phone.

36
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,282
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a phone and a dream.

37
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:44,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And if this doesn't show that, if nothing else, all you need is a phone.

38
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:48,611
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a tin can microphone from RadioShack because they were still around in 2002 and a dream.

39
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot I have lavalier mics that go with iPhones.

40
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:53,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

41
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:54,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

42
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:56,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

43
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Tangents, they're inevitable.

44
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:59,979
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it feel?

45
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:00,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go to you then, Loki.

46
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,021
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it feel, 1,000 episodes?

47
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels exactly the same.

48
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

49
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:13,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to think about time like that because we hit all these different milestones that seem kind of ridiculous and now it's just part of our life.

50
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It is literally getting to the point now, we're almost past, where I have been doing this show more

51
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

52
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, look at this show now.

53
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:46,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just discovered them because they've hit a thousand episodes.

54
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:47,575
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it's fine.

55
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:48,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be just our community.

56
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:51,798
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a thousand podcasts putting out their first episode this week.

57
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:54,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And it can be a real struggle to kind of stand out sometimes.

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,441
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's what it is, right?

59
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

60
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,863
[SPEAKER_10]: We're fortunate to have the group that we have.

61
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:05,487
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm pretty sure we're going to have a nice, solid chat show up tonight for the show.

62
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:08,949
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a lot of faces that we've seen throughout the last few months.

63
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Travis, thank you for having me on Under Sedation a lot.

64
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:18,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes you can wear a bra on your head and call yourself Queen Amidala.

65
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:41,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say this show just simply doesn't exist if not for Jason.

66
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:54,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I think our voiceover guy Jason, I don't think many of you understand from a technical, support, financial, oftentimes, and all that stuff perspective how Jason has really helped keep this show afloat.

67
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:57,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwell

68
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,705
[SPEAKER_10]: the first time.

69
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:34,737
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, our long history from Live365 to where we're at now on Twitch, Bobby kind of saved us from pulling the plug when Live365 was no longer a viable option for us.

70
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:38,059
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and then that's... Which is, by the way, Live365 is still there.

71
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,321
[SPEAKER_10]: They are, but it's a different thing now.

72
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:46,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but I just think it's funny speaking of the things before that were still... It's like LiveJournal's still there, but it's not really LiveJournal.

73
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:46,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

74
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have a permanent

75
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

76
00:06:49,627 --> 00:07:04,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is even outside of just like, or that's even just like, then the friendship that we have, and you know, just having the whole, as he puts it, opening act, which, you know, we don't really see it the same way, but we see it as co-headlining, but all these years.

77
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously Bobby's been instrumental in that.

78
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:11,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's, God, there's so many other people, like on a personal level.

79
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:13,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm always worried about thanking people, because I'm gonna leave people out.

80
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, people.

81
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

82
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:27,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you're watching this, seriously, or listening to this, thanks, because it's really everybody showing up to the table that has kept us.

83
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:31,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to remember to do thank you and not this way, because this means bitch.

84
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not calling y'all bitches, I'm saying thank you.

85
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:38,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, yeah, thanks for being a part of our lives for the last 21 years.

86
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:38,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

87
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:42,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for letting us be a part of yours, even if it's for a few hours.

88
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:43,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

89
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:51,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, with that, I guess we will start the official intro to episode number 1,000.

90
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:54,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much metal for one hand?

91
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:55,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That's us.

92
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Two hands.

93
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:56,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Two hands.

94
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:56,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Split it up.

95
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:57,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Two hands.

96
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Two hands.

97
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,663
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're too much metal for one hand.

98
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of like that, we're like that.

99
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:03,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll the intro.

100
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,912
[SPEAKER_11]: The Pretendo Group is breathing new life into the Wii U's online capabilities with nothing but a DNS change.

101
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:26,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm stuck in the middle of my gaming fandom enjoyment of this reveal, my awe of the technical elegance, but my concern for any possible future ramifications.

102
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:31,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I've successfully buried the lead because this is the 1,000th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

103
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:35,717
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to talk about that.

104
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:39,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on this show's 1,000th episode.

105
00:08:43,510 --> 00:09:09,444

[SPEAKER_10]: It does.

113
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Literally this episode is going to 11.

114
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:56,260
[SPEAKER_10]: That is how you celebrate a thousand episodes is you just turn it up even louder.

117
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:12,475
[SPEAKER_10]: For those that are listening on the podcast feed, DarkSakura has put her VTuber in the bin for tonight and has put on her best drag to be here for you all live in person.

118
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:15,198
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not my best drag, but it's suitable.

119
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,098
[SPEAKER_10]: You look lovely.

120
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

121
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:23,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that means I can go back to terrorizing everybody with doing weird stuff on cam.

122
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:25,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Just remember, the podcasters are still here.

123
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:26,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We love our podcast crowd too.

124
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we love you.

125
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:33,151
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but I still like to play with the camera.

126
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm here.

127
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:37,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll catch up a little more in just a minute.

128
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:45,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say hello as well, of course, to the one and only playing with the camera with games in his background as we're streaming live here on Twitch.

129
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

130
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:47,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

131
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, how are you Loki?

132
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing pretty good.

133
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,061
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this game behind you tonight?

134
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't recognize it.

135
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:54,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gotta be a pun on 1000 somehow.

136
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not a pun on 1000.

137
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:00,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a brand new game that just came out.

138
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:03,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the video game adaptation of Turbo Kid.

139
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:07,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So Turbo Kid is kind of like a cult classic.

140
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: post apocalyptic kind of 80s style movie.

141
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:18,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And this game kind of takes place after the events of that movie.

142
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:22,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a great metroidvania game that I will talk about a little bit more later.

143
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:24,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I was getting metroidvania vibes from it.

144
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,229
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I love me a metroidvania.

145
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:27,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, that's great.

146
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you have some friends in chat tonight.

147
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,993
[SPEAKER_10]: You must have put up on your YouTube channel.

148
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:39,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello to all of you in chat, what a great turnout and again, we're all blushing all sorts of colors here with the hype train you have going.

149
00:11:50,238 --> 00:12:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: uh money to keep ourselves a legit business and all that but thanks to the generosity of you all it's it's very little out of pocket we have to do to do that so it helps us helps us do the show for free uh which we love to do we've loved to do this for every week for the last thousand weeks and um we're gonna keep it going tonight um i hope you all enjoyed uh our little reminiscing intro tonight we really did go out to golf land today uh we were originally going to record that at the diner

150
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:27,597
[SPEAKER_10]: But silly me in planning this whole thing kind of forgot like, oh, it's Sunday after church brunch crowd.

151
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:32,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It was packed and very, very noisy when we used to go after golf land nights.

152
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very quiet in there because we were usually the only ones in there that late.

153
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:37,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was a very different vibe today.

154
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:38,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So oops.

155
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had to mix it up a little bit.

156
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:43,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So but I hope you enjoy a special intro tonight.

157
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:45,656
[SPEAKER_10]: And hello to all of you in chat.

158
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:46,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave a shout out.

159
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:47,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

160
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:51,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Arrington20 says Loki fan club lol Yes, got the shout out for that.

161
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:55,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Missingno1115 says love you guys been listening for 15 years.

162
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:59,978
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't I don't feel old at all tonight.

163
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:00,718
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I love that.

164
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:01,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

165
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:03,559
[SPEAKER_10]: No, y'all making me blush.

166
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I some of you have been listening for a very long time.

167
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:16,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's really a testament to you all that have helped us get this far by being here and supporting and giving us things to talk about and making it so that we're not just talking to ourselves.

168
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:20,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like to think we would have a lot of fun with the show if we were talking to ourselves.

169
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:23,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that opening tonight was just us talking to ourselves.

170
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:23,425
[SPEAKER_10]: But

171
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:28,387
[SPEAKER_10]: This show is just that much more elevated because you are all here and you're a part of it.

172
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:31,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just I can't thank you enough.

173
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:32,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

174
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:40,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So usually at the top of the show, we would do a kickoff topic talking about something going on in video games.

175
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:48,357
[SPEAKER_10]: But since, you know, the news this week would be this is, you know, not to toot our own horn too much, but you know what?

176
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:49,018
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn it.

177
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:52,099
[SPEAKER_10]: After 1000 episodes to fucking toot.

178
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,340
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the news.

179
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,277
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a historical thing.

180
00:13:57,277 --> 00:14:02,781
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the first podcast to hit 1000 weekly episodes.

181
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:08,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there's, you know, and again, I've said this a million times, there's other people that count the numbers differently and do all these things.

182
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:11,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm never here to crap on anybody else and the accomplishments.

183
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:17,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite honestly, if you have put out five episodes of a podcast, you've done an incredible fucking thing that not a lot of people do.

184
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm never here to poop on anyone else's accomplishments.

185
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:25,961
[SPEAKER_10]: There's lots of great, you know, accomplishments things have done and measured in different ways.

186
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's great.

187
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:36,810
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, for us, having done this in an era before podcasting, really continue a merging it into podcasting before iTunes was in the game.

188
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:42,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And now to where we're at now is just, yeah, it's, it's, it's been a hell of a run.

189
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought we'd take some time at the beginning of the show to

190
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,399
[SPEAKER_10]: answer a few questions, panel style.

191
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,381
[SPEAKER_10]: You know I love me a panel at a fan convention.

192
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be at DragonCon, Labor Day weekend, by the way.

193
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope to see you there.

194
00:14:54,923 --> 00:15:02,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll answer a few questions about this show and what it means to be at 1,000 episodes.

195
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:05,970
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you want to add some in chat, I'll try to catch some in chat.

196
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,851
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of you in there tonight.

197
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:11,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad you all... Oh, that's a fancy animated emoji everybody got tonight for the hype train.

198
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,994
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

199
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:13,154
[SPEAKER_10]: So

200
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:17,177
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have other questions, we'll try to get to as many as we can.

201
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:29,264
[SPEAKER_10]: But here are a few submitted online, submitted, just asking me personally about it or texting me, or yeah, me begging people ask us a question for tonight, and so forth.

202
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:32,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Here are some questions to jump in.

203
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:37,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first question tonight, here on one on episode 1000.

204
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:41,992
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you go back and change about episode one?

205
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything you'd go back and change about episode one?

206
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I'll start with you.

207
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:50,485
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you go back and change about episode one?

208
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:54,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could have had some better mics, but I mean, that's fine.

209
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the first episode and we're on dial up at that point.

210
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it wouldn't really matter.

211
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it just wouldn't.

212
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,430
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't change anything.

213
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe more chairs.

214
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I would change one thing.

215
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,152
[SPEAKER_03]: We could get some more chairs.

216
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,092
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what would you change?

217
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:14,221
[SPEAKER_07]: The freaking migraine I had through the first episode.

218
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

219
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:18,484
[SPEAKER_07]: My head was a wreck.

220
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:21,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, it was it was cool to do.

221
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,809
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like ours.

222
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:24,770
[SPEAKER_07]: It was our thing.

223
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:33,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we we we said we're we're going to to produce this spawn of our brains.

224
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And and it was good.

225
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the vibe of a clusterfuck, but it was good.

226
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:51,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like the vibe of the first episode because it was kind of like, it would be like recording a podcast in the middle of like a party kind of environment almost, or nerd party, if you will.

227
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:55,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was just like that in the first couple years.

228
00:16:55,172 --> 00:17:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, honestly, yeah, it was it was just like, people coming over hanging out playing, you know, music games and stuff like that.

229
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And just

230
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: people sliding in and out of like, hey, I got something to say on the mic.

231
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say something.

232
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let's talk about this.

233
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:21,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's you know, it it was just kind of very casual, you know, and very informal, kind of a really fun vibe before I think the first few episodes, our first few years, actually.

234
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're completely professional.

235
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:27,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that's behind us, of course.

236
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was a lot of fun.

237
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:30,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's interesting.

238
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,000
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple answers I would have for this.

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:48,593
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a part of me that almost wishes the early episodes had a little more structure, but I also feel like the complete and utter lack of structure was kind of what made it special and what made it a lot of fun and had that atmosphere.

240
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:54,859
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, the language differences in the year 2002.

241
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:59,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I know we went back, I think when we hit our 19th anniversary, we went back and listened to episode one.

242
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And we honestly thought it would be a lot worse.

243
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:06,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think I caught the R slur in there, which, you know, language has changed.

244
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:10,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and you know, there's been awareness and advocation and so forth.

245
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:13,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously some of that is regrettable.

246
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,718
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, it's it is an artifact of the year 2002.

247
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:20,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so some of that I wish was different.

248
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:26,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It is it isn't it doesn't age well, but I also recognize we didn't we didn't know better now we do.

249
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:46,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and it was also like, yeah, there are some things that I think, jokes that we, we kind of took, like, kind of the whole, um, oh, uh, Cards Against Humanity type of humor, you know, and thought that was kind of cool for a lot of, like, some of the jokes that we made on there, but it isn't always that funny.

250
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,515
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of stupid things you do and say in your 20s.

251
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:50,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how it is.

252
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:32,919
[SPEAKER_10]: find find me I can't go back and change anything so somebody who's perfect there's gonna be things that shows that start today there's gonna be things that for shows that start today that look back in 20 years and we go oh that didn't that didn't age well you know that there it's just it's gonna it's gonna happen we can learn from it and we can do better and I hope everybody has found that that has been the case here I hope so we want to create a welcoming environment because everybody or gaming is for everyone period

253
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:37,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And to respond to SSJ100 Matt's, I'll friend your bud.

254
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,271
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't any of us that said that.

255
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:42,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That was from that Seaman video.

256
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was the person who did the Seaman video.

257
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:47,936
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to find them and send them like some cookies.

258
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

259
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:49,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Some, yeah.

260
00:19:49,477 --> 00:19:51,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the material.

261
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,960
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to friend your butt, but we'll give you a cookie.

262
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,701
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't even remember the YouTuber's name.

263
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:59,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe somebody out there knows that I because I really do not know.

264
00:19:59,063 --> 00:19:59,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

265
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,164
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

266
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:11,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the next question, which would be what is the secret to keeping it all going for this long?

267
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what is the secret to keeping it all going for this long?

268
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Habit.

269
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,420
[SPEAKER_07]: My Sunday doesn't feel right without it.

270
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:48,656
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just like doing anything that you find enjoyable, that you, you know, are gratified by, and that you feel connected to other people with, you know, why do people do convention circuits for years?

271
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:49,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Why- Yeah, Ranma.

272
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:54,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do- Well, I wasn't just thinking about- I'm calling him out.

273
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:54,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm calling him out.

274
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,058
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

275
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:56,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing but love.

276
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:58,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Why- Why do-

277
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:05,170
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, why no matter whatever happens, I always go back to do stuff in Mass Effect.

278
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:12,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's kind of just like... Why is Loki's gaming week always fucking Minecraft?

279
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there's certain comfort food.

280
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I only have time for that.

281
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:20,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I play Dead by Daylight?

282
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,854
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at least twice a week.

283
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:24,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I used to play every... Final Fantasy 14, just as bad.

284
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,916
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all guilty of our comfort food games, right?

285
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:29,345
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the thing.

286
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:33,086
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what we do.

287
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:39,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't put an immediate why on it, I guess, or a how.

288
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:43,528
[SPEAKER_07]: We just keep doing it, and we keep trying to do it better.

289
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:48,969
[SPEAKER_07]: But unless somebody wants to just give us a gift of $25,000... That's a pretty good start tonight.

290
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:59,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all are paying the bills for the next couple months, so thank you.

291
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:09,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitch Twitch

292
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:57,955
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this really weird extended family, you know, it kind of is almost like that community feeling I used to get back on AOL back in the day where you had your RP friends and you would always meet in like the town square of Sailor Moon or Kuno's Island or whatever that sparring ring room was.

293
00:22:57,955 --> 00:23:01,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, hang out with, with your friends.

294
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:03,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just our, our weekly hangout.

295
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

296
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,567
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and we talk about video game news because I have something to talk about that isn't food.

297
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, or drag race.

298
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:14,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all like video games for sure.

299
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:17,432
[SPEAKER_10]: But and all those other topics come up too.

300
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I would I would really kind of copy that answer.

301
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Look over your shoulder and write the same thing.

302
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:25,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think habit is a big part of our community.

303
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:37,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It is ironic that our original plan today got blasted out a little bit by the church crowds because I think in some ways this is a very similar thing to church.

304
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:50,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I've made this analogy before, and again, I'm not trying to sound like it's actually religious or spiritual or anything like that, but I think church is a very big habit for a lot of people that is community and all of that.

305
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:52,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying we're a cult?

306
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:54,719
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I am not saying we're a cult.

307
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Ex-exempt status.

308
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

309
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:57,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

310
00:23:57,964 --> 00:23:59,506
[SPEAKER_10]: The Church of OLR.

311
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:06,096
[SPEAKER_10]: This is that thing that people show up to to hear Loki preach about what fucked up thing Nintendo did this week.

312
00:24:07,955 --> 00:24:10,757
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, in all seriousness, like this is this is that community.

313
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:12,178
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still that community.

314
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:12,578
[SPEAKER_10]: It's habit.

315
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:16,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And the habit part is huge, is huge.

316
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:17,962
[SPEAKER_10]: You really do have to prioritize.

317
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:20,344
[SPEAKER_10]: You want the secret to keeping it all going for this long.

318
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:22,025
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to prioritize it.

319
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:27,148
[SPEAKER_10]: The minute you start making excuses for why the show can't happen, the show's going to slip.

320
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:31,852
[SPEAKER_10]: And there have been weeks that we've missed, but we really try to keep that

321
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:33,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Sparing.

322
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:42,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Like even when, and we've all had tragedy, but personally, when my mom passed away, I really worked to get back here after two weeks.

323
00:24:42,937 --> 00:24:56,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not, you know, it's, it's, it's just because I kind of needed OLR as that, like, I need to find my routine again and find normalcy and what doesn't feel normal in that whole situation.

324
00:24:56,823 --> 00:24:57,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

325
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:00,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, God, I mean, like,

326
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:10,964
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all lost people in our lives throughout the show and we've all kind of been here for each other, I think.

327
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:12,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

328
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:15,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've seen people born.

329
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:19,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's got Spawn now, you know, friends of the show.

330
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:20,730
[SPEAKER_10]: When in high school.

331
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:32,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just getting texted pictures of the Mels who were here on episode six, I think, back because Mel B was a huge freestyler in DDR and his wife and I have been BFFs for a long time.

332
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:36,833
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was getting pictures of their daughter, you know, today.

333
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,313
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Melody and I are sort of co-workers right now.

334
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:41,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's small world.

335
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:42,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

336
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:45,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm co-workers with Drew.

337
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:48,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, let me... I need to text his butt and say, get in the chat.

338
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:49,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

339
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:50,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

340
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:50,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and that.

341
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:52,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, BigRedPimp in chat.

342
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:52,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so sorry.

343
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:53,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to ignore chat.

344
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:54,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I am reading.

345
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,380
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of these comments here.

346
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,165
[SPEAKER_10]: BigRedPimp says, you all are to blame for Angel and I getting married somehow.

347
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,147
[SPEAKER_10]: It was you all your fault.

348
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:04,969
[SPEAKER_10]: It is it blow there.

349
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,531
[SPEAKER_10]: There have been relationships because of this show.

350
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:10,594
[SPEAKER_10]: And that blows my fucking mind.

351
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:14,765
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been shows made because of this show.

352
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:17,146
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the ultimate compliment, by the way.

353
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:25,328
[SPEAKER_10]: People that have done their own podcast as a result of what they maybe heard here and thought, just like we learned from Travis Donovan at Under Station Live.

354
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:27,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out if you're out there, Travis.

355
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like we learned from Travis, any idiot podcast that I say that would love.

356
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people have learned that lesson from us.

357
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:36,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't take expensive equipment to do it.

358
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:36,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So

359
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Loki, I didn't let you have a stab at the question.

360
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to make sure you you had a chance.

361
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:44,918
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the secret to keeping it all going for this long?

362
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:48,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Stubborn determination.

363
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:49,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's it.

364
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just is routine.

365
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, I don't know.

366
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the see how long it goes.

367
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I just when I do I do something and then I, I keep doing it until I'm forced not to do it anymore.

368
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:03,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, it's

369
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:05,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what it is.

370
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:06,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that answer too.

371
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:09,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of want to see what happens.

372
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:11,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of want to see what happens.

373
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, next question.

374
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:17,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was via Twitter.

375
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:18,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

376
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Will you be voting for President Kat this election?

377
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:23,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this game.

378
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:30,559
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's funny to me that you know, we haven't made a lot of headway with gaming press with this milestone, which is fine.

379
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't blast everybody with a press release or anything like that.

380
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:40,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, you know, because I think sometimes the lack of exposure is actually kind of nice.

381
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of nice that we don't have a lot of shitbags that come in this chat room.

382
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:57,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And the unfortunate thing is if we were out there large on this big scale where people would, you know, want to find us and try to get a reaction out of us, we'd see a lot more shitbags in chat.

383
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So sometimes being on this kind of like

384
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:07,839
[SPEAKER_10]: hipster underground have you heard of this show kind of level is actually a really cool thing.

385
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are still underground.

386
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's interesting to me that President Cat was the thing.

387
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:20,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And just dumb little Twitter campaign we were running to try to get this game localized and brought to the USA actually ended up getting more press than anything else.

388
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:23,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that was pretty funny though.

389
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:23,653
[SPEAKER_10]: It was funny.

390
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,254
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really funny.

391
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:36,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but it, and I also feel it's like the earliest form, not that we were the first, but it was the earliest form of that whole Reddit article or Reddit post becomes a story that every other game blog posts about.

392
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:42,324
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, Bobby Blackwell says, well, that and Katamari, we don't talk about her.

393
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:43,345
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

394
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:44,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we do.

395
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,686
[SPEAKER_10]: We love that series.

396
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:48,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't, we don't talk about the incident trademark.

397
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:51,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on Wikipedia somewhere and that's all you need.

398
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, back to the question.

399
00:28:54,513 --> 00:29:03,722
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, there's like a post from a year ago, like a year ago, on Reddit, that says, do I have to make a full English translation of Tsukuba no Shachou Rena?

400
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:08,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we were contacted about trying to find that episode.

401
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:10,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So somebody's doing something.

402
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll, we'll say, I hope they do it.

403
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:16,325
[SPEAKER_07]: They are, they are, by the way, working, making it to run on a dolphin.

404
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:17,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

405
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:17,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

406
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:24,573
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other story that got a lot of hits, you may have forgot the guitar, the guitar hero rocks the eighties or something like that.

407
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:27,976
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're on a Wikipedia article for that too, when that all happened.

408
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway.

409
00:29:30,287 --> 00:29:32,709
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have an actual Wikipedia article anymore, sadly.

410
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,670
[SPEAKER_10]: It got deleted because we're not notable enough.

411
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think now that we have a thousand fucking episodes we can get a Wikipedia article again?

412
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:44,939
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because they'll be like, well, yeah, but no one's listened to you, so it's fine.

413
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:45,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck them.

414
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:46,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's make one.

415
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody get on top of that.

416
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:55,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe somebody else will acknowledge this show that's not Wikipedia, but somebody we really love to acknowledge this show.

417
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:56,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Wink, wink, wink.

418
00:29:56,465 --> 00:30:01,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope in the near future I can say something about it because I would love to talk about it.

419
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Wink, wink, if you're out there.

420
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:03,546
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

421
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:06,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's go back to the question.

422
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:09,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Will you be voting for President Kat this election?

423
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:11,788
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, will you be voting for President Kat this election?

424
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want the real answer or the I wish I could answer?

425
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:19,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever you feel like giving on episode 1000.

426
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I could.

427
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:27,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a cat would do better than anyone we've had since Obama.

428
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:30,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, will you be voting for President Cat this election?

429
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,450
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I will not be voting for President Cat.

430
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:34,702
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura,

431
00:30:57,236 --> 00:31:03,200
[SPEAKER_10]: to ensure that he does not go back to office because that would just be... First, he could go to jail before all that happens.

432
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's fucking hope.

433
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:10,505
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, accountability is not a great theme in this country.

434
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:11,726
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's a whole other podcast.

435
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:16,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it wrong that I feel dirty saying his name?

436
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say it because it makes me feel dirty.

437
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,771
[SPEAKER_10]: No, let's talk about something that makes us feel awesome.

438
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the next question.

439
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:26,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And that question is, do you ever miss DDR?

440
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:33,261
[SPEAKER_10]: And why do you think the show doesn't talk as much about it?

441
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:38,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you ever miss DDR and why do you think the show doesn't talk as much about it?

442
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,928
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR is moved like past us.

443
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:50,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I hate to say, I mean, I could probably do DDR now that I'm doing ballet and my endurance is built back up.

444
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:51,157
[SPEAKER_07]: But

445
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how to answer that.

446
00:31:56,137 --> 00:32:03,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I could say I miss DDR, but I could also go visit DDR when I want to.

447
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:05,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to.

448
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:08,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

449
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:11,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sometimes I think about about playing.

450
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:11,575
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

451
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:19,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I think about wanting to go play and then I think about all the other stuff that I have to play.

452
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:25,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also doesn't have the same magic it used to when it was new and novel.

453
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:27,667
[SPEAKER_07]: When it was everything.

454
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:32,289
[SPEAKER_07]: When you were almost on the edge of this phenomenon.

455
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:33,810
[SPEAKER_07]: You were on the edge of this phenomenon.

456
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,092
[SPEAKER_07]: When we started playing, we really were.

457
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:39,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's just like...

458
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:43,263
[SPEAKER_07]: They've changed factors on the gameplay.

459
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:47,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I still, to this day, hate the hold steps.

460
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super polished and then...

461
00:32:54,013 --> 00:33:02,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm also really pissed off at how Konami has treated the American community.

462
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:10,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have to say I'm glad that the tourney circuit and all that is still going.

463
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:16,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's past its prime, but I think

464
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:18,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

465
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:45,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to get off my lazy butt and go clean off the dance pads that are at my garage.

466
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:54,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, I have a machine out there, just, you know, my lazy butt doesn't go out there to play because our garage is full of trash right now.

467
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:17,635
[SPEAKER_03]: After work, I'm exhausted mentally, and then to spend time exhausting myself physically, then I don't have that creative energy to work on Minecraft content, which I'm trying to use to escape the hellhole that is my day job.

468
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:23,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know, it's like, it's priorities and like, levels and stuff like that that try to do that.

469
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:27,400
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, I do think about it every time I go out to the garage to do laundry.

470
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I really need to play this thing.

471
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:36,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my, my StepMania computer that was in there already broke, but I still have the 573 in there.

472
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:39,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have Extreme, I could put on

473
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:41,949
[SPEAKER_03]: a few other games in there.

474
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:47,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I have like a multi-disc that can sort of work for some of them.

475
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:49,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I do still have fun playing it.

476
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:53,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to get back into it because unfortunately COVID made me fat.

477
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would like to not be fat anymore.

478
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:58,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

479
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:01,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR did that for me, that and walking three miles a day.

480
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:06,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I would love to get back to being able to do that again.

481
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it does get harder as I get older for sure.

482
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:14,356
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's only as far away as my garage.

483
00:35:14,356 --> 00:35:17,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So all right.

484
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:25,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also gonna throw this in there that I think it would be fun that when I if I make it on point that I try to play DDR on point.

485
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:30,769
[SPEAKER_10]: My take on the question, do I miss DDR?

486
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do.

487
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But why do you think the show doesn't talk as much about it?

488
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably because Step Maniacs is a better game.

489
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,448
[SPEAKER_10]: It is honestly like good night.

490
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:44,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like how it's five panel.

491
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:48,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I it's just it that's just it's too hard for me to play that.

492
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,573
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like all the songs in it.

493
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I like I really like all the songs.

494
00:35:52,234 --> 00:36:06,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It is essentially what I've always wanted a sequel to extreme to be which was, um, hey, let's take what we did back in extreme and that type of stuff and just keep doing that before forever before the hate mail starts coming in.

495
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:07,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just

496
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:10,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say an answer that would create drama.

497
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:11,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's the thing.

498
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

499
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:16,666
[SPEAKER_10]: In reality, of course, I miss the DDR community.

500
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:24,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss our Wednesday nights getting together and the, you know, having the food afterwards and, and all of that stuff.

501
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:27,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I, of course, I miss all of that.

502
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:28,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss that community.

503
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:33,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, leaning into why does the show not talk as much about it?

504
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,351
[SPEAKER_10]: It's blame Konami.

505
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:58,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami didn't risk DDR in this country for so long and didn't invest in the music games the way that other companies eventually did and found success with, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, and so on, that there was a gap in DDR for so long that caused us to find other stuff to play and kind of rediscover, like the community focus sort of shifted.

506
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I understand a lot of that is back now and round one has been instrumental in bringing a lot of that back to the forefront.

507
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:17,031
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think because our lives and our hobbies have changed, because Konami gave us too big of a break, I think other people have been able to find that space, you know, again, but for me, it's like,

508
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:19,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I'm out of shape.

509
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:20,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

510
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:30,744
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can't resist when I see a DDR machine in the wild, especially not so much round one, when I see a DDR machine, like lonely and neglected at a bowling alley.

511
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:36,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't help but sneak on there and just say, I'm gonna play a trick level song just for fun.

512
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's okay.

513
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:39,273
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, big guy.

514
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,234
[SPEAKER_07]: People still love you.

515
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:51,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also hard for like, for me to like, especially modern DVR, I once again, I'm from the the school of like, songs go up to 10.

516
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:52,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it and difficulty.

517
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:55,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do the math now with how they have songs.

518
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:55,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

519
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:58,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't convert to the like, I can't convert.

520
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:04,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it doesn't, like, I don't know what the difficulty of songs are anymore.

521
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's, that is a little bit of a challenge.

522
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:10,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, my brain still thinks I can do DDR.

523
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:11,224
[SPEAKER_03]: My body can't.

524
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:13,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's like, oh yeah, I could do that.

525
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I could, I can play that, those doubles.

526
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:16,687
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's fine.

527
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:20,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my body's like, no, no, you can't.

528
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:20,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

529
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:27,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I started ballet, I, I, there was no way I could do anything harder than maybe five or six.

530
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, bye bye 1.5.

531
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:32,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

532
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I will keep that as in mind.

533
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:45,051
[SPEAKER_03]: What also became difficult, Orange, right, with that is like, when I download songs, you know, off of the internet for my Step Media machine, it's like, was this used in the old format or the new format?

534
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:48,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this, is this ain't gonna be easy?

535
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this gonna be pretty hard?

536
00:38:51,718 --> 00:38:55,801
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, yeah, but also in all seriousness, super props to Step Maniacs.

537
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:59,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I see multiple people in chat kind of talking about, oh, all the cool things it does.

538
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:09,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I think really Step Maniacs kind of took the love of the game and really, you know, innovated on that concept for, you know, the modern day dance game fan.

539
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:10,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they've done a lot of great things.

540
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:11,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do.

541
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:12,134
[SPEAKER_10]: So congratulations.

542
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:16,277
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm very sorry for the things we said about In the Groove in the past.

543
00:39:16,277 --> 00:39:18,459
[SPEAKER_10]: It's water under the bridge, I hope at this point.

544
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:18,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

545
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the very least... Let me put it this way.

546
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it now.

547
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:23,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it now.

548
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:37,948
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very least, I would hope that if anything, if Konami was serious about their dance games, that they would at least take the opportunity to look at Step Maniacs and go, okay, we need to be better now than that to, you know, survive in this industry.

549
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:41,270
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Konami and, you know, they're not.

550
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I do wish our round window would get a Dance Rush stardom, because I do want to play that.

551
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks freaking awesome.

552
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:48,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's get to the next question.

553
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:56,917
[SPEAKER_10]: The next question is, what job would you want if you ever worked in the gaming industry?

554
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what job would you want if you ever worked in the gaming industry?

555
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:02,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked in the gaming industry, so like I've had lots of jobs.

556
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I've sold games and I've, you know, I've made games.

557
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:13,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess making games would still be fun.

558
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I would like to do that more.

559
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:22,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have the time for it, and certainly, you know, mental capacity for that sometimes.

560
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:26,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like to think, though, at least, you know, coding games and whatnot,

561
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:46,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helped me to be able to like break, you know, part certain things, especially like, for example, in Minecraft, you're doing redstone, you know, you kind of structure stuff like you would in games, you have, you take your your thing that you're trying to accomplish, break it out into components, and then figure out how to code each of those components.

562
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: and put them all together.

563
00:40:48,366 --> 00:40:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can also, you know, for example, take things that you've made before, take pieces of it and rearrange them and do all that.

564
00:40:55,053 --> 00:41:05,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that stuff is kind of with game design, like when you're, you know, creating games and you've had systems and stuff that you build for other things, you can repurpose those things and, you know, do that.

565
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:19,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would still like to, you know, for example, like, work on something for the Playdate that I bought, and that was my excuse for buying it, you know, certainly not to just have one.

566
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'd like to try that.

567
00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:28,157
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Game Boy, Game Boy Advanced system to, like, build stuff that

568
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:29,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Nest Maker

569
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:55,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me how to do this correctly so that it works the way I wanted it to?

570
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:59,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, some of the random movement stuff wasn't working right.

571
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:05,879
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to just be able to have a better understanding with that, because there's still, like, lots of stuff being made with Nest Maker.

572
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:11,803
[SPEAKER_03]: They just put out their official strategy guide, which my game is also inside of, which I thought was pretty cool.

573
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:13,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot I even bought that.

574
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:13,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.

575
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:16,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so there's that.

576
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

577
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:26,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, yeah, lots of opportunity, even like going to Unity or Godot or something like that, um, would be, I would, I mean, yeah, it would be a lot of fun to do that.

578
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:34,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, developing a game takes a lot of time and that's time that I don't have amongst the other things that I want to do.

579
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, probably not going to happen right now.

580
00:42:39,572 --> 00:42:44,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, for me, well, my my Siri, actually, it is a serious answer.

581
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:45,676
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a joke answer.

582
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:47,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I would want to host a revival of Starcade.

583
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:48,577
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the job.

584
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:51,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be a fucking game show host.

585
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:54,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to host a game show about video games, a revival of Nick arcade.

586
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:55,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take that too.

587
00:42:55,621 --> 00:43:06,848
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my absolute dream job to be honest, on a somewhat like, you know, serious, what is achievable note, I would still you know, in my day job, my day world, I work with a

588
00:43:08,028 --> 00:43:09,709
[SPEAKER_10]: learning in a corporate environment.

589
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:13,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So like training and development, corporate learning type of stuff is what I do.

590
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:19,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't talk a lot about my day job for and for good reason, because there's a very clear line between those things.

591
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:22,895
[SPEAKER_10]: But and I've told this story on the show before, so it's not a huge surprise.

592
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:26,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say it was right when Alan first moved here.

593
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:32,122
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

594
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:57,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Like with Alan just having moved here, I think making that move, I don't think would have been the right call at that time.

595
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Assuming I even got it, which you know, I hadn't been offered the job.

596
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:04,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I pulled myself from contention after the first, I think there might have been two interviews.

597
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:30,988
[SPEAKER_10]: and Bobby Blackwell says you also probably wouldn't still be there now and that is also a very stability is really fucking nice but I think my serious answer is I would I would have to I think do what is my other passion during my nine to five which is adult learning and that that whole environment I think I would want to take that into the gaming industry but that is a very very specialized thing but important

598
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:40,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be my dream to do music design, you know, back in the day.

599
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:52,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, this is now going to be a serious answer with my current skill set, with my background in design, but also my more recent experience in project management.

600
00:44:53,012 --> 00:45:02,917
[SPEAKER_07]: is it I really do think I would love to do some sort of project management for like coordinated efforts like maybe for hashing out, you know,

601
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:10,976
[SPEAKER_07]: a new game, I guess, you know, be the coordinator between, you know, with deliverables.

602
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:17,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And although I still would love to to be a writer, you know, I haven't given up on that either.

603
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:22,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm writing a book right now that I've been writing the same book for the last three years.

604
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:25,559
[SPEAKER_07]: But I digress.

605
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming up with ideas and integrating them

606
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:39,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, like, doing project management with a side of, like, writing continuity, does that make sense?

607
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:40,389
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it does.

608
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:52,428
[SPEAKER_07]: like bringing the parts together, making things work, making sure that the deliverables, I don't want to be responsible for people, but I would love to be the one that helps bring the project together.

609
00:45:52,428 --> 00:45:55,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that sounds super fun to me.

610
00:45:55,409 --> 00:46:05,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I've also looked into like community management positions to like, um, the, uh, Pokemon company was hiring for a hot minute.

611
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:06,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really tempted.

612
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It's right now.

613
00:46:07,795 --> 00:46:10,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's the right time given the present environment.

614
00:46:12,017 --> 00:46:26,068
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, there's also aspects of gaming within the place that I work at that I can't bring up on the podcast that I would love to be involved with, but that's probably not going to happen.

615
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:29,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we got two questions left.

616
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:33,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That's assuming y'all in chat don't throw something else at us here in the next few minutes.

617
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,371
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do want to get we actually do have gaming news to talk about tonight and so forth.

618
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:37,752
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll get to that.

619
00:46:37,752 --> 00:46:39,512
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have two questions left.

620
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:42,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's here's the next last question.

621
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:43,415
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the plan for Episode 2000?

622
00:46:43,415 --> 00:46:47,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully still be alive Jesus.

623
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:51,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so let's do the math.

624
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:54,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Another another Liza Minnelli reference tonight.

625
00:46:54,303 --> 00:47:01,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, being alive would be the plan.

626
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:05,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just doing the math on this.

627
00:47:05,428 --> 00:47:12,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be I don't even want to think about being that old.

628
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:17,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be 67 if it's if it takes another 22 years to get there, which assuming I'd be 67 I'd be 70.

629
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:24,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that I want to actually be 70.

630
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:36,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe by then, you know, I'll have all my bionic limbs and, you know, and I agree with DarkTetsuya, 2046 if we survive the Snatcher invasion.

631
00:47:36,932 --> 00:47:38,732
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I don't I don't know.

632
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:46,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably going to be, you know, at least 50 percent bionic parts and can actually play DDR then.

633
00:47:46,794 --> 00:47:48,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

634
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I. I don't.

635
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:58,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that that's going to logically be possible.

636
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:07,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we'll be the oldest gaming podcast for long retired people.

637
00:48:07,038 --> 00:48:14,465
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be in our nursing home going, I'm playing my DDRs right now with my controller.

638
00:48:14,465 --> 00:48:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: What was I playing?

639
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:26,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead by Daylight, Minecraft, HowFastIs14, again.

640
00:48:26,374 --> 00:48:27,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

641
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:34,938
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just be like, I can't, I can't, I can barely picture my own birthday next week.

642
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, I'm just like, thank you.

643
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I have goals.

644
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a subathon you want to plug?

645
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:50,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, on Friday, April 19th, starting at 11 o'clock a.m.

646
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:53,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific Time until maybe past 11 p.m.

647
00:48:53,415 --> 00:48:54,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific Time.

648
00:48:54,797 --> 00:48:57,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I am doing a subathon.

649
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:59,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Subbing isn't necessary.

650
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:01,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I really just want people to hang out with me.

651
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to give me a present, a sub works.

652
00:49:04,626 --> 00:49:08,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that I play Dead by Daylight again, I'm gonna really try to come and play some games.

653
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:16,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm gonna have open lobbies, and I may do, like, an avatar palette cleanser.

654
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:24,661
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, I'm even planning on being on cam, so I have redeems that mean I have to do pliés and élivés.

655
00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:34,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran into a lady at Daiso who was just a little bit older than me.

656
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:39,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were talking about like how it was us that went out and played video games and everything.

657
00:49:39,596 --> 00:49:42,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, Oh, now I'm into gardening.

658
00:49:42,078 --> 00:49:42,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like,

659
00:49:47,376 --> 00:50:01,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I paid, had it not been for certain things, what would have been $3,000 for a computer just to play my video games online and show people and talk to them and scream at the game.

660
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:06,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

661
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't feel like any mentally older.

662
00:50:11,702 --> 00:50:16,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I give less of a shit about some things.

663
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:25,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm thinking back to doing OLR.

664
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:31,426
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR was what got me streaming in the first place, and then I had that period where I was bullied a bit.

665
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:34,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I came back, and it's through

666
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:42,633
[SPEAKER_07]: the show actually introducing me to what Dead by Daylight actually is to play and me deciding I'm going to start from noob.

667
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:43,033
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

668
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:43,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

669
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:44,514
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

670
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:44,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you.

671
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:46,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start from absolute noob and stream my progress in this damn game.

672
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:47,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was a Legion main.

673
00:50:47,154 --> 00:51:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie

674
00:51:06,115 --> 00:51:07,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

675
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:11,638
[SPEAKER_10]: For those that don't understand, I'm the one that said, Jamie, you should try this game.

676
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:13,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you'd enjoy it.

677
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at trailers before and I was like, I don't know.

678
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,562
[SPEAKER_07]: This will make me, this will make me, I'll be mad.

679
00:51:20,562 --> 00:51:21,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like first person.

680
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be a survivor because I don't want to die.

681
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:30,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm like, I played killer for three years and then added survivor.

682
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:31,367
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

683
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:32,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I got one more answer for this.

684
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I've got stuff.

685
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:37,480
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the plan for episode 2000?

686
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,524
[SPEAKER_10]: It will probably be completely generated by AI, the way things are going.

687
00:51:42,524 --> 00:51:55,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I authorize that, but I feel like at that point, if I can even speak at that point, it will probably be something that is completely AI generated at that point.

688
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey ChatGBT, generate what an episode 2000 of OLR might look like.

689
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:04,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that TLC had a completely AI-generated romance flick?

690
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, no.

691
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:07,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is as bad as it is.

692
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, it's so bad.

693
00:52:09,899 --> 00:52:17,366
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a trailer, and they put stuff in the trailer, and they're like, yeah, that's good, and it's not, it's not.

694
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:19,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes the room look like a cinematic masterpiece.

695
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:20,008
[SPEAKER_03]: TCL.

696
00:52:20,008 --> 00:52:20,889
[SPEAKER_03]: TCL.

697
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Clocks don't have two threes on them.

698
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:23,492
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean it's not Rob?

699
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:27,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in a way, it is a little bit.

700
00:52:27,498 --> 00:52:31,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there is one final question.

701
00:52:31,202 --> 00:52:32,423
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a whopper.

702
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,384
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a deep question.

703
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:33,824
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

704
00:52:33,824 --> 00:52:34,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

705
00:52:34,825 --> 00:52:36,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Last question.

706
00:52:36,507 --> 00:52:41,752
[SPEAKER_10]: When written about in the history books, what do you want people to remember about OLR?

707
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:50,365
[SPEAKER_10]: A callback from an episode three weeks ago or so.

708
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:53,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I want them to remember that we were woke and gay.

709
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:54,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night!

710
00:52:54,928 --> 00:53:01,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Woke and gay.

711
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:05,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I want... And that we never sold out!

712
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:08,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

713
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:09,618
[SPEAKER_07]: No, woke and gay is cool.

714
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:10,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with woke and gay.

715
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

716
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:23,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just be happy that they remembered us at all.

717
00:53:23,428 --> 00:53:24,529
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of sad.

718
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:27,932
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll remember us.

719
00:53:27,932 --> 00:53:31,315
[SPEAKER_05]: All 40 people watching right now.

720
00:53:31,315 --> 00:53:34,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to be remembered as a show that really

721
00:53:36,516 --> 00:53:40,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we were the first show period to take phone calls live on Skype.

722
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I really believe that.

723
00:53:53,636 --> 00:53:54,896
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't have the proof.

724
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:57,297
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a hard thing to claim.

725
00:53:57,297 --> 00:53:59,858
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love that we did that for as long as we did.

726
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:01,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that was a lot.

727
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,641
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bummer Microsoft like literally has killed Skype in favor of teams at this point.

728
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:07,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we've had to shift as well.

729
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:10,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think we generate as many calls this way.

730
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:11,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that.

731
00:54:11,503 --> 00:54:13,964
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think taking calls over Skype was really cool.

732
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:18,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And having the live chat was also great.

733
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:20,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that we have been able to

734
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:23,950
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, obviously the three of us do an awful lot for the show.

735
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:28,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, our personality is all over the show.

736
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:34,882
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's really all of you that, that oftentimes make this car go in a completely different direction.

737
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:36,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would want to re remember- You're all a part of this.

738
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:45,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would want to be remembered that we were really one of the first shows to really go the extra mile to incorporate the audience as well.

739
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:48,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, PodCulture says y'all birthed other shows too.

740
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's probably the ultimate compliment, to be quite honest.

741
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,651
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the probably the best possible compliment somebody can say is,

742
00:54:56,631 --> 00:55:01,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I started podcasting because your guys' show was so terrible, I knew I could do better.

743
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:04,636
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but you know what I mean?

744
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:08,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, you know, I wanted to do what you all were doing.

745
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:13,381
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's, yeah, very humbling and really great.

746
00:55:13,381 --> 00:55:20,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think going back, throwback to the last question, I think this show lives on through the other shows that it birthed.

747
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:33,321
[SPEAKER_10]: much like we are carrying out in a weird way under station live and everything we learned from that you know so yeah anyway uh that's it everybody answered that i think

748
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:38,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you all for indulging us there a little bit.

749
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:45,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says people can remember the OLR prove that just because you're old doesn't mean you can't like the new stuff, too.

750
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:45,687
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

751
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:46,348
[SPEAKER_10]: We are hip.

752
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:47,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, fellow kids.

753
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:49,769
[SPEAKER_10]: That is right.

754
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:52,550
[SPEAKER_10]: YYR says, didn't all those other shows end already?

755
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,430
[SPEAKER_10]: LOL.

756
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

757
00:55:55,031 --> 00:55:55,771
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends.

758
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:58,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're talking about like Horde House and things like that, yes.

759
00:55:58,092 --> 00:55:59,493
[SPEAKER_10]: But like, I think

760
00:56:00,509 --> 00:56:04,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma has credited for Anime Jam Session, which is still going.

761
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,292
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think there's other shows too that maybe haven't said it as explicitly.

762
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:10,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so it's, yeah.

763
00:56:10,253 --> 00:56:18,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's still other things in the works, you know, I've got a couple of projects that are floating around until I get other projects done.

764
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

765
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:22,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear a scary fact.

766
00:56:22,398 --> 00:56:25,059
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go for another 20 years, you never know.

767
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be people that aren't born yet that start podcasts that are based off of our show.

768
00:56:31,894 --> 00:56:33,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that scary?

769
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:43,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I think that we actually do have listeners who were born during the time frame that our show has existed.

770
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:46,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate thinking about that.

771
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:47,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me too.

772
00:56:47,564 --> 00:56:50,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

773
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:51,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there we go.

774
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:52,587
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

775
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:57,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Cosmos Eve in chat says your show is literally older than me.

776
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:57,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

777
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you everybody, we're off to die.

778
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:01,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

779
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:29,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, okay, I'm going to step back for something real too, though, is that doing this show and keep up doing this show has been what's given me some of the confidence to go out and do other big things in my life, like going back to streaming, doing fucking ballet in my 40s, you know?

780
00:57:29,347 --> 00:57:33,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a goal that when I'm 50, I want to be on point.

781
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:33,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And

782
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:40,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have never had a goal like that if I hadn't had the big confidence booster that doing this show has.

783
00:57:40,242 --> 00:57:53,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And the show has actually helped me get over a lot of personal hang-ups and reiterate that what other people think of you is not my business.

784
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they try to make it my business, fuck them.

785
00:57:57,092 --> 00:57:58,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm meaning like the negative stuff.

786
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:00,073
[SPEAKER_07]: You can keep giving me compliments.

787
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:00,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I thrive on that shit.

788
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:11,203
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as we joke about that nobody listens to this show, I do think there have been several opportunities that have been created because of this show.

789
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:14,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we got to go to E3 and it's prime because of this show.

790
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:20,288
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to, you know, hang out there and be on the breaking news front lines of that and live that life.

791
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was an opportunity because of this show.

792
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:24,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to play Supernova.

793
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,011
[SPEAKER_07]: We met Yamaoka.

794
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:26,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

795
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:27,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Naoki.

796
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:28,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We met.

797
00:58:28,152 --> 00:58:30,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally have run into twice Kojima.

798
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:35,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to meet Kondo-san, Koji Kondo.

799
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:53,032
[SPEAKER_10]: being in video games now, being a part of the art that we, you know, even like with a brief cameo, being a part of the art that we so love and talk about every week.

800
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm talking about specifically two instances come to mind.

801
00:58:55,914 --> 00:58:58,135
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been more, but these two will always come to mind.

802
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:03,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first one is Bungie ferret tossing, which our very own YYR did on Xbox 360.

803
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:10,966
[SPEAKER_10]: which unfortunately is no longer available because they sunset the XNA or whatever it was, that indie game thing.

804
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:14,430
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know how fucking cool that was to fire it up on my Xbox 360?

805
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:19,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we did have the gamer pics, which was also cool, and the OLR logo was up there.

806
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:23,579
[SPEAKER_10]: right off the bat.

807
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:25,300
[SPEAKER_10]: The Typing of the Dead was more of a mod.

808
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,501
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like Sega themselves put us in the game, you know?

809
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:28,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's fun stuff.

810
00:59:28,582 --> 00:59:29,642
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it is fun.

811
00:59:29,642 --> 00:59:32,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say, and YYR says, Bungie ferret tossing will be back.

812
00:59:32,844 --> 00:59:34,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally guarantee this.

813
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:34,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

814
00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:37,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've always been lovely with making the OLR dream games a reality.

815
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:42,449
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would say from one end of the pendulum to the other, so you got the indie game, right?

816
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:43,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say

817
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:48,011
[SPEAKER_10]: when we showed up in that Namco collection on PlayStation 3.

818
00:59:48,011 --> 00:59:51,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a very, there's a very subtle blink and you miss it.

819
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:57,343
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you fire up the Namco collection on PlayStation 3, thank you, Namco Museum Essentials, that was the name of the game.

820
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,866
[SPEAKER_10]: If you fire it up on PlayStation 3, there's a splash screen

821
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:02,027
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

822
01:00:22,094 --> 01:00:26,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, TutorialSkree actually had our host names in there.

823
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was, yeah, me, I don't remember.

824
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:31,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Tinkle, maybe, I don't know, something, it was something.

825
01:00:31,983 --> 01:00:39,510
[SPEAKER_10]: But obviously, that was somebody on the inside, showing that they were listening to this show.

826
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was, that was an incredible feeling, especially because the fact, especially for what it was,

827
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:48,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, why I cite this one because there's been other little random cameo appearances too.

828
01:00:48,176 --> 01:01:03,042
[SPEAKER_10]: But the reason why I cite this one specifically is because the fact that this was like alongside literal Namco classics that I grew up on, that we are able to share that space with fucking Pac-Man.

829
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:05,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't even know, Dragon Spirit was in that collection.

830
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:05,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it was a big one.

831
01:01:05,943 --> 01:01:12,826
[SPEAKER_10]: These really like, Dig Dug, I think it was another big one in that one, that we were sharing the space with that just felt like

832
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

833
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:17,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, did it kids.

834
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:17,987
[SPEAKER_10]: We did it.

835
01:01:17,987 --> 01:01:19,088
[SPEAKER_10]: That was that was it.

836
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:19,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Loki, I'm sorry.

837
01:01:19,828 --> 01:01:20,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I went for like five minutes.

838
01:01:20,768 --> 01:01:23,209
[SPEAKER_10]: You were trying to say something earlier if you even remember.

839
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:24,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember now.

840
01:01:24,149 --> 01:01:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

841
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,090
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

842
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:26,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

843
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:27,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember now.

844
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, just yeah, doing the podcast this long.

845
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made me very comfortable in other podcasts.

846
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:36,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I could just like anything.

847
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,713
[SPEAKER_03]: No stress whatsoever.

848
01:01:37,713 --> 01:01:41,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for as long as I can remember.

849
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:42,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

850
01:01:42,755 --> 01:01:42,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

851
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,361
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure, for sure.

852
01:01:45,361 --> 01:01:46,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, okay.

853
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:50,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for indulging us on our kickoff topic tonight, which was all about us.

854
01:01:50,664 --> 01:01:51,985
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get into other stuff.

855
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:58,029
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, as we always do, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

856
01:01:58,029 --> 01:02:00,131
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, I will start with you as usual.

857
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:00,711
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your game week?

858
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:05,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I played my usuals pretty much.

859
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:13,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I played more Dracula XX, Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known as Symphony of the Night.

860
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Dead by Daylight.

861
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:16,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I take that back.

862
01:02:16,765 --> 01:02:17,105
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I did...

863
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:26,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Dead by Daylight, I think, after the show last week, but I didn't play on Tuesday because I've been getting a breast sinus infection and I had a really bad headache.

864
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I just couldn't play.

865
01:02:28,272 --> 01:02:35,477
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've played more Avatar, which I've beaten, but I'm going back and trying to get all the side quests done.

866
01:02:35,477 --> 01:02:36,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

867
01:02:36,518 --> 01:02:41,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the just the freedom and doing like

868
01:02:41,981 --> 01:02:53,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Little tiny things in that game, and I'm really hoping that there's more DLC that comes out that deals with some of the sort of suspended storylines, I reckon, with some characters who just walked off.

869
01:02:53,993 --> 01:02:57,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are they now?

870
01:02:57,517 --> 01:03:00,460
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's been the big thing, you know.

871
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:03,330
[SPEAKER_07]: My usual.

872
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:06,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been it's been a very busy week as well because I'm in training at work.

873
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:15,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So being in training and being sick means I just play what I can vegetate to.

874
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:16,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

875
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:33,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this week I played the game that's behind me, which is Turbo Kid, and it's an excellent Metroidvania game, highly worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of the movie like I am, and I've made people watch it, and I will continue to make people watch the movie.

876
01:03:33,149 --> 01:03:34,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It is great, you should check it out.

877
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:38,753
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the game itself is also very good.

878
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:46,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the whole gameplay, the animation to it, the story, they have all the music that's, I think, from the movie too.

879
01:03:46,935 --> 01:03:48,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really good.

880
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:53,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that it continues the story from the movie, which is a lot of fun.

881
01:03:53,736 --> 01:03:55,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can check that out.

882
01:03:55,257 --> 01:03:58,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have what they call a non-canon playthrough.

883
01:03:58,157 --> 01:04:01,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play as Apple as well, which I thought was interesting.

884
01:04:01,298 --> 01:04:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it'd be non-canon because she's dead.

885
01:04:04,419 --> 01:04:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler.

886
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:06,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Fallout 4

887
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead I modded Fallout 4 for like 8 hours yesterday and still haven't played it yet.

888
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,351
[SPEAKER_03]: But I intend to play Fallout 4 at some point.

889
01:04:20,351 --> 01:04:27,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I wanted to play Fallout 4 is because I binge watched the entire Fallout TV series, which is excellent in my opinion.

890
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:31,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not a huge Fallout nut as far as the lore goes.

891
01:04:31,738 --> 01:04:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, I guess, a casual enjoyer of Fallout.

892
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't bent out of shape about New Vegas stuff and, you know, canon and this and that.

893
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:43,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for what it is.

894
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:51,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the show is really enjoyable, and I liked the characters in it, and I'm very excited for the next season, so hopefully that'll be coming very soon.

895
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:57,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine that this is highly successful because all the reviews have been great on it.

896
01:04:57,037 --> 01:04:59,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, looking forward to that.

897
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:04,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Minecraft's been playing, you know, a lot of that.

898
01:05:04,203 --> 01:05:09,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working, trying to work mostly on my theme park ride, and so,

899
01:05:10,814 --> 01:05:14,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Struggling to get everything done with that.

900
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:39,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I Put together the redstone for the scoring system in it, which was complicated so that's at least all set up now and I've been trying to go through and actually do the Detail decorating on everything and because I had before that I what I'm calling wool boxing and that's essentially just great boxes dividing up the show building if you will

901
01:05:40,433 --> 01:05:42,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

902
01:05:56,824 --> 01:06:26,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it now where 14 boats can be going at the same time and the game is actually going to keep track of 14 different scores at the same time using redstone magic and scoreboards in the game and so it was complicated to get that all working but now it does in theory and so yeah it's just trying to work through that it's just taking a very long time and I really need to get past this like

903
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:30,825
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everything needs to be done before I can put it in an episode.

904
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Because next season, when I work on the next project, which is going to be even bigger than this, it cannot be in one episode because of the nature of how it's going to go.

905
01:06:39,347 --> 01:06:47,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to look to kind of how Tango did his decked-outs 2 from last season of Hermitcraft.

906
01:06:49,059 --> 01:07:00,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just trying to trying to get that so that, you know, people start looking at my channel a little bit more because the growth is super slow and it's getting frustrating.

907
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:02,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But.

908
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:04,295
[SPEAKER_03]: How it always is.

909
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:06,697
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got to keep at it, keep at it because you love it.

910
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:09,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, let's see my game a week.

911
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:12,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I was pretty busy in my day life.

912
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't have as much time for games.

913
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:17,538
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did still play plenty of Final Fantasy 14.

914
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:18,740
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my go to.

915
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to get all my jobs to 90 before Dawn Trail comes out.

916
01:07:22,063 --> 01:07:23,304
[SPEAKER_10]: The benchmark came out today.

917
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:24,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Sable, I love her.

918
01:07:44,804 --> 01:07:47,286
[SPEAKER_10]: also known as Michaela's girlfriend.

919
01:07:47,286 --> 01:08:00,055
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I've been I've been having fun playing as Cheryl even though I think I've maybe won one of the like 10 games I've played because I don't know if my skill regressed or what or I'm just using a very bad build.

920
01:08:00,055 --> 01:08:08,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I just playing with pugs all the time is very soul draining because people just don't come to get you off hook.

921
01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:10,062
[SPEAKER_10]: They just don't care.

922
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:12,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very boring.

923
01:08:12,163 --> 01:08:13,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, um,

924
01:08:13,864 --> 01:08:26,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, I still have been playing, to be fair, I do play the GPS games, you know, the Ingress, the Pokemon Go, quite a bit, quite a bit of Monster Hunter now, actually, still been doing that, trying to level up my gear and all that good stuff.

925
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:30,099
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

926
01:08:30,099 --> 01:08:34,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of new stuff, but hopefully that'll change in the coming weeks.

927
01:08:34,362 --> 01:08:34,603
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

928
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:38,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to do news on our 1000th episode?

929
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:38,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we are.

930
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:39,808
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get right back into it.

931
01:08:39,808 --> 01:08:40,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

932
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:43,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Why wouldn't we do the thing we always do here at Orange Launch Radio?

933
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:44,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

934
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Get into some news.

935
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:52,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So also, I got the screenshot and I'm linking it like in the chat room of us in the Namco Museum.

936
01:08:52,953 --> 01:08:55,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, somebody sent you this screenshot or?

937
01:08:55,315 --> 01:08:58,717
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I found a YouTube video and screenshotted it.

938
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's a YouTube.

939
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:01,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's all.

940
01:09:01,078 --> 01:09:02,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't have even thought of that.

941
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:05,381
[SPEAKER_10]: A long play out there or something that shows that, huh?

942
01:09:05,381 --> 01:09:07,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how funny.

943
01:09:07,802 --> 01:09:10,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, I'm looking through my Blue Sky account.

944
01:09:10,004 --> 01:09:12,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I can I can't even do that better.

945
01:09:12,746 --> 01:09:15,808
[SPEAKER_10]: What I can do is just go thanks to the magic of Internet.

946
01:09:15,808 --> 01:09:16,688
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

947
01:09:16,688 --> 01:09:18,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's the screenshot.

948
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:18,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

949
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,110
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see.

950
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:26,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky DarkSakura, Loki, Tinker is what they but I'm almost positive that's supposed to be like a washed version of tingle.

951
01:09:26,973 --> 01:09:29,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I Dragon Spirit I noticed over here.

952
01:09:29,734 --> 01:09:30,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.

953
01:09:30,654 --> 01:09:31,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, LR.

954
01:09:31,694 --> 01:09:33,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, LR.

955
01:09:33,695 --> 01:09:36,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, cool.

956
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:37,276
[SPEAKER_10]: That's funny.

957
01:09:37,276 --> 01:09:39,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how did that get in there?

958
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:40,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

959
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:41,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

960
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:46,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's move on and talk about our news.

961
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get into

962
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:50,637
[SPEAKER_10]: This First Story, Loki.

963
01:09:51,772 --> 01:10:07,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we talked about a while ago that, you know, Blizzard wasn't going to be able to publish their games in China anymore because of a disagreement with, I think it was actually NetEase at the time, but now they're back.

964
01:10:07,084 --> 01:10:08,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They're back together.

965
01:10:08,545 --> 01:10:18,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So Blizzard Entertainment put out a tweet that announced that we are pleased to announce that a new agreement with NetEase to bring Blizzard games back to mainland China has been made.

966
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:21,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And so thank you for your patience and support.

967
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:28,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty awesome that they'll get to play their World of Warcraft stuff.

968
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:37,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I think a lot of that ends up being modified, like, you know, there's, uh, it's not really undead because of the things they can and can't show.

969
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:44,557
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, yeah, no, I, I know the folks over there are probably thrilled to have the games coming back.

970
01:10:44,557 --> 01:10:48,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and I also wonder how much resentment there might be for them leaving in the first place.

971
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:49,958
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, people that are just like, fuck it.

972
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:50,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going back.

973
01:10:50,678 --> 01:10:53,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause you know, fuck them forever leaving in the first place.

974
01:10:53,179 --> 01:10:55,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine there's probably going to be a little bit of that as well.

975
01:10:55,099 --> 01:10:57,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

976
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:57,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

977
01:10:57,459 --> 01:10:57,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

978
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

979
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it,

980
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's all like money.

981
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:05,685
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why there was a, probably a disagreement in the first place.

982
01:11:05,685 --> 01:11:13,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that, you know, Blizzard's owned by Microsoft, I'm sure that they had some different amounts of money to throw around.

983
01:11:15,379 --> 01:11:16,420
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

984
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:27,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this week was the closure of the Wii Online services for, excuse me, Nintendo Online services for the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS.

985
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:37,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And just as soon as those servers went down, the very next day, folks are finding ways to be able to play online multiplayer games again, like Splatoon and so forth.

986
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,782
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a service called Pretendo.

987
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:45,745
[SPEAKER_10]: a fan collective that they what they used to do was custom Wii U servers.

988
01:11:45,745 --> 01:11:52,009
[SPEAKER_10]: But now Pretendo is opening their servers to everybody and all you have to do is do a DNS change.

989
01:11:52,009 --> 01:11:54,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this was very smart what they did.

990
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:58,593
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't say anything about how they were going to do this until Nintendo pulled the plug.

991
01:11:58,593 --> 01:12:04,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And essentially, because I would assume they also can't really do firmware updates at this point now because they pulled all that well,

992
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:07,338
[SPEAKER_10]: The Pokemon stuff is still running.

993
01:12:07,338 --> 01:12:08,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a shell of something there.

994
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:15,543
[SPEAKER_10]: So I maybe if Nintendo really wanted to close this loophole, they could, but they're fucking dicks if they do like let's let's be real.

995
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:18,585
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a DNS change that you make.

996
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:21,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And that means you do not have to use homebrew.

997
01:12:21,527 --> 01:12:23,348
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not have to use custom firmware.

998
01:12:23,348 --> 01:12:24,069
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an exploit.

999
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:25,930
[SPEAKER_10]: They're even calling it an exploit.

1000
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:26,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And

1001
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:39,686
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah we and they even say in a tweet we've been holding on to this exploit for this day for quite some time in case nintendo decided to issue patches for it so it's not even a case they will not even a secret

1002
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,421
[SPEAKER_03]: No fun.

1003
01:12:41,421 --> 01:12:45,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Some services that use their own SSL libraries are not supported.

1004
01:12:45,603 --> 01:12:50,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would mean like Watch Dogs, YouTube, because those are third party titles.

1005
01:12:50,747 --> 01:12:54,329
[SPEAKER_10]: TV, I totally forgot about TV.

1006
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:56,971
[SPEAKER_10]: The eShop, Miiverse, those things will work.

1007
01:12:56,971 --> 01:13:02,495
[SPEAKER_10]: But Miiverse functionality in games will work through SSSL.

1008
01:13:02,495 --> 01:13:05,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So the details on how to do this if you want to play Splatoon,

1009
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:11,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart 8 or whatever, head over to Pretendo.network.

1010
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:13,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And they haven't been cease and desisted yet.

1011
01:13:13,624 --> 01:13:14,605
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

1012
01:13:14,605 --> 01:13:17,949
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, again, like Nintendo literally pulled the plug.

1013
01:13:17,949 --> 01:13:20,491
[SPEAKER_10]: And I see a lot of this as game preservation.

1014
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:28,619
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if there is no, I mean, Mario Kart 8 is one thing, but there is no way now to play the original Splatoon

1015
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,785
[SPEAKER_10]: online with you know, which it really is.

1016
01:13:31,785 --> 01:13:35,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, there's single player mode, but the online mode is a special unique thing.

1017
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:38,740
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no way to do it unless you use something like this.

1018
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:38,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1019
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:45,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, and Mike Def says this is this is how most people should do it.

1020
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait for a full version and shadow drop it.

1021
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwell saying Pretendo had this in their back pocket for months and just waited to announce it.

1022
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:54,381
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the smart thing to do.

1023
01:13:54,381 --> 01:13:56,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's especially when dealing with Nintendo.

1024
01:13:56,762 --> 01:13:58,122
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you have to do it.

1025
01:13:58,122 --> 01:14:01,603
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to just drop it and leave.

1026
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once it's on the internet, it's on the internet forever.

1027
01:14:04,303 --> 01:14:08,804
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, let's move on DarkSakura.

1028
01:14:10,516 --> 01:14:21,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm really not at all surprised by this, but Baldur's Gate 3 became the first game to win every major Game of the Year award.

1029
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:25,924
[SPEAKER_07]: every one of them.

1030
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:41,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It took the BAFTA, it got the Golden Joystick, the Game Award Primary, the DICE Awards, the Game Developer Choice Awards,

1031
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:59,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it was up against, I mean, with a lot of these, especially in the BAFTAs, it was up against Alan Wake 2, Tears of the Kingdom, Spider-Man 2, and like, this is pretty crazy, and it's beaten out, it did better than Elden Ring did, and we know

1032
01:14:59,974 --> 01:15:01,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Elden Ring Vampire Survivor

1033
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:21,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf says it did not win the Bobby Blackwolf Game of the Year Awards.

1034
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,018
[SPEAKER_10]: This headline is misleading.

1035
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:23,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Bobby.

1036
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:39,436
[SPEAKER_10]: It is major video game award awards, which I think there's five that at least Wikipedia, who I don't consider the source for everything, but I think Wikipedia will list as the like major gaming award productions that happen.

1037
01:15:39,436 --> 01:15:39,516
[SPEAKER_10]: So

1038
01:15:40,635 --> 01:15:48,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, um, yeah, with Elegant, yeah, it was, uh, the Baftas actually did pick, uh, Vampire Savior, Survivors, sorry.

1039
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:48,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1040
01:15:48,981 --> 01:15:52,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Vampire Savior is Darkstalkers!

1041
01:15:52,443 --> 01:16:01,529
[SPEAKER_07]: But, hey, it's, it's great, um, I haven't tried playing it since I got my, my new computer, but, um,

1042
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:04,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great one.

1043
01:16:04,737 --> 01:16:07,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a great voice acting and in hot stuff.

1044
01:16:07,919 --> 01:16:14,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those games I still need to go back and visit properly because I don't think I got it gave it a fair shot the first time through but I need to try it again.

1045
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:20,569
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just let's throw that in the ever growing backlog of games I'll never get around to because I play MMOs.

1046
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:22,130
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, moving on Loki.

1047
01:16:25,222 --> 01:16:27,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so this is kind of funny.

1048
01:16:27,924 --> 01:16:34,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's apparently a game studio, Possibility Space, which was created by Jeff Strain.

1049
01:16:34,769 --> 01:16:37,350
[SPEAKER_03]: He also created State of Decay.

1050
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:39,712
[SPEAKER_03]: He is closing down his studio because of leaks.

1051
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:59,781
[SPEAKER_03]: This had, I guess, been prompted from some questions that they received from Ethan Gatch of Kotaku, asking them about a game that they're working on.

1052
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:06,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently this game was supposed to be under, of course, NDA, and as a result,

1053
01:17:12,848 --> 01:17:23,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week I received a list of topics and questions from Ethan Gatch, a reporter of Kotaku, regarding an article he's writing about Pytania Media and the closure of Crop Circle Games.

1054
01:17:23,158 --> 01:17:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Much of it was expected, but I was also stunned to see non-public information about Project Vognut.

1055
01:17:31,645 --> 01:17:40,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Disclosure of our publishing partner with details of our business and financial relationship and details of internal P&L discussions and confidential all-company meetings.

1056
01:17:58,393 --> 01:18:08,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaks of this nature are typically malicious and done by outside hacking, so to see internal team members under confidentiality agreements engage in this was shocking.

1057
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:16,107
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of this cancellation of our publishing relationship and careful consideration, I am closing Possibility Space.

1058
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:19,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Today is your last day of employment at this company.

1059
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,511
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on and so forth.

1060
01:18:21,511 --> 01:18:23,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk about taking your ball and going home.

1061
01:18:23,352 --> 01:18:24,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Geez.

1062
01:18:24,293 --> 01:18:31,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, yeah, I've retained a lawyer who will oversee the wind down for the studio and blah blah blah.

1063
01:18:31,658 --> 01:18:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1064
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear that everyone?

1065
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:35,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I've retained a lawyer.

1066
01:18:35,641 --> 01:18:38,103
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be a legal issue.

1067
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: This I think is it's talking about like the wind down of the company.

1068
01:18:41,785 --> 01:18:45,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's for like HR and stuff like that.

1069
01:18:45,088 --> 01:18:45,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1070
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:59,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, given the company's own strict confidentiality and notification obligations, I immediately got on a plane for in-person meetings with our publishing partner to discuss the impact on our project.

1071
01:18:59,834 --> 01:19:06,798
[SPEAKER_03]: During that discussion, our partner expressed low confidence that they would be willing to invest the additional resources needed to complete the game.

1072
01:19:06,798 --> 01:19:14,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like it's possible that maybe because these questions were being asked, maybe it

1073
01:19:15,509 --> 01:19:24,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess unveiled some sort of like inner workings of the company and because of that the publisher got cold feet, maybe?

1074
01:19:24,864 --> 01:19:25,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1075
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:51,780
[SPEAKER_10]: but that sucks for them but also I don't know what kind of drama what kind of drama is so much drama I'm I'm very because I'm assuming we're still going to get to find out in the coming week or so so we'll see now they have to hastily update the article to probably contact more people who are going to be even more open to squealing because this whole thing is shut down laid off yeah so

1076
01:19:54,029 --> 01:19:57,150
[SPEAKER_10]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat says Kotaku hasn't shifted to writing guides yet.

1077
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:00,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Not completely, just the retail.

1078
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:02,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been writing lots of guides actually.

1079
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:04,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, they have, but that's not like 100% of what they do.

1080
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:07,192
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a lot of what they do.

1081
01:20:07,192 --> 01:20:16,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like for example, if you happen to look at their site, the second thing on here is like, more Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Dragon Dogma tips.

1082
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:18,035
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1083
01:20:18,035 --> 01:20:18,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ask for this.

1084
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:34,024
[SPEAKER_10]: which interestingly enough I saw a story today about that I guess it's not in our show role but I guess folks are saying that the sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are disappointing?

1085
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we go again with Square Enix.

1086
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:44,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if this is somebody, I don't know if this is them saying it or if it was an investor or somebody saying it, but I guess it's only sold half of what Remake did.

1087
01:20:44,075 --> 01:20:50,583
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're leaving a huge part out when they say that and that is the fact that this game isn't available on the PlayStation 4.

1088
01:20:51,727 --> 01:21:01,769
[SPEAKER_10]: which everybody, you know, or many more people had a PlayStation 4 when, you know, Remake came out than has a PlayStation 5 at this point.

1089
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:04,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think you can still call that.

1090
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:06,470
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a one for one.

1091
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:13,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's definitely some bitter Bettys out there and bitter Bobs about the fact that the game is not multi-platform.

1092
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:17,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I think people want to see this on PC and, you know, Xbox and so on.

1093
01:21:17,952 --> 01:21:23,317
[SPEAKER_10]: because and trying to say, oh, it's not selling as much because this is exclusive.

1094
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:27,401
[SPEAKER_10]: But Bobby says it's an analyst.

1095
01:21:27,401 --> 01:21:31,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So somebody like a Michael Patcher will say, but it's funny.

1096
01:21:31,124 --> 01:21:31,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an analyst.

1097
01:21:31,665 --> 01:21:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make predictions like this now, too.

1098
01:21:33,546 --> 01:21:35,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's equal weight, right?

1099
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:39,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I'm an analyst, then I can I can make all sorts of things here.

1100
01:21:39,952 --> 01:21:41,353
[SPEAKER_10]: We put the anal and analyst.

1101
01:21:41,353 --> 01:21:41,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1102
01:21:42,294 --> 01:21:47,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So as an analyst, I'm going to say that one thing I did notice about Kotaku recently is they've shut off comments.

1103
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:48,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's fun.

1104
01:21:48,859 --> 01:21:50,800
[SPEAKER_03]: No commenting on articles anymore.

1105
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, half the articles are tips now anyway, so it doesn't really matter.

1106
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:56,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's kind of fun.

1107
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:07,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe at some point, these websites will open up tipping because don't we as Americans love to tip?

1108
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:08,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't we love it?

1109
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:15,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't we just love that everywhere you go, there's that question, how much do you want to tip this person?

1110
01:22:15,442 --> 01:22:17,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that, like so much.

1111
01:22:17,844 --> 01:22:25,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that, not that, like, I don't think, like, I get like, you know, certain services should be tippable, but like when they're just like,

1112
01:22:26,881 --> 01:22:36,489
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're just doing an order where there's no special handling, it's just like they're handing you the food that you paid for and stuff like that.

1113
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:43,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even outside of this, I've heard of services where they want you to tip for grocery stores and stuff like that.

1114
01:22:46,277 --> 01:22:48,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a problem with the tipping.

1115
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:57,150
[SPEAKER_10]: What I do have a problem with is that I'm the one expected to tip when the people at the very top are making billions of dollars.

1116
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,353
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the ones that should be fucking tipping.

1117
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:11,863
[SPEAKER_10]: That's who should be leaving the fucking tips, should be the people that are making more money than a person could ever spend in their lifetime, CEO of McDonald's, CEO of Walmart.

1118
01:23:11,863 --> 01:23:15,266
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the person that should be leaving the fucking tips.

1119
01:23:15,266 --> 01:23:17,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's messed up about this.

1120
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:19,610
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is for me.

1121
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:20,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway.

1122
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:44,916
[SPEAKER_10]: A former president of Blizzard, Mike Ibarra, who of course was the president of Blizzard but is no longer there after all the Microsoft stuff went down, has made a suggestion that players should be able to tip developers after completing a game in a tweet saying, I thought about this idea for a while as a player since I've been diving into single player games lately.

1123
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:49,879
[SPEAKER_10]: When I beat a game, there are some that just leave me in awe of how amazing the experience was.

1124
01:23:50,379 --> 01:24:03,229
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of the game, I've often thought I wish I could give these folks another 10 or $20 because it was worth more than my initial $70 and they didn't try to nickel and dime me every second.

1125
01:24:03,229 --> 01:24:08,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring.

1126
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:13,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I know 70 is already a lot, but it's an option at the end of the game I wish I had at times.

1127
01:24:13,598 --> 01:24:14,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Some games are that special.

1128
01:24:15,595 --> 01:24:18,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, did you really play Red Dead Redemption 2?

1129
01:24:18,396 --> 01:24:21,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you not see Red Dead Redemption online?

1130
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:25,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you really saying that Rockstar needs more money from, like, tips?

1131
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:35,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, they have just... It's so money-hungry, like, as it is, and you're like, oh, I paid $70, and I really feel like that they need more.

1132
01:24:35,643 --> 01:24:41,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Boulder's Gate wasn't $70, I don't believe, and, like, it, you know, like...

1133
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:57,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike says, I know most will dislike this idea, but I realize we are tired of tipping and everything else, but I view this different from a pressure to tip type scenario many face and give feedback on.

1134
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:10,062
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think there is some things in what he's saying.

1135
01:25:10,062 --> 01:25:12,423
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep in mind, he's not the president of Blizzard anymore.

1136
01:25:12,423 --> 01:25:15,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's not saying Blizzard games, you should be able to tip the Blizzard people.

1137
01:25:15,764 --> 01:25:17,405
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not really saying that.

1138
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:22,947
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do feel that like, okay, if I enjoy the game, I buy the Battle Pass.

1139
01:25:22,947 --> 01:25:25,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Diablo 4, a Blizzard game, ironically.

1140
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:26,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that series.

1141
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:27,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Diablo 4.

1142
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:33,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought the Battle Pass because I liked the game, which is something that, you know, to me, that's tipping.

1143
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:40,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and but I can also understand that like with indie developers, tipping and so forth is great.

1144
01:25:40,355 --> 01:25:43,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, and help can help folks make ends meet and so forth.

1145
01:25:43,016 --> 01:25:47,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And some do have tip jars set up and maybe it needs to be a little more front and center.

1146
01:25:47,638 --> 01:25:48,859
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1147
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:48,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

1148
01:25:49,977 --> 01:26:03,869
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of the bigger companies, like the Activision specifically, I again think the people on the front lines ought to be being tipped by that money that was given to that fucking cesspool Bobby Kotick when he left.

1149
01:26:03,869 --> 01:26:05,971
[SPEAKER_10]: He got a millions dollar payout.

1150
01:26:05,971 --> 01:26:11,976
[SPEAKER_10]: That should have gone to the artists, the coders, the testers, all that.

1151
01:26:12,717 --> 01:26:15,558
[SPEAKER_10]: that made that game, not fucking Bobby Kotick.

1152
01:26:15,558 --> 01:26:16,618
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't deserve a tip.

1153
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:18,699
[SPEAKER_10]: He deserves a swift boot in the ass.

1154
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:22,100
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what pisses me off about tipping culture.

1155
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:27,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're asking me to tip because you are raking in your pocketing the money they should be getting.

1156
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:29,402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fucked up.

1157
01:26:29,402 --> 01:26:35,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand like where he's I really don't understand where he's coming from, like with that, because where does it stop?

1158
01:26:35,744 --> 01:26:38,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly, with that, it's it's not a

1159
01:26:39,804 --> 01:26:46,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a service that's provided like they've gone out of their way to do something like, you know, super special for you.

1160
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:47,066
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game.

1161
01:26:47,066 --> 01:26:47,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a product.

1162
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:49,447
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'd be like saying?

1163
01:26:49,447 --> 01:26:56,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tipping, you know, the box of cereal that I got, you know, today because it was a box of cereal and I thoroughly enjoyed it or something like that.

1164
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:59,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you imagine if they started doing that?

1165
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:02,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know some indie games do that and that's fine.

1166
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:08,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they have them put in there where like, hey, you can click on this and, you know, buy me a coffee or something like that.

1167
01:27:08,113 --> 01:27:08,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh,

1168
01:27:09,153 --> 01:27:17,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember it was Orna, Orna, I was just gonna bring up Orna, the indie GPS game.

1169
01:27:17,516 --> 01:27:19,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a free game, though.

1170
01:27:19,097 --> 01:27:19,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1171
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:20,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1172
01:27:20,838 --> 01:27:25,940
[SPEAKER_10]: But he built that in you buy me a coffee for $1 a night and it was that you wouldn't get anything out of it.

1173
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Just buy me a coffee.

1174
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And I bet there's a lot of people that did that because they enjoy that game.

1175
01:27:32,422 --> 01:27:34,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and that's a little bit different.

1176
01:27:34,043 --> 01:27:44,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just when we're talking about a $70 game with, you know, a $30 battle pass with, you know, $60 micro... It's not even microtransactions anymore.

1177
01:27:44,111 --> 01:27:46,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosmetics, you know.

1178
01:27:46,132 --> 01:27:54,878
[SPEAKER_03]: What I just heard was that Call of Duty has a stupid King Kong, you know, glove cosmetic that's like $60 in the game.

1179
01:27:54,878 --> 01:27:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and you're still wanting more money?

1180
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:00,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Like... No.

1181
01:28:00,222 --> 01:28:00,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no.

1182
01:28:01,673 --> 01:28:02,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

1183
01:28:02,794 --> 01:28:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thanks.

1184
01:28:03,815 --> 01:28:04,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Not paying you any more money.

1185
01:28:04,995 --> 01:28:10,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew Nami in chat says, I'm reminded of shareware, which I actually kind of get a vibe from that too.

1186
01:28:10,779 --> 01:28:13,821
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're, we're a long ways from those days, right?

1187
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we don't sadly, you know, it's the shareware is the thing of the past.

1188
01:28:17,624 --> 01:28:21,606
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I do remember that like that felt like, like, I enjoyed this demo so much.

1189
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:22,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I want more.

1190
01:28:22,247 --> 01:28:24,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's some money type of thing.

1191
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:25,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to tip like,

1192
01:28:27,339 --> 01:28:29,521
[SPEAKER_07]: the members of the dev team.

1193
01:28:29,521 --> 01:28:36,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd be more open to tip if I if I know that the CEO isn't seeing a fucking dime.

1194
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:39,409
[SPEAKER_10]: That's that's when I'd be willing to tip.

1195
01:28:39,409 --> 01:28:40,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how you do it.

1196
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:44,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You can you can link your your dev teams

1197
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:46,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon

1198
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:05,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how annoying that's going to be?

1199
01:29:05,225 --> 01:29:09,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like those app, hey, have you reviewed this app yet?

1200
01:29:09,108 --> 01:29:13,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's going to be those pop-up reminders like, hey, are you enjoying this game?

1201
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to send us a tip?

1202
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:17,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, obviously you see that you played the game again.

1203
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:18,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to send us a tip?

1204
01:29:18,273 --> 01:29:19,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you want to send us another tip?

1205
01:29:19,774 --> 01:29:23,016
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be worse than the five-star rating prompts, yeah.

1206
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:24,597
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be bad.

1207
01:29:24,597 --> 01:29:25,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not...

1208
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:31,308
[SPEAKER_03]: just what you do is you say, Mike, shut the fuck up.

1209
01:29:31,308 --> 01:29:33,389
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, we don't want to hear from you anymore.

1210
01:29:33,389 --> 01:29:34,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Your ideas are bad.

1211
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep these ideas to yourself, please.

1212
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:37,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1213
01:29:37,451 --> 01:29:37,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1214
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Cosmos even chat says, I wish developers were just paid more for their work.

1215
01:29:41,313 --> 01:29:41,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1216
01:29:41,774 --> 01:29:46,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Fifth dream says, well, if they allow tipping, they'll use this excuse to play and pay employees less.

1217
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:50,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's, that's, that's it.

1218
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:54,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the, the, the money ought to be coming from the top.

1219
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:57,264
[SPEAKER_10]: period, period.

1220
01:29:57,264 --> 01:30:08,035
[SPEAKER_10]: I that's, that's what I am fucking sick of is being asked to tip at these places where the money ought to be coming from the top.

1221
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:09,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1222
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:10,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1223
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,559
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1224
01:30:11,559 --> 01:30:16,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to a little bit of lighthearted fair of some sort.

1225
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:16,965
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1226
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:24,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there are some new additions to Nintendo Switch Online.

1227
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:32,467
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to be getting Amazing Hiberike, Super R-Type, which is pretty fun.

1228
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:33,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Super R-Type.

1229
01:30:33,848 --> 01:30:38,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrecking Crew 98 is also going to be on the list.

1230
01:30:41,514 --> 01:30:45,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I think all of those are pretty, pretty good games.

1231
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:48,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I even have a couple of them, you know.

1232
01:30:48,796 --> 01:31:01,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it'd be really interesting to see how Wrecking Crew 98 and Amazing Hebedeke play out for people in the US.

1233
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:08,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Now these are in Japan, but of course, you know, we have ways of getting them.

1234
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,340
[SPEAKER_07]: We eventually get them.

1235
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:15,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, it's it's cool that they actually put some Japanese games in the US switch online.

1236
01:31:15,522 --> 01:31:16,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's great.

1237
01:31:16,403 --> 01:31:24,586
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the games that didn't have they weren't very text intensive, because like, I remember there was like a P cross update at some point that we got there as well.

1238
01:31:24,586 --> 01:31:25,266
[SPEAKER_10]: But um,

1239
01:31:26,066 --> 01:31:32,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I, you know, remember, it's very, very, very easy to download the Japanese version of Switch Online.

1240
01:31:32,931 --> 01:31:45,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would actually super recommend this for the 8-bit NES, because you can play things like Zelda and Metroid as they were on the Nintendo disc system with the extra sound.

1241
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:50,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I thought playing Nintendo on the Japanese app was really cool, to be honest.

1242
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:54,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, our time had the worst slowdown on the Super Nintendo.

1243
01:31:54,526 --> 01:31:54,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So funny.

1244
01:31:56,129 --> 01:32:00,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but R-Type is a, you know, all the R-Type games are pretty fucking difficult.

1245
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:02,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1246
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:24,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I think that it would be nice though, is that for like some of the RPGs, if they would put out English translations, you know, reach out to some of the fan translators out there and just say, hey, we'll give you X amount of money if you let us just use your translation in the game.

1247
01:32:26,044 --> 01:32:30,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would I thoroughly enjoyed playing.

1248
01:32:30,148 --> 01:32:35,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, well, I mean, Live Alive had its remake, but I really enjoyed playing Treasure of the Rudra.

1249
01:32:35,213 --> 01:32:40,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people would love to play that game, you know, or the original Star Ocean.

1250
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:42,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like original, original Star Ocean on SNES.

1251
01:32:45,307 --> 01:32:46,227
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, let's move on.

1252
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,628
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a few more stories for you.

1253
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:50,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And then yes, we have a classic game of the week this week.

1254
01:32:50,408 --> 01:32:52,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure some of you are very curious.

1255
01:32:52,729 --> 01:33:01,812
[SPEAKER_10]: What on earth could DarkSakura pick for episode 1000 that would be worthy of 1000th episode that hasn't been picked yet?

1256
01:33:01,812 --> 01:33:03,712
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just gonna I'm gonna teach you with this.

1257
01:33:03,712 --> 01:33:06,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen the game and I went No, she did this one.

1258
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:06,933
[SPEAKER_10]: She had to have done this.

1259
01:33:06,933 --> 01:33:07,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And I looked I looked back.

1260
01:33:07,773 --> 01:33:09,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, what?

1261
01:33:09,774 --> 01:33:10,994
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1262
01:33:10,994 --> 01:33:12,575
[SPEAKER_10]: How?

1263
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:13,235
[SPEAKER_10]: How?

1264
01:33:15,109 --> 01:33:17,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo is not done trying to smack down emulator developers.

1265
01:33:17,552 --> 01:33:21,136
[SPEAKER_03]: This time they are coming after Suyu and Sudachi.

1266
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:50,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Discord has shut down everything connected to Suyu and Sudachi.

1267
01:33:50,117 --> 01:33:57,765
[SPEAKER_03]: This includes both the emulator's servers on the platform as well as accounts tied to the developers working on the software.

1268
01:34:04,327 --> 01:34:09,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Discord responds to and complies with all legal and valid DMCA requests.

1269
01:34:09,848 --> 01:34:18,550
[SPEAKER_03]: In this instance, there was also a court-ordered injunction for the takedown of these materials, and we took action in a manner consistent with the court order.

1270
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:31,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Recognize that there was a court order for any of this at least not one that we've heard about yet So are they is there more legal stuff going on outside of just Yuzu?

1271
01:34:31,278 --> 01:34:38,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be curious to find out and according to this You know the what the developers spoke out said

1272
01:34:40,461 --> 01:34:54,826
[SPEAKER_03]: that they received basically an email from Discord saying they were in violation of Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines for allegedly sharing content that violates anyone's intellectual property or other rights.

1273
01:34:56,887 --> 01:35:02,012
[SPEAKER_03]: See them denying that, necessarily.

1274
01:35:02,012 --> 01:35:08,298
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it is kind of interesting that they're coming after just these developers' accounts.

1275
01:35:08,298 --> 01:35:14,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless, like, I could see if there was evidence... Nintendo is madder about this than they are about PAL World, and that really surprised me, to be honest.

1276
01:35:14,344 --> 01:35:15,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so, I mean...

1277
01:35:16,366 --> 01:35:28,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I would see, like, if, so it depends, like, if on these discords, if they were sharing, like, the keys or something like that, or trading games or something, I could see there could be an issue.

1278
01:35:28,573 --> 01:35:40,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it is legit that they don't have any of this stuff on there, it is just support for the emulator, then I think it's kind of an overreach.

1279
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, also, like, what the hell's wrong with Nintendo?

1280
01:35:43,561 --> 01:35:44,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly.

1281
01:35:45,953 --> 01:35:47,954
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do understand.

1282
01:35:47,954 --> 01:35:48,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Push it more underground.

1283
01:35:48,894 --> 01:35:55,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I do understand that like when you're emulating current gen retail stuff, it's a very slippery slope.

1284
01:35:55,577 --> 01:35:58,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And stop making your goddamn consoles based off of old ass tech.

1285
01:35:58,758 --> 01:36:01,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sorry.

1286
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:01,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1287
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:02,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah.

1288
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1289
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:10,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Those decisions that, you know, Nintendo has made come back to bite them sometimes.

1290
01:36:10,843 --> 01:36:13,324
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, that is what it is.

1291
01:36:13,324 --> 01:36:15,025
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

1292
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:19,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's move on.

1293
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:22,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And this has also got a lot of people talking this week.

1294
01:36:22,263 --> 01:36:27,926
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a digital game that has been pulled from people's libraries.

1295
01:36:27,926 --> 01:36:33,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Ubisoft is deleting the crew from players libraries.

1296
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:37,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, here's the thing before you know you overreact a little bit, but I don't know.

1297
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:38,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1298
01:36:38,193 --> 01:36:39,554
[SPEAKER_10]: There's still some things about this I don't like.

1299
01:36:40,854 --> 01:36:46,515
[SPEAKER_10]: The servers were pulled on April 1st anyway, and The Crew was an online-only game.

1300
01:36:46,515 --> 01:36:51,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So essentially, your digital copy of The Crew was worthless at this point.

1301
01:36:51,916 --> 01:36:55,557
[SPEAKER_10]: You couldn't do anything with it besides, I guess, see a title screen and get an error message.

1302
01:36:55,557 --> 01:37:00,818
[SPEAKER_10]: There was really nothing else to experience in this game because there are no more servers.

1303
01:37:00,818 --> 01:37:08,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, Ubisoft Connect, if you had that to launch the game from, the license to play the game has been revoked.

1304
01:37:09,019 --> 01:37:14,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, now people are saying this is illegal, you can't do this.

1305
01:37:14,143 --> 01:37:18,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically, it's probably in the terms of service that you just don't read and accept.

1306
01:37:18,346 --> 01:37:26,872
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure we all kind of go like, I don't, I oftentimes don't like going, well, that's why they did it because it's in the terms of service.

1307
01:37:26,872 --> 01:37:27,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I can accept that.

1308
01:37:27,953 --> 01:37:30,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that is the answer legally.

1309
01:37:30,435 --> 01:37:37,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also don't like sitting here going that they should be allowed to do that, that they should be allowed to put that in there.

1310
01:37:37,901 --> 01:37:40,868
[SPEAKER_10]: and you have to accept it to play the game.

1311
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:45,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there's a part of me that feels like that shouldn't be the system in the first place, to be honest, but...

1312
01:37:46,764 --> 01:37:52,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, um, again, the crew went down the crew to and the crew motor fest are both still going.

1313
01:37:52,526 --> 01:37:59,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you had the crew through at least if you have a physical copy of the game, they can't exactly come into your house and take it.

1314
01:37:59,148 --> 01:37:59,749
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1315
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:05,791
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can't play the digital version of it through the Ubisoft Connect anymore.

1316
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:09,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I think where this is kind of fucked up.

1317
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:14,635
[SPEAKER_10]: is that, like, look at the Pretendo thing we talked about earlier.

1318
01:38:14,635 --> 01:38:18,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the crew has the community to substantiate this.

1319
01:38:18,036 --> 01:38:19,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they do.

1320
01:38:19,397 --> 01:38:23,019
[SPEAKER_10]: But what if somebody wanted to make a different type of server?

1321
01:38:23,019 --> 01:38:29,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did see some talk at our Discord server to acknowledge this, you know, over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, where it's one of those

1322
01:38:30,063 --> 01:38:36,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Essentially, what I'm talking about doing is like those commercials and say, why don't they just turn up the graphics on level three?

1323
01:38:36,747 --> 01:38:45,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It's much harder than that you would you would have to have server code that probably doesn't exist out there and that I get it.

1324
01:38:45,832 --> 01:38:56,998
[SPEAKER_10]: But for that to not even be an option, because that entire thing has been stripped from your library does seem a little bit tacky to me.

1325
01:38:59,204 --> 01:39:08,632
[SPEAKER_10]: If I want a pet rock that is worthless, dammit, let me have my pet rock.

1326
01:39:08,632 --> 01:39:09,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's as simple as that.

1327
01:39:12,589 --> 01:39:18,451
[SPEAKER_10]: YYR says in chat, the timing on this was not an accident.

1328
01:39:18,451 --> 01:39:22,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently someone was about to put a private server online.

1329
01:39:22,412 --> 01:39:24,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so maybe someone did crack the code.

1330
01:39:24,933 --> 01:39:27,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

1331
01:39:27,073 --> 01:39:37,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Terms of Services and ULAs, ULAs, End User License Agreements, have never been actually tested in court because everyone keeps settling.

1332
01:39:38,257 --> 01:39:41,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the bubble is going to burst on that someday.

1333
01:39:41,578 --> 01:39:59,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just talked about it was last week or the week before we talked about how there is a advocacy group that is trying to leverage a French organization to, we'll just say, bully Ubisoft in a way they ought to be bullied to stop doing this shit with, you know, delisting and pulling things.

1334
01:39:59,864 --> 01:40:01,524
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to happen with the crew, too.

1335
01:40:01,524 --> 01:40:06,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to happen at the Crew Motor Fest, like stop buying Ubisoft games.

1336
01:40:06,986 --> 01:40:07,226
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1337
01:40:08,308 --> 01:40:15,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's take an opportunity here on episode 1000 to do something that we have been doing for 750 episodes.

1338
01:40:15,814 --> 01:40:17,895
[SPEAKER_10]: To be fair, the Classic Game of the Week started in episode 250.

1339
01:40:17,895 --> 01:40:21,178
[SPEAKER_10]: As I see, there's been a lot of landmarks along the way.

1340
01:40:21,178 --> 01:40:27,263
[SPEAKER_10]: So 250 was another nice round number, where I think DarkSakura before did like there was like the there's like advice or something.

1341
01:40:27,263 --> 01:40:28,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was the website of the week.

1342
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:29,084
[SPEAKER_10]: That was always fun.

1343
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:30,725
[SPEAKER_06]: and Solicited Advice.

1344
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:33,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and then it switched to the Classic Game of the Week in Episode 250.

1345
01:40:33,767 --> 01:40:35,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's stayed that way ever since.

1346
01:40:35,408 --> 01:40:39,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure a lot of you are curious, what did DarkSakura pick for Episode 1000?

1347
01:40:39,251 --> 01:40:45,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And unlike the game we just talked about, this is something you can go back and play.

1348
01:40:45,175 --> 01:40:48,797
[SPEAKER_10]: This is games preserved the way we like it.

1349
01:40:48,797 --> 01:40:51,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me roll the bumper and then we'll get to the game.

1350
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:09,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1351
01:41:09,817 --> 01:41:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1352
01:41:12,879 --> 01:41:19,063
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, DarkSakura, what'd you pick for Episode 1000 Classic Game of the Week?

1353
01:41:19,063 --> 01:41:21,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked Gradius.

1354
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:23,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done Gradius 2.

1355
01:41:23,326 --> 01:41:24,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done Gradius 3.

1356
01:41:24,567 --> 01:41:27,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not done Gradius.

1357
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:28,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um,

1358
01:41:29,557 --> 01:41:40,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and trust me, I poured over the wiki and just made a thousand percent sure.

1359
01:41:40,326 --> 01:41:55,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And even going back and reading stuff, I was like, I had to recontextualize where I brought up certain things that I'm finding so familiar because I believe I brought up the precursor to Gradius.

1360
01:41:58,263 --> 01:42:04,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought that up talking about Salamander or Lifeforce.

1361
01:42:04,707 --> 01:42:10,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll take a step back and we're gonna go and take that little walk.

1362
01:42:10,952 --> 01:42:16,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So Gradius was released in Japanese arcades on February 2nd, 1985.

1363
01:42:19,518 --> 01:42:25,324
[SPEAKER_07]: North America got it December 1985 and Europe got it September 1985.

1364
01:42:25,324 --> 01:42:30,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is one of those situations where Europe got it before we did.

1365
01:42:30,871 --> 01:42:33,894
[SPEAKER_07]: It was of course developed by Konami.

1366
01:42:33,894 --> 01:42:35,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first in the Gradius series.

1367
01:42:40,706 --> 01:42:45,428
[SPEAKER_07]: The version that was released outside of Japan was under the name Nemesis.

1368
01:42:45,428 --> 01:42:50,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, there have since been revisions back to the original name.

1369
01:42:50,549 --> 01:42:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a Game Boy cartridge that's titled Nemesis.

1370
01:42:56,831 --> 01:43:05,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, it was originally supposed to be a sequel to its precursor, Scramble.

1371
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:11,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and actually the working title was Scramble 2.

1372
01:43:11,152 --> 01:43:14,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but things changed.

1373
01:43:14,754 --> 01:43:21,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, you basically play as the spaceship called the Vic Viper.

1374
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:24,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to go through, you know, enemies.

1375
01:43:24,338 --> 01:43:27,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And you also get the phrase, destroy the core!

1376
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:39,883
[SPEAKER_07]: This game was novel for one very important reason, and that was its option system.

1377
01:43:39,883 --> 01:43:46,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, well, option in particular, but its power-up system including the options and the various lasers.

1378
01:43:47,105 --> 01:43:58,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that one of the lasers actually goes back to an anime that I super enjoyed and always meant to go back and read the books, Lensmen.

1379
01:43:58,967 --> 01:44:02,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get to that in a second.

1380
01:44:02,928 --> 01:44:13,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in other shooters at the time, you would get color-coded power-ups that would have a different effect on your ship.

1381
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:25,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure if you think of like Raiden, where you get the purple, it's electric, you get the red, it's fire, etc.

1382
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:35,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little bit more about the background of this game is that it was created by a game designer named Hiroyasu Machiguchi.

1383
01:44:35,634 --> 01:44:38,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first video game he publicly released.

1384
01:44:39,515 --> 01:44:53,722
[SPEAKER_07]: He joined Konami in the 1980s as a programmer when Konami was transitioning away from producing metal machines, you know, M-E-D-A-L, to doing video game development.

1385
01:44:53,722 --> 01:44:58,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And they wanted him to make a game that would put Konami out there.

1386
01:44:58,945 --> 01:45:00,966
[SPEAKER_07]: It would make, you know, give them their

1387
01:45:02,603 --> 01:45:10,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Leg up in the evolving genre, or I say the evolving media.

1388
01:45:10,295 --> 01:45:16,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, he asked the team what kind of game they'd like to work on.

1389
01:45:18,818 --> 01:45:21,799
[SPEAKER_07]: and they wanted to work on another shooting game.

1390
01:45:21,799 --> 01:45:30,401
[SPEAKER_07]: The shooting game genre had its resurgence with Xevious from Namco and so they wanted to do better.

1391
01:45:30,401 --> 01:45:36,183
[SPEAKER_07]: They took a lot of mechanics and material from Scramble

1392
01:45:37,602 --> 01:45:39,744
[SPEAKER_07]: and put a little bit more into it.

1393
01:45:39,744 --> 01:45:48,209
[SPEAKER_07]: They came up with different ideas that they would just test out whether or not they thought it was going to work.

1394
01:45:48,209 --> 01:45:54,193
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would run it all on an arcade monitor to see how it panned out.

1395
01:45:54,193 --> 01:46:04,120
[SPEAKER_07]: With the options, they had 20 different movement patterns that were, you know, basically whittled down until they found the ones that would work.

1396
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was also produced for the Konami Bubble System.

1397
01:46:09,224 --> 01:46:19,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the Konami bubble system, other things that ran on it were Twinbee and Galactic Warriors.

1398
01:46:19,932 --> 01:46:22,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1399
01:46:22,914 --> 01:46:28,419
[SPEAKER_07]: But they also took some options, options, some ideas that were used in Star Wars.

1400
01:46:28,419 --> 01:46:35,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, Lensman, the laser weapon was actually completely influenced by Lensman.

1401
01:46:37,811 --> 01:46:51,899
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the power meter mechanic where they wanted to give players freedom to select whatever weapons they wanted.

1402
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:56,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was just a big, you know,

1403
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:05,784
[SPEAKER_07]: like way to give people the ultimate sort of satisfying gameplay.

1404
01:47:05,784 --> 01:47:22,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And also they put Moai in the game and they've been in every subsequent game as an homage to Xevious and the Nazca lines that were referenced in Xevious.

1405
01:47:22,133 --> 01:47:24,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So it

1406
01:47:27,409 --> 01:47:34,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like some time to just go into different gaming systems one day, maybe that'll be next year.

1407
01:47:34,097 --> 01:47:39,984
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like this Bubble system or the CPS, stuff like that.

1408
01:47:39,984 --> 01:47:46,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the Bubble system was interesting because it used a Bubble software cartridge.

1409
01:47:47,072 --> 01:48:04,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And it used magnetic bubble memory, which was a sort of NVRAM that had non-volatile RAM that used this magnetic material to hold these bubbles of data.

1410
01:48:04,468 --> 01:48:05,649
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting concept.

1411
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:18,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But moving forward, though, of course, the first home conversion came out for Famicom on April 25th, 1986 in Japan.

1412
01:48:18,334 --> 01:48:21,936
[SPEAKER_07]: It was limited because of the hardware.

1413
01:48:21,936 --> 01:48:28,978
[SPEAKER_07]: There were some designs that were simplified, like the Moai stage, for example.

1414
01:48:28,978 --> 01:48:33,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And the maximum amount of options you could get was two instead of four.

1415
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,901
[SPEAKER_07]: But it did give us the Konami code.

1416
01:48:37,662 --> 01:48:49,052
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first game for it to appear in and followed in subsequent games such as the other Gradius games, Contra, Lifeforce, and to some extent in Parodius.

1417
01:48:49,995 --> 01:48:57,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but with the NES version, um, it came out in North America, December of 1986.

1418
01:48:57,140 --> 01:49:04,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was the first NES game to have been released by Konami in North America.

1419
01:49:04,565 --> 01:49:08,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And the title was kept the same as it was in Japan.

1420
01:49:08,327 --> 01:49:10,189
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't called Nemesis.

1421
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:15,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And Nintendo, um, had it available in arcades as a Nintendo versus system.

1422
01:49:15,832 --> 01:49:19,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was under the title of versus Gradius and a PlayChoice 10 cartridge.

1423
01:49:21,757 --> 01:49:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was also an MSX version, July 25th, 86.

1424
01:49:31,705 --> 01:49:48,519
[SPEAKER_07]: It was changed very similarly to the Famicom version and they added like a bone planet and some different enemies and some warp zones and you could play as a Twinbee.

1425
01:49:49,676 --> 01:49:59,142
[SPEAKER_07]: The PC Engine version was November 15, 1991, exclusively in Japan, and it was a 2 megabit HuCard.

1426
01:49:59,142 --> 01:50:08,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It was closer to the arcade than the NES and MSX, and it had a desert planet stage, kind of like the Bone Planet was added.

1427
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:15,112
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course lower resolution and it had a degree though of vertical scrolling.

1428
01:50:15,112 --> 01:50:26,137
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as other platforms, it came out on various microcomputers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 in Europe as Nemesis the Final Challenge, PC-8801 and X1 in Japan and

1429
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:38,049
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an early version on the X68000, well I say for the early versions of the computer.

1430
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:43,736
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Gradius has been released in the Gradius Deluxe Pack for PlayStation, Saturn, and Windows.

1431
01:50:43,736 --> 01:50:44,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have the Saturn copy.

1432
01:50:45,979 --> 01:51:04,294
[SPEAKER_07]: a Gradius collection for PSP, digital releases for PlayStation 4 and Switch in the Arcade Archive series, and then the Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection from 2019 by Konami was out for PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows.

1433
01:51:04,294 --> 01:51:08,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, the soundtracks have been released.

1434
01:51:08,057 --> 01:51:09,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I have somewhere

1435
01:51:10,723 --> 01:51:16,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Back there, the vinyl record of Gradius and Gradius 2 soundtracks.

1436
01:51:16,954 --> 01:51:19,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you have the Gradius 3 one as well.

1437
01:51:19,058 --> 01:51:19,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah vinyl.

1438
01:51:22,475 --> 01:51:35,759
[SPEAKER_07]: But the game in the arcade went on to be the fifth highest grossing arcade machine of 1986 in Japan.

1439
01:51:35,759 --> 01:51:43,281
[SPEAKER_07]: In the UK, Nemesis was the highest grossing arcade game in 1986 on London's Electrocoin charts.

1440
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:48,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And it got really stunning reviews across the board for the arcade version.

1441
01:51:48,663 --> 01:51:49,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, you know,

1442
01:51:50,243 --> 01:51:52,784
[SPEAKER_07]: It was up there.

1443
01:51:52,784 --> 01:51:58,946
[SPEAKER_07]: For the ports, the Famicom version sold over a million copies in Japan in 1986.

1444
01:51:58,946 --> 01:52:06,928
[SPEAKER_07]: The home computer port went to number 2 in the UK, and the game that beat it was Feud.

1445
01:52:06,928 --> 01:52:09,849
[SPEAKER_07]: PC Engine also topped the UK's PC Engine sales.

1446
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:15,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And it got the first Famitsu Best Hit Game Award.

1447
01:52:15,895 --> 01:52:23,224
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave it to Famicom, the Famicom version is the best shooting game and listed the second best game of the year, just below Dragon Quest.

1448
01:52:26,169 --> 01:52:29,591
[SPEAKER_07]: This has done many sequels.

1449
01:52:29,591 --> 01:52:36,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now on the seventh generation of Gradius games with Gradius Rebirth.

1450
01:52:36,135 --> 01:52:38,156
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, there was, you know, Salamander.

1451
01:52:38,156 --> 01:52:43,879
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also re-released on the Windows Store in 2013.

1452
01:52:43,879 --> 01:52:47,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And the NES port, of course, came out on Switch.

1453
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:52,064
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's an updated release as a Gradius Stage 5 Stronger version.

1454
01:52:53,365 --> 01:52:56,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That came out November 14th, 2018, worldwide.

1455
01:52:56,970 --> 01:53:02,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Gradius SP Second Loop, that also came out.

1456
01:53:02,138 --> 01:53:04,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

1457
01:53:04,622 --> 01:53:06,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Gradius.

1458
01:53:09,773 --> 01:53:10,053
[SPEAKER_10]: just to

1459
01:53:33,211 --> 01:53:35,793
[SPEAKER_10]: BDR, and Beatmania 2DX, to be honest.

1460
01:53:35,793 --> 01:53:44,560
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, yeah, and Orange Rite says it gave us Gradius full speed, which for a long time we were using as the theme to the Orange Zones Radio To Go edition, uh, at the very beginning.

1461
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,942
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very good call out, Orange Rite, thank you.

1462
01:53:46,942 --> 01:53:59,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be remembered that, if I recall correctly, the first Gradius song, or reference to Gradius as a song that came out in the Bimani game, was, uh, Gradius Xyber.

1463
01:53:59,793 --> 01:54:01,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

1464
01:54:01,393 --> 01:54:04,674
[SPEAKER_10]: That was in a 5KB video game, right?

1465
01:54:04,674 --> 01:54:05,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe so.

1466
01:54:05,795 --> 01:54:11,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, there was also... I want to say there was a Salamander song.

1467
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:14,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there was the Metal Gear one.

1468
01:54:14,317 --> 01:54:24,220
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that was... I mean, for me, it was among the first shooters I ever played.

1469
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:26,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I played Galaga and Galaxian.

1470
01:54:27,748 --> 01:54:30,997
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, yeah, that was SalamanderBeatCrushMix.

1471
01:54:35,358 --> 01:54:41,884
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just up there in my list of games that I will just pick up and play through.

1472
01:54:41,884 --> 01:54:44,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the other things that spawned.

1473
01:54:44,106 --> 01:54:52,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you think about it, the game spawned other games apart from just in the Gradius series.

1474
01:54:52,934 --> 01:54:57,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the whole Parodia series.

1475
01:54:57,237 --> 01:55:02,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, the system that was on also ran Twinbee.

1476
01:55:03,556 --> 01:55:10,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And Twinbee, you know, that led us to a whole series of other games as well.

1477
01:55:10,605 --> 01:55:15,310
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just really, I can't say enough enough about it.

1478
01:55:15,310 --> 01:55:22,138
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game that has definitely shaped what we think of when we come to a shooter for the most part.

1479
01:55:23,885 --> 01:55:27,808
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely a formative game for so many of us in history.

1480
01:55:27,808 --> 01:55:31,010
[SPEAKER_10]: A great pick for episode 1000 here on Orange Launch Radio.

1481
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:32,371
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna get into some rapid fire news.

1482
01:55:32,371 --> 01:55:52,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to take a moment to do a personal hijack of the show and I apologize for this, but I also don't because during the segment that DarkSakura was just doing, I just got a text message from my dad who just texted, I'm trying to show this in a way that doesn't give away, there we go, that says, congrats on your 1000th show.

1483
01:55:54,286 --> 01:55:58,595
[SPEAKER_10]: You're old man, but I don't know if it's an autocorrect thing or maybe it was intended.

1484
01:55:58,595 --> 01:56:02,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually says Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.

1485
01:56:02,062 --> 01:56:02,843
[SPEAKER_10]: You're old man.

1486
01:56:06,966 --> 01:56:15,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, my dad could have meant that either way, to be quite honest.

1487
01:56:15,368 --> 01:56:17,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you, Dad, if you're out there still watching.

1488
01:56:17,388 --> 01:56:18,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

1489
01:56:18,829 --> 01:56:22,449
[SPEAKER_10]: He knows how to fire up Twitch on his iPad and watch, so I appreciate it.

1490
01:56:22,449 --> 01:56:29,611
[SPEAKER_10]: So my dad is in his mid-80s, so he's doing great.

1491
01:56:29,611 --> 01:56:34,992
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, he just had eye surgery a couple weeks ago, and he's doing great.

1492
01:56:35,552 --> 01:56:36,852
[SPEAKER_10]: So Cataracts?

1493
01:56:36,852 --> 01:56:38,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was Cataracts.

1494
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:38,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very, very routine.

1495
01:56:38,713 --> 01:56:41,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Or as my grandmother would say, the Cadillacs.

1496
01:56:41,094 --> 01:56:41,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1497
01:56:41,734 --> 01:56:42,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1498
01:56:42,054 --> 01:56:53,337
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, I'm sure he appreciates that I'm spreading all of his business here on the show, but I am admiring how fast he bounced back from the whole thing and now has that bionic vision, you know, with it.

1499
01:56:53,337 --> 01:56:57,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think when they're in there doing that, they also kind of touch up the eyes as well.

1500
01:56:57,378 --> 01:56:58,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he sees even better now.

1501
01:56:58,719 --> 01:56:59,879
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty cool.

1502
01:56:59,879 --> 01:57:03,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they don't like add technology to it, so.

1503
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:03,140
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1504
01:57:04,249 --> 01:57:13,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines going on in the industry.

1505
01:57:13,363 --> 01:57:14,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki we'll go to you.

1506
01:57:15,549 --> 01:57:25,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Fallout 4 is going to be getting a next-gen update rolling out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and sort of PC on April 25th.

1507
01:57:25,874 --> 01:57:37,518
[SPEAKER_03]: As part of that, they're going to receive their own native apps on both platforms, including a 60fps mode, which is going to be

1508
01:57:39,259 --> 01:57:45,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the Xbox version already technically has on the X and S, but they're going to have a native version of that.

1509
01:57:45,585 --> 01:57:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Performance and quality modes as well.

1510
01:57:48,407 --> 01:57:54,292
[SPEAKER_03]: PC players are going to be getting widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, as well as updates to quests.

1511
01:57:54,292 --> 01:58:04,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even have a brand new Fallout 4 Enclave-centered quest that's going to be coming via the Creation Club.

1512
01:58:05,242 --> 01:58:06,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Loki, I like your purple cat ears.

1513
01:58:06,643 --> 01:58:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: The windows that are behind your head on the train.

1514
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:38,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got some classic SNK games that are now coming to Good Old Games.

1515
01:58:38,293 --> 01:58:43,835
[SPEAKER_03]: These are, of course, including lots of your favorites.

1516
01:58:43,835 --> 01:58:46,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So, King of Fighters 97, King of Fighters 2003, we have Metal Slug 4, Magician Lord, Last Resort,

01:59:04,224 --> 01:59:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 389 each.

1519
01:59:06,466 --> 01:59:08,188
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a euro.

1520
01:59:08,188 --> 01:59:12,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure what that translates to in the US, but cool.

1521
01:59:12,992 --> 01:59:16,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably already have these several times over considering, you know, Twitch.

1522
01:59:16,695 --> 01:59:20,539
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave them away on Twitch some time ago with Amazon Games.

1523
01:59:20,539 --> 01:59:21,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitch and Steam.

1524
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:25,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a cartridge of Magician Lord and KOF 2000 and

1525
01:59:27,856 --> 01:59:29,176
[SPEAKER_07]: some of those games, yeah.

1526
01:59:29,176 --> 01:59:41,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a multi-cart, but I believe Bobby has that multi-cart now for the Neo Geo, because I think I gave that to him with the super gun, so yes.

1527
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:42,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he does.

1528
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:43,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1529
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that thing.

1530
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:46,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1531
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, DarkSakura.

1532
01:59:48,481 --> 01:59:49,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Whale.

1533
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:52,182
[SPEAKER_07]: A relic from our past has returned.

1534
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:54,681
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Sunsoft!

1535
01:59:54,681 --> 02:00:00,465
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a retro game selection launching on April 18th in Japan for Switch and PC.

1536
02:00:00,465 --> 02:00:04,948
[SPEAKER_07]: There will also be an English release planned.

1537
02:00:04,948 --> 02:00:21,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the games that are listed for these titles are going to be The Wing of Madula, Firework Thrower, Kantaro, 53 Stations of the Tokaido, and Ripple Island.

1538
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:22,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm...

1539
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:25,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty happy about that.

1540
02:00:25,222 --> 02:00:26,022
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna be cute.

1541
02:00:26,022 --> 02:00:30,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

1542
02:00:30,346 --> 02:00:30,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1543
02:00:31,522 --> 02:00:36,206
[SPEAKER_10]: All those Sunsoft classics to me are things like Blaster Master, Fester's Quest, but that's okay.

1544
02:00:36,206 --> 02:00:38,849
[SPEAKER_10]: These will be cool too.

1545
02:00:38,849 --> 02:00:49,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Y'all might remember that for the holidays this year, I got an Evercade, and unfortunately, it turns out there are some Evercade cartridges that are going out of print.

1546
02:00:49,438 --> 02:00:55,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Legacy Cart is when the license to produce the cartridge is expired, so they may not produce more stock of the cartridge.

1547
02:00:56,324 --> 02:00:57,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Codemasters Collection 1

1548
02:01:15,589 --> 02:01:19,090
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's that one and then Technos Arcade 1 is also being pulled.

1549
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:22,791
[SPEAKER_10]: The Technos Arcade 1 had a Double Dragon 2 in it.

1550
02:01:22,791 --> 02:01:27,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think one of the Weltris clones or something was in this as well.

1551
02:01:27,873 --> 02:01:33,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So this one, the Technos Arcade 1 will not disappear until June.

1552
02:01:33,755 --> 02:01:36,136
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm guessing that's when their license agreement is up or whatever.

1553
02:01:36,136 --> 02:01:39,497
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a heads up for you Evercade collectors.

1554
02:01:40,296 --> 02:01:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recognize a lot of it.

1555
02:01:41,962 --> 02:01:45,834
[SPEAKER_03]: They had so the pinball game that was in that was psycho pinball.

1556
02:01:51,950 --> 02:02:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimate Stuntman, Sensible Soccer, Stunt Buggy, Super Skid Marks, Tennis All Stars, Linus Space Head, Megalomania, Mig-29 Soviet Fighter, Psycho Pinball, CJ's Elephant Antics, Cannon Father, Cosmic Space Head, F-16 Renegade, Boomerang Kid, Big Nose the Caveman, Big Nose Freaks Out and B-52

1557
02:02:12,048 --> 02:02:13,849
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only a couple of those I've heard of.

1558
02:02:13,849 --> 02:02:19,410
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think these are all games that were much bigger overseas in Britain, because you know, Codemasters is huge.

1559
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:22,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think and that's I think we're Codemasters is based too.

1560
02:02:22,091 --> 02:02:23,631
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's probably a little bigger.

1561
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:25,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the Evercades even are done over there.

1562
02:02:25,612 --> 02:02:28,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a little bit of bigger deal.

1563
02:02:28,073 --> 02:02:29,713
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like sensible soccer.

1564
02:02:29,713 --> 02:02:32,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I recognize that, believe it or not, and a few of those others too.

1565
02:02:32,834 --> 02:02:35,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, sounds like it'd be a good collection.

1566
02:02:36,547 --> 02:02:38,989
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a cartridge this retired I really want.

1567
02:02:38,989 --> 02:02:43,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I talked about this on a prior episode, but it's the one that has fucking Dragon's View on it.

1568
02:02:43,613 --> 02:02:46,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon 2, Dragon's View, like the Super Nintendo is on it.

1569
02:02:46,235 --> 02:02:48,277
[SPEAKER_10]: And like, I think that's such an underrated game.

1570
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:52,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, it's it was like $90 on eBay.

1571
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:55,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, Okay, I want it, but I don't want it that much.

1572
02:02:55,202 --> 02:02:56,684
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1573
02:02:56,684 --> 02:03:03,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into some world release dates and talk about some other games coming out this week.

1574
02:03:03,349 --> 02:03:04,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to Loki in the US.

1575
02:03:04,890 --> 02:03:05,671
[SPEAKER_10]: What's coming out this week?

1576
02:03:06,826 --> 02:03:07,747
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

1577
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:10,609
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Europa on PC.

1578
02:03:10,609 --> 02:03:16,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Grounded, I guess, is coming out of Early Access on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1579
02:03:16,934 --> 02:03:22,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Planet of Lana on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1580
02:03:22,138 --> 02:03:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Whisker Waters on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5.

1581
02:03:27,421 --> 02:03:31,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And Soul Covenant on PC and PlayStation 5.

1582
02:03:31,605 --> 02:03:33,026
[SPEAKER_03]: No Xbox games this week.

1583
02:03:33,026 --> 02:03:33,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprising.

1584
02:03:34,927 --> 02:04:00,072
[SPEAKER_10]: all right traveling to japan uh on the nintendo switch this week there's only one game coming out and that's uh uh doke yusei bang in summer cs version that is it and it is uh in summer it it looks like a it's it's got school girls all over the cover it's that kind of game so that's available on the switch if that's what you want next week by the way not to spoil things too much but next week is iuden chronicles release

1585
02:04:01,113 --> 02:04:04,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And that has been a very interesting thing from what I hear.

1586
02:04:04,817 --> 02:04:11,764
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of issues with the physical shipment of that game, especially if you're not in like the US, Japan, like certain countries.

1587
02:04:11,764 --> 02:04:17,991
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, now that even though you donated to Kickstarter, if you want your physical edition, you basically have to pay for it to be shipped to you.

1588
02:04:19,092 --> 02:04:22,235
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's causing some ruffled feathers.

1589
02:04:22,235 --> 02:04:27,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm kind of going, you know what, I'm glad I got the digital version, to be quite honest, because the shipping is very expensive.

1590
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:31,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So it just sounds like their fulfillment is leaving stuff to be desired.

1591
02:04:31,743 --> 02:04:35,866
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm looking forward to playing the game in a few weeks.

1592
02:04:35,866 --> 02:04:37,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Or actually, probably next week, to be honest.

1593
02:04:37,447 --> 02:04:39,589
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think digital will be three days before.

1594
02:04:39,589 --> 02:04:40,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So that will be the 20th.

1595
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:41,690
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is within the next week.

1596
02:04:41,690 --> 02:04:43,272
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be before next week's show.

1597
02:04:44,192 --> 02:04:46,934
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, on the PlayStation 5, we have a couple games.

1598
02:04:46,934 --> 02:05:02,284
[SPEAKER_10]: We have UFO Robot Grandizer, The Feast of the Wolves is out in Japan, and one other release, a multi-language edition, so which includes Japanese, I assume, of Ark Survival Ascended, a PlayStation 5 retail version of

1599
02:05:02,884 --> 02:05:28,500
[SPEAKER_10]: the ARK game survival game that's a classic I have friends that play Ingress some lady friends of mine that are they are super in ARK they love ARK they try to get me to keep playing ARK but I don't think ARK is cross platform is the problem and I have ARK on game pass so I'm like let's play on Xbox but I think they have the switch version or something like that so we're not able to play ARK unfortunately but yeah all right how about the UK DarkSakura?

1600
02:05:31,403 --> 02:05:35,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way, my mom just says really cool on a thousand episodes.

1601
02:05:35,424 --> 02:05:35,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yay.

1602
02:05:35,924 --> 02:05:36,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1603
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1604
02:05:38,765 --> 02:05:41,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So just three things on the list.

1605
02:05:41,065 --> 02:05:44,746
[SPEAKER_07]: All on my birthday.

1606
02:05:44,746 --> 02:05:46,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of these are on Switches.

1607
02:05:46,307 --> 02:05:51,128
[SPEAKER_07]: World War Z and Farming Simulator Kids.

1608
02:05:51,128 --> 02:05:54,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for PlayStation and Xbox is Dragon Ball FighterZ.

1609
02:05:56,892 --> 02:05:58,933
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so somewhat of a slow week.

1610
02:05:58,933 --> 02:05:59,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1611
02:05:59,773 --> 02:06:01,614
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's do just a few more stories.

1612
02:06:01,614 --> 02:06:03,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll get into the roundtable.

1613
02:06:03,154 --> 02:06:04,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I saw some emails come in during the show.

1614
02:06:04,975 --> 02:06:06,416
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a few things to read.

1615
02:06:06,416 --> 02:06:09,097
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure we'll try to get your chat comments.

1616
02:06:09,097 --> 02:06:11,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to guarantee we get all the calls.

1617
02:06:11,258 --> 02:06:12,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many we're gonna have tonight.

1618
02:06:12,578 --> 02:06:13,939
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll we'll do our best.

1619
02:06:13,939 --> 02:06:15,559
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

1620
02:06:15,559 --> 02:06:17,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to it.

1621
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:18,661
[SPEAKER_10]: First some stories.

1622
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:19,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Two more stories.

1623
02:06:19,301 --> 02:06:19,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1624
02:06:20,523 --> 02:06:33,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently some fans of Disney Speedstorm are now considering legal action because apparently Gameloft has changed how you can purchase the Battle Passes in-game.

1625
02:06:33,355 --> 02:06:36,578
[SPEAKER_10]: So originally... Well, one angry Redditor is threatening legal action.

1626
02:06:36,578 --> 02:06:38,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one angry person.

1627
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one person.

1628
02:06:41,348 --> 02:06:43,450
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1629
02:06:59,745 --> 02:07:11,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, it used to be that you could purchase that with just tokens, so you could actually unlock that without spending real money, which is counter to what Gameloft is trying to get you to do, which is to spend real-world money on it.

1630
02:07:11,856 --> 02:07:17,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, the Golden Pass will only be obtainable through direct purchase of $9.99 or $19.99 with a tier skip.

1631
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:18,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is effective starting the 17th of April.

1632
02:07:26,849 --> 02:07:31,193
[SPEAKER_10]: If you really want to stick it to Disney, uninstall.

1633
02:07:31,193 --> 02:07:33,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried Speedstorm, it was okay.

1634
02:07:33,615 --> 02:07:36,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, there's other games out there.

1635
02:07:36,718 --> 02:07:43,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was browsing through my Twitch stuff, I saw that, you know, Smurf Kart is a thing.

1636
02:07:43,384 --> 02:07:47,068
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can jump on Smurf Kart, you know?

1637
02:07:47,068 --> 02:07:47,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's the day.

1638
02:07:47,868 --> 02:07:49,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Be your inner Gargamel.

1639
02:07:49,009 --> 02:07:49,770
[SPEAKER_06]: How about not?

1640
02:07:51,843 --> 02:07:52,323
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1641
02:07:52,323 --> 02:07:52,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

1642
02:07:52,844 --> 02:07:54,305
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't be playing Smurf Kart.

1643
02:07:54,305 --> 02:07:55,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Garfield Kart's where it's at.

1644
02:07:55,485 --> 02:07:56,386
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1645
02:07:56,386 --> 02:07:56,846
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1646
02:07:56,846 --> 02:07:57,627
[SPEAKER_06]: How about not?

1647
02:07:57,627 --> 02:07:58,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Not on Mondays.

1648
02:07:58,587 --> 02:08:00,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate Mondays.

1649
02:08:00,609 --> 02:08:02,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Nermal!

1650
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:03,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget about Garfield.

1651
02:08:03,771 --> 02:08:07,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give me the lasagna and let me watch some Garfield without Garfield.

1652
02:08:07,653 --> 02:08:08,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen to that.

1653
02:08:08,974 --> 02:08:13,217
[SPEAKER_10]: How about just, yeah, instead of playing Garfield Kart, eat lasagna.

1654
02:08:13,217 --> 02:08:14,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Eat lasagna.

1655
02:08:14,157 --> 02:08:16,019
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll make you happier.

1656
02:08:16,019 --> 02:08:19,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Lasagna Kart.

1657
02:08:19,941 --> 02:08:20,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1658
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:29,046
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1659
02:08:41,832 --> 02:08:42,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1660
02:08:42,573 --> 02:08:50,377
[SPEAKER_10]: YYR says my wife, the librarian says there's actually been an uptick in requests for Garfield books lately.

1661
02:08:50,377 --> 02:08:51,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Not sure what brought that on.

1662
02:08:51,318 --> 02:08:52,198
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a movie coming out.

1663
02:08:52,198 --> 02:08:53,960
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a movie coming out.

1664
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:54,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's right.

02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Another animated movie.

1666
02:08:56,021 --> 02:08:59,403
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like rebooting Garfield movies again, right?

1667
02:08:59,403 --> 02:09:02,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because that's what people want.

1668
02:09:02,825 --> 02:09:04,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just go back and read the old Bloom County.

1669
02:09:04,966 --> 02:09:06,227
[SPEAKER_10]: How about US Acres?

1670
02:09:06,227 --> 02:09:08,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's their movie?

1671
02:09:08,529 --> 02:09:08,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone?

1672
02:09:09,491 --> 02:09:13,215
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've had voice talent from the cartoon here on this show.

1673
02:09:13,215 --> 02:09:13,916
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1674
02:09:13,916 --> 02:09:14,616
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1675
02:09:14,616 --> 02:09:15,637
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a long time ago.

1676
02:09:15,637 --> 02:09:16,358
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

1677
02:09:16,358 --> 02:09:17,499
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1678
02:09:17,499 --> 02:09:18,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to one more.

1679
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:25,348
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, for the last official story tonight, I thought it would be appropriate to talk about indies, you know, because we're

1680
02:09:25,908 --> 02:09:49,045
[SPEAKER_10]: an indie podcast and we're always big on support other independent podcasters and independent games are very important part of this industry and that's what made this triple I initiative thing so great to take on the triple A and they did a big 45 minute showcase this week and you know what it was fucking full of announcements because what they did they just they they cut the shit

1681
02:09:49,665 --> 02:09:53,308
[SPEAKER_10]: and they just did trailer, trailer, trailer, trailer, trailer.

1682
02:09:53,308 --> 02:09:56,311
[SPEAKER_10]: So from this triple I initiative, you may have heard of some of these things.

1683
02:09:56,311 --> 02:09:58,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to run through some of these things very quickly.

1684
02:09:58,372 --> 02:10:00,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Slay the Spire 2.

1685
02:10:00,274 --> 02:10:00,994

[SPEAKER_10]: Gestalt Steam and Cylinder has a release date of May 21st.

1691
02:10:19,363 --> 02:10:21,244
[SPEAKER_10]: This is fucking rad.

1692
02:10:21,244 --> 02:10:25,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Vampire Survi- I literally don't know how this is happening.

1693
02:10:25,065 --> 02:10:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Vampire Survivors is getting Contra characters with like guns.

1694
02:10:29,887 --> 02:10:30,527
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1695
02:10:30,527 --> 02:10:31,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Officially.

1696
02:10:31,228 --> 02:10:32,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That is awesome.

1697
02:10:32,328 --> 02:10:32,428
[SPEAKER_09]: It's

1698
02:10:32,768 --> 02:10:42,255
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the wild thing because for all the talk about lifted art from Castlevania and all this stuff that that game, it's official Konami license.

1699
02:10:42,255 --> 02:10:46,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So Contra is coming officially, which is, it's wild.

1700
02:10:46,538 --> 02:10:47,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is so cool.

1701
02:10:49,281 --> 02:10:52,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, even what if they got smash TV stuff?

1702
02:10:52,683 --> 02:11:00,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what also cracks me up, even though most people blasted Contra hardcore, except for Dark Tetsuya, this one's for you.

1703
02:11:00,929 --> 02:11:10,355
[SPEAKER_10]: They are bringing Brad Fang, the wolf kind of character that fits the theme of vampire survivors into this pack as well, which is is wild.

1704
02:11:10,355 --> 02:11:13,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Operation Guns for vampire survivors.

1705

1707
02:11:20,742 --> 02:11:25,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Undermine 2 was announced as part of this as well.

1708
02:11:25,724 --> 02:11:36,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I did a double take when I heard about the game called What the Car, because I remember you were developing a game called Time to Car, that like many games got canceled.

1709
02:11:36,970 --> 02:11:40,952
[SPEAKER_10]: But What the Car, which is different, it's different, but it's coming up.

1710
02:11:40,952 --> 02:11:45,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, what the car is what I'd envisioned it's Time to Car would have been.

1711
02:11:46,536 --> 02:11:47,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1712
02:11:59,468 --> 02:11:59,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Norland

1713
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:36,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, appropriately, it's a sci-fi game about graffiti artists, and it is coming out summer of 2024.

1714
02:12:36,167 --> 02:12:43,415
[SPEAKER_10]: An update for Raven's Watch called Fall of Avalon is coming out on April 22nd, so very soon.

1715
02:12:43,415 --> 02:12:51,083
[SPEAKER_10]: RPG The Last Spell, a tactical game, is getting some DLC called Dwarves of Runenberg, and that comes out on April 24th.

1716
02:12:52,364 --> 02:12:58,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Cat Quest 3, it's coming and it's going to have more than three cats and apparently some ghosts.

1717
02:12:58,175 --> 02:13:00,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Why Cat Quest has ghosts?

1718
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:01,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up and play the game.

1719
02:13:01,501 --> 02:13:02,783
[SPEAKER_07]: What else are the cats going to stare at?

1720
02:13:02,783 --> 02:13:04,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up and play the game.

1721
02:13:04,046 --> 02:13:04,306
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1722
02:13:06,484 --> 02:13:09,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Brotato, Abyssal Terrors, Couch Co-op, Behind the Throne, Old World

1723
02:13:22,378 --> 02:13:25,723
[SPEAKER_10]: gets this expansion coming on May 28th.

1724
02:13:25,723 --> 02:13:37,518
[SPEAKER_10]: POW World showed up in this because POW World is still, I mean, despite its rampant success, is considered an indie, and the Arena multiplayer made a little teaser in the showcase and is coming out this year.

1725
02:13:37,518 --> 02:13:39,701
[SPEAKER_10]: That won't make Nintendo upset whatsoever.

1726
02:13:41,783 --> 02:14:06,977
[SPEAKER_10]: 33 Immortals is moving into a closed beta on May 24th Wizard of Legend 2, well I remember the play in the first one of these That is, had some more footage shown, some gameplay, but no date of that just yet And then Leisara Summit Kingdom came out in early access as of the announcement It's a mountain city builder, and it was a stealth drop for this

1727
02:14:09,398 --> 02:14:13,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Crossover DLC Rising Castlevania Never Alone 2

1728
02:14:31,827 --> 02:14:37,771
[SPEAKER_10]: indigenous culture, and this sequel is coming out, which is very cool.

1729
02:14:37,771 --> 02:14:45,976
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if you would really consider this indie because it's published by Ubisoft, but I think it's because of the brand.

1730
02:14:45,976 --> 02:14:56,163
[SPEAKER_10]: The Dead Cells developers have announced the Rogue Prince of Persia, a roguelite that combines wall running with Arkham style agile combat.

1731
02:14:57,825 --> 02:14:59,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Prince of Persia meets Dead Cells

1732
02:15:14,943 --> 02:15:19,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was it for all the stories we had slotted tonight.

1733
02:15:19,245 --> 02:15:23,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if there's last-minute stories, but first, we're going to go to the listener roundtable.

1734
02:15:23,347 --> 02:15:27,089
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have some extra questions you want to ask, put them in chat.

1735
02:15:27,089 --> 02:15:30,070
[SPEAKER_10]: You bump them if I haven't seen them yet.

1736
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:33,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, you guys have been very chatty tonight, which I deeply appreciate.

1737
02:15:33,312 --> 02:15:34,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you all for being here.

1738
02:15:34,452 --> 02:15:37,234
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had, obviously, the landmark episode number.

1739
02:15:37,234 --> 02:15:40,235
[SPEAKER_10]: We have more viewers tonight than we often have, so thank you, thank you.

1740
02:15:40,235 --> 02:15:41,856
[SPEAKER_10]: It is making it a little harder to stay on top of chat.

1741
02:15:41,856 --> 02:15:42,596
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're all appreciated.

1742
02:15:42,596 --> 02:15:43,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you all are appreciated.

1743
02:15:43,877 --> 02:15:44,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, thank you.

1744
02:15:45,537 --> 02:15:50,578
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura says, I did really dig Dead Cells, so I'm kind of intrigued about their take on Prince of Persia.

1745
02:15:50,578 --> 02:15:51,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, for sure.

1746
02:15:51,058 --> 02:15:52,579
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked really interesting.

1747
02:15:52,579 --> 02:15:53,159
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1748
02:15:53,159 --> 02:15:54,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we do have some emails tonight.

1749
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:57,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Participate at OrangeTonTrader.com is the place to send emails.

1750
02:15:57,580 --> 02:16:00,120
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have some tonight, believe it or not.

1751
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That we do.

1752
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:06,841
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an entire two of them, which is a thousand percent more than we normally have.

1753
02:16:06,841 --> 02:16:08,782
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1754
02:16:08,782 --> 02:16:13,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So at any rate, God, if the email will freaking open, please open.

1755
02:16:13,183 --> 02:16:13,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Email.

1756
02:16:13,863 --> 02:16:14,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1757
02:16:16,150 --> 02:16:18,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, LR.

1758
02:16:18,792 --> 02:16:32,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping to have something special to announce for this very special occasion, like a two-player deathmatch sequel to Pixel Poops called Pixel Poops Double Duty, or the Tempest-inspired spinoff that Jamie asked for called Vecterds.

1759
02:16:33,147 --> 02:16:36,268
[SPEAKER_07]: or perhaps some other unannounced future classic.

1760
02:16:36,268 --> 02:16:41,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But since I've been laser focused on my super multitasking project, I haven't had time for much else.

1761
02:16:41,449 --> 02:16:46,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just say congratulations on reaching this super amazing milestone.

1762
02:16:46,210 --> 02:16:52,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And also thank you for the massive amount of effort required to bring us the show over these last 22-ish years.

1763
02:16:53,292 --> 02:17:02,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can speak for many of your devoted fan base when I say we will gladly sit around your dinner table with you as long as you'll keep inviting us out.

1764
02:17:02,337 --> 02:17:04,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you, and thank you again.

1765
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:09,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to take up too much time tonight, but I'll leave you with this.

1766
02:17:09,281 --> 02:17:14,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there'll be talk about how old the show is, how old you all are, and so on.

1767
02:17:14,544 --> 02:17:22,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of old, last night at Coachella, No Doubt came out on stage, and they put on one of the greatest sets that the festival has ever seen.

1768
02:17:22,588 --> 02:17:26,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Gwen Stefani bounced around the stage and belted out the hits just like she was in her 20s.

1769
02:17:26,672 --> 02:17:30,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have never guessed that she is, in fact, 54 years old.

1770
02:17:30,755 --> 02:17:34,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But she's a shining example of being young at heart, just like the three of you.

1771
02:17:34,538 --> 02:17:38,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And OLR is great listening every week, as good as it's ever been.

1772
02:17:38,642 --> 02:17:41,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks again, and stay young at heart.

1773
02:17:41,404 --> 02:17:46,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you get the chance, seriously, check out the replay of the No Doubt set.

1774
02:17:46,309 --> 02:17:47,430
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so, so good.

1775
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great week and thanks a thousand times over Aaron YYR.

1776
02:17:53,272 --> 02:17:57,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, very good call out about Gwen Stefani and age being just a number.

1777
02:17:57,693 --> 02:18:00,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Gwen in her Vegas show, I think 2019.

1778
02:18:00,114 --> 02:18:04,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was five years ago, but still, you know, she was pushing 50 at that point.

1779
02:18:04,875 --> 02:18:06,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, very high energy show was great.

1780
02:18:06,876 --> 02:18:16,599
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when I think about like artists, you know, that are what some would consider old that are still doing very, very high energy stuff, Madonna.

1781
02:18:17,219 --> 02:18:19,080
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1782
02:18:31,886 --> 02:18:39,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all of her joints are officially made of titanium and mallet rubber.

1783
02:18:39,871 --> 02:18:40,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1784
02:18:40,531 --> 02:18:49,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and then, of course, Cher, for God's sakes, you know, she might not really be dancing in the same, but the fact that she does what she does, she's in her 70s.

1785
02:18:49,537 --> 02:18:50,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, she's Cher.

1786
02:18:50,838 --> 02:18:51,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Cher, bitch.

1787
02:18:51,799 --> 02:18:54,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she's she's fantastic.

1788
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:58,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, you're never too old, right?

1789
02:18:58,863 --> 02:19:07,308
[SPEAKER_07]: To paraphrase Chad Michaels, I honestly think she has an IV of Lemaire.

1790
02:19:07,308 --> 02:19:08,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1791
02:19:08,949 --> 02:19:09,750
[SPEAKER_10]: 15 points out.

1792
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:11,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Trent Reznor is pushing 60.

1793
02:19:11,971 --> 02:19:13,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And Robert Smith is.

1794
02:19:13,452 --> 02:19:15,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.

1795
02:19:15,233 --> 02:19:17,154
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

1796
02:19:17,154 --> 02:19:18,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, YYR.

1797
02:19:18,595 --> 02:19:22,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for, you know, obviously we talked a little bit about the indie games.

1798
02:19:22,938 --> 02:19:25,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Meshere is an immortal, not a Highlander.

1799
02:19:25,019 --> 02:19:26,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Highlanders are from Scotland.

1800
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:31,944
[SPEAKER_10]: No announcement needed, YYR.

1801
02:19:31,944 --> 02:19:37,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're working very hard and juggling all the facets of your life, and I can't wait for the super multitasking update.

1802
02:19:37,487 --> 02:19:43,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, thank you for your support and making OLR dreams literally, literally making them a reality.

1803
02:19:43,311 --> 02:19:45,232
[SPEAKER_10]: We owe you an awful lot of thanks for that.

1804
02:19:45,232 --> 02:19:49,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're so excited when we see the success that your games have.

1805
02:19:49,595 --> 02:19:54,918
[SPEAKER_10]: They ought to be bigger, quite frankly, but we enjoy seeing the success that is out there.

1806
02:19:56,542 --> 02:19:59,003
[SPEAKER_10]: S2100 Matt says I'm going to see Pink in October.

1807
02:19:59,003 --> 02:20:02,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Pink is still in her 40s, probably about our age, probably in her 40s.

1808
02:20:02,565 --> 02:20:06,146
[SPEAKER_10]: With Sheryl Crow, I think Sheryl Crow is about around 60 and guess.

1809
02:20:06,146 --> 02:20:08,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, some good stuff out there.

1810
02:20:09,315 --> 02:20:11,016
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we have another email.

1811
02:20:11,016 --> 02:20:11,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1812
02:20:11,737 --> 02:20:12,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1813
02:20:12,738 --> 02:20:14,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, actually, another one popped in.

1814
02:20:14,139 --> 02:20:15,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I just saw the inbox pop.

1815
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:20,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dear OLR, I want to give you a big congrats on reaching a thousand episodes.

1816
02:20:20,924 --> 02:20:26,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember listening back when jokes were made about making it this long, and I had no doubt y'all would have no doubt.

1817
02:20:27,629 --> 02:20:38,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Even back during the seventh anniversary when you played Anniversary from Para Para Paradise while listening to congratulatory voicemails, I felt like this was such a special podcast that I never wanted to end.

1818
02:20:38,661 --> 02:20:41,664
[SPEAKER_07]: But also I was just jamming hard to that song.

1819
02:20:41,664 --> 02:20:44,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I should have done that again.

1820
02:20:44,947 --> 02:20:48,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, maybe for the birthday, for the birthday.

1821
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:48,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1822
02:20:49,338 --> 02:20:53,282
[SPEAKER_07]: This show has been such a comfort and constant for me throughout my life.

1823
02:20:53,282 --> 02:20:57,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to honestly thank Jamie, Loki, and Rob for the time you've put into this.

1824
02:20:57,286 --> 02:21:01,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be here to celebrate when Orange Lounge Radio hits 2,000 episodes as well.

1825
02:21:01,650 --> 02:21:05,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Glad you'll be alive.

1826
02:21:05,073 --> 02:21:09,578
[SPEAKER_07]: A question I have is, do you plan on having any special guest interviews in the near future?

1827
02:21:09,578 --> 02:21:11,980
[SPEAKER_07]: The Kyle Ward episode comes to mind.

1828
02:21:11,980 --> 02:21:12,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, and I love y'all.

1829
02:21:12,921 --> 02:21:13,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Garth Wolf.

1830
02:21:14,346 --> 02:21:32,191
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great question and something we haven't really pursued in the COVID or post COVID, whatever you want to call it, the COVID era of our show, you know, where we are virtual now and, you know, we don't really have a studio at this point anymore, which was fine because when we did interviews before, we always did them over Skype or something else.

1831
02:21:32,191 --> 02:21:39,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of was like, well, this format, you know, I wasn't sure how well it would lend itself to guests, but I think we really should be open to that.

1832
02:21:39,813 --> 02:21:41,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to have guests on this show.

1833
02:21:42,774 --> 02:21:42,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Share!

1834
02:22:00,339 --> 02:22:02,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think she'd return our calls, to be quite honest.

1835
02:22:02,919 --> 02:22:04,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Realistically, who would you want?

1836
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:07,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a lot of people in chat are calling out Kyle Ward.

1837
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:07,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1838
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:09,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a great interview, obviously.

1839
02:22:09,601 --> 02:22:10,821
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a while ago.

1840
02:22:10,821 --> 02:22:11,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love.

1841
02:22:11,221 --> 02:22:12,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd love to.

1842
02:22:12,441 --> 02:22:15,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Diddy Archaholic made a good point, too.

1843
02:22:15,162 --> 02:22:22,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Stevie Nicks a few months ago still sings exactly as she did in her 20s, and she is in her 70s now.

1844
02:22:22,643 --> 02:22:26,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I'm myself, 54 and still playing music games.

1845
02:22:26,003 --> 02:22:27,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone want to challenge me in Beat Saber?

1846
02:22:27,964 --> 02:22:28,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty good for 54.

1847
02:22:30,424 --> 02:22:30,885
[SPEAKER_07]: and Stevie Nicks.

1848
02:22:45,353 --> 02:22:46,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yes to guests.

1849
02:22:46,855 --> 02:22:52,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, to be fair, we had a guest host here a few weeks ago.

1850
02:22:52,581 --> 02:22:59,108
[SPEAKER_10]: So why, why couldn't we go we had Rama fill in when Loki was out, we we can have a guest.

1851
02:22:59,108 --> 02:23:04,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just a matter of, it can be hard to get people to be here at this very specific time.

1852
02:23:05,735 --> 02:23:26,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa tell Greg to come back So yeah, I mean if there if there's something to promote, but I will say this 100% I'm drawing a line to this no Kickstarters, no Kickstarters or anything like it unless I'm willing to maybe consider but certainly not guaranteeing if the product is already finished and

1853
02:23:27,213 --> 02:23:29,956
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Kickstarter is publishing costs.

1854
02:23:29,956 --> 02:23:39,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I may be going to consider it, but I will never have another Kickstarter campaign on this show that isn't like a shippable product already.

1855
02:23:39,786 --> 02:23:41,648
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all.

1856
02:23:41,648 --> 02:23:41,888
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1857
02:23:43,907 --> 02:23:46,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, there's one more.

1858
02:23:46,068 --> 02:23:46,368
[SPEAKER_10]: One more.

1859
02:23:46,368 --> 02:23:48,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we got we got a yeah, just someone in chat.

1860
02:23:48,810 --> 02:23:49,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So they just yeah.

1861
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:50,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

1862
02:23:50,811 --> 02:23:58,056
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, it popped up while I was about to read Garth Wolf's Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi.

1863
02:23:58,056 --> 02:23:59,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Mishi.

1864
02:23:59,777 --> 02:24:00,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Short and sweet email.

1865
02:24:00,857 --> 02:24:03,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say congrats on your thousandth show.

1866
02:24:03,559 --> 02:24:04,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep them coming.

1867
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:06,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Sincerely, Mishikens.

1868
02:24:07,850 --> 02:24:09,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take it.

1869
02:24:09,391 --> 02:24:12,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take it short, short and sweet like a fortune cookie.

1870
02:24:12,632 --> 02:24:13,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I am perfect.

1871
02:24:13,812 --> 02:24:14,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1872
02:24:14,232 --> 02:24:18,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a fortune cookie now though.

1873
02:24:18,834 --> 02:24:19,774
[SPEAKER_10]: You're fucked.

1874
02:24:19,774 --> 02:24:22,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we don't have a fortune cookie message anymore.

1875
02:24:22,555 --> 02:24:24,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that used to be a thing on this show.

1876
02:24:24,255 --> 02:24:25,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it?

1877
02:24:25,656 --> 02:24:27,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was an after the credits thing.

1878
02:24:27,697 --> 02:24:29,877
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't stay for after the credits anymore.

1879
02:24:29,877 --> 02:24:34,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I got Debbie's to play Twitch streaming to do.

1880
02:24:34,779 --> 02:24:35,079
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1881
02:24:35,618 --> 02:24:37,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I also need another soda.

1882
02:24:37,339 --> 02:24:41,321
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I am going to open up the green room over at our Discord server.

1883
02:24:41,321 --> 02:24:47,404
[SPEAKER_10]: VOGnetwork.com slash Discord is the place if you want to join us.

1884
02:24:47,404 --> 02:24:54,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And while we wait to see if anyone wants to call, I am going to check in with Loki for last minute stories.

1885
02:24:54,728 --> 02:24:56,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, there's one.

1886
02:24:56,709 --> 02:24:59,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a cute little story about game designer Aaron.

1887
02:25:01,906 --> 02:25:11,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Piccaroon, who apparently proposed to his fiancée via a playdate game that he made.

1888
02:25:11,189 --> 02:25:12,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of cute.

1889
02:25:12,449 --> 02:25:17,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, it was a game that, you know, it was a platformer game.

1890
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would get these different letters.

1891
02:25:19,791 --> 02:25:21,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's called Love Letter.

1892
02:25:21,591 --> 02:25:25,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you get these different letters and each one would put a letter up on the board.

1893
02:25:25,773 --> 02:25:29,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it ended up with, you know, will you marry me at the end?

1894
02:25:29,874 --> 02:25:30,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1895
02:25:30,987 --> 02:25:31,687
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty cute.

1896
02:25:31,687 --> 02:25:34,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, she said yes.

1897
02:25:34,729 --> 02:25:37,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I still kind of want to get a playdate.

1898
02:25:37,050 --> 02:25:38,811
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks so cute.

1899
02:25:38,811 --> 02:25:40,911
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we have some calls waiting in the green room.

1900
02:25:40,911 --> 02:25:42,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to it again.

1901
02:25:42,032 --> 02:25:48,335
[SPEAKER_10]: VOGnetwork.com slash discord if you want to give us a call, but we will get to our first call tonight.

1902
02:25:48,335 --> 02:25:48,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1903
02:25:48,675 --> 02:25:49,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1904
02:25:49,255 --> 02:25:50,316
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on Orange Zones Radio.

1905
02:25:50,316 --> 02:25:50,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1906
02:25:51,718 --> 02:25:54,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, everybody.

1907
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:58,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one and only DJ Ranma S. How is everybody doing tonight?

1908
02:25:58,461 --> 02:26:06,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel complete now, because if we went 1000 episodes and you did not fucking call in for the 1000th episode, I would be like, something is missing.

1909
02:26:06,025 --> 02:26:07,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Something is missing tonight.

1910
02:26:07,225 --> 02:26:08,366
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an absence.

1911
02:26:08,366 --> 02:26:11,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel I feel something is missing in the air.

1912
02:26:11,547 --> 02:26:13,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And now now you're here.

1913
02:26:13,928 --> 02:26:15,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, motherfucker, let me tell you.

1914
02:26:15,269 --> 02:26:16,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's I'm like.

1915
02:26:21,774 --> 02:26:22,196
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

1916
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:29,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, you know, despite the chaos of my life the last 72 hours.

1917
02:26:29,944 --> 02:26:32,086
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hang up on you because we have a cat.

1918
02:26:32,086 --> 02:26:34,748
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a Midna is making an appearance on the show now.

1919
02:26:34,748 --> 02:26:40,473
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the podcasters can't see her, but we have Midna is on the show and therefore DJ Ranma S has been bumped.

1920
02:26:40,473 --> 02:26:40,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

1921
02:26:40,913 --> 02:26:43,695
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

1922
02:26:43,695 --> 02:26:45,276
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1923
02:26:45,276 --> 02:26:51,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I've heard you've been going through a lot, Ranma, so I don't know what to offer other than thoughts and prayers.

1924
02:26:52,102 --> 02:26:53,825
[SPEAKER_10]: but please take them.

1925
02:26:53,825 --> 02:26:56,490
[SPEAKER_10]: But well, here's the thing.

1926
02:26:56,490 --> 02:27:02,121
[SPEAKER_10]: In the gay agenda, we have gotten rid of thoughts and prayers and replaced them with rainbows and sparkles.

1927
02:27:02,121 --> 02:27:04,365
[SPEAKER_10]: So enjoy some rainbows and sparkles and good luck.

1928
02:27:06,627 --> 02:27:08,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely all for that.

1929
02:27:08,209 --> 02:27:10,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is just going to work out the way it is.

1930
02:27:10,430 --> 02:27:13,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just me having to grind a little bit harder.

1931
02:27:13,453 --> 02:27:14,113
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1932
02:27:14,113 --> 02:27:14,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear.

1933
02:27:14,714 --> 02:27:15,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear.

1934
02:27:15,394 --> 02:27:17,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Get back on that pole.

1935
02:27:17,316 --> 02:27:17,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

1936
02:27:17,836 --> 02:27:18,817
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1937
02:27:18,817 --> 02:27:20,538
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1938
02:27:20,538 --> 02:27:23,040
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want to call in to talk about tonight?

1939
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:31,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want to talk about what's been what y'all discussed, but I want to say on behalf of Anime Jam Session,

1940
02:27:32,631 --> 02:27:37,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Ari Rockefeller, Mako Chan, Barry, Senna, everyone.

1941
02:27:37,173 --> 02:27:39,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 1000th.

1942
02:27:39,134 --> 02:27:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to see it.

1943
02:27:41,715 --> 02:27:42,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

1944
02:27:42,516 --> 02:27:43,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1945
02:27:43,656 --> 02:27:44,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1946
02:27:44,096 --> 02:27:51,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Now who from Anime Jam Session will be administering the 1000 spankings?

1947
02:27:51,059 --> 02:27:53,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1948
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:54,601
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a team effort.

1949
02:27:54,601 --> 02:27:55,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no.

1950
02:27:55,041 --> 02:27:58,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh oh.

1951
02:27:58,343 --> 02:27:58,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh oh.

1952
02:27:59,602 --> 02:28:00,843
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be me.

1953
02:28:00,843 --> 02:28:01,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, I was hoping it would be Patty.

1954
02:28:01,984 --> 02:28:03,585
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

1955
02:28:03,585 --> 02:28:07,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you ask nicely, she will, because she has a cat of nine tails.

1956
02:28:07,307 --> 02:28:08,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1957
02:28:08,188 --> 02:28:10,169
[SPEAKER_10]: She's more merciless than I am.

1958
02:28:10,169 --> 02:28:13,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Nine at a time, we'll get through it a lot faster.

1959
02:28:13,111 --> 02:28:15,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on.

1960
02:28:15,573 --> 02:28:16,874
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1961
02:28:16,874 --> 02:28:25,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to say right now that I... All of you new nasties.

1962
02:28:26,337 --> 02:28:30,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I was just hanging out with- I own neither of these things.

1963
02:28:30,859 --> 02:28:37,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it from the little teeny leather alley during Sacred Pride.

1964
02:28:37,861 --> 02:28:51,865
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact, I'll just say, I just came back from an outing with a bunch of dirty-minded people and there was somebody there selling these things, which I almost dropped money on, but other things have come up, but you know.

1965
02:28:54,171 --> 02:28:57,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have a yaoi paddle somewhere.

1966
02:28:57,374 --> 02:29:03,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, DarkSakura, I don't know if you knew, but somebody tried to bring them back.

1967
02:29:03,458 --> 02:29:04,980
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1968
02:29:04,980 --> 02:29:11,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened was there was a cease and desist from the original creator saying, no, we're not bringing them back.

1969
02:29:11,465 --> 02:29:16,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why he created one for Kickstarter, because he never had an opportunity to get one.

1970
02:29:16,568 --> 02:29:20,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So he decided to crowdfund one.

1971
02:29:20,131 --> 02:29:22,193
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, I've had mine from like 2000.

1972
02:29:25,051 --> 02:29:32,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say there's a reason why you can't find yaoi paddles at conventions anymore.

1973
02:29:32,694 --> 02:29:33,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, boy.

1974
02:29:33,295 --> 02:29:34,735
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1975
02:29:34,735 --> 02:29:47,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't mean for this call to devolve into yaoi chat, but thank you very much to the cast and crew from Anime Jam Session, which I mean, you guys are no, you know, new, freshly bloomed podcast on the block yourselves.

1976
02:29:47,541 --> 02:29:54,404
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been doing this quite some time, and that's a success you all should take delight in over at Anime Jam Session.

1977
02:29:55,151 --> 02:30:21,420
[SPEAKER_01]: and we do and you know I get up and I do this I have a science down to it and I love it I enjoy it when I go to conventions and I hand out cards I hear from you oh I listen to you guys I watch you it makes me feel appreciated at least there's somebody that knows who we are and stuff like that and my inbox with cosplayers saying can I get a copy of my photos and I said oh thank you so

1978
02:30:22,697 --> 02:30:27,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, it just makes me, I feel like I've done my part coming in.

1979
02:30:27,329 --> 02:30:29,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just paying it forward.

1980
02:30:29,494 --> 02:30:31,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Let everyone have their time, you know?

1981
02:30:32,327 --> 02:30:33,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Love it.

1982
02:30:33,428 --> 02:30:36,511
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Rama, we're gonna let you go so we can make sure we get people.

1983
02:30:36,511 --> 02:30:37,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nope.

1984
02:30:37,431 --> 02:30:38,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1985
02:30:38,392 --> 02:30:39,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how?

1986
02:30:39,353 --> 02:30:41,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I am so I'm so sorry.

1987
02:30:41,194 --> 02:30:41,955
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1988
02:30:41,955 --> 02:30:42,375
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1989
02:30:42,375 --> 02:30:43,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaving.

1990
02:30:43,296 --> 02:30:43,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaving.

1991
02:30:43,696 --> 02:30:46,979
[SPEAKER_10]: How could I possibly fucking Nope, you can't see me.

1992
02:30:46,979 --> 02:30:47,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gone.

1993
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:51,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Because how could I fucking leave out the toast?

1994
02:30:51,643 --> 02:30:53,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I am my apologies.

1995
02:30:53,304 --> 02:30:55,246
[SPEAKER_10]: 1000 apologies for 1000 episodes Rama.

1996
02:30:56,747 --> 02:30:58,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have time to make myself a gin and tonic.

1997
02:30:58,829 --> 02:30:59,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1998
02:30:59,330 --> 02:31:01,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, I just got brought from the husband.

1999
02:31:01,352 --> 02:31:02,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, husband.

2000
02:31:02,233 --> 02:31:05,276
[SPEAKER_10]: A coffee because I made puppy dog eyes.

2001
02:31:05,276 --> 02:31:06,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm ready to.

2002
02:31:06,997 --> 02:31:10,441
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no Bailey's in this, but I will still partake in the toast.

2003
02:31:10,441 --> 02:31:11,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Rama, please.

2004
02:31:11,949 --> 02:31:13,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get some special water.

2005
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:17,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, listeners, listeners, get your shit together.

2006
02:31:17,053 --> 02:31:21,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Listeners, get your, it does not have to be an alcoholic beverage unless you want it to be.

2007
02:31:21,236 --> 02:31:21,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be.

2008
02:31:21,836 --> 02:31:23,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Just get, get the nearest beverage.

2009
02:31:23,417 --> 02:31:24,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Hydrate, you stupid bitch.

2010
02:31:24,978 --> 02:31:26,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Get something nearby.

2011
02:31:26,359 --> 02:31:27,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrate or didrate.

2012
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:29,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple as that.

2013
02:31:29,982 --> 02:31:31,783
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your reminder to hydrate.

2014
02:31:31,783 --> 02:31:32,083
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2015
02:31:32,083 --> 02:31:35,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Hydrate along with Rama.

2016
02:31:35,165 --> 02:31:35,886

[SPEAKER_01]: to 1,000 episodes of Orange Challenge Radio, to Rob, to Jamie, to Matt.

02:31:45,048 --> 02:31:49,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends and podcasters we'll ever be.

2019
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:57,714
[SPEAKER_01]: If we should ever happen to disagree, well then, fuck you, and here's to me.

2020
02:31:57,714 --> 02:31:59,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one too.

2021
02:31:59,194 --> 02:32:01,556
[SPEAKER_09]: A classic.

2022
02:32:01,556 --> 02:32:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's Like Us?

2023
02:32:03,516 --> 02:32:05,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn few.

2024
02:32:05,738 --> 02:32:06,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've all been canceled.

2025
02:32:09,448 --> 02:32:16,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Which reminds me, Jamie, you should watch the... there's a surprise on the end credits that you might like.

2026
02:32:16,393 --> 02:32:18,335
[SPEAKER_07]: End credits?

2027
02:32:19,159 --> 02:32:19,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

2028
02:32:19,979 --> 02:32:22,520
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something there that I kind of snuck in.

2029
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:25,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you leave early, but I kind of threw something in there.

2030
02:32:25,622 --> 02:32:28,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma decided to give us a little treat for a thousandth episode.

2031
02:32:28,843 --> 02:32:30,324
[SPEAKER_10]: So stay tuned.

2032
02:32:30,324 --> 02:32:32,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, let's see my toast.

2033
02:32:32,484 --> 02:32:39,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to, I'm going to toast a pop tart, a bagel, a crumpet, a tortilla, a pop tart, a toast.

2034
02:32:39,447 --> 02:32:40,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2035
02:32:40,548 --> 02:32:41,808
[SPEAKER_10]: To absent friends.

2036
02:32:41,808 --> 02:32:48,531
[SPEAKER_10]: No, um, to the haters, to all of you out there who posted on the internet,

2037
02:32:49,670 --> 02:33:10,622
[SPEAKER_10]: that this show was never gonna get as far as it did, that this show was so bad we had no right being on the internet, that this show was, uh, that, that we were so ill-informed on the industry we would never get past a certain episode that we don't know what the fuck we're ever talking about to all of the haters out there.

2038
02:33:10,622 --> 02:33:12,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I drink your tears.

2039
02:33:12,783 --> 02:33:14,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And aren't they delicious?

2040
02:33:15,595 --> 02:33:17,316
[SPEAKER_09]: A little salty.

2041
02:33:17,316 --> 02:33:26,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that spite that's motivated us for 1,000 episodes.

2042
02:33:26,124 --> 02:33:30,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Your tears of stupidity are delicious.

2043
02:33:30,247 --> 02:33:32,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have another drink.

2044
02:33:32,969 --> 02:33:33,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a shame.

2045
02:33:33,610 --> 02:33:37,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I was drinking out of my salty survivor tears.

2046
02:33:37,653 --> 02:33:41,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make a sequel to that for us.

2047
02:33:41,336 --> 02:33:42,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, that just leaves you.

2048
02:33:42,337 --> 02:33:43,038
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to do a toast?

2049
02:33:44,133 --> 02:33:46,574
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know the toast.

2050
02:33:46,574 --> 02:33:47,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2051
02:33:47,295 --> 02:33:48,876
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2052
02:33:48,876 --> 02:33:50,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm gonna let you go.

2053
02:33:50,056 --> 02:33:50,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

2054
02:33:50,877 --> 02:33:52,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you, friend.

2055
02:33:52,558 --> 02:33:55,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And until next time.

[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2057
02:33:56,020 --> 02:33:58,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care of yourselves and each other.

2058

02:33:59,021 --> 02:34:01,843
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2060
02:34:01,843 --> 02:34:05,465
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's bring in somebody else.

2071
02:34:25,263 --> 02:34:27,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why my camera is not coming through.

2072
02:34:27,004 --> 02:34:28,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent it up but oh well.

2073
02:34:28,866 --> 02:34:29,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, welcome.

2074
02:34:29,787 --> 02:34:33,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the lovely world of fucking discord problems.

02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:36,472
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

2077
02:34:36,472 --> 02:34:37,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the button.

2078
02:34:37,834 --> 02:34:38,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

2079
02:34:50,042 --> 02:34:52,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is this so funny?

2080
02:34:52,284 --> 02:34:56,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops, here's the button.

2081
02:34:56,247 --> 02:34:58,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's so funny.

2082
02:34:58,109 --> 02:35:00,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Brad, you're the one that always gives us shit.

2083
02:35:00,811 --> 02:35:03,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever one of us goes, we're old, I'm old.

2084
02:35:03,793 --> 02:35:07,317
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the first one to pop up and say shut the fuck up.

2085
02:35:07,317 --> 02:35:09,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, right.

2086
02:35:09,338 --> 02:35:09,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And

2087
02:35:10,526 --> 02:35:16,291
[SPEAKER_10]: podculture, I'm sorry, but you just you just exacerbated old man right there.

2088
02:35:16,291 --> 02:35:21,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's the button.

2089
02:35:21,315 --> 02:35:22,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I am old.

2090
02:35:22,897 --> 02:35:23,617
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's great.

[SPEAKER_02]: So now I just want to say congrats on 1000 episodes and

2094
02:35:32,096 --> 02:35:45,014
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I made a point in chat earlier, it's you guys have birth episodes, birth shows, and y'all were a huge influence on our show.

2095
02:35:45,014 --> 02:35:46,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't even make it half that long.

2096
02:35:47,898 --> 02:36:13,714
[SPEAKER_10]: but you but you know what you did you had a damn impressive run a damn impressive run so you know and you know I always I know sometimes you like to tease maybe maybe I'm gonna get the band back together someday if ABBA could do a new album after like 40 fucking years maybe just maybe we'll have to talk off camera because it will have to be something like what you've done post post pandemic

2097
02:36:14,096 --> 02:36:14,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm hmm.

2098
02:36:14,977 --> 02:36:17,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Discord does make it possible.

2099
02:36:17,718 --> 02:36:20,999
[SPEAKER_10]: But you do have to use the button.

2100
02:36:20,999 --> 02:36:26,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get used to using the damn button.

2101
02:36:26,042 --> 02:36:27,643
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, practice makes perfect.

2102
02:36:27,643 --> 02:36:29,804
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Brad, any other thoughts for us tonight?

02:36:46,721 --> 02:36:48,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew people wanted to call in tonight?

2117
02:36:48,542 --> 02:36:49,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

2118
02:36:49,122 --> 02:36:49,682
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great.

02:36:49,682 --> 02:36:50,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

02:36:52,784 --> 02:36:54,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2123
02:36:54,384 --> 02:36:56,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

2127
02:37:02,968 --> 02:37:06,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, to whatever do we owe this phone call tonight?

2128
02:37:06,210 --> 02:37:06,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, look.

2129
02:37:09,631 --> 02:37:12,472
[SPEAKER_10]: You found the button!

2130
02:37:12,472 --> 02:37:14,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are the wrong cameras showing up?

2131
02:37:14,553 --> 02:37:16,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, I don't know.

2132
02:37:16,333 --> 02:37:17,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of reasons.

2133
02:37:17,673 --> 02:37:18,433
[SPEAKER_10]: What's wrong?

2134
02:37:18,433 --> 02:37:18,713
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2135
02:37:18,713 --> 02:37:22,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I think I have to reorder people here for it to work.

2136
02:37:22,954 --> 02:37:23,795
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2137
02:37:23,795 --> 02:37:24,595
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll figure that out.

2138
02:37:24,595 --> 02:37:28,176
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, what what is on your mind, my friend?

2139
02:37:28,176 --> 02:37:34,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, like I like like everybody else, I'm coming to give you guys your flowers for for just a wonderful

2140
02:37:35,242 --> 02:37:37,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Milestone of hitting a thousand episodes.

2141
02:37:37,923 --> 02:37:43,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Does giving us our flowers involve singing the Miss America theme song while we walk the stage?

2142
02:37:43,284 --> 02:37:44,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, I am.

2143
02:37:44,304 --> 02:37:45,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no performer.

2144
02:37:45,225 --> 02:37:46,745
[SPEAKER_00]: You that's that's all.

2145
02:37:46,745 --> 02:37:48,185
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you.

2146
02:37:48,185 --> 02:37:57,288
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I am no performer, but no, just the show, you know, it's just been.

2147
02:37:57,288 --> 02:38:02,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So special to all of us, all of us listeners that, you know, like and I think like some of the

2148
02:38:03,328 --> 02:38:09,989
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about the show is that, you know, the community that we've kind of fostered over the these many, many years.

2149
02:38:09,989 --> 02:38:14,430
[SPEAKER_00]: And just want to thank you all for that, for that.

2150
02:38:14,430 --> 02:38:17,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And just all the.

2151
02:38:17,091 --> 02:38:22,812
[SPEAKER_00]: All the just all the great vibes you've kind of given us over the years and.

2152
02:38:22,812 --> 02:38:26,533

2153
02:38:28,093 --> 02:38:29,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing this shirt.

2154
02:38:29,974 --> 02:38:36,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, for the podcast folks, it is an original, an OG DDR Freak t-shirt from DDR Freak.

2155
02:38:36,956 --> 02:38:39,857
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of these secondary DDR Freak shirts.

2156
02:38:39,857 --> 02:38:40,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Still.

2157
02:38:40,997 --> 02:38:41,678
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably right.

2158
02:38:41,678 --> 02:38:41,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2159
02:38:41,818 --> 02:38:45,379
[SPEAKER_07]: The old one was the person on the dance pad silhouette.

2160
02:38:45,379 --> 02:38:50,681
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, but still the fact that it hasn't broken up after being washed is after all this time is impressive as fuck.

2161
02:38:50,681 --> 02:38:51,341
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

2162
02:38:51,341 --> 02:38:53,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even have one of those anymore.

2205
02:42:02,618 --> 02:42:06,001
[SPEAKER_10]: vognetwork.com slash discord is the place to go.

2206
02:42:06,001 --> 02:42:08,763
[SPEAKER_10]: With that, let me also just check in one more time.

2207
02:42:08,763 --> 02:42:11,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other last minute stories we didn't get to yet?

2208
02:42:11,145 --> 02:42:13,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

2209
02:42:13,366 --> 02:42:13,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Welp.

2210
02:42:14,451 --> 02:42:20,354
[SPEAKER_10]: then with that, I think we close up our 1000th episode.

2211
02:42:20,354 --> 02:42:21,935
[SPEAKER_10]: But can you believe it?

2212
02:42:21,935 --> 02:42:25,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I I kind of it's weird.

2213
02:42:25,297 --> 02:42:26,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I can and I can't.

2214
02:42:26,898 --> 02:42:32,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's one of those things where it's like it's just like I don't remember the other 999 episodes.

2215
02:42:32,661 --> 02:42:36,203
[SPEAKER_10]: So it feels so surreal in some ways.

2216
02:42:36,203 --> 02:42:37,924
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, it's also like

2217
02:42:38,993 --> 02:42:49,500
[SPEAKER_10]: this show and this community and everything has been here like so long that I do, I'm like, okay, yeah, this is like, this is that we made it to that checkpoint.

2218
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:52,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess to use a gaming reference, we made it to that checkpoint.

2219
02:42:52,482 --> 02:42:54,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we're on to the next lap, you know, and

2220
02:42:56,564 --> 02:43:12,573
[SPEAKER_10]: The race is not going to go on forever and I think we need to accept and understand that, but we can use this opportunity for a thousand episodes to kind of go, damn, this has really been an incredible run and it's really because of

2221
02:43:13,733 --> 02:43:14,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:43:31,563 --> 02:43:33,083

2228
02:44:33,084 --> 02:44:34,345
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Y2K.

2229
02:44:34,345 --> 02:44:35,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Some things are going to malfunction.

2230
02:44:35,966 --> 02:44:43,351
[SPEAKER_10]: The Y2K virus has made the odometer in my brain malfunction and I'm combining words, melting down.

[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to final thoughts.
