40888	43469	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
43509	48310	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48450	50871	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
51371	60553	We are live back once again on the 1st of December, 2024, episode number 1027 of our show.
61033	65394	Me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66475	66695	Hi.
67015	67775	Hello, how are you?
70978	78682	I have a lot to do at work that I have to get done in two weeks.
79282	84425	So it's going to be balls to the wall, as they say, whoever they are.
86006	91269	But I had all these plans of stuff I needed to get done during the week I was off.
93350	94251	That's how it goes.
96462	97143	I hear that.
99425	104428	Unfortunately, my husband, Alan, has been very sick this weekend, and it's nothing that I caught.
105289	109432	Didn't come up on a COVID test, so don't know what he's battling right now.
110152	112474	That was how it was for me and Dan.
112614	114075	Yeah, it's weird.
114576	116357	He is doing the Mucinex thing, though.
118158	146726	but uh he's uh you know just unfortunately he's been out of it so didn't get to take a trip to Ikea I was thinking it might be a good thing to do because I actually I want to replace some of the stuff I have behind me here I now have a second little mini arcade machine it's a new one that just showed up well actually y'all might remember this I I asked for this for my birthday from the birthday fairy uh which is an odd name for my husband but sure we'll go with that the birthday fairy um he actually pre-ordered or pre-purchased
146986	151610	I need to go to Ikea I need to look for a couple of smaller storage shelves because I am in the middle of redoing my office
172069	172570	Oh, there you go.
172590	173010	Officially.
173150	173750	Yeah, there you go.
173790	177794	So that's kind of where I'm at is that I just, if I could, I have a little bit of room.
177834	184979	It's hard to see on the camera, but I have a little bit of space between my arcade one-up machines and there's a little space with the wall over here.
184999	196748	So if I kind of move them a little closer together, I think I'll have just enough room with the couch here to fit a kind of a better, a more stable countertop for two arcade top machines, which will be nice.
197188	197328	So.
198069	223523	because after that I'm out of room no more because we keep joking keeps joking like oh there's a full-size Mortal Kombat machine that's a hundred dollars off oh there's a Pac-Man it's literally that where will we put it we are out of room hey that's where we are like we need a bigger house Dan's like I have to reorganize my office so I can fit Metallica in there right now Metallica's in the middle of our hallway wow the whole band yeah
224082	227485	Yeah, you know, they all fit in my hallway.
227585	227945	I'm kidding.
228606	230488	I mean, standing up, they could probably fit in my hallway.
231849	234611	But anyway, yeah, the machine is there in the hallway.
235432	242878	And then I've got, because I've been going through just pockets of stuff, like, because I knew I was going to be going through this room, I sort of just threw stuff around.
244560	248263	And so I've got pockets of sorting bins that I've bought at Daiso.
249562	254346	that I'm just using to break down what goes in what room, what's an art supply.
254386	260631	That's my biggest thing is all my hordes of art supplies, which I will probably be putting together care packages.
261131	261352	Nice.
262052	268317	By the way, by the way, Rob, did you know that you are going to be the recipient of one of my donor cards?
268637	271900	I heard from donating during your subathon.
272140	278225	I was able to get in there early, early, but then I had to run to the drugstore for Alan, and then I was going off to the Bay Area for Friday.
279406	295529	I have a collection of semi-rude cards semi-rude like my favorite one is the one that says thank you for the gift that shows how little you know me you know they're just snarky I thought they were fun so excited
296536	299378	Alright, well, let's see what kind of snark he has for the holidays.
299438	300379	It's Techmaster Loki.
300439	300999	How are you, Loki?
301240	302220	Hello, I'm good.
302961	307564	Any home improvement projects on your end, since we're talking about trying to rearrange things to make space?
308265	308885	What about you?
308925	311747	You're approaching, is this the last day of your two-week break?
312688	313309	Yeah.
313329	314289	Oh, I'm sorry, Loki.
314589	315710	Rest in peace to your break.
316371	317912	Did you have a decent one overall?
319048	319689	It was okay.
319709	321292	I got stuff done.
321852	325118	Well, best of all, you got to take a break from your day job.
326159	327081	So, that's nice.
328142	328363	Yeah.
328908	334269	I've had like the last... I took most of last week off, so I've had like six days off in a row or something like that.
334729	335349	It's been nice.
335369	337130	The only bummer is with Alan's sick.
337170	338310	It's kind of really limited.
339290	345372	Thanksgiving for me was... I basically had to leave Alan here, and I went out and took my dad out.
345752	348532	So it was just me and my dad for Thanksgiving, which is fine.
348792	349913	I'm glad I got to see my dad.
350853	354934	And then we had to leave Alan at home for a little Friendsgiving I did yesterday.
355054	355654	So it's like...
357175	359378	I feel really bad for him.
359398	362582	This is a shitty time of year to be sick, but what can you do?
363663	363843	Yeah.
363983	364544	What can you do?
365365	368389	But hopefully you're feeling good, Loki, even if you do have to go back to work tomorrow.
369969	373871	Yeah, as good as you can on a Sunday night when you know you have work tomorrow.
373891	374391	That's right.
374591	375032	That's right.
375532	387718	Well, we'll make the best of this Sunday night by talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all of you in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
387738	388639	That's V-O-G Network.
389319	393101	9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
394022	395803	And that's where you can find us each and every week.
396063	398244	And we are, of course, watching chat.
398704	400785	Some people talking about Ikea brands in there.
401186	407949	Tiger Claw also mentioning, I go back to work tomorrow, but work closes for the holidays from December 20th to January 6th.
407989	413392	Yeah, I used to work for a company like that that took the entire two weeks off like it was winter break from school.
413773	417595	My current company doesn't really do that, but I'm okay kind of where I...
418075	418916	All is well, all is well.
441078	441658	All right, Rogi, Loki.
459966	460686	Yep.
460866	469549	Yeah, so we've got a brand new patent that's been filed by Nintendo for what is assumed to be the next game console that they have.
470809	479451	So what this is, is basically a tech patent that allows their console to work seamlessly with mobile phones.
480151	485833	Now, the actual patent itself talks about, I believe, additional displays.
486775	501778	So it's saying that basically the game console itself will determine a second image that includes the connection destination information and be displayed on a secondary display device.
502138	509199	So essentially using phones as kind of like an additional screen or something like that.
510620	511580	So that could be cool.
512270	519077	Yes, but it's also definitely not the first time we've seen the phone as a, you know, secondary device.
519397	533591	Well, just any, any, I mean, that and just anything as a secondary device on a Nintendo console, because we used to do that a lot with like the, I don't know if the DS had, I guess the DS did have some of that connectivity, but I know the Game Boy Advance for sure had that.
534832	557340	with like the GameCube and stuff like that so it's not the first time we've seen something like this it makes sense that you would see like another like a phone as a possibly a you know input device on even like some things like I can see like integration with like a Jackbox game or something like that I mean I technically do that now but that's the game I think of is that Jackbox games yeah
557580	558200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
578393	579814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
596980	599462	But wasn't that supposed to be a thing with the Amico?
599943	610873	Like the whole fact that you could use your mobile phone as a controller In fact, I believe what they actually put out Remember the whole Amico app?
611594	615918	Whatever they actually put out was that silly app that had some of the games in it
616798	621162	You could tell the app was just going to be the OS for the Amico system at some point.
621482	623003	Because you needed two phones, right?
623023	627466	You needed one to service the Intellivision, and then the other to be your controller.
627906	630328	So the Intellivision was supposed to use this as well.
630448	632790	So for as much shit as we give Amico...
633450	640231	Here's Nintendo doing something similar, although, to be fair, I would say Jackbox was the first place I really remember seeing it.
640271	644412	I'm not saying it was the first to ever do it, but it was the first place I really remember seeing it was the Jackbox part.
644432	657515	Yeah, I wouldn't give much credit or any credit to the Amico, to be honest, because, like, I mean, with that, they were like, well, the controller is integral to be able to play these games, and then they're like, but, you know, you can just use a mobile phone to do that.
657835	658075	Yeah.
658095	660436	Like, okay, well, why do I need...
662645	665088	Why do I need a console for these mobile games?
665709	666590	Don't you all have phones?
667631	668032	We do.
668292	669493	We're playing on them.
669594	671756	But what's a console need to be here for?
671856	674900	It's like additional Android devices just in the way.
675020	675681	Like, I don't know.
676242	676382	Yeah.
677520	678260	They were smart.
678380	682862	They would have just had an app on like, you know, these smart TVs and there you go.
682882	683823	There's your Amico console.
684083	686184	You can download your console for free.
686384	689866	That is where you would think things may have ended up at the end of the day.
689966	691206	I mean, I don't know.
691566	692927	I've kind of just stopped caring.
693067	694268	I'm just going to be 100% honest.
694288	699570	I just stopped caring about it, especially after the sale of everything but the Amico to Atari.
700010	701471	It's kind of one of those things where you're like,
702290	730952	I don't know what's going to happen I am assuming at this point the Amico is full on vaporware that it's just not happening ever and I've come to accept that if one day one of them shows up at my house because yes I pre-ordered one call me what you want I don't care I'm already over it like you know it's then one shows up as a pleasant surprise but even at that I wouldn't expect much out of it at this point because that console is supposed to be out five years ago so yeah
732253	735694	Yeah, I don't think there'll be anything coming.
736114	739015	Yeah, Bobby says, to be fair, we only put a deposit on one.
739315	739915	Yeah, it's true.
739935	742536	Well, I'm sure they would happily charge my bank account for the rest of it.
743176	749617	But they're going to need to... Well, actually, the card that they would have is so old at this point.
749697	751298	Like, all those cards expired.
753345	757646	I have a totally different credit card, that totally different bank and everything from when I first pre-ordered.
757666	759247	So yeah, they'd have to find all that information.
759267	764248	So until they come asking me for my new credit card, I'm assuming it's never happening.
766949	770230	Anyway, look forward to my autobiography someday.
770270	771310	Tommy Tallarico owes me $100.
776127	776548	Does he?
778109	781493	Oh yeah, he has your pre-order.
782054	788140	This is why it's very few Kickstarters and very few of these pre-order things I'll ever do again.
788841	791284	I did the Electronic Gaming Monthly one.
792643	794964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
817239	818240	Yeah, there's one.
818260	819261	I was just checking, actually.
819361	824044	Funny, no, I was checking Kickstarter earlier in the week because I saw one of these games.
824064	825225	They were advertising an update.
825245	828748	I'm like, oh, did I ever get that from the Kickstarter?
828828	830549	Apparently, it was in my library still.
831470	832330	I had gotten that.
832350	834572	But there was one, though, that still...
836485	839826	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
867232	867972	I'm just helping.
868112	871394	That dollar goes to the VOG fund, not Rob's bank account.
871414	872014	But that's all right.
872054	872454	That's all right.
873554	876215	How much of Rob's bank account goes into the VOG fund anyway?
876515	879116	Do you think he's ever going to show us?
879196	880957	I mean, he's still doing video games live, right?
881997	882757	I don't think so.
883097	883418	I think.
883478	883698	No?
884178	884398	No.
884458	886499	He's just not going to disappear off the face of the earth?
886519	886899	Um.
888035	889376	Bobby says Tommy's a backgammon champion now
907011	907331	Really?
908152	909733	I didn't know that.
909874	913977	All those prize pools for backgammon, you know, that can pay off the Amico.
914378	917781	Hey, the old G4 guy at our old network is an ice cream guy now.
919322	921644	I know, I'm jealous that that's not nearby.
922045	923986	He actually has some nitrogen ice cream.
924006	925147	Sounds pretty good, to be honest.
925347	926028	Can't hate on that.
927910	928630	Wow, I had no idea.
928650	931333	Bobby says he won a world tournament in Monte Carlo.
932911	934592	I mean, good for him.
934612	938495	According to go to Monte Carlo for a tournament when he owes people all this money.
938655	939156	Wow.
939836	941758	I mean, honestly, like if he had just like
942628	947432	Skip the whole Amico section and did the backhand and stuff.
947492	949753	We might be thinking a little more favorably of him.
951414	954056	Here's the weird thing, and this is the last I'm going to say on it.
954897	963463	Because I know there's always a thousand haters every time you just say Tommy Tallarico three times in the mirror and the YouTube comments will get flooded with haters.
963603	967346	And I get it, and I understand why people... The man has a bit of an ego.
967486	967907	I get it.
968347	970509	But at the same time, I don't think...
971229	973071	He's not bad, he's just drawn that way
998451	1024977	a thief and an aloof foolishness not that I'm excusing it but I'm just saying I don't think he's a bad guy I just think he made a lot of bad decisions yeah I think when they got to like their second or third funding round that they probably should have questioned their intent at that point it's like okay yeah that was the point I knew I wasn't seeing my money again
1027978	1028659	It is what it is.
1029159	1029459	All right.
1030220	1037745	But now all the other fundraisers, or not fundraisers, but crowdfunding.
1038166	1049274	Now all the other crowdfunding efforts have to pay for it because I won't back one again unless I personally know the person or that there's an actual end product that we're looking at type of thing.
1049656	1060204	Yeah, I backed one recently in August for these marble run things through the company Rocker, which I've got my wooden pinball machine that I still haven't finished because I haven't worked on it.
1060644	1064266	But the marble kit's cool and they actually showed up, so that was kind of nice.
1064326	1065467	They're not all bad out there.
1065527	1068069	I mean, there are some, but it's not all bad projects.
1068389	1071892	You just have to do your research on if they're more established or something like that.
1071952	1077416	Or in the case of some of these indie games and stuff like that, you have to do a physical release or
1077956	1099959	you know something more specific you just have to look at the track record of the group although that said i mean like and even like the amico stuff with like who was like involved with it like it sounded like a good thing at the time but i didn't get it but i was like well at least they'll release a product it just won't be it'll be like an uya you know and not necessarily good but it'll be a product little do we know
1101513	1102373	No, no Mariah Carey ever.
1126861	1129147	Well, Whamageddon began today.
1129708	1132735	I would rather Whamageddon than the Mirai Apocalypse.
1133296	1133837	I agree.
1135952	1138334	And I brought it up yesterday.
1139034	1142997	I mean, yesterday was still November, though, so that we're still technically safe.
1143057	1147219	But like, I was like, listen, I might stop playing that song.
1147500	1156145	And instead, my wife decided to turn it up and then also teach us or convince our son to learn it on piano.
1156185	1157186	So yeah.
1160273	1162133	Oh my god, can your son actually play?
1162734	1164174	I don't have a lot for you.
1164234	1165054	Some of it, yeah.
1165214	1167195	Oh my god, that's so good.
1169235	1172416	Pretty soon your wife is just going to yell out, it's time!
1174537	1176117	I think she's signing that video too.
1176137	1177457	You know what?
1178338	1178818	You know what?
1180598	1187360	I'm just going to dig myself a hole in the backyard and stay there until December 25th and then bust out all my Hanukkah stuff.
1188180	1191761	And then I'm going to hire a Klezmer band to follow Oli all around.
1192261	1194441	Is this the same kid that's playing the recorder?
1195722	1197262	Because you got two kids, Loki.
1197402	1198262	One's on the piano.
1198622	1201363	Get the other one on the recorder to start playing.
1201383	1202623	No, he's not going to play the recorder.
1204764	1205704	I want to play the recorder.
1208345	1209225	I want a bass recorder.
1210382	1211962	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1232731	1235272	Anyway, I played stuff and I bought stuff.
1236012	1243876	It was a bad idea that I bought stuff because I'm actually trying to save up for some things, namely an OLED Steam Deck.
1244596	1253320	But I played, well, I had that subathon on Black Friday that only a few people really came for, but it was cool.
1253340	1253700	I had fun.
1254700	1267755	um I uh I played uh of course Dead by Daylight played a lot of it we had a whole session a whole round where we got to pet the puppy for the new killer he's a good doggo um
1269358	1286369	then played Polya, played Dragon Age The Veilguard Dan and one of his pinball buddies Jeff, he came over and they were playing The Legend of Zelda and Zelda 2 in the other room so that was going on in my house
1287669	1311963	um then uh I also I've been playing uh the Suica game and I got another game that had been on my list and it was really cheap so I got Fruit Mountain which is like the Suica game but in more 3D on like a plate you have to stack and match up the the food until it forms like the different fruits and whatnot
1312863	1314685	I also picked up Arcade Spirits.
1315425	1316946	I got Battle Chef Brigade.
1317527	1318627	I got Last Faith.
1319628	1321349	And I picked up Toho New World.
1322570	1327354	And also Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite Deluxe Edition because it's marked down to 11 bucks.
1328814	1352528	because uh it why not why not you know I just did it because of reasons um and yeah I uh I've just been doing my my own stuff um happy oh and um Hecht mentioned something about a team making a wrestling game that's worked off a reverse engineered N64 wrestling engine and yes I have seen this um
1353945	1361248	I actually had a beta of it downloaded at some point very recently, but I haven't played it.
1361768	1365629	But that was based off of WrestleMania 2K for N64.
1366150	1366990	So I do have that.
1367570	1372172	And I also have something that I will be talking about today for Classic Games.
1373462	1373702	Nice.
1375765	1377727	Rewinding a little bit to Dead by Daylight.
1378708	1382873	For those not aware, the new killer in Dead by Daylight is the Houndmaster, right?
1382913	1384555	She's glorious.
1384636	1387179	She's a pirate lady who has a dog.
1387199	1388100	The dog is the mechanic.
1388120	1389001	The dog will chase survivors.
1389021	1390142	Your dog's name is Snug.
1390603	1391444	It's about the dog.
1392525	1397309	Yeah, and Mori is literally step on me, mommy.
1398590	1405175	That's the part that cracks me up, is they actually turn step on me, mommy into a Mori, because you know what she does?
1405655	1410199	She steps on you, and it's actually kind of gross, but you don't see anything too gory.
1410259	1413141	Dead by Daylight is still kind of cartoon violence.
1413221	1414002	I've noticed something.
1414494	1415214	I was perfectly fine.
1415334	1416855	My Meg was protected by the power of the pig.
1431943	1433884	Well, I was going to ask what we think of the new killer.
1433904	1437087	Because I was watching... I haven't played yet, though.
1437247	1442070	See, I was watching Nick, our pal, Nick and Prince, who I'm sure you raid him a lot.
1442130	1443831	I know we talked about him before.
1443851	1445472	Because you and I both enjoy watching him.
1445512	1447073	And he plays a lot of killer in Dead by Daylight.
1448054	1450796	He was not enjoying his time with her.
1450896	1451697	Really?
1452057	1452257	Yeah.
1452517	1454979	I guess apparently the dog is really bugged.
1455359	1456920	And does not run.
1457160	1459202	You can see some clips on his channel where he's like...
1459682	1460622	Go here, dog!
1460662	1463904	And the dog suddenly teleports to another part of the map.
1463924	1465064	There's just some weird shit.
1465284	1465725	It's a cat.
1465845	1466505	Bad dog.
1466645	1467085	Bad dog.
1467105	1467885	Yeah, bad dog.
1468306	1471047	So he seemed to be getting really frustrated.
1471067	1473308	I did get the skin, though, so I could get the poodle.
1473628	1476289	And I swear, if you look at the poodle face on, it looks like the Wraith.
1476989	1477549	Interesting.
1477890	1482932	Like, the way that the poodle's floofy hair goes, it looks like the little pointy part on the Wraith's mask and everything.
1483232	1483412	Mm-hmm.
1484457	1485717	It's so weird.
1487718	1490258	The killer's design and everything I think is fine.
1490278	1491559	I don't think anybody has a problem with that.
1491599	1492179	She looks great.
1492199	1494699	And her voice acting.
1494819	1496380	Actually, I'm going to be honest.
1497880	1501041	Sometimes we've talked about things in video games that are hard to deal with.
1501141	1511023	Like DarkSakura, you've mentioned before you don't like clowns so you don't appreciate when we talk about the killer clowns game or even the clown is in Dead by Daylight and I'm sure you do not like seeing him show up.
1512524	1514044	I told you what I'd do to him.
1514747	1515768	Actually, I forget.
1515808	1516709	What do you do for clowns?
1516729	1519832	He wears the chicken mask, so I don't have to look at him if I have to play him.
1519892	1521954	Oh, when you play him, you're the one that dresses as chicken.
1521974	1522254	Yeah, yeah.
1522935	1523195	No, no.
1523275	1526158	I have him in a regular outfit, but I put the chicken mask on his head.
1526538	1526979	Oh, got it.
1527019	1527259	Okay.
1527579	1530882	And the last time I got my adept with him, it took me five minutes.
1531263	1531723	Less than that.
1531843	1532624	Less than five minutes.
1532764	1534105	I don't know if you remember.
1534686	1536227	And I don't know how many listeners know this.
1536708	1538630	I have issues with big dogs.
1539310	1542371	And this goes back to a childhood thing.
1543072	1547674	When I was five years old, I was bit by a dog and it was kind of like hysteria and all these things happened.
1547734	1562039	So I will just say the last time I had a full-on panic attack was because a big dog was off a leash, owner nowhere to be found, basically threatening me unprovoked.
1562059	1564400	It's not like I was trying to mess with this dog or anything.
1564440	1565301	So my point is...
1566381	1570545	I'm a little worried how I'm going to take to this whole thing, but I've been watching it.
1570606	1579615	I'm kind of like, all right, like I think because it is a video game and my brain can really kind of like separate the two and I realize it's not like a thing.
1580115	1582858	And plus that whole thing for me has actually gotten better over the years.
1583098	1585641	Like I used to, I used to not even do this.
1585681	1588443	When 1-2 was live, you were over here when Will was here and had 1-2.
1589204	1600949	Yeah, it's gotten better, but it's one of those things where the less I think about it, the less... But when I was watching Nick's stream, it sort of came to my mind where I was like, wait a minute, I don't like big dogs.
1602349	1607872	I don't like saying that because every dog owner wants to fight when I say that, so I hope people will understand the difference.
1608012	1610913	What I mean when I say I don't like big dogs really means...
1611613	1617419	My upbringing caused me to have this brain reaction when dogs do these things to me unprovoked.
1617699	1619641	That's what I mean when I say I don't like big dogs.
1620422	1626669	I'm sure your dog is a princess, but I'm just saying generally I have issues.
1626769	1630052	Just flat out do what I do about the snail and slug thing.
1630252	1631293	I've got trauma around that.
1632082	1634844	Yeah, and most people get it.
1636225	1638647	It's not that you don't like them.
1638687	1642209	They're probably nice and personable, but you have trauma around them.
1642449	1643510	Yes, all of that.
1645531	1650435	Honestly, small dogs even used to kind of bug me, but we're kind of past that point now.
1650555	1652816	I can tolerate small dogs pretty easy at this point.
1653137	1654738	In fact, some of them I think are rather cute.
1654878	1657800	My grandma used to have a Dachshund when she was with us who I thought was cute.
1658761	1659541	I love corgis.
1659841	1660722	I love corgis.
1661602	1688636	I got to play with a corgi corgis are basically fat fucking cats like they're divas and they have the cute butts and I'm honestly not allergic to them I just found out so dog fans I'll meet you halfway corgis but the big dogs can stay locked up in the thing over there and I'll appreciate it from a great distance please don't get any closer
1689400	1699763	This might just be me, but looking at the two dog models, though, for Snug, like the poodle and the... Oh, someone told me what it was.
1700063	1702743	I thought it was a mastiff, but it's another kind of dog.
1703584	1708965	But look at them, like, right in the face, and, like, the normal one looks...
1710529	1712851	I don't know, kind of looks like a good boy.
1713431	1714872	But the poodle looks evil.
1715653	1716333	Avoid the poodle.
1716553	1723058	Which tracks because my grandparents had poodles.
1723378	1724219	My other grandparents.
1724439	1728342	So my dad's mom had the Dasha and my mom's mom and dad had the poodles.
1729483	1731064	My uncle had an Afghan.
1732885	1733866	My uncle had an Afghan.
1735053	1743559	I just had to ask your opinions on the killer I still had a gaming week Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done See?
1743579	1754846	You know what they say about assuming Oh, the other thing is that I found my copy of Tetris 2 for Famicom That's it Oh, interesting, alright Loki, how was your gaming week?
1756498	1784072	um it was pretty much just working on Minecraft stuff so I was putting out content this week and then we're just working on the big water ride which I didn't finish but I've got a lot of work done on it so it's looking pretty nice yeah all right that's about it I saw you were pushing more shorts to your channel this week yeah it doesn't matter like I looked at my last 90 days I've lost 50 subs so how the fuck does that happen
1785782	1787003	I don't expect you to know the answer.
1787103	1788444	Like, were 50 accounts banned?
1788524	1788844	I don't know.
1788884	1789665	It's just weird.
1789745	1791726	That's a big number for no reason.
1792167	1809159	So, essentially what it is is my channel this entire year has been flat for like the last 365 days aside from when I because I got tired of seeing no growth of the channel so I was like, okay, let's try one of these YouTube promotion things.
1809659	1814663	And that worked okay, but there's a lot you shed a lot of subs off of that as well because I don't know
1815445	1819770	BOTS are picking up on the advertised stuff, which is weird.
1820831	1828660	I've had mixed results with that stuff in the past, but it certainly seems like the stuff integrated through YouTube is awful, and it's not...
1829759	1834600	I don't know why they don't really push my content I put it out short for example, I put it out short yesterday um
1858507	1860049	I think it's only been viewed about 50 times.
1860610	1865395	But now if I delete that and re-upload it, it may hit like 2,000 views.
1865596	1866777	That's weird.
1867498	1869901	Their algorithm is stupid.
1870141	1871503	I don't know what it is.
1872504	1875668	And it's... There's not much I can do about it.
1875788	1876449	It's the most popular.
1879366	1880746	I have stuff on TikTok.
1881266	1884667	It is... That is even worse than YouTube.
1885087	1886007	It doesn't work.
1886227	1887768	Like, I'm telling you, I don't know what it is.
1887988	1900370	Well, as of habit, whatever it is you make, because it's the same video, and now especially that YouTube can go up to three minutes, you know, the same short should go to YouTube, TikTok, and I think Instagram is also three minutes at this point.
1900410	1901951	I think you can do threads now, too.
1902191	1903251	Yeah, I just don't...
1904011	1931617	it just doesn't your audiences don't cross over really with that stuff I find so it just doesn't make sense for me to do that and then just in general like you know this stuff that I'm doing now it is tough like I had someone reach out the other day and they looked at like some of the stuff I'm doing on my channel and like tried to help out with like why they think you know people are not doing it but like the stuff that their feedback was based off of like
1932529	1956207	watching a video the problem is that people don't watch the videos at all so like you can't even get to that point where you're saying well it's because your first like 30 seconds weren't engaging enough or whatever the case may be but then also like you have to change the entire style of how you make content then if you you know and do you want to like do you want to be authentic or do you want to jiggle the keys in front of the like the babies watching your your content like I don't know
1958241	1960164	What necessarily I need to do there.
1961185	1965371	I get that struggle is that basically you feel like that advice is like, be totally inauthentic.
1965451	1966493	And then it's like, what am I doing?
1966533	1967113	It is pretty much.
1967354	1969897	People want a product.
1969937	1970438	I've heard that.
1970718	1973502	They're like, have you tried making videos more like Mr. Beast?
1973602	1973863	I'm like...
1974884	2004368	I don't want to and there already is a MrBeast I think it's cheap when people try to emulate him sorry not sorry I think people that try to chase those trends are I think it's very transparent very transparent there's a lot of different styles of how to make like SMP content and I've seen like I know because I look at other SMP content and see like what they're doing and they're doing the same thing if not like less quality and it's still getting more views and it's like
2005734	2006715	I don't know what to do here.
2008557	2011160	You always hear the advice of, well, just put out better content.
2012081	2013562	I put out pretty good content.
2013702	2017126	And they're like, well, you just need to
2018317	2019458	Make better thumbnails then.
2019638	2022720	Okay, I don't know how... What do you want me to do?
2022760	2034207	Like, I'm already, like, turning up the saturation because, you know, for whatever reason... And I'm saying babies, but I'm, like, comparing, like, people with extremely short attention spans, I guess.
2035047	2036808	Really, like, the bright colors shown in the face.
2036828	2038249	Like, it's so stupid.
2038309	2043853	It's like I'm, like, building content for, like, a non-human person.
2043893	2044433	Like, it's just...
2045532	2045912	I don't know.
2046352	2051253	It's like, oh, I need the bright and shiny and the loud noises shouted into my eyes and ears.
2053454	2054614	I get the frustration.
2054934	2057915	I feel like we're repeating ourselves a little bit from last week, but that's okay.
2058135	2059815	I get the frustrations for sure.
2060435	2072418	I'm glad you're sticking with it, at least in staying true to yourself in the whole process, because if nothing else, this will be a time capsule of who you were and what you did during this time frame, just to show
2073118	2075900	has done for us over two decades.
2076161	2084347	And for better or for worse, you go back to the old shows and it's like, oh, some of it's kind of cringe, but then it's like, oh, some of it, wow, we actually kind of called a couple things there.
2084367	2085668	Oh, I just kind of need to see these things.
2085748	2087450	And Bobby, and I get it.
2087690	2092774	There are younger viewers, but it's not necessarily the case.
2092794	2096617	There's actually quite a lot of people that are much older that are watching content.
2096657	2100661	And that's the thing, is there is content that's built that way where it's very...
2101501	2106544	Quick Cuts and Shouty and just oversaturize the hell and all that stuff.
2106744	2110927	And that doesn't appeal to these people, whereas there's other types of content out there.
2111287	2118491	And I looked at demographics and stuff, and I had at one point, there was a lot of my age people watching the content.
2118591	2122213	So it's... I'm not really making it for kids.
2122373	2129998	Would it be a stretch to say that, okay, if it is an older crowd, could it be that your content is...
2131761	2136603	Lens Itself Well to the mom or dad or parent, whatever, can watch with their kid.
2137824	2138584	That it's for both.
2139465	2140485	Yeah, it's for both.
2140565	2140905	I don't know.
2141425	2144447	I think it's hard to say because it's hard...
2146269	2168232	I don't know because like one other thing too as I look at like you know large creators like the Hermitcraft creators problem there is they have such an ingrained audience it doesn't really matter what they do like they can make videos the old school way of making videos like minimal editing just build and talk to camera and that's it and
2169099	2171980	They can get away with that because they already have the established audience.
2172080	2177261	It's not necessarily... They're getting more viewers because of who they already are.
2178541	2185463	I can't do that in the same way because I don't just get invited to a large server because of timing and everything.
2186904	2191425	Unfortunately, right now, there aren't really larger servers to go to or more popular servers.
2191465	2196066	There's short-term SMPs, but those are so clicky that...
2197679	2207564	it's the same group of people in all of these SMPs it's the same people just jumping between these different projects so yeah it's hard to
2208602	2210024	are the same.
2210104	2214649	It's a lot more evergreen than a lot of content, too.
2214689	2215710	Obviously, it's appreciated.
2215890	2227482	The people from my server were visiting today, and they were just checking out the plushies and stuff, because that was the thing I put out last week, is I built this whole redemption system with...
2229062	2250921	essentially, you play the games you get the little prize tickets like you do at Chuck E. Cheese or something like that your ticket games so everything spits tickets for free, because it's the end of the season, and then you go and grab your tickets, you run over to the machine and it redeems a random plushie that pops out and they were entertained for at least a few hours doing that
2251755	2271745	so it is they appreciate it I just wish like other people would be excited about it as well because it's hard to like get into these large projects if no one cares like that's the thing I killed myself last season like really like putting together a lot of stuff with the Mega Man builds and it's like no one saw it like it
2272445	2294514	you know I don't know a lot of people in chat just saying it's luck it is so yeah keep keep scratching those lottery tickets all right uh let's see moving on let's talk about my gaming week okay well speaking of like all is old is new again oh I can't believe I'm gonna admit this but I also don't care I'm kind of at the point where I'm like I don't give a fuck you can say whatever you want about what I'm playing I have been playing World of Warcraft
2295134	2300378	because the classic version of World of Warcraft relaunched this last week.
2300418	2303060	So what I mean is World of Warcraft... It's a classic classic?
2303120	2303361	It is.
2303581	2305082	It's classic classic because...
2305543	2308565	World of Warcraft turned 20 years old, believe it or not.
2308585	2309766	That game is old.
2310947	2312308	And in celebration of that.
2312348	2315410	So I don't know if you know, but there was Classic WoW.
2315911	2322235	But now Classic WoW has progressed through different... They kept, I think, two or three servers forever on Classic.
2322656	2328080	But then they started moving servers through Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King...
2328700	2329982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2345100	2346441	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2362709	2390304	but it's been fun like it's been especially considering you know with everything with Alan being sick and stuff I've just been kind of stuck at home I haven't really wanted to play something new or flashy like sometimes you just want to go back to good old comfort food you know like why why do I keep playing this silly game you know what because I like it it's just it tickles the brain waves I want to have tickled it's like going back to watch the same old TV show or the same old movie it's very that
2391224	2398934	Speaking of movie, I'm very sad because we had tickets to see Wicked on Wednesday night and we had to let him go because Alan couldn't go, but I feel bad he's sick.
2399215	2399896	Yeah, it sucks.
2400436	2401177	Hopefully he'll get better.
2402270	2402570	Really?
2403090	2403330	That?
2403510	2406652	I don't think I really played a lot else new in my gaming week.
2406712	2407792	It was really just that.
2407972	2416295	So I've been on just a little bit of a break from my own YouTube channel and creating videos, but I'm looking to getting back on the bandwagon this week.
2416895	2429799	Also, now I have confirmed the YouTube Shorts thing works, meaning now if you upload a video over a minute in length, but under three minutes, it automatically goes into the...
2431680	2432641	Wow Shorts thing now.
2432741	2435903	So I will be catching up on my backlog of classic shorts.
2436804	2437044	Awesome.
2437084	2439465	Oh, PodCulture says he has a handful of wow codes for Mountain Dew.
2439565	2439846	Great.
2439906	2440546	Hey, I'll take them.
2440606	2441106	Thank you very much.
2441146	2441647	Appreciate that.
2442067	2442287	Okay.
2442747	2447511	On a completely separate sort of note, I promised one of our listeners something.
2447591	2447951	Hold on.
2451007	2452528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2479116	2480598	So again, this is something from Ranma.
2481019	2481900	So let's see what this is.
2483262	2484083	Oh my gosh.
2484844	2485705	I can already see.
2485725	2486426	This is funny.
2487287	2491753	This is not a DarkSakura and Loki present, I'm sorry to say.
2492053	2494697	This is very much a Rob present when you see what this is.
2500194	2501474	Sorry for the dead air silence.
2501494	2502775	How much pumpkin spice is in it?
2502895	2503755	Nope, none.
2503915	2505555	It's a Richard Simmons pop figure.
2509256	2511636	As I said, very much a Rob present.
2512617	2513577	I might have bought you one.
2514557	2515657	I know.
2517958	2518958	Thank you, Ranma.
2519398	2520358	I appreciate it.
2520878	2521539	It's adorable.
2524079	2525039	I mean, seriously.
2526360	2528440	I might have gotten you a Richard Simmons thing as well.
2529895	2531136	but I don't know if I gave it to you or not.
2531776	2532277	Loves it.
2533057	2533417	Alright.
2533697	2534098	Yeah.
2536139	2536459	Yes.
2537560	2539881	Ranma says, I know how much Richard Simmons means to you.
2540022	2541863	Yes, he was wonderful.
2541883	2547827	I'm really, that's one of the shittiest things about this year is that he's no longer with us but, you know, what can you do?
2547867	2548247	What can you do?
2549383	2552465	All right, let's move on and get into... Thank you again, Ranma.
2552485	2552985	I appreciate that.
2553065	2556448	Let's get into... The holidays have officially begun.
2556528	2557849	I've unboxed the first present.
2558249	2560991	All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.
2561071	2564913	Again, for a holiday week, I'm surprised we actually have a bit of news.
2565414	2567515	I will also say this as a reminder.
2567615	2570017	We will not be here in two weeks.
2571238	2574900	I will be out of town on the 15th, so I won't be here.
2575000	2577502	So we'll be taking a break after next week.
2578302	2579123	All right, in the meantime,
2580184	2583387	And DarkSakura, I can hear you ruffling wrestling over there, just FYI.
2583987	2586229	Yeah, it's something I needed to grab real quick.
2586269	2586789	Yeah, you're fine.
2587550	2588751	Loki, let's get into the news.
2589632	2602683	I know this is going to come as a shock, but corporations who put out mobile games that have loot boxes in them and that make so much money, they might not necessarily follow the laws when it comes to
2603834	2604314	Thanks for watching!
2630417	2634939	in their advertisements under the current regulations.
2635139	2644343	It says, of those 45, 26 were labeled as including loot boxes, and 22 of which were actively advertised at the same time.
2645164	2655508	The given example of Monopoly Go, which is a very popular mobile game, does not correctly advertise the usage of loot boxes in its game.
2656669	2656909	So...
2658200	2662343	I'm sure that's only because the penalties for not doing so are probably very minimal.
2663224	2668227	I was going to say that where's the... Yeah, and SJ100 Matt in chat says, this is what happens when you don't hold folks accountable.
2668287	2669488	So, of course, there's my next question.
2669508	2670509	Where's the accountability then?
2671512	2671953	I don't know.
2690413	2691914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2716365	2716665	Right?
2717405	2718826	So that would be the follow-up story.
2719686	2720707	What is their response?
2721507	2728810	Their response is this is an ongoing area of our work and we're closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.
2729150	2730651	In other words, they don't have a handle on it.
2733185	2736706	It's too hard to regulate this.
2737326	2739827	Well, and to be fair, it is.
2740488	2744529	There are so many mobile games and mobile apps.
2744889	2746790	It is hard to regulate, yes.
2747390	2756993	But when you have the top games completely ignoring the rules, I mean, at least look at the top 100 and start making examples of some folks.
2757073	2760514	And that's how you get everybody else to go to the rules real quick.
2761190	2765871	I don't know how you can really force that with advertisers.
2765931	2773072	They basically say, although it's upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things.
2773672	2776873	They will go to a company and say you should comply, but then they don't comply.
2778293	2787175	So people are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and it is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.
2789332	2812652	so what is the point of this whole point is we should be calling them surprise mechanics surprise yeah yeah and uh you know a couple people in chat Hector's pointing out they're short-staffed right now everyone's short-staffed right now as Joe and Hunter Matt says they don't have the personnel to track these down or follow up on claims that involves hiring staff to do this which they aren't doing so I mean then we might as well all admit the rule is pointless
2816536	2817016	What can we do?
2817257	2817717	What can you do?
2818818	2819098	All right.
2819619	2822861	Well, let's talk about one of the biggest mobile games out there right now.
2822981	2829907	I don't know how much you have all messed around with the Pokemon trading card game pocket, but I actually have been playing.
2830187	2837994	I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but I've actually been playing this game a lot because you get two free packs a day to open and I have it on.
2838174	2839475	I know 11 a.m.
2839515	2840316	and 11 p.m.
2840536	2841817	are when my packs come up.
2842197	2843518	and I'll open up a free pack.
2843898	2847780	I've not spent a dollar on this game and I still feel like I've gotten quite a bit out of it.
2848980	2852982	And, you know, I've done a lot of these limited battles and things you can do in it and the card collecting.
2853323	2862667	I've added a few of you from our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord as friends on the game and doing what... I've gotten some good cards from some of you people in the Wonder Trade type of thing.
2863147	2865729	Anyway, I like the way they did it.
2865869	2868930	I never thought I would get into the Pokemon trading card game.
2869350	2870111	But they did the...
2870911	2887136	The way Dina, or whoever is the studio behind this, did this game where they really made the focus, the collecting of the cards is really the focus of the game, and the actual card game itself is a scaled-down version of the Pokemon trading card game.
2888336	2889617	It's more like the sideshow.
2889757	2892578	It's not actually the main feature of the app.
2892878	2894958	I think it's a really brilliant way how they put it together.
2896059	2897379	And yeah, it's...
2897659	2898520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2923544	2923925	Let's see.
2925306	2925806	I had the list here.
2925826	2926067	Oh, yes.
2926127	2930390	Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.
2930510	2935374	Now, before I get corrected in chat, that event just launched.
2936695	2943421	But it's still noteworthy to say that this stuff was datamined before that event started, I think yesterday, which is actually a Venusaur event.
2943801	2967131	EX card event in the game which I have a very good fire deck by the way to go up against this but the way I do everything the other awesome thing about the Pokemon trading card game is that when you go into these battles you can just set it on auto battle and you don't ever have to actually play the game you just let the computer do the whole thing for you and sometimes you win sometimes you don't but if you have a pretty good deck
2967631	2994527	you usually win more often than not and you can get some of these cards in your inventory and of course everything is on a stamina mechanic as you would expect so you can only do so many of these you know so many a day but you know as long as you go in there and you do a couple a day it's pretty easy so like I went into my game and there's the event going on and you can actually you'll notice there the bottom corner is a little switch auto off but if I turn that to on
2995469	2996469	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3012150	3018218	So, yeah, and Shane's in chat saying, if only it was a Venusaur, since that would have been nicer to have a Fulard of.
3018598	3023925	Shane also points out that Magnemite, which was in the leak, actually was not in this event.
3023985	3025667	So that could be something that's coming later.
3026028	3027029	Because they did do...
3028746	3029887	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3045220	3061999	I guess the point behind all of this is, this game is big enough now where people are trying to, you know, heck, of course, with Pokemon being involved there, without surprise, people are trying to datamine the app updates to figure out what are the things that are coming to the game and all that good stuff.
3062960	3063560	So, yeah.
3064381	3091775	apparently these pack points I didn't know this this article is saying that the pack points actually have an unknown expiration date so you want to spend those pack points which I haven't spent any of them I have like 600 of them I just need to pick up a bunch of cards that I don't have at some point because I think they're saying the first expansion or the next set of cards is supposed to be out in January which would make sense you do every three months or so that's about four a year that's gonna be a pretty good one so yeah
3092395	3093096	And there we go.
3093196	3094017	PodCulture.
3094057	3095038	We converted one.
3095098	3098441	PodCulture says, God damn it, I'm going to have to download this one.
3098481	3099062	There we go.
3099762	3100883	Shane, you should be proud of me.
3100923	3101744	We won one over.
3104287	3104547	All right.
3105087	3105368	Anyway.
3107029	3107550	Moving on.
3107810	3109131	Let's move on.
3109171	3109972	Talk about some more news.
3110072	3110353	Loki.
3110593	3111674	I'm sorry, DarkSakura, what do you have?
3113800	3116502	I have stuff.
3116783	3130594	So because, I guess, of reasons, I don't know what the reasons are, but Xbox is removing avatars, at least from Xbox One and the Xbox series.
3131095	3133036	Anything you have on 360 is still there.
3134818	3151093	but nah, they were around but they're going of course we know they were introduced back with the Xbox 360 there was an update for them in 2008 and Microsoft was like, oh behind them you can buy clothes and do stuff with them and run around and cause havoc
3152654	3176757	but then they just stopped supporting them bit by bit and now the support page for the avatars is gone and they said as of January 9th 2025 they will be removed from those newer consoles their avatars will not appear on profile pages and they say it's due to low engagement and the Xbox avatar editor is also going away too
3178200	3181262	Oops.
3182622	3194368	One thing, if you purchased items for your avatars on an Xbox One or the series, since November 1st, 2023, you will have those purchases refunded.
3196052	3197153	That's kind of nice, at least.
3198014	3198214	Yeah.
3198454	3200336	Yeah, I don't think I've really used the avatars.
3200416	3202398	I definitely remember setting up an avatar.
3202759	3206743	And I absolutely remember I had a Taylor Swift microphone.
3207864	3210106	And I didn't have it because it was Taylor Swift.
3210126	3212629	I mean, sure, she's fine, but I'm not obsessed like a lot of people are.
3214090	3215412	From the game Band Hero.
3215752	3217754	Remember when all the Guitar Hero knockoffs came off?
3217774	3218515	There was Band Hero.
3218535	3218695	Mm-hmm.
3218855	3233343	and I had because I had a little pink strand on it and so my character would dance around with a microphone little pink strand I was like I love it so that was my like thing for forever but yeah I don't remember the last time I've seen that on the Xbox system to be honest
3234554	3243180	So it's kind of faded out of view with all these dashboard updates they've done for the Series S and X. And they don't use them in the games anymore.
3243541	3247784	At some point they were using them in the games, but again, I think that all faded away with the Xbox 360.
3247884	3249165	I haven't really seen them lately.
3249645	3252587	So, I mean, shout out to those of you still using GamerPix.
3253749	3256290	I still, to this day, have the OLR gamer pic.
3256330	3257750	I'm never going to fucking change it either.
3257810	3258290	Why would I?
3258770	3262371	I have the OLR gamer pic on my profile, as some of you do too.
3262391	3264172	I know Bobby Blackwolf has his little Blackwolf.
3264512	3266432	You can't get those gamer pics anymore, by the way.
3266472	3267853	They went away a long time ago.
3268613	3275975	Whatever deal with All Games Radio and Xbox, whatever went through at the time, that got delisted after a few years.
3277555	3281336	Some of you maybe still have gamer pics from around that time.
3283652	3291775	Anyway, Sjohn Hunter Matt in chat says, I bought a hockey jersey for my avatar, so I guess I contributed to it, though I think not enough folks bought into it to keep it alive.
3292315	3295416	I liked how certain achievements would get you clothes.
3295556	3298197	I think that's where my Taylor Swift microphone came from.
3298237	3299037	I don't think I bought it.
3299397	3303899	I think I had it from maybe singing scores and songs or something.
3303939	3304259	I don't know.
3304539	3307220	But I think it was achievement related, and that was really fun.
3307880	3315085	and was a really cool thing they were supposed to do with PlayStation Home that I think very few games leaned into.
3315426	3335480	But this whole concept of achievements going beyond just a seal on your profile, which I know I've brought this up before, but the coolest achievements there's ever been was in the Atari 2600 days on the Activision games when you would take a picture of the screen when you got above a certain score and
3335700	3336321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3357477	3360219	I'm sure you can make patches and get them on Etsy and things like that.
3361379	3370004	I like that whole way of really being able to show off your trophies on a shelf as opposed to just the checkmark on your profile.
3370384	3375707	Although I guess now we have PlayStation 5 records the video clips when you unlock trophies.
3376107	3378929	So I guess there's that, but that's all there is.
3381097	3408571	SG100 Matt says if you got that image of the OLR Bobby Black will show gamertag image and clip it you can upload it to your profile online oh that's gonna we have the original image it's very it's a very small very easy it's all pixel art so I'm happy to put that in the discord if anybody ever wants that Bobby will have to speak on his own logo but we can put the OLR one Loki made that actually that pixel art for OLR so I'm sure he won't mind we just give that shit away at this point so don't mind
3410373	3437875	we do have a similar one now that I think about it we have a VOG one that's similar it's like the same style but obviously it came later but it's a very very similar style so anyway and by the way my computer player won the match thank you very much Flareon, too strong anytime Flareon comes out I'm going to win that match because Flareon is fucking amazing anyway
3439012	3439613	Let's move on.
3439773	3440613	Loki, what do we have next?
3441694	3442654	All right.
3442994	3449077	So Microsoft is blaming Google for the fact that you can't buy Xbox games on its app.
3449237	3451979	I mean, it's pretty straightforward why that is the case.
3452459	3462604	So right now, of course, Android devices have to have all their apps go through the Google payment system, and they take a 30% fee from that.
3463305	3466486	However, as you may remember, you know, with the whole Epic versus...
3467987	3475850	Google Settlement or Court Case that now they're supposed to be allowed to go around that.
3475890	3479011	They don't have to use those payment systems.
3479691	3491816	However, right now, and this was shared by Sarah Bond on Blue Sky saying, I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S.,
3492256	3505644	While other app stores adapt to meet the consumer demand, due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts from that court case, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned.
3505684	3514030	So right now, because there's a stay on that case, it hasn't concluded yet, and so now that's why...
3515260	3521987	because otherwise they have to pay them 30% of all of the game sales they do which I don't think they want to share that.
3523748	3527492	As should they because it doesn't go through Android at all.
3527712	3536000	It makes sense if you're running a mobile app through using the Google Play stuff but
3536954	3540256	If you're buying a game on Xbox, why should they get that money?
3540496	3541097	They should not.
3541517	3544419	Yeah, I get it.
3544559	3553385	I know Pikmin Bloom, which I play a lot of the Niantic games now have their web store to try to get around the 30% cut or whatever.
3553745	3557127	And in Pikmin Bloom, you can freaking tap a link and it takes you to the web store.
3557588	3561750	And I was actually kind of surprised that that's baked right into the mobile thing.
3561870	3564572	But yeah, kind of interesting.
3564792	3565673	So, hmm.
3566803	3568285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3584601	3586902	It is a bit, yeah, it's a bit ridiculous.
3587102	3588223	Yeah, so I get it.
3588983	3595605	If anything, they should get a cut similar to what a Walmart, a Target, an Amazon gets.
3596106	3605849	Like if we want to talk about what would be, you know, take whatever the difference is between buying it at cost from the publisher and what the markup is for retail, that should be what it should look like.
3605889	3607670	And I don't know if that's what that looks like.
3607690	3609291	I'm surprised that they didn't just...
3610376	3627770	say, hey, like, because my, maybe they did, I don't know, I don't know enough details of what all the negotiations were, but, like, I would think that, obviously, like, if you think about it, I mean, surely they're going to try to get 30%, because if you're not going to fight them on it, then they'll be like, yeah, easy money.
3628171	3637618	But, like, I would think at that point when it was like, well, no, we want to give you nothing of it, like, I would have almost wondered if they're like, well, okay, how about we negotiate, like, a
3638655	3638996	Yeah, yeah.
3639036	3640839	Yeah, negotiate a flat rate, you're supposed to...
3649773	3650254	and DarkSakura.
3675157	3684764	They still may have fought it, but I think that would have been a little bit easier for them to kind of come to grips with and probably would not have taken this to court, I would think.
3687507	3693972	Alright, well, an issue that will continue to be developed is cloud gaming is going to get bigger and bigger, so we'll see.
3694772	3701978	Alright, well, moving on, let's talk about what shocking, shocking development the Nintendo Switch eShop is closing.
3702778	3703039	What?
3703439	3704300	Yes, it's closing.
3705049	3706070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3720666	3723207	just in China is still a pretty big exception.
3723247	3725608	Like China's a very big market for games.
3725648	3727689	So this is still pretty, pretty big news.
3728749	3732531	But yeah, and I don't know, Jamie, I know you said it's about the crackdown.
3732671	3736353	It seems to be, it might be, but we actually don't know.
3736473	3743636	Nobody is stating a reason for why the Nintendo eShop is closing in China, but we do know it's going to be in 2026.
3744136	3747377	So it's still a ways out, but on March 31st, 2026,
3749478	3754120	The Digital Store is no longer going to sell games, no more free trials, and none of that is available.
3754840	3763223	As of May 15th, 2026, Nintendo will stop download, code redemption, no more redeemable DLC, none of that.
3763723	3766644	All other network-related services close on May 15th, 2026.
3766684	3767525	No reason as to why.
3771246	3792145	but also kind of interesting there is a reward program that has been announced for the application WeChat which I believe is pretty big in China where you can get up to four Nintendo games from now until March 31st when this all wraps up and it includes some pretty big heavy hitters Mario Odyssey, New Super Mario Bros.
3792245	3797470	U Deluxe Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Party so it's a lot of the big even Pokemon in here
3797970	3799071	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3813228	3816631	But only people can infer the why.
3817172	3828522	We know that the government has been putting out more rules, trying to limit spending in online games, trying to curb this perceived video game addiction in young people and so forth.
3829143	3838511	And no idea what this means when it comes to the Switch 2, since we know that's a thing that is inevitably going to get announced at the beginning of next year.
3839492	3841414	And now we can say that is a fact.
3841494	3846779	It will be announced early next year because Nintendo has said before the end of the financial year they're going to announce the console.
3846799	3847359	They've said this.
3847879	3850562	But assumably at this point, not in China.
3851883	3855906	Unless there's going to be a different thing in China or different rules.
3855986	3857408	It doesn't have the online.
3858048	3858449	I don't know.
3859490	3861651	There's still a lot to figure out what that looks like.
3862092	3862432	But that's...
3863769	3865110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3875165	3875505	Don't know.
3875986	3876746	Too soon to tell.
3877607	3884092	And especially when we don't really know the reason, we're just having to infer based on these different laws we see in China.
3885033	3885653	We don't know yet.
3885773	3887014	So we'll see what happens.
3887334	3895341	But I would expect when Nintendo announces Switch 2, you're not going to hear anything about territories outside of the U.S.,
3896021	3899163	your typical European territories, and Japan.
3899603	3908968	You may hear, you know, I shouldn't say the US, I should say North America to include parts of Central and South America in the places where Nintendo has traditionally had a presence.
3909368	3914771	I just don't, I think China's probably going to be left out of the conversation there early on in those announcements.
3915211	3916292	So, we'll see.
3916912	3921875	S2100 Matt says, just wait for the Chinese knockoff consoles, aka the many Wii knockoffs.
3922015	3922976	Oh, you mean the V?
3924216	3925117	The Nontendo V?
3928120	3929300	I think there was a YouTube out there.
3929340	3930361	Somebody playing one of those.
3931581	3931801	Fun.
3932522	3932802	All right.
3933442	3936923	DarkSakura, what do you have next for us?
3937043	3938724	Well, this is some sad news.
3939124	3943045	We need a moment of silence for Humanoid Origin.
3943725	3946406	Looks like this studio is going to be shutting down.
3947387	3950488	It is a... It's only been around for three years.
3950568	3950888	It was...
3958130	3965672	And it was a LinkedIn post where basically said that there was no way to protect the employees.
3966472	3971974	They were left with little funding and they could no longer sustain operations.
3973935	3985580	and so it was really sad because they started building this whole sci-fi universe that was going to be put out on the AAA platforms out there but
3987515	4001001	They had to stop and they were hiring as of May, but something flipped and the studio wrote, I'll read the quote, we're heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science fiction universe to completion.
4001521	4007664	Our main concern at this time, however, is for our team and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment.
4010105	4010425	Hmm.
4012406	4015007	That's very sudden with the hiring and everything.
4015027	4015667	That's very sad.
4019307	4025434	Well, I expect a lot of things shifting during a transitional period, too.
4027923	4034429	You know, and this also goes to show when, you know, we hear about layoffs in the industry, which are always, you know, hard to hear about.
4034549	4037431	Sometimes there's that, well, they'll just go off and form a new studio.
4038032	4041074	Well, that doesn't always end in success either.
4041254	4046339	Now, I think Casey Hudson left of his own, you know, accord, but I don't remember.
4046399	4047520	Was he laid off or did he leave?
4047640	4049321	I thought he left voluntarily, but...
4050462	4056626	I can guess that a lot of these people that were working here were probably picked up from other studio layoffs and so forth.
4056666	4060768	And so it's kind of a bummer that their game didn't even really get to have a chance.
4060908	4062189	But it takes a lot of money.
4062229	4068953	It takes a lot of investment to make a game, especially when you have a whole team of people behind it and you're making a pretty big game.
4069393	4072975	And so it's sad when your game's not able to get there.
4073996	4074276	Bummer.
4077038	4078038	Well, moving on.
4078759	4078959	Loki.
4080376	4088362	Alright, so of course, everybody has to leave at some point.
4089623	4098550	Whether you've been at a company for a very long time, like in this case, Shuhei Yoshida, it's time to move on from PlayStation.
4098650	4107577	So he headed up independent development at PlayStation for the past 30 years, and now is actually going to be leaving January 15th.
4108818	4109598	of next year.
4110419	4113040	And now he's not retiring.
4113080	4113900	He's going to be work.
4114040	4119202	He wants to still be working in the games industry in some capacity, but he's pretty much done.
4120362	4120962	That's so nice.
4120982	4121562	He's done all he can do.
4121602	4124243	I imagine he'll do consultant type of work from here.
4124483	4131746	Maybe, I mean, maybe some sort of new operation, but I feel like this lends itself more to consultancy and that type of thing.
4131766	4133666	Maybe on the board of another company or something.
4136567	4137328	You know what that means?
4137348	4137708	What?
4138629	4140490	The Amico's coming back, baby!
4141891	4142311	Stop.
4143892	4160261	Yeah, I mean, obviously this guy's had a long career at Sony, and, you know, after the PlayStation 3... I wouldn't say the PlayStation 3 did bad, but obviously it had a very slow start, and, you know, had that recovery, but then it was really, you know, Yoshida that kind of led into the PlayStation 4 era...
4161421	4184915	and you know you mentioned he did a lot with you know kind of the smaller studios and you know indies and stuff and I think you really saw that really weaved into in a way uh you didn't see PlayStation 2 before with the PlayStation 4 you know and how readily available you know games on the store are and are very present in things like PlayStation Plus and the giveaways and so forth you know you definitely um see Yoshida's influence there so um
4185655	4210089	Yeah obviously he he led Sony out of a difficult period into a period of much bigger successes and so um I think he leaves behind a company you know I don't know I know there's a lot of mixed things on PlayStation 5 and kind of especially when it comes to like the VR2 and some do we need to really need a PS5 Pro and some of this other stuff I'd like to kind of think that's a little more out of what he's probably directly dealing with a little more but
4210789	4211810	Hope he enjoys his semi-retirement.
4229383	4232385	I say semi-retirement because I do think he shows up somewhere else.
4232745	4239769	Whether he's consulting on a game or forms some sort of advocacy or publishing group maybe.
4240089	4240389	I don't know.
4240769	4242630	But I can see him maybe taking it to a smaller scale.
4242690	4246953	But I bet he would still be involved with helping indie games get to console.
4247413	4250495	I could see he could still have a very big career at that if he wants.
4253657	4253857	Well...
4255100	4256481	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4279295	4298982	but you know a lot of League of Legends affiliated properties have been seeing success Arcane on Netflix obviously is the thing that comes to mind apparently season one of that show was incredible season two people are also loving I'm hearing season two it kind of starts slow but by the time it ends you're like fuck that was good but it's also very
4299802	4305083	I've also heard it's very much the last season, like they're not going to be doing a season three or anything else beyond this for Arcane.
4305403	4310364	But it's still really big and getting eyes on, you know, that universe, the League of Legends universe.
4311124	4325887	Well, around this same sort of time, Riot has added some new things to the terms of service that can take action against players for behavior occurring, quote, "...across various places that touch their gaming experience."
4326627	4331451	That can include penalties, suspensions, and even Riot-wide bans.
4332252	4340619	And you have until January 3rd of next year, so 2025, so you have about a month, to adjust your content to these new rules.
4341299	4346744	Now, Riot Games is not going to proactively search social media for violations, but...
4347264	4358309	Players can report cases about players badly behaving, say on a live stream where one of the games serves as the background of the content produced.
4359009	4368013	And if Riot determines that the player is violating terms of service, Riot could issue a penalty as if that behavior occurred in the game.
4369090	4369410	DarkSakura,
4391158	4412903	but the reality is when you have the banner of League of Legends behind you then what you say is reflective of the League of Legends community and if Riot doesn't want that to reflect on their game or their community they are under no obligation to let you continue to do that for free and that's the reality whether you like it or not
4414747	4418868	So behave yourselves and don't go openly cheating.
4419268	4425950	Don't go being an asshole and don't be like playing League of Legends and then say, oh, I got matched with Loki.
4426230	4427190	That guy sucks.
4427430	4429790	Let's all go into Loki's chat and tell him how much he sucks.
4430090	4436132	Like that's behavior that could get you punished as it should.
4437512	4464807	it is very reminiscent of Twitch changing this similar type of behavior you might remember during the opening ceremony at TwitchCon in Las Vegas you could get suspended or banned if you dox or swat other players even if you're not necessarily live when you do it so you're accountable for not being a shithead when you're doing things that could still represent the company that you are making money off of
4465851	4470414	There's no such thing as freedom of speech when you're using a platform that gives you terms of service.
4471975	4483442	Freedom of speech only has to deal with speaking about the government without having repercussions like jailing or fining from the government.
4483843	4494089	And on the flip side, you cannot brand your company the town hall or the bastion of free speech while you have a terms of service that actively works against that.
4494670	4495090	Just saying.
4497742	4498062	That's all.
4498342	4498542	Yep.
4499623	4500363	Hashtag deal with it.
4500483	4500843	That's right.
4501463	4505604	Well, let's go back to a simpler time before social media ruined everything.
4506105	4515187	And we're going to take a look at not the classic game of the week, but once a month, DarkSakura takes a look at the canceled game of the month.
4515767	4517028	Roll that bumper.
4518708	4520449	If I can find that bumper, roll that bumper.
4520469	4520749	Here it is.
4531351	4552557	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week but as previously mentioned DarkSakura likes to once a month check out a classic cancelled game of the week so what are we going to see this week DarkSakura?
4554118	4557999	what we are seeing this week is Primal Rage 2
4559460	4573365	and yes, there have been releases of this that showed up in arcades as test units but we're going to go ahead and just take a little bit of step back on this one because for a while people thought this one was lost and gone so
4576787	4578327	Sorry, I still have that cough.
4579688	4581509	So it was a sequel to Primal Rage.
4581689	4583070	It began its development in 1996.
4583590	4591274	It was meant to be released in 1997, but it was cancelled a few months after Midway acquired Atari Games.
4592533	4611387	there has only one known cabinet to exist and it is at last check at Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois and if any of our listeners are in or near that area if you would check that out and make sure that that's still good send us a picture
4614349	4623012	So basically, the way the story for this goes is that the original characters were trapped and could not fight against each other directly.
4623592	4626954	So they have representatives amongst their human worshippers to fight.
4627894	4631115	And they have the ability to morph into their god's image.
4631936	4636518	There are new gods to make an appearance, like Slashfang, who is a
4637478	4649132	a fighter that takes the form of a dinophilus and Nekrosan, a dragon skeleton who was originally in the first game and was removed.
4650754	4655900	So they never did get featured in any finished game, but there were toys made for them.
4657922	4674087	So, the story was, it was pretty close to the events that were in the first game, and revealed that the meteorite that struck Earth, as in URTH, was an egg holding the dragon beast Necrozon.
4675708	4677690	who wanted to destroy the world.
4678110	4685977	So to protect their world, they united against Necrozan, but they were defeated and imprisoned in half-suspended animation.
4686538	4692263	And so that's when they reached out to the human avatars and then did things to fight.
4694105	4698729	However, for some reason, Atari, I guess, wanted to keep that story going.
4699930	4708037	So even after the game was canceled, they did a novel in 1997 called Primal Rage the Avatars.
4708598	4710700	It was written by John Warnholt.
4711340	4712460	I may have to read this.
4715261	4733887	So the characters were Kaze, who is an avatar of Blizzard, Tor for Armadon, Hina for Talon, Eric for Sauron, Shank for Chaos, Melissa for Vertigo, Sinjin for Diablo, Xiaoming for Slashfang, and then Necrozon.
4735194	4736095	So here we go.
4736996	4743401	There was an alpha build that was floating around the internet, but it had never been properly emulated.
4743521	4745443	It would crash every time you selected a character.
4747805	4755211	And you needed a 558 megabyte CHD image that was supposed to go with it.
4756092	4756252	And...
4757273	4758673	You couldn't really find that either.
4759033	4767595	However, in March 2017, an individual made a modded version of MAME that was called MAME for Rage 2.
4768116	4769916	The numbers are numerical numbers.
4770916	4773437	And were able to emulate it without any issues.
4774077	4775137	And it's out there.
4776437	4782379	This was done by a user named Gruntzilla94.
4784440	4793046	And so now, though the game is canceled, it still lives on in a preserved form out there for people to enjoy.
4798009	4799290	So canceled, but not really.
4799670	4801432	Because it's sort of that.
4801452	4802192	No, canceled.
4802272	4803133	Yeah, I know, I know.
4803613	4804454	It's only alpha build.
4804714	4804874	Yeah.
4806018	4834713	but apparently this emulation is fully functional yeah I was going to say it looks really good you know for it's time I mean it's a primal rage game but I thought that you know the concept behind it is neat I mean clearly people at Atari thought it was neat enough that they wrote a book about it yeah so yeah maybe we'll get a gold master series on it someday maybe they'll finish it who knows alright one can dream hey it's happened before that's true Star Fox 2
4835734	4840757	All right, your classic canceled game of the week, Primal Rage 2.
4842518	4845240	All right, and that means that's December's game, right?
4845540	4857728	So at this point, we should take a trip down memory lane and actually recap what the 12 selections were from this year for the theme, the canceled game of the month.
4858409	4860130	So the canceled game of the month, here we go.
4860270	4861091	Trip down memory lane.
4861171	4863933	January was Capcom Fighting All-Stars.
4864827	4875635	February was Thrill Kill March was Robotech Crystal Dreams April was Mega Man Universe May was Scalebound June was Penn & Teller's Smoke & Mirrors
4881773	4883634	Another one that you can mostly play through.
4884115	4886557	July was Dinosaur Planet, another dinosaur one.
4886997	4888038	That's one I'm sad about.
4888238	4891121	August was the one everybody's pissed about, StarCraft Ghost.
4892041	4893262	Yeah.
4893383	4896806	September was Propeller Arena Aviation Battle Championship.
4897845	4899746	October was Sonic Xtreme.
4900726	4903387	Last month was Sam and Max Freelance Police.
4904067	4905728	And now there you have it rounding out the year.
4906128	4908048	Primal Rage 2 for December.
4908349	4913730	You can check out the entire history of the Classic Game of the Week and cancelled games and all that.
4914971	4916791	The Wikia or Fandom now.
4916871	4920333	So it's orangeloungeradio.fandom.com is where the unofficial OLR Wiki is.
4922228	4926551	So are you ready for the honorable mentions?
4927252	4927672	Oh, sure.
4927732	4928813	Let's hear some honorable mentions.
4929794	4937200	So I did bring up Resident Evil 1.5 because that was a canceled version that eventually got remade into what we had as Resident Evil 2.
4937240	4947208	I had Saints Row Undercover, Bio Force Ape, Liquid Kids, which does have an arcade version, and Rescue.
4947228	4947448	Rescue.
4951685	4952987	So now I need an idea.
4953147	4955069	I don't know what I want to do next year.
4956570	4957731	What should I do, people?
4958472	4959573	Send in those suggestions.
4961174	4961915	Tell me now.
4963576	4963917	All right.
4964457	4965318	Well, let's move on.
4965358	4971944	We're going to get to some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines that happened in the industry quickly.
4972265	4973045	So let's get to it.
4973185	4973446	Loki.
4974574	4985998	Alright, so No Man's Sky, after launching kind of broken and buggy, has finally now received a very positive rating on Steam.
4986998	4999942	It took a very long time for, well, eight years, to essentially get all of the negative ratings outmatched by all the positive ones.
5000262	5001343	And so they finally did it.
5001443	5002263	They pulled it off.
5003857	5006439	No one thought it could happen, but it did.
5018001	5018601	Yeah, it's a lot.
5046291	5051594	Also, we've got word now that 2K has ditched their PC launcher.
5052214	5064720	So before, if you were launching games like Bioshock, the Bioshock Trilogy, The Quarry, Marvel's Midnight Sun, you'd have to launch them through the 2K launcher.
5065881	5068042	But now, you won't have to.
5068222	5069903	You can be able to launch them straight from Steam.
5070303	5073685	And so they updated that and it is not coming back.
5074995	5076878	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5090632	5092052	Oh, something that makes me happy.
5092773	5107077	So, Fantastic Nights Dreams Cotton, which I love, is coming to PS4 and Switch on November 28th due to Arcade Archive.
5107157	5110438	Unlike the $100 that I almost paid to get the PlayStation release.
5110658	5113179	Sorry, the noise full-on came through on stream.
5113199	5113559	Sorry about that.
5113579	5116159	I thought I had them muted, but for some reason they still came up.
5116219	5116460	Sorry.
5116540	5117900	Let's try to show the game.
5119176	5119457	Oh, okay.
5119577	5119758	Sorry.
5120780	5127574	But anyway, it is a shooter that was released by Success in 1991 where you play Cotton and you have
5128104	5132385	Magic, bombs, and all kinds of things to destroy whatever is in your way.
5133005	5138867	And this is a, as it says, it's a faithfully reproduced classic.
5139687	5150230	So you have your adjustable game difficulty, and it is available with menus and manuals in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
5151471	5153471	It's also just kind of hard.
5153491	5154431	I mean, it's a good game.
5154451	5156792	Yeah.
5158103	5165291	Yeah, it looks like kind of a difficult shooter game, but one of those where once you memorize the pattern, I'm sure it gets a little bit easier.
5168084	5170885	Alright, let's see, what do I have for y'all?
5170925	5175467	Let's talk about, oh, some new retro games that have come out for Nintendo Switch Online.
5175767	5184050	You love to see some new games getting released, and the Game Boy Nintendo Switch Online, which I do not believe you need Pro for Game Boy.
5184070	5187632	I think you need Pro or whatever it's called, Expansion Pack, whatever the hell they call it.
5187952	5192094	I think you need that for Game Boy Advance, but for original Game Boy, you get Donkey Kong Land 2.
5193174	5193874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5215123	5222569	Vector Man, and ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, which was the sequel to the original ToeJam & Earl.
5223029	5223910	So, cute.
5224510	5226071	All of that already has come out.
5226212	5228473	It's available for you to check out.
5228854	5233157	That is the same list, by the way, for both the US and Japan.
5233177	5234518	Japan has the same game.
5234578	5237460	Sometimes there's some minor differences, but not with that release.
5238461	5238761	All right.
5239662	5243745	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that you can...
5245151	5245551	Check out.
5246872	5247233	All right.

5404344	5407285	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases there.
5407305	5410106	We have quite a few releases out in Japan as well.
5411167	5423651	So let's start with, I think this one's a worldwide release, Fantasian Neo Dimension, finally coming off of the mobile devices exclusively and onto the Nintendo Switch this week in Japan as well.
5424112	5427453	It was an exclusive mobile device, I should point out.
5427673	5428933	It was Apple Arcade.
5429013	5430414	Yeah, yeah, my bad.
5430834	5439303	but I know they are doing some changes to it to make it controller friendly too because the original involved touchscreens operations if I'm not mistaken, right?
5439323	5443948	Didn't you like draw attack paths and stuff?
5446231	5446951	My brain just blanked out.
5446991	5447592	What did you just say?
5448313	5450255	Wasn't there touch mechanics in the original Fantasian?
5452624	5474122	I never played it on a mobile device, so I don't know I thought they made changes to it to make it, but I know they have made some changes to it just in regards to music mode and things like that that you usually see Oh, it was to arc your attacks, that was it, was what you were doing Okay, that's from Shane in our chatroom
5475023	5475283	All right.
5477146	5482933	Other games that are coming out in Japan this week include Under Defeat is coming out in a regular and limited edition.
5483653	5487918	Fitness Boxing 3, your personal trainer in a regular... No, just kidding.
5487939	5489300	Just a regular edition for that one.
5489941	5490482	We also have...
5490962	5498490	Hone Honezaris Cross Chogatai Build and Battle is out this week on the Switch in Japan as well.
5500072	5503616	And oh, that's like a robot dinosaur thing, of course.
5503936	5505177	We love robot dinosaur games.
5506219	5508881	Stella of the End is out in Japan this week.
5509242	5511544	And Care Bears to the Rescue.
5512185	5535386	which I had no idea there was a modern take on Care Bears but they look like the My Little Pony cartoon I don't know if that's the thing that's kind of the art style what it reminds me of um but that's cool the game actually looks cute I gotta say so this clearly was not I'm sure this game's been out here for a while but uh didn't cross my radar until I saw it on the Japanese releases so how about that on the PlayStation 5 a lot of similar releases as well
5535726	5543834	including Fantasia, Neo Dimension, Under Defeat, also out in Japan, Pacific Drive in Japan, and that's it for the PlayStation 5.
5544535	5546577	Let's go to Europe, DarkSakura.
5548403	5577906	so we have a handful of things we've got on the third we have Warhammer 40k Darktide for PS5 Lorelei and the Laser Eyes for PS4 and PS5 on the fifth we have Fitness Boxing 3 your personal trainer for Switch Delta Force Hawk Ops Open Beta for PC we have Skydance Behemoth and that's for the VR stuff Rollercoaster Tycoon Classic for Switch Infinity Nikki for PC, PS5, Android iOS

5593564	5593824	All right.
5594786	5599913	Well, we have just a few more stories for you, and then we'll invite your calls and other ways to participate with the show.
5600654	5605700	The best way to do that is through our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
5606441	5608204	But first, we have a story from Loki.
5609312	5614577	Yeah, and another week and another set of litigious actions by Nintendo.
5614637	5629853	They are now continuing to go after some Switch pirates, mainly now following up on a case with the subreddit moderator, James Archbox Williams, who runs the
5630994	5635480	aptly named and certainly under the radar SwitchPirates subreddit.
5636641	5641107	And I'm sure that's just people that love the Switch and act like pirates, right?
5642829	5647074	Anyways, they are trying to subpoena... Welcome to SwitchPirates, where it's talk like a pirate day every day.
5647395	5647475	Arr!
5649122	5661594	They're trying to subpoena a bunch of different online provider services to see if they can identify who some of these people are that are a part of this group.
5661694	5670203	So they are subpoenaing Reddit to try to get the user data for the folks, I guess, are posting on there.
5671184	5672124	Not really sure, but...
5672885	5680731	It says, you know, apparently they had a court case with Archbox, but he never showed.
5681591	5689557	And so it's trying to evade, you know, the whole lawsuit, I guess, which is it's not going to happen.
5691721	5699024	They said that, or that apparently right now they're trying to, though, you know, access the Google Drive and Gmail data.
5699504	5702025	That was also involved with that.
5702405	5708527	I don't know if they were hosting some of these on Google Drives, like the files and stuff, but that's probably it.
5708887	5716170	And then, you know, Discord as well to try to get access to the Discord to find out, you know...
5718179	5728426	they find these other multiple other actors who appear to have a role in the pirate shops they were selling you know the pirated games or means to pirate these games
5730379	5731780	Alright, well good luck, I guess.
5732140	5733521	Go and squirt Shirt on everybody.
5733701	5734482	I guess so.
5734622	5738744	They're definitely trying to get as many people as they can.
5739005	5741566	Or they're trying to scare people off of this Reddit, too.
5741626	5744348	I mean, 200,000 people following it is quite a lot of people.
5744368	5748251	Well, that's a little, like, it's just gonna push it more underground is what it's gonna do.
5748271	5757577	Because, like, I mean, yeah, it is kind of bold to be out there, like, hey, look, we're pirating all this stuff, actively shouting to the heavens, hey, look, we're stealing all this.
5757977	5758117	Like,
5761329	5767533	If you think that you're not going to get caught, you're just actively being out there.
5767553	5771215	Those lost don't reply to you, which is usually what it is.
5772316	5774517	Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
5776218	5779060	Hecht and Chat suggest maybe they were just stealing light switches.
5780325	5787271	I don't think they were Zelda themed light switches or some of the other familiar names you might see on that Reddit.
5790554	5793457	I had the light switch installed so you could turn the lights on and off.
5794017	5795238	Not so you could have a light switch rave.
5796650	5797450	Can't help but think about that.
5797870	5800391	Okay, moving on to one more story.
5800431	5807172	Since we're talking about litigious Nintendo, of course, we have to talk about PAL World, which is getting a pretty big update.
5807392	5810493	Actually, this is interesting because they announced the update this week.
5810533	5812794	And my understanding is that the update did go live.
5813394	5817675	And some people that are really into the game do not like the changes this update made.
5818195	5823676	Some people suspect that this update was trying to change some of the things that Nintendo is trying to litigate.
5824176	5834703	Such as, I guess one thing is that when you spawn your not legally distinct Pokemon, when you spawn your legally distinct Pokemon, you no longer like, I guess, throw a ball.
5834743	5838085	And I don't remember, I played the game for a hot minute when it first, first came out.
5838145	5839926	And then I was like, all right, whatever, I'm done.
5840266	5841167	I moved on to the next thing.
5842087	5848552	So like you don't throw a ball or you don't choose where the legally distinct Pokemon can spawn anymore.
5848652	5850293	They always spawn next to you.
5851033	5874041	and some people are saying that that is to try to get around some sort of thing that Nintendo is suing them basically like you're throwing a Pokeball and the Pokemon comes out they're trying to get around that but people don't like that because you can't strategically place the legally distinct Pokemon anymore so interesting how this is all going down but the new update is also supposed to feature new pals is what they call them
5875031	5880617	Traitors to fight against, bosses, and a high difficulty challenge for fans of the original.
5881417	5897633	So yeah, folks not really a fan of some of these updates that have changed some of the core mechanics, but possibly, we don't know for sure, but possibly to try to change some things ahead of Nintendo coming after them in court.
5898694	5921240	uh also announced uh you know PAL World doesn't exist in a bubble we know Sony has supported them we know they're on Microsoft platforms they're just not on Nintendo platforms they're going to be having a crossover with the game Terraria which I haven't heard about this game in a while but Terraria of course is that game it's like 2D Minecraft I guess is the lazy way to describe it yeah it's like a sandbox 2D sandbox game 2D sandbox game
5921380	5923242	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5945294	5950916	When all is said and done with the Nintendo litigation, the game's not dead.
5951556	5958538	There's still a lot going on, and clearly the game has, even though it's not the... Sorry, I don't know how to turn that off.
5959558	5961559	That is the follow alert for my personal channel.
5961579	5963079	I don't know how to turn it off.
5963860	5964960	But what was I going to say about...
5967162	5968162	That threw me off, dang it.
5968282	5979246	Oh, I was going to say, even though this isn't like the number one broadcasted game on Steam, or I'm sorry, the number one played game on Steam, like it was the week it launched, it's kind of like Pokemon Go.
5979566	5985728	It was gigantic for those first few weeks, and then it kind of fell off, but it's still there, and there's still quite a few people to play it.
5985748	5987649	That's kind of like where Power World is at, ironically.
5988109	5990330	I just compared Power World to Pokemon again.
5991130	5991650	Good job, me.
5992851	5993091	Anyway.
5994420	5998563	All right, that's it for all the slotted stories we had tonight.
5999183	6002666	But we want to encourage you all to participate with our listener roundtable.
6002806	6006749	If you'd like to give us a call, you sure can over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6007149	6009291	You can also send us a message on Blue Sky.
6009431	6010692	We didn't have anything this week.
6011052	6016736	I was trying to promote DarkSakura's little Friday stream, and I asked a question, but nobody responded.
6016776	6020178	I guess people are out of town doing better things on Friday, so whatever.
6020799	6023861	But you can follow us on BlueSky at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6024241	6027483	Yes, your.com can be your handle on Blue Sky.
6027523	6032185	That is still a concept people are getting used to because everybody's like, where's my blue checkmark?
6032285	6034486	And it's, well, no, they did this instead.
6035406	6040389	But people don't understand yet that you can actually have your domain be your Blue Sky name.
6041069	6062941	and that is in case Blue Sky ever goes away or gets bought by a billionaire masquerading as a supervillain you could just move everything via the app protocol which is the backbone that Blue Sky is built on you move everything from that to another service and so that's why essentially like my personal is robroberts.bsky.com
6065557	6068479	Yeah, robroberts.bsky.com or whatever everybody has, right?
6068740	6070481	That's actually just like its own domain.
6071001	6073763	Just like DarkSakura has one, just like Loki has one, it's its own domain.
6074323	6084891	But if I wanted to move it to a Mr. Rob Roberts, you know, whatever I decided to buy.com of my own, or even I could even do a rob.vognetwork.com if I really wanted to.
6085491	6087733	But I also kind of noticed that like,
6088829	6096455	Since people haven't really gotten used to that concept yet, I think it's actually more advantageous to keep the generic .bsky.com, right?
6096555	6100479	Or .bsky.team, whatever it is, to keep that as the default right now.
6102660	6104862	We'll also take your emails, as always.
6104942	6107104	Participate at orangelauntrader.com.
6107324	6109506	I don't think we got any of those either, unless I'm wrong.
6110126	6110326	Nope.
6110767	6111287	I didn't think so.
6112088	6114170	So we take questions from chat, if you'd like.
6115337	6120339	We can go to DJ Ranma S who says, Can we talk about how positive people are on Blue Sky?
6120739	6124501	I was not expecting so many people commenting on my post about my interview.
6125141	6127882	And Mike Deft follows that up saying, Blue Sky is really nice.
6128302	6130303	Hopefully it stays like that for a long while.
6131104	6132604	I'm going to give you my take on this.
6132624	6133404	It's a happy place.
6133504	6134985	I'm going to tell you why this is.
6135545	6141528	That is because a lot of the people on Twitter are actually bots and foreign assets.
6142368	6149958	Um, and this is that, I think this open secret, I think a lot of people know, and I know y'all are going to be like, Rob's got the tinfoil hat on again.
6150098	6153442	No, I, I, I, I think there's a fair amount of confidence.
6153462	6154083	No, it's accurate.
6154103	6158068	That people posting on X, I guess we should call it because Twitter died.
6159170	6159610	Can we call it?
6159670	6159991	Yeah.
6160311	6160531	Yeah.
6161452	6165817	The people posting on X are not quote-unquote real people.
6166138	6169982	They may be real people, but they are paid to have an agenda when they post.
6170062	6172565	Or they are AI, they are bots, they're chat GBT.
6173186	6175709	That segment has- I hate little fuckers on there too.
6176109	6177590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6197256	6224037	community-based moderation tools are very strong and I feel like the real deal breaker for a lot of people when it came to X was the change in blocking was that once it's like you block somebody and it does nothing on X now right essentially they can't reply to you is all it is right so that's what they did over there on Blue Sky when you block somebody they they fucking vanished in the middle they you raptured them the fuck off your internet when you block them
6225049	6250740	you and that's that's both ways you can't go look at their profile anymore any bleats whatever you want to call them skeets whatever I hate that name but whatever you want to call them whatever they try to put like if somebody tries to quote tweet dunk on them and you're that will not push will not show you'll never know that person fucking vaporized in the middle of the night that's what the block button does on blue sky and so what people do they curate these lists
6251440	6254021	Here are all of the robots of Blue Sky.
6254361	6258783	Subscribe to this list and you will automatically block people as they are added to this list.
6259544	6274290	I caution people tremendously from going overboard with that because some people, you know, you have to really trust the person making that list to get it right 100% of the time.
6274791	6279433	Because again, if they get it wrong, that person will be mega blocked for you.
6280453	6289420	I think a mute list may be a safer way to not, because you can still mute people and not vaporize them, essentially, from your internet.
6289881	6293424	You won't see much from them, but you can get it back.
6293724	6294945	You can save that relationship.
6295525	6301190	And a lot of people also don't know, there is a, your blocks on Blue Sky, public.
6302287	6307589	You can go to a website called clearsky.app, put in your handle, and it'll show you exactly who blocked you.
6307929	6308869	It won't tell you why.
6309370	6311610	And the reality, I'm going to tell you that.
6312010	6315932	You're going to go, all of you on Blue Sky are going to go look, and you're going to see that somebody blocked you.
6316452	6319953	And it's probably going to frustrate you because you're going to be like, why did I get blocked?
6320373	6321414	And the reality is...
6321994	6329516	People block for the dumbest shit sometimes, and that's just a fact of life or whatever they had to do to keep their peace.
6329936	6344781	For example, I wrote a thing where I was critical of Chapel Roan's post on TikTok where she was mispronouncing the vice president's name, and I had some personal thoughts on that that I felt was not a good look for her.
6345601	6348322	And I still don't think it was, but that's neither here nor there.
6348602	6350643	Do you know how many Chapel Roan fans blocked me that day?
6351567	6372988	but I don't give a fuck like if that's gonna be a deal breaker for you I'm a pretty awesome person and if you know I offended your delicate sensibilities by just posting what was I believe to be some common sense then bye Felicia I don't care so that's my thing is that if you're gonna go look at your blocks don't get your feelings hurt when you see you've been blocked
6375131	6376472	By the way, I love Chaperone.
6376952	6377893	I love her as an artist.
6377933	6378653	I love her music.
6379113	6382936	But people on the internet don't fucking know nuance anymore.
6383676	6388219	They're not willing to see the deeper side of something, and you just have to kind of get used to that.
6388319	6390401	People are going to block you for whatever reason they feel like.
6392702	6393282	Fair miss.
6393482	6394203	Yeah, exactly.
6394563	6396764	And that's my particular... I'm like, they're missing out.
6397045	6397645	I'm pretty neat.
6398586	6398686	So...
6399656	6404440	Yeah, PodCulture says, wow, that ClearSky's, uh-oh, now I've opened a door to a lot of people.
6404480	6407643	Yeah, you can see exactly who's blocked you, what lists you're on.
6409325	6411307	It'll show you all that stuff is public.
6411327	6412828	Where can you see that?
6412888	6414109	ClearSky.app.
6414249	6414930	Is it .app or .com?
6414990	6415811	Oh, ClearSky.
6416371	6423375	ClearSky, C-L-E-A-R-S-K-Y is the name of that, and you can see all of that.
6423795	6426216	SGO100Matt says, wow, somebody actually blocked me.
6426396	6427617	Probably someone who hates my dog.
6428037	6430258	PodCulture says... That's not even loading up for me.
6431319	6433200	It's been very... Just word of caution.
6433320	6437322	It's obviously a lot of people are slamming that site with Blue Sky's explosive growth.
6437782	6441204	So it has a tendency to go up and down.
6442145	6442305	So...
6444061	6469395	yeah and there are people there you will also find there are people on blue sky that will just try to block as many people as they possibly can so you may have shown up on because somebody's just trying to block you could go to their profile and see who else they've blocked you'll probably see if they've blocked a thousand people whatever it's just you know well no one's blocked me I've blocked a bunch of people
6471471	6473912	Oh no, some people having, they're all assholes.
6475193	6475813	They're missing out.
6475833	6476673	They're missing out.
6477174	6477594	Let's see.
6478814	6482216	DJ Ranma S says, I noticed two people I can't stand have me blocked.
6482396	6482936	I'm glad.
6485277	6488739	It says something a little more explicit and then I can have my peace.
6489559	6491920	Orange Right says, nobody blocked me yet somehow.
6492320	6496862	Orange Right, you post wholesome content of old gaming ads and old video games.
6497163	6498683	How dare anyone block that?
6498983	6500084	How dare anyone block that?
6500684	6527420	I have one person and I don't know who they are but that's all right who cares they're probably somebody who just somebody who hates Minecraft somebody who whenever they see a Minecraft image comes up goes I can't stand this oh my god what's funny is that there's a someone who I actually literally have not thought about that blocked me like I'm still living rent-free in their head that's always kind of fun to see too I had somebody like that oh it's Tay by the way oh
6528855	6537384	anyway I don't know if I can say it Mike Def says if anything you should be on a retro gaming list to Orange Rite a retro gaming list so
6538757	6539017	Anyway.
6539778	6540019	All right.
6540039	6544323	Well, now I guess I've expanded everybody's minds with a new tool they can use, but it's also a good lesson.
6544744	6551091	That stuff, you know, and some people don't like that about Blue Sky and say, I should have a right to my privacy in that regard on who I block.
6552132	6556037	And that's, you know, right now, it's not the protocol that that whole thing was built on.
6556437	6559220	You have to remember, Blue Sky was not
6559861	6560502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6582785	6590152	where the tweets and the posts are decentralized so they live in a place where they cannot be censored.
6590452	6597278	The government cannot come in and tell people what they can and can't say because this exists in a cloud state.
6597358	6601221	It exists on a protocol and it does not belong to any one organization.
6601542	6604985	Blue Sky is simply a lens through which you're looking at app protocol.
6606536	6631655	and so there is that openness to it because it has to be highly portable in that regard so that Blue Sky ever does go down but that doesn't you know again people are just thinking like I just want a Twitter replacement why can't I have pictures and DMs I just want something that replaces Twitter because Blue Sky wasn't actually built to be that but it just turns out that now people realize wow when you take the fucking billionaires out of social media and there's no apps and
6632095	6634898	and all this control over the algorithm is in your hands.
6635278	6638061	Social media is kind of fucking awesome.
6638141	6641223	That's why Blue Sky is expanding as fast as it is right now.
6642545	6645627	Have you noticed you haven't been served any ads on Blue Sky?
6647669	6648270	It's beautiful.
6648390	6648950	It's beautiful.
6650612	6650832	Anyway.
6652438	6657819	Yeah, OrangeRite says, I did follow a retro game starter pack and I got a bunch of follows from that.
6657859	6660579	Yeah, I'm surprised how much the starter pack thing took off.
6660999	6663780	I'm on a Gamer, G-A-Y-M-E-R starter pack.
6663860	6665920	I got a lot of new people from that.
6666240	6668421	So I'm thankful to the folks that put me on that.
6668481	6668881	Thank you.
6669601	6671121	But I was almost a little overwhelmed.
6671141	6675962	Like I'm telling you, in the scope of two days, I had hundreds of new followers because of that starter pack.
6675982	6678422	And I was just surprised that starter packs are that popular.
6678502	6681663	But I guess, you know, when you're coming over from a platform and you don't know...
6682243	6686667	for all the people that are like, I don't get engagement on Blue Sky.
6686747	6688408	No one responds to anything I write.
6688488	6692071	Well, how many people are you following and interacting with?
6692472	6694673	So starter packs do make a good place to start.
6694773	6697255	So let's say it's something like a video game.
6697275	6700418	Let's say we'll take Orange Rite's Retro Game Starter Pack.
6700878	6703861	If you want to talk about retro games on Blue Sky, here's a great place to start.
6703921	6706343	These people are highly likely to talk about retro games with you.
6706963	6707784	And that part's pretty cool.
6708604	6709645	So, anyway.
6709985	6715929	Yeah, QuestBuster says, every time I check into Blue Sky, I'm greeted with cats and food pictures, which is nice.
6716029	6716189	Yes.
6716549	6718290	And you can, there's custom algorithm.
6718310	6723254	I don't know if there's a custom algorithm for nothing but food pictures, but there definitely is one for nothing but cats.
6723754	6733860	I don't know if, you know, there's, there's another slang term for a cat that sometimes is also a slang term for a piece of anatomy.
6733880	6734521	Yeah.
6735967	6740432	I don't know if any of those pictures sneak in there, but I don't think so.
6740472	6744076	I think it's only scanning for cat, kitten, and things like that.
6744136	6747040	Yeah, don't get confused with the other word.
6748021	6749963	But yeah, the custom algorithms are huge.
6750404	6752626	And what's interesting now is that threads...
6753587	6755648	is now... Competition works, y'all.
6755989	6768536	Threads is now looking at... I think Threads implemented custom feeds and Threads is now looking at having a chronological feed be your default feed even though that is against everything Instagram and Facebook want.
6769597	6773919	But the reality is they are losing people to blue sky, hemorrhaging people to blue sky because of it.
6775440	6777762	So if they don't allow people to control your feed...
6778612	6778952	That's it.
6779472	6779812	That's it.
6780373	6783554	FifthDream says, cat pics does have a lot of furries.
6784294	6784614	I see.
6784674	6785975	Yeah, I can see how that happens.
6786155	6788976	You know, people in their cat suits and things like that.
6789056	6789416	Yep, yep.
6789556	6790096	I can see that.
6791977	6793658	I figured out who was the block mate.
6794118	6795138	It was somebody that I blocked.
6795198	6801060	It was on one of those large block lists for... No one lost.
6801581	6802601	Yeah, exactly, right?
6802881	6806382	And they probably went through their list and were like, well, fuck him and fuck him and fuck him.
6807083	6807423	Who cares?
6807443	6808103	Who cares?
6809039	6811880	Alright, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
6813081	6813481	Yeah, I do.
6814242	6821585	So real quick, apparently Crackdown 1 and 2 are free on Xbox Live in case you never did redeem them.
6822146	6822766	Oh, I didn't know that.
6822826	6823226	That's cool.
6824067	6829009	So go redeem those now to your account if you don't have them already.
6829369	6832171	But I mean, they are pretty old because they're from the Xbox 360.
6832691	6833231	One was good.
6833692	6835232	Two was alright.
6835753	6838134	Three is not as great.
6838953	6840555	but the first one was good.
6840975	6842097	Yeah, the first couple games were great.
6843859	6844219	Love that.
6844640	6845340	Love a free game.
6847162	6847983	Anything else?
6850046	6850606	Anything else, Loki?
6850626	6851167	That's all I had.
6852540	6855301	Well, I guess with that then, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.
6855602	6860284	Not a bad, I mean, a little shorter of a show, but not that short considering it was holiday week and all.
6860344	6862005	I hope you all had a great holiday week, by the way.
6862505	6864286	I'm sorry most of you are going back to work tomorrow.
6864426	6866267	I am too, but we'll get through it together.
6866687	6869548	And we're just a few weeks away from the other holiday season.
6869668	6872410	So we'll be coming up on the new year before you know it.
6873030	6899129	so with that uh thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting us we appreciate it if you enjoyed what you heard here on Orange Lounge Radio please help us spread the word tell a friend or two uh we are the show where every gamer has a voice we need more voices to put out on air so nice five-star review on iTunes goes an awful long way Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show uh really appreciate that um and uh yeah appreciate uh all your kind words the people that join the discord and all that good stuff um

6903852	6904753	Yeah, I'm going to do Polya.
6905273	6905673	Oh, okay.
6905693	6906154	That'll be fun.
6907174	6914199	Yeah, I've decided that I'm going to limit my Dead by Daylight to just two days a week just so I can keep a few more positive and chill vibes around.
6916120	6920043	I mean, I still enjoy playing it, but I don't know.
6921284	6922965	It needs to have a little bit of a break for right now.
6922985	6928589	So I'm going to play Polya tonight, and I just want to hang around and just have people hang out and chat about stuff we talked about on the show.
6929574	6931235	Variety is good, so enjoy.
6931376	6931876	Have a good stream.
6932216	6940583	But I had to mute for a moment because I literally did laugh my ass off over living rent-free and that fucker's head.
6941464	6942845	Alright, have a good stream.
6943266	6943666	Enjoy.
6943806	6945447	I am spiteful and I love it.
6945728	6945988	I know.
6946188	6947169	Alright, have a good one.
6948010	6948670	Later, taters.
6949050	6949391	Peace.
6950131	6952533	Alright, Loki, we're gonna go to you to do your final thought.
6954155	6957858	My final thought is still gonna be working hard on Minecraft stuff this week.
6959153	6960073	And I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
6960153	6960674	Keep at it.
6960734	6961234	Keep at it.
6962214	6966375	My final thought is I can't believe it's already December and the end of the year is almost here.
6966695	6969496	And it's been a heck of an interesting year.
6969736	6970537	Lots of good stuff.
6970637	6972437	Not everything's been great, but lots of good stuff.
6973658	6976378	And here's to 2025 on the horizon.
6976979	6980320	I'll leave you with something real, a real piece of advice here.
6980940	6983861	Don't wait until New Year's Day
6984801	6985581	to do something.
6986081	6989482	If you want to make a change in your life, you want to start doing something, do it now.
6989963	6990383	Do it now.
6990523	6992163	January 1st is just today.
6992683	6993544	It's just another day.
6994544	7001206	As that song goes, since DarkSakura brought up rent, I'll say a line from the musical, which I actually don't like.
7001846	7002667	The musical rent.
7002927	7005047	But there is a quote from there that always sticks with me.
7005748	7006628	No day but today.
7007088	7009029	So make those changes you want to make today.
7009549	7009789	All right.
7009889	7010649	Have a good one, everybody.
7010669	7012530	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
