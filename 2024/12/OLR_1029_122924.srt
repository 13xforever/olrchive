1
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:15,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote Sega President Shuji Utsumi regarding another Sega mini-console, I'm not going for the mini-direction.

2
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:15,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not me.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to embrace modern games.

4
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:18,597
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not a retro company.

5
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:24,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I get why he said this, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to laugh the next time a Sonic, Sega, or other classic gamer collection hits the game stores.

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Do remasters count as retro games?

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,460
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Past is Greater in Your Mind intro.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you one more sentence in this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

9
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

10
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

11
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:01:00,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again on this merry happy week, December 29th, 2024 with episode number 1029 of our show.

13
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:04,331
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts and I am here joined by my co-hosts.

14
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:09,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Hanukkah.

16
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:10,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello.

17
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:11,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Hanukkah to you.

18
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:17,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the shirt your VTuber is wearing tonight saying, feed me Lakas and tell me I'm pretty.

19
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:18,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

20
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:19,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

21
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:21,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Just feed me Lakas, really.

22
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,592
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it comes through on OLR stream, I know yours is mirrored.

23
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on OLR, probably because of Discord integration and all that.

24
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But I assure you that's what it says.

25
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had to do some shenanigans.

26
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:39,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm looking at Discord right now, and it's the correct direction.

27
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:40,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

28
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:41,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

29
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:46,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I can probably flip your screen or something in Discord, but I just... Discord should be reversed.

30
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:47,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello, Tech Master Loki.

31
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:53,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I had to reverse it coming out of my thing.

32
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:54,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

33
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever my thing is.

34
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:56,426
[SPEAKER_05]: OBS.

35
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:57,807
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,250
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

37
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:42,578
[SPEAKER_06]: He pre-ordered that for my birthday, and we didn't think they were coming until early 2025, but it actually showed up somewhere around Thanksgiving when he was sick, then I was sick, then I went to Memphis.

38
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So finally, we got the shelving built, and it's all set up.

39
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say, this thing is super cute, this Evercade Alpha that plays.

40
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:56,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It has the Capcom games built into it, so it has Mega Man, Power Battle, Mega Man Power Battle 2, Striders in it, which is pretty rad.

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's one of Jamie's favorites, and Final Fight.

42
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,462
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a console more type of thing.

44
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:38,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the Namco 1 and 2 cartridges and they don't play on the Versys because they say, oh, these are not licensed for this, which I kind of think is pretty bullshit.

45
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:43,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess they are the only cartridges in the Evercade system that don't do that.

46
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:47,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do feel that's really bullshit.

47
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand it's probably out of Evercade's control.

48
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,280
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:37,806
[SPEAKER_06]: so right now I have my Namco cartridges plugged in there and the other night I was playing Dragon Spirit although I was a little I was like oh it's not the Dragon Spirit arcade version it's the Dragon Spirit NES port which wasn't quite the same it's not bad but it's I was like oh it's a little different so yeah so that's my that's my Capcom Namco cabinet right now that's that's joining me in the office but it's I'm now officially out of room although

50
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, you could probably appreciate this.

51
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what Alan's talking about doing?

52
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what Alan wants to do?

53
00:04:45,318 --> 00:05:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: he wants to just get rid of the kitchen which is or the I should say the dining room not the kitchen sorry the kitchen table in the dining room um because uh we don't we know what's in my dining room right pinball machines I know that's why I'm saying you know not to add not to you know what I'm gonna say yeah now I have well he said he said if we get rid of the dining table in the day because we don't use it we're it's just the two of us we don't sit down for fancy dining

54
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:34,384
[SPEAKER_06]: we you know if anything um we're gonna use uh you know the living room or something and so it's just this is how we are right we're that kind of family it's us and the cats so he's like if we get rid of that we can put more machines down there and I was like oh boy I was like just what we need I'm like don't tell Jamie because she'll try she'll try to store a pinball machine here

55
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:40,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have plenty to lend out.

56
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you like to hold on to a Doctor Who for a hot minute?

57
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, pod culture would find my house and burn it down.

58
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:48,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Not with my pinball in it.

59
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:50,788
[SPEAKER_06]: He'd take it out first.

60
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cats, to be fair.

61
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,511
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

62
00:05:55,612 --> 00:06:03,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, go into our chat room because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vognetwork.com.

63
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:27,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific Again at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Bobby Blackwolf sadly not on tonight as well He kind of ran into the reverse situation that I had a couple weeks ago So he doesn't like to announce when he goes on a trip But now that he's back, he was on a trip, that's where he was last week And unfortunately he got sick after the trip

64
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:30,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas with me, I got sick and then I went on a trip.

65
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:34,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's, I guess, just the VOG Network way right now.

66
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,609
[SPEAKER_06]: But feel better soon, Bobby Blackwolf.

67
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,750
[SPEAKER_06]: My understanding is he is doing better today.

68
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But just the voice is kind of the last thing to recover.

69
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:46,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And talking for an hour was not a good idea.

70
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:47,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can respect that.

71
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:52,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll look forward to Bobby's return next week here at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

72
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:53,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

73
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:56,579
[SPEAKER_06]: PodCulture says, hell no, I'd set the high score.

74
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:00,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that would be fair revenge for speaking of Bobby Blackwolf.

75
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:03,483
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be some fair revenge to things that I've done.

76
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:05,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

77
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:11,729
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people I really truly do not believe are going to beat some of the high scores at my house.

78
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:14,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do the high scores reset when you unplug it?

79
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:17,593
[SPEAKER_06]: When you unplug it and plug it back in, does the high score reset?

80
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is there memory that it saves to?

81
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have to manually do it.

82
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:21,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

83
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:22,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

84
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, well then, yeah, you probably wouldn't beat those scores unless it reset when you moved it.

85
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:29,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

86
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:41,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Darted Sia says, if I had the funds, I'd be tempted to look into one of those at games or one up pinball machines, but we have pinball FX on the PS five of the interim, you know, speaking of Bobby and he's talked about this on his show.

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, I want to say he did a little video tour at some point in the past.

88
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:53,307
[SPEAKER_06]: He has some really nice, like, multi-cade machines that he bought from a local Atlantic company that I know always shows at Southern Fried Game Expo.

89
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,508
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, of course, at the moment, I don't remember the name of the company.

90
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:55,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

91
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know the machines are nice.

92
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has one that is like a multi-arcade machine.

93
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he has another that's pinball.

94
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:05,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like virtual pinball with the table laid down.

95
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I understand, you know, virtual pinball is kind of its own.

96
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:10,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But for what it is, it's very nice.

97
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:12,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be tempted to get one of those machines, but I actually am not sure that there's still enough room.

99
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a California house, people.

100
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:22,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty small.

101
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:24,907
[SPEAKER_06]: A little townhouse.

102
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:30,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Someday we'll move, and then I will have my dedicated game room and look out.

103
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:32,816
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

104
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:57,623
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, where do guests eat when you have house parties when there is no tables?

105
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:58,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad, so sad.

106
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:01,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Around here we eat with our hands like Americans.

107
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:19,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to say, I don't, I can't, I can't think of the last time I went to a dinner party where everybody sat around the table and ate that wasn't A, Thanksgiving, which, you know, okay, that makes sense, or B, at a restaurant.

108
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:45,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of the last time I was at a party where everybody sat down to eat like that maybe I'm just hanging with a weird crowd I don't know but I don't think so I like my peeps so that's that all right um I want to start hosting tea parties like actual tea parties that'd be fun yeah why not what kind of tea you gonna serve all the tea it'll be the hot tea hot tea the piping hot kind

109
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:50,282
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100 Matt says, ain't no dinner party better than a home arcade party.

110
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but no kids.

111
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:54,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to say.

112
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe over a certain age.

113
00:09:56,884 --> 00:10:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'd have to vet them child by child to make sure that.

114
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,130
[SPEAKER_06]: They know how to behave around arcade machines.

115
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,293
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be my one thing.

116
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:13,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, Loki's kids at this point are old enough.

117
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:14,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they would wreck a machine.

118
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, some kids don't know the difference yet.

119
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:19,284
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they wouldn't.

120
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:20,765
[SPEAKER_08]: They also probably wouldn't be interested.

121
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:22,187
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair.

122
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:22,968
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair, too.

123
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade Machines, that's Dad's thing, yeah.

124
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:39,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they would probably play some, like if we had a racing cabinet or the Jurassic Park game, they'd probably play it for a little bit, but then they'd get bored pretty quick.

125
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:41,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, it's hard to say.

126
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:45,286
[SPEAKER_08]: My oldest son, yes, would probably get bored of it.

127
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:50,288
[SPEAKER_08]: My youngest, though, he's going on these phases where he's trying to...

128
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Questmaster by Apogee

129
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, I didn't realize Apogee was still publishing games.

130
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Did somebody else buy the name or what's the deal there?

131
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:26,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

132
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:27,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but that's cool.

133
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:35,140
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is essentially a legally distinct Link to the Past maker.

134
00:11:36,394 --> 00:12:02,789
[SPEAKER_06]: it well you know you get those ZZT vibes a little bit but just with maybe some link to the past inspired graphics or you know that whole thing so yeah it's definitely legally distinct sort of thing but it's got a story and it's got a bunch of user made levels now and they're going to be supposedly coming out of early access this year at some point I have it installing to my Steam Deck as we speak

135
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:11,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see, uh, yeah, DarkTipsTV in chat says, yeah, I was going to say it looks like a Zelda maker, but not copyright infringing.

136
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:17,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on the kids and, uh, video games, uh, S200 Matt says, kids will come over and ask where the tickets are.

137
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,813
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I, I honestly would think kids would look at these games and go, these are old.

138
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:22,673
[SPEAKER_06]: These are boring.

139
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:26,475
[SPEAKER_06]: These are, you know, what's, this is it, you know, type of thing.

140
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:30,597
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have that same sentimental attachment to some of these games that...

141
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:59,810
[SPEAKER_08]: it depends, like at the arcade they obviously will want to play ticket games because they're looking to win prizes because that's their goals, they're not there to play games they're there to see what they can win in the prize thing yeah, and that's kind of a little different but yeah, they'll play like racing games and stuff, or they'll play probably not like shooter games or anything, but they'll play games just for the fun of it it's just I think given like

142
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:23,657
[SPEAKER_08]: they play a lot of Roblox stuff and then like I don't know they're all like kind of into their own things like my oldest son's in the Helldivers 2 like a lot he's played it a ton he's played through Red Dead Redemption 2 like several times already and you know now my oldest son's upset he was obsessed with Zelda stuff and now he's obsessed with Mario Kart now

143
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:52,432
[SPEAKER_08]: so it's just that goes in phases but yeah and also my oldest son right now on his computer has AFK like this game called Fish on Roblox which is like some big popular thing now so he's playing that the thing I always see on Roblox is the fashion review yeah yeah there's that and now there's a ballroom simulator thing the old voguing ballroom Paris is Burning type of stuff which I think is it's no ex tango

144
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:54,563
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's no Xtango.

145
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:55,044
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

146
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,446
[SPEAKER_06]: We should probably get into our kickoff topic.

147
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about what is going on in gaming.

148
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:01,651
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about more things that we've been playing this week in just a little bit.

149
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, let's talk about what is going on in the news.

150
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:08,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, with the holidays, it is a slower news period.

151
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:15,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are some things going on, including what some sneaky Grinch is trying to do things in a week that nobody's paying attention.

152
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Loki?

153
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:21,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, it's total Warner Brothers coming at it.

154
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:24,616
[SPEAKER_08]: What's Warner Brothers popular for nowadays?

155
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:25,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

156
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:31,462
[SPEAKER_08]: We're moving things from being viewed for tax purposes, most likely.

157
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:41,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now they are delisting a bunch of Cartoon Network games off of Steam and the Nintendo eShop.

158
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:49,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're delisting Adventure Time, there's several Adventure Time games, OK KO Games, Steven Universe, all that stuff.

159
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:51,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're also...

160
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:57,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Removing, I guess, Samurai Jack Battle Through Time has been removed from sale as well.

161
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:04,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it says no longer, they will be no longer available for sale after December 23rd.

162
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Signed Cartoon Network Games or Adult Swim Games.

163
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:11,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I hate Zaslav.

164
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:15,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and anybody that cares about game preservation has a cry.

165
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:17,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's just...

166
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:22,805
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't be this way where they can write these things off in the first place.

167
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:24,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I strongly feel that sort of thing.

168
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:25,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've said this before.

169
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:30,149
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do use these things as a tax write-off, then those things belong to the public now.

170
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,191
[SPEAKER_06]: You've released those things into the public domain.

171
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,112
[SPEAKER_06]: That is how I strongly believe this should work.

172
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that if you are going to tax write-off something like Acme vs. Coyote or whatever that movie was or Batgirl, then those things should belong to the public domain.

173
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:47,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Then anybody should be able to broadcast those movies and...

174
00:15:47,921 --> 00:16:01,341
[SPEAKER_06]: have them because you essentially you're writing it off for public money you should have to release it in the public domain and I think it would make companies think twice about this kind of thing maybe they wouldn't give a shit I don't know but at least we wouldn't lose these games forever

175
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,374
[SPEAKER_06]: because people worked hard on these.

176
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:06,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, were they the most popular games, top-selling games?

177
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:09,119
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but someday somebody's going to want to play it.

178
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:24,872
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be looking into Cartoon Network series and the different spinoffs that have come from it and want to play these games, and they will not be able to without turning to piracy, which these actions literally drive us towards.

179
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:26,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

180
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:27,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

181
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:42,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then, you know, because obviously Warner Brothers really is concerned about copyright when it comes to their IP, they had an update or a promotion for a new skin for their... I don't even know what this character is.

182
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:46,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the original characters in Multiverses.

183
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Some weird, like, dog thing with...

184
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:53,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Antlers, not really sure what it is, but they had a skin that made it a rain dog.

185
00:16:55,647 --> 00:17:07,176
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a skin that turned it into a unicorn, and so instead of coming up with a unique advertising campaign, they decided to just go ahead and completely rip off Charlie the Unicorn.

186
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:17,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So not only is the skin called Charlie, but they also stole the audio from Charlie the Unicorn in their promotion video that appeared on Twitter.

187
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:18,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

188
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:48,458
[SPEAKER_08]: you know of course oddly enough funny I was watching stuff from FilmCow this week because I was like hey I wonder what's up with FilmCow completely independently of all this and funny enough Jason Steele the head of I think the sole person of FilmCow is made a comment regarding Multiverses is a game by Warner Brothers a company with an annual revenue of $40 billion here they are using my work without permission to advertise their game

189
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,347
[SPEAKER_08]: and they essentially used his voice.

190
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,916
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they blatantly stole the audio.

191
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,033
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking stupid.

192
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:04,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Warner Brothers, of course, I mean, fair is fair, right?

193
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:08,459
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they use their audio, we can use their audio, right?

194
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, of course not, because they've also taken down fan works that have used stuff from that as well.

195
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:18,626
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of hypocritical.

196
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:24,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The tweet in question with that advertising video has been deleted by Warner Brothers.

197
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:32,775
[SPEAKER_08]: but of course the internet is the internet so they have archived it and yeah it's

198
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty bad.

199
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:39,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Why particularly were they trying to add Charlie the Unicorn?

200
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: My brain goes to, was it like a Robot Unicorn Attack reference?

201
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:48,221
[SPEAKER_06]: But then if that's the case, you would do the Erasure Song or whatever.

202
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,923
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably too cheap to license again.

203
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you would do something in that realm.

204
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Robot Unicorn Attack was a Cartoon Network thing, right?

205
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:58,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore it is under WB, could be part of Multiverses.

206
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could see if it's kind of going that way, but...

207
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:05,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are they so hell-bent on stealing Charlie the Unicorn when it's not even theirs?

208
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:31,293
[SPEAKER_08]: because they couldn't come up with anything unique they just literally pointed out a unique unicorn that is within their they could have had well they wanted to do this some artist or whatever that worked with them you know essentially did it so yeah the video has been uh like i said it has been taken down but there is it has been someone managed to grab it before it was deleted once on the internet always forever right so they had that but yeah it's it's just

209
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:49,424
[SPEAKER_08]: it's really dumb like it's just it's completely devoid and like even the video itself is not really transformative they basically steal the audio and it's just their character kind of doing an emote and just standing there while the camera pans between three identical things it's just it's bad

210
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:57,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're looking at this here live on Twitch as we're broadcasting and it looks like... I gotta say, I will give it this.

211
00:19:57,976 --> 00:20:01,220
[SPEAKER_06]: When I look at this, I don't think Charlie the Unicorn.

212
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,527
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of doesn't look like the old animation whatsoever, to be honest.

213
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like just a unicorn.

214
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:13,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they're using the audio, then that's...

215
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:18,095
[SPEAKER_06]: much different on, I wonder, yeah, I wonder what the thought process was in that.

216
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:22,937
[SPEAKER_06]: That just looks like, honestly, that looks like a dog with a party hat.

217
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, kind of, yeah.

218
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a dog with a party hat.

219
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:38,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, he's come out, like, Jason Steele's come out and said, like, he gave examples of other games kind of using the Charlie the Unicorn stuff for, like, you know, more fair use.

220
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:42,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there's a unicorn, I guess, in World of Warcraft that has an enchanted kidney.

221
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:45,628
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a dead unicorn that has an enchanted kidney or something like that.

222
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:49,071
[SPEAKER_08]: That, you know, is obviously in reference to that.

223
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:51,833
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not like straight up stealing his audio.

224
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:54,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And World of Warcraft has all sorts of like things that toe the line.

225
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Harris-Pilton was a big meme that sold like a 10,000 gold bag.

226
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:00,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dora Moorhead.

227
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's all sorts of little...

228
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:29,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Warcrafty things that they do that toe the line but yeah they are all they are all well within the lines of parody right so interesting um you know looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network OrangeRite says the intern probably thought it was just a meme and memes are free to use for reasons uh and looks like a Rindog birthday cake yeah that's I OrangeRite I honestly think

229
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,130
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 Wife, 90 Kids

230
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:01,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, I didn't... You know, he got some... He bought a house with what he got.

231
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:01,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

232
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:04,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm thinking success stories, too, a little more recently.

233
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: What's her name?

234
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:07,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Jules the... Very demure.

235
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:08,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Very mindful.

236
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:10,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cutesy.

237
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, she...

238
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:14,139
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

239
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:47,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the, the, the one, the, the girl, the scary girlfriend, the one in the picture like this, this is like, oh, and she was like, yeah, like it's made my dating life, you know, like I, at some point it will come up that that was me in the picture and people think that it's legit, like that whole kind of thing.

240
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:51,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's like, does somebody like her make money off a picture like that?

241
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe the occasional talk show appearance.

242
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,881
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're really smart from the get go, you print a shirt.

243
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:08,090
[SPEAKER_06]: You print, you know, you take a saying and you get it on a shirt, which is probably what I'm assuming what Jules did with the Demir and Mindful thing, because I remember there's a whole issue with the trademark and that, right?

244
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:16,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So she gets, I think she finally wrestled away the trademark for very Demir, very Mindful, and now, you know, makes money with that on products and all that stuff.

245
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of these people that become these meme stars, they kind of belong to the internet, which is really weird.

246
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:28,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I mean, you know, hey, it sucks that they can't make that money off of their meme stardom.

247
00:23:28,126 --> 00:23:32,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how else are they going to be able to do a crypto rug pull if they're not famous from these memes?

248
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:39,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So... I feel unfortunate for them that they're unable to exploit their fans yet.

249
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:49,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you have people that, like, try too hard to make the money off the memes, like Hak'tu, that whole thing, which I... I'm going to go to sleep now for, like, three weeks.

250
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:50,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

251
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:50,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

252
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:52,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You got me, bitch.

253
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:53,124
[SPEAKER_06]: You got me.

254
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:22,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's unfortunate that these games are being unlisted and we sit here helpless and watching it.

255
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:24,262
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we do about it?

256
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Pirate them, I guess, is really all we can do to keep these games alive.

257
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Physical copies.

258
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:32,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, physical copies and don't support games, I guess, that are always online.

259
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:33,729
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, stuff like that.

260
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:38,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, yeah, at least with the physical copies of some of these games, you'd be able to still play them.

261
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:44,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Although nowadays, like even if you go to the store and buy a physical copy of the game, it's like, oh, here's a download code.

262
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:44,717
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like...

263
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:46,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thanks.

264
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:58,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there some game sales report recently that like, if you look at PC game sales, 1% of PC game sales is over the counter.

265
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,624
[SPEAKER_06]: 99% is digital because of things like Steam and Epic.

266
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:03,125
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, when you look at PC games, I mean...

267
00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:05,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that tracks, right?

268
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:18,690
[SPEAKER_06]: That 1% is probably that one shelf at Target that I don't even know if it exists anymore that has like the Agatha Christie, Bejeweled 70, Nancy Drew games.

269
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just this very strange hod podge of games.

270
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:26,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Games for grandma and grandkids.

271
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:27,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I...

272
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:56,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to knock those games some people love their Nancy Drew but you know like that's the only stuff that seems to sell physical like obviously everything else is online yeah I mean I've seen that shelf it's like now a shelf at all I don't even know if that exists anymore most of it's like just even if you want a physical game it's all cards nowadays and even it's funny like if you go into the game section like I go to Target every week

273
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:26,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Killing Time while my son's at his programming class and you look at what they've got on the shelves there's not really a lot of physical copies anywhere they don't really keep a lot of that but they do keep a lot of download cards which is another option and I mean to be honest like I was always kind of against non-physical stuff originally but I was very okay with it on PC and I mean to the most part I am still okay with that because I have a huge Steam library unfortunately just still growing by the day and

274
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just never going to play all those games.

275
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:30,683
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

276
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine because maybe I will someday.

277
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:34,046
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

278
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,647
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't matter.

279
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:40,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, that person, that developer got paid because I thought their game was cool enough to purchase.

280
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:44,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether I play it or not, yeah, I mean, that kind of sucks, but that's beyond the point.

281
00:26:46,670 --> 00:27:01,521
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah, it's I trust those indie game developers a hundred times more than I would trust Cartoon Network or Warner Brothers games, like please like I would never trust that if I had the choice between spending $20 on an indie game or $20 on a Warner Brothers game

282
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:11,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to buy the indie game because I know that at least that's going to work for as long as that person is physically able to support that game.

283
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Warner Bros.

284
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,172
[SPEAKER_08]: is like, oh, well, let's just get rid of it.

285
00:27:14,192 --> 00:27:15,673
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll write it off as a tax thing.

286
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:16,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm sorry.

287
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:18,356
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just the...

288
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:25,312
[SPEAKER_08]: This is essentially what a lot of this private equity stuff happens.

289
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:33,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, any time you hear about a company that's just being, like, stripped of everything, Toys R Us, and just shut down because of private equities...

290
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Party City, yeah, Private Equity.

291
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:49,446
[SPEAKER_08]: They buy it up, strip it out, like they're selling off organs on the black market, and then they sell it off and close it down, and everybody loses their jobs and stuff like that.

292
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:53,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And granted, Party City wasn't super popular.

293
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:53,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

294
00:27:55,169 --> 00:28:19,420
[SPEAKER_06]: it was, it served its purpose it was the only option for like costumes year round because spirit stores aren't exactly open year round although I guess now spirit is testing a thing where it changes from Halloween to Christmas at some point and it's like they're doing like a spirit or maybe just holiday or whatever they call it like they're doing like a holiday type of store now

295
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

296
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:23,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just sell it online.

297
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Sell costumes online.

298
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:26,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not sell those all the year?

299
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:31,505
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other option now is Amazon.

300
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:38,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hate seeing everything in the world folding into Amazon.

301
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:39,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting kind of scary.

302
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of been scary for a little bit, but it's getting worse.

303
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:46,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And like to see Party, yeah, Party City was some niche shit, okay?

304
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:50,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was that kind of niche shit when it's like when you need it, you need it, right?

305
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always had, and Jamie, you'll remember this.

306
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:57,336
[SPEAKER_06]: We always had that place that was superior to Party City for a long time.

307
00:28:57,356 --> 00:28:58,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember Wishing Well?

308
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:20,665
[SPEAKER_06]: yes yeah yeah that store was the fucking bomb but then that was the first to go was the independent party stores were the first to go and then Party City still kind of hung on because it was very corporate and then um now they're gone too and I feel like all right well if you're preparing for a party and you have a need for you know green party hats or something like you know like like it

309
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:49,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Ingress stuff is always green versus blue it's very easy to find a lot of blue party shit and a lot of green party shit at Party City all the time but now it's like they did and it actually works out really well so much cosplay stuff there too so it's a bummer I'm not happy to see it but it's like one of those things like sure I can buy all that same shit on Amazon but I just don't love that it's like yet another Amazon thing

310
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:54,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the entire world is being sold through Amazon.

311
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:55,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little crazy.

312
00:29:56,223 --> 00:30:00,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, because Amazon's there to get... I mean, it's like Walmart or Target.

313
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:01,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, more so Walmart, I think.

314
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:03,204
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, you know, they come in.

315
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:03,905
[SPEAKER_08]: They're huge.

316
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,745
[SPEAKER_08]: They put all the independents out of business, and they raise their prices.

317
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:08,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with Amazon.

318
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:15,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon, in the sense, they're going to keep selling, like, cheap knockoff Chinese crap, but they're also going to...

319
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:16,748
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

320
00:30:41,018 --> 00:30:42,759
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the stuff that Bezos does.

321
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:50,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I was reminded though on the party front and the costume front that at least here locally where we're based in Sacramento, we do still have Evangeline's.

322
00:30:50,705 --> 00:30:53,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had forgotten that they do run the costume mansion year round now.

323
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:54,408
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't always.

324
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:55,789
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be only during the Halloween season.

325
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:56,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Evangeline's.

326
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love Evangeline's too.

327
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:07,397
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever visit Sacramento in Old Town, Evangeline's is absolutely one of the top three very Sacramento things I would urge you to visit.

328
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Evangeline's is fucking rad.

329
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:09,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

330
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:23,517
[SPEAKER_06]: but I mean Evangelion is really good for costumes they don't have quite the same amount of party supplies I mean they have some but you know but um yeah at least they have that locally which is nice but not every town's gonna have something like that this is a bummer

331
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to address something else you said, though, Loki, since it is a slower news week.

332
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,233
[SPEAKER_06]: We have room for more tangents tonight.

333
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:35,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to bring up, you mentioned at Target you see that the trading card stuff is kind of exploding.

334
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:40,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I think is the smartest fucking game that was released all year?

335
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:42,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying the best.

336
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying the smartest game they released all year.

337
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:49,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That Pokemon trading card pocket game.

338
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Brilliant.

339
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:58,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever thought of that game, that is like the million dollar idea because you know what that game is?

340
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:10,122
[SPEAKER_06]: They really put the focus, instead of like trying to recreate the Pokemon trading card experience one for one, they put all of the focus on collecting cards, showing them off.

341
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:19,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we have a scaled down version of the game over here too, so it's notably different from the trading card game, but kind of gets you your first taste of it.

342
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:36,923
[SPEAKER_06]: and I can't tell you how many people I've seen on social media that have dug up their old Pokemon cards or went to the store and bought Pokemon cards for old time's sake or suddenly have a renewed interest in the Pokemon physical trading card game because of what they've done with the mobile game.

343
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild.

344
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:42,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I will fully admit, I play the mobile game.

345
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not bought the physical cards before

346
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:50,486
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not saying I would never, ever buy the physical cards.

347
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are really cute, cool looking.

348
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:57,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I just think that's like the smartest thing that they've done.

349
00:32:58,328 --> 00:33:03,450
[SPEAKER_06]: S2HunterMatt in chat says, Rob talks about this just as I pull up my game to open my free pack, right?

350
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,433
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura says, I kind of fell off Pokemon trading card game, but then my phone has been acting weird lately, so it just might be me.

351
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:15,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hopefully your phone... You could always try a reset on your phone or something.

352
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:15,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

353
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to give that kind of advice on air.

354
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:20,358
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I hope you're able to get it to work again.

355
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,280
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just think that's... Because that game...

356
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:29,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hard time believing that game was not released without another agenda in mind.

357
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And that agenda was bringing awareness to the physical trading card game.

358
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:36,747
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of people love Pokemon.

359
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:38,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an easy thing to get people into.

360
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:42,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I just want to bring that up.

361
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's why the trading card stuff is expanding, Loki.

362
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more Pokemon cards.

363
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:47,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But not that that's the only way.

364
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:51,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like Magic is as popular as it's ever been.

365
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:54,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking Magic the Gathering has been around since I was in high school.

366
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:56,114
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a very long time ago at this point.

367
00:33:56,454 --> 00:34:14,561
[SPEAKER_08]: when I was talking about cards it wasn't necessarily trading cards they do have a huge section over by the cash registers for trading cards but I was talking about like the digital download codes for games but yeah no they do still I thought you were talking about the aisle by the register that has been there for a long it's still there right yeah

368
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:32,770
[SPEAKER_08]: it's still there, yeah, they have a lot of stuff with all that, the trading card stuff and yeah, with the Pokemon trading card the digital game, at the very least there it's also something you can get into it without having to worry about people snatching up all the cards and stuff in real life, although I don't I think that's probably cooled down a bit, I haven't heard

369
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:54,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't followed the scene closely enough to and even when I hear about Pokemon from Shane or somebody else I know that's into Pokemon it's usually the trading card game is the one where it's like I love Pokemon but I don't really do the trading card game yet now that this is out it's like well okay now maybe I'm doing it a little bit

370
00:34:55,357 --> 00:35:23,237
[SPEAKER_06]: but even I've I've been playing the pocket game I because I like that the focus is just on kind of the collecting and like any battle I don't do I just don't do the player versus player battles it's very easy to not play them do I miss out on some cosmetic rewards yes do I care no and then as far as the PVE goes you can just let the you just hit auto battle and I let my little phone just sit here while auto battles while I'm doing something else and check it oh did I win did I lose okay go again or whatever I want to do it's great

371
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:28,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I just, I think they really, whoever put that together, very, very smart idea.

372
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:37,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Deft in chat says, granted, the Pokemon card boom went off during pandemic times, but TCG Pocket definitely reignited it.

373
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:44,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, it's weird to think about, but the pandemic being new was five years ago.

374
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:45,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

375
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:50,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while since the days of Animal Crossing and all of that.

376
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:59,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Def says, that's cooled off, but that's also because Pokemon Company has done better in fulfilling stock and even making cards more readily available.

377
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:02,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was that whole stuff about the museum card and all that stuff, right?

378
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:31,003
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100Matt says Pokemon trading card game YouTube channels do very well people have been pulling high view counts just making videos opening card packs I'm talking the actual card game not the pocket game shit you could probably make videos for the pocket game too and it would do a respectful number so yeah that doesn't surprise me at all that whole like blind pack opening thing no matter what game you're playing I feel like is always big numbers on YouTube

379
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:33,860
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

380
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:58,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, I have to thank my co-hosts on this series for my gifts.

381
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Loki, for Bomb Rush Cyberpunk.

382
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:05,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I always say the name wrong.

383
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is available on GeForce.

384
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:08,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play it.

385
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:17,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, thank you for Digimon World and Rocky Horror Show and the ghost one that I never remember the name of either.

386
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:18,260
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

387
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do have a bunch of PC games on there, but I find ways to play them.

388
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine the Rocky Horror Games a very heavy-duty game.

389
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It ought to be able to run on one of those.

390
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Whiskey could run Project T with no problem.

391
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

392
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:50,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in beta, so...

393
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll load dead by daylight, but the stupid anti-cheat blocks it, so whatever it is.

394
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:05,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But I beat Dragon Age The Veil Guard, and I'm on my second playthrough.

395
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:18,265
[SPEAKER_05]: This playthrough is me doing most of the opposite decisions that I did from the last one, except for a few things, because there's morality things that I wouldn't vote differently.

396
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:19,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

397
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:32,667
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh I played some Dead by Daylight working on finishing out um the all the challenges that there are to do I'm gonna play a little bit tonight since I don't have work tomorrow um

398
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:38,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Fruit Mountain, which I'm kind of addicted to.

399
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:48,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a 3D version of the Suica game, where you rotate this platter around and have to stack and merge fruit and stuff.

400
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of like my mindless game, you know, my clicker.

401
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:54,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Requires a little bit of thought, but not a lot of thought.

402
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:55,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

403
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:18,182
[SPEAKER_05]: that's that's really really been it um we're doing a lot of downsizing in the house and um well if anyone's got a couple grand to have a couple of Final Fight games I could sell you well Mighty Final Fight and uh Final Fight Guy yeah those games are quite rare quite rare

404
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:20,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are.

405
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:26,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've gone through and just tried to compile some things like the Atari games were kind of all over the place.

406
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:28,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got a gift.

407
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:37,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I'm going to take a bit of a tangent aside on this one and bear with me because this is me gamifying something.

408
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:45,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am in the middle of creating myself a leveling up system to level up my ballet practice.

409
00:39:47,448 --> 00:40:07,855
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm gonna be setting like experience points for myself for doing like my stretches or for making levels and like every time I hit like a certain milestone that's gonna be you know a level with the final mastery goal is being given permission to practice on point

410
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:14,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm setting up my Instagram to record all of this.

411
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:16,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Sakura does dance.

412
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:23,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's the same thing that Nerd Fitness does.

413
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:28,916
[SPEAKER_05]: They make a game out of your fitness goals and stuff.

414
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:36,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just thinking that I'm also going to see about trying to play games while I'm on my balance ball.

415
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:42,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Bosu ball now, like the half-tone ones you stand on.

416
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:48,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm going to be setting up fitness-related video game challenges for myself too.

417
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, play so-and-such while doing like 10 plies or something.

418
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for that on its way.

419
00:40:58,441 --> 00:41:02,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be mixing the things that I love in a very weird way.

420
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I think gamification is so good for doing a lot of those tasks.

421
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:10,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you've heard me talk about how important Pikmin Bloom was for some of the things I was trying to accomplish.

422
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there are some like apps.

423
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is of any interest to you.

424
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:17,374
[SPEAKER_06]: You might just have your own system and that's great.

425
00:41:17,714 --> 00:41:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know there's been some apps I've seen out there and I was trying to Google real quick what they were called.

426
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:25,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was one coming up called Life RPG, but it keeps reading up the Google store.

427
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I saw one on iPhone.

428
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:28,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if it's just on both and I'm not getting it.

429
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:55,743
[SPEAKER_06]: but like where you would set your own tasks in a XP and gold rewards another one's coming up called Habitica or something is another one that's coming up I don't I've never heard of that one so again I don't want to endorse these because I don't know them but there I've definitely seen that there was one that I had at one point I thought it was life RPG or something like that that like you set up your own tasks in it and it's so it sort of builds the graphics and the engine and sort of builds the game around whatever tasks it is you want to do

430
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:58,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the live RPG one.

431
00:41:58,805 --> 00:41:59,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks very fascinating.

432
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:07,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that is actually kind of what I'm thinking of.

433
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:11,153
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can make a full game out of it, then let's absolutely do it.

434
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:12,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

435
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:16,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, we'll go to you then.

436
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:27,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this week I worked more on my big ride, so I've built up Raccoon Town.

437
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:33,099
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a shanty town that's inside of a giant mountain cave with raccoons in it.

438
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:40,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I kept calling it, originally I was calling it Raccoon City and people kept getting confused with Resident Evil, so I had to change it to Raccoon Town, which is fine.

439
00:42:41,437 --> 00:42:42,679
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that's all done now.

440
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Decorate the external part of the front of the roller coaster area.

441
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:53,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm doing the queue area right now, working on that.

442
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:57,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just need to hook up all the redstone and do some custom models in.

443
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:05,157
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just taking a very long time, but there's going to be a lot of stuff done all at once.

444
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:13,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've got some other... One of our supporting cast came back to finish up one of the areas that they said they were going to work on.

445
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:18,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And then another one expressed interest in making another ride on another side of the park.

446
00:43:18,685 --> 00:43:22,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my other cast member, Arrington, is finishing.

447
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:23,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he finished his...

448
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:27,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Game that's also in the parks.

449
00:43:27,736 --> 00:43:32,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Parks can become three times as big all of a sudden.

450
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:35,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a lot of work, but it looks really cool.

451
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:36,464
[SPEAKER_08]: The vibes are there.

452
00:43:37,845 --> 00:43:40,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Aside from that, Bellaltro is still playing that.

453
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:48,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but I haven't played much of the mobile version, but all of a sudden today I had a run where I'm getting three legendary jokers, which...

454
00:43:49,335 --> 00:44:01,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why I haven't gotten that in any other run yet so that's kind of interesting what necessarily triggers that but cool neat to see those yeah just been enjoying that a lot cool

455
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:04,385
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

456
00:44:23,004 --> 00:44:25,886
[SPEAKER_06]: which is certified Steam Deck Fresh or whatever.

457
00:44:26,906 --> 00:44:29,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played Pixel Poops also.

458
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Loki, I don't know if you know this.

459
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:34,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to play Pixel Poops number two, but I was having a hard time getting past the title screen.

460
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:37,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's something weird about the deck controls or something.

461
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:43,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if it's something you care about at this point, but I'll have to show you or something because I wasn't able to get it to work.

462
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And it could just be that I'm a noob, but I couldn't get it to work on the deck.

463
00:44:48,218 --> 00:45:04,899
[SPEAKER_06]: so because that was the one I was trying to play and then I just I was like all right I'll just play regular pixel poops that's fine maybe it's the emulator or something like that I think it is bubbled in there I think it is so it probably I probably need to reconfigure the controls somehow and I just couldn't figure it out but I was surprised the emulator wasn't like steam deck ready or whatever so

464
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, probably not.

465
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:08,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it makes sense.

466
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have to just remap it somehow.

467
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:14,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have to look into what its controls and remap it probably is ultimately what I have to do.

468
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:19,299
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so but I think I even popped a new achievement on super multitasking.

469
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:25,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So like when you go to my profile, you'll see I got like achievements like five years ago when it first came out and then I got a new one this week.

470
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:25,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

471
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:26,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out for YYR.

472
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:29,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think super multitasking is

473
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:46,476
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's it's not getting the flowers it deserves in the gaming community it's a brilliant game and I really encourage you all to check it out super multitasking um yeah I played World of Warcraft I hit level 80 on which is the new level cap right now uh on my character and uh yeah yay me um

474
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:48,677
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

475
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:12,279
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

476
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:30,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

477
00:46:30,236 --> 00:46:30,636
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 Challenge

478
00:46:44,631 --> 00:47:06,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to god we played that one snippet of Mario 2 for like a fucking hour trying to get an S rank and we did it by the way we did it so enough perseverance will get you there so Nintendo World Championships as well um shout out for emulators because I was like I I have decided that because I'm looking at like what do I want my goal to be next year and I've decided I want to beat

479
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: 35, and I'll tell you where I got that number from in a minute.

480
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:19,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to beat 35 retro games and I'm using quote on stream, but on stream might be YouTube recordings because sometimes I play games late at night.

481
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I, the one thing I just, I'm not going to be able to do is set a regular schedule.

482
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:29,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I can't do what Jamie does where it's like every Monday, like things in my schedule are too erratic.

483
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:32,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll kind of try to stream those things as I can, but

484
00:47:33,348 --> 00:47:34,789
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

485
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:48,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, that's one game a week.

486
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I thought, you know what, that might be too many.

487
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some games I want to play are like Final Fantasy 3.

488
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I am going to go by Super Nintendo names and, you know, kind of the original.

489
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:58,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to play Final Fantasy 3.

490
00:47:58,182 --> 00:48:00,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And some games are going to... And I might even play Chrono Trigger.

491
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I might.

492
00:48:02,064 --> 00:48:02,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I might.

493
00:48:03,145 --> 00:48:05,086
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, some games are going to take me longer than others.

494
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:06,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't want to do like one game a week.

495
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, well, maybe I'll do 25.

496
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, well, 25 doesn't seem like enough.

497
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:13,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So 35's in the middle.

498
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:13,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

499
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:22,332
[SPEAKER_06]: where it gives me a little room to do some long RPGs and then I can do some platformers to sort of fill in the gaps that I can beat a lot quicker.

500
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:26,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my goal for next year, so stay tuned.

501
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:33,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I was playing retros, I decided to fire up a game I used to play a lot of, which was Bust a Groove 2.

502
00:48:34,696 --> 00:48:37,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Jamie, I know you're going to cringe because I said Bust a Groove and not Bust a Move, but...

503
00:48:38,757 --> 00:48:41,958
[SPEAKER_06]: The plan is to ultimately beat both because there's achievements for both.

504
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just went with the one I knew.

505
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:47,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have to say, so Buster Groove 2 is pretty easy to get running in the emulator.

506
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:58,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Buster Groove, the original, like the timing window is way too tight in the core I was using.

507
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:05,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I either need to use like a standalone emulator or I'm using the wrong core because I think I switched the core to...

508
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:31,258
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the other ones and it worked a lot better but I still felt the timing would at least I was able to get past like a stage but I had such a hard time getting through uh the game uh but whereas Buster Groove 2 like it just it's like memory it just comes back and I was able to get all the way through Robo Z Gold in one sitting very easy so I was like all right I can do this so anyway that was fun um

509
00:49:32,563 --> 00:49:33,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Pagelin Rogue-like Pagel

510
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:50,616
[SPEAKER_06]: so you are fighting monsters in a dungeon but the whole battle mechanic runs off of Peggle basically or Plinko.

511
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:51,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Which game was that again?

512
00:49:51,736 --> 00:50:10,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Peglin, P-E-G-L-I-N and so yeah and the different pegs like you get like at the end of levels it's like this peg is going to make things worth double or the orange peg will split the ball into two and do these things so it's like you're buying different peg power-ups which

513
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:14,049
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

514
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:34,910
[SPEAKER_06]: DungeonCrawler DungeonClawler

515
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,207
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

516
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:40,641
[SPEAKER_06]: and then another random game I started playing thanks to Steam Deck this was actually bought for me by a listener a few months ago so thank you very much and I apologize it took me this long to really get into the game but I saw it came out of early access and now that I have the Steam Deck I was like oh I should go revisit this and it's a game called Dwarven Realms the best way I could describe this game is it's Diablo mixed with vampire survivors

517
00:51:42,006 --> 00:52:07,461
[SPEAKER_06]: so it kind of like has that Diablo look and feel to it in the interface but then like when you're actually going in the levels you kind of are doing like this auto sword swiping thing and you're kind of doing the funky dances around the enemies to kind of get them and then you get the power-ups where it's like oh it creates a lightning pull as you move or dragons come in and breathe fire you know these type of things which is very much like what Vampire Survivors kind of does so I was like oh this is really addicting

518
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:26,939
[SPEAKER_06]: and so even though it wasn't certified for Steam Deck because I guess it has small text and so it's not certified for Steam Deck it plays very well on Steam Deck so I was playing quite a bit of that game and so yeah that was a fun one to visit as well so I've been very busy this week playing games I didn't just play Final Fantasy XIV please clap

519
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:50,269
[SPEAKER_06]: yes and now I have more now I have more games to play I still want to play more Hades 2 which you know DarkSakura picked up the the full early access version for me and this uh this Zelda game or not Zelda game excuse me not Zelda game that Loki bought me looks very cool so I want to check that out as well especially if Loki builds any levels for it oh yeah I'll look at that I'm sure they're ridiculous

520
00:52:51,141 --> 00:53:14,685
[SPEAKER_06]: all right um oh I love that in chat uh Fifth Dream says Dungeon Claw is great as Joe and Hunter Matt says adding these to my wish list someone owes Rob money shit we need like an epic game store code or something I oh well anyway but I did get these on Steam just don't go through honey check out oh god did did you see the video I posted about that no I didn't hear about this what happened

521
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:22,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Honey, basically, a lot of the people who have been peddling it like influencers are actually losing money.

522
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I did see the video.

523
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:26,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't, I was distracted and didn't actually watch it.

524
00:53:26,893 --> 00:53:27,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:34,037
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, well, the thing is, is that it's replacing their referral codes with their own no matter what.

526
00:53:34,657 --> 00:53:35,157
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

527
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:26,521
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah I posted the video on my blue sky a few days ago and this person really goes into detail about it and it's pretty pretty insidious so um I I have never I I looked at it once and never installed it thank god because I knew it felt like a scam and I'm gratified to know that I was right so um

528
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:28,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, don't use it.

529
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:29,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Uninstall it.

530
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:32,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just disable it.

531
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:33,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Uninstall it.

532
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:47,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so funny, if you go in and you view your page source, like if you've got a developer mode, you can actually see it actively change the referral address.

533
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:51,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty nasty.

534
00:54:52,744 --> 00:54:59,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just look for discounts yourself, put a little bit of extra work into it, and don't put any more money in their pocket.

535
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:04,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I just re-blooped it on the Orange Lounge Radio Blue Sky over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

536
00:55:04,597 --> 00:55:06,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I went and dug up your post and re-blooped it.

537
00:55:06,459 --> 00:55:08,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get re-skieded.

538
00:55:08,842 --> 00:55:09,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I think that's really good.

539
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:11,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not ever using that term.

540
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not 12, okay?

541
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, some adult jokes are funny.

542
00:55:16,962 --> 00:55:18,003
[SPEAKER_06]: That one is just lazy.

543
00:55:18,143 --> 00:55:20,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So I reposted it or whatever you want to call it.

544
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:23,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a... I liked... Somebody called it bleat.

545
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:24,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I like bleat.

546
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't we call them bleats?

547
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:30,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it makes me think of Dead by Daylight because we always called the blight the bleat or the blort.

548
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:32,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just like bleat.

549
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So re-bleat.

550
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:37,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I re-bleated on the orangewatchradio.com blues guy.

551
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:42,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I decided to go with, by the way, with Habitica.

552
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go, DarkSakura.

553
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange, right?

554
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Just uninstalled it myself long overdue.

555
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:48,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

556
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:49,011
[SPEAKER_06]: You got one.

557
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:51,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

558
00:55:51,872 --> 00:56:00,894
[SPEAKER_05]: This is... So I've put it on myself to do 15 minutes of bar and 10 minutes of cleaning up crap.

559
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:11,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, I'm putting some stuff on here that... It's also got this cute little pixel girl and everything, so... I think I'm into this one.

560
00:56:11,123 --> 00:56:12,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, is this the live RPG?

561
00:56:13,405 --> 00:56:15,406
[SPEAKER_05]: No, live RPG ended up being something different.

562
00:56:15,586 --> 00:56:16,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

563
00:56:17,046 --> 00:56:18,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using the Habitica.

564
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:19,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Habitica.

565
00:56:19,548 --> 00:56:19,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

566
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:21,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice!

567
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:22,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let me make sure...

568
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:24,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Gamified Task Manager.

569
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:31,967
[SPEAKER_06]: If that works out well for you, I want to check back in with you next week and see how you liked it because I might want to use it too.

570
00:56:33,568 --> 00:56:33,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

571
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:36,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to wait for the DarkSakura endorsement.

572
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Washing the dishes on here?

573
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:38,571
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thank you.

574
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:45,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's giving me dailies to do and I'm going to be doing different dailies.

575
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:45,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

576
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:49,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we got through everybody's gaming week.

577
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:51,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, mine was long, but hey, I played a lot of games.

578
00:56:51,664 --> 00:56:52,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, good job me.

579
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:55,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to some headlines.

580
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:56,607
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have some headlines this week.

581
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:57,688
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few things in the news.

582
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe these aren't very meaty stories we might get into in other weeks, but we will take what we can get.

583
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:04,192
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few things here.

584
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:11,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, a lot of these things this week, homemade, mod community, fan community type affair.

585
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:13,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's taking the time off right now.

586
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's working overtime, but this is great.

587
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,981
[SPEAKER_06]: We get things like this, Loki, right?

588
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:18,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

589
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome looking.

590
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:54,206
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a video demonstrating it on an ultra-wide monitor running Star Fox 64's intro, which is pretty cool.

591
00:57:56,767 --> 00:57:57,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Neat.

592
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:04,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'd be curious about multiplayer support because I used to love playing the dogfights that they used to have in that game.

593
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:05,851
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a lot of fun.

594
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:08,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I definitely want to check this out.

595
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,148
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds really cool.

596
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:18,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think it's so cool to take such an older game and really open it up for a modern sort of setup.

597
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's so cool.

598
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:21,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's nice.

599
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:26,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also good for like preservation as well, because then you can still be able to play it on like modern hardware and everything.

600
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a... It's probably also great for the Steam Deck.

601
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:32,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, yeah.

602
00:58:32,832 --> 00:58:37,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have to have, you know, because they obviously are not going to distribute the Star Fox 64 ROM.

603
00:58:37,654 --> 00:58:43,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as sort of a Nintendo legal team protection system,

604
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: They make it very clear in their website and a lot of documentation.

605
00:58:46,618 --> 00:58:48,239
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to have your own copy of the game.

606
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:50,240
[SPEAKER_06]: This will not work without your own copy of the game.

607
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't really get into reasons why.

608
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:54,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because all you really need is the ROM, right?

609
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:57,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the ROM does the conversion.

610
00:58:57,723 --> 00:59:00,744
[SPEAKER_06]: For legal reasons, they are wording it the way they're wording it.

611
00:59:02,145 --> 00:59:02,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

612
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:04,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

613
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:12,339
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeRite in chat points out, my first 120 star run in Mario 64 was on one of the unofficial ports on the Vita.

614
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:14,640
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100Matt sends a YouTube.

615
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,480
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks pretty cool.

616
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a side-by-side comparison.

617
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:18,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, holy crap.

618
00:59:18,482 --> 00:59:19,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't really seen this.

619
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:24,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bring this up for those that are watching live tonight over at VOG Network.

620
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:50,845
[SPEAKER_06]: but for those that are listening on the podcast feed you can definitely see it like what the thing that jumps out to me is the frame rate yeah the frame rate on this PC version is impressive I mean yes it's got the widescreen you know element to it which is you know also impressive that you kind of see more of the level than you would on the Nintendo 64 version but like this yeah just the frame rate alone it just that's what I'm saying like that so that's what's so frustrating about this it's like

621
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:54,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo could do this.

622
00:59:55,698 --> 00:59:58,739
[SPEAKER_08]: You literally probably could just use their executable that they've already created.

623
00:59:58,759 --> 01:00:05,584
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do this yourself and put it on the Switch and call it the enhanced version or something like that and people would be eating this crap up.

624
01:00:05,824 --> 01:00:08,846
[SPEAKER_08]: You could just do that with your whole Nintendo 64 library or whatever.

625
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:12,908
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where their legal team kind of shoots themselves in the foot because, and I...

626
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:18,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand why companies do this, but it's also very frustrating because this exists.

627
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:25,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody on the Nintendo legal team is going to say we cannot release this because it already exists out there.

628
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:33,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a liability for Nintendo that this organization says you took our files and sues us for what we did.

629
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,833
[SPEAKER_08]: That hasn't stopped them in the past.

630
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:38,975
[SPEAKER_08]: They've used emulators from third parties as well.

631
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, and don't get me wrong.

632
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:43,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You and I are actually on the same page.

633
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, this is what the discussion is that happens in Nintendo's legal camp.

634
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:54,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Why it's so frustrating that when you see these fans innovating in ways that Nintendo ought to be innovating, it's why Nintendo doesn't do it.

635
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:58,214
[SPEAKER_06]: is because then the legal team goes, yeah.

636
01:00:58,274 --> 01:01:01,358
[SPEAKER_06]: QuestBuster in chat says, Bloodborne has entered the chat.

637
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that Bloodborne cart thing, right?

638
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:08,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they ended up releasing that, but as they called it something else.

639
01:01:08,726 --> 01:01:11,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, but that one, see, that's the perfect example.

640
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,591
[SPEAKER_08]: So like Nintendo, what they would probably do is say...

641
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:14,852
[SPEAKER_06]: God, this looks so good.

642
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:35,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why can't they just make this StarKitty64?

643
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:36,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Change the fox into a kitty.

644
01:01:37,918 --> 01:01:40,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to all the StarFox fans and palco, just make it StarKitty.

645
01:01:41,543 --> 01:01:42,204
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you say that.

646
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:47,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have a game that is very much like StarFox that's basically kind of like...

647
01:01:49,319 --> 01:02:11,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even remember what it's called now President Cat in Space yes Space Cat Star Fox would be President Cat in Space absolutely yeah I don't remember what it's called now let's see I'm trying to remember what it's called uh

648
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:17,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I'll figure it out and I'll let you know.

649
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:20,136
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, yeah, there's an indie game that's like Star Fox.

650
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:24,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's X Zodiac.

651
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:29,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So EX Zodiac is, it's essentially Star Fox.

652
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Deft beats you to it in chat, so gold star for Deft.

653
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:37,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I backed that on Kickstarter a long time ago and I have it in my library as well.

654
01:02:37,483 --> 01:02:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: But it looks awesome.

655
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:42,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see other comments and chats.

656
01:02:42,703 --> 01:02:47,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Def says, there's one in development right now more akin to Star Fox 64, but I forget the name.

657
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,033
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTutsia says, do we need to update the Dream Games folder?

658
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:50,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

659
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a bleat on that later.

660
01:02:52,976 --> 01:02:54,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So hold that thought.

661
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:54,659
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

662
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:55,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

663
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:11,583
[SPEAKER_06]: for now let's move on to our next story which has to do with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle one of those games I've kind of missed amongst all the holiday stuff that's been going on and I sort of regret it because apparently this game is apparently really good I think Tara was playing it but I haven't seen what they thought of it

664
01:03:12,573 --> 01:03:20,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, mostly it's been getting, I don't know what they thought specifically, but mostly, most critics are really favorable on this.

665
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:31,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I mentioned last week, many critics are saying it's pretty much a better Indiana Jones experience than the last two movies, which is a pretty good compliment there that gaming's getting it right when Hollywood is not.

666
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:36,451
[SPEAKER_06]: And if rumors are to be believed, this is a rumor, but it's, you ready?

667
01:03:37,212 --> 01:03:40,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for the holidays, I find this rumor to be plausible.

668
01:03:41,874 --> 01:03:53,340
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's coming from a Windows Central journalist and leaker named Jez Corden who said that they've heard that Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones.

669
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was on an episode of the Xbox Two podcast.

670
01:03:56,602 --> 01:03:57,422
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of a funny name.

671
01:03:58,443 --> 01:04:00,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Not long after the launch of the game.

672
01:04:00,464 --> 01:04:07,928
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know exactly how many copies of the game this has moved, but it does believe like through other types of tracking that

673
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:19,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like this game was the second best-selling full release in North America, its week of release, trailing just Call of Duty Black Ops 6, which to be fair at this point is another Microsoft game.

674
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:26,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So for Microsoft to be holding the first two spots with different genres of games is a pretty fucking good place to be for them.

675
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure they're happy.

676
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, again, if the...

677
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:33,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney

678
01:04:49,207 --> 01:04:50,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Money, money, money for the likeness and all that.

679
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:54,513
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's Troy Baker that does the voice in the game.

680
01:04:54,673 --> 01:05:01,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And Harrison Ford has given props to the game and Troy Baker's great performance as Indiana Jones.

681
01:05:02,162 --> 01:05:03,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's quite the endorsement there.

682
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:08,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, Indiana Jones has a future in video games that I'm not sure it has in movies.

683
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:09,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's...

684
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:14,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I just... It's just such an interesting thing to be saying.

685
01:05:14,417 --> 01:05:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is that, you know, especially for all the talk all these years of really bad movie ports into games, I think we all know that...

686
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:29,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games as an art form are fully capable of experiences sometimes even beyond those what movies can provide.

687
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:33,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Final Fantasy series.

688
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:37,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure somebody would love to turn some of those Final Fantasy games into a movie.

689
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:38,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to hit the same way?

690
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:39,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt it.

691
01:05:40,253 --> 01:05:41,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll happen someday.

692
01:05:41,174 --> 01:05:43,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to turn Final Fantasy VII into a movie someday.

693
01:05:44,797 --> 01:05:47,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides Avenger, I mean literally the plot of VII.

694
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:49,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean Spirits Within?

695
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:49,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

696
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:50,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

697
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,371
[SPEAKER_06]: That was different though.

698
01:05:52,392 --> 01:05:54,753
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why Spirits Within didn't work is because it wasn't a game.

699
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:58,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Spirits Within should have been a game, not a movie.

700
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:05,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, technically there was the anime for 5, but yeah, that one was alright.

701
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:06,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

702
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:21,550
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah I think so Questmaster says Great Circle is amazing probably my favorite one right now Tiger Claw says they can make a lot of these games if they stick to the era between the 30s and 40s they can tell all kinds of stories just pick a year look

703
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

704
01:06:51,294 --> 01:07:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: SS2100 Matt says Troy Baker is going to get a pay bump next game that's for sure who else can they find that's officially endorsed by Harrison Ford it is how do I say this without sounding mean I'm very happy for Troy Baker and I think it's great that he's doing such a good job I do find it

705
01:07:12,042 --> 01:07:13,423
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

706
01:07:39,574 --> 01:07:39,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else?

707
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Indiana Jones is spoken for.

708
01:07:42,778 --> 01:07:53,432
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if other Hollywood studios start to look to how do we make an Indiana Jones and the Great Circle out of our dead movie franchise, which will happen.

709
01:07:54,674 --> 01:07:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: It will happen.

710
01:07:56,849 --> 01:07:57,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

711
01:08:23,877 --> 01:08:43,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they are and I think they are like it's on the table that a mummy that a mummy another mummy reboot is coming but like that that's actually pop culture that's a great call out like the universal villain like that would actually make for a great gaming series I think if they could just find the right partner and the right creative version with a vision with that

712
01:08:44,266 --> 01:09:04,762
[SPEAKER_06]: but um with Nosferatu being successful like Nosferatu did pretty well at the box office this weekend if I'm not mistaken I've heard a lot of people speaking pretty good on that movie so I'm assuming with that doing well um there there may still be talk about classic horror icons coming to the screen still um so we'll see um

713
01:09:05,836 --> 01:09:16,485
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, it's been very interesting to watch the Sonic... Because the media, the Hollywood media is framing it all as a Sonic versus the Lion King debate.

714
01:09:17,205 --> 01:09:20,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess some days, Sonic is winning.

715
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:22,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Some days, the Lion King is winning.

716
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of running neck and neck.

717
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:27,994
[SPEAKER_06]: But as we know, last weekend, Sonic ended up being better at the box.

718
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:32,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, the third Sonic movie, critically, is the best one.

719
01:09:33,038 --> 01:09:34,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like...

720
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:35,761
[SPEAKER_06]: What's happening?

721
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:36,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't this weird?

722
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And just like, why does it matter?

723
01:09:40,424 --> 01:09:44,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe from a financial standpoint, but just let people like what they like and not make a contest out of it.

724
01:09:44,768 --> 01:09:45,828
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure, for sure.

725
01:09:45,908 --> 01:09:49,551
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's, you know, industry, money, investing, all that garbage, blah, blah, blah.

726
01:09:50,032 --> 01:10:04,603
[SPEAKER_06]: But now that I'm sitting here saying this part out loud, I'm realizing here I am talking about Hollywood franchises finding success in video games and now video games finding huge success in Hollywood.

727
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,791
[SPEAKER_01]: 2025 hasn't even started yet.

728
01:10:13,853 --> 01:10:14,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild.

729
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:19,796
[SPEAKER_06]: SG100 Matt in chat says, I think we can all agree.

730
01:10:20,157 --> 01:10:26,501
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are always up and coming voice actors, then they can always find someone for a role and never a reason to go with AI voices.

731
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:26,501
100%.

732
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:27,501
[SPEAKER_06]: 110%.

733
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:27,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Never AI voices.

734
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:27,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.

735
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:28,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless...

736
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:45,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Your very niche, very niche circumstance where the actor of an iconic role has given express permission for it to happen, such as James Earl Jones and Vader.

737
01:10:45,981 --> 01:10:48,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I'm going to say I still kind of don't like the idea.

738
01:10:48,842 --> 01:10:49,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't.

739
01:10:50,043 --> 01:10:51,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think you find somebody new to do it.

740
01:10:51,603 --> 01:10:56,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But if that's James Earl Jones's wishes, he created the character.

741
01:10:57,906 --> 01:11:00,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, he created the iconic of the character.

742
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:03,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that is his wish.

743
01:11:03,548 --> 01:11:03,668
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

744
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:10,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, S200 Matt says, Sonic has had quite the redemption arc since the creepy Sonic.

745
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:14,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Tiger Class says this is what happens when the studios listen to the fans.

746
01:11:14,285 --> 01:11:14,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

747
01:11:14,906 --> 01:11:18,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And yep, Sonic 4 is scheduled to release spring 2027.

748
01:11:18,428 --> 01:11:21,370
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact a Sonic 4 movie is coming.

749
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Least surprising news of the year.

750
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:25,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it's coming.

751
01:11:26,035 --> 01:11:30,461
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're talking about Sonic competing with a Lion King movie, of course the Sonic 4 is coming.

752
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:32,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yes, I know there's plenty of... They already said there is.

753
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:35,848
[SPEAKER_06]: There's teases and shit, of course, but of course the Sonic 4 is coming.

754
01:11:35,909 --> 01:11:36,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they already said it is.

755
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:37,771
[SPEAKER_08]: They already greenlit.

756
01:11:37,911 --> 01:11:38,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

757
01:11:38,853 --> 01:11:39,293
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that.

758
01:11:40,054 --> 01:11:42,798
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else they apparently fucking greenlit, which we don't fucking need?

759
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:47,176
[SPEAKER_06]: An American Version of Squid Game by David Fincher.

760
01:11:47,676 --> 01:11:47,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

761
01:11:48,377 --> 01:11:49,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking A. Why?

762
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,402
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to just do Squid Game with American actors.

763
01:11:54,902 --> 01:11:56,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is Squid Game now, Netflix.

764
01:11:56,924 --> 01:11:59,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a world that has subtitles.

765
01:11:59,286 --> 01:12:02,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you must, if you must, you can do dubs.

766
01:12:02,829 --> 01:12:03,429
[SPEAKER_06]: If you must.

767
01:12:05,831 --> 01:12:07,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But Squid Game already exists.

768
01:12:07,993 --> 01:12:09,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we need an American version of Squid Game?

769
01:12:09,714 --> 01:12:10,035
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't.

770
01:12:11,254 --> 01:12:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: We have that fucking reality show.

771
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:15,897
[SPEAKER_06]: The Squid Game, the game.

772
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,718
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck was that thing called?

773
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:22,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Squid Game, but it's real, but it's not because you're not getting shot, but you have paint packs.

774
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,001
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole thing.

775
01:12:24,762 --> 01:12:26,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the American version of Squid Game.

776
01:12:26,303 --> 01:12:27,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of anything.

777
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:29,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Squid Game or something?

778
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just so sick of Squid Game.

779
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:33,207
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the copy.

780
01:12:33,227 --> 01:12:34,547
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not doing a Squid Game thing.

781
01:12:34,607 --> 01:12:36,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of like a big team effort type of game.

782
01:12:37,049 --> 01:12:37,089
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

783
01:12:37,429 --> 01:12:37,809
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

784
01:12:37,869 --> 01:12:41,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that MrBeast has his own game, but MrBeast also did a Squid Game thing better than Netflix.

785
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:42,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he did a YouTube.

786
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: He did do a YouTube.

787
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:43,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

788
01:12:43,711 --> 01:12:45,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, he did that as well.

789
01:12:45,592 --> 01:12:57,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's like, it's like, I get it that, like, Stranger Things is big, and Squid Game is big, but my god, dude, don't go all in on one thing.

790
01:12:57,797 --> 01:13:00,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, your network is not just that one thing.

791
01:13:00,978 --> 01:13:02,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, just calm it down.

792
01:13:03,059 --> 01:13:04,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, why make a YouTube

793
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:11,579
[SPEAKER_08]: What purpose could you possibly want an English version of Squid Game?

794
01:13:11,619 --> 01:13:12,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to lose.

795
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:14,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be not good.

796
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

797
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

798
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:16,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

799
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:19,441
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm about to be totally hypocritical, and I don't care.

800
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:31,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Because whereas I do not support this, what I will continue to support, because somehow I have fallen down this rabbit hole on TikTok, I will support international versions of the Golden Girls so I can hear the international theme songs.

801
01:13:32,003 --> 01:13:32,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

802
01:13:32,683 --> 01:14:00,537
[SPEAKER_06]: or it's the quote unquote normal theme song being sung in another language which I think was the Finnish Danish version of the show is the same song in a different language but I've fallen down this hole on TikTok where now it shows me like here's the Russian version of the Golden Girls here's the Turkish version of the Golden Girls and I'm like this is fun we should adapt the Golden Girls in every country so that I will support but that's different

803
01:14:02,831 --> 01:14:06,793
[SPEAKER_06]: A sitcom is also kind of a lot different in many ways.

804
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:15,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a sitcom, especially because there's a lot of nuances and humor and things like that, I feel like a sitcom, there's more reasons to port something like that.

805
01:14:18,122 --> 01:14:18,442
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

806
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:25,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Mike Def says, I'm surprised there's not a Mexican version of the Golden Girls, all things considered.

807
01:14:25,187 --> 01:14:25,768
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not?

808
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:26,188
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

809
01:14:26,807 --> 01:14:28,148
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

810
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: well

811
01:14:40,063 --> 01:15:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: there is an amazing little game called Night Slashers and there is going to be a soundtrack and physical edition released this is going to be you can get the physical edition with the soundtrack on February 20th, 2025 we have a PS4, PS5 and Switch version for Night Slashers Remake and yeah hopefully folks will like it

812
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:14,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for remakes of games that kind of need them.

813
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:16,281
[SPEAKER_05]: The music is pretty good.

814
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm listening to just some from the remake and it's actually really good.

815
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:20,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go get it.

816
01:15:21,363 --> 01:15:22,343
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's out, that is.

817
01:15:23,363 --> 01:15:24,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki, we'll go back to you.

818
01:15:26,144 --> 01:15:37,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so we've got a little bit talking about some... This kind of goes back to that whole thing we were just talking about with Indiana Jones.

819
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:37,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Like,

820
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:41,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Company sees money, wants more money.

821
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:46,254
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now we have PlayStation saying, hey, you know what?

822
01:15:46,954 --> 01:15:51,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take some of those old IPs we have and make more money with them.

823
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:56,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy because we saw that Astro Bot, you know, had like

824
01:15:57,583 --> 01:16:21,610
[SPEAKER_08]: things were popular with that with the little different IP references in that game but yeah, our extensive IP portfolio is an important asset of PlayStation and an important thing so that they don't lose the trademark on it probably as well so of course they're going to try to leverage that to make more games off of older IP

825
01:16:23,387 --> 01:16:28,071
[SPEAKER_08]: because, you know, we got to make more Squid Game and we got to make more... No, Intelligent Cube too.

826
01:16:28,111 --> 01:16:28,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Intelligent Cube.

827
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:28,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

828
01:16:34,249 --> 01:16:35,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Intelligent Hypercube.

829
01:16:36,729 --> 01:16:37,330
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

830
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:49,592
[SPEAKER_06]: When I think of dormant PlayStation legacy IP that needs to fucking come back, Parappa the Rappa and Unjamalami and their team-up adventure.

831
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:53,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, spoiler alert, Parappa the Rappa's in Unjamalami when you get to a certain point.

832
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:55,473
[SPEAKER_06]: But I digress.

833
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:58,913
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the team-up adventure between Parappa the Rappa and Unjamalami.

834
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they have a third friend.

835
01:17:03,294 --> 01:17:09,598
[SPEAKER_06]: that's like country music or R&B or something, like a different genre, like something.

836
01:17:10,298 --> 01:17:10,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Polka.

837
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:11,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Polka!

838
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

839
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a klezmer band player.

840
01:17:18,143 --> 01:17:18,924
[SPEAKER_05]: With their clarinet.

841
01:17:19,224 --> 01:17:19,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

842
01:17:21,105 --> 01:17:22,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And their name is Minuet Clarinet.

843
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:24,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.

844
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:25,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, there you go.

845
01:17:25,027 --> 01:17:25,988
[SPEAKER_08]: It writes itself.

846
01:17:26,148 --> 01:17:30,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Parappa the Rappa, Um Jamma Lammy, and their new friend Tommy the Tuba Player.

847
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:30,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

848
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: or Trombone.

849
01:17:33,851 --> 01:17:35,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the Trombone Hero crossover.

850
01:17:38,114 --> 01:17:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The ideas just write themselves, y'all.

851
01:17:41,176 --> 01:17:42,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideas write themselves.

852
01:17:43,217 --> 01:17:43,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

853
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:45,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I still like Minuet the Clarinet.

854
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

855
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,782
[SPEAKER_06]: As a former clarinet player, it has a soft space in my heart.

856
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:51,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I played clarinet.

857
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:54,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a big clarinet.

858
01:17:54,605 --> 01:17:55,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you played the big.

859
01:17:56,126 --> 01:17:57,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that for maybe like a month.

860
01:17:59,878 --> 01:18:01,943
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, we have Contra Alto Clarinet Hero.

861
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:06,115
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about Bellatro.

862
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:15,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Bellatro, because thanks to a lot of the recent exposure it's been getting between game awards, you know, just kind of the resurgence of the games.

863
01:18:15,622 --> 01:18:18,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what the fuck this thing came across my feed.

864
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:21,266
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is this new commercial with Ben Star in it?

865
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:25,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that like a legit commercial or is that just some type of parody that came up?

866
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:26,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

867
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:30,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so fucking funny that came up.

868
01:18:30,453 --> 01:18:31,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, is it on YouTube somewhere?

869
01:18:33,925 --> 01:18:34,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to show these to folks.

870
01:18:34,845 --> 01:18:40,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only seen the one that they did before that about the new card packs, but I don't know the Ben Star one.

871
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:47,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's the Friends of Jimbo pack.

872
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:49,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this something that was during the Game Awards?

873
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a Friends of Jimbo thing.

874
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:52,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

875
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:53,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that Ben Star doing that?

876
01:18:54,091 --> 01:18:54,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it?

877
01:18:55,471 --> 01:18:55,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

878
01:18:56,051 --> 01:18:57,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to show this again.

879
01:18:57,952 --> 01:18:58,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the whole...

880
01:19:03,504 --> 01:19:04,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear that's Ben Starr.

881
01:19:05,265 --> 01:19:07,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's the whole voice and everything.

882
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:11,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I saw that, but I didn't know that it was Ben Starr.

883
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not, this is very embarrassing.

884
01:19:14,311 --> 01:19:16,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, SGO100Matt says it is Ben Starr.

885
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:17,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

886
01:19:17,413 --> 01:19:19,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was like, this is going to be very embarrassing if I'm wrong.

887
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:20,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it was him for sure.

888
01:19:21,856 --> 01:19:28,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Anyway, that just... Oh yeah, okay, so the comments are confirming it's Ben Starr.

889
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:28,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Phew.

890
01:19:29,817 --> 01:19:33,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to see he's getting work.

891
01:19:33,423 --> 01:19:38,911
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to be in that parthenon of voice actors that are consistently getting work, but good for him.

892
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:40,714
[SPEAKER_06]: He's so great at what he does.

893
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:41,696
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the...

894
01:19:43,402 --> 01:19:47,085
[SPEAKER_06]: The commercial with Ben Stars out there for the new expansion, all that stuff.

895
01:19:47,445 --> 01:19:52,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bellatro has reached a new concurrent player peak.

896
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:56,913
[SPEAKER_06]: 37,000 was the peak when it was out earlier in the year, but now it's up to 38,000.

897
01:19:56,993 --> 01:19:59,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'm sure Steam sale helped with that.

898
01:20:01,056 --> 01:20:02,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it did too.

899
01:20:02,977 --> 01:20:16,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Local Thunk is the game's creator who has celebrated the news on social media saying, Thanks to a crazy December with the Game Awards, two Steam sales, Christmas, and a Markiplier video, we surpassed our all-time concurrent player peak on Steam.

900
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:19,868
[SPEAKER_06]: The previous peak was around the launch in February.

901
01:20:20,728 --> 01:20:22,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

902
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:25,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there was a Mark Plyer video and that guy still gets a ton of views.

903
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,831
[SPEAKER_06]: 2.5 million views for a game called My New Crippling Addiction.

904
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:30,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that played into it.

905
01:20:31,132 --> 01:20:33,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, this game is red hot.

906
01:20:33,773 --> 01:20:37,234
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, I'm going to have to give it another try.

907
01:20:37,774 --> 01:20:38,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't land with me.

908
01:20:38,555 --> 01:20:39,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

909
01:20:39,135 --> 01:20:40,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

910
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:41,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think it was bad.

911
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:44,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just like, I don't know if I get the hype.

912
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:46,998
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to give it another try.

913
01:20:47,299 --> 01:20:49,882
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what other game didn't land for me the first time?

914
01:20:50,282 --> 01:20:50,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect.

915
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And then look what fucking happened.

916
01:20:55,127 --> 01:20:56,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I just have to try it.

917
01:20:56,669 --> 01:21:03,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe having the Steam Deck, except I have Bellator on PS5, but maybe having the Steam Deck will somehow change my mind.

918
01:21:04,252 --> 01:21:06,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've played it, like, mobile and stuff.

919
01:21:06,254 --> 01:21:07,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say, like, it depends.

920
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:09,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, at first, it may not be that exciting.

921
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:11,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I just do, like, a run or so every so often.

922
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:12,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

923
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:18,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes you have, you know, certain runs can be pretty exciting, certain runs are not.

924
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:25,951
[SPEAKER_08]: But each run you do, you unlock more things to make more runs exciting later on type of stuff.

925
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:26,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

926
01:21:26,947 --> 01:21:29,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Def says we're ready to lose Rob in the following week.

927
01:21:29,491 --> 01:21:31,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did I say I was going to beat 35 retro games?

928
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I meant I was going to play Bellatro for 35 weeks.

929
01:21:34,117 --> 01:21:34,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually what I meant.

930
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:37,222
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

931
01:21:38,303 --> 01:21:39,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

932
01:21:41,357 --> 01:21:44,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Sega has put their foot down.

933
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:51,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Utsumi Ishuji, who is the Sega president, said that they're not going to be doing any more Sega mini consoles.

934
01:21:52,264 --> 01:21:53,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, nope, nope, nope, not happening.

935
01:21:54,585 --> 01:21:57,467
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, this quote says, I'm not going for the mini direction.

936
01:21:57,587 --> 01:21:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not me.

937
01:21:58,348 --> 01:21:59,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to embrace modern gamers.

938
01:21:59,888 --> 01:22:01,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not a retro company.

939
01:22:01,509 --> 01:22:02,850
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate our legacy.

940
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:03,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We value it.

941
01:22:03,731 --> 01:22:05,672
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, we want to deliver something new.

942
01:22:05,772 --> 01:22:07,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we'll become history.

943
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:08,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not what we're aiming for.

944
01:22:12,918 --> 01:22:16,180
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they said Rest R.I.P.

945
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:41,998
[SPEAKER_06]: and peace The Genesis Mini I did hear They must not like money Well, I heard that at CES They're supposed to have a partnership coming with MyArcade That makes these little The baby cabs you see in the shelving I have a bunch of them Yeah, I know you have some too Apparently Sega is going to do some of those It's just like their dedicated mini Everybody's sitting here going Dreamcast Mini Mini when?

946
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:43,259
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no.

947
01:22:43,419 --> 01:22:44,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Dreamcast Mini.

948
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,382
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more of the candy cabs.

949
01:22:46,422 --> 01:22:47,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember how they did those?

950
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:53,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they had the Astro City that had Sega games on it too, like Virtua Fighter and all that stuff.

951
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:54,730
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we need more of.

952
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:00,335
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get quarter-sized, well, I mean, I don't know what a quarter-sized Astro City cab would look like.

953
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:01,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be even smaller.

954
01:23:01,616 --> 01:23:02,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

955
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:04,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just hook up my Saturn.

956
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:24,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Or I have a 32X I have a CDX I can just hook this stuff up The mini arcades are fun I wish they'd release Nevercade this side What room do I have for any more of those?

957
01:23:28,414 --> 01:23:33,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly enough You can hang them from the roof I have a very tall ceiling

958
01:23:37,280 --> 01:24:03,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I'm just like they're cool I like the little collectibles but I get it all they have to do is make sure they have a decent emulator built into the system they'll play the games as close as natively as possible and boom, there you go and PodCulture you can buy broken Saturns that have functional optical drives replacing them is not that hard

959
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:08,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And DT says, yeah, there's a cart you can get to.

960
01:24:09,476 --> 01:24:10,897
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a ROM loader one.

961
01:24:11,137 --> 01:24:14,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, you know, I like the originals.

962
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:22,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that even though my office, what you see on camera, is full for the space of the arcade games, they're off screen.

963
01:24:22,486 --> 01:24:28,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see it, but there's a walk-in closet over here that I would be able to clean up pretty easy.

964
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:31,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And the walk-in closet I don't think could fit the...

965
01:24:31,553 --> 01:24:34,535
[SPEAKER_06]: The Burger Time, it's just a little too tall, or the Tron.

966
01:24:34,795 --> 01:24:37,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it could fit are these little baby machines on shelves.

967
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:46,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if I do end up picking up a couple more candy cabs or little baby machines, I probably will start to quote-unquote build out the walk-in closet with some of those.

968
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:52,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is still space for little things to grow, just not any more big machines.

969
01:24:52,405 --> 01:24:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess I could always flip it.

970
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:57,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I could fit one more big machine here and move these guys in the closet.

971
01:24:57,688 --> 01:24:57,889
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

972
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:20,002
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe because um Alan and I keep looking at a Mortal Kombat 2 cab that has internet connectivity and it has all the old like Williams games like joust and shit in it and I'm like oh if I had to get a machine right now that's the one I'd get but then we also need to be responsible and buy other things than our arcade machines so

973
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:30,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they had like one of the arcade one-ups that was all the midway driving games like Arctic Thunder, Hydro Thunder, you know, San Francisco Rush.

974
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:30,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.

975
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:32,592
[SPEAKER_08]: All that stuff.

976
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:34,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess Russell 2049.

977
01:25:34,133 --> 01:25:38,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really play the new ones, but yeah, that would be cool.

978
01:25:38,776 --> 01:25:40,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, PodCulture says, I have that cab.

979
01:25:40,838 --> 01:25:41,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It has Tapper too.

980
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:45,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like a solid cab and it keeps going on sale.

981
01:25:45,582 --> 01:25:47,163
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very tempting, but you know.

982
01:25:48,998 --> 01:25:54,100
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to look at big boy purchases as well and not just more arcade machines.

983
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,580
[SPEAKER_06]: The little baby will hold me over for another year.

984
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

985
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:02,562
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have a couple more stories for you and then we'll get to the classic game of the week, Loki.

986
01:26:04,082 --> 01:26:07,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so there was... I don't know how this stuff got out.

987
01:26:08,023 --> 01:26:15,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw one story that it got leaked and then now it's up on Internet Archive, but apparently an old...

988
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:31,278
[SPEAKER_08]: They say E3 2K build and Halo 1 Spear Test, which was the early, early, early, early version of Halo that was the game before it was a first person shooter.

989
01:26:31,338 --> 01:26:35,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a third person shooter is now available to play.

990
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:38,524
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually get the E3, the 2003 E3 demo

991
01:26:42,008 --> 01:26:43,669
[SPEAKER_08]: through the internet archive.

992
01:26:43,769 --> 01:26:47,031
[SPEAKER_08]: They have it hosted there to check out.

993
01:26:47,671 --> 01:26:51,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear I saw that there was more stuff that leaked out about it.

994
01:26:51,934 --> 01:27:00,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it was a hack or a leak or something like that, but there was a bunch of code and source material that was available that was from all of this stuff.

995
01:27:00,919 --> 01:27:05,321
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know this was one of the things that did come out of it that was kind of neat to check out.

996
01:27:07,743 --> 01:27:07,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

997
01:27:08,905 --> 01:27:31,797
[SPEAKER_06]: you're interested they've got it to check out it does look certainly different I love to see like these like conceptually like here's what it was before and you know that that whole type of thing I think that's really cool it's it's nice yeah to have this news coming out when you have the negative news of you know the Cartoon Network games vanishing into you know space at this point it's just yeah

998
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:33,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

999
01:27:33,671 --> 01:27:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, along those same lines, the last story I have for us tonight has to do with the website Hidden Palace, which, you know, kind of finds a lot of old ROMs or things in development and looks a lot a lot of things like that have changed or what have you.

1000
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:53,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently there was a bunch of Nintendo prototypes that were found.

1001
01:27:54,578 --> 01:28:03,711
[SPEAKER_06]: They were acquired by the guy that runs SideQuest Games and is apparently one of the organizers of the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, which I'd love to get to next year if I'm able to, by the way.

1002
01:28:03,931 --> 01:28:05,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always wanted to go up there for that.

1003
01:28:05,914 --> 01:28:06,914
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these days I'll get there.

1004
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:12,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the prototypes were graded and then released.

1005
01:28:13,476 --> 01:28:23,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So now there are all sorts of prototypes that are available at HiddenPalace.org, including 1943, the Battle of Midway.

1006
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,200
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an Addams Family prototype.

1007
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,841
[SPEAKER_06]: There's too many here for me to list, but just some that jump out at me.

1008
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Bionic Commando has a prototype.

1009
01:28:31,642 --> 01:28:32,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Fester's Quest prototype.

1010
01:28:33,062 --> 01:28:34,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Gun.Smoke prototype.

1011
01:28:35,563 --> 01:28:57,935
[SPEAKER_06]: um Mickey's Ultimate Challenge, Shadowrun, Solomon's Key um apparently some Genesis prototypes were also uh released as well Beyond Zero Tolerance and Dominus uh and uh also some other prototypes Rygar, Legendary Wings uh and then even more so like there's just a ton of stuff that showed up

1012
01:28:58,435 --> 01:28:59,597
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1013
01:29:19,676 --> 01:29:48,426
[SPEAKER_06]: there's an earlier copyright date so it shows copyright 1986 and the publisher is credited to Romstar as opposed to Capcom so that's kind of interesting so but that's otherwise it doesn't sound like a whole lot is really really different with the game but still it's neat to see these things like as frozen in a particular part of time so all right well speaking of things frozen in time once a week here on this show we'd like to take a trip down memory lane so let's get to it

1014
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:06,469
[SPEAKER_03]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1015
01:30:06,929 --> 01:30:09,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1016
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and I think DarkSakura's been waiting to talk about this one for a while.

1017
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,411
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1018
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:18,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Dragon Age Inquisition.

1019
01:30:19,232 --> 01:30:21,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Now 10 years old as of December.

1020
01:30:22,593 --> 01:30:24,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah.

1021
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:25,293
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite games.

1022
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:27,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say of the modern era.

1023
01:30:30,236 --> 01:30:30,416
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1024
01:30:30,776 --> 01:30:32,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I said 10 years old.

1025
01:30:32,757 --> 01:30:34,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright, alright.

1026
01:30:35,178 --> 01:30:51,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So, at any rate, it did come out in 2014, technically November 2014, and developed by BioWare, published by Electronic Arts, and the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise.

1027
01:30:53,543 --> 01:30:58,345
[SPEAKER_05]: You play as a character called the Inquisitor, eventually called the Inquisitor,

1028
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:20,526
[SPEAKER_05]: um who gets caught up in the middle of um events coming right after Dragon Age 2 um spoilers the Chantry gets blown up there's fights between Templars and mages and kind of have to know the universe to know what that's all about and at this big conclave where they're supposed to be working out their shit um

1029
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:46,514
[SPEAKER_05]: um someone blows a hole in the sky and the inquisitor has the one means of closing it by a i guess a power surge on their hand um and i'm not going to go too far into it it's a involved game it gave us there's some very interesting fun behind the scenes facts like about uh iron bull's dick did you know about that all righty

1030
01:31:48,830 --> 01:32:10,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been to those horny parts of the internet and then I ran away screaming Usually a lot of the male characters in there are rendered, you know, Ken doll style They rendered his junk And then when it finally caught that they rendered his junk They replaced it with a big black box And you can see that when you fly cam

1031
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:12,786
[SPEAKER_05]: There.

1032
01:32:13,286 --> 01:32:14,607
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Dragon Age stuff for you.

1033
01:32:14,847 --> 01:32:16,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.

1034
01:32:16,908 --> 01:32:17,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Tidbits.

1035
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:19,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Bits.

1036
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:33,253
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, Dragon Age 2 kind of got, well, people fussed at it because they were reusing assets and it was set in one place and it didn't have a lot of the complexity that Origins did.

1037
01:32:33,753 --> 01:32:38,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the biggest improvement that that game made is having your character freaking talk.

1038
01:32:40,138 --> 01:33:01,979
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what annoyed it's kind of what annoys me in Baldur's Gate as well is not being able to like really experience the personality of your character but at any rate though a lot of that was taken into account when the game was being designed so it is an action roleplay game but

1039
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:16,407
[SPEAKER_05]: EA wanted firstly for the game to be developed in one of their own in-house engines, the Eclipse game engine, but it wouldn't have worked for an open world.

1040
01:33:16,567 --> 01:33:22,330
[SPEAKER_05]: So they used Frostbite 3 that had been used before for Battlefield, the Battlefield games.

1041
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:38,557
[SPEAKER_05]: and so they started working making multiplayer Dragon Age product called Blackfoot and then doing a bunch of work in it which led to them cancelling the Exalted March DLC intended for Dragon Age 2

1042
01:33:40,078 --> 01:33:59,373
[SPEAKER_05]: um so they they really just started you know pushing things the problem frostbite was also made for first-person games but uh it didn't have the ability to have stats game saving conversations cut scenes any of it from RPGs

1043
01:34:00,013 --> 01:34:10,522
[SPEAKER_05]: or animate like quadrupeds or certain custom characters so um they really had just a rotten time with it and then um

1044
01:34:12,515 --> 01:34:15,658
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up, though, working their way through it.

1045
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:27,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Very unstable builds of it and trying to work with that and a few other in-house tools.

1046
01:34:28,009 --> 01:34:29,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did get it out there.

1047
01:34:31,252 --> 01:34:36,876
[SPEAKER_05]: They were afraid that the popularity of mobile gaming would also hinder console game sales.

1048
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:42,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So this pushed BioWare to release it for older systems as well.

1049
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:53,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as the releases it had, it was intended just to be released for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, but there were then PS3 and Xbox 360 releases too.

1050
01:34:55,302 --> 01:34:56,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really just put...

1051
01:34:58,098 --> 01:35:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot into trying to make those games work on the earlier systems So yeah, they had some problems with it But they did manage to put out a fairly decent masterpiece, I think It was really, really good

1052
01:35:18,197 --> 01:35:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: you had wide open spaces to explore you could play different kinds of characters you had your NPCs you had your team members and a twist I'll be honest I saw it coming because I knew the lore I saw it coming the thing about Solas who is now the I'm gonna say that he's an antagonist in the current game in Veilguard but

1053
01:35:48,248 --> 01:36:17,378
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe like you have your more forceful antagonists like Ghislaine and Elgarnaan but he's like the overarching antagonist but he's also like not an antagonist in the fact that he's a very complicated character and that's really what a lot of people called out is that in Dragon Age Inquisition you had this very complicated character everybody was complicated they had their own motivations their own things going on

1054
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:39,169
[SPEAKER_05]: and they didn't always all get along like a lot of the dialogue between certain characters is just absolutely perfect for how hard they snap on each other but this built off of something that came from DLC for Dragon Age 2 where they had found like one of the old uh

1055
01:36:40,269 --> 01:36:55,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Magisters who were responsible for the blight coming into the world and now he wants to you know he's come out of the fade and he wants to go back and make himself a god so of course that's bad news for everybody and you see some returning characters like

1056
01:36:56,098 --> 01:36:59,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You can bring back Hawk, your hero from Dragon Age 2.

1057
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:07,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Cassandra, who was interrogating the shit out of Varric during Dragon Age 2, comes back, as does he.

1058
01:37:08,501 --> 01:37:10,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Liliana from the first game.

1059
01:37:11,021 --> 01:37:13,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she showed up in two, briefly.

1060
01:37:13,682 --> 01:37:15,162
[SPEAKER_05]: You even see Alistar.

1061
01:37:15,342 --> 01:37:17,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You see a lot of people.

1062
01:37:17,322 --> 01:37:19,483
[SPEAKER_05]: There's references back to the Warden if they lived.

1063
01:37:20,383 --> 01:37:21,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Morrigan is in the game.

1064
01:37:22,123 --> 01:37:25,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a lot of characters coming back and

1065
01:37:26,304 --> 01:37:40,758
[SPEAKER_05]: it was really there was some pretty fun fan service in there for people and they remembered their lore they got it right um they this it had what I wished Veilguard had been able to maintain um

1066
01:37:42,245 --> 01:38:09,782
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of drama with Veilguard including laying off some of the writers for the game but we'll go back so anyway they were able to get different artists to come in for some of the background art elements including the character cards and in-game artwork statues, all kinds of things

1067
01:38:10,722 --> 01:38:24,014
[SPEAKER_05]: and they did have a pretty decent character AI for your companions when they fought, but you could also move them around and assign tasks to them.

1068
01:38:24,974 --> 01:38:27,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, you could play different classes and different characters.

1069
01:38:27,897 --> 01:38:32,280
[SPEAKER_05]: You could play a Dalish elf, you could play a human noble.

1070
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:37,445
[SPEAKER_05]: You could play a kunari, you could play a dwarf.

1071
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:41,529
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also, I think, the first game you could play a kunari as a player character in.

1072
01:38:43,871 --> 01:38:48,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you had, you know, your mages, you had your rogues, and you had your warriors.

1073
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:50,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all really good.

1074
01:38:50,777 --> 01:38:53,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the character in this one was very well done.

1075
01:38:54,180 --> 01:39:01,068
[SPEAKER_05]: and it picked up all the pieces left over from the previous ones.

1076
01:39:02,329 --> 01:39:08,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And while you get Hawkback, they were saying that they didn't bring the Warden from Dragon Age Origins in because

1077
01:39:10,686 --> 01:39:12,387
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, there was no established voice.

1078
01:39:14,588 --> 01:39:25,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't have a means in there to make a character that would resemble their version origins, which I think is, I mean, they could have done something.

1079
01:39:26,455 --> 01:39:48,645
[SPEAKER_05]: and the warden was going to appear in the Here Lies the Abyss quest with Hawk but they cut that out in development so they actually had a crime reporter inspect all of the Dragon Age media to be sure that Inquisition hadn't deviated from the lore and

1080
01:39:49,085 --> 01:39:56,108
[SPEAKER_05]: and they even had their own internal wiki to keep track of their characters and all the lore which I think is hilarious.

1081
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:08,112
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a gift system in the game to make friends and romance people and make friends or push people away and punch soulless which was in there.

1082
01:40:09,133 --> 01:40:26,296
[SPEAKER_05]: um there was an approval bar but they removed it because they wanted it to be more subtle a little bit more real life um they they were as far as romances too they were focusing on characters um

1083
01:40:27,182 --> 01:40:27,783
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

1084
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Dorian.

1085
01:40:46,971 --> 01:40:50,898
[SPEAKER_05]: He is their first fully gay male character.

1086
01:40:50,998 --> 01:40:53,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah was their first full lesbian character to my knowledge.

1087
01:40:54,865 --> 01:40:57,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that you had people that

1088
01:40:58,756 --> 01:41:21,734
[SPEAKER_05]: were who they were does that make sense what I'm saying about that yeah they just they were although I would have loved to have had an ace character you know just saying but I think that that it was it was really good the way it was handled they had a trans character who was handled perfectly and voiced by Jennifer Hale I'm just gonna say this right now long live Krem um

1089
01:41:23,376 --> 01:41:47,080
[SPEAKER_05]: just amazing amazing and the the music in the game was pretty pretty awesome um they had a new composer Trevor Morris um to bring in a different as they say emotional flavor to to the game um they did high uh quality dynamic audio so they wanted it to be

1090
01:41:47,900 --> 01:42:16,575
[SPEAKER_05]: very immersive and they were using the audio functionality in Frostbite to accomplish that so they also removed some tasks that included tagging animations and sound emitters so that they could focus on producing the high quality sound that they wanted to but a lot of the story moments for audio programming was scripted by hand

1091
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:38,721
[SPEAKER_05]: There were songs that were made for a character named Meriden Halliwell, who was voiced by Elizaveta Kriponova, who was a bard in the game, like an actual musical bard.

1092
01:42:39,621 --> 01:43:04,966
[SPEAKER_05]: and so in fact her songs were actually so popular that they did the Bard songs that you could download between January 26, 2015 and February 9, 2015 but they are available elsewhere they marketed the shit out of the game I had been waiting for this the really neat thing that this one had was the Dragon Age Keep

1093
01:43:06,178 --> 01:43:15,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could go back and instead of like a save file migration, it was very, very in-depth.

1094
01:43:15,588 --> 01:43:20,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You could make your whole major decisions that would have affected the game.

1095
01:43:20,693 --> 01:43:24,697
[SPEAKER_05]: You can bring them over by creating them in the keep and then importing that into your game.

1096
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:32,944
[SPEAKER_05]: and in the keep you could also access Dragon Age The Last Court which is a companion game although it's been deactivated since 2020.

1097
01:43:33,004 --> 01:43:41,570
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a minigame called The Quest for the Lead Lyrium Reapers that was on the Dragon Age Inquisition website.

1098
01:43:43,051 --> 01:43:50,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Different promotional rewards in the minigame and then you could get it in a special delivery chest on patch 11 in October 2015.

1099
01:43:50,977 --> 01:43:53,079
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a golden Nug statue and

1100
01:43:53,859 --> 01:44:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: that if you've already completed the playthrough you could synchronize your collections of items to bring them over kind of a new game plus-ish and then there were the digital deluxe editions you get the OST and different in-game items like a throne made out of a dragon skull that was cool they had DLC, the Jaws of Hakkon which was really fun and definitely threw a wrench into some of the established lore that people thought was there um

1101
01:44:23,206 --> 01:44:30,277
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the Black Emporium came out for free which is also present in Veilguard 2 for exclusive items.

1102
01:44:31,379 --> 01:44:36,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the one that let you have the Mirror of Transformation so you could change the appearance of your Inquisitor which is now just, you know,

1103
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:38,977
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Lighthouse in Veilguard.

1104
01:44:40,798 --> 01:44:47,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were working on ways to transfer your save games to newer hardwares.

1105
01:44:48,182 --> 01:44:55,687
[SPEAKER_05]: The spoils of the Avvar had new in-game items, schematics, customization options, just all kinds of stuff.

1106
01:44:55,747 --> 01:45:03,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last DLC, Trespasser, was basically set two years after the game and is...

1107
01:45:05,052 --> 01:45:08,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's like, what the hell happened with Solas?

1108
01:45:09,394 --> 01:45:11,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1109
01:45:12,295 --> 01:45:19,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty good, and I think was the nice ending to that story and the setup for Veilguard.

1110
01:45:21,138 --> 01:45:27,619
[SPEAKER_05]: This game won amazing kudos from various facilities.

1111
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:37,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not get any lower than an 8 out of 10 from any reviewer, or no less than 4 stars.

1112
01:45:38,982 --> 01:45:43,803
[SPEAKER_05]: The highest score, there's a 5 out of 5 from Joystick and 9.5 out of 10 from Polygon.

1113
01:45:46,243 --> 01:45:51,965
[SPEAKER_05]: People were saying that it was fun and colorful and that the expansion really brought a lot to the game.

1114
01:45:53,546 --> 01:46:00,908
[SPEAKER_05]: They thought that some of the story was a little bit more by the books, but it felt like there was...

1115
01:46:02,615 --> 01:46:28,058
[SPEAKER_05]: more than what could have gone on but there was a lot of potential for more to happen and there were people who thought it didn't have the heart of the previous games but still it offered like actual decisions that you would stop and agonize over and that really showed their effect in the rest of the game that you played I mean you have one right at the start for like who you're going to side with the mages or templars um

1116
01:46:28,818 --> 01:46:48,728
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was a fully realized world it was really really big you know you go all kinds of places and you would always find things to explore and you had to kind of learn your way around just like you know you were new like you were new to an area um it was it debuted at number five in the UK on its first launch week

1117
01:46:50,929 --> 01:46:54,670
[SPEAKER_05]: and sold almost exact amount as Dragon Age 2 did.

1118
01:46:56,231 --> 01:47:00,792
[SPEAKER_05]: It was considered the most successful launch in Bioware history based on units sold.

1119
01:47:01,413 --> 01:47:11,017
[SPEAKER_05]: As of September of this year the game sold over 12 million units in its lifetime which surpassed anything the EA had projected.

1120
01:47:11,497 --> 01:47:14,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It was to that date Bioware's best selling title.

1121
01:47:16,039 --> 01:47:16,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Awards.

1122
01:47:16,979 --> 01:47:22,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nominated for Best PC Game and won Best RPG at the Game Critics Award.

1123
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:26,443
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Awards 2014 won Best Roleplaying and Game of the Year.

1124
01:47:27,183 --> 01:47:32,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Dice Awards Game of the Year and Best Roleplaying MMO Game of the Year.

1125
01:47:34,186 --> 01:47:43,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It's won Game of the Year just from a bunch of different awards and won a Special Recognition Award by the 26th Annual GLAAD Media Awards.

1126
01:47:45,984 --> 01:48:09,660
[SPEAKER_05]: well done there I'm not going to go too much more into Veilguard but this game is absolutely amazing I still go back and revisit my characters from time to time I modded the shit out of my game yeah it was great and

1127
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:40,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say enough good things about it I thoroughly thought I've probably beaten that game a dozen times I have all kinds and I always like the first time I played it I did do the soulless romance so when I played Veilguard I brought over that Inquisitor like you don't get nearly the customization in Veilguard and I'm disappointed by that but every other playthrough I found my Garrus and it's Cullen even though his voice actor is an ass

1128
01:48:42,051 --> 01:49:04,903
[SPEAKER_05]: but that that he's my Garrus in this game I have him a Bari plushie I have a Nug plushie well you've beat this 12 times oh yeah his politics are bullshit bullshit he's a turf um you've beat this game 12 times meanwhile I'm still stuck in the hinterlands um so you know that's

1129
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:19,507
[SPEAKER_05]: different experiences but you have Scout Harding and she's adorable and then you can play with her in Velguard yeah, I do need to go back and actually finish this game someday we'll just add that to the list of things to do

1130
01:49:20,819 --> 01:49:27,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, Gareth David Lloyd played Solas, and you know what else he was in for our Doctor Who fans?

1131
01:49:27,741 --> 01:49:31,022
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in Torchwood as Ianto Jones.

1132
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:36,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, joining... Yep, PodCulture knows it.

1133
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:40,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And then joining Eve Miles, who played Meryl in Dragon Age 2.

1134
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:53,206
[SPEAKER_05]: so so yeah oh and this was the last game to feature Flemeth and you know who voiced her?

1135
01:49:55,107 --> 01:50:12,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Kate Mulgrew oh shoot okay nice yeah so yeah really really really good stuff lots of tie-ins for a lot of other franchises that we love but yeah so the game is Dragon Age Inquisition alright

1136
01:50:13,157 --> 01:50:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Good pick, even if it falls into the hole.

1137
01:50:15,218 --> 01:50:17,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe that's 10 years old.

1138
01:50:18,839 --> 01:50:19,399
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is.

1139
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:23,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since it's been kind of shoved down my throat that it's 10 years old, I think I can very well believe it.

1140
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:24,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

1141
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:25,520
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1142
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Age Inquisition, your classic game of the week.

1143
01:50:28,481 --> 01:50:32,682
[SPEAKER_06]: We have just a few more headlines we're going to run through quickly in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

1144
01:50:32,982 --> 01:50:34,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, we'll go to you first.

1145
01:50:35,768 --> 01:50:49,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, so we have some DLC coming out for a mod for Fallout London.

1146
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:56,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so they have three pieces of DLC that are coming out later this year, so that's pretty awesome.

1147
01:50:56,612 --> 01:51:04,233
[SPEAKER_08]: You already get essentially a total conversion on the game, and then they're adding what was previously cut content and some stuff that they're adding.

1148
01:51:06,345 --> 01:51:08,707
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1149
01:51:29,484 --> 01:51:49,733
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever reason they replace all the spiders with Astro Bot and it's funny because they actually play like the Astro Bot theme song as it's going so they're kind of charging towards you and stuff but it's certainly a lot cuter than the actual spiders in game so I thought that was kind of funny that's cute, I like that idea DarkSakura, what do you have?

1150
01:51:50,753 --> 01:51:54,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I did just come up with what I'm going to do for my one-off game

1151
01:51:56,063 --> 01:51:56,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Game of the Week.

1152
01:51:58,065 --> 01:51:59,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's going to be weird, but fun.

1153
01:51:59,706 --> 01:52:00,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in a good way.

1154
01:52:00,507 --> 01:52:01,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird in a good way.

1155
01:52:02,168 --> 01:52:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, like the Action 52 and stuff like that.

1156
01:52:05,451 --> 01:52:06,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1157
01:52:06,132 --> 01:52:06,512
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1158
01:52:06,792 --> 01:52:07,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1159
01:52:07,233 --> 01:52:07,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm into it.

1160
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:09,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

1161
01:52:10,929 --> 01:52:18,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Squinnix put out a questionnaire asking what input fans had for the future of the Final Fantasy series.

1162
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a 10-15 minute Final Fantasy questionnaire.

1163
01:52:23,757 --> 01:52:33,262
[SPEAKER_05]: They posted this on the site that I don't visit, but I will see about copying the link and putting it here in our chat if anyone's interested.

1164
01:52:36,364 --> 01:52:37,565
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think that

1165
01:52:38,206 --> 01:52:39,008
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to hear us.

1166
01:52:39,348 --> 01:52:40,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not answer?

1167
01:52:41,572 --> 01:52:44,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And here, I'll put it there so you don't have to go on to the site that shall not be named.

1168
01:52:46,485 --> 01:52:47,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1169
01:52:48,726 --> 01:52:50,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And how about a Fortnite story?

1170
01:52:51,007 --> 01:53:06,253
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Cyberpunk 2077 is making its way to Fortnite with Johnny Silverhand, that of course is Keanu Reeves' character, and V, the female character from the game, are coming over to Fortnite.

1171
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:12,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it went live earlier this week, and you can get the characters and accessories and all that stuff.

1172
01:53:12,576 --> 01:53:14,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, there you go.

1173
01:53:16,397 --> 01:53:17,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we surprised?

1174
01:53:17,258 --> 01:53:22,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, because CD Projekt Red has done other things through Unreal and all that.

1175
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:29,124
[SPEAKER_06]: The first trailer for The Witcher 4 is in Unreal, and we've had characters from The Witcher series that have shown up in the game before.

1176
01:53:29,964 --> 01:53:34,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Also interesting to note, this is Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite.

1177
01:53:35,567 --> 01:53:38,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can do Johnny Silverhand versus John Wick.

1178
01:53:39,875 --> 01:54:07,671
[SPEAKER_06]: by the way can I talk about John Wick for a minute because I was on a flight back from Nashville and I wasn't really you know I was kind of like in and out of sleep and sometimes if I'm really bored and zoning out I'll just kind of notice what the person in front of me is watching on their TV and they were definitely watching John Wick which I had never seen before or knew anything about but and I couldn't tell you what the plot was because you don't hear the audio because they have headphones on but I was like is this movie's plot is literally if Johnny or excuse me if

1179
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:13,314
[SPEAKER_06]: If Keanu Reeves does not shoot somebody through the face every 15 seconds, the movie ends.

1180
01:54:13,914 --> 01:54:16,015
[SPEAKER_06]: That is very clearly what John Wick is.

1181
01:54:17,156 --> 01:54:18,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, are you a big fan of John Wick?

1182
01:54:19,857 --> 01:54:22,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only seen the first one, I think.

1183
01:54:22,098 --> 01:54:23,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Just struck me as a Loki movie.

1184
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're good.

1185
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:27,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I like them.

1186
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:30,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just shooting people over and over and over again.

1187
01:54:30,522 --> 01:54:31,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Shooting people.

1188
01:54:31,103 --> 01:54:32,443
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all that movie is.

1189
01:54:34,745 --> 01:54:35,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, pretty much.

1190
01:54:36,986 --> 01:54:37,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1191
01:54:38,936 --> 01:55:02,266
[SPEAKER_06]: but now you can do Keanu Reeves versus Keanu Reeves in Fortnite and I'm sure many fanfic writers will have a field day with that, enjoy alright, with that that is all of the stories that we have, but we do have some release dates, maybe this is like last week, probably a terrible week for release dates but we will check in with the world anyway so Loki, we'll go to you first

1192
01:55:03,824 --> 01:55:04,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's not much.

1193
01:55:05,665 --> 01:55:09,166
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really only one game that's weathering waves on PlayStation 5.

1194
01:55:09,746 --> 01:55:10,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Weathering waves.

1195
01:55:10,826 --> 01:55:12,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what... Weathering waves.

1196
01:55:12,187 --> 01:55:13,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Weathering waves.

1197
01:55:13,247 --> 01:55:14,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1198
01:55:15,068 --> 01:55:18,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Traveling to Japan, I do not see anything on the Switch this week.

1199
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:22,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the PlayStation 5, I don't see anything either.

1200
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:28,872
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really have games coming out in Japan again until Ys is coming out, I believe, in the new year.

1201
01:55:29,552 --> 01:55:30,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's it.

1202
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:33,374
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's actually not even a Japanese release.

1203
01:55:33,415 --> 01:55:33,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1204
01:55:34,195 --> 01:55:36,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are showing other regions.

1205
01:55:36,977 --> 01:55:41,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Freedom Wars looks like the first release on PlayStation 5 in the new year on the 9th of January.

1206
01:55:42,181 --> 01:55:43,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a little ways to go.

1207
01:55:44,503 --> 01:55:45,984
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, same story in the UK?

1208
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:49,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just two things.

1209
01:55:49,667 --> 01:55:55,152
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Resident Evil 2 remake for iOS and Mac.

1210
01:55:56,728 --> 01:56:04,092
[SPEAKER_05]: and on January 1st, Wuthering Waves 2.0 for PS5.

1211
01:56:05,472 --> 01:56:07,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks in chat talking about Wuthering Waves.

1212
01:56:07,834 --> 01:56:11,555
[SPEAKER_06]: QuestBuster says it's like a sci-fi Genshin Impact, if that helps.

1213
01:56:14,157 --> 01:56:15,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Deft says, if anything, it is free to play.

1214
01:56:18,058 --> 01:56:21,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games have gotten a lot of fans that way, that's for sure.

1215
01:56:22,352 --> 01:56:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, now we go to the listener roundtable.

1216
01:56:25,655 --> 01:56:31,240
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to give us a call, we have our Discord open over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.

1217
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:34,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I would encourage you to join the Discord and chat with us throughout the week as well.

1218
01:56:35,444 --> 01:56:43,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You can email us as well, participate at orangelondrader.com, but I think I caught before the show that we don't have any emails tonight, right?

1219
01:56:44,335 --> 01:56:47,418
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1220
01:57:07,957 --> 01:57:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and the first one is from Fifth Dream, who is saying games we wanted to play this year and just didn't.

1221
01:57:17,322 --> 01:57:19,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure this is a big list for many people.

1222
01:57:19,684 --> 01:57:22,105
[SPEAKER_06]: A game you wanted to play this year and just didn't.

1223
01:57:22,465 --> 01:57:26,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start because mine is a whopper because I kind of can't believe I didn't get around to it.

1224
01:57:27,088 --> 01:57:29,729
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, this is going to surprise some of you because I bought the game.

1225
01:57:29,749 --> 01:57:30,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I still haven't played it.

1226
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:32,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

1227
01:57:35,635 --> 01:57:53,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I just I got distracted I played other things one of these days I'll get around to playing it but yeah it's one that I fully I wanted to play it this year and I just I just didn't that's the topic I can't think of anything I think I've played everything that I was interested in

1228
01:57:55,322 --> 01:57:56,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what about for you?

1229
01:57:56,082 --> 01:57:57,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I even played What the Fog.

1230
01:57:59,124 --> 01:58:03,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there wasn't really much that I was looking forward to playing this year.

1231
01:58:05,007 --> 01:58:08,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto 6, no, but that'll be next year at this point.

1232
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:11,531
[SPEAKER_08]: No, nothing that actually came out.

1233
01:58:12,812 --> 01:58:13,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1234
01:58:14,052 --> 01:58:20,416
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing really that I didn't play that I didn't, I guess.

1235
01:58:21,888 --> 01:58:25,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy maybe, but I wouldn't have played that anyways because I haven't finished the first one.

1236
01:58:27,432 --> 01:58:29,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I played everything.

1237
01:58:31,578 --> 01:58:58,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Pod Culture says a new OLR dream game which is funny because we kind of got into that earlier in the show and I said hold on because I think we have a bleed about this and so here's the thing is that with OLR dream games usually they're best thought up on the spot you know it's hard for us to kind of say you know I feel like when we're kind of hand molding something that doesn't come up in natural conversation it's not really an OLR dream game but we did get

1238
01:58:58,982 --> 01:59:21,296
[SPEAKER_06]: the you know president cat in space earlier so um I don't know I'd probably go with that for me I don't know if my co-hosts want to chime in on that but all right well then we have one more uh from Dark Tetsuya who says we got a PlayStation 5 for Christmas and funny enough one of our

1239
01:59:22,301 --> 01:59:24,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Fast Favorites is the Pinball FX line.

1240
01:59:25,403 --> 01:59:28,584
[SPEAKER_06]: So any recommended tables to pick up are greatly appreciated.

1241
01:59:29,005 --> 01:59:32,326
[SPEAKER_06]: We did just get the latest Williams pack featuring Black Knight 2000.

1242
01:59:33,247 --> 01:59:33,987
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tough one.

1243
01:59:35,328 --> 01:59:38,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Shucks, I have to remember what tables are even in Pinball FX.

1244
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:42,432
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I'm not mistaken, you know, Pinball FX has some of the old classics.

1245
01:59:42,912 --> 01:59:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think... Oh my God, I'm blanking on the names.

1246
01:59:49,822 --> 01:59:51,323
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this one, DarkSakura.

1247
01:59:51,523 --> 01:59:52,344
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two of them.

1248
01:59:52,424 --> 01:59:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the one with the spinning lamp, Tales from... Arabian Nights?

1249
01:59:58,369 --> 01:59:59,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Arabian Nights, that one.

1250
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:01,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was called Tales for some reason.

1251
02:00:01,132 --> 02:00:02,233
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Papaduke one, I think.

1252
02:00:02,273 --> 02:00:07,497
[SPEAKER_06]: That one, and then the one that's very similar with the big escape case in it, the magic game.

1253
02:00:08,778 --> 02:00:09,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Theater of Magic?

1254
02:00:09,419 --> 02:00:10,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Theater of Magic, that one.

1255
02:00:11,001 --> 02:00:11,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't I remember these names?

1256
02:00:11,781 --> 02:00:13,382
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean the one that I have in my dining room?

1257
02:00:13,402 --> 02:00:15,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yeah, I can't remember the names.

1258
02:00:15,184 --> 02:00:16,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'm getting old.

1259
02:00:16,064 --> 02:00:16,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting to that age.

1260
02:00:16,885 --> 02:00:18,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Melody's Favorite Pinball?

1261
02:00:18,586 --> 02:00:19,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Theater of Magic, yes.

1262
02:00:20,047 --> 02:00:26,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Those would be, I think those are like just, because what I like about those games too is that they don't really tie into any other property.

1263
02:00:26,931 --> 02:00:33,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, sure, the Addams Family table is great, you know, but like those tables just kind of really speak for themselves.

1264
02:00:33,735 --> 02:00:34,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

1265
02:00:34,776 --> 02:00:45,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But DarkSakura, I don't know if you have... I know that you've got the real deal in your house, but Pinball FX is a much cheaper way to get into pinball.

1266
02:00:45,404 --> 02:00:47,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you have any recommendations for tables to check out.

1267
02:00:50,588 --> 02:00:52,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what all is on Pinball FX.

1268
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:56,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I could look at the list real quick and see if there's anything.

1269
02:00:57,013 --> 02:00:58,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, definitely Theater of Magic.

1270
02:00:58,994 --> 02:01:00,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Arabian Nights is also a really good one.

1271
02:01:01,476 --> 02:01:02,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Is World Cup on there?

1272
02:01:03,502 --> 02:01:04,643
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says World Cup is on there, really?

1273
02:01:28,599 --> 02:01:52,485
[SPEAKER_05]: World Cup is a really good one that is my absolute favorite pinball Rocky and Bullwinkle I think is on there which was the first one that we owned I want to say I cannot find the list of games that are on it pinball FX game list

1274
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:55,742
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a ton of them at this point.

1275
02:01:56,662 --> 02:01:58,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of naming random tables because there's a ton of them.

1276
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:05,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just figure there's a really good chance most of the big ones from the 90s and after, unless there's a big licensing issue.

1277
02:02:07,025 --> 02:02:10,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't see any of it.

1278
02:02:10,527 --> 02:02:16,289
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, if you see something on there and you want to ask me about it, message me.

1279
02:02:16,829 --> 02:02:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you.

1280
02:02:18,509 --> 02:02:20,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and my husband would recommend Elvira Scared Stiff.

1281
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:21,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's his favorite.

1282
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:22,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Scared Stiff, definitely.

1283
02:02:25,064 --> 02:02:37,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, World Cup is still my favorite Alright, well if you want to bleed us throughout the week, at Orange Entredo is the place to reach us on Blue Sky But with that, hey, we still filled out You know what?

1284
02:02:37,618 --> 02:02:37,778
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1285
02:02:39,181 --> 02:02:43,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I like Bleat either because it sounds too much like Tweet, which sounds too much like the other site.

1286
02:02:44,183 --> 02:02:46,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Post.

1287
02:02:47,104 --> 02:02:51,086
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually the official line, too, from Blue Skies, that they're called Posts.

1288
02:02:51,866 --> 02:02:54,207
[SPEAKER_06]: To which everybody will always reply, no, they're Skeets.

1289
02:02:54,887 --> 02:02:55,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1290
02:02:55,948 --> 02:02:58,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever came up with that bullshit, because that's terrible.

1291
02:02:59,349 --> 02:03:03,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well with that, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lingerie.

1292
02:03:03,211 --> 02:03:04,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, wait, I should check in.

1293
02:03:04,291 --> 02:03:06,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt there are, but I'm going to check with Loki if there's any last minute stories.

1294
02:03:08,396 --> 02:03:08,616
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1295
02:03:08,736 --> 02:03:09,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a feeling that would be the case.

1296
02:03:10,437 --> 02:03:14,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, thank you as always for listening to another episode of Orange Dawn Radio.

1297
02:03:14,178 --> 02:03:17,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for participating with our show tonight, especially throughout the holidays.

[SPEAKER_06]: We hope you had a lovely holiday period.

1299
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:22,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe it's going to be 2025 next week.

1300
02:03:22,981 --> 02:03:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you all have a very happy and safe new year, however you're choosing to celebrate.

1301
02:03:27,183 --> 02:03:27,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of wonky.

1302
02:03:27,883 --> 02:03:33,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the middle of the week, but hey, hope you're able to celebrate anyway and have fun with it and enjoy games.

1303
02:03:33,185 --> 02:03:35,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy catching up on your backlog like I'm trying to do.

1304
02:03:35,806 --> 02:03:40,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1305
02:03:40,148 --> 02:03:41,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Please follow us there.

1306
02:03:41,148 --> 02:03:42,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Please follow us in the Discord server.

[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we have our YouTube channel where you can always find the shows.

1308
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:48,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend.

1309
02:03:48,811 --> 02:03:52,792
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the word, or we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1310
02:03:53,512 --> 02:03:57,194
[SPEAKER_06]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, um,

1311
02:03:58,945 --> 02:04:00,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's not iTunes anymore.

1312
02:04:00,105 --> 02:04:01,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just Apple Podcasts is what they call it now.

1313
02:04:01,766 --> 02:04:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show, those five-star reviews have gone an awful long way, and we really do appreciate them.

1314
02:04:10,389 --> 02:04:11,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you so much.

1315
02:04:11,049 --> 02:04:12,569
[SPEAKER_04]: iTunes hasn't existed for like a year now.

1316
02:04:12,849 --> 02:04:13,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1317
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: It's habit, right?

1318
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:17,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You memorize the spiel, and habits are hard to break.

1319
02:04:18,051 --> 02:04:19,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I still call it iTunes even if it's not.

1320
02:04:19,492 --> 02:04:19,732
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1321
02:04:21,926 --> 02:04:22,386
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1322
02:04:22,746 --> 02:04:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.

1323
02:04:24,848 --> 02:04:26,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf will be back next week.

1324
02:04:26,408 --> 02:04:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back next week.

1325
02:04:27,629 --> 02:04:34,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And since it will be the first show of the year, I think we ought to open up our 2024 predictions and see how that went.

1326
02:04:34,533 --> 02:04:37,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do that next week.

1327
02:04:37,774 --> 02:04:40,136
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do our game of the years of 2024 as well.

1328
02:04:40,316 --> 02:04:40,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we can.

1329
02:04:40,936 --> 02:04:42,317
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have any, sure, we can do them.

1330
02:04:44,273 --> 02:04:52,116
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll talk about that alright, with that let's wrap up so DarkSakura, I'm assuming you are streaming as always tonight?

1331
02:04:53,176 --> 02:05:04,780
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, I'm gonna go back and do DBD I wanna finish the Bone Chill stuff I might play some Killer if no one's gonna join me alright, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1332
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:09,601
[SPEAKER_01]: um reject false icons?

1333
02:05:10,782 --> 02:05:12,062
[SPEAKER_01]: why not go with an old classic?

1334
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:26,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, also, it never dawns on me that my mom is in her 60s until she tells me that she needs to get a, quote, smart TV.

1335
02:05:29,715 --> 02:05:30,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like the dumb TV.

1336
02:05:34,837 --> 02:05:37,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, Mom, it's not hard.

1337
02:05:38,829 --> 02:05:44,653
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what gets me is when people who I consider to be in my age group are tech challenged.

1338
02:05:44,693 --> 02:05:46,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I can do this.

1339
02:05:47,055 --> 02:05:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like, you know, I'm here for people, but would it kill people to read a manual?

1340
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:53,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it kill you to read a manual?

1341
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: RTFM, read the fucking manual.

1342
02:05:56,822 --> 02:05:57,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in pain.

1343
02:05:59,684 --> 02:06:01,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in emotional pain.

1344
02:06:02,406 --> 02:06:03,606
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, get to streaming.

1345
02:06:03,626 --> 02:06:04,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in a little bit.

1346
02:06:05,248 --> 02:06:06,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm internally screaming right now.

1347
02:06:07,512 --> 02:06:08,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, kids!

1348
02:06:08,614 --> 02:06:09,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodnight.

1349
02:06:09,195 --> 02:06:09,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1350
02:06:10,438 --> 02:06:12,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki, we'll go to you and your final thoughts tonight.

1351
02:06:13,463 --> 02:06:15,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just still working on the Minecraft stuff.

1352
02:06:15,507 --> 02:06:19,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I'll have that done soon so I can finally put out my episode and end the season.

1353
02:06:21,791 --> 02:06:47,287
[SPEAKER_06]: and my final thought is I will be streaming this week I just don't know when and I think I'm going to play a game I've been talking about for a long time it's my first game I want to beat for 2025 so I'm kind of coming up with a mental list of all the games I want to play so hopefully I can beat them that's the thing where I'm like oh god has my skill regressed a lot but I may do some games not in hardcore mode so I can just save state my way like I think at some point in the year

1354
02:06:47,867 --> 02:06:49,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to do Blaster Master.

1355
02:06:49,187 --> 02:06:49,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't be first.

1356
02:06:50,028 --> 02:06:51,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to save state that one.

1357
02:06:51,968 --> 02:06:54,549
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is too harsh when you're done.

1358
02:06:54,589 --> 02:06:56,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is no battery.

1359
02:06:56,710 --> 02:06:59,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to do it all in one sitting, which is not going to happen.

1360
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:00,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to have to do a save states in that.

1361
02:07:01,411 --> 02:07:03,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll have to opt to bend.

1362
02:07:03,852 --> 02:07:08,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say I won't beat them without using some of the modern things, but I'm going to try to use them sparingly.

1363
02:07:09,213 --> 02:07:09,473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1364
02:07:10,914 --> 02:07:11,214
