40356	42938	Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.
42978	48063	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48183	50565	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50625	54529	We are live once again back after a little bit of a long break there.
54909	58692	December the 22nd of 2024 for tonight and 1028 episodes in as of tonight's show.
58713	60174	We do tape live every Sunday night.
65038	72220	at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
72400	77041	Except for tonight, Bobby is off for the holidays, doing holiday-related things.
77121	80342	But we are here, again, after an unexpected little break there.
80402	81842	Well, some expected, some unexpected.
81862	82382	We'll get into it.
82422	86603	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
89484	89724	Hi.
89944	90244	Hi.
90404	90964	How are you doing?
92789	94671	I found the ferret again and I love him.
95431	97173	You've had an interesting couple of weeks.
98354	100617	Good lord, it's exhausting.
101538	106082	But I did buy myself something today that completely sums up everything.
106302	106723	What's that?
107584	108224	It's a plushie.
109395	133902	of a dumpster fire perfect perfect this is I'm fine everything's fine and it has this wide-eyed flat smile on it perfect I will send a picture perfect um so yeah to kind of address what's happened so we've been off for two weeks one week was planned and one week wasn't so last week um I was in Nashville and I knew I was going to be there I was there for an Ingress event mainly but
134122	135983	Honestly, that was a little bit of it.
136043	139504	And then it was hanging out with my old friend, Johnny, who also plays Ingress and was there.
139584	141744	So we had a gay old time in Nashville.
141824	142284	It was fun.
142744	143205	It was good.
143305	144285	So that was last week.
144305	145485	We knew we weren't going to be here that week.
146005	150987	Unfortunately, what happened two weeks ago, I was really sick.
151287	154208	Alan was sick right before Thanksgiving.
154568	156668	He had a really bad cough type of thing.
156768	159589	And 10 days into him being sick, I got sick.
159669	160789	Except I didn't have a cough.
161310	162070	I had like...
162870	164912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
181531	181751	Paxlovid
203297	203978	Paxlovid, yeah.
204038	205940	I was thinking of Provigil, which is something else I take.
206401	207542	But no, it was the Paxlovid.
207642	212287	It made me, like, nauseous and have, like, crazy-ass hot flashes.
212427	213969	Paxlovid's the dirty penny drug.
214529	215290	Or at least for me.
216331	218914	It didn't give me the bad taste, but it gave it to Dan.
218954	220236	Dan also had the vids.
220256	220596	Uh-huh.
221497	247780	and then I had the I'm still dealing with the post-covid exhaustion but I also had my ballet recital yesterday that went um um I'm a little angry over it sorry um and really exhausted and sore and then um yeah I also not to go into too much detail um but a sharp thing went through my right hand ring finger which is also my enter key finger at the top cut about an inch
248440	255104	with a very deep gouge in the center and I had to have a stitch in my finger and I'm going to be pulling the stitch out tomorrow now that it stopped bleeding.
255544	255744	Ouch.
256044	263048	And that affects the gaming because when you hurt the finger, that means no controller, even the keyboard gets a little... Controllers are fine.
263469	264209	I can use a controller.
264289	264749	Oh, that's good.
264909	267331	It's the keyboard because that's my enter key.
267651	267851	Yeah.
268612	268692	Okay.
268832	276176	And also, every so often when I'm playing Dead by Daylight, I switch to my middle two fingers to let my index finger rest.
276196	276416	Mm-hmm.
278181	286063	So, yeah, I'm off the DVD until The Stitch comes out, which I thought I was going to be okay to play tonight.
286683	294965	But since I don't have ballet tomorrow, I'm going to play a little bit tomorrow, and I'm going to try to pull The Stitch out tomorrow.
295745	300906	It's going into a crazy house downsizing of crap.
301226	301346	Mm-hmm.
301926	302346	and you know what?
302547	303507	I got a lot of crap.
303968	305809	I have some rearranging to do too.
305969	314476	Actually, for this thing behind me here, I have this because of course we are a podcast so not everybody can see the video but I have a small little baby Ms.
314516	319640	Pac-Man arcade one up and I've actually for a couple weeks now had like a baby Mega Man machine.
319680	322141	It's an Evercade machine that's a very similar sort of thing.
322962	324383	I just needed a shelf to put it on.
324463	330408	I finally bought said shelf at Ikea over the weekend so that's my Christmas project is to build that
330768	359092	and get that all taken care of I need to go to Ikea and get one of the Billy bookshelves the media sized ones to do a wall of pops I think I can get one to fit right behind my door and I'm going to take every one of these 50 bajillion pops that are all over the floor and my ceiling on top of my big huge ass Kallax shelf and all my other stuff and they're going on a freaking Billy shelf
360273	362294	I like arcade machine thingy you got though Small Shay is formerly Shayla TTV
384588	411554	but small Shay is small well I have small house it's very fitting for a small Shay why I can't have more um I have a California small house and that's why I can't have more arcade machines sadly all right let's say hello Shay is little sis I I'm sorry to keep ignoring not on purpose but hello to Techmaster Loki how are you doing hello hopefully hopefully cootie free and um slash uh wound free and all that good stuff hopefully hopefully your last two weeks have been more pleasant than ours
412541	441057	so far yeah okay so far well who knows maybe who knows you know maybe maybe Santa will bring you COVID for Christmas who knows uh I hope not but I hope not it wouldn't be the worst thing is the flu um also I see you've got Bellatro playing behind you uh as we are taping live tonight did you finally did you finally fall down this hole of Bellatro I have oh okay okay what'd you think
442096	442456	It's good.
442516	442916	It's fun.
443117	444998	Yeah.
445718	447899	I tried to get into it, but I don't know.
447939	449120	I had a hard time getting into it.
449240	450901	Like, I just need to give it another shot.
451681	458925	I have, though, I haven't mentioned this yet, but Alan and I have exchanged some holiday presents because we don't have to wait for Christmas.
458945	461226	We're grown adults and we can do whatever we want in our house.
461266	461827	We set the rules.
462487	468070	Christmas is just a day, you know, so we exchanged holiday presents and Alan got me a Steam Deck.
469107	474093	I got you a thing for it Even though I didn't know I was getting you a thing for it Yes, so like yeah, the same day
484466	485667	I get a gift on Steam.
485707	492930	DarkSakura got me Hades 2, the early access full version, which is like a perfect game for the Steam Deck, which is great.
492950	496311	But yeah, it's one of the Steam Deck OLEDs that's a terabyte.
496371	497852	So it's, you know, one of the newer ones.
497872	499593	So yeah, I'm thrilled with it.
499733	500113	It's great.
500333	502834	But yeah, Bellatro is like a great kind of game to put on it.
502874	504155	But you know what I've been trying to put on it?
504795	505657	I'm just gonna keep it real.
505697	506739	I'm keeping it 100 with you.
506759	508683	I've been trying to put emulators on that thing.
509384	513712	And they have really, like, tried to make the process very easy.
513792	516077	There's this website called EmuDeck.
516837	517337	Don't you have an iPhone?
517357	518757	Why don't you have more USB-C stuff?
540442	558794	I guess I could I guess I could have used my iPhone as like a transfer a go-between but I was like you know what and I'll just get they're like $15 it's and it's useful I don't have to involve my phone so it's fine it was fine it's just I have not been able to get the emulators to run because I really want to play like DS games and stuff on it um
559474	589072	because I still like I still want to do retro games on stream I know I haven't done a lot lately but you know once the holidays die down and stuff I want to kind of get back into the retro games and try to beat a bunch of stuff in 2025 so I thought maybe like DS and things I don't tend to stream would be fun to do on the Steam Deck and it would just it would be a lot of games like I want to get Tetris DS I own that game but I could I just saw today I forgot that it was even on PC but I saw that Luminous is on PC and on Steam so
589574	594636	I forgot about that too I got Loki a game What'd you get Loki?
595316	610522	It was I can't remember the name now It just looks crazy wild It's a mullet magic It's like a roguelike FPS thing, it's pretty hard Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah That's funny
611041	614044	I will also point out, Alan also got me this hat I'm wearing on stream.
614164	617627	For those on the podcast feed, it's an orange Care Bear hat, and it's very fuzzy.
617847	618387	Fuzzy wuzzy.
619108	619989	Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.
621930	622291	Let's see.
622831	624853	What else do I want to say about the Steam thing?
624973	627735	Oh, I need to figure out what I want to get DarkSakura.
628135	635261	I need to figure out if I want to get DarkSakura something on her wish list, or if I want to just buy a game I think she'd like.
635942	640025	because, you know, not to take too much credit, but I helped with the DBD thing.
640425	642046	I helped with the DBD thing.
645029	646450	It's shake and bake and I helped.
648471	650112	It's survive and kill and I helped.
652514	654115	I'm confused.
654375	658018	Because I helped enable your DBD stuff.
658978	662761	And so I'm curious, do I get you a game I think you'd like that you just don't know yet?
663161	663662	Take a risk.
664295	665556	Game Awards Game Awards Game Awards
693905	695347	What did we think of the Game Awards?
695907	700553	I was on a plane, so I missed most of the Game Awards, but Loki, did you watch the Game Awards?
700613	701393	What were your thoughts?
701854	702575	I did.
702855	703596	I thought they were good.
703756	705498	I was hoping for a Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer.
706139	707621	Once again, Rockstar disappoints me.
708201	712186	Typical in the last 10 years, so you know.
713592	714012	It's fine.
714552	715012	It's fine.
715172	718613	There's a lot of like old franchises coming back.
718933	722554	So, you know, we had new trailers for a new Ninja Gaiden game.
722654	723834	Turok's coming back.
723854	725895	That's a retro one, right?
726315	727555	Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
728696	732056	There was, what was the other ones that were like surprising?
732136	733577	Okami coming back.
734197	734517	Yeah.
734577	734837	New game.
735416	742440	A new game from the creator of Shadow of the Colossus and all that stuff.
743320	749163	A lot of surprise things that we weren't really expecting, but I don't know, it was alright.
749764	750284	It was okay.
750304	751885	I don't disagree with some of the winner list.
754441	758066	I thought the best part, at least the part, you know, because I had to kind of see the highlights real and the best stuff.
758467	763474	But I thought the best part that I came across was the guy from, it was Larian Studios, I think, that got up there.
763494	765457	I think it was before he was introducing Game of the Year.
765498	766219	Correct me if I'm wrong.
766619	767921	And he gave this whole speech about...
768502	790371	Game Studios needing the space to make a good game and basically he was reading the house down boots yes god of all these companies that have been laying people off and setting these unreasonable expectations like it was literally saying it to their motherfucking face and I respect that game I know yeah everybody in the audience yay that was the best part of the whole fucking three and a half hour show
791091	792092	That's the ironic part, though.
792132	796114	The CEOs, they showed the CEOs laughing.
796154	798635	It's like, you're just going to lay people off, though.
800016	801057	It's just ironic.
801077	802838	It's like, you know we're talking about you, right?
803118	803838	Yeah.
804118	805579	This is about you.
805599	806700	This is not another company.
806720	807100	This is you.
807120	809861	So the camera actually showed the CEOs.
809901	811322	Was Yves Guillemot in the audience?
812063	813103	I don't remember who was in the audience.
813123	814184	Did they put his ass on camera?
814204	819867	I think it was showing some of the CEOs in the audience and stuff.
819927	820147	Interesting.
820487	846973	like I know we're like Randy Pitchford and stuff like that but I mean that's he's more of a developer like yeah and I don't those are not the folks I'm thinking of when I'm thinking about the people that are ruining the industry and we have an Ubisoft story coming up just you wait because it's a doozy I'm sure some of you have heard but you know there's there's I just feel like yeah there's there's other CEOs that are far more problematic in the industry I guess on my list than
847873	869345	you know the guy from Gearbox who I understand is they've had their own issues over the years but again in the large scope of things Yves Guillemin is still public enemy number one like yeah that was speaking of Gearbox yeah like we they showed off the trailer for Borderlands 4 and I'm like I'm as unhyped as possible about this game like I this does not look
870294	873177	I don't know what you're trying to do here.
873717	877300	The new heroes look as generic as hell.
877400	880283	It's like, oh, is this from Overwatch?
880923	882425	Are these Overwatch characters?
882505	886048	Because it's just so generic.
886068	888090	Imagine if the movie had done well.
889773	890654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
906309	909710	And I chose, and Loki, I think I made the right choice.
909930	918213	I chose to watch the map that shows where your plane is over the country as it slowly moves from destination to destination.
918513	922294	And I feel like I had a better experience than watching the Borderlands movie.
922314	922695	True or true?
922715	923095	You did.
923415	923675	Okay.
923915	924275	True.
924635	925556	It's absolutely true.
925676	929817	It is, it is just, it's unremarkable in every possible way.
932775	934616	It's honestly just a waste of time.
934796	939237	I also watched CNN without audio and I just made up what they were saying.
939357	940338	I'm going to tell you this much.
940838	949841	If you have the inkling to watch the Borderlands movie, do yourself a favor and instead go on YouTube and watch Hundreds of Beavers.
950161	952582	It is free and it is way better of a movie.
957459	959080	YouTube, not Pornhub, right?
959120	960781	YouTube, right?
961021	961862	No, it's YouTube.
961922	962742	It's hilarious.
962903	968446	It is, if you imagine, like, a Looney Tunes cartoon come to life.
968506	969427	It's black and white.
969727	973149	All of the beavers and animals in this are all mascots.
973229	974870	Like, they're all dressed up like mascots.
975811	981314	And it's just the most ridiculous thing made by a dude.
981454	982675	And it happens to be, like...
983908	984688	An actual movie.
985048	985428	It's great.
985528	986229	It really is.
986269	988089	Like, unironically, it's a great movie.
988129	988889	You should go watch it.
988969	991590	It's stupid, but it's just funny.
993770	997091	What on earth brought this hundreds of beavers thing to your attention?
997111	997511	I don't know.
997531	1003053	I kept seeing articles about it and stuff, but it's, yeah, it's ridiculous.
1005723	1033876	it honestly is like a really good movie wait wait is this is this the Mr. Beast show on Amazon is that what I'm watching right is this the Mr. Beast show no but because I think this is yeah they're doing like a log challenge right this is the Mr. Beast show right no it's not it's not the Mr. Beast show but it's it's it's really a funny movie it's just it's very slapstick and it feels a lot like the um
1035521	1036505	Old, like, kind of...
1037890	1039830	Oh wait, I just realized it's not just a clever name.
1039870	1041771	We really do have hundreds of beavers.
1042431	1045991	I don't know how many of them were AI generated, but we did have legitimately hundreds of beavers.
1046171	1047432	None were AI generated.
1048612	1051132	It's just a lot of composings.
1051512	1055193	It's just kind of along the lines of Kung Fury.
1055833	1063114	Something like that where it's basically one dude in the green screen and just kind of a small team and making all that stuff up.
1063875	1065595	Is this worth me spending $20 on though?
1067136	1068157	It's free with ads on YouTube.
1068177	1068577	It's free.
1068717	1069357	Yeah, it's free.
1070118	1070418	Free?
1071018	1071899	Yeah, it's free.
1071919	1072399	Free 99?
1072439	1072739	On where?
1073380	1073720	YouTube.
1073780	1076462	Just Google or YouTube search hundreds of beavers.
1076542	1078163	It's like the first or second result.
1079083	1082566	Oh, because I found the... I was looking on my Apple TV.
1083386	1083786	Oh, oh.
1084347	1085587	No, don't pay for the beavers.
1086468	1087288	Get them for free.
1088689	1090811	Why pay for the beavers when you can get it for free?
1092392	1093672	Get those ad-supported beavers.
1094033	1095954	I'm looking at the trailer and this is great.
1097244	1101506	It is honestly... It feels... The movie feels... I'm going to tell you this much.
1101566	1103247	The movie does feel very long.
1103867	1105247	It is like a cartoon.
1105467	1109169	It feels like a very long movie, but it is so worth it to stay to the end.
1109489	1111910	It honestly is completely...
1113066	1113526	It's worth it.
1113666	1117227	It just gets more and more ridiculous as time goes on.
1117287	1119828	Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1120128	1120448	Let's see.
1120768	1122789	PodCulture says, what in the high hell?
1122889	1123449	Yeah, pretty much.
1123949	1125610	I kind of want to give this guy money.
1127430	1128150	It's a great movie.
1128310	1129511	I heard things about this movie.
1129571	1130291	It sounds wild.
1130371	1132932	Red Entertainment says, is this a Canadian action movie?
1134072	1147743	I believe it is Canadian SSJ100Matt says the people look better treated in this than with that Mr. Beast show true I hear the Mr. Beast show isn't very good either no, it's
1149184	1157009	Yeah, but for the record, I follow a tech reviewer called Mr. Who's the Boss.
1158330	1162712	And he was pulled in to do the behind the scenes on all the tech that goes into it.
1163773	1167535	And that was just the setup, though, to do everything.
1167555	1168976	It was fucking impressive.
1169777	1177261	I had to say that I'm more interested in the technology that they used to get it than in the actual show.
1179127	1182952	But I also want to sit on a throne of a million dollars.
1183714	1184575	Or however much money that was.
1185872	1187893	Here's my take on the Mr. Beast show thing.
1188353	1192415	They literally already did that show and it was the Squid Game reality show.
1192835	1194695	And the Squid Game reality show didn't have a host.
1195856	1197876	And, you know, it had all the drama and all that stuff.
1197937	1199497	And here's the thing with Mr. Beast.
1199537	1204779	At some point, and look, I've seen some of his older YouTubes and I get the whole shtick and all that stuff.
1204799	1210561	But there comes a point with any showman we have to ask, at what point did this individual fall up their own ass?
1211141	1233636	and that's the question that I'm kind of asking about Mr. Beast right now at what point did that whole what point did he fall up his own ass because watching a show like that you're just like this is this is him up there smelling his own farts that's that's what this is um and I think we just as a society have to say you know what his is he peaked he peaked
1235319	1237181	And his candy isn't that good.
1237321	1242806	There's a lot of these showman people that always... I would say Elon Musk is another great example of a showman.
1242846	1248552	A showy-ass fucking showman who definitely fell up his own ass and a lot of other people's asses.
1248632	1252275	I mean, but now he's the president, so I mean, that's a thing.
1252836	1254337	Don't get me fucking started.
1254818	1256019	Don't get me... You know what?
1257460	1258921	I just... All I'm getting... I'm...
1260160	1262502	I'm glad people can see what they voted for.
1262843	1267967	I hope everybody can take, you know, at least 49% of this country can just take comfort.
1268028	1269269	That's what you voted for.
1269429	1269869	Enjoy.
1270570	1270930	Enjoy.
1271150	1272211	This is yours.
1272972	1273272	You own it.
1273293	1276335	Meanwhile, I'm going to be stocking up on chocolate because of the import tariffs.
1276656	1278017	Well, just don't get the Mr. Beast chocolate.
1278057	1278598	It's shitty.
1278958	1279238	All right.
1280019	1281640	I just said I didn't care for it.
1282958	1285640	I want good chocolate, but the good chocolate comes from Ghana.
1286860	1287160	All right.
1287701	1291723	Let's get into some other stuff at the top of the show here.
1291763	1293784	We actually did have a topic we wanted to get into.
1294164	1296346	And look, it's the holiday period.
1296746	1297666	Things are getting slower.
1297727	1304891	We actually, if I'm not mistaken, we actually have, this doesn't happen often, but we actually have Christmas and Hanukkah on the same day, right?
1305271	1307272	So everything's, or at least the start of Hanukkah.
1307572	1312653	Hanukkah starts sundown on the 25th, so yes, because Jewish holidays are sundown to sundown.
1312793	1313113	Right, right.
1313173	1314754	It's a day.
1314814	1317214	And then Kwanzaa always starts on December 26th.
1317434	1319075	I guess Yule was yesterday.
1319435	1321675	So I feel like everything is kind of landing in the same week.
1323216	1330938	Hanukkah is usually during the middle of Christmas for the most part, but this one is just like, I get extended holiday.
1331278	1331558	Early.
1331618	1332578	It was early.
1332678	1334438	Last year or the year before, it was like super early.
1334458	1336539	Well, keep in mind, you're dealing with a lunar calendar.
1336559	1337019	I know, I know.
1337259	1337839	Enjoy your vote.
1338199	1339200	I love that.
1339400	1340020	Enjoy your vote.
1362051	1362291	All right.
1362932	1364395	Anyway, okay.
1364595	1370443	So not as much news, but boy, are there rumors because, you know, everybody's looking forward to 2025.
1371304	1372827	What's going to happen in 2025?
1373468	1375170	And Loki, it's the Switch 2, right?
1375190	1375531	2025, finally?
1375551	1375671	Yeah.
1375691	1375771	Yeah.
1377353	1383037	Well, there's a little bit, so there's not necessarily, some of these are a little bit more substantiated than others.
1383397	1399767	So, for example, we kind of know what the Switch 2 is going to look like because there's been essentially product models that have gone out to like accessory companies to allow them to build accessories for these devices.
1400427	1410754	and so one of them actually I don't know why this company publicly gave this to a YouTuber but whatever it's essentially a 3D printed copy of
1411735	1413316	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1435493	1435733	and so on.
1454013	1473816	along with that though there's like kind of a breakdown of some of the different features from a bunch of different rumor mills and stuff like that so you know obviously they're saying that the Switch 2 is going to be called the Switch 2 it's basically the same as the Nintendo Switch but it has a number 2 on it they said that they're
1474737	1478102	is, yeah, the long, rounded hollow area.
1478162	1478483	Why not?
1478503	1479384	Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.
1479504	1483249	Pixel 9, iPhone 16, like, why not?
1483429	1484451	You can number the device.
1484731	1488076	I think Nintendo Switch 2 would honestly be a fine name.
1489383	1497265	Yeah, and then it says, yeah, basically the Joy-Cons are going to use magnetic hall effect thumbsticks.
1497365	1501006	So that makes it so that they're not going to be drifting, which is nice.
1502667	1506908	There's a U-shaped rail of a kickstand.
1507108	1512769	It looks like the kickstand actually from the model that looked like it was like the same one that was on the OLED.
1512850	1514170	So it might be something like that.
1514970	1543483	they said the Switch dock is slightly different also the Switch itself the Switch 2 has a USB port on top and on bottom the thought is maybe that they're going to use that in case you want to charge it so it won't be in the way if it's like on the bottom like a lot of times so you have an option to plug it in the top or bottom maybe like their accessories can plug into it as well you can also have something plugged in while it's docked is what that says to me
1544330	1554418	Uh, possibly, yeah, I mean, but even though now, though, the dock does normally have, like, USB ports on it, so maybe it's that, or it could be that, you know, you're...
1555632	1559575	Maybe they support USB headphones, something like that.
1559695	1567822	But there's still... The setup is pretty much the same as the Switch itself, the only difference being that USB port on top.
1569663	1577990	Yeah, and then just the new dock, or the dock for the Switch 2 is rated for 45 watts instead of 60 watts, whatever the hell that means.
1578010	1578490	Yeah.
1578830	1598007	and the yeah the cooling vents are a little bit different so essentially you're getting a switch it's probably going to be more powerful it's going to be bigger and it's going to have magnetic joy cons so it's not a pain in the ass to put them on and off and also you can't put them on backwards where they get jammed in there and stuck and the joysticks won't suck so
1599423	1602024	I'm excited to see what games are coming.
1602064	1611550	To be fair, I'm fine with it being the formula that works and just being more souped up, I guess, with the parts being more.
1611670	1615972	That being said, I think it took way too fucking long to get here, if that is what it is.
1617653	1621735	But it just makes me feel more and more like the OLED switch was really supposed to be something different.
1623476	1628659	But pandemic and all that, with supply issues and all that other stuff, it just didn't pan out that way.
1629539	1634901	Speaking of super things, looking in chat, PogCulture says, should have been Super Switch for the name.
1635641	1644083	But Mike Deft replies and comments, as much as us retro nerds would love that, I think keeping it simple and just numbering the thing is better for sales.
1644463	1645804	And I'm kind of with Deft.
1645844	1647964	And like, you know, yeah, PogCulture, the name is cute.
1648124	1649284	I've said it too at some point.
1649365	1652145	But I also kind of realized, like, you know, I just gave those examples.
1652165	1654526	That's kind of what people are sort of used to with tech.
1655026	1681014	is that the device gets you know a higher number and people go higher number mean better and so it you know that's that's what people are sort of conditioned to at this point and so that's why I'm like yeah Switch 2 is a fine name and honestly we all do not want them to make a mistake like they made with Wii U and give it like a really silly name and if they're not changing up the formula of the whole Switch concept sure Switch 2 great do it it's fine um
1682094	1682474	Let's see.
1683175	1687838	SJ100Matt says, I'm interested to see the games and how they look like Pokemon Legends ZA.
1688378	1690360	Oh, that is 100% true.
1690380	1690740	100% true.
1690920	1691941	I'm really excited.
1691981	1693482	I just want to see what they're launching with.
1693502	1695623	I want to see how it changes the old games too.
1696424	1698785	Yeah, see how that works.
1698825	1702027	I'll play Pokemon Legends all over again if it runs better on Switch too.
1702367	1709092	I can imagine, if I were to guess, I would say that maybe the older versions of the games would run
1710086	1715270	basically in the docked mode, but on the handheld.
1715330	1720673	So essentially, it would improve the performance using it via handheld.
1721694	1722975	Then what is it like if it's docked?
1724236	1725276	It doesn't do anything.
1726737	1727418	It's the reverse.
1727478	1728439	It's worse.
1731201	1731781	No, I don't know.
1732662	1733402	We'll have to see.
1733442	1736604	I mean, I'm sure we're going to get an announcement within a few weeks.
1737145	1737285	Yeah.
1738166	1739587	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1763155	1782275	um it was kind of limited of course because I have a stitch in my finger um it makes it really hard for anything that I need to be able to use my enter key with typing was a pain in the ass let me tell you um so I've basically stuck to things I can play with my controller easily I'm not venturing into dead by daylight on a controller no thank you
1783356	1785518	So I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age, The Veil Guard.
1785818	1788280	I'm super into it.
1789582	1791243	And I played a little bit of Polya.
1791403	1794245	I've played some Dead by Daylight, just not very well.
1797728	1799730	Yeah, mostly that stuff.
1801051	1802352	I think I played a little Klonoa.
1802372	1803613	How cute.
1803753	1805214	Because I fucking love Klonoa.
1806275	1808797	And a couple of shooters.
1808897	1809538	What did I play?
1809578	1810739	I played some Raiden.
1810879	1811619	That's what I played.
1811839	1812200	Nice.
1813407	1816969	So, yeah, just, you know, into just some little things.
1817009	1820432	But I've been mostly just super busy prepping for my ballet recital.
1820452	1823374	Okay, fair enough.
1823674	1824454	Loki, we'll go to you.
1824514	1825155	How was your game week?
1827036	1828257	I did a lot of Minecraft stuff.
1828297	1833060	I've been working really hard on getting the final area of my theme park done.
1864633	1875283	and that's just on Steam I also have it on my phone so you know playing that when we go to piano practice and stuff like that
1876124	1880127	Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1899339	1915354	I thought Ariana Grande was perfect Cynthia Erivo obviously has a set of pipes she's great so yeah it was great but that's not why I thought of you Loki I thought of you because in the 25 minutes of trailers leading up to the movie and commercials we got to see the newest trailer for the Minecraft movie mhm
1916854	1917715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1938925	1941806	I really, really hope for him it's better than this trailer.
1941826	1942126	I mean...
1968390	1971172	I'm sure it'll be, I don't know, it'll be okay.
1971412	1972613	It's gonna be what it is.
1972974	1976136	It's either gonna be really terrible or pretty good.
1976256	1983142	So it's, I think either way it'll be enjoyable to either make fun of it or to enjoy it.
1984248	1987012	TigerClaw in chat says, have you seen the Superman trailer?
1987252	1988053	Actually, yes.
1988153	1992719	And I will say, and I feel like a lot of people are feeling this way, it looked pretty good.
1993119	1997444	Like, it's really easy to be very cynical about a lot of those superhero movie trailers sometimes.
1997865	1999086	That Superman trailer looked...
1999947	2003151	Looked like they found the sweet spot of modernizing the 70s movies.
2003171	2006976	Well, it's James Gunn, so James Gunn does no wrong.
2007376	2009299	Yeah, it's completely recast.
2010360	2010981	It's a new guy.
2011001	2011862	I don't even know his name.
2012122	2013283	Lois Lane's different, too.
2013404	2014365	It's a whole new cast.
2015086	2019171	Except Nathan Fillion is in it as the green...
2020182	2021223	I hate that character.
2042540	2044802	But it feels like they're packing a lot of characters in that.
2044822	2051527	The fucking dog, super dog, Crypto, is in it and is kind of a key part of that trailer.
2051567	2060475	I will say the best part of that Superman trailer was the music because it sort of incorporates the 70s theme but isn't a copy of it.
2061055	2061856	I'll watch the trailer.
2080748	2083229	This is the year we're going to go see more movies than we never do.
2083249	2085310	We really need to stick to it this next year.
2086190	2088311	Because we obviously have to go see the Wicked sequel.
2089232	2091033	That's when it hopefully won't take us so long.
2091093	2092273	I still haven't seen it.
2092413	2093794	I haven't seen the play.
2093994	2094714	I don't care.
2094914	2095795	And I'll tell you why.
2096375	2098536	Because it deviates from the book way too much.
2099468	2104830	The original LF Bomb books, or you mean the musical deviates from the book?
2104870	2107330	Okay, so I'll say this.
2107610	2111732	From the book, and I like the sequel, Son of a Witch.
2112692	2113632	I'll say this much.
2114252	2119734	So, because I did feel when I walked away from the Wicked movie, I was like, okay, that feels kind of padded.
2120214	2123655	And I could tell that it's padded, because they have to make it two movies.
2123955	2126216	But I also don't know how they could make it just one.
2126596	2127637	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2144076	2145237	Oh, the book goes there.
2145397	2148502	I mean, there's a full description of what her cooch looks like.
2148962	2149863	Oh, heck no.
2150604	2151566	No, that's not in the movie.
2151606	2153428	And it's gross because it's written by a guy.
2153989	2156072	But the rest of the book is so good.
2156232	2159056	It's like political intrigue and...
2160838	2176811	Some of that comes through in the movie because I will say I did find myself, especially in the first hour and a half of the movie, I found myself sitting there watching going, I don't know if this movie works as well as it does in a year that's not 2024.
2177612	2185598	I will say that was a strong reaction I had going, you would almost think they were beating us over the head with this if I didn't know that this was based on a book written in the 90s.
2186539	2188804	I kind of wish that there was a movie for Tale of an Ugly Stepsister.
2196701	2197422	No, I don't know that one.
2197682	2198903	It's so good.
2199203	2201625	I do want to find out more about that Son of a Witch, though.
2201645	2205608	I know that, yeah, it's all about, I know generally what it's about.
2205728	2207149	Yeah.
2207229	2214275	They have said they're looking into doing, like, continuing the Wicked universe further after these movies, but they don't just want to do, like, Wicked 3 and 4.
2214355	2215055	That wouldn't make sense.
2215476	2218178	I wonder if that's not the route they go down, that they end up adapting that.
2218198	2220299	Especially, I could spoil how it ends, but.
2220840	2221861	Well, don't, but yeah.
2221881	2222701	Well, we know how it ends.
2222821	2224323	I know how Wicked ends.
2224503	2225163	I know how Wicked ends.
2225443	2225944	Oh, yeah.
2227844	2228064	All right.
2228104	2230045	Anyway, enough about Wicked.
2230085	2232307	Sorry, it's supposed to be gaming weeks, but, you know, holiday week.
2232507	2232947	Lack of news.
2233267	2234008	So my gaming week.
2234028	2234728	So Steam Deck.
2234808	2236510	Yes, I've been playing some things on my Steam Deck.
2236550	2238271	I talked about before Hades and Hades 2.
2239452	2241733	And yeah, some things here and there.
2242394	2243715	A little bit of No Man's Sky.
2244035	2246176	That was the first game I had to play on the deck was No Man's Sky.
2246276	2247677	And it runs pretty well.
2247717	2249539	It was still installing games in the background.
2249579	2251200	So I think it was cutting into performance.
2251640	2278870	but um you know it works about as well as you would think it's probably better than a Switch uh as how it runs so um yeah I was a fan of that um the biggest thing I've also been playing this week here we go so we have all these holiday sales that have been going on and I kept telling myself I said I am not buying that World of Warcraft expansion until it goes on sale and during Black Friday it did not go on sale and I said I'm not buying it it's not on sale well
2280234	2280995	How much did you pay for it?
2281015	2282535	That's what they put on sale for the holidays.
2282856	2283236	25% off.
2283256	2285977	So I want to say it was like $32 or something like that.
2285997	2288139	Beats a sharp stick in the eye.
2288359	2289539	Yeah, I bought War Within.
2290220	2291460	But I will say this.
2291841	2296403	It's weird because modern WoW is so different than classic WoW.
2296423	2303207	They've just changed so much, especially when it comes to quality of life improvements of the systems and all that stuff and how you quest and all these other things.
2303567	2308170	But I will say there are some mechanics in WoW, modern WoW, like they really...
2308610	2309270	It's interesting.
2309330	2315313	You really see how Final Fantasy XIV's success has strongly influenced WoW.
2315733	2318654	And in this thing, it's really about NPCs.
2319054	2323216	They took a lot of what trusts have become in Final Fantasy XIV and they put it in.
2323236	2325837	But I would say they actually took it one step further and made it better.
2326217	2331139	Because they have not just that you can take NPCs into full-on regular dungeons.
2331439	2333160	You can just take NPCs into dungeons now.
2333500	2335561	But they also have these specific things called Delves.
2336181	2343366	that are kind of like the scenarios in Pandaria, but they feel a lot more like they're actual mini dungeons.
2343746	2348709	And they have a whole sliding difficulty, and you do it with NPCs, and I think it's great.
2348769	2351031	And I kind of hope Final Fantasy XIV incorporates some of that.
2351631	2353733	Obviously, Final Fantasy XIV owes its...
2354233	2355073	I'm not going to say that.
2378483	2384306	Yeah, my heart is with Final Fantasy because I've always been a Final Fantasy fanboy, but there is room in my heart for both.
2384506	2390128	I like both games, and I recognize that when both games are doing well, MMOs as a whole and gaming in general is better.
2390469	2393150	And so I'm glad that they're both in the place that they're at.
2393210	2405856	I'm not glad Blizzard had to struggle to get there, but I'm very glad to see that Blizzard is, appearingly, on the other end of these struggles, and WoW is a better product as a result than it was during
2406656	2407237	DarkSakura DarkSakura
2419329	2420630	I remember enjoying Legion.
2421491	2424834	Yeah, well, Legion was probably the last really good expansion.
2425154	2430498	But to be fair, actually, Dragonflight, the last one, I played through the main scenario in that and I remember enjoying it.
2430578	2431960	I just kind of fell off at some point.
2432660	2440807	I was kind of thinking about getting in and trying to do the Dragonflight stuff, but the Shadowland thing doesn't really piss me off so much because they...
2443203	2443944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2466846	2489123	you can run instances with everything and I don't even know if guilds can be crossed but like they are definitely tearing down a lot of walls between Horde and Alliance I mean you can still go to a PvP server and it's like old school if that's what you want but otherwise yeah I think it's a little bit more kind of real world nuanced if you think about it yeah because I mean one wasn't bad
2490420	2492262	They just had different philosophies.
2492362	2493302	It's a different culture.
2493503	2504891	Well, again, I don't want to keep saying that WoW owes everything to Final Fantasy XIV, but I think the success of XIV kind of showed, and a big key element of XIV is that everybody's on the same side.
2505311	2510054	I mean, yeah, you can pick one of three city states for PvP, but it really doesn't matter.
2510495	2511635	It really doesn't matter.
2511916	2514617	And like everybody plays together in 14 and it's fine.
2515078	2521142	And so I kind of think that nudged WoW to move in this direction where it's like, you know what, more people to party up with is better than less.
2521909	2545829	can people actually understand each other now though that's the thing uh I don't know like in party chat yeah but in the open language yeah I know I know what you're talking about but I don't know I haven't tried it I haven't tried it um I did want to address some comments in chat because I haven't um see everything uh pod culture says there is a prequel book coming on young Elphaba I didn't know that that's it but I guess I'm not surprised to hear that is actually written by the guy McGuire
2547139	2552806	He's still around, I would assume so, but we'll see.
2553587	2556271	Bonds006 says, no spoilers, but saw Sonic 3.
2556972	2561318	Yeah, I have to catch up on the Sonic movies, but I definitely noticed that Sonic was playing down the hall.
2561658	2589052	and all the families were going to see Sonic so like it must have done good box office this weekend because that Sonic showing looks sold out by the way because I didn't do my research in advance I had tickets to see Wicked downtown at what we call the Golden 1 Center because the Golden 1 Arena is there where the Sacramento Kings play and smart ass fucking me bought tickets when the exact same time as the Kings vs. Lakers game at that Golden 1 Arena fuck
2592065	2597710	I mean, I survived, but I got really annoyed at the parking attendance there, but we'll save that for later.
2597730	2598631	We saw Wicked.
2598691	2615044	I don't even know what it is because I've never really seen a theater like this, but they had this weird thing where the movie's projected on the screen in front of you, and they project it on the walls too, so it's like a weird wraparound thing.
2615064	2616826	That sounds horrible.
2616886	2618327	It was kind of cool, actually.
2618747	2619368	I'd be into that.
2619968	2620449	Interesting.
2621055	2642510	yeah so that was kind of overwhelming it was at first but then you kind of get used to it and it was all right but yeah i saw sonic 3 my autistic brain tiger claw says it beat mufasa did it really it did yeah wow there was a mufasa movie yeah i think and i think that says all you need to know
2645299	2647603	I don't keep up with movies that much anymore.
2648564	2649005	I don't either.
2649185	2651449	What was the last movie I saw?
2651549	2654274	Alien Romulus was the last movie I think I saw.
2654294	2654334	So
2657150	2659531	I was going to say, I watched the Sonic 3 movie.
2659551	2660191	It was good.
2660391	2662492	I liked it because, you know, Jim Carrey, of course.
2663212	2667334	And then I also watched Secret Level, that series.
2668735	2672096	Oh, I think we had a Blue Sky post about that.
2672116	2674597	So I'm going to come back to you later on that question, okay, about Secret Level.
2674637	2674757	Okay.
2675037	2677578	Okay, also I wanted to get some other comments here.
2677839	2685423	TigerClaw is pointing out, now TigerClaw is a Sonic fanboy, but has receipts in chat showing that Sonic 3 is certified fresh with 86%.
2685883	2690946	It's the highest rated video game movie of all time as far as Metacritic goes.
2691246	2696148	You know, it depends what kind of stock you want to put in Metacritic, but still, he has a point.
2696208	2699310	You don't see video game movies very often getting such high ratings from critics.
2699510	2700351	That's pretty impressive.
2700851	2701011	So...
2703487	2704348	That's pretty interesting.
2704888	2705149	All right.
2705349	2705689	Oh, sorry.
2705769	2706710	Rotten Tomatoes, not Medicare.
2706730	2708011	Well, same thing.
2708391	2709011	Same thing.
2709031	2709592	They own them.
2709752	2710492	It's the same thing.
2710552	2713314	And SSJ100Matt is asking, did you see it at Arco Arena?
2713414	2713674	Yes.
2713814	2714135	I'm sorry.
2714175	2714495	I forgot.
2714515	2714675	Yes.
2714735	2715616	Everything is Arco Arena.
2715676	2715876	Yes.
2716376	2717317	I saw it at Arco Arena.
2719264	2719904	But guess what?
2720585	2723847	The beam did not turn on because the kings lost.
2724107	2725067	So there was no beam.
2725127	2726288	And no one is surprised.
2726308	2728769	So we're back to the old kings.
2728909	2729210	All right.
2729310	2732071	Anyway, what else was my gaming week?
2732271	2733332	I think I've said enough.
2734605	2736647	World of Warcraft, that was the big one.
2737027	2738569	I'm leveling fast.
2738689	2742713	I'm already like level 76 and I haven't left the first zone.
2742753	2743554	It's kind of surprising.
2744134	2744715	You know what, Rob?
2745355	2748719	What if I went back to WoW and revived Rebecca Black?
2748739	2749319	You should.
2749379	2749640	You should.
2749660	2752062	By the way, Rebecca's- My level 80 paladin.
2752202	2753804	Okay, but like if you haven't heard-
2755245	2760771	If you haven't heard Rebecca Black's new music, like keep in mind she's in her late 20s now.
2760972	2761953	They're fucking bangers.
2762153	2763114	Like she's a pop.
2763174	2764516	Oh no, I'm totally into her.
2764696	2765737	Yeah, she's, oh, she's.
2766758	2768120	And she goes off.
2768340	2770062	And here's the thing about Rebecca Black.
2772360	2792132	and if you this is always going to be the barometer I don't care who you are what you're into it this is always going to be the barometer the gays are eating Rebecca Black up right now she did a thing in San Francisco that was like a free concert where she was like DJing or something and like there's shots of City Hall or wherever the whole thing was going on wall-to-wall people
2792632	2821975	everybody turned out for Rebecca Black and honestly if I wasn't in Nashville that same weekend I probably would have gone so like like like I know Rebecca Black was like a he he ha ha when when Friday came out but I'm telling you sort of go listen to um uh oh god I can't remember the name of that single that just came out so throw this out here and this is not a me I I see the future it's when she did Saturday
2824485	2824605	Trust.
2824625	2824725	Trust.
2824745	2824865	Yeah.
2824925	2825286	Good for her.
2825346	2826847	We love a redemption arc.
2826867	2828048	I mean, not that she ever... Like, again...
2849008	2849688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2874508	2886793	Alright, well, we had a call, I guess, or investor call, I'm assuming, with Microsoft talking about, you know, where they see the future of Xbox.
2887253	2893236	And one of the quotes that came out of that is basically that we're redefining what it means to be an Xbox fan.
2893376	2895356	And to which I say, no, the fuck you aren't.
2895857	2898678	You stupid buzz speak that you say.
2899318	2902339	What they're trying to push is that, hey, you know what?
2902439	2905861	Being an Xbox fan doesn't mean that you own an Xbox necessarily.
2906081	2910043	It means that you play Xbox games, but those games may be on...
2911317	2912197	Other platforms.
2912477	2914658	They may be on mobile devices.
2914978	2916638	They may be on your computer.
2916718	2921140	They may be on, you know, a TV with a built-in Xbox app.
2921300	2922320	You know, cloud streaming.
2922540	2930962	It's just wherever Xbox platform is available, that's where they're basically saying you can play it anywhere you want.
2931963	2934663	And you can see this with their new advertising campaign.
2934683	2935664	This is an Xbox!
2935744	2937304	Yeah, exactly.
2937664	2938584	Oh, this is an Xbox.
2938604	2939905	It's becoming more of a brand.
2940825	2969579	you know listen you know at the end of the day what the message should be is that no corporation is going to tell you what the fuck you are okay so just tell them to shut the fuck up and keep making your games and then that'd be it I mean because oh we're redefining what a fan is no the fuck you are just like you're redefining what TV is like shut up like seriously shut the fuck up like you don't know what the hell you're talking about so yeah Xbox corporate speak you know what's
2970419	2972019	You know what's interesting in Xbox Land?
2972240	2994966	Here's the interesting thing about Xbox Land, because we've been off for a couple weeks, and I think something we've kind of missed is that the launch of the Indiana Jones game from Bethesda, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, apparently people are saying... It's getting big kudos, and there's a lot of people saying, Xbox has a banger of an exclusive in this, and apparently Indiana Jones is...
2995806	2996527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3013926	3016387	So I'm like, I'd play it.
3016868	3021510	But just to show like, well, Xbox is having a pretty good year.
3021730	3026713	And obviously, Hellblade 2 got a lot of nominations.
3026793	3029214	And they seem to have some really good exclusives right now.
3029694	3034237	And I feel like more people are talking about that than, well, what did Sony put out this half of the year?
3034697	3037639	Sony's kind of been like, I don't think they really had any bigger exclusives.
3037659	3040040	Well, they remastered The Last of Us again.
3040360	3045344	They didn't really have any... So I feel like Microsoft's made the most of this opportunity for whatever it's worth.
3045984	3047065	I mean, they had Astrobots.
3047465	3048886	Oh, yeah, Astrobots.
3048926	3050087	That did well.
3051748	3052169	Game of the Year
3078191	3105792	also we shouldn't be fans of consoles we should be fans of games like honestly like stop like they a lot of corporations and I'm just very anti-corporation now lots of corporations want you to root for them and like be on their back and defend them from criticism and stuff like that I don't think we should be doing any of that I think if you're a fan of a game you're a fan of a game but don't like the console war thing is over the console war thing is all made up
3107110	3107930	what does that always say?
3108130	3134495	a system is only as good as the games that are on it yeah it's just nobody should be exactly, you're going to have ups, you're going to have downs you know, at the end of the day it's the developers who should matter it's not these publishers and these console manufacturers that should make matter at all, it really isn't and I don't know, I just I'm kind of tired of it
3135014	3135634	No, I hear you.
3136135	3152905	Yeah, I think though that it's an overall sentiment with all of the drama that we've had with all these companies and their leadership, you know, amongst other things that were, there just seems to be a lot of consumer fatigue around that whole concept as well.
3153066	3153566	You know what I mean?
3155347	3158709	Honestly, I think there's a lot of consumer fatigue in general.
3162371	3164693	But I have many, many thoughts on that.
3167405	3170531	I still am trying to wrap words around, if that makes sense.
3170891	3171092	Sure.
3172334	3172595	All right.
3172775	3174618	Well, for now, I'm going to... Look, I feel you on that.
3174638	3175340	I absolutely do.
3176650	3184092	For now, I'm going to trek on over to our next story, which is about the end of Dungeons & Dragons, or at least one version of it.
3184152	3190633	So it's Dungeons & Dragons Dark Alliance is going to be shut down by Wizards of the Coast early in 2025.
3190733	3196974	The game will no longer be available for purchase and all the servers will be going down permanently on February 24th, 2025.
3198755	3204956	Saving the base game and all DLC is still available to play an offline single player by anybody who currently owns it.
3205677	3222240	Dark Alliance of course originally launched in 2021 with a single player mode and you can do up to four players co-op online and that was the first time that Wizards of the Coast did a D&D dedicated game and that was supposed to be kind of a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance.
3223181	3229987	But it did not get quite the same high scores review-wise as the predecessors to that.
3230528	3235733	And imagine most of the D&D fans are being satisfied right now by Baldur's Gate 3.
3236733	3243019	So there's probably a reason why in there they're saying goodbye to this old game.
3243920	3245522	So that is going to be ending.
3245582	3247163	There's always been these rumors...
3247984	3248725	Well, um...
3274272	3283341	I think, you know, considering like old IPs and things like that too, um, Capcom is still going on their thing to reactivate their old IPs, you know.
3284402	3297875	Um, they are, uh, they had a shareholder meeting in June where they were saying they were reviewing what's next and that fans were saying they wanted to see stuff like Breath of Fire and, uh,
3298755	3309119	you know, Crazy Taxi and Shinobi and Jet Set Radio, Virtua Fighter so they are still going back through everything where is our Project Justice or our rival schools?
3309319	3313240	I'm looking at you, Capcom I'll take a Mega Man Legends, thank you
3315285	3333928	The company is working to further enhance corporate value by leveraging its rich library of content, which includes reviving its past IPs, like the two titles announced above, Onimusha and Okami, in order to continuously produce highly efficient, high-quality titles.
3334709	3336709	So yeah, we are getting another Okami game.
3336889	3337629	Ah, so pretty.
3338409	3341370	So, maybe it can happen.
3341990	3342810	We keep pushing on them.
3345608	3366649	DarkTipsy in chat says you know where they could start Mega Man hasn't had a new game since Mega Man 11 but I suppose what they're doing with Okami and Onimusha so there's that I think those are testing the waters that's where I see that alright let's move on Loki let's look at something that shouldn't have passed the testing stage Loki
3368946	3373171	And there's just no getting through to Ubisoft, honestly.
3373431	3379818	I mean, they've dabbled in NFTs in the past with this failed... I don't even remember what it was.
3380279	3384123	Failed system with the Rainbow Six franchise and stuff like that, but...
3384944	3387405	Now they're doubling down, because you know what?
3387726	3391388	They're not going to be told that, no, this isn't going to be successful.
3391988	3398312	So now, Captain Laserhawk, the game, Captain Laserhawk being a character from the Blood Dragon spin-off.
3398332	3404315	This just sounds like someone went to chat GPT and said, name my video game superhero for my NFT game.
3404735	3407177	Well, first off, I forgot this was even a thing.
3407237	3412760	So yeah, they had a Captain Laserhawk animated series that was on Netflix, completely...
3413320	3415201	Slip my mind that that was a thing.
3416641	3422043	And then, of course, now this brand new game also has Rayman in it as well.
3422444	3428326	But even to start playing the game, you need a Ninja Warrior NFT to play.
3429306	3445153	and they were offering 10,000 of them for free with some Web3 transactions or something like that, but it ends up that you have to fork over about $14 or .0022 in Ethereum.
3445793	3446133	No thanks.
3447234	3454797	And essentially they also added Rayman as an announcer for these deathmatches in this game, which is weird.
3455817	3456958	And yeah, so...
3458158	3462482	In the end, you know, to summarize, this is bullshit.
3462642	3463243	Don't buy it.
3463303	3463924	Don't play it.
3464484	3470350	And yeah, just let it rot like all the other NFT stuff that Ubisoft wants to put out.
3470610	3472391	It is not going to happen, Ubisoft.
3472491	3472952	Sorry.
3473332	3474894	That ship has sailed.
3475534	3482321	I mean, it's like if you were to have built the Titanic right next to a iceberg and you just...
3483859	3501090	you cracked the champagne on the board and it crashed immediately of Costa Rica so it's just not gonna happen and just don't when I see NFT my mind immediately goes no fucking thanks exactly
3503140	3503481	All right.
3504282	3509168	Well, let's move on to a better use of your money, and that is spending it on sales.
3509609	3516218	Increasing your backlog of games you will never, ever play thanks to things like the Steam Winter Sale.
3516238	3517699	And that's right, the Steam Winter Sale...
3518160	3531051	Did kick off a couple days ago and it is running through January 2nd And you can get such titles like Baldur's Gate 3 for $48 Cyberpunk 2077 for $27 Elden Ring for $36, that's 40% off A 60% discount on No Man's Sky for $24 Cities Skyline down to $9 Let's see, Bellatro is on sale as well I don't see the price on that, but...
3544403	3555517	yeah it's it's down as well so there's a lot of sales and of course you get a lot of games dirt cheap too for example if you want to play Larian Studios game before Baldur's Gate 3 Divinity Original Sin you can pick that up for four bucks
3556283	3557344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3579313	3605569	the day we're doing this podcast which is a few years old at this point but it's a decent it's a fun little game if you didn't know that the first game they gave away on Thursday was Vampire Survivors so if you somehow still didn't have that game hopefully you picked up on that on Thursday but if not it's it's on Xbox Game Pass it's like five dollars on most of the storefronts probably even on sale on a lot of them right now it's it's very much worth your time to check that game out
3606129	3628949	so but usually keep an eye out because Epic Games Store usually puts out a pretty big one right at the end they might do a big one on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day because I think they gave away the Tomb Raider trilogy at one point like the new Tomb Raider games like was either last year or the year before so keep an eye out because they usually do a pretty big banger either the last day or like on one of the big holidays so
3631138	3632779	if you are an Epic person.
3632819	3634640	Some people are like, I'm not installing that shit.
3634680	3635240	That's fine.
3635660	3636720	But, you know.
3637381	3641302	For anyone on Epic, Marvel's Midnight Suns is nine bucks right now.
3641323	3641723	Oh, nice.
3642703	3645324	And it's a fun game and is absolutely worth having.
3645484	3646785	Yeah.
3647025	3652828	And as Joe and Hunter Matt is pointing out in chat, the first game you should get on Steam or itch.io is Pixel Poops number two.
3652948	3653168	Yes.
3655969	3660611	Show your loved ones you love them this holiday season by giving them the gift of poop.
3663905	3664906	Fun for the whole family.
3666267	3666587	All right.
3667768	3668309	Let's move on.
3669850	3671331	DarkSakura, I think we're up over to you.
3672332	3672733	Oh, yeah.
3673253	3677857	So Sega is potentially making a bad decision.
3678758	3680079	Sorry, potentially making a bad decision.
3680099	3680740	I'll say it louder.
3681801	3687706	They are considering launching their own Netflix type subscription service to do video games.
3689466	3715093	which I mean they're really leaning back more towards streaming games but their president Sumi Shuji basically were saying that subscription products are quote very interesting and the firm is quote evaluating some opportunities they can't disclose anything right now but this is looking to be like a path that they would want to take that it would
3716253	3743489	um have a subscription for it so that there's a constant influx of money for people who are on those games um and uh but I I don't know that a subscription service would really be the thing I think that they're doing well by going through Twitch for some of their bringing back their old games but they are but uh he also was saying that uh
3746056	3754543	that he wanted to say that the company had lost its way and he said he wants to make Sega shiny again.
3756845	3767535	They've been putting too much focus on success in Japan and are really trying to push back toward the global stage and that quote Sega has somehow lost confidence.
3768781	3789287	um so they want to bring back that rock and roll mentality to gaming well and you know again to go back to something that came up earlier Sonic 3 beat the Lion King at the box office this weekend I mean that should show that people here give a shit about you know at least one big Sega IP and I think there's a lot of there's a lot of Sega love in this country for a lot of different stuff so
3791239	3794983	Yeah, I hate it when these companies get way too focused on Japan and don't see the rest of the world.
3795003	3796604	Maybe I'm just biased because I don't live in Japan.
3796644	3797045	I live here.
3797525	3809156	But I feel like this also kind of goes back to like old Konami and what bugged me about them and certain other companies that kind of get too focused on one area and lose sight of the rest of the world, which is unfortunate.
3810708	3821254	I personally enjoy games that are geared toward the Japanese audiences because I find them more engaging than just the same stuff I could watch on TV or in a movie in the US.
3821514	3824836	Sure, but you still have to release them here and try to attempt to market them here.
3826257	3826737	Well, yeah.
3828408	3840794	I'm going to chat also, you know, Dark Tootsie brings up the recent delisting of all the classic Sega games pointing out over twitch.tv slash VOG Network would definitely track with everything that just got delisted.
3841174	3842274	Color me optimistic.
3842394	3849798	I hope it turns out good so that maybe part of why all these old games get delisted is to feed into a new subscription style service.
3850918	3852820	I agree with SSJ100, Matt.
3853040	3855342	I refuse to sign it forward unless it's called the Sega Channel.
3856343	3858885	Actually, that would be kind of rad if they brought back the Sega Channel.
3858925	3859305	Why not?
3861107	3862948	Sega's supposed to be bringing back all their... Own the name!
3863028	3864109	Yeah, go for it.
3864229	3864870	That would be rad.
3866971	3869814	Well, meanwhile, what's going on at the Sony Channel, Loki?
3871455	3876560	You know, they're just purchasing shares in companies to have the largest stake in those.
3876620	3881884	This was a rumor, I think, on our last episode before the break, so I think we finally have some clarity on where this all ended up.
3882645	3898158	Yeah, so Sony now has purchased, or is now the largest shareholder of Kedokawa, the company that's, of course, a parent company from software, as well as many other animation and video...
3900092	3901654	I'm sure there's books as well.
3901714	3914370	And yeah, it says in the future, it says the two companies plan to discuss specific initiatives for collaborations such as initiatives to adapt Kadokawa's IP into live action films, TV dramas.
3914630	3917974	Hey, you got to do something after, you know, all those Spider-Man movies or
3918855	3920836	done so well in the box office.
3921356	3921556	What?
3922017	3927119	I'm surprised that Craven the Hunter wasn't the number one film of the week.
3927880	3928840	That's a shock.
3930601	3936504	They're going to also co-produce Anime Works, expand global distribution, and all sorts of other things.
3937865	3940526	So, yeah, we'll see.
3940726	3946309	I'm sure none of that's going to be making Elder Green exclusive to the PlayStation platforms, which it already is, but, you know.
3950583	3954185	Alright, I'm sure nothing evil is going to happen.
3954305	3956767	No, nothing evil will happen out of this.
3956787	3960469	We should do a scale.
3960489	3963291	0 to 10, or 1 to 10.
3963391	3965072	How evil is this going to be?
3966273	3967074	I give it a good solid 7.
3967394	3970616	Oh yeah, 7?
3972297	3970616	6?
3972617	3976540	Well, as 200 Matt points out, at least it wasn't the Tencent or the Saudi Investment Fund.
3977060	3977840	True.
3978081	3978961	That's how you get an 8 or a 9.
3979141	3979622	Could be worse.
3981072	3982072	Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite
4004622	4012770	Marvel vs. Capcom, Infinite and Beyond is a new mod that's coming, and it's actually releasing, I believe, this week.
4013611	4022160	So it was just announced, the mod project that's being led is... And I actually was watching Alan...
4022660	4025582	Watch a streamer playing a little bit of this this week.
4025642	4026763	And so I was like, what is this?
4026783	4028944	Because this isn't looking... It was this whole thing.
4029405	4035148	So apparently there were about 40 people working on this mod after about eight months.
4035489	4041713	And a streamer, Maximilian, spent $30,000 of his own money to help make this a reality.
4041793	4044395	And this is something you can't profit off this, right?
4044435	4045055	When it's a mod.
4045415	4048457	Because you can land in a lot of hot water with Capcom.
4048497	4051419	So this is definitely giving back some of that streamer money.
4051459	4052140	So that's pretty cool.
4052640	4077782	so the mod did come out on Friday at least that was when it's scheduled to come out was December 20th for the PC version of Marvel Infinite on Steam and by the way it was on sale I don't know if it still is on sale but that's pretty cool so yeah and there's a whole I guess they're adding new characters to it and this whole thing so it's pretty cool you just love to see like that type of life get put into an old game there so
4079108	4085572	SG100 Matt says, I would like to see the MVC Infinite sales numbers during the Steam sales because of it.
4085913	4095439	And maybe that's a really good point as to why Capcom just kind of probably turns and looks the other way is because for all intents and purposes, this game was done.
4095499	4097580	They weren't going to sell any more copies of this game.
4097921	4105045	But now because of this mod project coming out, I think it's creating a lot of new interest in the game and it's probably going to sell more copies than it wouldn't before.
4105626	4107607	PodCulture says it is on sale right now for $11.99.
4109248	4110771	That's a pretty reasonable price.
4111271	4113214	So very interesting.
4114296	4115217	Good job, modders.
4115918	4122287	And Mike Deft is giving kudos to Maximilian Dude for doing this, for financing it in our chat.
4122567	4123609	So there you go.
4124534	4131683	Alright, let's travel back to a simpler time when I was going to say you didn't really mod games, but no, modders have always been around.
4131783	4138371	So we're just going to travel back to a time when it probably would cost a lot more money and a lot more time to get these games modded.
4138951	4140373	It's the classic game of the week.
4140433	4141074	Here is the bump.
4151607	4158910	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4159370	4161972	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4163092	4170055	Alright, and DarkSakura, you said you wanted a little audio with this week's pick, so I'm gonna get this queued up here and here you go.
4170095	4171056	Just the beginning of it.
4171076	4172236	I'm gonna give you a little audio, okay?
4172256	4172516	You ready?
4172536	4172876	Here we go.
4173897	4174077	Yep.
4178148	4179929	Can you guess what it is, people who are watching?
4179989	4183371	Well, you see, it's very easy to tell based off the video.
4184572	4187534	Yes, it is Home Alone for the SNES.
4188354	4196699	And I remember playing this game when it came out because my mom, against my suggestions, picked it up for my brothers.
4197320	4198661	And it was oddly addicting.
4199001	4199161	So...
4203163	4209332	The Home Alone was based, of course, on the movie that came out in 1990.
4210974	4215280	I did not realize, though, until like today that it was written by John Hughes.
4215921	4217263	You know, so this Hughes movie.
4219645	4238412	but there were all kinds of variants that came out I linked the SNES copy but there were multiple different versions of the game but it all follows the same plot about Kevin McAllister being left at home when his family goes to Paris and he has to prevent the wet bandits from burglarizing his home and he sets up traps
4239776	4259211	so these versions came out on the NES, the Game Boy, Super Nintendo, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis, the Game Gear, the Amiga and MS-DOS platforms released between 1991 and 1992 and each of them play a little bit differently
4260237	4272363	So for the SNES, you have to evade the Wet Bandits and bring all of the Macalester's fortunes down into the safe room in the basement.
4272523	4280267	And then once they're there, then Kevin has to run past rats, bats, spiders, and ghosts in the basement and then fight a boss so he can make it to the safe room.
4283443	4299959	that doesn't happen in the movie for the record the PC version you were given between from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock which is about 5 minutes of real game time to set up traps to hurt the wet bandits after that period
4301792	4323748	you have to activate the trap once and they all inflict one point of damage so you have to basically you can trigger some of them yourself but you need to have the guys trigger the traps too so for the NES you have to avoid being captured for 20 minutes and you can set traps during the house with different strengths and yeah
4325158	4351056	for the Sega platforms they're kind of different they have more about the the traps and protecting the house while waiting 20 minutes for the police to arrive or 40 on higher difficulties and so they go around the neighborhood in their van deciding to go into another house and so you can travel by your sled to these houses and battle the bandits and yeah it doesn't make sense
4351616	4356420	I mean, just every one of these has very, very different kinds of gameplays.
4358781	4363905	There was, this was released by Bethesda Softworks in 1991.
4364025	4369169	I'm going to go with the first iteration of the game.
4370382	4397721	but it had many other publishers there was THQ, there was Altron, Sega, Capstone Software but it was developed by Bethesda and Sega, Imagineering Inc, Probe Software and Manly and Associates for Amiga DOS so all for their different systems as far as how these games were received I'm going to quote Amanda Dyson of Mega
4399404	4399544	Yikes.
4409466	4409986	Burn!
4411327	4415589	Megatech said the game would appeal to junior players, which is fine.
4415949	4416790	My brothers played it.
4416830	4417710	It was good for them.
4418470	4428395	EGM said the Game Boy version was averaged to low and saying that the gameplay was slow and tedious and that it lacked variety and had very plain graphics.
4428956	4435119	Sega Masterforce said the Master System was great for the graphics being crisp and clear and the music was catchy.
4435919	4438601	Although the levels were just really basic.
4440042	4441283	But you could get the hang of it.
4441903	4450609	The game sold 50,000 units and Sega's version was considered one of the best.
4451310	4452590	I don't remember this part of the game.
4453411	4453931	Pretty sad.
4453951	4454131	LOL ads.
4456861	4457402	Oh, God.
4458002	4463227	And this is the part where Kevin McAllister gets his army and attacks the other army.
4463247	4467310	This is the part where Kevin plays a game that looks nothing like the game that you actually download on your mobile phone.
4468772	4468992	Yeah.
4469953	4473716	But, I mean, it was fun for a hot minute.
4473796	4478981	You know, we played... It was mostly my brothers who were super into it, you know.
4480002	4480082	Um...
4482580	4482980	I don't know.
4483680	4484881	I mean, they were kids.
4485401	4486562	They were preteens.
4487962	4489323	I read through this from Blockbuster.
4491324	4495405	I thought that the likenesses of the characters were pretty decent, you know?
4496246	4503349	But I just like that the whole discussing their evil plot was to the dance of the sugarplum fairy.
4503369	4503449	Yeah.
4504725	4517310	and always now I associate that with bad guys ever since I was also playing Hatoful Boyfriend and when Dr. Iwamine would show up his music was the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.
4518650	4522912	So I now associate that with bad guys in video games around the holidays.
4525713	4530395	So but you know while my brothers were playing Home Alone I was playing Late to the Past.
4530795	4530915	Mm-hmm.
4532344	4532684	All right.
4533085	4533645	But there you go.
4534025	4534445	There it is.
4534485	4536247	I figured it's holiday themed.
4536747	4537387	This is timely.
4537427	4538028	It's very timely.
4538548	4543031	I almost picked like a Gremlins game, but I was like, I'll save that one for next year, maybe.
4544572	4548815	But I just love that there's a giant vault with all the treasures.
4549595	4550816	That was totally in their house.
4551056	4552037	It's totally, totally.
4552697	4556640	But I like the little shots from the movie to the digitized shots with the, yes!
4557640	4558961	That's begging to be memed.
4558981	4559662	Yeah.
4561590	4584913	I love it yeah you know and people often forget you know who played the mom in that movie Catherine O'Hara that's right Catherine O'Hara or you know Moira from Schitt's Creek or a variety obviously you know believe she's SCTV I've never watched Schitt's Creek right oh that show is so funny but um she is Mrs. Dietz yes all of that all of it so uh did you see Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Rob
4585593	4586674	No, I did not see the sequel.
4586714	4587715	That was the other movie.
4587735	4589236	That was actually the last movie I saw.
4590457	4591157	You need to see it.
4591237	4592238	Is that on streaming yet?
4592878	4593359	Gotta be, right?
4593379	4593899	I can find out.
4593919	4594620	It's been a few months.
4594720	4595220	Probably.
4595240	4596001	I think they come out.
4596021	4596541	I think it's on DVD.
4596561	4596761	120 days.
4596801	4597061	DVD, Loki?
4597081	4597862	DVD, Grandpa?
4603052	4606096	Hey, I don't know that because I was looking for a DVD.
4606156	4611383	I know that because I follow, what was it, Wario64 or whatever that posts deals.
4611563	4611783	Yeah.
4611843	4615308	And that was one of the deals that was posted, so that's how I know.
4615828	4616069	Funny.
4616229	4616569	Rob.
4616710	4616870	What?
4618010	4645844	If you still have access to the OLR account that I made for sharing my apps on that little Mac Mini that we used to run on Oh, probably, yeah You have access to my entire movie library I should log into that thing once in a while Maybe I should hook it up downstairs as like a media server That probably wouldn't be a bad idea You totally have access to my entire movie library Including Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Alien Romulus, all of that
4647085	4647525	No one knows.
4647545	4648086	No, no, no.
4648146	4649067	You can't delete anything.
4649107	4649747	I own it forever.
4650668	4651769	I'm just messing.
4652650	4653290	And guess what?
4653911	4654811	No one else has this.
4654831	4656493	All right.
4657474	4661257	Let's check in on a few other couple quick headlines.
4661277	4664579	We don't have a lot of big news stories left, but we do have a few headlines here.
4664599	4666321	So let's do some rapid fire news, Loki.
4667629	4680535	Well, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie was going to do well, and they kind of already figured that out even before I think it came out, because Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is now also greenlit, and it's supposed to be hitting theaters in 2027.
4680615	4685097	Without spoiling anything, even I heard there's a pretty major teaser at the end of the movie.
4685438	4685878	There is.
4686018	4686798	Yes, there is.
4687118	4691861	It makes it very clear what's going to happen, or a character that's coming to the fourth movie.
4692161	4692341	Yeah.
4693081	4694282	Yes, a character.
4694742	4695943	Mm-hmm.
4695963	4696203	Mm-hmm.
4696563	4696683	Mm-hmm.
4697229	4722085	and then along with that there's also season 2 of Amazon's Secret Level which Secret Level was alright the latter half of the episodes were kind of disappointing I think a lot of it was just that it's very short some of these that I was really excited about like the Mega Man one
4723317	4724578	was too short.
4724778	4728299	It was just nothing happens and then it's over already.
4728399	4729579	It's like five minutes later.
4731340	4743665	So, but good to see that they're going to be bringing back a season two and hopefully we'll get some extensions onto some of these that were set up already, like the Mega Man one and Dungeons and Dragons and stuff like that.
4746039	4752306	Um, I actually, I was going to go over to blue sky because we actually got a question regarding this and I figured I would get it now, uh, here.
4752407	4758193	So Wayne and 12 over on blue sky was asking, did you watch any episodes of secret level on prime video?
4758273	4759375	If so, what did you think of them?
4759735	4761737	I thought the new world episode was pretty good.
4761797	4763740	The Pac-Man episode was definitely something.
4764280	4766603	So that was your review Loki too short.
4767404	4769285	Yeah, it was too short for a lot of them.
4769326	4771147	The New World episode was good.
4772508	4777111	I'm not familiar with New World, but that's the one that Arnold Schwarzenegger voiced a character in.
4777772	4783236	And so that was good, and that was a pretty nice self-contained short, I think.
4783276	4789981	The Pac-Man one is strange, but then, funny enough, there's the... It was like the...
4791918	4797282	Shadow, there's some new Namco game that is essentially that animation as a game.
4797322	4798443	It's like a roguelike game.
4798903	4808390	So that Pac-Man one, if you watch it just as the show itself, it's like, wow, that's a dark take on Pac-Man, which is great.
4808870	4813033	I think it was an interesting take on it, but now there's also going to be a game based off of that.
4813753	4816975	The other ones I watched too, I mean, I watched most of the first
4818036	4818376	Half.
4818476	4821718	So they released it like kind of like seven episodes and eight episodes, I believe.
4822819	4827342	I watched everything but Crossfire because I heard that was terrible.
4828562	4830343	And so I'm trying to think what else.
4830483	4831864	The Dungeons and Dragons was good.
4832404	4835426	That was a good self-contained thing.
4835446	4838728	What was it?
4839829	4842390	Oh gosh, I don't remember the name of the series.
4843511	4843591	Um...
4845551	4865026	Armored Core with Keanu Reeves was awesome like that like that right there should be just proof of concept to make a full movie out of that and the Warhammer 40k stuff was awesome as well those are really good for the second one I really the second half I only watched the Mega Man one and then I kind of like
4865828	4868089	didn't really watch the rest of them.
4868229	4873171	I watched some reviews of those, and they said the second half was not as good.
4873591	4875692	And that kind of tanked the rest of them.
4875752	4879593	So that's unfortunate, but they're not always going to be winners.
4880053	4884735	I really am a big fan of Love, Death, and the Robots.
4884895	4889417	So it's, you know, I'm looking forward to season two.
4889437	4889877	Okay.
4891189	4891409	All right.
4891649	4894530	Well, sorry, we made rapid fire news a little longer there, but I had to ask.
4894870	4896031	Well, you had to ask on Blue Sky.
4896051	4904574	And by the way, if you want to follow us on Blue Sky, our username is OrangeloungeRadio.com because people are still figuring out that you can have your domain as a username on Blue Sky.
4904594	4907496	So just look up OrangeloungeRadio.com on Blue Sky and you can follow us.
4907516	4913658	You can also follow us on Discord where we take suggestions throughout the week over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.
4913678	4915979	That's VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.
4915999	4918140	Okay, we have a couple other quick headlines for you.
4918180	4918540	Dark Sakura.
4920407	4924429	So I'd like to say happy birthday to Snatcher.
4926330	4928111	It actually was the U.S.
4928352	4933415	release of Snatcher, the only one that made it out over here.
4935035	4944641	It came out first off for the PC-98 and MSX2 in Japan 1988 and got a very big following.
4945321	4947443	I mean, who today doesn't know what Snatcher is?
4948383	4968834	um but at any rate um there was one English release version in 1994 December for the Sega CD or Mega CD um and uh it was and good luck finding an affordable one question mark and tarabang but there are
4970511	4981542	They had some issues with some of the legal, like they had to take Kamen Rider out and some of the other Konami characters and changing the age of a character to 18.
4981622	4988309	Light gun segments, yeah, and different voice acting, of course.
4988349	4990150	They had to do a lot to it to make it happen.
4990891	5012249	but they put a lot of energy time and money into bringing this game out and the game sold at most 2,000 copies in the US region and it didn't do very well but it's one of like those special games you get your hands on it and and heck I mean it's uh
5013630	5018172	I really wish that it had done better over here.
5019693	5027917	But there is a little chance of it being re-released, but there are fan translations that do a really good job of it.
5028897	5030998	And that's for the Saturn versions and whatnot.
5031399	5039923	But Snatcher is just one of those glorious cyberpunk games that is just totally... I'm down for it.
5040323	5040503	I mean,
5042702	5047706	And even little things from this and police knots have made it into the Metal Gear series and other Konami series.
5050000	5050180	All right.
5050200	5054682	Well, one other quick story for you that has to do with a new patch for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
5055143	5055423	You know what?
5055443	5060225	If the game moved too slow for you because, you know, you can easily spend 100 hours plus on this game.
5060625	5063347	This new patch will allow you to speed up cut scenes.
5063527	5063987	That's right.
5064727	5066408	The way some of you listen to your podcasts.
5066928	5069630	I wonder how many people out there listen to OLR on 1.5 speed.
5069690	5070410	I know there's a few.
5070850	5073312	So you can now play Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on 1.5 speed.
5074532	5094916	that's right they have implemented a fast forward feature for cut scenes that allows you to watch scenes without skipping them but you can play them at 1.5 times or 2.0 times speed and some clips were shared on social media to which people responded why would you want to fast forward through any of this masterpiece you should experience every second of it
5096738	5098661	But some of us don't have that kind of time.
5100283	5102667	And I imagine it might depend on which scene it is, too.
5102707	5103909	You might want to fast forward through.
5104009	5106432	So kind of an interesting little feature.
5106853	5107254	Nothing else.
5108188	5117511	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, or as is probably the case this week, lack thereof, but sometimes things get through.
5118491	5120431	Loki, anything to talk about this week in the US?
5120592	5122092	There's nothing coming out this week.
5122312	5123992	Yeah, I figured that might be the case.
5124513	5128994	And if I'm not mistaken, DarkSakura, it's the same thing over in the UK, isn't it?
5129943	5130784	Thanks for watching!
5146519	5147820	Why did I associate that?
5147840	5148360	Alright, forget it.
5148801	5160850	Anyway, Nintendo Switch games coming out on the 26th include Dawning Subaru and The Owl Lurking in the Twilight in a regular and a limited edition.
5161230	5164893	That is the lone Switch release this week, but if you want to go over to the PlayStation 5...
5165854	5190288	Biohazard 7, Resident Evil, which y'all know what that is over here That is getting a Gold Edition release this week As well as Biohazard, Resident Evil 2 and 3 get the Z version releases I don't know if these are like price reductions or if they actually added anything to them But those are out on the 26th this week as well And that is it So it's a very, very slow week But at least something's happening
5191728	5196453	Did you also know that the Mac OS version just came out?
5196893	5197474	Oh, no, I didn't.
5197494	5198315	That's so neat.
5198735	5201438	Yeah, it's in the App Store.
5201958	5202439	Very cool.
5203380	5203680	All right.
5204884	5210507	Well, with that, that takes us to the listener roundtable where we take your comments and questions.
5210547	5216050	And we would invite phone calls as well if anybody wants to call in over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.
5216770	5218271	I will also check on emails.
5218651	5221993	I don't know if we've gotten any in the last three weeks, but I'll check in anyway.
5222373	5225335	Participate at orangetontrader.com is the place to send emails.
5226630	5227731	Yeah, there's nothing.
5227871	5228171	Nothing.
5228311	5228572	All right.
5228992	5231734	And then I think we addressed the blue sky comment we got.
5231754	5238019	There was another one that was asking us about that NFT story that we already went over a little bit ago.
5239840	5241201	Yeah, so that was that story.
5241281	5243743	Thank you, SGO and Hunter Matt, for submitting that anyway.
5244203	5245144	I will point this out.
5245244	5254771	So this wasn't something we were off when this all went down, but I made some posts over on our blue sky about... Where did it go?
5256425	5267650	Oh, we were talking about OLRPSP.com because the PlayStation Portable celebrated, I think it was its 20th birthday over our little break.
5267730	5273773	And I made a little comment like, congratulations to OLRPSP.com, which by the way, does still exist.
5274193	5278754	Still, you can't get it at olrpsp.com because we let the domain expire.
5279194	5284316	But if you type the full orangedauntradio.com slash PSP, you can get to it that way.
5284616	5292438	Or Dark Tetsuya reminded me, he made one of those bit.ly, so bit.ly slash olrpsp.
5292858	5294218	A little bit shorter of an address as well.
5294658	5296319	And the hilarious thing is...
5297139	5297940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5315297	5319781	But yeah, the backgrounds are all still there and everything that Loki put into the site.
5320062	5330651	And we actually did get a reply over on Blue Sky from Bryguy who said, I found this show thanks to the PSP when they had that internet radio update all those years ago.
5331152	5337037	I'd stay up late every Sunday night, thanks East Coast time, with my PSP hidden under my pillow and headphones.
5337398	5338559	Been a listener ever since.
5339079	5367718	that's oh that you were probably way too young to be listening to this but I think but that's a rad story thank you so much for sharing that's really cool yeah olrpsp.com was still probably either that or the day that Apple launched podcasts is probably still the number one for what brought listeners into this show but that would probably be number two is olrpsp.com so good job Loki why didn't we ever get olrp we still have a demo disc that was attached to that katamari
5369232	5370253	Why didn't we ever get what?
5370413	5371133	OLR Vita.
5371574	5372174	And I was teasing.
5372875	5374216	It wasn't the same.
5374456	5377818	Because it didn't really offer anything.
5378058	5378499	No, I know.
5378519	5379820	There wasn't anything special you could do there.
5380060	5380540	No, I know.
5380600	5380901	It worked.
5381061	5383823	It was very different in the way it worked or didn't work.
5384904	5403116	um all right well with that I know it's a little bit shorter of a show but that's the way it's gonna work I do have a last minute story oh I'd love to hear a couple last minute stories yeah let's do it so go for it let's talk game industry and and like all the numbers and everything so uh we have a couple things first off Nintendo Switch has now officially outsold the PlayStation 2 in the U.S.
5403356	5409901	wow it is now the second in all time units uh sold across video game hardware platforms in the U.S.,
5410661	5418473	so that's pretty cool I think it's only being beat by itself right now um yeah trailing only to the Nintendo DS
5419585	5421787	Well, I guess that's fine.
5423908	5433315	And then the game industry biz put out their year in numbers, 2024, showing the entire makeup of the game industry.
5433435	5438879	So numbers wise, of course, the total industry is $184.3 billion, which is a 0.2 year over year
5445363	5445703	and so on.
5469660	5479090	Talking about the console market, box versus digital worldwide, 16% box copies, 84% digital sales.
5480031	5487238	PC, not a surprise, 1%, 99%, because I don't even think they sell PC games really in stores anymore.
5487438	5488219	Yeah, very hard.
5489660	5510532	Top selling games in the US, we had EA Sports College Football 25, Call of Duty Black Ops 6, Helldivers 2, Dragon Ball Sparking 0, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and then of course Madden EA Sports FC 25, EA Sports MVP Bundle, Elden Ring, and Dragon's Dogma 2.
5511492	5537043	um you know just real quick that um college football being the number one selling game that was a little bit of a meme on Bobby's show while we were out because I didn't realize this that game with as well as it's done and a lot of people agree it's a pretty solid you know return to that franchise because EA hasn't put out one of those I can't believe I'm talking about sports games but I am um the EA hasn't put out one of those games in a very long time apparently pretty well received did not even get nominated for the game awards in the sports category
5538362	5567471	and so it's a big like WTF type of situation so oh Ranma just gave us a cheer thank you Ranma appreciate the bitties but saying greetings from JFK airport I'm still not in Orlando yet are the airports fucky today because I have a friend that's trying to get home and apparently the airports are extremely fucky today like it's happening everywhere so that's a bummer I hope you hang it up Ranma says yes hang in there Ranma hang in there
5569224	5593349	Newark fucked me oh god so if you're at JFK you originally went over to New York oh boy oh boy he hit all it's funny to look at like what's best selling in Japan too so Japan Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake was number one Super Mario Party Jamboree Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Super Mario Brothers Wonder and
5594409	5621755	Momotaro Densetsu World Number 5 Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Number 6 Animal Crossing New Horizons Number 7 Powerful Pro Yaku 2425 Baseball Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom and Minecraft Switch Edition That's almost all Nintendo That's ridiculous Alright Any other last minute stories for us?
5622642	5623936	That is it.
5624813	5626534	Well, with that, we're going to wrap it up.
5626654	5629936	Thank you so much for being here tonight, especially after we were off on a little break.
5630276	5635019	We don't like being gone for two weeks, but we really appreciate those of you that turned out, whether you're live tonight or on the podcast feed.
5635359	5636840	Thank you for joining us once again.
5636920	5638121	We will be back next week.
5638842	5649328	I expect this week's going to be even slower than this last week was, but we'll be fielding your questions and taking up time the way we know how to do best with many tangent trains, if necessary.
5650168	5652370	Maybe we'll have to do a TikTok on the day.
5653331	5655293	If we're still doing our Chinese food.
5655874	5660240	Yes, but I need to talk to you about the timing on that because I have to juggle with plans with my dad.
5660621	5661482	Okay.
5661622	5662383	All right.
5662424	5666610	But anyway, thank you all so much for downloading our show and listening to it or listening live.
5666650	5668933	However you are here at Orange Lounge Radio, thank you for being a part of it.
5669273	5671594	If you enjoyed what you heard here, help us spread the word.
5672054	5674955	Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5675095	5676576	We need more voices to put out on air.
5676976	5682678	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or YouTube, wherever it is you found this show.
5683018	5684518	It goes an awful long way.
5684598	5692401	Thank you so much to all of you for being here despite the times that we kind of come and go a little bit sometimes.
5692781	5695162	So anyway, with that, let's get around to everybody's final thought.
5695202	5696862	Dark Sakura, you are streaming tonight.
5696902	5698283	You're playing Dragon Age tonight.
5698863	5705507	I'm going to play Dragon Age tonight, and I am going to be taking out this stitch myself tomorrow so I can play Dead by Daylight.
5705807	5706108	All right.
5707509	5710831	Like, why should I go to the doctor to pull out one stitch, right?
5711791	5713672	As long as you're confident in doing it.
5713712	5714033	Ranma.
5714653	5718415	I know Ranma Nibunoichi was renewed for a second season.
5718515	5718936	I'm happy.
5720257	5720437	All right.
5720497	5722038	Any other final thoughts for us?
5723479	5726420	I need more chocolate in my life.
5727121	5727381	All right.
5728206	5730287	Alright, we'll rage you in a little bit, but have a good night.
5732068	5732268	Bye!
5733188	5734409	Loki, that means it's over to you.
5734489	5735209	Your final thought tonight.
5736470	5740872	I'm still working hard on Minecraft stuff.
5741755	5745499	trying to get this ride done, making good progress to kind of the end there.
5745759	5747701	I saw you putting some greatest hits on Blue Sky.
5747741	5750583	I saw the Skibbity Toilet video was up there.
5750603	5751264	I keep forgetting.
5751364	5756709	I started doing a Flashback Friday thing, and I've forgotten in a few weeks, and so I had to remember.
5756929	5761594	I'm also running out of things to put up there, so it's like, you know, I'll build more things.
5761794	5762875	Yeah, no, keep it up.
5763598	5771948	Alright, and then my final thought is, yeah, have whatever it is you celebrate this week, whether it's Christmas or Hanukkah or Kwanzaa or all of it or none of it.
5772008	5773049	I hope you all have a great week.
5773190	5779197	I hope you enjoy, are safe, enjoy the sales, enjoy catching up on your backlog, and thank you so much for
5779737	5781938	for being a part of our lives here in 2024.
5782818	5784238	So with that, that's it.
5784338	5794761	We'll see you in seven days to talk about the year wrap up, I guess, and whatever else awaits us in gaming in this next week because gamers can never stay quiet an entire week.
5795141	5797742	So we'll be here to catch up on the news next week.
5797802	5802023	Until then, have a wonderful and safe week and we'll see you next time.
5802483	5802823	Bye-bye.
