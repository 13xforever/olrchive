10254	15155	Quote Sega President Shuji Utsumi regarding another Sega mini-console, I'm not going for the mini-direction.
15275	15776	It's not me.
15916	17256	I want to embrace modern games.
17356	18597	We are not a retro company.
18877	24759	I get why he said this, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to laugh the next time a Sonic, Sega, or other classic gamer collection hits the game stores.
25199	26759	Do remasters count as retro games?
27640	29460	This is the Past is Greater in Your Mind intro.
29660	34782	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you one more sentence in this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35102	37183	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
40066	42547	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
42607	47108	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47208	60690	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again on this merry happy week, December 29th, 2024 with episode number 1029 of our show.
61131	64331	My name is Rob Roberts and I am here joined by my co-hosts.
64471	67652	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69022	69682	Happy Hanukkah.
70083	70803	Hello, hello.
70863	71684	Happy Hanukkah to you.
71744	77167	I love the shirt your VTuber is wearing tonight saying, feed me Lakas and tell me I'm pretty.
78788	78988	Yep.
79348	79549	Yes.
80429	81770	Just feed me Lakas, really.
82330	85592	The way it comes through on OLR stream, I know yours is mirrored.
85632	88354	It's not on OLR, probably because of Discord integration and all that.
88394	90996	But I assure you that's what it says.
93135	94976	Yeah, I had to do some shenanigans.
95016	99898	Like, I'm looking at Discord right now, and it's the correct direction.
100118	100779	Oh, interesting.
101359	101699	Interesting.
101739	106241	I can probably flip your screen or something in Discord, but I just... Discord should be reversed.
106441	107682	Well, hello, Tech Master Loki.
108822	113725	Right, I had to reverse it coming out of my thing.
113965	114405	Interesting.
114425	115165	Whatever my thing is.
116126	116426	OBS.
117006	117807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
135209	136250	and DarkSakura.com.
151596	162578	He pre-ordered that for my birthday, and we didn't think they were coming until early 2025, but it actually showed up somewhere around Thanksgiving when he was sick, then I was sick, then I went to Memphis.
162858	164538	So finally, we got the shelving built, and it's all set up.
164578	168199	And I will say, this thing is super cute, this Evercade Alpha that plays.
168439	176060	It has the Capcom games built into it, so it has Mega Man, Power Battle, Mega Man Power Battle 2, Striders in it, which is pretty rad.
176100	179561	I know that's one of Jamie's favorites, and Final Fight.
179901	181462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
205262	207964	It's like a console more type of thing.
208384	218171	I bought the Namco 1 and 2 cartridges and they don't play on the Versys because they say, oh, these are not licensed for this, which I kind of think is pretty bullshit.
218431	223394	And I guess they are the only cartridges in the Evercade system that don't do that.
224495	227137	And I do feel that's really bullshit.
227517	229839	And I understand it's probably out of Evercade's control.
230319	231280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
249318	277806	so right now I have my Namco cartridges plugged in there and the other night I was playing Dragon Spirit although I was a little I was like oh it's not the Dragon Spirit arcade version it's the Dragon Spirit NES port which wasn't quite the same it's not bad but it's I was like oh it's a little different so yeah so that's my that's my Capcom Namco cabinet right now that's that's joining me in the office but it's I'm now officially out of room although
279577	281101	Jamie, you could probably appreciate this.
281141	282444	Do you know what Alan's talking about doing?
282484	283347	You know what Alan wants to do?
285318	310173	he wants to just get rid of the kitchen which is or the I should say the dining room not the kitchen sorry the kitchen table in the dining room um because uh we don't we know what's in my dining room right pinball machines I know that's why I'm saying you know not to add not to you know what I'm gonna say yeah now I have well he said he said if we get rid of the dining table in the day because we don't use it we're it's just the two of us we don't sit down for fancy dining
310613	334384	we you know if anything um we're gonna use uh you know the living room or something and so it's just this is how we are right we're that kind of family it's us and the cats so he's like if we get rid of that we can put more machines down there and I was like oh boy I was like just what we need I'm like don't tell Jamie because she'll try she'll try to store a pinball machine here
337078	340221	You know, we have plenty to lend out.
340681	343703	How would you like to hold on to a Doctor Who for a hot minute?
343923	346345	Oh, pod culture would find my house and burn it down.
347766	348927	Not with my pinball in it.
349688	350788	He'd take it out first.
351689	352730	And the cats, to be fair.
353430	354511	All right.
355612	363418	Anyway, go into our chat room because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vognetwork.com.
363678	387285	Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific Again at twitch.tv slash VOG Network Bobby Blackwolf sadly not on tonight as well He kind of ran into the reverse situation that I had a couple weeks ago So he doesn't like to announce when he goes on a trip But now that he's back, he was on a trip, that's where he was last week And unfortunately he got sick after the trip
387825	390466	Whereas with me, I got sick and then I went on a trip.
390726	394928	So, you know, that's, I guess, just the VOG Network way right now.
394948	396609	But feel better soon, Bobby Blackwolf.
396889	398750	My understanding is he is doing better today.
399511	402732	But just the voice is kind of the last thing to recover.
402832	406054	And talking for an hour was not a good idea.
406194	407314	So I can respect that.
407354	412697	So we'll look forward to Bobby's return next week here at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
413437	413737	Let's see.
413777	416579	PodCulture says, hell no, I'd set the high score.
417239	420101	Oh, that would be fair revenge for speaking of Bobby Blackwolf.
420121	423483	That would be some fair revenge to things that I've done.
424764	425545	I don't think so.
425565	431729	There are people I really truly do not believe are going to beat some of the high scores at my house.
431749	434431	Well, do the high scores reset when you unplug it?
434711	437593	When you unplug it and plug it back in, does the high score reset?
437653	440075	Or is there memory that it saves to?
440115	441435	I think you have to manually do it.
441736	441976	Okay.
441996	442076	Okay.
443590	447932	So, um, well then, yeah, you probably wouldn't beat those scores unless it reset when you moved it.
448853	449293	Um, let's see.
449773	461660	Uh, Darted Sia says, if I had the funds, I'd be tempted to look into one of those at games or one up pinball machines, but we have pinball FX on the PS five of the interim, you know, speaking of Bobby and he's talked about this on his show.
461720	464982	And I think, I want to say he did a little video tour at some point in the past.
465502	473307	He has some really nice, like, multi-cade machines that he bought from a local Atlantic company that I know always shows at Southern Fried Game Expo.
473327	475508	And I'm sorry, of course, at the moment, I don't remember the name of the company.
475548	475788	Sorry.
476269	477870	But I do know the machines are nice.
478350	481292	And he has one that is like a multi-arcade machine.
481612	483033	And then he has another that's pinball.
483073	485374	And it's like virtual pinball with the table laid down.
485434	488576	And, you know, I understand, you know, virtual pinball is kind of its own.
488616	490958	But for what it is, it's very nice.
491918	492198	So...
494360	499143	I would be tempted to get one of those machines, but I actually am not sure that there's still enough room.
499663	501905	We have a California house, people.
501965	502785	It's pretty small.
502865	504907	A little townhouse.
505347	510030	Someday we'll move, and then I will have my dedicated game room and look out.
512076	512816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
533622	537623	SSJ100 Matt says, where do guests eat when you have house parties when there is no tables?
537984	538924	Too bad, so sad.
538964	541065	Around here we eat with our hands like Americans.
541485	559111	Yeah, I was going to say, I don't, I can't, I can't think of the last time I went to a dinner party where everybody sat around the table and ate that wasn't A, Thanksgiving, which, you know, okay, that makes sense, or B, at a restaurant.
560532	585402	I can't think of the last time I was at a party where everybody sat down to eat like that maybe I'm just hanging with a weird crowd I don't know but I don't think so I like my peeps so that's that all right um I want to start hosting tea parties like actual tea parties that'd be fun yeah why not what kind of tea you gonna serve all the tea it'll be the hot tea hot tea the piping hot kind
586521	590282	S2100 Matt says, ain't no dinner party better than a home arcade party.
590402	592843	Yes, but no kids.
593563	594163	I'm sorry to say.
594183	596284	Well, maybe over a certain age.
596884	602206	You know, I'd have to vet them child by child to make sure that.
602967	606130	They know how to behave around arcade machines.
606330	609293	But that would be my one thing.
610655	613197	Like, you know, Loki's kids at this point are old enough.
613378	614699	I don't think they would wreck a machine.
614799	617302	But, you know, some kids don't know the difference yet.
617402	619284	No, they wouldn't.
619364	620765	They also probably wouldn't be interested.
621686	622187	That's fair.
622227	622968	That's fair, too.
625094	627335	Arcade Machines, that's Dad's thing, yeah.
628616	639903	I mean, they would probably play some, like if we had a racing cabinet or the Jurassic Park game, they'd probably play it for a little bit, but then they'd get bored pretty quick.
639983	641163	Although, it's hard to say.
642004	645286	My oldest son, yes, would probably get bored of it.
645526	650288	My youngest, though, he's going on these phases where he's trying to...
651440	653260	Questmaster by Apogee
680109	682551	Number one, I didn't realize Apogee was still publishing games.
683431	685633	Did somebody else buy the name or what's the deal there?
685993	686734	I don't know.
686934	687674	Okay, but that's cool.
688535	695140	But it is essentially a legally distinct Link to the Past maker.
696394	722789	it well you know you get those ZZT vibes a little bit but just with maybe some link to the past inspired graphics or you know that whole thing so yeah it's definitely legally distinct sort of thing but it's got a story and it's got a bunch of user made levels now and they're going to be supposedly coming out of early access this year at some point I have it installing to my Steam Deck as we speak
725286	731729	Um, let's see, uh, yeah, DarkTipsTV in chat says, yeah, I was going to say it looks like a Zelda maker, but not copyright infringing.
732289	737791	Um, on the kids and, uh, video games, uh, S200 Matt says, kids will come over and ask where the tickets are.
738171	741813	You know, I, I honestly would think kids would look at these games and go, these are old.
741953	742673	These are boring.
742853	746475	These are, you know, what's, this is it, you know, type of thing.
747155	750597	They don't have that same sentimental attachment to some of these games that...
751697	779810	it depends, like at the arcade they obviously will want to play ticket games because they're looking to win prizes because that's their goals, they're not there to play games they're there to see what they can win in the prize thing yeah, and that's kind of a little different but yeah, they'll play like racing games and stuff, or they'll play probably not like shooter games or anything, but they'll play games just for the fun of it it's just I think given like
781513	803657	they play a lot of Roblox stuff and then like I don't know they're all like kind of into their own things like my oldest son's in the Helldivers 2 like a lot he's played it a ton he's played through Red Dead Redemption 2 like several times already and you know now my oldest son's upset he was obsessed with Zelda stuff and now he's obsessed with Mario Kart now
804368	832432	so it's just that goes in phases but yeah and also my oldest son right now on his computer has AFK like this game called Fish on Roblox which is like some big popular thing now so he's playing that the thing I always see on Roblox is the fashion review yeah yeah there's that and now there's a ballroom simulator thing the old voguing ballroom Paris is Burning type of stuff which I think is it's no ex tango
833362	834563	No, it's no Xtango.
834723	835044	All right.
835965	837446	We should probably get into our kickoff topic.
837486	839408	Let's talk about what is going on in gaming.
839428	841651	We'll talk about more things that we've been playing this week in just a little bit.
842091	844193	But first, let's talk about what is going on in the news.
844714	848598	Obviously, with the holidays, it is a slower news period.
848998	855284	But there are some things going on, including what some sneaky Grinch is trying to do things in a week that nobody's paying attention.
855344	855705	Right, Loki?
856738	861629	Oh yes, it's total Warner Brothers coming at it.
861669	864616	What's Warner Brothers popular for nowadays?
865157	865277	Um...
866701	871462	We're moving things from being viewed for tax purposes, most likely.
872323	881025	So right now they are delisting a bunch of Cartoon Network games off of Steam and the Nintendo eShop.
881725	889947	So they're delisting Adventure Time, there's several Adventure Time games, OK KO Games, Steven Universe, all that stuff.
890327	891088	And they're also...
892782	897184	Removing, I guess, Samurai Jack Battle Through Time has been removed from sale as well.
899385	904848	Yeah, so it says no longer, they will be no longer available for sale after December 23rd.
905288	908310	Signed Cartoon Network Games or Adult Swim Games.
910731	911851	Yeah, I hate Zaslav.
912652	915993	Yeah, and anybody that cares about game preservation has a cry.
916473	917274	Like, it's just...
919102	922805	It shouldn't be this way where they can write these things off in the first place.
923105	924386	I strongly feel that sort of thing.
924406	925326	And I've said this before.
925466	930149	If you do use these things as a tax write-off, then those things belong to the public now.
930269	932191	You've released those things into the public domain.
932471	934112	That is how I strongly believe this should work.
934552	943178	Is that if you are going to tax write-off something like Acme vs. Coyote or whatever that movie was or Batgirl, then those things should belong to the public domain.
943518	947121	Then anybody should be able to broadcast those movies and...
947921	961341	have them because you essentially you're writing it off for public money you should have to release it in the public domain and I think it would make companies think twice about this kind of thing maybe they wouldn't give a shit I don't know but at least we wouldn't lose these games forever
962213	963374	because people worked hard on these.
963394	966196	I mean, were they the most popular games, top-selling games?
966376	969119	No, but someday somebody's going to want to play it.
969139	984872	They're going to be looking into Cartoon Network series and the different spinoffs that have come from it and want to play these games, and they will not be able to without turning to piracy, which these actions literally drive us towards.
986313	986713	Mm-hmm.
986913	987394	Mm-hmm.
987952	1002637	Yeah, and then, you know, because obviously Warner Brothers really is concerned about copyright when it comes to their IP, they had an update or a promotion for a new skin for their... I don't even know what this character is.
1002697	1006498	It's one of the original characters in Multiverses.
1006958	1008559	Some weird, like, dog thing with...
1009682	1013926	Antlers, not really sure what it is, but they had a skin that made it a rain dog.
1015647	1027176	They had a skin that turned it into a unicorn, and so instead of coming up with a unique advertising campaign, they decided to just go ahead and completely rip off Charlie the Unicorn.
1027517	1037525	So not only is the skin called Charlie, but they also stole the audio from Charlie the Unicorn in their promotion video that appeared on Twitter.
1037985	1038286	So...
1039508	1068458	you know of course oddly enough funny I was watching stuff from FilmCow this week because I was like hey I wonder what's up with FilmCow completely independently of all this and funny enough Jason Steele the head of I think the sole person of FilmCow is made a comment regarding Multiverses is a game by Warner Brothers a company with an annual revenue of $40 billion here they are using my work without permission to advertise their game
1069399	1072347	and they essentially used his voice.
1074031	1075916	They said they blatantly stole the audio.
1078032	1079033	That's fucking stupid.
1079573	1084056	Whereas Warner Brothers, of course, I mean, fair is fair, right?
1084296	1088459	So if they use their audio, we can use their audio, right?
1088559	1096164	Oh, no, of course not, because they've also taken down fan works that have used stuff from that as well.
1096244	1098626	So it's kind of hypocritical.
1099186	1104730	The tweet in question with that advertising video has been deleted by Warner Brothers.
1106131	1112775	but of course the internet is the internet so they have archived it and yeah it's
1113991	1115332	It's pretty bad.
1116693	1119875	Why particularly were they trying to add Charlie the Unicorn?
1120075	1123698	My brain goes to, was it like a Robot Unicorn Attack reference?
1124138	1128221	But then if that's the case, you would do the Erasure Song or whatever.
1128261	1129923	They're probably too cheap to license again.
1130363	1132645	Or you would do something in that realm.
1132845	1135887	Because Robot Unicorn Attack was a Cartoon Network thing, right?
1135907	1138289	So therefore it is under WB, could be part of Multiverses.
1138689	1140971	So I could see if it's kind of going that way, but...
1141472	1145570	Why are they so hell-bent on stealing Charlie the Unicorn when it's not even theirs?
1147063	1171293	because they couldn't come up with anything unique they just literally pointed out a unique unicorn that is within their they could have had well they wanted to do this some artist or whatever that worked with them you know essentially did it so yeah the video has been uh like i said it has been taken down but there is it has been someone managed to grab it before it was deleted once on the internet always forever right so they had that but yeah it's it's just
1172714	1189424	it's really dumb like it's just it's completely devoid and like even the video itself is not really transformative they basically steal the audio and it's just their character kind of doing an emote and just standing there while the camera pans between three identical things it's just it's bad
1191229	1197756	Yeah, we're looking at this here live on Twitch as we're broadcasting and it looks like... I gotta say, I will give it this.
1197976	1201220	When I look at this, I don't think Charlie the Unicorn.
1201400	1208527	That kind of doesn't look like the old animation whatsoever, to be honest.
1208607	1210309	It looks like just a unicorn.
1210369	1213472	But if they're using the audio, then that's...
1214153	1218095	much different on, I wonder, yeah, I wonder what the thought process was in that.
1218135	1222937	That just looks like, honestly, that looks like a dog with a party hat.
1224498	1226179	I mean, kind of, yeah.
1227039	1228660	It looks like a dog with a party hat.
1229280	1238064	And, like, he's come out, like, Jason Steele's come out and said, like, he gave examples of other games kind of using the Charlie the Unicorn stuff for, like, you know, more fair use.
1238124	1242166	Like, there's a unicorn, I guess, in World of Warcraft that has an enchanted kidney.
1242786	1245628	You know, a dead unicorn that has an enchanted kidney or something like that.
1245728	1249071	That, you know, is obviously in reference to that.
1249091	1251833	But it's not like straight up stealing his audio.
1251873	1254835	And World of Warcraft has all sorts of like things that toe the line.
1254875	1259559	Like Harris-Pilton was a big meme that sold like a 10,000 gold bag.
1259739	1260619	And Dora Moorhead.
1260859	1262501	Yeah, there's all sorts of little...
1263703	1289210	Warcrafty things that they do that toe the line but yeah they are all they are all well within the lines of parody right so interesting um you know looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network OrangeRite says the intern probably thought it was just a meme and memes are free to use for reasons uh and looks like a Rindog birthday cake yeah that's I OrangeRite I honestly think
1289830	1290130	90 Wife, 90 Kids
1317108	1321230	Yeah, like, I didn't... You know, he got some... He bought a house with what he got.
1321351	1321591	Yeah.
1321871	1324452	Well, I'm thinking success stories, too, a little more recently.
1325073	1325553	What's her name?
1325613	1327634	Jules the... Very demure.
1327974	1328855	Very mindful.
1329175	1330096	Very cutesy.
1330496	1331657	Like, you know, she...
1332577	1334139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1350380	1367273	Um, the, the, the one, the, the girl, the scary girlfriend, the one in the picture like this, this is like, oh, and she was like, yeah, like it's made my dating life, you know, like I, at some point it will come up that that was me in the picture and people think that it's legit, like that whole kind of thing.
1367293	1371476	And then it's like, does somebody like her make money off a picture like that?
1371876	1374118	I mean, maybe the occasional talk show appearance.
1374558	1377881	And if you're really smart from the get go, you print a shirt.
1378201	1388090	You print, you know, you take a saying and you get it on a shirt, which is probably what I'm assuming what Jules did with the Demir and Mindful thing, because I remember there's a whole issue with the trademark and that, right?
1388150	1396397	So she gets, I think she finally wrestled away the trademark for very Demir, very Mindful, and now, you know, makes money with that on products and all that stuff.
1396437	1401321	But some of these people that become these meme stars, they kind of belong to the internet, which is really weird.
1402264	1408066	Yeah, and I mean, you know, hey, it sucks that they can't make that money off of their meme stardom.
1408126	1412828	I mean, how else are they going to be able to do a crypto rug pull if they're not famous from these memes?
1413608	1419870	So... I feel unfortunate for them that they're unable to exploit their fans yet.
1419990	1429393	Then you have people that, like, try too hard to make the money off the memes, like Hak'tu, that whole thing, which I... I'm going to go to sleep now for, like, three weeks.
1429593	1430193	Bye-bye.
1430213	1430233	I...
1432344	1432824	You got me, bitch.
1432844	1433124	You got me.
1457236	1462900	Well, it's unfortunate that these games are being unlisted and we sit here helpless and watching it.
1463221	1464262	What can we do about it?
1464462	1467904	Pirate them, I guess, is really all we can do to keep these games alive.
1467924	1468585	Physical copies.
1468625	1472368	Yeah, physical copies and don't support games, I guess, that are always online.
1472988	1473729	You know, stuff like that.
1473749	1478212	Because, yeah, at least with the physical copies of some of these games, you'd be able to still play them.
1478753	1484397	Although nowadays, like even if you go to the store and buy a physical copy of the game, it's like, oh, here's a download code.
1484477	1484717	It's like...
1485498	1486038	Great, thanks.
1486218	1498243	Wasn't there some game sales report recently that like, if you look at PC game sales, 1% of PC game sales is over the counter.
1498263	1500624	99% is digital because of things like Steam and Epic.
1500864	1503125	But of course, when you look at PC games, I mean...
1504025	1505526	Yeah, that tracks, right?
1505646	1518690	That 1% is probably that one shelf at Target that I don't even know if it exists anymore that has like the Agatha Christie, Bejeweled 70, Nancy Drew games.
1518770	1521931	Like just this very strange hod podge of games.
1522491	1526432	Games for grandma and grandkids.
1526852	1527253	Like I...
1528653	1556440	I don't want to knock those games some people love their Nancy Drew but you know like that's the only stuff that seems to sell physical like obviously everything else is online yeah I mean I've seen that shelf it's like now a shelf at all I don't even know if that exists anymore most of it's like just even if you want a physical game it's all cards nowadays and even it's funny like if you go into the game section like I go to Target every week
1557280	1586540	Killing Time while my son's at his programming class and you look at what they've got on the shelves there's not really a lot of physical copies anywhere they don't really keep a lot of that but they do keep a lot of download cards which is another option and I mean to be honest like I was always kind of against non-physical stuff originally but I was very okay with it on PC and I mean to the most part I am still okay with that because I have a huge Steam library unfortunately just still growing by the day and
1587721	1589802	I'm just never going to play all those games.
1589862	1590683	But you know what?
1590723	1592965	It's fine because maybe I will someday.
1592985	1594046	You never know.
1594526	1595647	And it doesn't matter.
1595828	1600191	Either way, that person, that developer got paid because I thought their game was cool enough to purchase.
1601012	1604675	Whether I play it or not, yeah, I mean, that kind of sucks, but that's beyond the point.
1606670	1621521	but yeah, it's I trust those indie game developers a hundred times more than I would trust Cartoon Network or Warner Brothers games, like please like I would never trust that if I had the choice between spending $20 on an indie game or $20 on a Warner Brothers game
1623923	1631249	I'm going to buy the indie game because I know that at least that's going to work for as long as that person is physically able to support that game.
1631450	1632150	Whereas Warner Bros.
1632190	1634172	is like, oh, well, let's just get rid of it.
1634192	1635673	We'll write it off as a tax thing.
1636134	1636834	Like, I'm sorry.
1636854	1638356	This is just the...
1640087	1645312	This is essentially what a lot of this private equity stuff happens.
1645532	1653560	Like, any time you hear about a company that's just being, like, stripped of everything, Toys R Us, and just shut down because of private equities...
1657759	1659280	Party City, yeah, Private Equity.
1659320	1669446	They buy it up, strip it out, like they're selling off organs on the black market, and then they sell it off and close it down, and everybody loses their jobs and stuff like that.
1669486	1673188	And granted, Party City wasn't super popular.
1673248	1673529	I mean...
1675169	1699420	it was, it served its purpose it was the only option for like costumes year round because spirit stores aren't exactly open year round although I guess now spirit is testing a thing where it changes from Halloween to Christmas at some point and it's like they're doing like a spirit or maybe just holiday or whatever they call it like they're doing like a holiday type of store now
1701880	1702600	Interesting.
1702741	1703921	Or just sell it online.
1703941	1705182	Sell costumes online.
1705242	1706583	Why not sell those all the year?
1706603	1711505	The only other option now is Amazon.
1711845	1718529	I just hate seeing everything in the world folding into Amazon.
1718709	1719910	It's getting kind of scary.
1720450	1722491	It's kind of been scary for a little bit, but it's getting worse.
1722851	1726632	And like to see Party, yeah, Party City was some niche shit, okay?
1726992	1730533	But it was that kind of niche shit when it's like when you need it, you need it, right?
1731154	1733995	And we always had, and Jamie, you'll remember this.
1734115	1737336	We always had that place that was superior to Party City for a long time.
1737356	1738156	Do you remember Wishing Well?
1739025	1760665	yes yeah yeah that store was the fucking bomb but then that was the first to go was the independent party stores were the first to go and then Party City still kind of hung on because it was very corporate and then um now they're gone too and I feel like all right well if you're preparing for a party and you have a need for you know green party hats or something like you know like like it
1760965	1789202	Ingress stuff is always green versus blue it's very easy to find a lot of blue party shit and a lot of green party shit at Party City all the time but now it's like they did and it actually works out really well so much cosplay stuff there too so it's a bummer I'm not happy to see it but it's like one of those things like sure I can buy all that same shit on Amazon but I just don't love that it's like yet another Amazon thing
1791462	1794243	It's like the entire world is being sold through Amazon.
1794303	1795743	It's a little crazy.
1796223	1800124	Exactly, because Amazon's there to get... I mean, it's like Walmart or Target.
1800224	1801564	I mean, more so Walmart, I think.
1801964	1803204	But, like, you know, they come in.
1803384	1803905	They're huge.
1804125	1806745	They put all the independents out of business, and they raise their prices.
1807285	1808125	Same with Amazon.
1808185	1815247	Amazon, in the sense, they're going to keep selling, like, cheap knockoff Chinese crap, but they're also going to...
1816047	1816748	and DarkSakura.com.
1841018	1842759	This is the stuff that Bezos does.
1843500	1850265	I was reminded though on the party front and the costume front that at least here locally where we're based in Sacramento, we do still have Evangeline's.
1850705	1853767	And I had forgotten that they do run the costume mansion year round now.
1853787	1854408	They didn't always.
1854428	1855789	It used to be only during the Halloween season.
1855849	1856949	I love Evangeline's.
1857230	1858531	Yeah, I love Evangeline's too.
1859371	1867397	If you ever visit Sacramento in Old Town, Evangeline's is absolutely one of the top three very Sacramento things I would urge you to visit.
1867417	1868978	I think Evangeline's is fucking rad.
1869539	1869639	Um...
1870299	1883517	but I mean Evangelion is really good for costumes they don't have quite the same amount of party supplies I mean they have some but you know but um yeah at least they have that locally which is nice but not every town's gonna have something like that this is a bummer
1885149	1888712	I want to address something else you said, though, Loki, since it is a slower news week.
1888732	1890233	We have room for more tangents tonight.
1890693	1895798	I wanted to bring up, you mentioned at Target you see that the trading card stuff is kind of exploding.
1896378	1900862	You know what I think is the smartest fucking game that was released all year?
1901243	1902083	I'm not saying the best.
1902444	1905126	I'm saying the smartest game they released all year.
1906107	1909570	That Pokemon trading card pocket game.
1910831	1911471	Brilliant.
1912292	1918395	Whoever thought of that game, that is like the million dollar idea because you know what that game is?
1918896	1930122	They really put the focus, instead of like trying to recreate the Pokemon trading card experience one for one, they put all of the focus on collecting cards, showing them off.
1930482	1939408	And yeah, we have a scaled down version of the game over here too, so it's notably different from the trading card game, but kind of gets you your first taste of it.
1940388	1956923	and I can't tell you how many people I've seen on social media that have dug up their old Pokemon cards or went to the store and bought Pokemon cards for old time's sake or suddenly have a renewed interest in the Pokemon physical trading card game because of what they've done with the mobile game.
1958665	1959646	It's wild.
1959686	1962989	And yeah, I will fully admit, I play the mobile game.
1963069	1966372	I have not bought the physical cards before
1967645	1970486	But I'm not saying I would never, ever buy the physical cards.
1970546	1972506	Some of them are really cute, cool looking.
1973527	1977428	So, you know, I just think that's like the smartest thing that they've done.
1978328	1983450	S2HunterMatt in chat says, Rob talks about this just as I pull up my game to open my free pack, right?
1984730	1990433	DarkSakura says, I kind of fell off Pokemon trading card game, but then my phone has been acting weird lately, so it just might be me.
1990613	1995736	Well, hopefully your phone... You could always try a reset on your phone or something.
1995756	1995996	I don't know.
1996016	1997177	I don't want to give that kind of advice on air.
1997217	2000358	But anyway, I hope you're able to get it to work again.
2000738	2003280	But I just think that's... Because that game...
2004574	2009839	I have a hard time believing that game was not released without another agenda in mind.
2010160	2014364	And that agenda was bringing awareness to the physical trading card game.
2015287	2016747	and a lot of people love Pokemon.
2017328	2018708	It's an easy thing to get people into.
2020069	2022109	Anyway, I just want to bring that up.
2022930	2025390	Maybe that's why the trading card stuff is expanding, Loki.
2025430	2026471	It's more Pokemon cards.
2026731	2027591	But not that that's the only way.
2028011	2031152	I feel like Magic is as popular as it's ever been.
2031712	2034353	Fucking Magic the Gathering has been around since I was in high school.
2034453	2036114	That was a very long time ago at this point.
2036454	2054561	when I was talking about cards it wasn't necessarily trading cards they do have a huge section over by the cash registers for trading cards but I was talking about like the digital download codes for games but yeah no they do still I thought you were talking about the aisle by the register that has been there for a long it's still there right yeah
2055140	2072770	it's still there, yeah, they have a lot of stuff with all that, the trading card stuff and yeah, with the Pokemon trading card the digital game, at the very least there it's also something you can get into it without having to worry about people snatching up all the cards and stuff in real life, although I don't I think that's probably cooled down a bit, I haven't heard
2074418	2094417	I haven't followed the scene closely enough to and even when I hear about Pokemon from Shane or somebody else I know that's into Pokemon it's usually the trading card game is the one where it's like I love Pokemon but I don't really do the trading card game yet now that this is out it's like well okay now maybe I'm doing it a little bit
2095357	2123237	but even I've I've been playing the pocket game I because I like that the focus is just on kind of the collecting and like any battle I don't do I just don't do the player versus player battles it's very easy to not play them do I miss out on some cosmetic rewards yes do I care no and then as far as the PVE goes you can just let the you just hit auto battle and I let my little phone just sit here while auto battles while I'm doing something else and check it oh did I win did I lose okay go again or whatever I want to do it's great
2124281	2128245	Yeah, so I just, I think they really, whoever put that together, very, very smart idea.
2130467	2137914	Mike Deft in chat says, granted, the Pokemon card boom went off during pandemic times, but TCG Pocket definitely reignited it.
2138214	2144760	I mean, yeah, it's weird to think about, but the pandemic being new was five years ago.
2145321	2145401	Yeah.
2147122	2150465	It's been a while since the days of Animal Crossing and all of that.
2151646	2159273	Def says, that's cooled off, but that's also because Pokemon Company has done better in fulfilling stock and even making cards more readily available.
2159373	2162436	Oh yeah, that was that whole stuff about the museum card and all that stuff, right?
2163676	2191003	SGO100Matt says Pokemon trading card game YouTube channels do very well people have been pulling high view counts just making videos opening card packs I'm talking the actual card game not the pocket game shit you could probably make videos for the pocket game too and it would do a respectful number so yeah that doesn't surprise me at all that whole like blind pack opening thing no matter what game you're playing I feel like is always big numbers on YouTube
2192919	2193860	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2211766	2218970	Well, first of all, I have to thank my co-hosts on this series for my gifts.
2219750	2224292	Thank you, Loki, for Bomb Rush Cyberpunk.
2224312	2225153	I always say the name wrong.
2226433	2227834	Which is available on GeForce.
2227854	2228314	I can play it.
2230095	2237179	Rob, thank you for Digimon World and Rocky Horror Show and the ghost one that I never remember the name of either.
2237759	2238260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2256120	2258881	Yeah, I do have a bunch of PC games on there, but I find ways to play them.
2260042	2262564	I can't imagine the Rocky Horror Games a very heavy-duty game.
2262604	2265185	It ought to be able to run on one of those.
2266046	2269168	Well, Whiskey could run Project T with no problem.
2269228	2270268	Yeah, yeah.
2270308	2270729	It was in beta, so...
2273266	2278870	It'll load dead by daylight, but the stupid anti-cheat blocks it, so whatever it is.
2280992	2285976	But I beat Dragon Age The Veil Guard, and I'm on my second playthrough.
2288838	2298265	This playthrough is me doing most of the opposite decisions that I did from the last one, except for a few things, because there's morality things that I wouldn't vote differently.
2299606	2299686	Um...
2301606	2312667	and uh I played some Dead by Daylight working on finishing out um the all the challenges that there are to do I'm gonna play a little bit tonight since I don't have work tomorrow um
2315177	2318820	I've been playing Fruit Mountain, which I'm kind of addicted to.
2319541	2328529	It's like a 3D version of the Suica game, where you rotate this platter around and have to stack and merge fruit and stuff.
2328589	2331111	It's sort of like my mindless game, you know, my clicker.
2332312	2334314	Requires a little bit of thought, but not a lot of thought.
2335315	2335375	Um...
2337540	2358182	that's that's really really been it um we're doing a lot of downsizing in the house and um well if anyone's got a couple grand to have a couple of Final Fight games I could sell you well Mighty Final Fight and uh Final Fight Guy yeah those games are quite rare quite rare
2359264	2360064	Yes, they are.
2361545	2366528	But we've gone through and just tried to compile some things like the Atari games were kind of all over the place.
2367589	2368389	But I got a gift.
2368709	2377374	Okay, so I'm going to take a bit of a tangent aside on this one and bear with me because this is me gamifying something.
2378815	2385659	So I am in the middle of creating myself a leveling up system to level up my ballet practice.
2387448	2407855	and I'm gonna be setting like experience points for myself for doing like my stretches or for making levels and like every time I hit like a certain milestone that's gonna be you know a level with the final mastery goal is being given permission to practice on point
2409452	2414433	So, I'm setting up my Instagram to record all of this.
2415833	2416753	Sakura does dance.
2417413	2423875	And I think that it's the same thing that Nerd Fitness does.
2423895	2428916	They make a game out of your fitness goals and stuff.
2429016	2436577	And I was just thinking that I'm also going to see about trying to play games while I'm on my balance ball.
2438884	2442307	I have a Bosu ball now, like the half-tone ones you stand on.
2443488	2448893	And so I'm going to be setting up fitness-related video game challenges for myself too.
2449493	2454457	So like, play so-and-such while doing like 10 plies or something.
2456819	2458201	Look for that on its way.
2458441	2462064	I'm going to be mixing the things that I love in a very weird way.
2462421	2465984	I think gamification is so good for doing a lot of those tasks.
2466024	2470308	You know, you've heard me talk about how important Pikmin Bloom was for some of the things I was trying to accomplish.
2470768	2472610	I know there are some like apps.
2473751	2475492	I don't know if this is of any interest to you.
2475552	2477374	You might just have your own system and that's great.
2477714	2481417	But I know there's been some apps I've seen out there and I was trying to Google real quick what they were called.
2481738	2485241	And there was one coming up called Life RPG, but it keeps reading up the Google store.
2485321	2487142	And I know I saw one on iPhone.
2487162	2488884	So I don't know if it's just on both and I'm not getting it.
2489304	2515743	but like where you would set your own tasks in a XP and gold rewards another one's coming up called Habitica or something is another one that's coming up I don't I've never heard of that one so again I don't want to endorse these because I don't know them but there I've definitely seen that there was one that I had at one point I thought it was life RPG or something like that that like you set up your own tasks in it and it's so it sort of builds the graphics and the engine and sort of builds the game around whatever tasks it is you want to do
2516563	2518765	I'm looking at the live RPG one.
2518805	2519905	It looks very fascinating.
2521306	2527671	Something like that is actually kind of what I'm thinking of.
2528071	2531153	If I can make a full game out of it, then let's absolutely do it.
2531393	2532534	Great.
2536036	2536817	Loki, we'll go to you then.
2538584	2547473	Well, this week I worked more on my big ride, so I've built up Raccoon Town.
2547853	2553099	It's like a shanty town that's inside of a giant mountain cave with raccoons in it.
2553159	2560607	I kept calling it, originally I was calling it Raccoon City and people kept getting confused with Resident Evil, so I had to change it to Raccoon Town, which is fine.
2561437	2562679	But yeah, that's all done now.
2564061	2568006	Decorate the external part of the front of the roller coaster area.
2568166	2573193	And I'm doing the queue area right now, working on that.
2573574	2577539	And then I just need to hook up all the redstone and do some custom models in.
2579333	2585157	It's just taking a very long time, but there's going to be a lot of stuff done all at once.
2585237	2593882	Because I've got some other... One of our supporting cast came back to finish up one of the areas that they said they were going to work on.
2594362	2598124	And then another one expressed interest in making another ride on another side of the park.
2598685	2602807	And then my other cast member, Arrington, is finishing.
2602827	2603888	I think he finished his...
2605234	2607516	Game that's also in the parks.
2607736	2612240	Parks can become three times as big all of a sudden.
2613201	2615363	It's been a lot of work, but it looks really cool.
2615563	2616464	The vibes are there.
2617845	2620307	Aside from that, Bellaltro is still playing that.
2620467	2628895	I don't know why, but I haven't played much of the mobile version, but all of a sudden today I had a run where I'm getting three legendary jokers, which...
2629335	2641979	I don't know why I haven't gotten that in any other run yet so that's kind of interesting what necessarily triggers that but cool neat to see those yeah just been enjoying that a lot cool
2642964	2644385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2663004	2665886	which is certified Steam Deck Fresh or whatever.
2666906	2669228	And I played Pixel Poops also.
2669548	2670808	Now, Loki, I don't know if you know this.
2670908	2674911	I tried to play Pixel Poops number two, but I was having a hard time getting past the title screen.
2675111	2677612	I don't know if there's something weird about the deck controls or something.
2677992	2683736	I don't even know if it's something you care about at this point, but I'll have to show you or something because I wasn't able to get it to work.
2684016	2687778	And it could just be that I'm a noob, but I couldn't get it to work on the deck.
2688218	2704899	so because that was the one I was trying to play and then I just I was like all right I'll just play regular pixel poops that's fine maybe it's the emulator or something like that I think it is bubbled in there I think it is so it probably I probably need to reconfigure the controls somehow and I just couldn't figure it out but I was surprised the emulator wasn't like steam deck ready or whatever so
2705828	2707289	Um, probably not.
2707409	2708210	Yeah, it makes sense.
2708250	2709991	You may have to just remap it somehow.
2710211	2714455	Yeah, I have to look into what its controls and remap it probably is ultimately what I have to do.
2715015	2719299	But yeah, so but I think I even popped a new achievement on super multitasking.
2719419	2725084	So like when you go to my profile, you'll see I got like achievements like five years ago when it first came out and then I got a new one this week.
2725184	2725905	So there you go.
2726005	2726946	Shout out for YYR.
2727786	2729488	I still think super multitasking is
2730968	2746476	it's it's it's not getting the flowers it deserves in the gaming community it's a brilliant game and I really encourage you all to check it out super multitasking um yeah I played World of Warcraft I hit level 80 on which is the new level cap right now uh on my character and uh yeah yay me um
2747136	2748677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2771718	2772279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2789435	2790216	Super Mario Bros.
2790236	2790636	2 Challenge
2804631	2826584	I swear to god we played that one snippet of Mario 2 for like a fucking hour trying to get an S rank and we did it by the way we did it so enough perseverance will get you there so Nintendo World Championships as well um shout out for emulators because I was like I I have decided that because I'm looking at like what do I want my goal to be next year and I've decided I want to beat
2828392	2830173	35, and I'll tell you where I got that number from in a minute.
2830533	2839979	I want to beat 35 retro games and I'm using quote on stream, but on stream might be YouTube recordings because sometimes I play games late at night.
2840540	2845023	So, and I, the one thing I just, I'm not going to be able to do is set a regular schedule.
2845083	2849686	Like I can't do what Jamie does where it's like every Monday, like things in my schedule are too erratic.
2850126	2852968	So I'll kind of try to stream those things as I can, but
2853348	2854789	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2867037	2868298	I was like, that's one game a week.
2868338	2870559	And then I thought, you know what, that might be too many.
2870579	2872840	Because some games I want to play are like Final Fantasy 3.
2872980	2876662	Because I am going to go by Super Nintendo names and, you know, kind of the original.
2876902	2878122	So I want to play Final Fantasy 3.
2878182	2880964	And some games are going to... And I might even play Chrono Trigger.
2881144	2881504	I might.
2882064	2882384	I might.
2883145	2885086	You know, some games are going to take me longer than others.
2885426	2886967	So I didn't want to do like one game a week.
2887267	2888327	And then I was like, well, maybe I'll do 25.
2889808	2891809	And then I was like, well, 25 doesn't seem like enough.
2892249	2893430	So 35's in the middle.
2893610	2893690	Yeah.
2894150	2902332	where it gives me a little room to do some long RPGs and then I can do some platformers to sort of fill in the gaps that I can beat a lot quicker.
2902812	2906273	So that's my goal for next year, so stay tuned.
2907074	2913876	But when I was playing retros, I decided to fire up a game I used to play a lot of, which was Bust a Groove 2.
2914696	2917937	Sorry, Jamie, I know you're going to cringe because I said Bust a Groove and not Bust a Move, but...
2918757	2921958	The plan is to ultimately beat both because there's achievements for both.
2922319	2923439	So I just went with the one I knew.
2923899	2927381	But I have to say, so Buster Groove 2 is pretty easy to get running in the emulator.
2927761	2938666	Buster Groove, the original, like the timing window is way too tight in the core I was using.
2938726	2945329	So I think I either need to use like a standalone emulator or I'm using the wrong core because I think I switched the core to...
2946528	2971258	one of the other ones and it worked a lot better but I still felt the timing would at least I was able to get past like a stage but I had such a hard time getting through uh the game uh but whereas Buster Groove 2 like it just it's like memory it just comes back and I was able to get all the way through Robo Z Gold in one sitting very easy so I was like all right I can do this so anyway that was fun um
2972563	2973625	Pagelin Rogue-like Pagel
2983712	2990616	so you are fighting monsters in a dungeon but the whole battle mechanic runs off of Peggle basically or Plinko.
2990636	2991556	Which game was that again?
2991736	3010146	Peglin, P-E-G-L-I-N and so yeah and the different pegs like you get like at the end of levels it's like this peg is going to make things worth double or the orange peg will split the ball into two and do these things so it's like you're buying different peg power-ups which
3011807	3014049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3032387	3034910	DungeonCrawler DungeonClawler
3050367	3051207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3075905	3100641	and then another random game I started playing thanks to Steam Deck this was actually bought for me by a listener a few months ago so thank you very much and I apologize it took me this long to really get into the game but I saw it came out of early access and now that I have the Steam Deck I was like oh I should go revisit this and it's a game called Dwarven Realms the best way I could describe this game is it's Diablo mixed with vampire survivors
3102006	3127461	so it kind of like has that Diablo look and feel to it in the interface but then like when you're actually going in the levels you kind of are doing like this auto sword swiping thing and you're kind of doing the funky dances around the enemies to kind of get them and then you get the power-ups where it's like oh it creates a lightning pull as you move or dragons come in and breathe fire you know these type of things which is very much like what Vampire Survivors kind of does so I was like oh this is really addicting
3127921	3146939	and so even though it wasn't certified for Steam Deck because I guess it has small text and so it's not certified for Steam Deck it plays very well on Steam Deck so I was playing quite a bit of that game and so yeah that was a fun one to visit as well so I've been very busy this week playing games I didn't just play Final Fantasy XIV please clap
3149751	3170269	yes and now I have more now I have more games to play I still want to play more Hades 2 which you know DarkSakura picked up the the full early access version for me and this uh this Zelda game or not Zelda game excuse me not Zelda game that Loki bought me looks very cool so I want to check that out as well especially if Loki builds any levels for it oh yeah I'll look at that I'm sure they're ridiculous
3171141	3194685	all right um oh I love that in chat uh Fifth Dream says Dungeon Claw is great as Joe and Hunter Matt says adding these to my wish list someone owes Rob money shit we need like an epic game store code or something I oh well anyway but I did get these on Steam just don't go through honey check out oh god did did you see the video I posted about that no I didn't hear about this what happened
3195666	3202990	So, Honey, basically, a lot of the people who have been peddling it like influencers are actually losing money.
3203070	3204071	Oh, I did see the video.
3204111	3206472	I just didn't, I was distracted and didn't actually watch it.
3206893	3207293	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3207433	3214037	But, yeah, well, the thing is, is that it's replacing their referral codes with their own no matter what.
3214657	3215157	and DarkSakura.com
3242911	3266521	and yeah I posted the video on my blue sky a few days ago and this person really goes into detail about it and it's pretty pretty insidious so um I I have never I I looked at it once and never installed it thank god because I knew it felt like a scam and I'm gratified to know that I was right so um
3267751	3268932	Yeah, don't use it.
3269132	3269773	Uninstall it.
3270974	3272655	Don't just disable it.
3272815	3273476	Uninstall it.
3275037	3287547	And it's so funny, if you go in and you view your page source, like if you've got a developer mode, you can actually see it actively change the referral address.
3290402	3291223	It's pretty nasty.
3292744	3299872	So yeah, just look for discounts yourself, put a little bit of extra work into it, and don't put any more money in their pocket.
3300312	3304577	I just re-blooped it on the Orange Lounge Radio Blue Sky over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3304597	3306259	I went and dug up your post and re-blooped it.
3306459	3308702	So I get re-skieded.
3308842	3309883	Sorry, I think that's really good.
3310239	3311680	I'm not ever using that term.
3311700	3313060	I am not 12, okay?
3313160	3316902	Like, some adult jokes are funny.
3316962	3318003	That one is just lazy.
3318143	3320284	So I reposted it or whatever you want to call it.
3320304	3323065	We need a... I liked... Somebody called it bleat.
3323665	3324426	I like bleat.
3324606	3325626	Why can't we call them bleats?
3325666	3330929	And then it makes me think of Dead by Daylight because we always called the blight the bleat or the blort.
3331509	3332930	So I just like bleat.
3333530	3334190	So re-bleat.
3334270	3337092	I re-bleated on the orangewatchradio.com blues guy.
3338769	3342050	Well, I decided to go with, by the way, with Habitica.
3343210	3344510	Oh, there you go, DarkSakura.
3344630	3345150	Orange, right?
3345250	3347431	Just uninstalled it myself long overdue.
3347751	3348151	Good for you.
3348611	3349011	You got one.
3351472	3351712	Yeah.
3351872	3360894	This is... So I've put it on myself to do 15 minutes of bar and 10 minutes of cleaning up crap.
3362259	3371103	And then, like, I'm putting some stuff on here that... It's also got this cute little pixel girl and everything, so... I think I'm into this one.
3371123	3372164	Wait, is this the live RPG?
3373405	3375406	No, live RPG ended up being something different.
3375586	3376646	Oh.
3377046	3378367	I'm using the Habitica.
3378747	3379387	Okay, Habitica.
3379548	3379748	Okay.
3380868	3381188	Nice!
3381208	3382089	Yeah, let me make sure...
3382682	3384723	Yeah, Gamified Task Manager.
3385424	3391967	If that works out well for you, I want to check back in with you next week and see how you liked it because I might want to use it too.
3393568	3393828	Okay.
3394409	3396430	I'm going to wait for the DarkSakura endorsement.
3396470	3397810	Washing the dishes on here?
3397991	3398571	No, thank you.
3400872	3405155	It's giving me dailies to do and I'm going to be doing different dailies.
3405415	3405795	That's fair.
3407301	3409502	Alright, we got through everybody's gaming week.
3409523	3411624	Sorry, mine was long, but hey, I played a lot of games.
3411664	3412605	Yay, good job me.
3412885	3415547	Alright, let's go to some headlines.
3415567	3416607	We do have some headlines this week.
3416627	3417688	There's a few things in the news.
3418128	3423272	Maybe these aren't very meaty stories we might get into in other weeks, but we will take what we can get.
3423312	3424192	There's a few things here.
3424312	3431337	Again, a lot of these things this week, homemade, mod community, fan community type affair.
3431357	3433519	Everyone's taking the time off right now.
3433559	3435680	Everyone's working overtime, but this is great.
3435720	3436981	We get things like this, Loki, right?
3438062	3438102	Um...
3465882	3467343	That's pretty awesome looking.
3467463	3474206	They have a video demonstrating it on an ultra-wide monitor running Star Fox 64's intro, which is pretty cool.
3476767	3477007	Neat.
3477207	3484770	I mean, I'd be curious about multiplayer support because I used to love playing the dogfights that they used to have in that game.
3485231	3485851	That was a lot of fun.
3486786	3488027	Yeah, I definitely want to check this out.
3488067	3489148	This sounds really cool.
3489528	3498476	So yeah, I think it's so cool to take such an older game and really open it up for a modern sort of setup.
3498536	3499197	I think that's so cool.
3500367	3501127	Yeah, it's nice.
3501187	3506950	It's also good for like preservation as well, because then you can still be able to play it on like modern hardware and everything.
3507110	3510551	Yeah, there's a... It's probably also great for the Steam Deck.
3511972	3512712	Honestly, yeah.
3512832	3517634	I mean, you have to have, you know, because they obviously are not going to distribute the Star Fox 64 ROM.
3517654	3523377	And I think as sort of a Nintendo legal team protection system,
3523757	3526578	They make it very clear in their website and a lot of documentation.
3526618	3528239	You need to have your own copy of the game.
3528339	3530240	This will not work without your own copy of the game.
3530600	3532281	And they don't really get into reasons why.
3532381	3534742	I mean, because all you really need is the ROM, right?
3534802	3537403	Yeah, the ROM does the conversion.
3537723	3540744	For legal reasons, they are wording it the way they're wording it.
3542145	3542825	Yeah.
3543726	3544106	Interesting.
3545635	3552339	OrangeRite in chat points out, my first 120 star run in Mario 64 was on one of the unofficial ports on the Vita.
3553139	3554640	S2100Matt sends a YouTube.
3554720	3555480	This looks pretty cool.
3555540	3557441	It's a side-by-side comparison.
3557782	3558462	Oh, holy crap.
3558482	3559242	I hadn't really seen this.
3559302	3564225	I'll bring this up for those that are watching live tonight over at VOG Network.
3564645	3590845	but for those that are listening on the podcast feed you can definitely see it like what the thing that jumps out to me is the frame rate yeah the frame rate on this PC version is impressive I mean yes it's got the widescreen you know element to it which is you know also impressive that you kind of see more of the level than you would on the Nintendo 64 version but like this yeah just the frame rate alone it just that's what I'm saying like that so that's what's so frustrating about this it's like
3591875	3594437	Nintendo could do this.
3595698	3598739	You literally probably could just use their executable that they've already created.
3598759	3605584	You could do this yourself and put it on the Switch and call it the enhanced version or something like that and people would be eating this crap up.
3605824	3608846	You could just do that with your whole Nintendo 64 library or whatever.
3608926	3612908	This is where their legal team kind of shoots themselves in the foot because, and I...
3614009	3618932	I understand why companies do this, but it's also very frustrating because this exists.
3619492	3625576	Somebody on the Nintendo legal team is going to say we cannot release this because it already exists out there.
3625996	3633320	And there's a liability for Nintendo that this organization says you took our files and sues us for what we did.
3634670	3636833	That hasn't stopped them in the past.
3636853	3638975	They've used emulators from third parties as well.
3639035	3640577	I know, and don't get me wrong.
3642159	3643600	You and I are actually on the same page.
3643700	3647625	I'm just saying, this is what the discussion is that happens in Nintendo's legal camp.
3648045	3654172	Why it's so frustrating that when you see these fans innovating in ways that Nintendo ought to be innovating, it's why Nintendo doesn't do it.
3655191	3658214	is because then the legal team goes, yeah.
3658274	3661358	QuestBuster in chat says, Bloodborne has entered the chat.
3661538	3663800	Oh, yeah, that Bloodborne cart thing, right?
3664061	3668085	Well, they ended up releasing that, but as they called it something else.
3668726	3671188	I mean, but that one, see, that's the perfect example.
3671208	3673591	So like Nintendo, what they would probably do is say...
3673831	3674852	God, this looks so good.
3692691	3695254	Yeah, why can't they just make this StarKitty64?
3695595	3696977	Change the fox into a kitty.
3697918	3700822	Sorry to all the StarFox fans and palco, just make it StarKitty.
3701543	3702204	No, you say that.
3702264	3707832	I actually have a game that is very much like StarFox that's basically kind of like...
3709319	3731548	I don't even remember what it's called now President Cat in Space yes Space Cat Star Fox would be President Cat in Space absolutely yeah I don't remember what it's called now let's see I'm trying to remember what it's called uh
3735814	3737415	I don't know, I'll figure it out and I'll let you know.
3737455	3740136	But like, yeah, there's an indie game that's like Star Fox.
3741236	3744498	Oh, it's X Zodiac.
3745958	3749520	So EX Zodiac is, it's essentially Star Fox.
3750260	3752401	Deft beats you to it in chat, so gold star for Deft.
3752421	3757023	Yeah, I backed that on Kickstarter a long time ago and I have it in my library as well.
3757483	3758364	But it looks awesome.
3761161	3762402	Let's see other comments and chats.
3762703	3767209	Def says, there's one in development right now more akin to Star Fox 64, but I forget the name.
3767389	3770033	DarkTutsia says, do we need to update the Dream Games folder?
3770113	3770513	Maybe.
3770854	3772816	I think we have a bleat on that later.
3772976	3774238	So hold that thought.
3774358	3774659	All right.
3775019	3775320	Anyway.
3775940	3791583	for now let's move on to our next story which has to do with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle one of those games I've kind of missed amongst all the holiday stuff that's been going on and I sort of regret it because apparently this game is apparently really good I think Tara was playing it but I haven't seen what they thought of it
3792573	3800319	Well, mostly it's been getting, I don't know what they thought specifically, but mostly, most critics are really favorable on this.
3800339	3811507	And I think I mentioned last week, many critics are saying it's pretty much a better Indiana Jones experience than the last two movies, which is a pretty good compliment there that gaming's getting it right when Hollywood is not.
3812508	3816451	And if rumors are to be believed, this is a rumor, but it's, you ready?
3817212	3820974	Just for the holidays, I find this rumor to be plausible.
3821874	3833340	because it's coming from a Windows Central journalist and leaker named Jez Corden who said that they've heard that Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones.
3833720	3836582	And this was on an episode of the Xbox Two podcast.
3836602	3837422	That's kind of a funny name.
3838443	3840164	Not long after the launch of the game.
3840464	3847928	We don't know exactly how many copies of the game this has moved, but it does believe like through other types of tracking that
3848288	3859751	It seems like this game was the second best-selling full release in North America, its week of release, trailing just Call of Duty Black Ops 6, which to be fair at this point is another Microsoft game.
3860111	3866453	So for Microsoft to be holding the first two spots with different genres of games is a pretty fucking good place to be for them.
3866833	3867853	So I'm sure they're happy.
3868333	3869814	And, you know, again, if the...
3870734	3873156	Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney Disney
3889207	3890929	Money, money, money for the likeness and all that.
3891269	3894513	But it's Troy Baker that does the voice in the game.
3894673	3901822	And Harrison Ford has given props to the game and Troy Baker's great performance as Indiana Jones.
3902162	3903503	So that's quite the endorsement there.
3903604	3908910	So like, Indiana Jones has a future in video games that I'm not sure it has in movies.
3909330	3909731	And that's...
3911212	3914196	I just... It's just such an interesting thing to be saying.
3914417	3921647	I mean, is that, you know, especially for all the talk all these years of really bad movie ports into games, I think we all know that...
3922600	3929986	Video games as an art form are fully capable of experiences sometimes even beyond those what movies can provide.
3931907	3933188	Like the Final Fantasy series.
3933869	3937431	I'm sure somebody would love to turn some of those Final Fantasy games into a movie.
3937651	3938652	Is it going to hit the same way?
3938772	3939213	I doubt it.
3940253	3941094	It'll happen someday.
3941174	3943096	Somebody's going to turn Final Fantasy VII into a movie someday.
3944797	3947799	Besides Avenger, I mean literally the plot of VII.
3948379	3949500	You mean Spirits Within?
3949520	3949580	Yes.
3949801	3950081	Yes.
3951291	3952371	That was different though.
3952392	3954753	The reason why Spirits Within didn't work is because it wasn't a game.
3955753	3958314	Spirits Within should have been a game, not a movie.
3958914	3965658	I mean, technically there was the anime for 5, but yeah, that one was alright.
3965818	3966018	Yeah.
3966798	3981550	so yeah I think so Questmaster says Great Circle is amazing probably my favorite one right now Tiger Claw says they can make a lot of these games if they stick to the era between the 30s and 40s they can tell all kinds of stories just pick a year look
3982588	3982628	So...
4011294	4030212	SS2100 Matt says Troy Baker is going to get a pay bump next game that's for sure who else can they find that's officially endorsed by Harrison Ford it is how do I say this without sounding mean I'm very happy for Troy Baker and I think it's great that he's doing such a good job I do find it
4032042	4033423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4059574	4059935	Who else?
4060355	4062758	Okay, Indiana Jones is spoken for.
4062778	4073432	But, you know, if other Hollywood studios start to look to how do we make an Indiana Jones and the Great Circle out of our dead movie franchise, which will happen.
4074674	4075255	It will happen.
4076849	4077189	Yeah, yeah.
4103877	4123706	I think they are and I think they are like it's on the table that a mummy that a mummy another mummy reboot is coming but like that that's actually pop culture that's a great call out like the universal villain like that would actually make for a great gaming series I think if they could just find the right partner and the right creative version with a vision with that
4124266	4144762	but um with Nosferatu being successful like Nosferatu did pretty well at the box office this weekend if I'm not mistaken I've heard a lot of people speaking pretty good on that movie so I'm assuming with that doing well um there there may still be talk about classic horror icons coming to the screen still um so we'll see um
4145836	4156485	But also, it's been very interesting to watch the Sonic... Because the media, the Hollywood media is framing it all as a Sonic versus the Lion King debate.
4157205	4160308	And I guess some days, Sonic is winning.
4160828	4162510	Some days, the Lion King is winning.
4162790	4164231	They're kind of running neck and neck.
4164291	4167994	But as we know, last weekend, Sonic ended up being better at the box.
4168054	4172438	And apparently, the third Sonic movie, critically, is the best one.
4173038	4174340	And it's like...
4175280	4175761	What's happening?
4176041	4176922	Isn't this weird?
4177382	4180264	And just like, why does it matter?
4180424	4184667	I mean, maybe from a financial standpoint, but just let people like what they like and not make a contest out of it.
4184768	4185828	No, for sure, for sure.
4185908	4189551	But it's, you know, industry, money, investing, all that garbage, blah, blah, blah.
4190032	4204603	But now that I'm sitting here saying this part out loud, I'm realizing here I am talking about Hollywood franchises finding success in video games and now video games finding huge success in Hollywood.
4209590	4210791	2025 hasn't even started yet.
4213853	4214413	It's wild.
4217595	4219796	SG100 Matt in chat says, I think we can all agree.
4220157	4226501	If there are always up and coming voice actors, then they can always find someone for a role and never a reason to go with AI voices.
4226521	4226501	100%.
4226661	4227501	110%.
4226681	4227501	Never AI voices.
4227721	4227882	Never.
4227962	4228182	Unless...
4234997	4245501	Your very niche, very niche circumstance where the actor of an iconic role has given express permission for it to happen, such as James Earl Jones and Vader.
4245981	4248682	Even though I'm going to say I still kind of don't like the idea.
4248842	4249402	I really don't.
4250043	4251523	I just think you find somebody new to do it.
4251603	4256205	But if that's James Earl Jones's wishes, he created the character.
4257906	4260567	Essentially, he created the iconic of the character.
4262147	4263068	I guess that is his wish.
4263548	4263668	So.
4265819	4270582	Yes, S200 Matt says, Sonic has had quite the redemption arc since the creepy Sonic.
4270983	4274105	Yeah, and Tiger Class says this is what happens when the studios listen to the fans.
4274285	4274846	Absolutely.
4274906	4278088	And yep, Sonic 4 is scheduled to release spring 2027.
4278428	4281370	The fact a Sonic 4 movie is coming.
4281590	4283392	Least surprising news of the year.
4285014	4285895	Of course it's coming.
4286035	4290461	When you're talking about Sonic competing with a Lion King movie, of course the Sonic 4 is coming.
4290481	4292985	I mean, yes, I know there's plenty of... They already said there is.
4293025	4295848	There's teases and shit, of course, but of course the Sonic 4 is coming.
4295909	4296890	Well, they already said it is.
4297010	4297771	They already greenlit.
4297911	4298252	Yeah.
4298853	4299293	There's that.
4300054	4302798	You know what else they apparently fucking greenlit, which we don't fucking need?
4304013	4307176	An American Version of Squid Game by David Fincher.
4307676	4307976	Why?
4308377	4309578	Fucking A. Why?
4310158	4314402	You don't need to just do Squid Game with American actors.
4314902	4316884	Which is Squid Game now, Netflix.
4316924	4319146	We live in a world that has subtitles.
4319286	4322468	And if you must, if you must, you can do dubs.
4322829	4323429	If you must.
4325831	4327813	But Squid Game already exists.
4327993	4329674	Why do we need an American version of Squid Game?
4329714	4330035	We don't.
4331254	4333876	We have that fucking reality show.
4334656	4335897	The Squid Game, the game.
4336037	4337718	What the fuck was that thing called?
4338178	4342961	Squid Game, but it's real, but it's not because you're not getting shot, but you have paint packs.
4343381	4344001	That whole thing.
4344762	4346223	That's the American version of Squid Game.
4346303	4347583	I can't think of anything.
4347744	4349985	Squid Game or something?
4350045	4352466	I'm just so sick of Squid Game.
4352566	4353207	That's the copy.
4353227	4354547	He's not doing a Squid Game thing.
4354607	4356989	It's more of like a big team effort type of game.
4357049	4357089	So.
4357429	4357809	No, no, no.
4357869	4361651	I know that MrBeast has his own game, but MrBeast also did a Squid Game thing better than Netflix.
4361671	4362311	Oh, he did a YouTube.
4362331	4363191	He did do a YouTube.
4363231	4363691	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4363711	4365372	So, like, he did that as well.
4365592	4377697	It's just, it's like, it's like, I get it that, like, Stranger Things is big, and Squid Game is big, but my god, dude, don't go all in on one thing.
4377797	4380878	Like, your network is not just that one thing.
4380978	4382979	Like, just calm it down.
4383059	4384500	Like, why make a YouTube
4386258	4391579	What purpose could you possibly want an English version of Squid Game?
4391619	4392679	It's just going to lose.
4393179	4394500	It's going to be not good.
4394520	4395620	I don't know.
4395720	4396260	Here's the thing.
4396420	4396720	Whatever.
4396780	4399441	But I'm about to be totally hypocritical, and I don't care.
4399541	4411983	Because whereas I do not support this, what I will continue to support, because somehow I have fallen down this rabbit hole on TikTok, I will support international versions of the Golden Girls so I can hear the international theme songs.
4412003	4412123	Yes.
4412683	4440537	or it's the quote unquote normal theme song being sung in another language which I think was the Finnish Danish version of the show is the same song in a different language but I've fallen down this hole on TikTok where now it shows me like here's the Russian version of the Golden Girls here's the Turkish version of the Golden Girls and I'm like this is fun we should adapt the Golden Girls in every country so that I will support but that's different
4442831	4446793	A sitcom is also kind of a lot different in many ways.
4446934	4455820	I think a sitcom, especially because there's a lot of nuances and humor and things like that, I feel like a sitcom, there's more reasons to port something like that.
4458122	4458442	All right.
4459763	4465167	Anyway, Mike Def says, I'm surprised there's not a Mexican version of the Golden Girls, all things considered.
4465187	4465768	There's not?
4465788	4466188	What?
4466807	4468148	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4468168	4468268	well
4480063	4508031	there is an amazing little game called Night Slashers and there is going to be a soundtrack and physical edition released this is going to be you can get the physical edition with the soundtrack on February 20th, 2025 we have a PS4, PS5 and Switch version for Night Slashers Remake and yeah hopefully folks will like it
4510219	4514020	Hooray for remakes of games that kind of need them.
4515221	4516281	The music is pretty good.
4516321	4519582	I'm listening to just some from the remake and it's actually really good.
4520082	4520622	Yeah, go get it.
4521363	4522343	When it's out, that is.
4523363	4524944	Alright, Loki, we'll go back to you.
4526144	4537648	Alright, so we've got a little bit talking about some... This kind of goes back to that whole thing we were just talking about with Indiana Jones.
4537708	4537848	Like,
4538649	4541811	Company sees money, wants more money.
4542151	4546254	And so now we have PlayStation saying, hey, you know what?
4546954	4551617	Let's take some of those old IPs we have and make more money with them.
4552258	4556160	That's crazy because we saw that Astro Bot, you know, had like
4557583	4581610	things were popular with that with the little different IP references in that game but yeah, our extensive IP portfolio is an important asset of PlayStation and an important thing so that they don't lose the trademark on it probably as well so of course they're going to try to leverage that to make more games off of older IP
4583387	4588071	because, you know, we got to make more Squid Game and we got to make more... No, Intelligent Cube too.
4588111	4588851	Intelligent Cube.
4588871	4588931	Yes.
4594249	4595489	Intelligent Hypercube.
4596729	4597330	You know what?
4597470	4609592	When I think of dormant PlayStation legacy IP that needs to fucking come back, Parappa the Rappa and Unjamalami and their team-up adventure.
4609672	4613932	Although, spoiler alert, Parappa the Rappa's in Unjamalami when you get to a certain point.
4613972	4615473	But I digress.
4615673	4618913	We need the team-up adventure between Parappa the Rappa and Unjamalami.
4619413	4621794	And maybe they have a third friend.
4623294	4629598	that's like country music or R&B or something, like a different genre, like something.
4630298	4630919	Polka.
4630939	4631599	Polka!
4632720	4633100	Yes!
4633120	4637983	You have a klezmer band player.
4638143	4638924	With their clarinet.
4639224	4639544	Yes.
4641105	4642686	And their name is Minuet Clarinet.
4642706	4644267	Oh, there you go.
4644307	4645007	Hey, there you go.
4645027	4645988	It writes itself.
4646148	4650511	Parappa the Rappa, Um Jamma Lammy, and their new friend Tommy the Tuba Player.
4650531	4650631	Yeah.
4652290	4653551	or Trombone.
4653851	4655792	Get the Trombone Hero crossover.
4658114	4660095	The ideas just write themselves, y'all.
4661176	4662036	Ideas write themselves.
4663217	4663497	Alright.
4663698	4665139	I still like Minuet the Clarinet.
4665539	4665799	I do.
4666940	4669782	As a former clarinet player, it has a soft space in my heart.
4670622	4671583	I played clarinet.
4672964	4674585	I played a big clarinet.
4674605	4675966	I know you played the big.
4676126	4677627	I played that for maybe like a month.
4679878	4681943	That's it, we have Contra Alto Clarinet Hero.
4684514	4686115	All right, let's talk about Bellatro.
4686936	4695322	Bellatro, because thanks to a lot of the recent exposure it's been getting between game awards, you know, just kind of the resurgence of the games.
4695622	4698824	And I don't know what the fuck this thing came across my feed.
4698884	4701266	What the fuck is this new commercial with Ben Star in it?
4702067	4705569	Is that like a legit commercial or is that just some type of parody that came up?
4705629	4706030	I don't know.
4706490	4710373	Oh, it's so fucking funny that came up.
4710453	4711814	Wait, is it on YouTube somewhere?
4713925	4714825	I have to show these to folks.
4714845	4720927	I've only seen the one that they did before that about the new card packs, but I don't know the Ben Star one.
4724628	4727409	Oh, it's the Friends of Jimbo pack.
4727929	4729589	Was this something that was during the Game Awards?
4730210	4731910	Yeah, there's a Friends of Jimbo thing.
4731950	4732510	I remember that.
4732710	4733871	Was that Ben Star doing that?
4734091	4734491	Isn't it?
4735471	4735871	I don't know.
4736051	4737051	I'm going to show this again.
4737952	4738992	So we've got the whole...
4743504	4744725	I swear that's Ben Starr.
4745265	4747707	Because it's the whole voice and everything.
4748807	4751309	Oh, I saw that, but I didn't know that it was Ben Starr.
4752090	4753931	If it's not, this is very embarrassing.
4754311	4756572	Okay, SGO100Matt says it is Ben Starr.
4756632	4757053	Thank you.
4757413	4759394	Because I was like, this is going to be very embarrassing if I'm wrong.
4759454	4760715	But I thought it was him for sure.
4761856	4768200	So... Anyway, that just... Oh yeah, okay, so the comments are confirming it's Ben Starr.
4768300	4768460	Phew.
4769817	4773343	I'm glad to see he's getting work.
4773423	4778911	He's going to be in that parthenon of voice actors that are consistently getting work, but good for him.
4778971	4780714	He's so great at what he does.
4781115	4781696	But yeah, the...
4783402	4787085	The commercial with Ben Stars out there for the new expansion, all that stuff.
4787445	4792049	So Bellatro has reached a new concurrent player peak.
4792910	4796913	37,000 was the peak when it was out earlier in the year, but now it's up to 38,000.
4796993	4799535	Also, I'm sure Steam sale helped with that.
4801056	4802037	I'm sure it did too.
4802977	4816927	And then Local Thunk is the game's creator who has celebrated the news on social media saying, Thanks to a crazy December with the Game Awards, two Steam sales, Christmas, and a Markiplier video, we surpassed our all-time concurrent player peak on Steam.
4817327	4819868	The previous peak was around the launch in February.
4820728	4822309	So that's pretty cool.
4822349	4825050	I guess there was a Mark Plyer video and that guy still gets a ton of views.
4825890	4828831	2.5 million views for a game called My New Crippling Addiction.
4829271	4830872	So all of that played into it.
4831132	4833433	And yeah, this game is red hot.
4833773	4837234	That being said, I'm going to have to give it another try.
4837774	4838534	It didn't land with me.
4838555	4839055	It's fun.
4839135	4840095	I love it.
4840395	4841636	I didn't think it was bad.
4842176	4844977	I was just like, I don't know if I get the hype.
4845777	4846998	But I'm going to give it another try.
4847299	4849882	You know what other game didn't land for me the first time?
4850282	4850923	Mass Effect.
4851263	4853846	And then look what fucking happened.
4855127	4856629	Sometimes I just have to try it.
4856669	4863016	And maybe having the Steam Deck, except I have Bellator on PS5, but maybe having the Steam Deck will somehow change my mind.
4864252	4866234	Yeah, I've played it, like, mobile and stuff.
4866254	4867735	I would say, like, it depends.
4867795	4869437	Like, at first, it may not be that exciting.
4869517	4871859	I just do, like, a run or so every so often.
4872099	4872319	Yeah.
4872859	4878504	And sometimes you have, you know, certain runs can be pretty exciting, certain runs are not.
4878945	4885951	But each run you do, you unlock more things to make more runs exciting later on type of stuff.
4885971	4886151	Yeah.
4886947	4889391	Mike Def says we're ready to lose Rob in the following week.
4889491	4891554	Oh, did I say I was going to beat 35 retro games?
4891654	4893977	I meant I was going to play Bellatro for 35 weeks.
4894117	4894979	That's actually what I meant.
4896961	4897222	All right.
4898303	4899465	Moving on, DarkSakura.
4901357	4904799	Well, Sega has put their foot down.
4905320	4911703	Utsumi Ishuji, who is the Sega president, said that they're not going to be doing any more Sega mini consoles.
4912264	4913945	Nope, nope, nope, nope, not happening.
4914585	4917467	In fact, this quote says, I'm not going for the mini direction.
4917587	4918227	It's not me.
4918348	4919808	I want to embrace modern gamers.
4919888	4921109	We are not a retro company.
4921509	4922850	We really appreciate our legacy.
4922910	4923651	We value it.
4923731	4925672	But at the same time, we want to deliver something new.
4925772	4927293	Otherwise, we'll become history.
4927333	4928634	And that's not what we're aiming for.
4932918	4936180	That's what they said Rest R.I.P.
4936240	4961998	and peace The Genesis Mini I did hear They must not like money Well, I heard that at CES They're supposed to have a partnership coming with MyArcade That makes these little The baby cabs you see in the shelving I have a bunch of them Yeah, I know you have some too Apparently Sega is going to do some of those It's just like their dedicated mini Everybody's sitting here going Dreamcast Mini Mini when?
4962358	4963259	No, no, no, no, no.
4963419	4964440	Not Dreamcast Mini.
4964460	4966382	We need more of the candy cabs.
4966422	4967583	Remember how they did those?
4967963	4973308	Because they had the Astro City that had Sega games on it too, like Virtua Fighter and all that stuff.
4973789	4974730	That's what we need more of.
4974970	4980335	We need to get quarter-sized, well, I mean, I don't know what a quarter-sized Astro City cab would look like.
4980355	4981596	It would be even smaller.
4981616	4982457	And you know what?
4982977	4984539	I can just hook up my Saturn.
4985920	5004772	I know Or I have a 32X I have a CDX I can just hook this stuff up The mini arcades are fun I wish they'd release Nevercade this side What room do I have for any more of those?
5008414	5013517	Honestly enough You can hang them from the roof I have a very tall ceiling
5017280	5043785	I don't know, I'm just like they're cool I like the little collectibles but I get it all they have to do is make sure they have a decent emulator built into the system they'll play the games as close as natively as possible and boom, there you go and PodCulture you can buy broken Saturns that have functional optical drives replacing them is not that hard
5045873	5048756	And DT says, yeah, there's a cart you can get to.
5049476	5050897	There's like a ROM loader one.
5051137	5054320	I just, you know, I like the originals.
5055861	5062446	I will say that even though my office, what you see on camera, is full for the space of the arcade games, they're off screen.
5062486	5068210	You don't see it, but there's a walk-in closet over here that I would be able to clean up pretty easy.
5068311	5071493	And the walk-in closet I don't think could fit the...
5071553	5074535	The Burger Time, it's just a little too tall, or the Tron.
5074795	5077977	But what it could fit are these little baby machines on shelves.
5078317	5086182	And so if I do end up picking up a couple more candy cabs or little baby machines, I probably will start to quote-unquote build out the walk-in closet with some of those.
5086862	5092085	So there is still space for little things to grow, just not any more big machines.
5092405	5093626	But I guess I could always flip it.
5093666	5097628	I could fit one more big machine here and move these guys in the closet.
5097688	5097889	That's...
5098969	5120002	maybe because um Alan and I keep looking at a Mortal Kombat 2 cab that has internet connectivity and it has all the old like Williams games like joust and shit in it and I'm like oh if I had to get a machine right now that's the one I'd get but then we also need to be responsible and buy other things than our arcade machines so
5120382	5130390	I wish they had like one of the arcade one-ups that was all the midway driving games like Arctic Thunder, Hydro Thunder, you know, San Francisco Rush.
5130490	5130990	Oh, hell yeah.
5131931	5132592	All that stuff.
5132812	5134093	I guess Russell 2049.
5134133	5138036	I don't really play the new ones, but yeah, that would be cool.
5138776	5140678	Oh, PodCulture says, I have that cab.
5140838	5141859	It has Tapper too.
5141939	5145141	Yeah, it looks like a solid cab and it keeps going on sale.
5145582	5147163	It's very tempting, but you know.
5148998	5154100	We need to look at big boy purchases as well and not just more arcade machines.
5154680	5156580	The little baby will hold me over for another year.
5157861	5159761	Alright, moving on.
5159781	5162562	We just have a couple more stories for you and then we'll get to the classic game of the week, Loki.
5164082	5167663	Yeah, so there was... I don't know how this stuff got out.
5168023	5175786	I saw one story that it got leaked and then now it's up on Internet Archive, but apparently an old...
5177845	5191278	They say E3 2K build and Halo 1 Spear Test, which was the early, early, early, early version of Halo that was the game before it was a first person shooter.
5191338	5195321	So it was a third person shooter is now available to play.
5195862	5198524	You can actually get the E3, the 2003 E3 demo
5202008	5203669	through the internet archive.
5203769	5207031	They have it hosted there to check out.
5207671	5211794	I swear I saw that there was more stuff that leaked out about it.
5211934	5220819	I don't know if it was a hack or a leak or something like that, but there was a bunch of code and source material that was available that was from all of this stuff.
5220919	5225321	But I know this was one of the things that did come out of it that was kind of neat to check out.
5227743	5227863	So...
5228905	5251797	you're interested they've got it to check out it does look certainly different I love to see like these like conceptually like here's what it was before and you know that that whole type of thing I think that's really cool it's it's nice yeah to have this news coming out when you have the negative news of you know the Cartoon Network games vanishing into you know space at this point it's just yeah
5252850	5253090	Yeah.
5253671	5267969	Well, along those same lines, the last story I have for us tonight has to do with the website Hidden Palace, which, you know, kind of finds a lot of old ROMs or things in development and looks a lot a lot of things like that have changed or what have you.
5269191	5273978	So apparently there was a bunch of Nintendo prototypes that were found.
5274578	5283711	They were acquired by the guy that runs SideQuest Games and is apparently one of the organizers of the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, which I'd love to get to next year if I'm able to, by the way.
5283931	5285313	I've always wanted to go up there for that.
5285914	5286914	One of these days I'll get there.
5287615	5292496	Apparently the prototypes were graded and then released.
5293476	5303139	So now there are all sorts of prototypes that are available at HiddenPalace.org, including 1943, the Battle of Midway.
5304220	5306200	There's an Addams Family prototype.
5306220	5308841	There's too many here for me to list, but just some that jump out at me.
5309201	5311562	Bionic Commando has a prototype.
5311642	5312942	Fester's Quest prototype.
5313062	5314803	Gun.Smoke prototype.
5315563	5337935	um Mickey's Ultimate Challenge, Shadowrun, Solomon's Key um apparently some Genesis prototypes were also uh released as well Beyond Zero Tolerance and Dominus uh and uh also some other prototypes Rygar, Legendary Wings uh and then even more so like there's just a ton of stuff that showed up
5338435	5339597	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5359676	5388426	there's an earlier copyright date so it shows copyright 1986 and the publisher is credited to Romstar as opposed to Capcom so that's kind of interesting so but that's otherwise it doesn't sound like a whole lot is really really different with the game but still it's neat to see these things like as frozen in a particular part of time so all right well speaking of things frozen in time once a week here on this show we'd like to take a trip down memory lane so let's get to it
5399187	5406469	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5406929	5409470	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5410470	5413350	Alright, and I think DarkSakura's been waiting to talk about this one for a while.
5413590	5415411	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5416491	5418152	It is Dragon Age Inquisition.
5419232	5421472	Now 10 years old as of December.
5422593	5424033	So, um, yeah.
5424473	5425293	One of my favorite games.
5426134	5427974	I would say of the modern era.
5430236	5430416	What?
5430776	5432457	I said 10 years old.
5432757	5434317	Alright, alright, alright.
5435178	5451963	So, at any rate, it did come out in 2014, technically November 2014, and developed by BioWare, published by Electronic Arts, and the third major game in the Dragon Age franchise.
5453543	5458345	You play as a character called the Inquisitor, eventually called the Inquisitor,
5459245	5480526	um who gets caught up in the middle of um events coming right after Dragon Age 2 um spoilers the Chantry gets blown up there's fights between Templars and mages and kind of have to know the universe to know what that's all about and at this big conclave where they're supposed to be working out their shit um
5481500	5506514	um someone blows a hole in the sky and the inquisitor has the one means of closing it by a i guess a power surge on their hand um and i'm not going to go too far into it it's a involved game it gave us there's some very interesting fun behind the scenes facts like about uh iron bull's dick did you know about that all righty
5508830	5530201	I've been to those horny parts of the internet and then I ran away screaming Usually a lot of the male characters in there are rendered, you know, Ken doll style They rendered his junk And then when it finally caught that they rendered his junk They replaced it with a big black box And you can see that when you fly cam
5532586	5532786	There.
5533286	5534607	There's Dragon Age stuff for you.
5534847	5536087	Lovely.
5536908	5537368	Tidbits.
5538708	5539028	Bits.
5539869	5553253	But anyway, Dragon Age 2 kind of got, well, people fussed at it because they were reusing assets and it was set in one place and it didn't have a lot of the complexity that Origins did.
5553753	5558435	Although the biggest improvement that that game made is having your character freaking talk.
5560138	5581979	that's what annoyed it's kind of what annoys me in Baldur's Gate as well is not being able to like really experience the personality of your character but at any rate though a lot of that was taken into account when the game was being designed so it is an action roleplay game but
5583200	5596407	EA wanted firstly for the game to be developed in one of their own in-house engines, the Eclipse game engine, but it wouldn't have worked for an open world.
5596567	5602330	So they used Frostbite 3 that had been used before for Battlefield, the Battlefield games.
5603410	5618557	and so they started working making multiplayer Dragon Age product called Blackfoot and then doing a bunch of work in it which led to them cancelling the Exalted March DLC intended for Dragon Age 2
5620078	5639373	um so they they really just started you know pushing things the problem frostbite was also made for first-person games but uh it didn't have the ability to have stats game saving conversations cut scenes any of it from RPGs
5640013	5650522	or animate like quadrupeds or certain custom characters so um they really had just a rotten time with it and then um
5652515	5655658	They ended up, though, working their way through it.
5657840	5667488	Very unstable builds of it and trying to work with that and a few other in-house tools.
5668009	5669250	But they did get it out there.
5671252	5676876	They were afraid that the popularity of mobile gaming would also hinder console game sales.
5677797	5682558	So this pushed BioWare to release it for older systems as well.
5682678	5693761	So as far as the releases it had, it was intended just to be released for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, but there were then PS3 and Xbox 360 releases too.
5695302	5696762	And it really just put...
5698098	5717197	A lot into trying to make those games work on the earlier systems So yeah, they had some problems with it But they did manage to put out a fairly decent masterpiece, I think It was really, really good
5718197	5747110	you had wide open spaces to explore you could play different kinds of characters you had your NPCs you had your team members and a twist I'll be honest I saw it coming because I knew the lore I saw it coming the thing about Solas who is now the I'm gonna say that he's an antagonist in the current game in Veilguard but
5748248	5777378	maybe like you have your more forceful antagonists like Ghislaine and Elgarnaan but he's like the overarching antagonist but he's also like not an antagonist in the fact that he's a very complicated character and that's really what a lot of people called out is that in Dragon Age Inquisition you had this very complicated character everybody was complicated they had their own motivations their own things going on
5778278	5799169	and they didn't always all get along like a lot of the dialogue between certain characters is just absolutely perfect for how hard they snap on each other but this built off of something that came from DLC for Dragon Age 2 where they had found like one of the old uh
5800269	5815352	Magisters who were responsible for the blight coming into the world and now he wants to you know he's come out of the fade and he wants to go back and make himself a god so of course that's bad news for everybody and you see some returning characters like
5816098	5819999	You can bring back Hawk, your hero from Dragon Age 2.
5821199	5827340	Cassandra, who was interrogating the shit out of Varric during Dragon Age 2, comes back, as does he.
5828501	5830701	You have Liliana from the first game.
5831021	5833241	I think she showed up in two, briefly.
5833682	5835162	You even see Alistar.
5835342	5837282	You see a lot of people.
5837322	5839483	There's references back to the Warden if they lived.
5840383	5841603	Morrigan is in the game.
5842123	5845164	So you have a lot of characters coming back and
5846304	5860758	it was really there was some pretty fun fan service in there for people and they remembered their lore they got it right um they this it had what I wished Veilguard had been able to maintain um
5862245	5889782	there's a lot of drama with Veilguard including laying off some of the writers for the game but we'll go back so anyway they were able to get different artists to come in for some of the background art elements including the character cards and in-game artwork statues, all kinds of things
5890722	5904014	and they did have a pretty decent character AI for your companions when they fought, but you could also move them around and assign tasks to them.
5904974	5907857	Like I said, you could play different classes and different characters.
5907897	5912280	You could play a Dalish elf, you could play a human noble.
5913121	5917445	You could play a kunari, you could play a dwarf.
5917625	5921529	This is also, I think, the first game you could play a kunari as a player character in.
5923871	5928395	And then you had, you know, your mages, you had your rogues, and you had your warriors.
5929256	5930717	So, all really good.
5930777	5933480	I think that the character in this one was very well done.
5934180	5941068	and it picked up all the pieces left over from the previous ones.
5942329	5948556	And while you get Hawkback, they were saying that they didn't bring the Warden from Dragon Age Origins in because
5950686	5952387	First of all, there was no established voice.
5954588	5965595	And they didn't have a means in there to make a character that would resemble their version origins, which I think is, I mean, they could have done something.
5966455	5988645	and the warden was going to appear in the Here Lies the Abyss quest with Hawk but they cut that out in development so they actually had a crime reporter inspect all of the Dragon Age media to be sure that Inquisition hadn't deviated from the lore and
5989085	5996108	and they even had their own internal wiki to keep track of their characters and all the lore which I think is hilarious.
5997208	6008112	You had a gift system in the game to make friends and romance people and make friends or push people away and punch soulless which was in there.
6009133	6026296	um there was an approval bar but they removed it because they wanted it to be more subtle a little bit more real life um they they were as far as romances too they were focusing on characters um
6027182	6027783	and DarkSakura.com
6045910	6046631	I love Dorian.
6046971	6050898	He is their first fully gay male character.
6050998	6053743	Sarah was their first full lesbian character to my knowledge.
6054865	6057189	I like that you had people that
6058756	6081734	were who they were does that make sense what I'm saying about that yeah they just they were although I would have loved to have had an ace character you know just saying but I think that that it was it was really good the way it was handled they had a trans character who was handled perfectly and voiced by Jennifer Hale I'm just gonna say this right now long live Krem um
6083376	6107080	just amazing amazing and the the music in the game was pretty pretty awesome um they had a new composer Trevor Morris um to bring in a different as they say emotional flavor to to the game um they did high uh quality dynamic audio so they wanted it to be
6107900	6136575	very immersive and they were using the audio functionality in Frostbite to accomplish that so they also removed some tasks that included tagging animations and sound emitters so that they could focus on producing the high quality sound that they wanted to but a lot of the story moments for audio programming was scripted by hand
6139091	6158721	There were songs that were made for a character named Meriden Halliwell, who was voiced by Elizaveta Kriponova, who was a bard in the game, like an actual musical bard.
6159621	6184966	and so in fact her songs were actually so popular that they did the Bard songs that you could download between January 26, 2015 and February 9, 2015 but they are available elsewhere they marketed the shit out of the game I had been waiting for this the really neat thing that this one had was the Dragon Age Keep
6186178	6195508	So you could go back and instead of like a save file migration, it was very, very in-depth.
6195588	6200633	You could make your whole major decisions that would have affected the game.
6200693	6204697	You can bring them over by creating them in the keep and then importing that into your game.
6205958	6212944	and in the keep you could also access Dragon Age The Last Court which is a companion game although it's been deactivated since 2020.
6213004	6221570	There were a minigame called The Quest for the Lead Lyrium Reapers that was on the Dragon Age Inquisition website.
6223051	6230517	Different promotional rewards in the minigame and then you could get it in a special delivery chest on patch 11 in October 2015.
6230977	6233079	There was a golden Nug statue and
6233859	6262325	that if you've already completed the playthrough you could synchronize your collections of items to bring them over kind of a new game plus-ish and then there were the digital deluxe editions you get the OST and different in-game items like a throne made out of a dragon skull that was cool they had DLC, the Jaws of Hakkon which was really fun and definitely threw a wrench into some of the established lore that people thought was there um
6263206	6270277	and then the Black Emporium came out for free which is also present in Veilguard 2 for exclusive items.
6271379	6276227	That was the one that let you have the Mirror of Transformation so you could change the appearance of your Inquisitor which is now just, you know,
6277396	6278977	in the Lighthouse in Veilguard.
6280798	6287582	And they were working on ways to transfer your save games to newer hardwares.
6288182	6295687	The spoils of the Avvar had new in-game items, schematics, customization options, just all kinds of stuff.
6295747	6303511	And then the last DLC, Trespasser, was basically set two years after the game and is...
6305052	6308513	Basically, it's like, what the hell happened with Solas?
6309394	6311715	Yeah.
6312295	6319818	It was pretty good, and I think was the nice ending to that story and the setup for Veilguard.
6321138	6327619	This game won amazing kudos from various facilities.
6328560	6337021	It did not get any lower than an 8 out of 10 from any reviewer, or no less than 4 stars.
6338982	6343803	The highest score, there's a 5 out of 5 from Joystick and 9.5 out of 10 from Polygon.
6346243	6351965	People were saying that it was fun and colorful and that the expansion really brought a lot to the game.
6353546	6360908	They thought that some of the story was a little bit more by the books, but it felt like there was...
6362615	6388058	more than what could have gone on but there was a lot of potential for more to happen and there were people who thought it didn't have the heart of the previous games but still it offered like actual decisions that you would stop and agonize over and that really showed their effect in the rest of the game that you played I mean you have one right at the start for like who you're going to side with the mages or templars um
6388818	6408728	and it was a fully realized world it was really really big you know you go all kinds of places and you would always find things to explore and you had to kind of learn your way around just like you know you were new like you were new to an area um it was it debuted at number five in the UK on its first launch week
6410929	6414670	and sold almost exact amount as Dragon Age 2 did.
6416231	6420792	It was considered the most successful launch in Bioware history based on units sold.
6421413	6431017	As of September of this year the game sold over 12 million units in its lifetime which surpassed anything the EA had projected.
6431497	6434158	It was to that date Bioware's best selling title.
6436039	6436699	Awards.
6436979	6442881	It was nominated for Best PC Game and won Best RPG at the Game Critics Award.
6442921	6446443	The Game Awards 2014 won Best Roleplaying and Game of the Year.
6447183	6452245	Dice Awards Game of the Year and Best Roleplaying MMO Game of the Year.
6454186	6463830	It's won Game of the Year just from a bunch of different awards and won a Special Recognition Award by the 26th Annual GLAAD Media Awards.
6465984	6489660	well done there I'm not going to go too much more into Veilguard but this game is absolutely amazing I still go back and revisit my characters from time to time I modded the shit out of my game yeah it was great and
6491440	6520616	I can't say enough good things about it I thoroughly thought I've probably beaten that game a dozen times I have all kinds and I always like the first time I played it I did do the soulless romance so when I played Veilguard I brought over that Inquisitor like you don't get nearly the customization in Veilguard and I'm disappointed by that but every other playthrough I found my Garrus and it's Cullen even though his voice actor is an ass
6522051	6544903	but that that he's my Garrus in this game I have him a Bari plushie I have a Nug plushie well you've beat this 12 times oh yeah his politics are bullshit bullshit he's a turf um you've beat this game 12 times meanwhile I'm still stuck in the hinterlands um so you know that's
6545831	6559507	different experiences but you have Scout Harding and she's adorable and then you can play with her in Velguard yeah, I do need to go back and actually finish this game someday we'll just add that to the list of things to do
6560819	6567141	Well, you know, Gareth David Lloyd played Solas, and you know what else he was in for our Doctor Who fans?
6567741	6571022	He was in Torchwood as Ianto Jones.
6572042	6576303	And, you know, joining... Yep, PodCulture knows it.
6577083	6580724	And then joining Eve Miles, who played Meryl in Dragon Age 2.
6584960	6593206	so so yeah oh and this was the last game to feature Flemeth and you know who voiced her?
6595107	6612579	Kate Mulgrew oh shoot okay nice yeah so yeah really really really good stuff lots of tie-ins for a lot of other franchises that we love but yeah so the game is Dragon Age Inquisition alright
6613157	6615058	Good pick, even if it falls into the hole.
6615218	6617478	I can't believe that's 10 years old.
6618839	6619399	But it is.
6619459	6623920	Well, since it's been kind of shoved down my throat that it's 10 years old, I think I can very well believe it.
6624020	6624600	That's fine.
6625180	6625520	All right.
6625720	6627541	Dragon Age Inquisition, your classic game of the week.
6628481	6632682	We have just a few more headlines we're going to run through quickly in a segment called Rapid Fire News.
6632982	6634723	So, Loki, we'll go to you first.
6635768	6649070	Yep, so we have some DLC coming out for a mod for Fallout London.
6649290	6656231	Yes, so they have three pieces of DLC that are coming out later this year, so that's pretty awesome.
6656612	6664233	You already get essentially a total conversion on the game, and then they're adding what was previously cut content and some stuff that they're adding.
6666345	6668707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6689484	6709733	whatever reason they replace all the spiders with Astro Bot and it's funny because they actually play like the Astro Bot theme song as it's going so they're kind of charging towards you and stuff but it's certainly a lot cuter than the actual spiders in game so I thought that was kind of funny that's cute, I like that idea DarkSakura, what do you have?
6710753	6714115	I did just come up with what I'm going to do for my one-off game
6716063	6716824	Like Game of the Week.
6718065	6719626	Oh, that's going to be weird, but fun.
6719706	6720407	I mean, in a good way.
6720507	6721128	Weird in a good way.
6722168	6725171	Well, yeah, like the Action 52 and stuff like that.
6725451	6726032	Oh, God.
6726132	6726512	All right.
6726792	6727052	Okay.
6727233	6727713	I'm into it.
6728888	6729648	Alright, anyway.
6730929	6738234	Squinnix put out a questionnaire asking what input fans had for the future of the Final Fantasy series.
6740275	6742856	It is a 10-15 minute Final Fantasy questionnaire.
6743757	6753262	They posted this on the site that I don't visit, but I will see about copying the link and putting it here in our chat if anyone's interested.
6756364	6757565	But yeah, I think that
6758206	6759008	They want to hear us.
6759348	6760069	Why not answer?
6761572	6764738	And here, I'll put it there so you don't have to go on to the site that shall not be named.
6766485	6767525	Alright.
6768726	6770407	And how about a Fortnite story?
6771007	6786253	We have Cyberpunk 2077 is making its way to Fortnite with Johnny Silverhand, that of course is Keanu Reeves' character, and V, the female character from the game, are coming over to Fortnite.
6786833	6792015	Apparently it went live earlier this week, and you can get the characters and accessories and all that stuff.
6792576	6794616	And yeah, there you go.
6796397	6797198	Are we surprised?
6797258	6802400	Not really, because CD Projekt Red has done other things through Unreal and all that.
6802440	6809124	The first trailer for The Witcher 4 is in Unreal, and we've had characters from The Witcher series that have shown up in the game before.
6809964	6814787	Also interesting to note, this is Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite.
6815567	6818489	So you can do Johnny Silverhand versus John Wick.
6819875	6847671	by the way can I talk about John Wick for a minute because I was on a flight back from Nashville and I wasn't really you know I was kind of like in and out of sleep and sometimes if I'm really bored and zoning out I'll just kind of notice what the person in front of me is watching on their TV and they were definitely watching John Wick which I had never seen before or knew anything about but and I couldn't tell you what the plot was because you don't hear the audio because they have headphones on but I was like is this movie's plot is literally if Johnny or excuse me if
6848811	6853314	If Keanu Reeves does not shoot somebody through the face every 15 seconds, the movie ends.
6853914	6856015	That is very clearly what John Wick is.
6857156	6858796	Loki, are you a big fan of John Wick?
6859857	6862078	I've only seen the first one, I think.
6862098	6863399	Just struck me as a Loki movie.
6865460	6866000	Yeah, they're good.
6866020	6867781	I like them.
6868461	6870482	It's just shooting people over and over and over again.
6870522	6871063	Shooting people.
6871103	6872443	That's all that movie is.
6874745	6875705	Yep, pretty much.
6876986	6877226	Anyway.
6878936	6902266	but now you can do Keanu Reeves versus Keanu Reeves in Fortnite and I'm sure many fanfic writers will have a field day with that, enjoy alright, with that that is all of the stories that we have, but we do have some release dates, maybe this is like last week, probably a terrible week for release dates but we will check in with the world anyway so Loki, we'll go to you first
6903824	6904644	Well, there's not much.
6905665	6909166	There's really only one game that's weathering waves on PlayStation 5.
6909746	6910726	Weathering waves.
6910826	6912167	I wonder what... Weathering waves.
6912187	6913067	Weathering waves.
6913247	6914948	Okay.
6915068	6918749	Traveling to Japan, I do not see anything on the Switch this week.
6919369	6922230	And on the PlayStation 5, I don't see anything either.
6922330	6928872	We don't really have games coming out in Japan again until Ys is coming out, I believe, in the new year.
6929552	6930533	But that's it.
6931633	6933374	No, that's actually not even a Japanese release.
6933415	6933715	I'm sorry.
6934195	6936237	Those are showing other regions.
6936977	6941641	Freedom Wars looks like the first release on PlayStation 5 in the new year on the 9th of January.
6942181	6943543	So we have a little ways to go.
6944503	6945984	DarkSakura, same story in the UK?
6948066	6949147	Yeah, just two things.
6949667	6955152	We have the Resident Evil 2 remake for iOS and Mac.
6956728	6964092	and on January 1st, Wuthering Waves 2.0 for PS5.
6965472	6967573	Some folks in chat talking about Wuthering Waves.
6967834	6971555	QuestBuster says it's like a sci-fi Genshin Impact, if that helps.
6974157	6975857	Deft says, if anything, it is free to play.
6978058	6981060	Those games have gotten a lot of fans that way, that's for sure.
6982352	6984974	Alright, now we go to the listener roundtable.
6985655	6991240	If you would like to give us a call, we have our Discord open over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.
6991660	6994643	I would encourage you to join the Discord and chat with us throughout the week as well.
6995444	7003071	You can email us as well, participate at orangelondrader.com, but I think I caught before the show that we don't have any emails tonight, right?
7004335	7007418	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7027957	7036442	Um, and the first one is from Fifth Dream, who is saying games we wanted to play this year and just didn't.
7037322	7039244	Oh, I'm sure this is a big list for many people.
7039684	7042105	A game you wanted to play this year and just didn't.
7042465	7046067	I'll start because mine is a whopper because I kind of can't believe I didn't get around to it.
7047088	7049729	In fact, this is going to surprise some of you because I bought the game.
7049749	7050530	I still haven't played it.
7051350	7052411	Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
7055635	7073277	I just I got distracted I played other things one of these days I'll get around to playing it but yeah it's one that I fully I wanted to play it this year and I just I just didn't that's the topic I can't think of anything I think I've played everything that I was interested in
7075322	7076062	Loki, what about for you?
7076082	7077503	I mean, I even played What the Fog.
7079124	7083647	I mean, there wasn't really much that I was looking forward to playing this year.
7085007	7088649	Grand Theft Auto 6, no, but that'll be next year at this point.
7089470	7091531	No, nothing that actually came out.
7092812	7093832	I don't know.
7094052	7100416	There's nothing really that I didn't play that I didn't, I guess.
7101888	7105571	Final Fantasy maybe, but I wouldn't have played that anyways because I haven't finished the first one.
7107432	7109553	Yeah, I think I played everything.
7111578	7138261	Pod Culture says a new OLR dream game which is funny because we kind of got into that earlier in the show and I said hold on because I think we have a bleed about this and so here's the thing is that with OLR dream games usually they're best thought up on the spot you know it's hard for us to kind of say you know I feel like when we're kind of hand molding something that doesn't come up in natural conversation it's not really an OLR dream game but we did get
7138982	7161296	the you know president cat in space earlier so um I don't know I'd probably go with that for me I don't know if my co-hosts want to chime in on that but all right well then we have one more uh from Dark Tetsuya who says we got a PlayStation 5 for Christmas and funny enough one of our
7162301	7164842	Fast Favorites is the Pinball FX line.
7165403	7168584	So any recommended tables to pick up are greatly appreciated.
7169005	7172326	We did just get the latest Williams pack featuring Black Knight 2000.
7173247	7173987	It's a tough one.
7175328	7178590	Shucks, I have to remember what tables are even in Pinball FX.
7179110	7182432	But if I'm not mistaken, you know, Pinball FX has some of the old classics.
7182912	7187735	I really think... Oh my God, I'm blanking on the names.
7189822	7191323	You know this one, DarkSakura.
7191523	7192344	There's two of them.
7192424	7198329	There's the one with the spinning lamp, Tales from... Arabian Nights?
7198369	7199450	Arabian Nights, that one.
7199470	7201112	I thought it was called Tales for some reason.
7201132	7202233	That's a Papaduke one, I think.
7202273	7207497	That one, and then the one that's very similar with the big escape case in it, the magic game.
7208778	7209399	Theater of Magic?
7209419	7210420	Theater of Magic, that one.
7211001	7211761	Why can't I remember these names?
7211781	7213382	You mean the one that I have in my dining room?
7213402	7215104	Yes, yeah, I can't remember the names.
7215184	7216024	I'm sorry, I'm getting old.
7216064	7216705	I'm getting to that age.
7216885	7218165	Melody's Favorite Pinball?
7218586	7219846	Theater of Magic, yes.
7220047	7226891	Those would be, I think those are like just, because what I like about those games too is that they don't really tie into any other property.
7226931	7233115	I'm like, sure, the Addams Family table is great, you know, but like those tables just kind of really speak for themselves.
7233735	7234335	Does that make sense?
7234776	7245084	But DarkSakura, I don't know if you have... I know that you've got the real deal in your house, but Pinball FX is a much cheaper way to get into pinball.
7245404	7247506	I don't know if you have any recommendations for tables to check out.
7250588	7252750	I don't know what all is on Pinball FX.
7254831	7256913	I could look at the list real quick and see if there's anything.
7257013	7258214	I mean, definitely Theater of Magic.
7258994	7260355	Arabian Nights is also a really good one.
7261476	7262217	Is World Cup on there?
7263502	7264643	DarkTetsuya says World Cup is on there, really?
7288599	7312485	World Cup is a really good one that is my absolute favorite pinball Rocky and Bullwinkle I think is on there which was the first one that we owned I want to say I cannot find the list of games that are on it pinball FX game list
7314141	7315742	There's a ton of them at this point.
7316662	7318923	I'm just kind of naming random tables because there's a ton of them.
7319083	7325345	So I just figure there's a really good chance most of the big ones from the 90s and after, unless there's a big licensing issue.
7327025	7330327	Yeah, I don't see any of it.
7330527	7336289	But, I mean, if you see something on there and you want to ask me about it, message me.
7336829	7337389	I'll tell you.
7338509	7340690	Oh, and my husband would recommend Elvira Scared Stiff.
7340970	7341730	I think that's his favorite.
7341750	7342911	Yeah, Scared Stiff, definitely.
7345064	7357397	Yeah, World Cup is still my favorite Alright, well if you want to bleed us throughout the week, at Orange Entredo is the place to reach us on Blue Sky But with that, hey, we still filled out You know what?
7357618	7357778	What?
7359181	7363323	I don't think I like Bleat either because it sounds too much like Tweet, which sounds too much like the other site.
7364183	7366064	I like Post.
7367104	7371086	That's actually the official line, too, from Blue Skies, that they're called Posts.
7371866	7374207	To which everybody will always reply, no, they're Skeets.
7374887	7375207	Shut up.
7375948	7378249	Whoever came up with that bullshit, because that's terrible.
7379349	7383171	Alright, well with that, we're going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lingerie.
7383211	7384231	Actually, wait, I should check in.
7384291	7386672	I doubt there are, but I'm going to check with Loki if there's any last minute stories.
7388396	7388616	No.
7388736	7389877	I had a feeling that would be the case.
7390437	7394138	Anyway, thank you as always for listening to another episode of Orange Dawn Radio.

7428811	7432792	We are the word, or we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7433512	7437194	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, um,
7438945	7440085	Actually, it's not iTunes anymore.
7440105	7441746	It's just Apple Podcasts is what they call it now.
7441766	7450309	So whatever, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show, those five-star reviews have gone an awful long way, and we really do appreciate them.
7450389	7451029	So thank you so much.
7451049	7452569	iTunes hasn't existed for like a year now.
7452849	7453109	I know.
7453130	7454730	It's habit, right?
7454770	7457331	You memorize the spiel, and habits are hard to break.
7458051	7459431	I still call it iTunes even if it's not.
7459492	7459732	All right.
7461926	7462386	That's it.
7462746	7464507	We're going to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.
7464848	7466308	Bobby Blackwolf will be back next week.
7466408	7467249	We'll be back next week.
7467629	7474233	And since it will be the first show of the year, I think we ought to open up our 2024 predictions and see how that went.
7474533	7477734	So we're going to do that next week.
7477774	7480136	We can do our game of the years of 2024 as well.
7480316	7480916	I guess we can.
7480936	7482317	If you have any, sure, we can do them.
7484273	7492116	we'll talk about that alright, with that let's wrap up so DarkSakura, I'm assuming you are streaming as always tonight?
7493176	7504780	yeah, I'm gonna go back and do DBD I wanna finish the Bone Chill stuff I might play some Killer if no one's gonna join me alright, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
7506680	7509601	um reject false icons?
7510782	7512062	why not go with an old classic?
7513430	7526794	Yeah, also, it never dawns on me that my mom is in her 60s until she tells me that she needs to get a, quote, smart TV.
7529715	7530996	But I like the dumb TV.
7534837	7537678	I'm just like, Mom, it's not hard.
7538829	7544653	No, what gets me is when people who I consider to be in my age group are tech challenged.
7544693	7546214	And I'm like, I can do this.
7547055	7552038	Just like, you know, I'm here for people, but would it kill people to read a manual?
7552719	7553800	Will it kill you to read a manual?
7554140	7556081	RTFM, read the fucking manual.
7556822	7557682	I'm in pain.
7559684	7561185	I'm in emotional pain.
7562406	7563606	All right, get to streaming.
7563626	7564307	We'll see you in a little bit.
7565248	7566829	I'm internally screaming right now.
7567512	7568193	Later, kids!
7568614	7569015	Goodnight.
7569195	7569496	Bye.
7570438	7572341	Alright, Loki, we'll go to you and your final thoughts tonight.
7573463	7575487	Yeah, just still working on the Minecraft stuff.
7575507	7579514	Hopefully I'll have that done soon so I can finally put out my episode and end the season.
7581791	7607287	and my final thought is I will be streaming this week I just don't know when and I think I'm going to play a game I've been talking about for a long time it's my first game I want to beat for 2025 so I'm kind of coming up with a mental list of all the games I want to play so hopefully I can beat them that's the thing where I'm like oh god has my skill regressed a lot but I may do some games not in hardcore mode so I can just save state my way like I think at some point in the year
7607867	7609167	I really want to do Blaster Master.
7609187	7609708	It won't be first.
7610028	7611608	I'm going to have to save state that one.
7611968	7614549	That game is too harsh when you're done.
7614589	7616690	And there is no battery.
7616710	7619310	I would have to do it all in one sitting, which is not going to happen.
7619350	7620891	So I'm going to have to do a save states in that.
7621411	7623291	So I'll have to opt to bend.
7623852	7628153	I didn't say I won't beat them without using some of the modern things, but I'm going to try to use them sparingly.
7629213	7629473	All right.
7630914	7631214	Anyway.
