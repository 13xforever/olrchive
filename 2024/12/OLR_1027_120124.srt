00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

2
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:48,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,871
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:51,371 --> 00:01:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live back once again on the 1st of December, 2024, episode number 1027 of our show.

5
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:05,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:06,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

7
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:07,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, how are you?

8
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:18,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot to do at work that I have to get done in two weeks.

9
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:24,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be balls to the wall, as they say, whoever they are.

10
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:31,269
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had all these plans of stuff I needed to get done during the week I was off.

11
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,251
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.

12
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:37,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear that.

13
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:44,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, my husband, Alan, has been very sick this weekend, and it's nothing that I caught.

14
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't come up on a COVID test, so don't know what he's battling right now.

15
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,474
[SPEAKER_02]: That was how it was for me and Dan.

16
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:54,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's weird.

17
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,357
[SPEAKER_02]: He is doing the Mucinex thing, though.

18
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh he's uh you know just unfortunately he's been out of it so didn't get to take a trip to Ikea I was thinking it might be a good thing to do because I actually I want to replace some of the stuff I have behind me here I now have a second little mini arcade machine it's a new one that just showed up well actually y'all might remember this I I asked for this for my birthday from the birthday fairy uh which is an odd name for my husband but sure we'll go with that the birthday fairy um he actually pre-ordered or pre-purchased

19
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:31,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go to Ikea I need to look for a couple of smaller storage shelves because I am in the middle of redoing my office

20
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:52,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

21
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Officially.

22
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.

23
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where I'm at is that I just, if I could, I have a little bit of room.

24
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:04,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to see on the camera, but I have a little bit of space between my arcade one-up machines and there's a little space with the wall over here.

25
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:16,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I kind of move them a little closer together, I think I'll have just enough room with the couch here to fit a kind of a better, a more stable countertop for two arcade top machines, which will be nice.

26
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:17,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

27
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:43,523
[SPEAKER_02]: because after that I'm out of room no more because we keep joking keeps joking like oh there's a full-size Mortal Kombat machine that's a hundred dollars off oh there's a Pac-Man it's literally that where will we put it we are out of room hey that's where we are like we need a bigger house Dan's like I have to reorganize my office so I can fit Metallica in there right now Metallica's in the middle of our hallway wow the whole band yeah

28
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:47,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, they all fit in my hallway.

29
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:47,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

30
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, standing up, they could probably fit in my hallway.

31
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,611
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, yeah, the machine is there in the hallway.

32
00:03:55,432 --> 00:04:02,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've got, because I've been going through just pockets of stuff, like, because I knew I was going to be going through this room, I sort of just threw stuff around.

33
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've got pockets of sorting bins that I've bought at Daiso.

34
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:14,346
[SPEAKER_07]: that I'm just using to break down what goes in what room, what's an art supply.

35
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:20,631
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my biggest thing is all my hordes of art supplies, which I will probably be putting together care packages.

36
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:21,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

37
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:28,317
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, by the way, Rob, did you know that you are going to be the recipient of one of my donor cards?

38
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard from donating during your subathon.

39
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to get in there early, early, but then I had to run to the drugstore for Alan, and then I was going off to the Bay Area for Friday.

40
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:55,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a collection of semi-rude cards semi-rude like my favorite one is the one that says thank you for the gift that shows how little you know me you know they're just snarky I thought they were fun so excited

41
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:59,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, let's see what kind of snark he has for the holidays.

42
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Techmaster Loki.

43
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,999
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Loki?

44
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I'm good.

45
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:07,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Any home improvement projects on your end, since we're talking about trying to rearrange things to make space?

46
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:08,885
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you?

47
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You're approaching, is this the last day of your two-week break?

48
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

49
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, Loki.

50
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace to your break.

51
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:17,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a decent one overall?

52
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:19,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

53
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I got stuff done.

54
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:25,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, best of all, you got to take a break from your day job.

55
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's nice.

56
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:28,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

57
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:34,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had like the last... I took most of last week off, so I've had like six days off in a row or something like that.

58
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:35,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been nice.

59
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The only bummer is with Alan's sick.

60
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of really limited.

61
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanksgiving for me was... I basically had to leave Alan here, and I went out and took my dad out.

62
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:48,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just me and my dad for Thanksgiving, which is fine.

63
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I got to see my dad.

64
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:54,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had to leave Alan at home for a little Friendsgiving I did yesterday.

65
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:55,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like...

66
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:59,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel really bad for him.

67
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:02,582
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a shitty time of year to be sick, but what can you do?

68
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:03,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

69
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:04,544
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully you're feeling good, Loki, even if you do have to go back to work tomorrow.

71
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as good as you can on a Sunday night when you know you have work tomorrow.

72
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:14,391
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

73
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

74
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:27,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll make the best of this Sunday night by talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all of you in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

75
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:28,639
[SPEAKER_02]: That's V-O-G Network.

76
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,101
[SPEAKER_02]: 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

77
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:35,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you can find us each and every week.

78
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are, of course, watching chat.

79
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people talking about Ikea brands in there.

80
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:47,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw also mentioning, I go back to work tomorrow, but work closes for the holidays from December 20th to January 6th.

81
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:53,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I used to work for a company like that that took the entire two weeks off like it was winter break from school.

82
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:57,595
[SPEAKER_02]: My current company doesn't really do that, but I'm okay kind of where I...

83
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:58,916
[SPEAKER_02]: All is well, all is well.

84
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:21,658
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Rogi, Loki.

85
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:40,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

86
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:49,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we've got a brand new patent that's been filed by Nintendo for what is assumed to be the next game console that they have.

87
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:59,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this is, is basically a tech patent that allows their console to work seamlessly with mobile phones.

88
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:05,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the actual patent itself talks about, I believe, additional displays.

89
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:21,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's saying that basically the game console itself will determine a second image that includes the connection destination information and be displayed on a secondary display device.

90
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:29,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially using phones as kind of like an additional screen or something like that.

91
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be cool.

92
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:39,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but it's also definitely not the first time we've seen the phone as a, you know, secondary device.

93
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:53,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just any, any, I mean, that and just anything as a secondary device on a Nintendo console, because we used to do that a lot with like the, I don't know if the DS had, I guess the DS did have some of that connectivity, but I know the Game Boy Advance for sure had that.

94
00:08:54,832 --> 00:09:17,340
[SPEAKER_01]: with like the GameCube and stuff like that so it's not the first time we've seen something like this it makes sense that you would see like another like a phone as a possibly a you know input device on even like some things like I can see like integration with like a Jackbox game or something like that I mean I technically do that now but that's the game I think of is that Jackbox games yeah

95
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,200
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

96
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,814
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

97
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: But wasn't that supposed to be a thing with the Amico?

98
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:10,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole fact that you could use your mobile phone as a controller In fact, I believe what they actually put out Remember the whole Amico app?

99
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:15,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever they actually put out was that silly app that had some of the games in it

100
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:21,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You could tell the app was just going to be the OS for the Amico system at some point.

101
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you needed two phones, right?

102
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:27,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You needed one to service the Intellivision, and then the other to be your controller.

103
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:30,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Intellivision was supposed to use this as well.

104
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So for as much shit as we give Amico...

105
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Nintendo doing something similar, although, to be fair, I would say Jackbox was the first place I really remember seeing it.

106
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:44,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it was the first to ever do it, but it was the first place I really remember seeing it was the Jackbox part.

107
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:57,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wouldn't give much credit or any credit to the Amico, to be honest, because, like, I mean, with that, they were like, well, the controller is integral to be able to play these games, and then they're like, but, you know, you can just use a mobile phone to do that.

108
00:10:57,835 --> 00:10:58,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

109
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, well, why do I need...

110
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:05,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I need a console for these mobile games?

111
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:06,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you all have phones?

112
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:08,032
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.

113
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,493
[SPEAKER_01]: We're playing on them.

114
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,756
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's a console need to be here for?

115
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:14,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like additional Android devices just in the way.

116
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.

117
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:16,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

118
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,260
[SPEAKER_01]: They were smart.

119
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,862
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have just had an app on like, you know, these smart TVs and there you go.

120
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,823
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your Amico console.

121
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,184
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download your console for free.

122
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where you would think things may have ended up at the end of the day.

123
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

124
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of just stopped caring.

125
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to be 100% honest.

126
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I just stopped caring about it, especially after the sale of everything but the Amico to Atari.

127
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of one of those things where you're like,

128
00:11:42,290 --> 00:12:10,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's going to happen I am assuming at this point the Amico is full on vaporware that it's just not happening ever and I've come to accept that if one day one of them shows up at my house because yes I pre-ordered one call me what you want I don't care I'm already over it like you know it's then one shows up as a pleasant surprise but even at that I wouldn't expect much out of it at this point because that console is supposed to be out five years ago so yeah

129
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think there'll be anything coming.

130
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:19,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bobby says, to be fair, we only put a deposit on one.

131
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:19,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's true.

132
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:22,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure they would happily charge my bank account for the rest of it.

133
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:29,617
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to need to... Well, actually, the card that they would have is so old at this point.

134
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all those cards expired.

135
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a totally different credit card, that totally different bank and everything from when I first pre-ordered.

136
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they'd have to find all that information.

137
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:44,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So until they come asking me for my new credit card, I'm assuming it's never happening.

138
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, look forward to my autobiography someday.

139
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Tommy Tallarico owes me $100.

140
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:56,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he?

141
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, he has your pre-order.

142
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why it's very few Kickstarters and very few of these pre-order things I'll ever do again.

143
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:11,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the Electronic Gaming Monthly one.

144
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's one.

146
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just checking, actually.

147
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:44,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny, no, I was checking Kickstarter earlier in the week because I saw one of these games.

148
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,225
[SPEAKER_01]: They were advertising an update.

149
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:48,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, did I ever get that from the Kickstarter?

150
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, it was in my library still.

151
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten that.

152
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,572
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was one, though, that still...

153
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:59,826
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

154
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:27,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just helping.

155
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:31,394
[SPEAKER_02]: That dollar goes to the VOG fund, not Rob's bank account.

156
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:32,014
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's all right.

157
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:32,454
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

158
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:36,215
[SPEAKER_07]: How much of Rob's bank account goes into the VOG fund anyway?

159
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:39,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think he's ever going to show us?

160
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's still doing video games live, right?

161
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:42,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

162
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:43,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.

163
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:43,698
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

164
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:44,398
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

165
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,499
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just not going to disappear off the face of the earth?

166
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:46,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

167
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:49,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby says Tommy's a backgammon champion now

168
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

169
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:09,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

170
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:13,977
[SPEAKER_01]: All those prize pools for backgammon, you know, that can pay off the Amico.

171
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the old G4 guy at our old network is an ice cream guy now.

172
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:21,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I'm jealous that that's not nearby.

173
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,986
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually has some nitrogen ice cream.

174
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds pretty good, to be honest.

175
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:26,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't hate on that.

176
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I had no idea.

177
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby says he won a world tournament in Monte Carlo.

178
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, good for him.

179
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:38,495
[SPEAKER_07]: According to go to Monte Carlo for a tournament when he owes people all this money.

180
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:39,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

181
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, like if he had just like

182
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:47,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Skip the whole Amico section and did the backhand and stuff.

183
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,753
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be thinking a little more favorably of him.

184
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:54,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the weird thing, and this is the last I'm going to say on it.

185
00:15:54,897 --> 00:16:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know there's always a thousand haters every time you just say Tommy Tallarico three times in the mirror and the YouTube comments will get flooded with haters.

186
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:07,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get it, and I understand why people... The man has a bit of an ego.

187
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:07,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

188
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I don't think...

189
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not bad, he's just drawn that way

190
00:16:38,451 --> 00:17:04,977
[SPEAKER_02]: a thief and an aloof foolishness not that I'm excusing it but I'm just saying I don't think he's a bad guy I just think he made a lot of bad decisions yeah I think when they got to like their second or third funding round that they probably should have questioned their intent at that point it's like okay yeah that was the point I knew I wasn't seeing my money again

191
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:08,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

192
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

193
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,745
[SPEAKER_02]: But now all the other fundraisers, or not fundraisers, but crowdfunding.

194
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:29,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all the other crowdfunding efforts have to pay for it because I won't back one again unless I personally know the person or that there's an actual end product that we're looking at type of thing.

195
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:40,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I backed one recently in August for these marble run things through the company Rocker, which I've got my wooden pinball machine that I still haven't finished because I haven't worked on it.

196
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:44,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But the marble kit's cool and they actually showed up, so that was kind of nice.

197
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:45,467
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all bad out there.

198
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:48,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are some, but it's not all bad projects.

199
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:51,892
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to do your research on if they're more established or something like that.

200
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:57,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in the case of some of these indie games and stuff like that, you have to do a physical release or

201
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:19,959
[SPEAKER_01]: you know something more specific you just have to look at the track record of the group although that said i mean like and even like the amico stuff with like who was like involved with it like it sounded like a good thing at the time but i didn't get it but i was like well at least they'll release a product it just won't be it'll be like an uya you know and not necessarily good but it'll be a product little do we know

202
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,373
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no Mariah Carey ever.

203
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Whamageddon began today.

204
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I would rather Whamageddon than the Mirai Apocalypse.

205
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:53,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

206
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought it up yesterday.

207
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yesterday was still November, though, so that we're still technically safe.

208
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:07,219
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I was like, listen, I might stop playing that song.

209
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:16,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead, my wife decided to turn it up and then also teach us or convince our son to learn it on piano.

210
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:17,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

211
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:22,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, can your son actually play?

212
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot for you.

213
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it, yeah.

214
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:27,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's so good.

215
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty soon your wife is just going to yell out, it's time!

216
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:36,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I think she's signing that video too.

217
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,457
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

218
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:38,818
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

219
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:47,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to dig myself a hole in the backyard and stay there until December 25th and then bust out all my Hanukkah stuff.

220
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm going to hire a Klezmer band to follow Oli all around.

221
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the same kid that's playing the recorder?

222
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you got two kids, Loki.

223
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:58,262
[SPEAKER_02]: One's on the piano.

224
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:01,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the other one on the recorder to start playing.

225
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:02,623
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's not going to play the recorder.

226
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:05,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play the recorder.

227
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a bass recorder.

228
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,962
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

229
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I played stuff and I bought stuff.

230
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a bad idea that I bought stuff because I'm actually trying to save up for some things, namely an OLED Steam Deck.

231
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:53,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But I played, well, I had that subathon on Black Friday that only a few people really came for, but it was cool.

232
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I had fun.

233
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:07,755
[SPEAKER_07]: um I uh I played uh of course Dead by Daylight played a lot of it we had a whole session a whole round where we got to pet the puppy for the new killer he's a good doggo um

234
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:26,369
[SPEAKER_07]: then played Polya, played Dragon Age The Veilguard Dan and one of his pinball buddies Jeff, he came over and they were playing The Legend of Zelda and Zelda 2 in the other room so that was going on in my house

235
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:51,963
[SPEAKER_07]: um then uh I also I've been playing uh the Suica game and I got another game that had been on my list and it was really cheap so I got Fruit Mountain which is like the Suica game but in more 3D on like a plate you have to stack and match up the the food until it forms like the different fruits and whatnot

236
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I also picked up Arcade Spirits.

237
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:56,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Battle Chef Brigade.

238
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:58,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Last Faith.

239
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And I picked up Toho New World.

240
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And also Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite Deluxe Edition because it's marked down to 11 bucks.

241
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:32,528
[SPEAKER_07]: because uh it why not why not you know I just did it because of reasons um and yeah I uh I've just been doing my my own stuff um happy oh and um Hecht mentioned something about a team making a wrestling game that's worked off a reverse engineered N64 wrestling engine and yes I have seen this um

242
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:41,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had a beta of it downloaded at some point very recently, but I haven't played it.

243
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:45,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was based off of WrestleMania 2K for N64.

244
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:46,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do have that.

245
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also have something that I will be talking about today for Classic Games.

246
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:53,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

247
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Rewinding a little bit to Dead by Daylight.

248
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: For those not aware, the new killer in Dead by Daylight is the Houndmaster, right?

249
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:04,555
[SPEAKER_02]: She's glorious.

250
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:07,179
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a pirate lady who has a dog.

251
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,100
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog is the mechanic.

252
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,001
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog will chase survivors.

253
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Your dog's name is Snug.

254
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:11,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the dog.

255
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Mori is literally step on me, mommy.

256
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:25,175
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part that cracks me up, is they actually turn step on me, mommy into a Mori, because you know what she does?

257
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:30,199
[SPEAKER_02]: She steps on you, and it's actually kind of gross, but you don't see anything too gory.

258
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead by Daylight is still kind of cartoon violence.

259
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed something.

260
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:35,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I was perfectly fine.

261
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:36,855
[SPEAKER_07]: My Meg was protected by the power of the pig.

262
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:53,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to ask what we think of the new killer.

263
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:57,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was watching... I haven't played yet, though.

264
00:23:57,247 --> 00:24:02,070
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was watching Nick, our pal, Nick and Prince, who I'm sure you raid him a lot.

265
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we talked about him before.

266
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:05,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you and I both enjoy watching him.

267
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And he plays a lot of killer in Dead by Daylight.

268
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:10,796
[SPEAKER_02]: He was not enjoying his time with her.

269
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:11,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

270
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:12,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

271
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess apparently the dog is really bugged.

272
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And does not run.

273
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some clips on his channel where he's like...

274
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:20,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Go here, dog!

275
00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:23,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dog suddenly teleports to another part of the map.

276
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:25,064
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just some weird shit.

277
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:25,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cat.

278
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:26,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad dog.

279
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad dog.

280
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:27,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bad dog.

281
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:31,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So he seemed to be getting really frustrated.

282
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get the skin, though, so I could get the poodle.

283
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:36,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And I swear, if you look at the poodle face on, it looks like the Wraith.

284
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

285
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the way that the poodle's floofy hair goes, it looks like the little pointy part on the Wraith's mask and everything.

286
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:43,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

287
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:45,717
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so weird.

288
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,258
[SPEAKER_02]: The killer's design and everything I think is fine.

289
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody has a problem with that.

290
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,179
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks great.

291
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And her voice acting.

292
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:56,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm going to be honest.

293
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we've talked about things in video games that are hard to deal with.

294
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Like DarkSakura, you've mentioned before you don't like clowns so you don't appreciate when we talk about the killer clowns game or even the clown is in Dead by Daylight and I'm sure you do not like seeing him show up.

295
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you what I'd do to him.

296
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:15,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I forget.

297
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:16,709
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do for clowns?

298
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: He wears the chicken mask, so I don't have to look at him if I have to play him.

299
00:25:19,892 --> 00:25:21,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, when you play him, you're the one that dresses as chicken.

300
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:22,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

301
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:23,195
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

302
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:26,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I have him in a regular outfit, but I put the chicken mask on his head.

303
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:26,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, got it.

304
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:27,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

305
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:30,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last time I got my adept with him, it took me five minutes.

306
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:31,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Less than that.

307
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:32,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Less than five minutes.

308
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you remember.

309
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:36,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how many listeners know this.

310
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I have issues with big dogs.

311
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes back to a childhood thing.

312
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:47,674
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was five years old, I was bit by a dog and it was kind of like hysteria and all these things happened.

313
00:25:47,734 --> 00:26:02,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will just say the last time I had a full-on panic attack was because a big dog was off a leash, owner nowhere to be found, basically threatening me unprovoked.

314
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I was trying to mess with this dog or anything.

315
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point is...

316
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little worried how I'm going to take to this whole thing, but I've been watching it.

317
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:19,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like, all right, like I think because it is a video game and my brain can really kind of like separate the two and I realize it's not like a thing.

318
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:22,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus that whole thing for me has actually gotten better over the years.

319
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I used to, I used to not even do this.

320
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:28,443
[SPEAKER_07]: When 1-2 was live, you were over here when Will was here and had 1-2.

321
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:40,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's gotten better, but it's one of those things where the less I think about it, the less... But when I was watching Nick's stream, it sort of came to my mind where I was like, wait a minute, I don't like big dogs.

322
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:47,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like saying that because every dog owner wants to fight when I say that, so I hope people will understand the difference.

323
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:50,913
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean when I say I don't like big dogs really means...

324
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:57,419
[SPEAKER_02]: My upbringing caused me to have this brain reaction when dogs do these things to me unprovoked.

325
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean when I say I don't like big dogs.

326
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure your dog is a princess, but I'm just saying generally I have issues.

327
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Just flat out do what I do about the snail and slug thing.

328
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:11,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got trauma around that.

329
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:14,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and most people get it.

330
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:18,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that you don't like them.

331
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:22,209
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably nice and personable, but you have trauma around them.

332
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:23,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all of that.

333
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:30,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, small dogs even used to kind of bug me, but we're kind of past that point now.

334
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:32,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tolerate small dogs pretty easy at this point.

335
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:34,738
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some of them I think are rather cute.

336
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandma used to have a Dachshund when she was with us who I thought was cute.

337
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:39,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I love corgis.

338
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:40,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I love corgis.

339
00:27:41,602 --> 00:28:08,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play with a corgi corgis are basically fat fucking cats like they're divas and they have the cute butts and I'm honestly not allergic to them I just found out so dog fans I'll meet you halfway corgis but the big dogs can stay locked up in the thing over there and I'll appreciate it from a great distance please don't get any closer

340
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:19,763
[SPEAKER_07]: This might just be me, but looking at the two dog models, though, for Snug, like the poodle and the... Oh, someone told me what it was.

341
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was a mastiff, but it's another kind of dog.

342
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:28,965
[SPEAKER_07]: But look at them, like, right in the face, and, like, the normal one looks...

343
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, kind of looks like a good boy.

344
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:34,872
[SPEAKER_07]: But the poodle looks evil.

345
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid the poodle.

346
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:43,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Which tracks because my grandparents had poodles.

347
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:44,219
[SPEAKER_02]: My other grandparents.

348
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:48,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So my dad's mom had the Dasha and my mom's mom and dad had the poodles.

349
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:51,064
[SPEAKER_02]: My uncle had an Afghan.

350
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:53,866
[SPEAKER_07]: My uncle had an Afghan.

351
00:28:55,053 --> 00:29:03,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to ask your opinions on the killer I still had a gaming week Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done See?

352
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:14,846
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they say about assuming Oh, the other thing is that I found my copy of Tetris 2 for Famicom That's it Oh, interesting, alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

353
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:44,072
[SPEAKER_01]: um it was pretty much just working on Minecraft stuff so I was putting out content this week and then we're just working on the big water ride which I didn't finish but I've got a lot of work done on it so it's looking pretty nice yeah all right that's about it I saw you were pushing more shorts to your channel this week yeah it doesn't matter like I looked at my last 90 days I've lost 50 subs so how the fuck does that happen

354
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:47,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect you to know the answer.

355
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:48,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, were 50 accounts banned?

356
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:48,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

357
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

358
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big number for no reason.

359
00:29:52,167 --> 00:30:09,159
[SPEAKER_01]: So, essentially what it is is my channel this entire year has been flat for like the last 365 days aside from when I because I got tired of seeing no growth of the channel so I was like, okay, let's try one of these YouTube promotion things.

360
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And that worked okay, but there's a lot you shed a lot of subs off of that as well because I don't know

361
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:19,770
[SPEAKER_01]: BOTS are picking up on the advertised stuff, which is weird.

362
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:28,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had mixed results with that stuff in the past, but it certainly seems like the stuff integrated through YouTube is awful, and it's not...

363
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they don't really push my content I put it out short for example, I put it out short yesterday um

364
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:00,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's only been viewed about 50 times.

365
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,395
[SPEAKER_01]: But now if I delete that and re-upload it, it may hit like 2,000 views.

366
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:06,777
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.

367
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Their algorithm is stupid.

368
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:11,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is.

369
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,668
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's... There's not much I can do about it.

370
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:16,449
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most popular.

371
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:20,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I have stuff on TikTok.

372
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:24,667
[SPEAKER_01]: It is... That is even worse than YouTube.

373
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.

374
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:27,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm telling you, I don't know what it is.

375
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:40,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as of habit, whatever it is you make, because it's the same video, and now especially that YouTube can go up to three minutes, you know, the same short should go to YouTube, TikTok, and I think Instagram is also three minutes at this point.

376
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,951
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can do threads now, too.

377
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just don't...

378
00:31:44,011 --> 00:32:11,617
[SPEAKER_01]: it just doesn't your audiences don't cross over really with that stuff I find so it just doesn't make sense for me to do that and then just in general like you know this stuff that I'm doing now it is tough like I had someone reach out the other day and they looked at like some of the stuff I'm doing on my channel and like tried to help out with like why they think you know people are not doing it but like the stuff that their feedback was based off of like

379
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:36,207
[SPEAKER_01]: watching a video the problem is that people don't watch the videos at all so like you can't even get to that point where you're saying well it's because your first like 30 seconds weren't engaging enough or whatever the case may be but then also like you have to change the entire style of how you make content then if you you know and do you want to like do you want to be authentic or do you want to jiggle the keys in front of the like the babies watching your your content like I don't know

380
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,164
[SPEAKER_01]: What necessarily I need to do there.

381
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:45,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that struggle is that basically you feel like that advice is like, be totally inauthentic.

382
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:46,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, what am I doing?

383
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty much.

384
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:49,897
[SPEAKER_01]: People want a product.

385
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:50,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that.

386
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,502
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, have you tried making videos more like Mr. Beast?

387
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:53,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like...

388
00:32:54,884 --> 00:33:24,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to and there already is a MrBeast I think it's cheap when people try to emulate him sorry not sorry I think people that try to chase those trends are I think it's very transparent very transparent there's a lot of different styles of how to make like SMP content and I've seen like I know because I look at other SMP content and see like what they're doing and they're doing the same thing if not like less quality and it's still getting more views and it's like

389
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:26,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do here.

390
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:31,160
[SPEAKER_01]: You always hear the advice of, well, just put out better content.

391
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out pretty good content.

392
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:37,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, you just need to

393
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Make better thumbnails then.

394
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:42,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I don't know how... What do you want me to do?

395
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:54,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm already, like, turning up the saturation because, you know, for whatever reason... And I'm saying babies, but I'm, like, comparing, like, people with extremely short attention spans, I guess.

396
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, like, the bright colors shown in the face.

397
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's so stupid.

398
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm, like, building content for, like, a non-human person.

399
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:04,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just...

400
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:05,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

401
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:11,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, I need the bright and shiny and the loud noises shouted into my eyes and ears.

402
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:14,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the frustration.

403
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:17,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're repeating ourselves a little bit from last week, but that's okay.

404
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the frustrations for sure.

405
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:32,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're sticking with it, at least in staying true to yourself in the whole process, because if nothing else, this will be a time capsule of who you were and what you did during this time frame, just to show

406
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,900
[SPEAKER_02]: has done for us over two decades.

407
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:44,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And for better or for worse, you go back to the old shows and it's like, oh, some of it's kind of cringe, but then it's like, oh, some of it, wow, we actually kind of called a couple things there.

408
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just kind of need to see these things.

409
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bobby, and I get it.

410
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,774
[SPEAKER_01]: There are younger viewers, but it's not necessarily the case.

411
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:56,617
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually quite a lot of people that are much older that are watching content.

412
00:34:56,657 --> 00:35:00,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing, is there is content that's built that way where it's very...

413
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:06,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick Cuts and Shouty and just oversaturize the hell and all that stuff.

414
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:10,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't appeal to these people, whereas there's other types of content out there.

415
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:18,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at demographics and stuff, and I had at one point, there was a lot of my age people watching the content.

416
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:22,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's... I'm not really making it for kids.

417
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:29,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be a stretch to say that, okay, if it is an older crowd, could it be that your content is...

418
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:36,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Lens Itself Well to the mom or dad or parent, whatever, can watch with their kid.

419
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:38,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's for both.

420
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:40,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's for both.

421
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:40,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

422
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:44,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's hard to say because it's hard...

423
00:35:46,269 --> 00:36:08,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know because like one other thing too as I look at like you know large creators like the Hermitcraft creators problem there is they have such an ingrained audience it doesn't really matter what they do like they can make videos the old school way of making videos like minimal editing just build and talk to camera and that's it and

424
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,980
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get away with that because they already have the established audience.

425
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily... They're getting more viewers because of who they already are.

426
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:25,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do that in the same way because I don't just get invited to a large server because of timing and everything.

427
00:36:26,904 --> 00:36:31,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, right now, there aren't really larger servers to go to or more popular servers.

428
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:36,066
[SPEAKER_01]: There's short-term SMPs, but those are so clicky that...

429
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:47,564
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same group of people in all of these SMPs it's the same people just jumping between these different projects so yeah it's hard to

430
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:50,024
[SPEAKER_01]: are the same.

431
00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:54,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more evergreen than a lot of content, too.

432
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:55,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's appreciated.

433
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:07,482
[SPEAKER_01]: The people from my server were visiting today, and they were just checking out the plushies and stuff, because that was the thing I put out last week, is I built this whole redemption system with...

434
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:30,921
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, you play the games you get the little prize tickets like you do at Chuck E. Cheese or something like that your ticket games so everything spits tickets for free, because it's the end of the season, and then you go and grab your tickets, you run over to the machine and it redeems a random plushie that pops out and they were entertained for at least a few hours doing that

435
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:51,745
[SPEAKER_01]: so it is they appreciate it I just wish like other people would be excited about it as well because it's hard to like get into these large projects if no one cares like that's the thing I killed myself last season like really like putting together a lot of stuff with the Mega Man builds and it's like no one saw it like it

436
00:37:52,445 --> 00:38:14,514
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I don't know a lot of people in chat just saying it's luck it is so yeah keep keep scratching those lottery tickets all right uh let's see moving on let's talk about my gaming week okay well speaking of like all is old is new again oh I can't believe I'm gonna admit this but I also don't care I'm kind of at the point where I'm like I don't give a fuck you can say whatever you want about what I'm playing I have been playing World of Warcraft

437
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:20,378
[SPEAKER_02]: because the classic version of World of Warcraft relaunched this last week.

438
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:23,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I mean is World of Warcraft... It's a classic classic?

439
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

440
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's classic classic because...

441
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:28,565
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft turned 20 years old, believe it or not.

442
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:29,766
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is old.

443
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:32,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And in celebration of that.

444
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:35,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you know, but there was Classic WoW.

445
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: But now Classic WoW has progressed through different... They kept, I think, two or three servers forever on Classic.

446
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they started moving servers through Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King...

447
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,982
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

449
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:50,304
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's been fun like it's been especially considering you know with everything with Alan being sick and stuff I've just been kind of stuck at home I haven't really wanted to play something new or flashy like sometimes you just want to go back to good old comfort food you know like why why do I keep playing this silly game you know what because I like it it's just it tickles the brain waves I want to have tickled it's like going back to watch the same old TV show or the same old movie it's very that

450
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:58,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of movie, I'm very sad because we had tickets to see Wicked on Wednesday night and we had to let him go because Alan couldn't go, but I feel bad he's sick.

451
00:39:59,215 --> 00:39:59,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sucks.

452
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully he'll get better.

453
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

454
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:03,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That?

455
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I really played a lot else new in my gaming week.

456
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:07,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just that.

457
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:16,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been on just a little bit of a break from my own YouTube channel and creating videos, but I'm looking to getting back on the bandwagon this week.

458
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:29,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, now I have confirmed the YouTube Shorts thing works, meaning now if you upload a video over a minute in length, but under three minutes, it automatically goes into the...

459
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow Shorts thing now.

460
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:35,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will be catching up on my backlog of classic shorts.

461
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:37,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

462
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:39,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, PodCulture says he has a handful of wow codes for Mountain Dew.

463
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:39,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

464
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:40,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'll take them.

465
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:41,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

466
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:41,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that.

467
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:42,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

468
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:47,511
[SPEAKER_02]: On a completely separate sort of note, I promised one of our listeners something.

469
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:47,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

470
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

471
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:20,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is something from Ranma.

472
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:21,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see what this is.

473
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:24,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

474
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:25,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already see.

475
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:26,426
[SPEAKER_02]: This is funny.

476
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:31,753
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a DarkSakura and Loki present, I'm sorry to say.

477
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:34,697
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very much a Rob present when you see what this is.

478
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:41,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the dead air silence.

479
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:42,775
[SPEAKER_02]: How much pumpkin spice is in it?

480
00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:43,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, none.

481
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Richard Simmons pop figure.

482
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,636
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, very much a Rob present.

483
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:53,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have bought you one.

484
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:55,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

485
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ranma.

486
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:00,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

487
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:01,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's adorable.

488
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

489
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have gotten you a Richard Simmons thing as well.

490
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,136
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't know if I gave it to you or not.

491
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:12,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Loves it.

492
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:13,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

493
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

494
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:16,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

495
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says, I know how much Richard Simmons means to you.

496
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:21,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he was wonderful.

497
00:42:21,883 --> 00:42:27,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really, that's one of the shittiest things about this year is that he's no longer with us but, you know, what can you do?

498
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:28,247
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?

499
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:32,465
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on and get into... Thank you again, Ranma.

500
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:32,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

501
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:36,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into... The holidays have officially begun.

502
00:42:36,528 --> 00:42:37,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I've unboxed the first present.

503
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:40,991
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.

504
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:44,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, for a holiday week, I'm surprised we actually have a bit of news.

505
00:42:45,414 --> 00:42:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also say this as a reminder.

506
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:50,017
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not be here in two weeks.

507
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:54,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be out of town on the 15th, so I won't be here.

508
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be taking a break after next week.

509
00:42:58,302 --> 00:42:59,123
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, in the meantime,

510
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:03,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura, I can hear you ruffling wrestling over there, just FYI.

511
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's something I needed to grab real quick.

512
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're fine.

513
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, let's get into the news.

514
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:22,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is going to come as a shock, but corporations who put out mobile games that have loot boxes in them and that make so much money, they might not necessarily follow the laws when it comes to

515
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:24,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

516
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:54,939
[SPEAKER_01]: in their advertisements under the current regulations.

517
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:04,343
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, of those 45, 26 were labeled as including loot boxes, and 22 of which were actively advertised at the same time.

518
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:15,508
[SPEAKER_01]: The given example of Monopoly Go, which is a very popular mobile game, does not correctly advertise the usage of loot boxes in its game.

519
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:16,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

520
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's only because the penalties for not doing so are probably very minimal.

521
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:28,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say that where's the... Yeah, and SJ100 Matt in chat says, this is what happens when you don't hold folks accountable.

522
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, there's my next question.

523
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:30,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the accountability then?

524
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:31,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

525
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:51,914
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

526
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:16,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

527
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:18,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the follow-up story.

528
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:20,707
[SPEAKER_02]: What is their response?

529
00:45:21,507 --> 00:45:28,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Their response is this is an ongoing area of our work and we're closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.

530
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,651
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, they don't have a handle on it.

531
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:36,706
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too hard to regulate this.

532
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:39,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and to be fair, it is.

533
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:44,529
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many mobile games and mobile apps.

534
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:46,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hard to regulate, yes.

535
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have the top games completely ignoring the rules, I mean, at least look at the top 100 and start making examples of some folks.

536
00:45:57,073 --> 00:46:00,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you get everybody else to go to the rules real quick.

537
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you can really force that with advertisers.

538
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:13,072
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically say, although it's upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things.

539
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:16,873
[SPEAKER_01]: They will go to a company and say you should comply, but then they don't comply.

540
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:27,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and it is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.

541
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:52,652
[SPEAKER_02]: so what is the point of this whole point is we should be calling them surprise mechanics surprise yeah yeah and uh you know a couple people in chat Hector's pointing out they're short-staffed right now everyone's short-staffed right now as Joe and Hunter Matt says they don't have the personnel to track these down or follow up on claims that involves hiring staff to do this which they aren't doing so I mean then we might as well all admit the rule is pointless

542
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:57,016
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do?

543
00:46:57,257 --> 00:46:57,717
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?

544
00:46:58,818 --> 00:46:59,098
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

545
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:02,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about one of the biggest mobile games out there right now.

546
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:09,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much you have all messed around with the Pokemon trading card game pocket, but I actually have been playing.

547
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:17,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but I've actually been playing this game a lot because you get two free packs a day to open and I have it on.

548
00:47:18,174 --> 00:47:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I know 11 a.m.

549
00:47:19,515 --> 00:47:20,316
[SPEAKER_02]: and 11 p.m.

550
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:21,817
[SPEAKER_02]: are when my packs come up.

551
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:23,518
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll open up a free pack.

552
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:27,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not spent a dollar on this game and I still feel like I've gotten quite a bit out of it.

553
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've done a lot of these limited battles and things you can do in it and the card collecting.

554
00:47:33,323 --> 00:47:42,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I've added a few of you from our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord as friends on the game and doing what... I've gotten some good cards from some of you people in the Wonder Trade type of thing.

555
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:45,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I like the way they did it.

556
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:48,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought I would get into the Pokemon trading card game.

557
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did the...

558
00:47:50,911 --> 00:48:07,136
[SPEAKER_02]: The way Dina, or whoever is the studio behind this, did this game where they really made the focus, the collecting of the cards is really the focus of the game, and the actual card game itself is a scaled-down version of the Pokemon trading card game.

559
00:48:08,336 --> 00:48:09,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like the sideshow.

560
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:12,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actually the main feature of the app.

561
00:48:12,878 --> 00:48:14,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a really brilliant way how they put it together.

562
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's...

563
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:18,520
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

564
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:43,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

565
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:45,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the list here.

566
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:46,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

567
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:50,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.

568
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:55,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before I get corrected in chat, that event just launched.

569
00:48:56,695 --> 00:49:03,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still noteworthy to say that this stuff was datamined before that event started, I think yesterday, which is actually a Venusaur event.

570
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:27,131
[SPEAKER_02]: EX card event in the game which I have a very good fire deck by the way to go up against this but the way I do everything the other awesome thing about the Pokemon trading card game is that when you go into these battles you can just set it on auto battle and you don't ever have to actually play the game you just let the computer do the whole thing for you and sometimes you win sometimes you don't but if you have a pretty good deck

571
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:54,527
[SPEAKER_02]: you usually win more often than not and you can get some of these cards in your inventory and of course everything is on a stamina mechanic as you would expect so you can only do so many of these you know so many a day but you know as long as you go in there and you do a couple a day it's pretty easy so like I went into my game and there's the event going on and you can actually you'll notice there the bottom corner is a little switch auto off but if I turn that to on

572
00:49:55,469 --> 00:49:56,469
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

573
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:18,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, and Shane's in chat saying, if only it was a Venusaur, since that would have been nicer to have a Fulard of.

574
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:23,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane also points out that Magnemite, which was in the leak, actually was not in this event.

575
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:25,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be something that's coming later.

576
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:27,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they did do...

577
00:50:28,746 --> 00:50:29,887
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

578
00:50:45,220 --> 00:51:01,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the point behind all of this is, this game is big enough now where people are trying to, you know, heck, of course, with Pokemon being involved there, without surprise, people are trying to datamine the app updates to figure out what are the things that are coming to the game and all that good stuff.

579
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

580
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:31,775
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently these pack points I didn't know this this article is saying that the pack points actually have an unknown expiration date so you want to spend those pack points which I haven't spent any of them I have like 600 of them I just need to pick up a bunch of cards that I don't have at some point because I think they're saying the first expansion or the next set of cards is supposed to be out in January which would make sense you do every three months or so that's about four a year that's gonna be a pretty good one so yeah

581
00:51:32,395 --> 00:51:33,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we go.

582
00:51:33,196 --> 00:51:34,017
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture.

583
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,038
[SPEAKER_02]: We converted one.

584
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:38,441
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says, God damn it, I'm going to have to download this one.

585
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:39,062
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

586
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:40,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane, you should be proud of me.

587
00:51:40,923 --> 00:51:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We won one over.

588
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:44,547
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

589
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:45,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

590
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

591
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

592
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:49,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about some more news.

593
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:50,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

594
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:51,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura, what do you have?

595
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stuff.

596
00:51:56,783 --> 00:52:10,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So because, I guess, of reasons, I don't know what the reasons are, but Xbox is removing avatars, at least from Xbox One and the Xbox series.

597
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you have on 360 is still there.

598
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:31,093
[SPEAKER_07]: but nah, they were around but they're going of course we know they were introduced back with the Xbox 360 there was an update for them in 2008 and Microsoft was like, oh behind them you can buy clothes and do stuff with them and run around and cause havoc

599
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:56,757
[SPEAKER_07]: but then they just stopped supporting them bit by bit and now the support page for the avatars is gone and they said as of January 9th 2025 they will be removed from those newer consoles their avatars will not appear on profile pages and they say it's due to low engagement and the Xbox avatar editor is also going away too

600
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

601
00:53:02,622 --> 00:53:14,368
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing, if you purchased items for your avatars on an Xbox One or the series, since November 1st, 2023, you will have those purchases refunded.

602
00:53:16,052 --> 00:53:17,153
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of nice, at least.

603
00:53:18,014 --> 00:53:18,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

604
00:53:18,454 --> 00:53:20,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think I've really used the avatars.

605
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely remember setting up an avatar.

606
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:26,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely remember I had a Taylor Swift microphone.

607
00:53:27,864 --> 00:53:30,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't have it because it was Taylor Swift.

608
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:32,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, she's fine, but I'm not obsessed like a lot of people are.

609
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,412
[SPEAKER_02]: From the game Band Hero.

610
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:37,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when all the Guitar Hero knockoffs came off?

611
00:53:37,774 --> 00:53:38,515
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Band Hero.

612
00:53:38,535 --> 00:53:38,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

613
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:53,343
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had because I had a little pink strand on it and so my character would dance around with a microphone little pink strand I was like I love it so that was my like thing for forever but yeah I don't remember the last time I've seen that on the Xbox system to be honest

614
00:53:54,554 --> 00:54:03,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of faded out of view with all these dashboard updates they've done for the Series S and X. And they don't use them in the games anymore.

615
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:07,784
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point they were using them in the games, but again, I think that all faded away with the Xbox 360.

616
00:54:07,884 --> 00:54:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really seen them lately.

617
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, shout out to those of you still using GamerPix.

618
00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:16,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I still, to this day, have the OLR gamer pic.

619
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to fucking change it either.

620
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:18,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I?

621
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the OLR gamer pic on my profile, as some of you do too.

622
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:24,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Bobby Blackwolf has his little Blackwolf.

623
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,432
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get those gamer pics anymore, by the way.

624
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They went away a long time ago.

625
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:35,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever deal with All Games Radio and Xbox, whatever went through at the time, that got delisted after a few years.

626
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you maybe still have gamer pics from around that time.

627
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Sjohn Hunter Matt in chat says, I bought a hockey jersey for my avatar, so I guess I contributed to it, though I think not enough folks bought into it to keep it alive.

628
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:55,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked how certain achievements would get you clothes.

629
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:58,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where my Taylor Swift microphone came from.

630
00:54:58,237 --> 00:54:59,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I bought it.

631
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I had it from maybe singing scores and songs or something.

632
00:55:03,939 --> 00:55:04,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

633
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:07,220
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it was achievement related, and that was really fun.

634
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: and was a really cool thing they were supposed to do with PlayStation Home that I think very few games leaned into.

635
00:55:15,426 --> 00:55:35,480
[SPEAKER_02]: But this whole concept of achievements going beyond just a seal on your profile, which I know I've brought this up before, but the coolest achievements there's ever been was in the Atari 2600 days on the Activision games when you would take a picture of the screen when you got above a certain score and

636
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,321
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

637
00:55:57,477 --> 00:56:00,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can make patches and get them on Etsy and things like that.

638
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:10,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that whole way of really being able to show off your trophies on a shelf as opposed to just the checkmark on your profile.

639
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:15,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I guess now we have PlayStation 5 records the video clips when you unlock trophies.

640
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:18,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess there's that, but that's all there is.

641
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:48,571
[SPEAKER_02]: SG100 Matt says if you got that image of the OLR Bobby Black will show gamertag image and clip it you can upload it to your profile online oh that's gonna we have the original image it's very it's a very small very easy it's all pixel art so I'm happy to put that in the discord if anybody ever wants that Bobby will have to speak on his own logo but we can put the OLR one Loki made that actually that pixel art for OLR so I'm sure he won't mind we just give that shit away at this point so don't mind

642
00:56:50,373 --> 00:57:17,875
[SPEAKER_02]: we do have a similar one now that I think about it we have a VOG one that's similar it's like the same style but obviously it came later but it's a very very similar style so anyway and by the way my computer player won the match thank you very much Flareon, too strong anytime Flareon comes out I'm going to win that match because Flareon is fucking amazing anyway

643
00:57:19,012 --> 00:57:19,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

644
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:20,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do we have next?

645
00:57:21,694 --> 00:57:22,654
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

646
00:57:22,994 --> 00:57:29,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So Microsoft is blaming Google for the fact that you can't buy Xbox games on its app.

647
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's pretty straightforward why that is the case.

648
00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:42,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, of course, Android devices have to have all their apps go through the Google payment system, and they take a 30% fee from that.

649
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:46,486
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as you may remember, you know, with the whole Epic versus...

650
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:55,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Google Settlement or Court Case that now they're supposed to be allowed to go around that.

651
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,011
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to use those payment systems.

652
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:11,816
[SPEAKER_01]: However, right now, and this was shared by Sarah Bond on Blue Sky saying, I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S.,

653
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:25,644
[SPEAKER_01]: While other app stores adapt to meet the consumer demand, due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts from that court case, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned.

654
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:34,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, because there's a stay on that case, it hasn't concluded yet, and so now that's why...

655
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:41,987
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise they have to pay them 30% of all of the game sales they do which I don't think they want to share that.

656
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:47,492
[SPEAKER_01]: As should they because it doesn't go through Android at all.

657
00:58:47,712 --> 00:58:56,000
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense if you're running a mobile app through using the Google Play stuff but

658
00:58:56,954 --> 00:59:00,256
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying a game on Xbox, why should they get that money?

659
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:01,097
[SPEAKER_01]: They should not.

660
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:04,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get it.

661
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:13,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Pikmin Bloom, which I play a lot of the Niantic games now have their web store to try to get around the 30% cut or whatever.

662
00:59:13,745 --> 00:59:17,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Pikmin Bloom, you can freaking tap a link and it takes you to the web store.

663
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was actually kind of surprised that that's baked right into the mobile thing.

664
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, kind of interesting.

665
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:25,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hmm.

666
00:59:26,803 --> 00:59:28,285
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

667
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:46,902
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a bit, yeah, it's a bit ridiculous.

668
00:59:47,102 --> 00:59:48,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I get it.

669
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:55,605
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, they should get a cut similar to what a Walmart, a Target, an Amazon gets.

670
00:59:56,106 --> 01:00:05,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we want to talk about what would be, you know, take whatever the difference is between buying it at cost from the publisher and what the markup is for retail, that should be what it should look like.

671
01:00:05,889 --> 01:00:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's what that looks like.

672
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised that they didn't just...

673
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:27,770
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, like, because my, maybe they did, I don't know, I don't know enough details of what all the negotiations were, but, like, I would think that, obviously, like, if you think about it, I mean, surely they're going to try to get 30%, because if you're not going to fight them on it, then they'll be like, yeah, easy money.

674
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:37,618
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like, I would think at that point when it was like, well, no, we want to give you nothing of it, like, I would have almost wondered if they're like, well, okay, how about we negotiate, like, a

675
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:38,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

676
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, negotiate a flat rate, you're supposed to...

677
01:00:49,773 --> 01:00:50,254
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

678
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:24,764
[SPEAKER_01]: They still may have fought it, but I think that would have been a little bit easier for them to kind of come to grips with and probably would not have taken this to court, I would think.

679
01:01:27,507 --> 01:01:33,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, an issue that will continue to be developed is cloud gaming is going to get bigger and bigger, so we'll see.

680
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:41,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, moving on, let's talk about what shocking, shocking development the Nintendo Switch eShop is closing.

681
01:01:42,778 --> 01:01:43,039
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

682
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:44,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's closing.

683
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,070
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

684
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,207
[SPEAKER_02]: just in China is still a pretty big exception.

685
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:05,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Like China's a very big market for games.

686
01:02:05,648 --> 01:02:07,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is still pretty, pretty big news.

687
01:02:08,749 --> 01:02:12,531
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and I don't know, Jamie, I know you said it's about the crackdown.

688
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:16,353
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be, it might be, but we actually don't know.

689
01:02:16,473 --> 01:02:23,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody is stating a reason for why the Nintendo eShop is closing in China, but we do know it's going to be in 2026.

690
01:02:24,136 --> 01:02:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still a ways out, but on March 31st, 2026,

691
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:34,120
[SPEAKER_02]: The Digital Store is no longer going to sell games, no more free trials, and none of that is available.

692
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:43,223
[SPEAKER_02]: As of May 15th, 2026, Nintendo will stop download, code redemption, no more redeemable DLC, none of that.

693
01:02:43,723 --> 01:02:46,644
[SPEAKER_02]: All other network-related services close on May 15th, 2026.

694
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:47,525
[SPEAKER_02]: No reason as to why.

695
01:02:51,246 --> 01:03:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: but also kind of interesting there is a reward program that has been announced for the application WeChat which I believe is pretty big in China where you can get up to four Nintendo games from now until March 31st when this all wraps up and it includes some pretty big heavy hitters Mario Odyssey, New Super Mario Bros.

696
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:17,470
[SPEAKER_02]: U Deluxe Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Party so it's a lot of the big even Pokemon in here

697
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,071
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

698
01:03:33,228 --> 01:03:36,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But only people can infer the why.

699
01:03:37,172 --> 01:03:48,522
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that the government has been putting out more rules, trying to limit spending in online games, trying to curb this perceived video game addiction in young people and so forth.

700
01:03:49,143 --> 01:03:58,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And no idea what this means when it comes to the Switch 2, since we know that's a thing that is inevitably going to get announced at the beginning of next year.

701
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:01,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we can say that is a fact.

702
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:06,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be announced early next year because Nintendo has said before the end of the financial year they're going to announce the console.

703
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:07,359
[SPEAKER_02]: They've said this.

704
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But assumably at this point, not in China.

705
01:04:11,883 --> 01:04:15,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's going to be a different thing in China or different rules.

706
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:17,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the online.

707
01:04:18,048 --> 01:04:18,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

708
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,651
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot to figure out what that looks like.

709
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:22,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's...

710
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:25,110
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

711
01:04:35,165 --> 01:04:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know.

712
01:04:35,986 --> 01:04:36,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Too soon to tell.

713
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:44,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially when we don't really know the reason, we're just having to infer based on these different laws we see in China.

714
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:45,653
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet.

715
01:04:45,773 --> 01:04:47,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens.

716
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:55,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would expect when Nintendo announces Switch 2, you're not going to hear anything about territories outside of the U.S.,

717
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:59,163
[SPEAKER_02]: your typical European territories, and Japan.

718
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:08,968
[SPEAKER_02]: You may hear, you know, I shouldn't say the US, I should say North America to include parts of Central and South America in the places where Nintendo has traditionally had a presence.

719
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't, I think China's probably going to be left out of the conversation there early on in those announcements.

720
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

721
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:21,875
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt says, just wait for the Chinese knockoff consoles, aka the many Wii knockoffs.

722
01:05:22,015 --> 01:05:22,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean the V?

723
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nontendo V?

724
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was a YouTube out there.

725
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody playing one of those.

726
01:05:31,581 --> 01:05:31,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

727
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:32,802
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

728
01:05:33,442 --> 01:05:36,923
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you have next for us?

729
01:05:37,043 --> 01:05:38,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is some sad news.

730
01:05:39,124 --> 01:05:43,045
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a moment of silence for Humanoid Origin.

731
01:05:43,725 --> 01:05:46,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like this studio is going to be shutting down.

732
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:50,488
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a... It's only been around for three years.

733
01:05:50,568 --> 01:05:50,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

734
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:05,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a LinkedIn post where basically said that there was no way to protect the employees.

735
01:06:06,472 --> 01:06:11,974
[SPEAKER_07]: They were left with little funding and they could no longer sustain operations.

736
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:25,580
[SPEAKER_07]: and so it was really sad because they started building this whole sci-fi universe that was going to be put out on the AAA platforms out there but

737
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:41,001
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to stop and they were hiring as of May, but something flipped and the studio wrote, I'll read the quote, we're heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science fiction universe to completion.

738
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:47,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Our main concern at this time, however, is for our team and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment.

739
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:50,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

740
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:55,007
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very sudden with the hiring and everything.

741
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:55,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very sad.

742
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:05,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I expect a lot of things shifting during a transitional period, too.

743
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:14,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this also goes to show when, you know, we hear about layoffs in the industry, which are always, you know, hard to hear about.

744
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:17,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's that, well, they'll just go off and form a new studio.

745
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:21,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that doesn't always end in success either.

746
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:26,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think Casey Hudson left of his own, you know, accord, but I don't remember.

747
01:07:26,399 --> 01:07:27,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he laid off or did he leave?

748
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he left voluntarily, but...

749
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I can guess that a lot of these people that were working here were probably picked up from other studio layoffs and so forth.

750
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:40,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's kind of a bummer that their game didn't even really get to have a chance.

751
01:07:40,908 --> 01:07:42,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But it takes a lot of money.

752
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of investment to make a game, especially when you have a whole team of people behind it and you're making a pretty big game.

753
01:07:49,393 --> 01:07:52,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's sad when your game's not able to get there.

754
01:07:53,996 --> 01:07:54,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer.

755
01:07:57,038 --> 01:07:58,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on.

756
01:07:58,759 --> 01:07:58,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

757
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:08,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so of course, everybody has to leave at some point.

758
01:08:09,623 --> 01:08:18,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you've been at a company for a very long time, like in this case, Shuhei Yoshida, it's time to move on from PlayStation.

759
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:27,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So he headed up independent development at PlayStation for the past 30 years, and now is actually going to be leaving January 15th.

760
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:29,598
[SPEAKER_01]: of next year.

761
01:08:30,419 --> 01:08:33,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he's not retiring.

762
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,900
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be work.

763
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,202
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to still be working in the games industry in some capacity, but he's pretty much done.

764
01:08:40,362 --> 01:08:40,962
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so nice.

765
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:41,562
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done all he can do.

766
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:44,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine he'll do consultant type of work from here.

767
01:08:44,483 --> 01:08:51,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, I mean, maybe some sort of new operation, but I feel like this lends itself more to consultancy and that type of thing.

768
01:08:51,766 --> 01:08:53,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on the board of another company or something.

769
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,328
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what that means?

770
01:08:57,348 --> 01:08:57,708
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

771
01:08:58,629 --> 01:09:00,490
[SPEAKER_01]: The Amico's coming back, baby!

772
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

773
01:09:03,892 --> 01:09:20,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, obviously this guy's had a long career at Sony, and, you know, after the PlayStation 3... I wouldn't say the PlayStation 3 did bad, but obviously it had a very slow start, and, you know, had that recovery, but then it was really, you know, Yoshida that kind of led into the PlayStation 4 era...

774
01:09:21,421 --> 01:09:44,915
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know you mentioned he did a lot with you know kind of the smaller studios and you know indies and stuff and I think you really saw that really weaved into in a way uh you didn't see PlayStation 2 before with the PlayStation 4 you know and how readily available you know games on the store are and are very present in things like PlayStation Plus and the giveaways and so forth you know you definitely um see Yoshida's influence there so um

775
01:09:45,655 --> 01:10:10,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah obviously he he led Sony out of a difficult period into a period of much bigger successes and so um I think he leaves behind a company you know I don't know I know there's a lot of mixed things on PlayStation 5 and kind of especially when it comes to like the VR2 and some do we need to really need a PS5 Pro and some of this other stuff I'd like to kind of think that's a little more out of what he's probably directly dealing with a little more but

776
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:11,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope he enjoys his semi-retirement.

777
01:10:29,383 --> 01:10:32,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I say semi-retirement because I do think he shows up somewhere else.

778
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:39,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether he's consulting on a game or forms some sort of advocacy or publishing group maybe.

779
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:40,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

780
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can see him maybe taking it to a smaller scale.

781
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:46,953
[SPEAKER_02]: But I bet he would still be involved with helping indie games get to console.

782
01:10:47,413 --> 01:10:50,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see he could still have a very big career at that if he wants.

783
01:10:53,657 --> 01:10:53,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

784
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,481
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

785
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:38,982
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know a lot of League of Legends affiliated properties have been seeing success Arcane on Netflix obviously is the thing that comes to mind apparently season one of that show was incredible season two people are also loving I'm hearing season two it kind of starts slow but by the time it ends you're like fuck that was good but it's also very

786
01:11:39,802 --> 01:11:45,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also heard it's very much the last season, like they're not going to be doing a season three or anything else beyond this for Arcane.

787
01:11:45,403 --> 01:11:50,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still really big and getting eyes on, you know, that universe, the League of Legends universe.

788
01:11:51,124 --> 01:12:05,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, around this same sort of time, Riot has added some new things to the terms of service that can take action against players for behavior occurring, quote, "...across various places that touch their gaming experience."

789
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:11,451
[SPEAKER_02]: That can include penalties, suspensions, and even Riot-wide bans.

790
01:12:12,252 --> 01:12:20,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have until January 3rd of next year, so 2025, so you have about a month, to adjust your content to these new rules.

791
01:12:21,299 --> 01:12:26,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Riot Games is not going to proactively search social media for violations, but...

792
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:38,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Players can report cases about players badly behaving, say on a live stream where one of the games serves as the background of the content produced.

793
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:48,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And if Riot determines that the player is violating terms of service, Riot could issue a penalty as if that behavior occurred in the game.

794
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:49,410
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

795
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:32,903
[SPEAKER_02]: but the reality is when you have the banner of League of Legends behind you then what you say is reflective of the League of Legends community and if Riot doesn't want that to reflect on their game or their community they are under no obligation to let you continue to do that for free and that's the reality whether you like it or not

796
01:13:34,747 --> 01:13:38,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So behave yourselves and don't go openly cheating.

797
01:13:39,268 --> 01:13:45,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go being an asshole and don't be like playing League of Legends and then say, oh, I got matched with Loki.

798
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:47,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy sucks.

799
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's all go into Loki's chat and tell him how much he sucks.

800
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:56,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's behavior that could get you punished as it should.

801
01:13:57,512 --> 01:14:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: it is very reminiscent of Twitch changing this similar type of behavior you might remember during the opening ceremony at TwitchCon in Las Vegas you could get suspended or banned if you dox or swat other players even if you're not necessarily live when you do it so you're accountable for not being a shithead when you're doing things that could still represent the company that you are making money off of

802
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:30,414
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no such thing as freedom of speech when you're using a platform that gives you terms of service.

803
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:43,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Freedom of speech only has to deal with speaking about the government without having repercussions like jailing or fining from the government.

804
01:14:43,843 --> 01:14:54,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the flip side, you cannot brand your company the town hall or the bastion of free speech while you have a terms of service that actively works against that.

805
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:55,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

806
01:14:57,742 --> 01:14:58,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

807
01:14:58,342 --> 01:14:58,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

808
01:14:59,623 --> 01:15:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag deal with it.

809
01:15:00,483 --> 01:15:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

810
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:05,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go back to a simpler time before social media ruined everything.

811
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:15,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to take a look at not the classic game of the week, but once a month, DarkSakura takes a look at the canceled game of the month.

812
01:15:15,767 --> 01:15:17,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll that bumper.

813
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:20,449
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can find that bumper, roll that bumper.

814
01:15:20,469 --> 01:15:20,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

815
01:15:31,351 --> 01:15:52,557
[SPEAKER_06]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week but as previously mentioned DarkSakura likes to once a month check out a classic cancelled game of the week so what are we going to see this week DarkSakura?

816
01:15:54,118 --> 01:15:57,999
[SPEAKER_07]: what we are seeing this week is Primal Rage 2

817
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:13,365
[SPEAKER_07]: and yes, there have been releases of this that showed up in arcades as test units but we're going to go ahead and just take a little bit of step back on this one because for a while people thought this one was lost and gone so

818
01:16:16,787 --> 01:16:18,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I still have that cough.

819
01:16:19,688 --> 01:16:21,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a sequel to Primal Rage.

820
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:23,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It began its development in 1996.

821
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:31,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It was meant to be released in 1997, but it was cancelled a few months after Midway acquired Atari Games.

822
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:51,387
[SPEAKER_07]: there has only one known cabinet to exist and it is at last check at Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois and if any of our listeners are in or near that area if you would check that out and make sure that that's still good send us a picture

823
01:16:54,349 --> 01:17:03,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, the way the story for this goes is that the original characters were trapped and could not fight against each other directly.

824
01:17:03,592 --> 01:17:06,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have representatives amongst their human worshippers to fight.

825
01:17:07,894 --> 01:17:11,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have the ability to morph into their god's image.

826
01:17:11,936 --> 01:17:16,518
[SPEAKER_07]: There are new gods to make an appearance, like Slashfang, who is a

827
01:17:17,478 --> 01:17:29,132
[SPEAKER_07]: a fighter that takes the form of a dinophilus and Nekrosan, a dragon skeleton who was originally in the first game and was removed.

828
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:35,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So they never did get featured in any finished game, but there were toys made for them.

829
01:17:37,922 --> 01:17:54,087
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the story was, it was pretty close to the events that were in the first game, and revealed that the meteorite that struck Earth, as in URTH, was an egg holding the dragon beast Necrozon.

830
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,690
[SPEAKER_07]: who wanted to destroy the world.

831
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:05,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So to protect their world, they united against Necrozan, but they were defeated and imprisoned in half-suspended animation.

832
01:18:06,538 --> 01:18:12,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's when they reached out to the human avatars and then did things to fight.

833
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:18,729
[SPEAKER_07]: However, for some reason, Atari, I guess, wanted to keep that story going.

834
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:28,037
[SPEAKER_07]: So even after the game was canceled, they did a novel in 1997 called Primal Rage the Avatars.

835
01:18:28,598 --> 01:18:30,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It was written by John Warnholt.

836
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I may have to read this.

837
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:53,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So the characters were Kaze, who is an avatar of Blizzard, Tor for Armadon, Hina for Talon, Eric for Sauron, Shank for Chaos, Melissa for Vertigo, Sinjin for Diablo, Xiaoming for Slashfang, and then Necrozon.

838
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:56,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go.

839
01:18:56,996 --> 01:19:03,401
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an alpha build that was floating around the internet, but it had never been properly emulated.

840
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:05,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It would crash every time you selected a character.

841
01:19:07,805 --> 01:19:15,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And you needed a 558 megabyte CHD image that was supposed to go with it.

842
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:16,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

843
01:19:17,273 --> 01:19:18,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't really find that either.

844
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:27,595
[SPEAKER_07]: However, in March 2017, an individual made a modded version of MAME that was called MAME for Rage 2.

845
01:19:28,116 --> 01:19:29,916
[SPEAKER_07]: The numbers are numerical numbers.

846
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:33,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And were able to emulate it without any issues.

847
01:19:34,077 --> 01:19:35,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's out there.

848
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:42,379
[SPEAKER_07]: This was done by a user named Gruntzilla94.

849
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:53,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now, though the game is canceled, it still lives on in a preserved form out there for people to enjoy.

850
01:19:58,009 --> 01:19:59,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So canceled, but not really.

851
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's sort of that.

852
01:20:01,452 --> 01:20:02,192
[SPEAKER_02]: No, canceled.

853
01:20:02,272 --> 01:20:03,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, I know.

854
01:20:03,613 --> 01:20:04,454
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only alpha build.

855
01:20:04,714 --> 01:20:04,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

856
01:20:06,018 --> 01:20:34,713
[SPEAKER_07]: but apparently this emulation is fully functional yeah I was going to say it looks really good you know for it's time I mean it's a primal rage game but I thought that you know the concept behind it is neat I mean clearly people at Atari thought it was neat enough that they wrote a book about it yeah so yeah maybe we'll get a gold master series on it someday maybe they'll finish it who knows alright one can dream hey it's happened before that's true Star Fox 2

857
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:40,757
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, your classic canceled game of the week, Primal Rage 2.

858
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:45,240
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and that means that's December's game, right?

859
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:57,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, we should take a trip down memory lane and actually recap what the 12 selections were from this year for the theme, the canceled game of the month.

860
01:20:58,409 --> 01:21:00,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So the canceled game of the month, here we go.

861
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Trip down memory lane.

862
01:21:01,171 --> 01:21:03,933
[SPEAKER_02]: January was Capcom Fighting All-Stars.

863
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:15,635
[SPEAKER_02]: February was Thrill Kill March was Robotech Crystal Dreams April was Mega Man Universe May was Scalebound June was Penn & Teller's Smoke & Mirrors

864
01:21:21,773 --> 01:21:23,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one that you can mostly play through.

865
01:21:24,115 --> 01:21:26,557
[SPEAKER_02]: July was Dinosaur Planet, another dinosaur one.

866
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:28,038
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one I'm sad about.

867
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:31,121
[SPEAKER_02]: August was the one everybody's pissed about, StarCraft Ghost.

868
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

869
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:36,806
[SPEAKER_02]: September was Propeller Arena Aviation Battle Championship.

870
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:39,746
[SPEAKER_02]: October was Sonic Xtreme.

871
01:21:40,726 --> 01:21:43,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Last month was Sam and Max Freelance Police.

872
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there you have it rounding out the year.

873
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:48,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Primal Rage 2 for December.

874
01:21:48,349 --> 01:21:53,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check out the entire history of the Classic Game of the Week and cancelled games and all that.

875
01:21:54,971 --> 01:21:56,791
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wikia or Fandom now.

876
01:21:56,871 --> 01:22:00,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's orangeloungeradio.fandom.com is where the unofficial OLR Wiki is.

877
01:22:02,228 --> 01:22:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So are you ready for the honorable mentions?

878
01:22:07,252 --> 01:22:07,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sure.

879
01:22:07,732 --> 01:22:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear some honorable mentions.

880
01:22:09,794 --> 01:22:17,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did bring up Resident Evil 1.5 because that was a canceled version that eventually got remade into what we had as Resident Evil 2.

881
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:27,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Saints Row Undercover, Bio Force Ape, Liquid Kids, which does have an arcade version, and Rescue.

882
01:22:27,228 --> 01:22:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Rescue.

883
01:22:31,685 --> 01:22:32,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I need an idea.

884
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what I want to do next year.

885
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:37,731
[SPEAKER_02]: What should I do, people?

886
01:22:38,472 --> 01:22:39,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Send in those suggestions.

887
01:22:41,174 --> 01:22:41,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me now.

888
01:22:43,576 --> 01:22:43,917
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

889
01:22:44,457 --> 01:22:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on.

890
01:22:45,358 --> 01:22:51,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines that happened in the industry quickly.

891
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to it.

892
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:53,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

893
01:22:54,574 --> 01:23:05,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so No Man's Sky, after launching kind of broken and buggy, has finally now received a very positive rating on Steam.

894
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:19,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a very long time for, well, eight years, to essentially get all of the negative ratings outmatched by all the positive ones.

895
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:21,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they finally did it.

896
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:22,263
[SPEAKER_01]: They pulled it off.

897
01:23:23,857 --> 01:23:26,439
[SPEAKER_01]: No one thought it could happen, but it did.

898
01:23:38,001 --> 01:23:38,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a lot.

899
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:11,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we've got word now that 2K has ditched their PC launcher.

900
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:24,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So before, if you were launching games like Bioshock, the Bioshock Trilogy, The Quarry, Marvel's Midnight Sun, you'd have to launch them through the 2K launcher.

901
01:24:25,881 --> 01:24:28,042
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, you won't have to.

902
01:24:28,222 --> 01:24:29,903
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be able to launch them straight from Steam.

903
01:24:30,303 --> 01:24:33,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they updated that and it is not coming back.

904
01:24:34,995 --> 01:24:36,878
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

905
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:52,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, something that makes me happy.

906
01:24:52,773 --> 01:25:07,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Fantastic Nights Dreams Cotton, which I love, is coming to PS4 and Switch on November 28th due to Arcade Archive.

907
01:25:07,157 --> 01:25:10,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Unlike the $100 that I almost paid to get the PlayStation release.

908
01:25:10,658 --> 01:25:13,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the noise full-on came through on stream.

909
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:13,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

910
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:16,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I had them muted, but for some reason they still came up.

911
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:16,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

912
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:17,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to show the game.

913
01:25:19,176 --> 01:25:19,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

914
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:19,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

915
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:27,574
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, it is a shooter that was released by Success in 1991 where you play Cotton and you have

916
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:32,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Magic, bombs, and all kinds of things to destroy whatever is in your way.

917
01:25:33,005 --> 01:25:38,867
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a, as it says, it's a faithfully reproduced classic.

918
01:25:39,687 --> 01:25:50,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have your adjustable game difficulty, and it is available with menus and manuals in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

919
01:25:51,471 --> 01:25:53,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also just kind of hard.

920
01:25:53,491 --> 01:25:54,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a good game.

921
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:56,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

922
01:25:58,103 --> 01:26:05,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like kind of a difficult shooter game, but one of those where once you memorize the pattern, I'm sure it gets a little bit easier.

923
01:26:08,084 --> 01:26:10,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see, what do I have for y'all?

924
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:15,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about, oh, some new retro games that have come out for Nintendo Switch Online.

925
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:24,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You love to see some new games getting released, and the Game Boy Nintendo Switch Online, which I do not believe you need Pro for Game Boy.

926
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:27,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need Pro or whatever it's called, Expansion Pack, whatever the hell they call it.

927
01:26:27,952 --> 01:26:32,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need that for Game Boy Advance, but for original Game Boy, you get Donkey Kong Land 2.

928
01:26:33,174 --> 01:26:33,874
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

929
01:26:55,123 --> 01:27:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Vector Man, and ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, which was the sequel to the original ToeJam & Earl.

930
01:27:03,029 --> 01:27:03,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So, cute.

931
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,071
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that already has come out.

932
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:08,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available for you to check out.

933
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:13,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the same list, by the way, for both the US and Japan.

934
01:27:13,177 --> 01:27:14,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan has the same game.

935
01:27:14,578 --> 01:27:17,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's some minor differences, but not with that release.

936
01:27:18,461 --> 01:27:18,761
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

937
01:27:19,662 --> 01:27:23,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that you can...

938
01:27:25,151 --> 01:27:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out.

939
01:27:26,872 --> 01:27:27,233
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

940
01:27:28,293 --> 01:27:28,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

941
01:27:28,774 --> 01:27:47,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting off, we've got a lollipop chainsaw repop on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Animal Crossing Pocket Camp Complete on iOS and Android Anton Blast on PC and Nintendo Switch

942
01:27:48,149 --> 01:28:17,450

953
01:30:11,167 --> 01:30:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with, I think this one's a worldwide release, Fantasian Neo Dimension, finally coming off of the mobile devices exclusively and onto the Nintendo Switch this week in Japan as well.

954
01:30:24,112 --> 01:30:27,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an exclusive mobile device, I should point out.

955
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:28,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Apple Arcade.

956
01:30:29,013 --> 01:30:30,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, my bad.

957
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:39,303
[SPEAKER_02]: but I know they are doing some changes to it to make it controller friendly too because the original involved touchscreens operations if I'm not mistaken, right?

958
01:30:39,323 --> 01:30:43,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you like draw attack paths and stuff?

959
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:46,951
[SPEAKER_07]: My brain just blanked out.

960
01:30:46,991 --> 01:30:47,592
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you just say?

961
01:30:48,313 --> 01:30:50,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there touch mechanics in the original Fantasian?

962
01:30:52,624 --> 01:31:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played it on a mobile device, so I don't know I thought they made changes to it to make it, but I know they have made some changes to it just in regards to music mode and things like that that you usually see Oh, it was to arc your attacks, that was it, was what you were doing Okay, that's from Shane in our chatroom

963
01:31:15,023 --> 01:31:15,283
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

964

[SPEAKER_02]: We love robot dinosaur games.

971
01:31:46,219 --> 01:31:48,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Stella of the End is out in Japan this week.

972
01:31:49,242 --> 01:31:51,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And Care Bears to the Rescue.

973
01:31:52,185 --> 01:32:15,386
[SPEAKER_02]: which I had no idea there was a modern take on Care Bears but they look like the My Little Pony cartoon I don't know if that's the thing that's kind of the art style what it reminds me of um but that's cool the game actually looks cute I gotta say so this clearly was not I'm sure this game's been out here for a while but uh didn't cross my radar until I saw it on the Japanese releases so how about that on the PlayStation 5 a lot of similar releases as well

974
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:23,834
[SPEAKER_02]: including Fantasia, Neo Dimension, Under Defeat, also out in Japan, Pacific Drive in Japan, and that's it for the PlayStation 5.

978
01:33:13,564 --> 01:33:13,824
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

979
01:33:14,786 --> 01:33:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have just a few more stories for you, and then we'll invite your calls and other ways to participate with the show.

980
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:25,700
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to do that is through our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

981
01:33:26,441 --> 01:33:28,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we have a story from Loki.

982
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:34,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and another week and another set of litigious actions by Nintendo.

983
01:33:34,637 --> 01:33:49,853
[SPEAKER_01]: They are now continuing to go after some Switch pirates, mainly now following up on a case with the subreddit moderator, James Archbox Williams, who runs the

984
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:55,480
[SPEAKER_01]: aptly named and certainly under the radar SwitchPirates subreddit.

985
01:33:56,641 --> 01:34:01,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that's just people that love the Switch and act like pirates, right?

986
01:34:02,829 --> 01:34:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, they are trying to subpoena... Welcome to SwitchPirates, where it's talk like a pirate day every day.

987
01:34:07,395 --> 01:34:07,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Arr!

988
01:34:09,122 --> 01:34:21,594
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to subpoena a bunch of different online provider services to see if they can identify who some of these people are that are a part of this group.

989
01:34:21,694 --> 01:34:30,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are subpoenaing Reddit to try to get the user data for the folks, I guess, are posting on there.

990
01:34:31,184 --> 01:34:32,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really sure, but...

991
01:34:32,885 --> 01:34:40,731
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, you know, apparently they had a court case with Archbox, but he never showed.

992
01:34:41,591 --> 01:34:49,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's trying to evade, you know, the whole lawsuit, I guess, which is it's not going to happen.

993
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:59,024
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that, or that apparently right now they're trying to, though, you know, access the Google Drive and Gmail data.

994
01:34:59,504 --> 01:35:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: That was also involved with that.

995
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:08,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they were hosting some of these on Google Drives, like the files and stuff, but that's probably it.

996
01:35:08,887 --> 01:35:16,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, Discord as well to try to get access to the Discord to find out, you know...

997
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:28,426
[SPEAKER_01]: they find these other multiple other actors who appear to have a role in the pirate shops they were selling you know the pirated games or means to pirate these games

998
01:35:30,379 --> 01:35:31,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well good luck, I guess.

999
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Go and squirt Shirt on everybody.

1000
01:35:33,701 --> 01:35:34,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

1001
01:35:34,622 --> 01:35:38,744
[SPEAKER_02]: They're definitely trying to get as many people as they can.

1002
01:35:39,005 --> 01:35:41,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're trying to scare people off of this Reddit, too.

1003
01:35:41,626 --> 01:35:44,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 200,000 people following it is quite a lot of people.

1004
01:35:44,368 --> 01:35:48,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a little, like, it's just gonna push it more underground is what it's gonna do.

1005
01:35:48,271 --> 01:35:57,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, like, I mean, yeah, it is kind of bold to be out there, like, hey, look, we're pirating all this stuff, actively shouting to the heavens, hey, look, we're stealing all this.

1006
01:35:57,977 --> 01:35:58,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Like,

1007
01:36:01,329 --> 01:36:07,533
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that you're not going to get caught, you're just actively being out there.

1008
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Those lost don't reply to you, which is usually what it is.

1009
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:14,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.

1010
01:36:16,218 --> 01:36:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Hecht and Chat suggest maybe they were just stealing light switches.

1011
01:36:20,325 --> 01:36:27,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they were Zelda themed light switches or some of the other familiar names you might see on that Reddit.

1012
01:36:30,554 --> 01:36:33,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the light switch installed so you could turn the lights on and off.

1013
01:36:34,017 --> 01:36:35,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so you could have a light switch rave.

1014
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't help but think about that.

1015
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:40,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, moving on to one more story.

1016
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:47,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're talking about litigious Nintendo, of course, we have to talk about PAL World, which is getting a pretty big update.

1017
01:36:47,392 --> 01:36:50,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is interesting because they announced the update this week.

1018
01:36:50,533 --> 01:36:52,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And my understanding is that the update did go live.

1019
01:36:53,394 --> 01:36:57,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people that are really into the game do not like the changes this update made.

1020
01:36:58,195 --> 01:37:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people suspect that this update was trying to change some of the things that Nintendo is trying to litigate.

1021
01:37:04,176 --> 01:37:14,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as, I guess one thing is that when you spawn your not legally distinct Pokemon, when you spawn your legally distinct Pokemon, you no longer like, I guess, throw a ball.

1022
01:37:14,743 --> 01:37:18,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember, I played the game for a hot minute when it first, first came out.

1023
01:37:18,145 --> 01:37:19,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, all right, whatever, I'm done.

1024
01:37:20,266 --> 01:37:21,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved on to the next thing.

1025
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:28,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you don't throw a ball or you don't choose where the legally distinct Pokemon can spawn anymore.

1026
01:37:28,652 --> 01:37:30,293
[SPEAKER_02]: They always spawn next to you.

1027
01:37:31,033 --> 01:37:54,041
[SPEAKER_02]: and some people are saying that that is to try to get around some sort of thing that Nintendo is suing them basically like you're throwing a Pokeball and the Pokemon comes out they're trying to get around that but people don't like that because you can't strategically place the legally distinct Pokemon anymore so interesting how this is all going down but the new update is also supposed to feature new pals is what they call them

1028
01:37:55,031 --> 01:38:00,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Traitors to fight against, bosses, and a high difficulty challenge for fans of the original.

1029
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:17,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, folks not really a fan of some of these updates that have changed some of the core mechanics, but possibly, we don't know for sure, but possibly to try to change some things ahead of Nintendo coming after them in court.

1030
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:41,240
[SPEAKER_02]: uh also announced uh you know PAL World doesn't exist in a bubble we know Sony has supported them we know they're on Microsoft platforms they're just not on Nintendo platforms they're going to be having a crossover with the game Terraria which I haven't heard about this game in a while but Terraria of course is that game it's like 2D Minecraft I guess is the lazy way to describe it yeah it's like a sandbox 2D sandbox game 2D sandbox game

1031
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,242
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1032
01:39:05,294 --> 01:39:10,916
[SPEAKER_02]: When all is said and done with the Nintendo litigation, the game's not dead.

1033
01:39:11,556 --> 01:39:18,538
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot going on, and clearly the game has, even though it's not the... Sorry, I don't know how to turn that off.

1034
01:39:19,558 --> 01:39:21,559
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the follow alert for my personal channel.

1035
01:39:21,579 --> 01:39:23,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to turn it off.

1036
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:24,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But what was I going to say about...

1037
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:28,162
[SPEAKER_02]: That threw me off, dang it.

1038
01:39:28,282 --> 01:39:39,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was going to say, even though this isn't like the number one broadcasted game on Steam, or I'm sorry, the number one played game on Steam, like it was the week it launched, it's kind of like Pokemon Go.

1039
01:39:39,566 --> 01:39:45,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gigantic for those first few weeks, and then it kind of fell off, but it's still there, and there's still quite a few people to play it.

1040
01:39:45,748 --> 01:39:47,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like where Power World is at, ironically.

1041
01:39:48,109 --> 01:39:50,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I just compared Power World to Pokemon again.

1042
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:51,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, me.

1043
01:39:52,851 --> 01:39:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1044
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:58,563
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's it for all the slotted stories we had tonight.

1045
01:39:59,183 --> 01:40:02,666
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to encourage you all to participate with our listener roundtable.

1046
01:40:02,806 --> 01:40:06,749
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to give us a call, you sure can over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1047
01:40:07,149 --> 01:40:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also send us a message on Blue Sky.

1048
01:40:09,431 --> 01:40:10,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have anything this week.

1049
01:40:11,052 --> 01:40:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to promote DarkSakura's little Friday stream, and I asked a question, but nobody responded.

1050
01:40:16,776 --> 01:40:20,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess people are out of town doing better things on Friday, so whatever.

1051
01:40:20,799 --> 01:40:23,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can follow us on BlueSky at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1052
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:27,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, your.com can be your handle on Blue Sky.

1053
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:32,185
[SPEAKER_02]: That is still a concept people are getting used to because everybody's like, where's my blue checkmark?

1054
01:40:32,285 --> 01:40:34,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, well, no, they did this instead.

1055
01:40:35,406 --> 01:40:40,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But people don't understand yet that you can actually have your domain be your Blue Sky name.

1056
01:40:41,069 --> 01:41:02,941
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is in case Blue Sky ever goes away or gets bought by a billionaire masquerading as a supervillain you could just move everything via the app protocol which is the backbone that Blue Sky is built on you move everything from that to another service and so that's why essentially like my personal is robroberts.bsky.com

1057
01:41:05,557 --> 01:41:08,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, robroberts.bsky.com or whatever everybody has, right?

1058
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,481
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually just like its own domain.

1059
01:41:11,001 --> 01:41:13,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like DarkSakura has one, just like Loki has one, it's its own domain.

1060
01:41:14,323 --> 01:41:24,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I wanted to move it to a Mr. Rob Roberts, you know, whatever I decided to buy.com of my own, or even I could even do a rob.vognetwork.com if I really wanted to.

1061
01:41:25,491 --> 01:41:27,733
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also kind of noticed that like,

1062
01:41:28,829 --> 01:41:36,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Since people haven't really gotten used to that concept yet, I think it's actually more advantageous to keep the generic .bsky.com, right?

1063
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:40,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Or .bsky.team, whatever it is, to keep that as the default right now.

1064
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:44,862
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also take your emails, as always.

1065
01:41:44,942 --> 01:41:47,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Participate at orangelauntrader.com.

1066
01:41:47,324 --> 01:41:49,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we got any of those either, unless I'm wrong.

1067
01:41:50,126 --> 01:41:50,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1068
01:41:50,767 --> 01:41:51,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think so.

1069
01:41:52,088 --> 01:41:54,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So we take questions from chat, if you'd like.

1070
01:41:55,337 --> 01:42:00,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go to DJ Ranma S who says, Can we talk about how positive people are on Blue Sky?

1071
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:04,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not expecting so many people commenting on my post about my interview.

1072
01:42:05,141 --> 01:42:07,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike Deft follows that up saying, Blue Sky is really nice.

1073
01:42:08,302 --> 01:42:10,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it stays like that for a long while.

1074
01:42:11,104 --> 01:42:12,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you my take on this.

1075
01:42:12,624 --> 01:42:13,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a happy place.

1076
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you why this is.

1077
01:42:15,545 --> 01:42:21,528
[SPEAKER_02]: That is because a lot of the people on Twitter are actually bots and foreign assets.

1078
01:42:22,368 --> 01:42:29,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and this is that, I think this open secret, I think a lot of people know, and I know y'all are going to be like, Rob's got the tinfoil hat on again.

1079
01:42:30,098 --> 01:42:33,442
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I, I, I, I think there's a fair amount of confidence.

1080
01:42:33,462 --> 01:42:34,083
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's accurate.

1081
01:42:34,103 --> 01:42:38,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That people posting on X, I guess we should call it because Twitter died.

1082
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:39,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we call it?

1083
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1084
01:42:40,311 --> 01:42:40,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1085
01:42:41,452 --> 01:42:45,817
[SPEAKER_02]: The people posting on X are not quote-unquote real people.

1086
01:42:46,138 --> 01:42:49,982
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be real people, but they are paid to have an agenda when they post.

1087
01:42:50,062 --> 01:42:52,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they are AI, they are bots, they're chat GBT.

1088
01:42:53,186 --> 01:42:55,709
[SPEAKER_07]: That segment has- I hate little fuckers on there too.

1089
01:42:56,109 --> 01:42:57,590
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1090
01:43:17,256 --> 01:43:44,037
[SPEAKER_02]: community-based moderation tools are very strong and I feel like the real deal breaker for a lot of people when it came to X was the change in blocking was that once it's like you block somebody and it does nothing on X now right essentially they can't reply to you is all it is right so that's what they did over there on Blue Sky when you block somebody they they fucking vanished in the middle they you raptured them the fuck off your internet when you block them

1091
01:43:45,049 --> 01:44:10,740
[SPEAKER_02]: you and that's that's both ways you can't go look at their profile anymore any bleats whatever you want to call them skeets whatever I hate that name but whatever you want to call them whatever they try to put like if somebody tries to quote tweet dunk on them and you're that will not push will not show you'll never know that person fucking vaporized in the middle of the night that's what the block button does on blue sky and so what people do they curate these lists

1092
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are all of the robots of Blue Sky.

1093
01:44:14,361 --> 01:44:18,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Subscribe to this list and you will automatically block people as they are added to this list.

1094
01:44:19,544 --> 01:44:34,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I caution people tremendously from going overboard with that because some people, you know, you have to really trust the person making that list to get it right 100% of the time.

1095
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:39,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, if they get it wrong, that person will be mega blocked for you.

1096
01:44:40,453 --> 01:44:49,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a mute list may be a safer way to not, because you can still mute people and not vaporize them, essentially, from your internet.

1097
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:53,424
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't see much from them, but you can get it back.

1098
01:44:53,724 --> 01:44:54,945
[SPEAKER_02]: You can save that relationship.

1099
01:44:55,525 --> 01:45:01,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people also don't know, there is a, your blocks on Blue Sky, public.

1100
01:45:02,287 --> 01:45:07,589
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to a website called clearsky.app, put in your handle, and it'll show you exactly who blocked you.

1101
01:45:07,929 --> 01:45:08,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't tell you why.

1102
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality, I'm going to tell you that.

1103
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:15,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to go, all of you on Blue Sky are going to go look, and you're going to see that somebody blocked you.

1104
01:45:16,452 --> 01:45:19,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably going to frustrate you because you're going to be like, why did I get blocked?

1105
01:45:20,373 --> 01:45:21,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is...

1106
01:45:21,994 --> 01:45:29,516
[SPEAKER_02]: People block for the dumbest shit sometimes, and that's just a fact of life or whatever they had to do to keep their peace.

1107
01:45:29,936 --> 01:45:44,781
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, I wrote a thing where I was critical of Chapel Roan's post on TikTok where she was mispronouncing the vice president's name, and I had some personal thoughts on that that I felt was not a good look for her.

1108
01:45:45,601 --> 01:45:48,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still don't think it was, but that's neither here nor there.

1109
01:45:48,602 --> 01:45:50,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many Chapel Roan fans blocked me that day?

1110
01:45:51,567 --> 01:46:12,988
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't give a fuck like if that's gonna be a deal breaker for you I'm a pretty awesome person and if you know I offended your delicate sensibilities by just posting what was I believe to be some common sense then bye Felicia I don't care so that's my thing is that if you're gonna go look at your blocks don't get your feelings hurt when you see you've been blocked

1111
01:46:15,131 --> 01:46:16,472
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I love Chaperone.

1112
01:46:16,952 --> 01:46:17,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I love her as an artist.

1113
01:46:17,933 --> 01:46:18,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I love her music.

1114
01:46:19,113 --> 01:46:22,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But people on the internet don't fucking know nuance anymore.

1115
01:46:23,676 --> 01:46:28,219
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not willing to see the deeper side of something, and you just have to kind of get used to that.

1116
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:30,401
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to block you for whatever reason they feel like.

1117
01:46:32,702 --> 01:46:33,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair miss.

1118
01:46:33,482 --> 01:46:34,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1119
01:46:34,563 --> 01:46:36,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my particular... I'm like, they're missing out.

1120
01:46:37,045 --> 01:46:37,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty neat.

1121
01:46:38,586 --> 01:46:38,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1122
01:46:39,656 --> 01:46:44,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, PodCulture says, wow, that ClearSky's, uh-oh, now I've opened a door to a lot of people.

1123
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can see exactly who's blocked you, what lists you're on.

1124
01:46:49,325 --> 01:46:51,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll show you all that stuff is public.

1125
01:46:51,327 --> 01:46:52,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can you see that?

1126
01:46:52,888 --> 01:46:54,109
[SPEAKER_02]: ClearSky.app.

1127
01:46:54,249 --> 01:46:54,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it .app or .com?

1128
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, ClearSky.

1129
01:46:56,371 --> 01:47:03,375
[SPEAKER_02]: ClearSky, C-L-E-A-R-S-K-Y is the name of that, and you can see all of that.

1130
01:47:03,795 --> 01:47:06,216
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO100Matt says, wow, somebody actually blocked me.

1131
01:47:06,396 --> 01:47:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably someone who hates my dog.

1132
01:47:08,037 --> 01:47:10,258
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture says... That's not even loading up for me.

1133
01:47:11,319 --> 01:47:13,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very... Just word of caution.

1134
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:17,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously a lot of people are slamming that site with Blue Sky's explosive growth.

1135
01:47:17,782 --> 01:47:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has a tendency to go up and down.

1136
01:47:22,145 --> 01:47:22,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1137
01:47:24,061 --> 01:47:49,395
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and there are people there you will also find there are people on blue sky that will just try to block as many people as they possibly can so you may have shown up on because somebody's just trying to block you could go to their profile and see who else they've blocked you'll probably see if they've blocked a thousand people whatever it's just you know well no one's blocked me I've blocked a bunch of people

1138
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, some people having, they're all assholes.

1139
01:47:55,193 --> 01:47:55,813
[SPEAKER_02]: They're missing out.

1140
01:47:55,833 --> 01:47:56,673
[SPEAKER_02]: They're missing out.

1141
01:47:57,174 --> 01:47:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1142
01:47:58,814 --> 01:48:02,216
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says, I noticed two people I can't stand have me blocked.

1143
01:48:02,396 --> 01:48:02,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad.

1144
01:48:05,277 --> 01:48:08,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It says something a little more explicit and then I can have my peace.

1145
01:48:09,559 --> 01:48:11,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Right says, nobody blocked me yet somehow.

1146
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:16,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Right, you post wholesome content of old gaming ads and old video games.

1147
01:48:17,163 --> 01:48:18,683
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare anyone block that?

1148
01:48:18,983 --> 01:48:20,084
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare anyone block that?

1149
01:48:20,684 --> 01:48:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one person and I don't know who they are but that's all right who cares they're probably somebody who just somebody who hates Minecraft somebody who whenever they see a Minecraft image comes up goes I can't stand this oh my god what's funny is that there's a someone who I actually literally have not thought about that blocked me like I'm still living rent-free in their head that's always kind of fun to see too I had somebody like that oh it's Tay by the way oh

1150
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:57,384
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway I don't know if I can say it Mike Def says if anything you should be on a retro gaming list to Orange Rite a retro gaming list so

1151
01:48:58,757 --> 01:48:59,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1152
01:48:59,778 --> 01:49:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1153
01:49:00,039 --> 01:49:04,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now I guess I've expanded everybody's minds with a new tool they can use, but it's also a good lesson.

1154
01:49:04,744 --> 01:49:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff, you know, and some people don't like that about Blue Sky and say, I should have a right to my privacy in that regard on who I block.

1155
01:49:12,132 --> 01:49:16,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, right now, it's not the protocol that that whole thing was built on.

1156
01:49:16,437 --> 01:49:19,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember, Blue Sky was not

1157
01:49:19,861 --> 01:49:20,502
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1158
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:50,152
[SPEAKER_02]: where the tweets and the posts are decentralized so they live in a place where they cannot be censored.

1159
01:49:50,452 --> 01:49:57,278
[SPEAKER_02]: The government cannot come in and tell people what they can and can't say because this exists in a cloud state.

1160
01:49:57,358 --> 01:50:01,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It exists on a protocol and it does not belong to any one organization.

1161
01:50:01,542 --> 01:50:04,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Sky is simply a lens through which you're looking at app protocol.

1162
01:50:06,536 --> 01:50:31,655
[SPEAKER_02]: and so there is that openness to it because it has to be highly portable in that regard so that Blue Sky ever does go down but that doesn't you know again people are just thinking like I just want a Twitter replacement why can't I have pictures and DMs I just want something that replaces Twitter because Blue Sky wasn't actually built to be that but it just turns out that now people realize wow when you take the fucking billionaires out of social media and there's no apps and

1163
01:50:32,095 --> 01:50:34,898
[SPEAKER_02]: and all this control over the algorithm is in your hands.

1164
01:50:35,278 --> 01:50:38,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Social media is kind of fucking awesome.

1165
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Blue Sky is expanding as fast as it is right now.

1166
01:50:42,545 --> 01:50:45,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed you haven't been served any ads on Blue Sky?

1167
01:50:47,669 --> 01:50:48,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.

1168
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:48,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.

1169
01:50:50,612 --> 01:50:50,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1170
01:50:52,438 --> 01:50:57,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OrangeRite says, I did follow a retro game starter pack and I got a bunch of follows from that.

1171
01:50:57,859 --> 01:51:00,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm surprised how much the starter pack thing took off.

1172
01:51:00,999 --> 01:51:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a Gamer, G-A-Y-M-E-R starter pack.

1173
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:05,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of new people from that.

1174
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thankful to the folks that put me on that.

1175
01:51:08,481 --> 01:51:08,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1176
01:51:09,601 --> 01:51:11,121
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was almost a little overwhelmed.

1177
01:51:11,141 --> 01:51:15,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm telling you, in the scope of two days, I had hundreds of new followers because of that starter pack.

1178
01:51:15,982 --> 01:51:18,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just surprised that starter packs are that popular.

1179
01:51:18,502 --> 01:51:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess, you know, when you're coming over from a platform and you don't know...

1180
01:51:22,243 --> 01:51:26,667
[SPEAKER_02]: for all the people that are like, I don't get engagement on Blue Sky.

1181
01:51:26,747 --> 01:51:28,408
[SPEAKER_02]: No one responds to anything I write.

1182
01:51:28,488 --> 01:51:32,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how many people are you following and interacting with?

1183
01:51:32,472 --> 01:51:34,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So starter packs do make a good place to start.

1184
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:37,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say it's something like a video game.

1185
01:51:37,275 --> 01:51:40,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we'll take Orange Rite's Retro Game Starter Pack.

1186
01:51:40,878 --> 01:51:43,861
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk about retro games on Blue Sky, here's a great place to start.

1187
01:51:43,921 --> 01:51:46,343
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are highly likely to talk about retro games with you.

1188
01:51:46,963 --> 01:51:47,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And that part's pretty cool.

1189
01:51:48,604 --> 01:51:49,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

1190
01:51:49,985 --> 01:51:55,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, QuestBuster says, every time I check into Blue Sky, I'm greeted with cats and food pictures, which is nice.

1191
01:51:56,029 --> 01:51:56,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1192
01:51:56,549 --> 01:51:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, there's custom algorithm.

1193
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:03,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's a custom algorithm for nothing but food pictures, but there definitely is one for nothing but cats.

1194
01:52:03,754 --> 01:52:13,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if, you know, there's, there's another slang term for a cat that sometimes is also a slang term for a piece of anatomy.

1195
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:14,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1196
01:52:15,967 --> 01:52:20,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of those pictures sneak in there, but I don't think so.

1197
01:52:20,472 --> 01:52:24,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's only scanning for cat, kitten, and things like that.

1198
01:52:24,136 --> 01:52:27,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't get confused with the other word.

1199
01:52:28,021 --> 01:52:29,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the custom algorithms are huge.

1200
01:52:30,404 --> 01:52:32,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting now is that threads...

1201
01:52:33,587 --> 01:52:35,648
[SPEAKER_02]: is now... Competition works, y'all.

1202
01:52:35,989 --> 01:52:48,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Threads is now looking at... I think Threads implemented custom feeds and Threads is now looking at having a chronological feed be your default feed even though that is against everything Instagram and Facebook want.

1203
01:52:49,597 --> 01:52:53,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is they are losing people to blue sky, hemorrhaging people to blue sky because of it.

1204
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they don't allow people to control your feed...

1205
01:52:58,612 --> 01:52:58,952
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1206
01:52:59,472 --> 01:52:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1207
01:53:00,373 --> 01:53:03,554
[SPEAKER_02]: FifthDream says, cat pics does have a lot of furries.

1208
01:53:04,294 --> 01:53:04,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

1209
01:53:04,674 --> 01:53:05,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see how that happens.

1210
01:53:06,155 --> 01:53:08,976
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people in their cat suits and things like that.

1211
01:53:09,056 --> 01:53:09,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep.

1212
01:53:09,556 --> 01:53:10,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.

1213
01:53:11,977 --> 01:53:13,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out who was the block mate.

1214
01:53:14,118 --> 01:53:15,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It was somebody that I blocked.

1215
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:21,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on one of those large block lists for... No one lost.

1216
01:53:21,581 --> 01:53:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly, right?

1217
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:26,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably went through their list and were like, well, fuck him and fuck him and fuck him.

1218
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:27,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1219
01:53:27,443 --> 01:53:28,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1220
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:31,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

1221
01:53:33,081 --> 01:53:33,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.

1222
01:53:34,242 --> 01:53:41,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So real quick, apparently Crackdown 1 and 2 are free on Xbox Live in case you never did redeem them.

1223
01:53:42,146 --> 01:53:42,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know that.

1224
01:53:42,826 --> 01:53:43,226
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1225
01:53:44,067 --> 01:53:49,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So go redeem those now to your account if you don't have them already.

1226
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:52,171
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, they are pretty old because they're from the Xbox 360.

1227
01:53:52,691 --> 01:53:53,231
[SPEAKER_01]: One was good.

1228
01:53:53,692 --> 01:53:55,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Two was alright.

1229
01:53:55,753 --> 01:53:58,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Three is not as great.

1230
01:53:58,953 --> 01:54:00,555
[SPEAKER_01]: but the first one was good.

1231
01:54:00,975 --> 01:54:02,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the first couple games were great.

1232
01:54:03,859 --> 01:54:04,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that.

1233
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:05,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Love a free game.

1234
01:54:07,162 --> 01:54:07,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

1235
01:54:10,046 --> 01:54:10,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else, Loki?

1236
01:54:10,626 --> 01:54:11,167
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I had.

1237
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:15,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess with that then, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.

1238
01:54:15,602 --> 01:54:20,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad, I mean, a little shorter of a show, but not that short considering it was holiday week and all.

1239
01:54:20,344 --> 01:54:22,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you all had a great holiday week, by the way.

1240
01:54:22,505 --> 01:54:24,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry most of you are going back to work tomorrow.

1241
01:54:24,426 --> 01:54:26,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I am too, but we'll get through it together.

1242
01:54:26,687 --> 01:54:29,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just a few weeks away from the other holiday season.

1243
01:54:29,668 --> 01:54:32,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be coming up on the new year before you know it.

01:55:07,174 --> 01:55:14,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've decided that I'm going to limit my Dead by Daylight to just two days a week just so I can keep a few more positive and chill vibes around.

1251
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:20,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I still enjoy playing it, but I don't know.

1252
01:55:21,284 --> 01:55:22,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to have a little bit of a break for right now.

1253
01:55:22,985 --> 01:55:28,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to play Polya tonight, and I just want to hang around and just have people hang out and chat about stuff we talked about on the show.

1254
01:55:29,574 --> 01:55:31,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety is good, so enjoy.

1255
01:55:31,376 --> 01:55:31,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good stream.

1256
01:55:32,216 --> 01:55:40,583
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had to mute for a moment because I literally did laugh my ass off over living rent-free and that fucker's head.

1257
01:55:41,464 --> 01:55:42,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good stream.

1258
01:55:43,266 --> 01:55:43,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1259
01:55:43,806 --> 01:55:45,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I am spiteful and I love it.

1260
01:55:45,728 --> 01:55:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1261
01:55:46,188 --> 01:55:47,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good one.

1262
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:48,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, taters.

1263
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.

1264
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, we're gonna go to you to do your final thought.

1265
01:55:54,155 --> 01:55:57,858
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is still gonna be working hard on Minecraft stuff this week.

1266
01:55:59,153 --> 01:56:00,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

1267
01:56:00,153 --> 01:56:00,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep at it.

1268
01:56:00,734 --> 01:56:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep at it.

1269
01:56:02,214 --> 01:56:06,375
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I can't believe it's already December and the end of the year is almost here.

1270
01:56:06,695 --> 01:56:09,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a heck of an interesting year.

1271
01:56:09,736 --> 01:56:10,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good stuff.

1272
01:56:10,637 --> 01:56:12,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything's been great, but lots of good stuff.

1273
01:56:13,658 --> 01:56:16,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's to 2025 on the horizon.

1274
01:56:16,979 --> 01:56:20,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave you with something real, a real piece of advice here.

1275
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wait until New Year's Day

1276
01:56:24,801 --> 01:56:25,581
[SPEAKER_02]: to do something.

1277
01:56:26,081 --> 01:56:29,482
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make a change in your life, you want to start doing something, do it now.

1278
01:56:29,963 --> 01:56:30,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it now.

1279
01:56:30,523 --> 01:56:32,163
[SPEAKER_02]: January 1st is just today.

1280
01:56:32,683 --> 01:56:33,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another day.

1281
01:56:34,544 --> 01:56:41,206
[SPEAKER_02]: As that song goes, since DarkSakura brought up rent, I'll say a line from the musical, which I actually don't like.

1282
01:56:41,846 --> 01:56:42,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The musical rent.

1283
01:56:42,927 --> 01:56:45,047
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a quote from there that always sticks with me.

1284
01:56:45,748 --> 01:56:46,628
[SPEAKER_02]: No day but today.

1285
01:56:47,088 --> 01:56:49,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So make those changes you want to make today.

1286
01:56:49,549 --> 01:56:49,789
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1287
01:56:49,889 --> 01:56:50,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, everybody.

1288
01:56:50,669 --> 01:56:52,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1289
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:53,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.
