1
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,636
[SPEAKER_06]: InTheGroove rips off Dance Dance Revolution, adds 3D and zany mods, makes a splash.

2
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:16,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Genshin Impact rips off Zelda, adds gacha, becomes a huge hit.

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Power World rips off Pokemon, adds guns, becomes the next lightning in a bottle.

4
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:26,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Derivative Works and merging two hit formulas together to make a new one is not an uncommon act, but makes for a legal headache and an unending gamer debate.

5
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still avoiding talking about layoffs.

6
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:35,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to talk about these and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,229 --> 00:01:06,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight January the 28th 2024 for the 991st time that's right episode 991 of our program live since 2002 uh if you can believe it or not talking about video games the gaming industry the gamer lifestyle gaming culture

8
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:11,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, even when sometimes the news isn't so good, which I feel like it is this week.

9
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:18,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just saying earlier, it's it's hard to be a gaming enthusiast show when you're not always feeling enthusiastic about the industry.

10
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:25,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think those of you that follow the news even very lightly probably have a very good idea what I'm referencing.

11
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:26,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that in a moment.

12
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I'm always enthusiastic to say hello to my co-host.

13
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:31,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of welcoming back last week.

14
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:34,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DarkSakura was here for part of the show, but hi DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:41,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, and I hope you're feeling better this week.

16
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:42,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling much better.

17
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:52,920
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the my ability to actually eat food returned a few days ago, and I made myself a delightful lamb dish from scratch.

18
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:07,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Bojolet, my favorite red wine, cranberries, multicolored baby carrots, herbs from my

19
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm pretty sure I saw I'm pretty sure I saw a blue sky post at some point over the weekend where you were you were kind of you were you were wine drinking and you were saying I gotta like I don't know it was something like I got a wine buzz going or something something that I forgot the exact verbage.

20
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dan, Dan was asking if I was going to be if I was streaming.

21
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:30,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, I'm streaming at 830 right now.

22
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:31,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's drunk 30.

23
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:32,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

24
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,455
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

25
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:34,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It's drunk 30.

26
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

27
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:35,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Drunk 30.

28
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

29
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And

30
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:42,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And it you know, the wine was good and I have zero regrets.

31
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

32
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:46,675
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're drinking responsibly, you shouldn't have any regrets.

33
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:47,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you do.

34
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: No red wine headaches when it's a good red wine.

35
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

36
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:53,263
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

37
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:54,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also say hello.

38
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:57,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enthusiastic to welcome back this week.

39
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how are you doing, Loki?

40
00:02:59,049 --> 00:02:59,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing good.

41
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,608
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you were off last week because the kiddo's birthday.

42
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,429
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S was here.

43
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:11,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that you could ever be replaced, but Ranma did a great job in your absence, especially when he ended up having to do a two chair show with me for half the show.

44
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So big thanks to our pal Ranma for being here last week.

45
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:17,234
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's fantastic to have you back.

46
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:19,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And how was the kiddo's birthday?

47
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:19,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

48
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:25,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I know sometimes you do like golf land or like some of these things that we used to do in the past.

49
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

50
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,603
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't really want to do anything like that.

51
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:38,313
[SPEAKER_07]: We offered to do a birthday party with his friends and stuff, but he just wanted to go eat at the Olive Garden and then...

52
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:43,258
[SPEAKER_07]: We also hung out with... A man with taste!

53
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,279
[SPEAKER_03]: A little young man with taste!

54
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,960
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes the breadsticks, you know what I'm gonna say.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Who fucking doesn't?

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:57,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, it's... So we did that, and yeah, I mean, he got his usual gifts that he asked for.

57
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of interesting.

58
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:05,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, he does all the Robux stuff, so usually gets a lot of Robux.

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:14,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he got some Steam cards and my wife got him some fidget, like, stress balls is what he wanted.

60
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So he has like 30 of those now.

61
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:19,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

62
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this your younger?

63
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:24,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I need one the size of my cubicle, please.

64
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, actually legit, I love those little stress pop things.

65
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: But funny enough, I don't have one.

66
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,344
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll be sitting there in a Target.

67
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:38,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I don't know about you all, but like I have this really weird ritual when we go to Target is that we always go look at the video game section.

68
00:04:38,909 --> 00:05:06,813
[SPEAKER_03]: even when we're like we're not gonna buy anything and like I know I have this fucking podcast I know what games are coming out well we still we always go look Alan and I have to look we walk up and down the aisles but lately it's well number one those aisles have been getting smaller and smaller which is kind of depressing yeah they um they've like it's weird they like at first I thought they removed all of their video games but they just removed the cover art for their video games and they have it like still locked up but there's like hardly any

69
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:12,286
[SPEAKER_07]: physical media there right now.

70
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:19,093
[SPEAKER_07]: They have it there, but you have to really peer in the case to see what's actually there.

71
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:21,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird.

72
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:28,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what that's all about, if it's just that they're not giving them good margins anymore, and so it's like, well, we're just not going to carry this.

73
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:43,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason I brought it up is that last time we were there, we floated to the video game section and then like across from that or behind it, they have like the pop culture stuff, like all the pop vinyls and that, you know, the horror dolls and all that stuff.

74
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:45,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had a little pop thing.

75
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:48,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just started sitting there going pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

76
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:51,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, literally, I'm in my own little world.

77
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Alan is like, where did you go?

78
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:56,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I started walking down the aisles looking.

79
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get you one the size of your head.

80
00:05:58,924 --> 00:05:59,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

81
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:00,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love it.

82
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:05,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I still need to give you your presents, too, because I actually found something else to add to it and now I have to find where I put it.

83
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

84
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

85
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:14,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, speaking of Target, the other reason to look at Target is they do have random ass video game knickknacks sometimes.

86
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:18,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this is true of any department store, but like the baby arcade one-up Ms.

87
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man that sits behind me on the stream where we tape live.

88
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:40,970
[SPEAKER_03]: as we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show and you can see things behind me like my little baby arcade one-up miss pac-man machine oops sorry that I got from Tarjay uh so they get random ass knickknacks sometimes that are pretty cool believe it or not so

89
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:54,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so Loki, you weren't here last week, but I see I see this whole pal world stuff has obviously made its way to your house with because I can see it in the background there.

90
00:06:54,164 --> 00:07:00,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I have you gotten on the power world bandwagon or you know, I haven't played it yet.

91
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,531
[SPEAKER_03]: It's um,

92
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:03,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something we'll talk about later.

93
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's interesting how huge that game keeps getting and how huge the target is getting as a result.

94
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of targets, but in a different way.

95
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll talk, we'll talk all about that a little bit.

96
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:21,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, we're going to start off tonight with some news that isn't fun.

97
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:33,565
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is the this is the crappiest part of talking about the news every week because this is a story that won't go away and it's getting really, really

98
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard.

99
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's it's been hard every time, but it's like it's it's right.

100
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,067
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not stopping.

101
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting worse.

102
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's unexpected, though.

103
00:07:43,808 --> 00:08:00,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, honestly, I mean, because so the story we have, of course, is Activision Blizzard have or Microsoft with their purchase of Activision Blizzard have laid off nearly 2000 jobs across, you know, Activision Blizzard.

104
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:02,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Zenimax, Xbox

105
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:20,424
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of different departments like your HR, your legal, you know, could be marketing teams, who knows.

106
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:21,765
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of that stuff.

107
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:29,154
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that represents roughly 8.6% of the gaming workforce, they said.

108
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:41,419
[SPEAKER_07]: And it, you know, obviously, you know, they said it's a painful decision, but, you know, they're providing them support during their transition and stuff like that.

109
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:48,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that's something, though, we see, though, with these acquisitions that there are going to, they're never going to keep everybody.

110
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:51,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, there are going to be layoffs.

111
00:08:51,026 --> 00:09:00,012
[SPEAKER_07]: It does suck when we're talking about like large companies like this, where those small percentages, I mean, 8.6 is still not a small percentage, but, um,

112
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:01,367
[SPEAKER_07]: It's

113
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:25,649
[SPEAKER_03]: The hardworking, you know, entry level QA customer service.

114
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking VPs were involved with this as well.

115
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:37,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is that because sometimes it feels like the highest end is not getting affected the same way, you know, and so forth.

116
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:40,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that that makes this news any easier to report on.

117
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:45,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, and certainly some folks have made some very pointed things about

118
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:51,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, those of you that were rooting for the Activision Blizzard Microsoft merger to happen must be feeling some sort of way about this.

119
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of like the number one girl, fuck you sit down.

120
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't I don't like don't come at me with that attitude.

121
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wish for this type of thing.

122
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:04,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what Loki is saying with the redundancies and stuff.

123
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is a very unfortunate sort of side effect to this.

124
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:11,451
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, to get rid of the toxicity of Bobby Kotick,

125
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:23,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things where I don't, I fear it would have been worse had his stake been allowed to stay on the industry.

126
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:23,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

127
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to kind of have this.

128
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was gonna say I want a feeling.

129
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:28,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go ahead.

130
00:10:28,888 --> 00:10:29,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

131
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:33,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it feels to me like cutting out of cancer and taking some healthy tissue with it.

132
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but

133
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:47,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel bad for the people who are affected by this, but I hope that most of those executives that went as well were his cronies.

134
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:49,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

135
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:59,319
[SPEAKER_03]: But now DarkSakura, you have an interesting follow up here too, because we're not actually just that because this actually does go deeper than redundancies, which I think is important to point out.

136
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:09,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed in our chat, of course, folks are talking about this over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, as you and her Matt says redundancy, but also it hit a lot of studios, projects, teams.

137
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, DarkSakura, you have an example of this, right?

138
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:22,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a team that was working on an unannounced survival game.

139
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:27,771
[SPEAKER_02]: They had been developing it over the last six years before the pandemic occurred.

140
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:39,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It was announced in 2022 without a name, no trailer, but it would have been their first new IP since Overwatch, which launched in May of 2016.

141
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:42,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some beautiful concept art to it.

142
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks sort of like a like one scene on here looks like people are in the real world and they're riding a bike on a nature trail and suddenly they find a portal to this magic world.

143
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're in the magic world.

144
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that would look cool.

145
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:01,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's

146
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still, um, you know, I think of how I would feel if I had spent six months, six years of my life working on something and then go, huh, nope.

147
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:18,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's not, it's not unexpected, but at the same time, you know,

148
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:21,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

149
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:34,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they might even do something with those assets or if it's just gone or I mean, a lot of times that we will find games that were cancelled and then converted into another project.

150
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:43,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, which you're literally speaking of Overwatch was once upon a time Project Titan, which was supposed to be some type of MMO successor.

151
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:46,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But it it kind of touched a lot of different things.

152
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really being

153
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:56,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Generous with cutting corners here, but I'm just going to say like, essentially, the PvP element of that MMO ended up being Overwatch.

154
00:12:56,195 --> 00:13:04,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the classes were kind of reformed as personalities, like Tracer, I think was originally just like a dasher or something like a class.

155
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:05,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they, you know, they reformed that.

156
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially, long story short, Titan evolved into Overwatch.

157
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:12,769
[SPEAKER_02]: or Dems Fightin' Herds.

158
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: size when that axe fell on that project.

159
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:39,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like those folks were, you know, some went to Hearthstone, some went to WoW.

160
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they were kind of spread out a little bit.

161
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.

162
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:46,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is something, I mean, Overwatch didn't come out to 2016, as Jamie said.

163
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So Titan was canceled like 2013, 2014, somewhere there.

164
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:50,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time.

165
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:56,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So my memory is not great, but you know, I, I, I worry if this one's ever going to see the light of day.

166
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:59,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's weird to me, I mean,

167
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

168
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:14,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Blizzard is really good at taking the must-have genre of the moment and making it a very easy pill to swallow for a mass audience.

169
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:18,598
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did with EverQuest and World of Warcraft.

170
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did with Team Fortress and Overwatch 2.

171
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:27,246
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did with Dota 2 and League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm.

172
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:28,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did.

173
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the list goes on and on.

174
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:40,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about all of their games have been really hot genres that have been extremely accessible to people that otherwise are probably not fans of that genre.

175
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is wild to me.

176
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:52,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand, I don't know all the inner workings of this project or Blizzard, and there's just some fucking questions I'm not going to get to know the answer to.

177
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just like, it's just like, whose lipstick did BB have in that episode of All Stars 3?

178
00:14:58,362 --> 00:14:59,583
[SPEAKER_03]: She's never going to tell.

179
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Some questions are never going to be answered, and this is one of them.

180
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:10,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's rough, but it's so wild to me that a survival game gets canceled the same week

181
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:20,606
[SPEAKER_03]: that a survival game is the literal lightning rod of the entire fucking industry and shattering the records that we see.

182
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:22,799
[SPEAKER_07]: We had this game.

183
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Pokemon with guns, but someone beat us to it.

184
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:30,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very clear from the concept art.

185
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:31,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nothing like that, to be clear.

186
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:36,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is still wild to me.

187
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:43,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, and I know I know that obviously a decision like this was weeks in the and nobody could have called the power world.

188
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

189
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:44,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I get all that.

190
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,294
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to correct me on that.

191
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,135
[SPEAKER_03]: But the optics are still

192
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:53,479
[SPEAKER_03]: so wild to me that that game gets canceled.

193
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:58,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hearing that there might have been difficulties with an internal engine that they were writing for that.

194
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if we're going to find out quite a bit about this game because unlike with Titan, I think you're going to have some bitter Bettys and bitter Bills and bitter B names here that are going bitter Bobs that are going to want to talk about

195
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:17,437
[SPEAKER_03]: what happened and what it was all about.

196
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:25,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned, I guess we could see some interesting stuff in the next week about what this game was all about and why they maybe pulled it.

197
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:27,784
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought it was engine issues.

198
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was seeing in the blogs.

199
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:58,827
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah but it's also hard because like that's that is one take that's being amplified and it's like the one thing we have right now so maybe but there's probably a lot of other stories too um let's see uh other comments in chat uh let's see um sorry somebody had said ah E3VL said Microsoft probably saw the game and thought it was similar to Redfall and didn't want to make the same mistake hmm

200
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:13,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably not I wouldn't say that but it could be I don't know it could be something that they've spent like X number amount of time working on production and they're not far enough into

201
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,430
[SPEAKER_07]: development to sink more money into it, I guess.

202
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:41,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it sounds like they were saying they were prototyping Unreal, they were trying to switch to Synapse, but, you know, they had a lot of time already invested into it, and perhaps, you know, not wanting to make another Duke Nukem Forever, if you will, like, you know, maybe it's just like, nah, we're just gonna cut our losses on this and go to the next thing.

203
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:50,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaji Shuto Art in chat says, I said this earlier, but it brings up how much it hurts the people working on these.

204
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,118
[SPEAKER_03]: That's six years of your life.

205
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:58,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they maybe in the future be able to go to another company for them to pick it up so all that work isn't fully lost?

206
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:00,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, probably not.

207
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:07,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the closest that could happen is that they could go to another company and use that expertise to work on a similar game.

208
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:14,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as like the art that they did, the programming they did, the code that they did, that all belongs to Microsoft now.

209
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:23,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, for, for potentially something else to come of it, you know, I'm, I'm assuming it won't, but who knows, we could get an Overwatch style thing that comes out of this.

210
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I just don't know.

211
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say at this point.

212
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,248
[SPEAKER_03]: However,

213
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:36,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just one of those type of things I was thinking about because I have said on the show and there's been some very pointed comments on this stuff on social media.

214
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be very clear.

215
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:54,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I have said on the show that oftentimes from these fires of these layoffs comes the phoenix that rises from the ashes, the indie games and the indie studios and, you know, people that are put out that go on to create their own thing and find success on their own terms.

216
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:59,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I've said that, I have always said, those that have the means to do so.

217
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:01,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody has the means to do so.

218
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:08,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a very, you know, there's a very pointed tweet from somebody affected out there right now that says something to the effect of you can't just go and start up your own indie studio.

219
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that easy.

220
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I get all that.

221
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:11,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not what I'm saying.

222
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying that, you know, hopefully for those that can do that, there are still some flowers to grow from this whole situation.

223
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:22,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly enough, I don't know how many of y'all remember,

224
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:36,828
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you remember that there were some executives, Jen O'Neill and Jay Allen Brack, who were both formerly with Blizzard, they formed their own studio with a third person.

225
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:38,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I forget what the third person was.

226
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that long ago.

227
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So to kind of the full circle answer to the question, I don't know what this studio is working on.

228
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're doing an MMO, an action game, what, it could be anything, right?

229
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,811
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're working on a survival game,

230
00:19:51,803 --> 00:20:00,128
[SPEAKER_03]: These would be prime candidates to pick up and place on a game like that if that new company has the means to do so, which it might not.

231
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:06,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, without a product yet, they only have investors and may not have all of that type of income and that sort of thing.

232
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:16,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's where you sort of hope to see it happen is ironically a lot of these executives that have gone to form their own studio.

233
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:20,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing happened with Chris Smetsim, but then he ended up coming back to Blizzard.

234
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:25,329
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know whatever happened to that studio that he formed and the thing that he was working on at some point.

235
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:26,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was that.

236
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DJ Ranma S. It was Frost Giant Studios.

237
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:31,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

238
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:31,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

239
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:43,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf says, there's an indie dev I've been talking to here who has been working on his game for seven years and I asked him, at what point do you give up on it and move on to something more feasible?

240
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:54,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it's a sunk cost fallacy at that point, you know, it's basically, you've invested so much time into it now, you can't quit because you've invested all that time into it.

241
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I understand that.

242
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:58,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It also depends on how far along you are.

243
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I spent years trying to

244
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:11,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a general understanding of like Unity and making games, which by the way, great, great segue real quick.

245
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:21,483
[SPEAKER_07]: My oldest son, who's been doing programming for God years now, finally hit the belt because they have like different belt levels in the coding

246
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:23,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Lua, LuaJS

247
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:59,035
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it, just the regular scripting blocks type language at one point?

248
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to get him on Python, because that's where a lot of it is right now.

249
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:06,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

250
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:09,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Unity, I'm kind of like, well... Python's easy.

251
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:13,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Python's not hard either.

252
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I don't know.

253
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,306
[SPEAKER_03]: As a teenager, let him do what he wants.

254
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:21,428
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fun to him because that's exciting that he's even sticking with it at all.

255
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:22,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

256
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a lot of that, like, he'll figure some of this other stuff out himself.

257
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

258
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,873
[SPEAKER_07]: With other languages, like it's all syntax for a lot of it anyway.

259
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:34,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So once you understand the fundamentals and you've done it enough times in different languages, you just start recognizing.

260
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easier to learn another language once you have a couple.

261
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:40,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said teenager because he's turning 13 this year, isn't he?

262
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,030
[SPEAKER_07]: He's already 13.

263
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:47,399
[SPEAKER_03]: He's turning 14 this year.

264
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does time go?

265
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,223
[SPEAKER_07]: The youngest just turned 10.

266
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:53,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, Julian's what, 16 now?

267
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to ask.

268
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:57,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

269
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Julian's older than that.

270
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:00,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it.

271
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,375
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Julian was on this show.

272
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot how old your child is.

273
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:07,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Julian was on this show pre-pandemic as like a 12-year-old playing.

274
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:08,278
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

275
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he playing Minecraft or one of those puzzle games or something?

276
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

277
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was giving his review on it.

278
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirate 101.

279
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:19,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like it's wild to me to think that like Julian's like fucking an adult now, pretty much.

280
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:20,644
[SPEAKER_02]: He was playing Pirate 101.

281
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:21,245
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

282
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:21,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirate 101.

283
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

284
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get him back on this show.

285
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:31,482
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, so it's probably like, you know, with your it's probably that point.

286
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having facial hair now, Julian.

287
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:38,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably that point in his life where he's embarrassed to talk to 40 year olds on their show.

288
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:41,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a little bit.

289
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:47,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know, like, some of my son's friends watch my YouTube channel.

290
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:50,440
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's because they're into, some of them are into Minecraft.

291
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,465
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, actually, he got back into Minecraft with his friends because one of his friend actually is a mod developer for Minecraft.

292
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:04,489
[SPEAKER_07]: So he, he is, his kind of claim to fame is making a really involved

293
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:14,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Witherstorm mod, which is from like, it's a monster boss, like monster thing from Minecraft.

294
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:18,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the Telltale one, Minecraft story mode.

295
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So they now bring that into actual Minecraft.

296
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:26,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a multi-phase boss and stuff, and it's like really huge, but he helped code all that stuff.

297
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:33,691
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've been like playing that quite a bit and just playing survival multiplayer, which I'm like, yes, you're back into it now.

298
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:33,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo.

299
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, wow, wow, wow.

300
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,080
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

301
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, we're getting off track.

302
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is new?

303
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:49,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did, you know, just want to say that really is unfortunate for Microsoft and Blizzard and the folks there.

304
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I should point out, I don't know if you want to kind of get the rest of this Loki.

305
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:55,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just Blizzard affected this week either.

306
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:55,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

307
00:24:55,946 --> 00:25:00,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also, you know, the Call of Duty companies, because there are so many of them.

308
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:13,431
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, basically that, you know, Sledgehammer Games, Raven Software, Infinity Ward, all impacted by these layoffs as well.

309
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Treyarch, Haimutsu.

310
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:19,953
[SPEAKER_07]: God, there's so many studios working on Call of Duty.

311
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:24,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're just cutting down on the number of studios they have working on Call of Duty, because that's a lot.

312
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:27,855
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's across the board.

313
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:30,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we kind of established that in the beginning, that it's not just...

314
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: these new companies, it's also Microsoft themselves.

315
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:40,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's across the board, just a reduction of staff, because I think it's redundancy.

316
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:45,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly some of it could be just, you know, the path of numbers for your financial year, whatever the case may be.

317
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:57,029
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm thinking with a large acquisition like this, with two large companies coming together, it's got to be redundancies for a lot of it for right now until.

318
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:02,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Later on the year, and we'll see how performance goes and then more layoffs, I'm sure.

319
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:06,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even this week, it wasn't just Microsoft either.

320
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:11,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Because by the time this news came out, I feel like almost everybody's already forgotten.

321
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Just earlier this week, there was another big gaming company layoff that had happened as well, that we need to acknowledge.

322
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:21,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Riot Games laid off 11% of their workforce.

323
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:26,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So 530 employees were laid off as well.

324
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:29,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, basically that they're

325
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:38,010
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to help them transition to their new jobs, but yeah, it's still, it's across the industry.

326
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:49,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was even said that already we are, but like not even a full month into the year and we're almost approaching half of the layoff numbers of 2023.

327
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:49,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not great.

328
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to kind of go like, well, what happened?

329
00:26:56,726 --> 00:27:02,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess a lot of people are kind of pointing at like COVID and how this industry really exploded.

330
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:10,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Years so outside of COVID, like, I mean, it's been years now, like, I'm sorry, like, I'm starting to less believe the COVID thing.

331
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,811
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of like, I don't know what it would really be.

332
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:18,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe it could possibly be COVID in the sense that

333
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:24,945
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a lot more people playing games and engaging with online games and stuff like that.

334
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:29,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe profits were a bit higher because of that stay-at-home order type thing.

335
00:27:29,768 --> 00:27:32,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the things have- Games as a service were more attractive when they were stay-at-home.

336
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

337
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:41,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and now, now that people are both not just staying at home, they're going out and doing things, but on top of that, you know, the,

338
00:27:42,873 --> 00:28:01,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Economy as a whole is kind of on the downturn and so people are being a little bit more conservative with the money that they're spending on these services and as such they are not hitting their impossibly optimistic goals of making a profit every year and a great enough profit for their shareholders

339
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:05,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's maybe that's how it's coming into play.

340
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:10,539
[SPEAKER_07]: But I certainly wouldn't believe that it's like, oh, well, man, COVID put us behind schedule.

341
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,342
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, well, that was years ago at this point.

342
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:13,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, come on.

343
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:15,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be like impacted.

344
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:21,956
[SPEAKER_07]: 5 years out from covid or whatever, you know, however long this is going to last.

345
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:25,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't see that as realistic.

346
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I could believe, though, the not hitting expectations because those expectations were skewed based off of the, you know, stay at home orders that were going around.

347
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:37,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I would pin it more on the second half of what you're saying there.

348
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,189
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100 Matt in chat over twitch.tv.

349
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:45,350
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Network says it was sad to see that Blizz customer service was gutted.

350
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Every every dealing I've had with their customer service has been a plus.

351
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:52,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently those positions are being outsourced elsewhere, which is a shame.

352
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:56,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's probably going to fall in line with Microsoft's customer service, which I don't know.

353
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:59,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had to deal with them a lot, but I think it's pretty well known fact.

354
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:02,996
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that is offshored to save on money.

355
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just when it comes to customer service,

356
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:09,179
[SPEAKER_03]: You and this is somebody who worked in customer service for a very long time.

357
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:09,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't anymore.

358
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like I can just kind of say this very openly when it comes to things like that.

359
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You get what you pay for.

360
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:44,754
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think with World of Warcraft and the fact that that game really needs its fans more than ever like the people that have really held on to World of Warcraft all this time throughout the controversy and throughout everything else I mean granted Dragonflight overall was a better expansion and kind of where the game was at coming into it but I just feel like like if a lot of people get poor customer service in World of Warcraft with the quality of

361
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:49,416
[SPEAKER_03]: the game and the social community and all that goes downhill.

362
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:53,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this is the decision you're going to have to blame for that.

363
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:58,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I'm not sure this is the smartest business decision.

364
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, I don't know how this directly impacts like the GM system, or World of Warcraft.

365
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:13,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'm making it up in my head, which I'm fully willing to admit, but you got to be really careful outsourcing customer service jobs, because you're going to get exactly what you pay for.

366
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:24,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're trying to sell this 10-year commitment to WoW with this new storyline and the next three expansions and all this stuff?

367
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:27,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a slippery slope, folks.

368
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:33,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope there was a little more information going into this decision than it sure seems like it.

369
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and sjo100map just points out the parts that are cruel, saying they drag these employees back to the office from remote, many of them having to move across the country only to let them go months later.

370
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And you kind of sit here and go, there ought to be laws against that.

371
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,701
[SPEAKER_03]: There ought to be fucking laws against that, straight up.

372
00:30:53,701 --> 00:31:00,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized that, you know, again, the push towards unionization and stuff might help with some of that.

373
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:05,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, whether folks are unionized or not, like this was going to, they can do this.

374
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:09,484
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to give certain types of notices and things like that with union involvement.

375
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:15,165
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the fact if they were unionized or not would not necessarily impact this decision at the end of the day.

376
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It just might have impacted how it played out.

377
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:25,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, like this type of shit where they're uprooting people, moving them and all that, it's gotta be illegal.

378
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:38,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there ought to be some type of, you know, penalty to the company that does it to make it a lot less attractive of an option, like a tax penalty, or lack of tax write off penalty to the companies that do this.

379
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:43,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, what do I know?

380
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:45,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a podcast, not a gaming company.

381
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But I play a lot of games and so do we.

382
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:51,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

383
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll get into some other news.

384
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:54,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

385
00:31:55,646 --> 00:32:04,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's pretty lengthy, actually, mostly because I was testing out games, translations of them in different things.

386
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:08,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I bought Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

387
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:14,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't started it yet, but I wanted to play because it's open world and I love that universe.

388
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:18,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I played X-Men Arcade at work.

389
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam.

390
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know who else was there playing it at work?

391
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:23,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew.

392
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:31,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Dracula X, Nocturne in the Moonlight, R-Type, Strider 2, Captain Commando, Summer Carnival 92, Wrecka, Dodonpatch to make myself cry,

393
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:59,657
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course my usual streaming stuff, Rurounou Hiho, which I'm getting pretty far in that game, I think I'm on like day 12 on the third scenario.

394
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing some Baldur's Gate 3, I started over on that one, playing Genshin Impact, the game I didn't think I would like and now super like, and of course Cult of the Lamb, although I think my Friday Cult of the Lamb night is going to become a Genshin night, just saying.

395
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:24,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame Orange Rite.

396
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame them paying me.

397
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:31,667
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I made on that sponsorship from them?

398
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:32,307
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 bucks.

399
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

400
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:39,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people who were doing me the favor to make the account already had accounts and it tracks IP.

401
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:46,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I am super happy because I have enough to pay for my TwitchCon ticket when it comes up and the party.

402
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:12,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been very, very pleased.

403
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:18,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not going to say it's going to pay all my bills, but the support of people have been really great.

404
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:24,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has allowed me to expand some stuff that I can do for Orange Lounge, too.

405
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the new intro I'm working on.

406
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:34,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are you speaking of which, since you brought up TwitchCon, I think we should probably let our listeners know a few things here.

407
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, of course, you're going to TwitchCon again.

408
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,660
[SPEAKER_03]: That probably won't surprise anybody, right?

409
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

410
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

411
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what do you think?

412
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:44,382
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go to TwitchCon this year?

413
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:44,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

414
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's I'll go to TwitchCon.

415
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:47,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

416
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:48,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So you are going you have not been to it.

417
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:53,046
[SPEAKER_07]: When was the last time you went to a convention?

418
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:53,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 2009.

419
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:53,446
[SPEAKER_07]: E3.

420
00:34:57,196 --> 00:35:05,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have not been to a convention since 2009, but what I'm getting at is here, you are- Could have been the like Sacramento, the game thing.

421
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Academy?

422
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:11,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Sacramento, it's like the- Oh, the indie developer collective, which is nice.

423
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:19,768
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cute little, but I think we know the difference between a local day show and a, you know, a mega con that, you know, gets talked about nationwide.

424
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:23,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So- No, I've already got my hotel booked for,

425
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So you are going to TwitchCon 2024.

426
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:29,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's here's the interesting thing.

427
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I am on the fence right now.

428
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big part of the reason why and if I go it's going to be a last minute kind of decision.

429
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:42,179
[SPEAKER_03]: A big part of the reason why is that it's two weeks after DragonCon.

430
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:51,447
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed the timing and it's two weeks after DragonCon, which Alan and I take an entire week off work to make happen.

431
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:56,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, there's the Labor Day holiday in there, but DragonCon itself goes Thursday.

432
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Thursday is the official day.

433
00:35:58,192 --> 00:36:01,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, like the con itself is five days.

434
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:06,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the flights and everything, we stay an extra day to catch up with Bobby and friends in the area.

435
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:10,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we can like, you know, go to the wrap up that the digital media track usually does and stuff.

436
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: like like we end up out there for an entire week which is great and that's that's always going to be my number one priority in the conventional world like that's just like I've gone to over 10 Dragon Cons now I think this is actually gonna be my 11th in person this year that's always gonna take precedence so it's very tricky that TwitchCon is two weeks later because that makes trying to navigate my day job and my responsibilities there a little trickier I will yeah they're usually early October

437
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:42,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they moved to mid September and that makes it a lot harder for me now.

438
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying no, because I'm my it's, I will say that, you know, again, I don't, I have a policy about not really getting into my day job here on this show, especially because I found out I have co workers that listen, by the way, hi, you know who you are.

439
00:36:55,986 --> 00:37:02,309
[SPEAKER_03]: But in all seriousness, I never talked about it.

440
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:02,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I warned him.

441
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I used the F word on that show.

442
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,271
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not that's a side of me you don't see during the day.

443
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:17,255
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, anyway, it probably like I could probably do a Friday because Fridays tend to be a little lighter.

444
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:18,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get into specifics.

445
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:19,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Fridays tend to be a little lighter.

446
00:37:19,756 --> 00:37:21,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can probably take a Friday and like

447
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:47,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Get fly down there Thursday night literally fly and like come back Sunday I might be able to swing that But I also kind of don't want to do it unless Alan can do it because he's actually more into twitch than I am ironically Yeah, that's the thing is like I'm not like I don't stream much on twitch I would like to stream more on twitch, but you know there's a thing called time and the limited amount of it that's in a day that doesn't really work out for me, but

448
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just want to go there to see the Hermitcraft people.

449
00:37:50,598 --> 00:38:03,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's a completely selfish need of mine, but, you know, that and, like, other people that are, you know, streamers and stuff that I play with and whatnot.

450
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:05,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what TwitchCon is.

451
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:09,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know what I'm going to do there for all of the... I'm leaving.

452
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming in Thursday, leaving Monday, so... Yeah.

453
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:13,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

454
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:15,592
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

455
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we'll see.

456
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:27,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that I like to do at TwitchCon is look at the new equipment that is coming out for streaming and music mixing and things like that.

457
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:28,638
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some good stuff.

458
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be fun.

459
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

460
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And certainly I would like to meet up with people and try to network even though

461
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:40,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Every part of my body doesn't want to do that, but like I know I need to.

462
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:47,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, it's that whole introvert, you know, forcing myself out there and type of thing.

463
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:52,322
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think it'd be fun to like get to hang out with some of these people.

464
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:54,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully can do that.

465
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:55,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good time.

466
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:55,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

467
00:38:56,784 --> 00:39:04,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's I'm gonna say though, if there ends up being a GDQ Express thing at Twitch, and Bobby ends up going there too.

468
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's got the same Dragon Con problem I do, but maybe not the travel issue so much.

469
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:11,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So if he ends up there too, then it's gonna be it's gonna get harder and harder.

470
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:20,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But I you know, obviously, if my day job is like no, it's you know, or I just feel like it's gonna be too difficult to navigate, then no, I'm not going to do it.

471
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:22,256
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say this, I will say this.

472
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:32,315
[SPEAKER_03]: If for the first time ever, I get a panel at TwitchCon, if I can do a panel at TwitchCon, I'll I'll just fucking make it happen.

473
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll just I'm gonna make it work.

474
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:40,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to because at that point, it's like, okay, if I if I've got that type of thing at TwitchCon, I'll make it happen.

475
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna just put that out there into the universe.

476
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,105
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can get a panel at TwitchCon, I will just

477
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:52,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll drive down Friday after work and just not sleep to do a panel at TwitchCon, okay?

478
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,402
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have to.

479
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:56,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that is- that is what I'll do.

480
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:58,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

481
00:39:58,008 --> 00:40:04,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I still- I'm still looking at getting folks for an Airbnb.

482
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:05,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know.

483
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:09,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be great.

484
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:17,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that the first year I went, and honestly enough, it was a lot of fun.

485
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:27,763
[SPEAKER_02]: We had five of us staying in the Airbnb, someone slept on a cot in the front room, so it ended up being pretty affordable.

486
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:32,150
[SPEAKER_03]: was that was that the one with intoxicated or he had to rebrand?

487
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

488
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

489
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:33,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

490
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,631
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's back to intoxicated.

491
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:36,791
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a temporary thing.

492
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

493
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they got it back.

494
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:38,711
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

495
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:39,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

496
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:42,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all right, let's move on.

497
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:43,673
[SPEAKER_03]: We got on a Twitch content.

498
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:49,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I thought the listeners ought to know maybe for their own planning that interesting things are afoot this year.

499
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:54,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like Loki may have the capacity to do conventions again.

500
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:55,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to.

501
00:40:55,996 --> 00:41:04,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it happen and it was a very impulse thing of mine where I was like, I just want to go somewhere and do that.

502
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,701
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was able to book it.

503
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:10,884
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife may come with me to not go to TwitchCon, but to like...

504
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:20,129
[SPEAKER_07]: go do other things while she wants to like meet up with a friend like hopefully get a friend to come down to my old roommate Johnny's in San Diego.

505
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:27,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny would love to see her I'm sure so and there's there's a lot to do in San Diego like San Diego is a great place.

506
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:28,874
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, have a good time.

507
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,455
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

508
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's let's move on.

509
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:37,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll let you know con developments as we come across them.

510
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,864
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, let's get into the gaming news of the week.

511
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:46,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gaming week.

512
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:46,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, that's right.

513
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:47,526
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even do it.

514
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:48,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

515
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:48,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

516
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do mine either.

517
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:49,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

518
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:51,088
[SPEAKER_03]: We got derailed from DarkSakura's week.

519
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:52,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even check if DarkSakura finished.

520
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:55,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you finish DarkSakura?

521
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:55,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

522
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, then Loki, your gaming week.

523
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:00,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I did Minecraft stuff, as usual.

524
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:05,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Editing, put out an episode today that I've been procrastinating on for a while.

525
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:12,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly because I've been working hard in Fever Dream 2, which is wrapping up on Tuesday, I think, at the end of the month.

526
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:17,561
[SPEAKER_07]: So I need to film the last bits of that, but I had a total of...

527
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:24,161
[SPEAKER_07]: 3, no, 4 builds that I did on that server.

528
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:27,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Each were over 25,000 blocks.

529
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:28,526
[SPEAKER_07]: The largest being 75,000.

530
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:39,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to edit it in a way to be the most obnoxious YouTuber possible.

531
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, the whole premise is it's a fever dream.

532
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,393
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nightmare, sort of.

533
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:48,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the content is basically the complete 180 of what I normally make.

534
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:50,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be ridiculous.

535
00:42:50,238 --> 00:42:51,880
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all meme builds.

536
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,462
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all memes.

537
00:42:55,462 --> 00:42:58,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody on the server loved it because they're like,

538
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:00,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's horrible.

539
00:43:00,483 --> 00:43:03,865
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also love it.

540
00:43:03,865 --> 00:43:05,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So look for that soon.

541
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:10,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and I am testing merch right now.

542
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:12,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So merch coming very soon.

543
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:22,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my artwork commissioned from Karakato, who redrew and he's a great Mega Man fan artist.

544
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:23,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And

545
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:30,864
[SPEAKER_07]: He redrew all of my Robot Masters and my player character in a Mega Man, like a classic Mega Man style.

546
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:33,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so fucking good.

547
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:34,867
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so good.

548
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm making t-shirts out of that because I need to have, I need to have two of them because I already ordered two, but if they come back quality good, then I will link everybody to the store and we'll put more stuff on there and, you know.

549
00:43:47,737 --> 00:43:48,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I just want a t-shirt.

550
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not looking to make any money off this stuff.

551
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:52,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really just, I just want the artwork on a t-shirt.

552
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:53,908
[SPEAKER_03]: You need something to wear to TwitchCon.

553
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:54,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

554
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly my thought.

555
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,182
[SPEAKER_07]: That was exactly my thought process.

556
00:43:58,182 --> 00:43:59,123
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

557
00:43:59,123 --> 00:43:59,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

558
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:02,345
[SPEAKER_03]: We need some new VOG stuff, so I have something to wear to DragonCon.

559
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:03,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in my old VOG stuff.

560
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:07,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that baseball jersey.

561
00:44:07,568 --> 00:44:21,296
[SPEAKER_07]: If this site ends up working out, because it was easy to set up, and they have a lot of options as far as the different types of things you could get printed, and also the different, like, it's not just like t-shirt, it's

562
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:25,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Many, many, many, many, many, many, many types of things.

563
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:27,039
[SPEAKER_07]: All the crap.

564
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, all the crap.

565
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can really customize what you want to do.

566
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:33,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And setup was free.

567
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:36,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So if this does work out, I'll point you in that direction.

568
00:44:36,684 --> 00:44:39,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it may work out pretty good.

569
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:39,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

570
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

571
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if that's it for your game of the week, I'll make mine quick since I was eager to jump ahead.

572
00:44:45,736 --> 00:44:49,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much a lot of the same stuff I've been talking about FF14.

573
00:44:49,180 --> 00:45:01,714
[SPEAKER_03]: A good friend of mine IRL started playing so it's been kind of fun revisiting like the old content again because I'm trying to help him through but actually he's been kind of doing a lot of it on his own because you can do it all with NPCs now you don't have to wait to group up for all that's nice.

574
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:26,079
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so um he's he's already almost like to the end of base realm reborn he's only been playing for like a week so um it's pretty cool um so i've been playing a lot of that and then uh diablo 4 the latest season season 3 started and um i i hate to say this but like you know especially in lieu of some previous things we were talking about and some of the negative stuff with blizzard but like i i'm gonna keep it real and i'm not gonna sugarcoat things

575
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,623
[SPEAKER_03]: The season in Diablo 4 is not in a good place, and it's not particularly fun.

576
00:45:31,623 --> 00:45:34,966
[SPEAKER_03]: The twist is not good.

577
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:53,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why it was felt that in a game where it's all about mow down the enemies as fast as you can, watch the numbers fly, explosions everywhere, why it was felt that a good mechanic would be, let's have rooms full of traps to slow you down.

578
00:45:54,011 --> 00:46:01,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have to do platforming and try to like get all the mobs to get you what it's just, I don't know how they fix it.

579
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:02,278
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.

580
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fundamentally broken concept.

581
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But to Blizzard's credit, they are quickly trying to fix it.

582
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, and I think this is the most ridiculous of all the things they've done in the season is that you have this thing where like you put a pearl in the altar before you start the dungeon.

583
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:22,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can get it counts down every time you get hit by a trap,

584
00:46:23,535 --> 00:46:26,798
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, 2, 1, the treasure disappears at the end.

585
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:29,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Or half the treasure disappears at the end, or something like that.

586
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get hit with a trap 3 times, that's it.

587
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to do that in 5 seconds when I ran it.

588
00:46:34,564 --> 00:46:44,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Blizzard has already patched it, so now it counts down from 10 instead of 3, and it's like a 1.5 second gap from getting hit before you can get hit again.

589
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:50,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will give Blizzard props, they are trying to address it pretty quickly, and they are monitoring player feedback.

590
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:59,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So props for that, but I just think the concept at its core was not thought through the way it maybe should have been.

591
00:46:59,638 --> 00:47:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

592
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:04,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the weakest season compared to 1 and 2, quite frankly.

593
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my opinion.

594
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,241
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm still playing it because...

595
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:14,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Diablo and I need the cosmetics and I'm a consumer whore.

596
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:15,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

597
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:16,917
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

598
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And how.

599
00:47:18,258 --> 00:47:18,678
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

600
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:26,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to move on into, oh, Questbuster says the drama around the issues with season three have kept me from trying it so far.

601
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:27,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Infinite Wealth.

602
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:28,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

603
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth came out.

604
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:37,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Our pal Bobby talked at length about it on his show because y'all know he loves the Yakuza series, especially ever since he kind of started

605
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:42,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Unofficially being the team up for that with games done quick.

606
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:42,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, nothing.

607
00:47:42,957 --> 00:47:50,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like whenever there is a Yakuza game and the runner that runs that game, I feel like Bobby is always there for the last three years.

608
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,281
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a part.

609
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:55,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you know, he just I think genuinely likes the series where it's gone.

610
00:47:55,763 --> 00:48:02,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it too but we all know the meme that I haven't finished the last game yet because I get distracted by all this other stuff.

611
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do really feel like I need to go back and finish the last game.

612
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:07,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

613
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:09,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to do it.

614
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as my priorities go,

615
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is out at the end of the month, the day I get home from my cruise that I'm going on.

616
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:25,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got about three weeks to replay Final Fantasy VII Remake on PlayStation 5.

617
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:28,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of my my more immediate plan.

618
00:48:28,754 --> 00:48:35,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at one of those, you could watch Neko-chan do it.

619
00:48:35,337 --> 00:48:37,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are they streaming it?

620
00:48:37,638 --> 00:48:38,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

621
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:38,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

622
00:48:40,997 --> 00:48:45,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the same reasons, in anticipation of the new release.

623
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha, gotcha.

624
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:54,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's sometimes hard for me to follow the narrative game stuff on streams, because if I miss anything, then I'm like, I missed it.

625
00:48:54,784 --> 00:49:02,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, sometimes I did watch Lapin play a little bit of it, but only the parts that I had already played.

626
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:03,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

627
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:03,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

628
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:09,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, um, let's move into some gaming news.

629
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:16,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can move ahead and Loki is going to start us off with the game that just like it's it's uh, it's not going away.

630
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:17,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's making its mark on 2024.

631
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:23,611
[SPEAKER_07]: PowWorld has been doing incredibly well.

632
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:34,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It just came out in Early Access on January 18th and already has sold over 7 million copies and that was 8 million.

633
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That was as of a few days ago.

634
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:45,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only imagine that, yeah, 8 million copies in 6 days.

635
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:48,121
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's doing incredibly well.

636
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:54,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you know, with all the attention on it, you know, there's been a lot of speculation, like,

637
00:49:56,906 --> 00:50:03,294
[SPEAKER_07]: This game obviously is very inspired by Pokemon.

638
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:08,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there some foul play in the sense that maybe some of the designs were stolen?

639
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:11,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, people being...

640
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:19,052
[SPEAKER_07]: company tryhards decided to point out to the pokemon company in case they weren't already aware that hey some of the stuff looks you know

641
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:53,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar to your Pokemon and maybe you should take a look at that And so of course they put out a statement the Pokemon company saying we've received many inquiries regarding another games Or another company's game released in January of this year We have not granted any permission for the use of the Pokemon intellectual property or assets in that game we intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to act and

642
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:58,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically look into any infringement that may be occurring.

643
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's any infringement.

644
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:05,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly there's a lot of stuff that's inspired by it.

645
00:51:05,056 --> 00:51:14,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know people were trying to come off and say, like, oh, well, some of these look like they're exactly the same as the models if you resize them or whatever the case may be.

646
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:17,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

647
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:20,955
[SPEAKER_07]: It may be a hard argument to make.

648
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:26,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously we talked about this at length on the show a little bit last week and a little bit about the AI misdirect.

649
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:29,661
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, all the AI stuff is smoke and mirrors.

650
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:34,885
[SPEAKER_03]: None of that is relevant to the actual conversation because nobody has proven that AI is in this game.

651
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:35,546
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that.

652
00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:39,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, the CEO made shitty statements, but all CEOs make shitty statements about AI right now.

653
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:42,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Every game has AI, it just depends on the nature of it.

654
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's right.

655
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:49,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about, and you're right, you reminded me, we made that separation about AI art is the issue.

656
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:57,114
[SPEAKER_03]: AI as far as like mechanics, generation, when they talk about, we're going to patch the AI in the game for the animals to be smarter.

657
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:01,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think people generally have a problem with that AI.

658
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:04,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's AI art and art in all its forms.

659
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:10,722
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D modeling, writing, voice acting, art.

660
00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:14,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where all of us are taking issue, is AI.

661
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:17,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, all smoke and mirrors when it comes to PAL world as far as I'm concerned.

662
00:52:17,389 --> 00:52:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: None of that exists in the game that we know.

663
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

664
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:24,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think AI art isn't even necessarily a bad thing per se.

665
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:27,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just AI art that's trained off of copyrighted works.

666
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:28,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

667
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:30,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is all of it.

668
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:30,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

669
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:35,359
[SPEAKER_03]: AIR generating the land in your own engine and all that stuff.

670
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you're right.

671
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an important clarification.

672
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what the machine has learned from.

673
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

674
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:43,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

675
00:52:43,596 --> 00:53:05,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Hypothetically, if someone were to actually create a AI art generative program that is based off of original artwork made by like specific artists, like in a company, even like I would, it'd be still be kind of wary, like say, like, let's just pretend that Blizzard decided to create an AI art generative art program.

676
00:53:05,623 --> 00:53:12,749
[SPEAKER_07]: When you work for a company, any material that you present on the company's dime, in the company's facility, on the company's material, belongs to the company after you've left.

677
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:14,611
[SPEAKER_07]: The same goes with freelance work.

678
00:53:32,486 --> 00:53:36,892
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not entitled to keep that except for terms of your own portfolio.

679
00:53:36,892 --> 00:53:39,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Your client owns the artwork that you make for them once they've paid you for it.

680
00:53:39,956 --> 00:53:41,438
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't like to hear that, but that's 100% that.

681
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:43,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I get that.

682
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:48,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's more of like mimicking, say, their style or something like that.

683
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:57,990
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever, like, right now, that's not a scenario that's actually happened, because I don't think anybody's using models that aren't trained on copyrighted material.

684
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:01,793
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so essentially, they're going to look into it.

685
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:04,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I think both companies are out of Japan anyways.

686
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:09,620
[SPEAKER_07]: So assuming that's the case, it's more of a local type of

687
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:14,083
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, legal battle there.

688
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:26,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan does not have any fair use laws when it comes to, you know, which even, even if that wasn't, which yes, a hundred percent that, but even if that wasn't the case, a fair use is like the news and commentary.

689
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:31,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not one profitable product in the exact same vein as the other.

690
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:37,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, another fucking social media invented smoke and mirrors bullshit is that whole fair use thing.

691
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:37,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

692
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:39,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

693
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:47,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what it is to me, is that, and I fully expected Nintendo to file the cease and desist this week, so I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen.

694
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:54,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm aware it happened with the mod that went on YouTube that was like literally Ash Ketchum and Pikachu in the- Right.

695
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Nintendo shut that shit down immediately.

696
00:54:57,921 --> 00:54:59,442
[SPEAKER_03]: But they didn't shut this down immediately.

697
00:54:59,442 --> 00:55:00,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's interesting to me.

698
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:15,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that they put out this statement instead is really interesting, because to me, that says that they are hearing this whole thing about is is the actual artwork potentially in the game, like the actual fucking models?

699
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:16,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they in the game?

700
00:55:16,136 --> 00:55:19,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if so, that that's that's theft.

701
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a theft of a different type.

702
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may be where they're going with it right now.

703
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:24,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

704
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:25,263
[SPEAKER_03]: and more!

705
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:56,642
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna have to pay their own forensic expert data stuff to go in, figure it out, compare the files, compare the da-da-da-da-da, and they're gonna have to figure out, are Pakachu and Jogglypoof, are they actually Pokemon?

706
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:56,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Or

707
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:05,149
[SPEAKER_03]: are they indeed their own created things that are heavily inspired by because that is going to dictate where Nintendo goes with the next steps.

708
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:11,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's why we're going to have to wait a little bit because we can't just say, oh, this guy on Twitter said they're the same, so therefore they're the same.

709
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:16,639
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they will have to have receipts, emails, timelines.

710
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,243
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got to collect all of that stuff before they go to a courtroom in any country.

711
00:56:22,243 --> 00:56:22,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Guarantee it.

712
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:24,145
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's being looked at right now.

713
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:31,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've been aware of this game for a while now, I would imagine, because this isn't something that just came out of the blue.

714
00:56:31,593 --> 00:56:32,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you?

715
00:56:32,715 --> 00:56:33,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I wasn't.

716
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:36,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the trailer.

717
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:38,280
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I remember the trailer for it.

718
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I mean, but again, this whole like, are the actual models in the game?

719
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:46,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that would have shown from the trailer.

720
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:49,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're even saying that the actual models are in the game.

721
00:56:49,227 --> 00:56:56,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what they're they're claiming is that basically, they're saying that the PAL world devs

722
00:56:57,597 --> 00:57:05,541
[SPEAKER_07]: rip the models from the Pokemon games and then use that as a basis to create their own models.

723
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:16,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, okay, hey, I'm going to take a Pikachu out of here and then I'm going to add some horns and do some things and change the texture, but the general body and proportions are based off of something else.

724
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little harder to prove, I think, but I mean, they'll do their best.

725
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:31,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I linked something in chat that I'll go ahead and tell people where to find it.

726
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:48,404
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look up fair use on collegeart.org, which is a resource I've used myself for my own artwork, it goes into like a real world description on copyrighted material and legit fair use.

727
00:57:49,384 --> 00:58:03,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if the Pokemon Company decided to have it out with them, and I'm just thinking in terms of American copyright law, and I'm not an attorney, so blah blah, whatever, I'm not an attorney.

728
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:10,439
[SPEAKER_02]: The company behind Power World needs to be able to justify their objective in art.

729
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:19,535
[SPEAKER_02]: and why they repurpose copyright art instead of creating their own work.

730
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:26,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um... It's... They're not doing commentary on Pokémon.

731
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they might come in and try to claim parody, I don't know.

732
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:38,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but... They... Even if you are copying another company's work, you are still required to cite them as a source?

733
00:58:40,522 --> 00:58:54,521
[SPEAKER_02]: or either label it in there, embed it, have it in the credits, unless there is a legitimate aesthetic basis for not doing it, and even so, that's a very weak argument.

734
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:55,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just wanted to throw that out there.

735
00:58:57,123 --> 00:59:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as PowerWorld goes itself, I pretty much feel the same way I do last week.

736
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:03,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I played the game last weekend.

737
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:05,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually haven't played it since.

738
00:59:05,047 --> 00:59:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not it's just because, again, I've been very clear.

739
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:12,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I have other gaming priorities right now, like and PowerWorld is still in early access.

740
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:15,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And number one, it's not cross platform between Steam and Xbox.

741
00:59:15,271 --> 00:59:16,952
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge drawback for me.

742
00:59:16,952 --> 00:59:20,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's just the game crashed on me a couple of times.

743
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:23,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's still drawbacks of early access.

744
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:24,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like and I said this last week,

745
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:34,742
[SPEAKER_03]: The game I'm going to play in six months, assuming it exists and isn't shot out of the sky by lawyers, which I kind of think it will exist.

746
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:37,624
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, how much are they maybe going to pay?

747
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:43,388
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like the game I'm going to play in six months is not going to be the same game I played last weekend.

748
00:59:43,388 --> 00:59:44,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to touch it.

749
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:58,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of, it goes back to this whole thing, like a game that is heavily inspired by as many genres as this game is, because again, this game isn't Pokemon at all to me.

750
00:59:58,456 --> 01:00:01,377
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Ark with Pokemon instead of dinosaurs.

751
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:03,958
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this game is.

752
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:04,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But games that copy

753
01:00:06,027 --> 01:00:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonners and stuff so explicitly are never as good as this one turned out which is wild and that's what makes this so interesting to see from where a legal perspective this goes but if Nintendo can bring the receipts and emails and all that and if Nintendo proves

754
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:36,726
[SPEAKER_03]: What, essentially, this company's denying on social media is that, you know, they're saying, we ran it by our lawyers, we know we're legally disdained, da-da-da, but if Nintendo brings receipts to the table that show our fucking files are in that game...

755
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:46,600
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably going to be one of the most interesting cases in gaming ever.

756
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm putting it up there with like Capcom versus Data East.

757
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:53,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be the biggest thing in gaming ever.

758
01:00:56,613 --> 01:01:05,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, I've been that college student before, you know, but I'm gonna say right now, that's gonna fuck over their careers for life.

759
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, and somebody else signed off on that.

760
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:11,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Or told them how to cut corners.

761
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:13,409
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, here's the thing.

762
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:19,535
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I understand being in their position, I don't want to say, I mean,

763
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:31,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it should definitely, if that ends up being the case, I think it should absolutely be used as a cautionary tale for all of these other people who are like, oh, I'll do artwork for your channel.

764
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:36,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all, you know, stolen bits, you know, done with AI.

765
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:41,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, I really, really think that if that ends up being the case,

766
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:54,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel bad for a new artist having to put that on there, but at the same time, that precedent has gone around that, yeah, it's okay to take from this, that, and the other.

767
01:01:54,525 --> 01:01:55,186
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fine.

768
01:01:55,186 --> 01:01:56,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and do it.

769
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:58,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about being too original.

770
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:08,856
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't using their own creativity, I think, and are looking for the fast answer.

771
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:11,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be completely off base, who knows?

772
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:15,300
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still think that that should be a cautionary tale.

773
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:31,231
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would like to see the industry do as a response to this, and AI, and all of it, honestly, is I would really like to see us lift up artists in the video game industry, and recognize them, and call them out, and acknowledge them,

774
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying we have to create a cult of celebrity around it and I understand in the day and age of social media that may be a hard thing to avoid but I feel like the more we can like feature artists and we do this in some places like you know Final Fantasy art and you know character designs and stuff I feel like the more we can kind of do that and recognize and uplift artists and so forth and

775
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:54,813
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

776
01:03:13,038 --> 01:03:22,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Booing artists and really lifting up and acknowledging their value and spotlighting them and showcasing them, giving them awards where it's due and all that is help.

777
01:03:22,684 --> 01:03:28,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is something we need to do as fans to push back on a lot of this.

778
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

779
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:31,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the comic book industry.

780
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:32,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, true.

781
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:34,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Their main source is artwork.

782
01:03:34,813 --> 01:03:52,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, there's a lot of, you know, we have artists in that industry that we talk about years later, you know, you know, we still we still pitch about Rob Liefeld to this day, you know, but I think that that we need to

783
01:03:53,639 --> 01:04:00,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We absolutely need to do that and in fact I think there should just be like a dedicated award thing for excellence in video game art.

784
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:03,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Specific, you know, visual arts.

785
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:10,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a music, you know, award given out for compositions.

786
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:13,673
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with some of the same categories you might see at the Grammys.

787
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:19,757
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Best New Artist, or, you know, Best Composition, or, you know, things like that.

788
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, I find it amusing that people are calling this the Pokemon killer and people are playing this and demanding that Game Freak fix the Pokemon game issues and want them to suffer.

789
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:37,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real, there's no Pokemon killer and as long as the games sell, I doubt Game Freak will fix those issues people have with the games.

790
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:54,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna, and I know this isn't you saying this, DJ Ranma S, so when I'm about to get on my soapbox and say this, I'm not saying this at you, but I'm saying this at all of the people, and I'm saying this at the media, and I'm saying this at the headlines, and the clickbait that I am continuing to see about this game.

791
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is not fucking Pokemon.

792
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:08,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I swear to fucking God, if you see an article that says this game is just Pokemon with guns, delete, unbookmark, go away.

793
01:05:08,645 --> 01:05:13,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not continue to patronize that website because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

794
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:21,511
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not bothering to play the games that they're commentating on, and they themselves are control C, control V'ing from other sources.

795
01:05:22,011 --> 01:05:24,392
[SPEAKER_03]: They are guilty of the things that they are saying.

796
01:05:24,392 --> 01:05:27,273
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not Pokemon with guns.

797
01:05:27,273 --> 01:05:33,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sick and fucking tired of seeing that is fucking lazy to call this game Pokemon.

798
01:05:33,735 --> 01:05:35,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't fucking played it.

799
01:05:35,395 --> 01:05:42,837
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're calling this game Pokemon, there are no turn-based battles in this game, which is what Pokemon is.

800
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:47,939
[SPEAKER_03]: The real issue is semi-colon dramatic pause for effect.

801
01:05:49,022 --> 01:06:01,794
[SPEAKER_03]: The real issue is this is a survival game with potentially, allegedly, lifted, read stolen, Pokemon assets.

802
01:06:01,794 --> 01:06:03,676
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the problem.

803
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:10,102
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a survival game with potential Control-C, Control-V Pokemon in it.

804
01:06:10,102 --> 01:06:11,804
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the issue.

805
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:13,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You call this Pokemon with guns again?

806
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:21,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope to God a virus inflicts your computer and uninstalls Steam for you.

807
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:21,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Rob.

808
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:22,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

809
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:25,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby Yoda.

810
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:30,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.

811
01:06:30,168 --> 01:06:30,808
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

812
01:06:30,808 --> 01:06:32,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

813
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

814
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:37,032
[SPEAKER_03]: But.

815
01:06:37,032 --> 01:06:38,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

816
01:06:38,032 --> 01:06:40,874
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm also willing to admit, I don't watch a Star War.

817
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:48,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying, I'm not trying to profit off of clicks on articles talking about Baby Yoda.

818
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:50,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Grogu.

819
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:51,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, all right.

820
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:55,410
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just called Baby Yoda before we knew the name of the character.

821
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:58,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Then afterwards, people call him Baby Yoda.

822
01:06:58,071 --> 01:06:59,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, those are stupid people.

823
01:06:59,171 --> 01:06:59,912
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

824
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:02,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

825
01:07:02,573 --> 01:07:05,534
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an official name in canon at that point.

826
01:07:05,534 --> 01:07:06,635
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just referred to as the Child.

827
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:09,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that could be any child that's in that.

828
01:07:09,871 --> 01:07:10,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy.

829
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:13,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy the live listeners are eating the child.

830
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:16,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy the live listeners are eating up my rant.

831
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:17,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get that off my chest.

832
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the podcasters enjoy that too.

833
01:07:19,361 --> 01:07:22,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claus says something here.

834
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:23,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to respond to it though.

835
01:07:23,525 --> 01:07:28,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It says they say that because of the imagery and taking it out of context.

836
01:07:30,538 --> 01:07:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: In one sentence, you have defined the entire problem with social media as it is today.

837
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Marinate on that.

838
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:45,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read Tigerclaw's comment again.

839
01:07:45,121 --> 01:07:53,443
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that because of the imagery, the picture, the headline, and taking it out of context.

840
01:07:56,007 --> 01:08:05,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Tigerclaw realizes in one sentence he has just summarized the entire fucking problem with Twitter.com.

841
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:07,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not isolated to Twitter.

842
01:08:07,652 --> 01:08:08,253
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

843
01:08:08,253 --> 01:08:08,713
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

844
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:09,673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everything.

845
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mostly Twitter.

846
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:12,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, no, it is.

847
01:08:12,174 --> 01:08:12,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It's threads.

848
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:13,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Instagram.

849
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:14,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's TikTok.

850
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all of it.

851
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all of it.

852
01:08:16,076 --> 01:08:17,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's humanity.

853
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:22,359
[SPEAKER_02]: People for millennia have looked for

854
01:08:23,243 --> 01:08:32,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, think about, you know what book titles were like maybe 200 years ago where there were like extra descriptions and they went on for four entire fucking lines?

855
01:08:32,531 --> 01:08:35,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Now books have like a single word.

856
01:08:35,854 --> 01:08:43,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nature to try to isolate things to the easiest and simplest description to make it comprehensible.

857
01:08:43,741 --> 01:08:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just human nature.

858
01:08:45,282 --> 01:08:45,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lazy.

859
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:55,607
[SPEAKER_03]: The most egregious example of this that everybody knows is movie posters and movie advertisements that take a review completely out of context.

860
01:08:55,607 --> 01:09:01,451
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, this movie was visually beautiful, but what a hunk of steaming shit it was.

861
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:07,555
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll put the quote that says visually beautiful said Time magazine on the movie poster, right?

862
01:09:07,555 --> 01:09:10,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Like taking shit out of context to advance your own agenda.

863
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:15,351
[SPEAKER_03]: you're yeah, DarkSakura 100% cosigned.

864
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,173
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tale as old as time.

865
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:22,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And social media is just our shining beacon example of that right now.

866
01:09:22,836 --> 01:09:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: But especially twitter.com just because of because of because of the owner of twitter.com who is the worst offender in this category.

867
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:31,362
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

868
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:36,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're gonna move on, we're gonna move on.

869
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:42,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about what is happening with Overwatch 2's competitively.

870
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:46,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I had heard that the layoffs at Blizzard this week, you know, affected some people with Overwatch 2, and I hope

871
01:09:48,257 --> 01:09:52,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hope they haven't, um, scaled back on this game too much.

872
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:59,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I feel like I'm, I'm enjoying playing Overwatch with friends and I do get in there and do it, you know, I'm not good at it, but you know, we have fun, we laugh and that's what it's all about.

873
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:07,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So video games are, I know some people take it a little more seriously and really enjoyed things like the Overwatch league to give them something to root for and to the better their game.

874
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:11,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people were watching a lot of football games today and they'll be watching another one in two weeks.

875
01:10:11,788 --> 01:10:15,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like to watch the Overwatch league and unfortunately there is no more Overwatch league.

876
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is next?

877
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:27,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Blizzard has teamed up with the ESL Faceit group, the EFG, to run what is called the Overwatch Champions Series, which is going to be the OWCS.

878
01:10:27,633 --> 01:10:39,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be an open format circuit where teams from North America, Europe, Middle East, and North Africa, EMEA, and Asia, they can all compete without having to have their own franchise.

879
01:10:39,438 --> 01:10:43,480
[SPEAKER_03]: EFG is going to operate the Overwatch Championship Series in North America and EMEA.

880
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:48,741
[SPEAKER_03]: while Korean esports organizer WDG will be over this in Asia.

881
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:51,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna have regional qualifiers and tournaments.

882
01:10:51,382 --> 01:11:00,004
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be in-person events at DreamHack Dallas, which is starting May 31st, and DreamHack Stockholm on November 22nd.

883
01:11:00,004 --> 01:11:03,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Bobby, I don't see DreamHack Atlanta here, but who knows?

884
01:11:03,465 --> 01:11:11,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight teams will compete at the events, and then those that qualify for DreamHack Stockholm will duke it out and become the first Overwatch champions.

885
01:11:12,507 --> 01:11:16,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's also going to be the first time this has been played in Europe in five years.

886
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:19,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Qualifiers start in February, more information to come.

887
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:23,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it is interesting that now it's like you could kind of make your own team.

888
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:30,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to have like, you know, the San Francisco Shock and all the, you know, kind of the league behind it.

889
01:11:30,381 --> 01:11:38,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they're still trying to make sure that this plays out on a large, visible stage, such as DreamHack.

890
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So, interesting.

891
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:44,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Squenix has revealed that there has been some

892
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:09,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, action taken for people that are selling counterfeit merchandise in China.

893
01:12:09,714 --> 01:12:12,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, distributing counterfeit merchandise in China.

894
01:12:12,738 --> 01:12:17,845
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out a press release that detailed that nine people were charged in May 2023

895
01:12:19,547 --> 01:12:22,249
[SPEAKER_02]: and Guangdong Province.

896
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:27,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Six were involved in distributing products, while three were charged for manufacturing.

897
01:12:27,272 --> 01:12:32,216
[SPEAKER_02]: This included character items from Final Fantasy and NieR Automata.

898
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:46,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And they first filed the request, and I'm going to quote, based on information gathered through independent investigations.

899
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:56,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And they worked with an investigation firm, others in the industry, and basically laid the smackdown.

900
01:12:56,987 --> 01:12:59,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I remember back in the day,

901
01:13:00,618 --> 01:13:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: of, uh, you know, having to check and see, is this a real, is this a real Vincent figure?

902
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:14,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a real Dragon Ball CD or is it Sonmei?

903
01:13:14,111 --> 01:13:15,212
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

904
01:13:15,212 --> 01:13:21,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it was pretty, it was, uh, they're protecting their stuff, they have a right to.

905
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:29,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially something like Square Enix is kind of prime stuff to get counterfeit products made too.

906
01:13:29,554 --> 01:13:35,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually I actually kind of surprised this is like, you know, we don't hear about this more often.

907
01:13:35,336 --> 01:13:37,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it's interesting.

908
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:41,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's just a lot of difficulty in being able to this.

909
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:46,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is going to be a very minor dent in the counterfeiting room, you know.

910
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we would see like identical covers of things released, but the company name changes.

911
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:02,486
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's, uh, yeah, you want to, you want to double check where you're coming from.

912
01:14:02,486 --> 01:14:11,094
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be sure, publish, like, I remember, remember my quest to find a non bootleg, uh, Bust a Move 2 soundtrack?

913
01:14:11,094 --> 01:14:11,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

914
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:17,282
[SPEAKER_02]: If I found one, I paid 45 bucks for it because I needed the real thing.

915
01:14:17,282 --> 01:14:22,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the same with my original Bust A Move soundtrack and one of my, uh, two mix albums.

916
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:28,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but yeah, you know, you want to, you want to read those labels.

917
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:38,328
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what you're looking for and don't get me started about, did I tell you that someone sent me a bootleg purse and an Hermes Birkin bag?

918
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:38,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.

919
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:43,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a fake Birkin.

920
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:50,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I might go out with it sometime and just see who notices, but I have a fake Birkin that someone sent me because it was funny.

921
01:14:50,806 --> 01:14:55,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you want to just be 100% certain of of what you're looking at.

922
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to things.

923
01:14:58,672 --> 01:14:59,153
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

924
01:14:59,153 --> 01:15:04,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, moving on on a completely different note, Loki.

925
01:15:04,997 --> 01:15:05,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I think.

926
01:15:05,477 --> 01:15:06,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you muted?

927
01:15:06,078 --> 01:15:06,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

928
01:15:06,518 --> 01:15:07,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the families.

929
01:15:09,747 --> 01:15:18,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Nintendo Switch online service for the 3DS and Wii U are going to be shut off on April 8th at 7 p.m.

930
01:15:18,511 --> 01:15:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Eastern Time.

931
01:15:19,832 --> 01:15:28,136
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, you will not be able to play the Wii U or 3DS online anymore.

932
01:15:28,136 --> 01:15:29,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's unfortunate.

933
01:15:30,922 --> 01:15:34,305
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew this was coming, so it's not... Eventually, yeah.

934
01:15:34,305 --> 01:15:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the Pokemon stuff is exempt for now, which is the one thing a lot of people have been asking about.

935
01:15:39,991 --> 01:15:44,255
[SPEAKER_07]: The two things that are working are Pokemon Bank and PokeTransporter.

936
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:49,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are going to continue to operate.

937
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,542
[SPEAKER_03]: For now.

938
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:51,663
[SPEAKER_07]: For now.

939
01:15:51,663 --> 01:15:54,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Until there's something, something else, maybe.

940
01:15:56,201 --> 01:16:03,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, speaking of something else, Nintendo has set some new dates for some concerts that were going to be rescheduled.

941
01:16:03,286 --> 01:16:07,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you all remember, but there was supposed to be a Nintendo Live 2024 in Tokyo.

942
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:10,331
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going to be January 20th, 2021.

943
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:16,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember, Nintendo received credible threats targeting employees and the spectators.

944
01:16:16,736 --> 01:16:19,458
[SPEAKER_03]: The Legend of Zelda concert will be on Nintendo's YouTube channel February 9th at 8am Eastern.

945
01:16:38,815 --> 01:16:44,159
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Splatoon 3 concert will be February 10th on the same, you know, YouTube channel.

946
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,641
[SPEAKER_03]: But they haven't announced the official time for that yet.

947
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:49,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you can gather it's probably going to be a similar time.

948
01:16:49,884 --> 01:16:52,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're wondering why is it so damn early?

949
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:54,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because it's for Japan time.

950
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:56,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little different when you consider the time zone changes.

951
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:14,646
[SPEAKER_03]: some people have been kind of running with this as oh nintendo's gonna announce something in early february because they're doing the concerts in early february i'm i mean i i kind of think that's wishful thinking i mean i'm not saying they're not doing that i just think people

952
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:24,532
[SPEAKER_03]: People are really hoping and wishing that a new Switch announcement is true and in the very near future, but wishing and hoping doesn't make it true.

953
01:17:24,532 --> 01:17:28,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, these types of things are maybe coincidences.

954
01:17:28,454 --> 01:17:30,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it is true, but I really think it is.

955
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:34,238
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

956
01:17:48,052 --> 01:17:57,575
[SPEAKER_03]: They still did the concerts at the event with just nobody there, and they recorded it so all those people could still, you know, get paid and do their thing.

957
01:17:57,575 --> 01:18:03,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to put it out on YouTube now at this particular time that's not too far in the future after that happened.

958
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:10,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a little time to edit it together and, you know, clean it up a little bit, maybe make it a little more television presentable.

959
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:17,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that's all it is and we don't need to tinfoil hat about when the new Switch is being announced.

960
01:18:17,968 --> 01:18:27,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I guess this is a good place in the show to bring up the rumors are heating up on the Switch's successor and oh, it's an 8-inch LED tablet and all this stuff and

961
01:18:28,015 --> 01:18:31,576
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah, there's probably a lot of that stuff out there that is true.

962
01:18:31,576 --> 01:18:44,719
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, we're not going to know until we know which on Nintendo's timetable will be Tuesday afternoon, they're going to say Thursday morning, you're not going to want to miss this direct.

963
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's as much notice as we'll get.

964
01:18:46,799 --> 01:18:53,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's hoping it's this week, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

965
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,701
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on to something a little more classic DarkSakura.

966
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:01,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all know I like Laserdiscs.

967
01:19:01,721 --> 01:19:04,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bunch of Laserdiscs.

968
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:06,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And other people like Laserdiscs too!

969
01:19:06,363 --> 01:19:07,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

970
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:18,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the Japanese Game Preservation Society, in their annual newsletter, has started doing their first migration of Laserdisc games.

971
01:19:22,913 --> 01:19:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about in part of bringing in things like of course Dragon's Lair, Road Avenger, games that have already been converted to CD game, but now they're bringing in things that were for the MSX.

972
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:45,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Starfighters is one of them, compared to Advanced Wars.

973
01:19:45,135 --> 01:19:55,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was Don Quixote, A Dream in Seven Crystals, not to be confused with Super Don Quixote, but it's like an RPG.

974
01:19:57,429 --> 01:20:01,732
[SPEAKER_02]: maps, random battles, stuff.

975
01:20:01,732 --> 01:20:10,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, looking at various different ways to emulate them.

976
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:21,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the arcade games have Daphne, MSX have OpenMSX, right now there is no known emulator for the Pioneer Laser Active.

977
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:21,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

978
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:41,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Since that particular game, the Don Quixote, A Dream in Seven Crystals, was on LaserActive, you know, this is now making this game that's going to be, it's going to make it an unavailable game unless you have the system in the game, and they put it out there for you again.

979
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:52,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is that they're not just backing up the video footage, but they are capturing all of the data contained within the game data,

980
01:20:55,792 --> 01:21:02,098
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sampling everything at the highest quality that they can sample.

981
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:07,962
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it's like 8 terabytes per laserdisc.

982
01:21:07,962 --> 01:21:16,490
[SPEAKER_02]: They are passing it through a decoder so they can decode the analog video, all digital data and audio tracks as well.

983
01:21:18,731 --> 01:21:26,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once they bring it in and be sure that it will read, then they can work on conversion.

984
01:21:26,217 --> 01:21:30,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to also develop ways to read PCM data.

985
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're putting into it.

986
01:21:32,782 --> 01:21:34,323
[SPEAKER_02]: They're putting into it.

987
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:40,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited to see what comes out of it.

988
01:21:40,388 --> 01:21:41,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see their success.

989
01:21:41,769 --> 01:21:47,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, if this works with these laser active games, they can expand this into

990
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:56,263
[SPEAKER_02]: others in the LaserActive library and other systems out there.

991
01:21:56,263 --> 01:22:04,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And Laserdiscs, I mean, first of all, they're kind of harder to find, for one thing.

992
01:22:04,192 --> 01:22:08,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't find... Well, working players are harder to find.

993
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:23,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not super difficult to do a repair on a Laserdisc player, but there are parts that you have to order specialized from companies where you create it.

994
01:22:23,174 --> 01:22:24,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just sort of like with pinball.

995
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:38,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we, you know, while we have Blu-ray and all of this, you know, this was our digital media.

996
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:46,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are lots of, you know, issues that can go on with a laser disc, you know, apart from being scratched or otherwise damaged or heat damaged.

997
01:22:46,847 --> 01:22:50,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a there's a thing called disc rot.

998
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:52,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have explained it to people before.

999
01:22:52,372 --> 01:22:54,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone remembers.

1000
01:22:54,774 --> 01:22:58,857
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there was, I think, a version of I want to say Beauty and the Beast.

1001
01:23:01,058 --> 01:23:06,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one Disney movie that like half of their pressing ended up having disk rot.

1002
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now that laser disk is very valuable.

1003
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:18,164
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, what happens with disk rot is that

1004
01:23:23,716 --> 01:23:34,684
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of layers on there that are usually aluminum, they can be mixed with different chemicals, and sometimes it will...

1005
01:23:36,505 --> 01:23:42,708
[SPEAKER_02]: create these little bubbles, I guess, like spots under them.

1006
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:50,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those layers in between them can become contaminated and they're unreadable.

1007
01:23:50,892 --> 01:24:00,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, the biggest cause is oxidation, but others with contaminants and ultraviolet light damage, like leaving them out in the sun.

1008
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:03,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were far more susceptible to that than, of course, our modern DVDs.

1009
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,459
[SPEAKER_02]: CDs also are susceptible to it.

1010
01:24:06,419 --> 01:24:12,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but making sure that you find discs in pristine condition to do this.

1011
01:24:12,823 --> 01:24:21,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could get expensive, you know, I, I remember how expensive laser discs were just ew.

1012
01:24:21,288 --> 01:24:25,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, um, you know, you're looking for some of these rarer games.

1013
01:24:25,271 --> 01:24:34,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, it's going to be pretty expensive to find, you know, when they're getting into the later games of, of acquiring some of these.

1014
01:24:34,676 --> 01:24:35,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.

1015
01:24:36,684 --> 01:24:41,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of people in chat very happy to hear about game and media preservation.

1016
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:44,588
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100Matt says, yay for game and media preservation.

1017
01:24:44,588 --> 01:24:47,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Seuss says, indeed, always cool to see this kind of stuff preserved.

1018
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:51,371
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster with fingers crossed that they succeed on this.

1019
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:54,893
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100Matt going so far as to suggest, I want a LaserDisc mini console.

1020
01:24:54,893 --> 01:24:57,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the light gun games on there as well as Dragon's Lair and the other classics.

1021
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:58,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Sign me up.

1022
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:00,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm down.

1023
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:47,411
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe maybe it'd be funny if they had like if they just came with like little DVDs in them to sort of mimic a laser disc or like the three inch mini discs now for the state like a little three inch like GameCube games were that those are yeah I love those yeah that'd be funny all right uh moving on Loki

1024
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:51,518
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1025
01:25:51,518 --> 01:25:59,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So the day before is finally gone from the Internet, or at least gone from all of their official accounts.

1026
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:03,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So we knew the game was shutting down.

1027
01:26:03,261 --> 01:26:05,141
[SPEAKER_07]: The website's gone inactive.

1028
01:26:05,141 --> 01:26:06,742
[SPEAKER_07]: The game's been pulled from Steam.

1029
01:26:06,742 --> 01:26:08,182
[SPEAKER_07]: The servers are now turned off.

1030
01:26:08,182 --> 01:26:14,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, right before they decided to inactivate their Twitter account, they also blamed

1031
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:24,789
[SPEAKER_07]: the players and social media folks out there for the failure of their game, saying that they were too hard on it.

1032
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:32,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's fair, but what they did, that's that's the way they got to blame something.

1033
01:26:32,394 --> 01:26:34,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's blame somebody else.

1034
01:26:34,135 --> 01:26:35,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't take accountability.

1035
01:26:35,736 --> 01:26:38,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So but it's gone.

1036
01:26:38,078 --> 01:26:40,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And let this be a lesson.

1037
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:43,701
[SPEAKER_07]: For something, but don't always believe the hype, I guess.

1038
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:44,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Push F to pay respects.

1039
01:26:46,104 --> 01:26:46,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloodborne

1040
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:20,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally all started as an April Fool's joke and it was being brought to light and now the creators have been contacted by Sony, the IP holders, because this game was originally going to release at the end of the month.

1041
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:27,694
[SPEAKER_03]: But the indie team says, long story short, we need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart.

1042
01:27:27,694 --> 01:27:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: We will do this but that requires a short delay.

1043
01:27:30,476 --> 01:27:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, they kind of assure that the game is going to look different, but, and it's no longer going to be Bloodborne, but it is still coming.

1044
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:42,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess it's just going to be, you know, souls-like horror.

1045
01:27:42,562 --> 01:27:43,823
[SPEAKER_03]: No, or souls-like cart.

1046
01:27:43,823 --> 01:27:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know what they can, probably can't call it that either.

1047
01:27:46,464 --> 01:27:50,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, it's going to be just called something else, maybe in line with it.

1048
01:27:50,406 --> 01:27:55,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we don't know the new release date, but they're saying we will let you know ASAP when we do.

1049
01:27:56,269 --> 01:28:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: We were expecting something like this to happen and the idea of having full creative control is kind of exciting.

1050
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really weird comment to me.

1051
01:28:05,431 --> 01:28:13,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you commit to a release date of the month as it was if we were honestly expecting something like this to happen?

1052
01:28:13,033 --> 01:28:16,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That's almost like you were intentionally pushing Sony's hand.

1053
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:18,174
[SPEAKER_03]: That part of it is weird.

1054
01:28:18,174 --> 01:28:19,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else I'm cool with, but I'm like,

1055
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:22,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you say that?

1056
01:28:22,347 --> 01:28:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get people.

1057
01:28:24,308 --> 01:28:27,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this was first announced in early 2022.

1058
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Lilith Walther is the developer.

1059
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:35,752
[SPEAKER_03]: They were also behind the Bloodborne demake, which was like Bloodborne on the PS1.

1060
01:28:35,752 --> 01:28:43,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloodborne Kart will have 16 maps, 12 racers, a full single player mode, boss battles even, and split screen multiplayer.

1061
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:47,637
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will no longer have actual characters from Bloodborne.

1062
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:48,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that.

1063
01:28:49,659 --> 01:28:50,500
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1064
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you were surprised.

1065
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:53,282
[SPEAKER_02]: No one.

1066
01:28:53,282 --> 01:28:54,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one.

1067
01:28:54,423 --> 01:28:55,504
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1068
01:28:55,504 --> 01:29:04,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let's talk about other classic games here that deserve inspirational successors in a segment we love to do here at Orange Lounge Radio right after this bumper.

1069
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:23,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1070
01:29:23,265 --> 01:29:27,889
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1071
01:29:27,889 --> 01:29:30,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for this week?

1072
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:45,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked Radical Dreamers, not to be confused with Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross, although there is a tie-in eventually.

1073
01:29:45,656 --> 01:29:54,078
[SPEAKER_02]: But Radical Dreamers came out in 1986, and it's a text-based visual novel adventure game.

1074
01:29:54,078 --> 01:30:01,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was done by Square for the Satellaview, the online peripheral for the Super Famicom.

1075
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is part of the Chronos series.

1076
01:30:04,922 --> 01:30:21,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's why I'm saying there were, like, there was, uh, the Chrono Trigger Radical Dreamers edition that did include Radical Dreamers, but this, I'm speaking of the, the, the standalone on it.

1077
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:24,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's, that's my, my point.

1078
01:30:24,491 --> 01:30:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, uh, the game, uh, basically you are, you are, uh,

1079
01:30:32,702 --> 01:30:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing an infiltration led by Kidd, aided by Surge and Magil, and you're looking for an artifact called the Frozen Flame, and to get some revenge too.

1080
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:50,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to go through, it's all text choices.

1081
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:56,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also directed and written by Kato Masato, who was the Chrono Trigger writer.

1082
01:30:59,504 --> 01:31:05,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very, it was a lot darker, I'll put it that way, darker than Chrono Trigger.

1083
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:14,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there were some, you know, funny scenes in there, music was also done by Mitsuda Yasunori, who did the music in Chrono Trigger.

1084
01:31:14,794 --> 01:31:18,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened in three months and Kato wasn't really happy with it.

1085
01:31:21,918 --> 01:31:30,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get a big commercial release because it was, you know, Satellaview exclusive to Japan.

1086
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kato actually did not want it on the PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger because of quality concerns, but the ROM had been released and there is a fan translation.

1087
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:55,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, moving onward, like I said, this is a text-based adventure, and like, when you get into combat, you have to choose, you know, fight, magic, run, you know?

1088
01:31:55,841 --> 01:32:00,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and sometimes there'll be some more complex commands, like...

1089
01:32:01,306 --> 01:32:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, stab something in chest, slash at hand, you know.

1090
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:11,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to make these quickly before a timer runs out.

1091
01:32:11,574 --> 01:32:18,900
[SPEAKER_02]: You have health being monitored, although you can't see, it's invisible.

1092
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:32,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Kids Affection for Surge that is also tracked and it determines whether or not he survives the end fight.

1093
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:39,297
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the scenes are rendered with static backgrounds.

1094
01:32:39,297 --> 01:32:43,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as those who are here live can see.

1095
01:32:47,191 --> 01:32:53,616
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also do have a variant of New Game Plus.

1096
01:32:53,616 --> 01:32:56,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is only available on the first playthrough.

1097
01:32:56,898 --> 01:33:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you get your one ending, you go through and you can do other endings.

1098
01:33:05,325 --> 01:33:09,228
[SPEAKER_02]: You have up to six endings.

1099
01:33:09,228 --> 01:33:14,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are funny and they allude back to different things that happen in Chrono Trigger.

1100
01:33:16,853 --> 01:33:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, you're going through, you have different scenes, different areas, like you have the Viper Manor, you have a lot of exposition, of course it happens since this is in text, you find Ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal,

1101
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:53,481
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, you learn more about Luka from Chrono Trigger, who is, of course, Kid's adopted caretaker.

1102
01:33:53,481 --> 01:33:59,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are all these other scenarios that are available to play that are, like I said,

1103
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:17,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny or serious, you know, six different ones and of course it was developed by Square and it was supposed to cover the unfinished business of Chrono Trigger but

1104
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1105
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't actually played it yet.

1106
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:26,422
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been on my list to play for a moment.

1107
01:34:26,422 --> 01:34:37,644
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of the darker writing came from Kato's state of mind, like kid being kind of nihilistic.

1108
01:34:37,644 --> 01:34:44,646
[SPEAKER_02]: But his whole goal with this and for Chrono Cross were to encourage people to

1109
01:34:46,468 --> 01:34:50,691
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to follow their own personal dreams.

1110
01:34:50,691 --> 01:35:01,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Although he said there was a lot of personal freedom in creating this and that making it a text-based adventure made it more acceptable to make it darker.

1111
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:05,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was sort of like a survival action.

1112
01:35:05,682 --> 01:35:09,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Resident Evil had just come out.

1113
01:35:09,525 --> 01:35:09,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

1114
01:35:11,434 --> 01:35:20,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he considers the game to be unfinished, because Square wanted it done in two months.

1115
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:27,898
[SPEAKER_02]: The music, of course, is absolutely gorgeous, done by Mitsuda Yasunori.

1116
01:35:27,898 --> 01:35:36,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it is a little bit more relaxed than how some of the things have been for Chrono Trigger, and he said that he was very influenced by Russian folk music.

1117
01:35:39,223 --> 01:35:48,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the music in there eventually made its way sort of as quotes for Chrono Cross.

1118
01:35:48,973 --> 01:35:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, about half the music in Radical Dreamers was reused in Chrono Cross.

1119
01:35:54,318 --> 01:35:55,339
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as

1120
01:35:57,984 --> 01:36:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Other releases that it got, like I said, there was a fan translation, but it did get an official translation as part of the Chrono Cross Radical Dreamers edition.

1121
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:24,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it had a worldwide release April 7th, 2022 for Microsoft Windows, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One with translations in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German.

1122
01:36:24,361 --> 01:36:24,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It was...

1123
01:36:26,454 --> 01:36:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very well written, it was an interesting plot, and it was fairly decently received, but other people did agree that it felt a little unfinished.

1124
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:48,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was considered a very in-between story.

1125
01:36:48,204 --> 01:36:55,227
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Kato said he wanted to redo Radical Dreamers properly, and that's what led into making Chrono Cross.

1126
01:36:56,147 --> 01:37:05,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So he wanted to finish Kid and Surge's story and so that's why they're the main people in Chrono Cross.

1127
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:14,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So they even refer to different events in Chrono Cross for things that happen directly in Radical Dreamers.

1128
01:37:14,855 --> 01:37:18,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, Radical Dreamers

1129
01:37:19,688 --> 01:37:24,571
[SPEAKER_02]: is like an alternate timeline for them.

1130
01:37:24,571 --> 01:37:38,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Kato was supposed to be, well, he confirmed, by the way, that the character Gil was supposed to be Magus and was going to be in Chrono Cross, but he was scrapped from it, for example.

1131
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So just all kinds of different things.

1132
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:45,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one that had been on my radar to play.

1133
01:37:46,887 --> 01:37:55,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got around to it, but there's a lot of people who don't exactly realize what this is, you know.

1134
01:37:55,814 --> 01:37:59,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to give it a little bit of love.

1135
01:37:59,377 --> 01:38:00,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1136
01:38:00,658 --> 01:38:01,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Radical Dreamers.

1137
01:38:03,636 --> 01:38:05,037
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1138
01:38:05,037 --> 01:38:11,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Admittedly, one I have not, I mean, I knew of this game, but never played it myself.

1139
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:15,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I keep forgetting, like, oh, there's like a text adventure game on the Super Nintendo.

1140
01:38:15,502 --> 01:38:16,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Satellaview.

1141
01:38:16,783 --> 01:38:17,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1142
01:38:17,323 --> 01:38:19,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the big thing.

1143
01:38:19,884 --> 01:38:29,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with what Questbuster said, because I was going to be going over that, is that it's been in the attempts to preserve a lot of the Satellaview games.

1144
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:38,632
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the few of them, I think, that got a full release outside of Japan.

1145
01:38:38,632 --> 01:38:40,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1146
01:38:40,033 --> 01:38:40,313
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1147
01:38:40,313 --> 01:38:41,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1148
01:38:41,893 --> 01:38:42,273
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1149
01:38:42,273 --> 01:38:43,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good.

1150
01:38:43,374 --> 01:38:46,355
[SPEAKER_02]: If I made a band, I'd call it Radical Dreamers.

1151
01:38:46,355 --> 01:38:48,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet some of these had to have taken that name by now.

1152
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:51,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also a song in Chrono Trigger at some point.

1153
01:38:51,136 --> 01:38:51,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

1154
01:38:51,476 --> 01:38:52,056
[SPEAKER_03]: In Chrono Cross.

1155
01:38:52,056 --> 01:38:52,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1156
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's check out some other quick headlines from around the industry in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1157
01:38:59,924 --> 01:39:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, some headlines quick.

1158
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:28,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, apparently the producer of Zelda, Eiji Aonuma, was spotted at Universal Studios on site during the park construction of their new section, which I think is the Donkey Kong themed area.

1159
01:39:31,055 --> 01:39:38,157
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, leading to suspicions that could there be a Legend of Zelda part of the theme park coming?

1160
01:39:38,157 --> 01:39:41,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, obviously at some point.

1161
01:39:41,378 --> 01:39:42,518
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.

1162
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:48,099
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to not make one of their popular properties into theme park fodder.

1163
01:39:48,099 --> 01:39:50,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that is eventually going to happen, I think.

1164
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:54,081
[SPEAKER_07]: But as of right now, no, nothing has been confirmed other than

1165
01:39:54,961 --> 01:40:00,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are people spying on people at the construction sites for a theme park?

1166
01:40:00,784 --> 01:40:05,867
[SPEAKER_07]: But you do you, I guess.

1167
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:07,628
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a little bit disappointing.

1168
01:40:07,628 --> 01:40:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember how there was supposed to be this big live action Final Fantasy 14 television series?

1169
01:40:15,693 --> 01:40:16,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it got canceled.

1170
01:40:17,398 --> 01:40:19,380
[SPEAKER_03]: We took around a fantastic pilot script by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton.

1171
01:40:39,017 --> 01:40:45,502
[SPEAKER_07]: along with a multi-season plan they built with our showrunners, but got rejected across the board.

1172
01:40:45,502 --> 01:40:52,367
[SPEAKER_07]: The size of the scale needed to do it right proved too much for anyone to want to risk.

1173
01:40:52,367 --> 01:40:53,848
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

1174
01:40:53,848 --> 01:40:56,410
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1175
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:59,392
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1176
01:40:59,392 --> 01:41:03,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Lael, I spent money on a thing, Rob.

1177
01:41:03,374 --> 01:41:04,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1178
01:41:05,273 --> 01:41:07,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it this in the story?

1179
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:09,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love it.

1180
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:17,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So Microids Records is helping to commemorate the Atari 50.

1181
01:41:17,883 --> 01:41:23,647
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an anniversary soundtrack that is going on with Atari.

1182
01:41:23,647 --> 01:41:31,173
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a collection of just different, you know, songs and sound pieces

1183
01:41:32,133 --> 01:41:36,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since 1983, composed by Bob Baffi.

1184
01:41:36,094 --> 01:41:41,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a big homage to the history of Atari.

1185
01:41:41,076 --> 01:41:45,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going on shelves on April 17, 2024.

1186
01:41:45,998 --> 01:41:49,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ordered this for myself as an early birthday present.

1187
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:49,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

1188
01:41:50,765 --> 01:42:03,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention during my gaming week, I busted out the Evercade that I talked about a few weeks ago, because I got some of my, I ordered some more cartridges, some, some that went out of print, including the Atari Collection 2, which has Yars' Revenge on it.

1189
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:09,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So I absolutely did play Yars' Revenge and yet another collection this week, but some games never get old.

1190
01:42:09,409 --> 01:42:12,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of them.

1191
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:13,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'll be getting the vinyl though.

1192
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:14,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be a lot.

1193
01:42:14,651 --> 01:42:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's on gold vinyl.

1194
01:42:21,012 --> 01:42:25,614
[SPEAKER_02]: and really beautiful packaging.

1195
01:42:25,614 --> 01:42:26,615
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, minimalist.

1196
01:42:26,615 --> 01:42:27,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into it.

1197
01:42:27,835 --> 01:42:29,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally getting it.

1198
01:42:29,336 --> 01:42:34,318
[SPEAKER_03]: D'Artesia in chat says, I'm just surprised this didn't get an 8-track release.

1199
01:42:34,318 --> 01:42:35,699
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been fitting.

1200
01:42:35,699 --> 01:42:36,439
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1201
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:38,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I tell you Dan gave me an 8-track the other day?

1202
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,441
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's awesome.

1203
01:42:40,441 --> 01:42:41,722
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it is?

1204
01:42:41,722 --> 01:42:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Please say ABBA.

1205
01:42:42,882 --> 01:42:45,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Fleetwood Mac Rumors.

1206
01:42:45,023 --> 01:42:46,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good one, too, though.

1207
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:48,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to know what?

1208
01:42:48,532 --> 01:42:49,112
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1209
01:42:49,112 --> 01:42:53,956
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a kid, I used to own this same album on 8-Track.

1210
01:42:53,956 --> 01:42:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that.

1211
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:56,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.

1212
01:42:56,478 --> 01:42:57,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1213
01:42:57,259 --> 01:42:57,679
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1214
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:58,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about this.

1215
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Stevie Nicks is a goddess that walks this earth.

1216
01:43:01,402 --> 01:43:02,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

1217
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:03,304
[SPEAKER_03]: She's pretty cool.

1218
01:43:03,304 --> 01:43:04,244
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1219
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:07,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to going back to rapid fire news.

1220
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about this.

1221
01:43:08,728 --> 01:43:10,690
[SPEAKER_03]: This crossed our desk this week.

1222
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:13,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Hilltop Works is the name of the company.

1223
01:43:13,852 --> 01:43:15,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually put out a tweet this week.

1224
01:43:15,933 --> 01:43:18,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilltopworks, they localize Japanese video games.

1225
01:43:18,615 --> 01:43:19,416
[SPEAKER_03]: They do patches.

1226
01:43:19,416 --> 01:43:23,598
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, they recently did Rowdy Princess on the PlayStation 2.

1227
01:43:23,598 --> 01:43:26,920
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of did a whole little translation patch for that and so on.

1228
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do a lot of stuff.

1229
01:43:28,682 --> 01:43:30,403
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually put out a poll.

1230
01:43:30,403 --> 01:43:35,466
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, is there a Japan-only retro game that you'd love to see an English fan translation for?

1231
01:43:35,466 --> 01:43:37,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I now have a suggestion forum where you could submit requests.

1232
01:43:37,807 --> 01:43:39,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a whole little forum there.

1233
01:43:39,849 --> 01:43:39,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1234
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:42,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I bringing it up here on OLR?

1235
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:48,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the top replies on Twitter, President Kat.

1236
01:43:48,596 --> 01:43:49,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1237
01:43:49,336 --> 01:43:49,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the game.

1238
01:43:49,776 --> 01:43:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1239
01:43:50,497 --> 01:43:53,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even realize this was in our show role.

1240
01:43:53,739 --> 01:43:56,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just replying to it at the start of the show.

1241
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you saw it on the show role.

1242
01:43:57,921 --> 01:43:58,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

1243
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:02,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Suki Ban So Chow Ren Owi, DarkSakura

1244
01:44:19,269 --> 01:44:26,172
[SPEAKER_03]: and I asked DarkSakura to translate it back in like 2008 or 2009 when this was first a thing because it was on the Nintendo Wii.

1245
01:44:26,172 --> 01:44:28,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, Oh, it's basically President Cat.

1246
01:44:28,653 --> 01:44:40,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that made me get on my whole soapbox about why aren't we releasing this kind of stuff on the Wii here in the US is everybody would play a fucking game called President Cat.

1247
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:41,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves cats.

1248
01:44:41,638 --> 01:44:45,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're allergic, you can't help but think cats are a little bit adorable.

1249
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:45,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we need

1250
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:47,040
[SPEAKER_03]: More games like this.

1251
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:51,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is it is really funny to me.

1252
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,482
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years later, there might finally be redemption.

1253
01:44:53,482 --> 01:44:59,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to be a pain in the ass to localize.

1254
01:44:59,044 --> 01:45:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, given the graphical elements on top of that, that are are, you know, have writing on it.

1255
01:45:05,346 --> 01:45:07,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

1256
01:45:07,146 --> 01:45:08,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making this happen.

1257
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:10,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make President Cat trend again.

1258
01:45:10,307 --> 01:45:20,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm assuming Hilltop Works has, I mean, if they're doing stuff on PlayStation 2, they're in there, you know, patching those, you know, newer consoles as well.

1259
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:24,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's already Wii fan translations existing.

1260
01:45:24,404 --> 01:45:27,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1261
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:29,390
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have a President Cat TV show now.

1262
01:45:31,346 --> 01:45:34,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, would be better than a lot of the crap they're putting out there now.

1263
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:36,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1264
01:45:36,148 --> 01:45:36,868
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1265
01:45:36,868 --> 01:45:43,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel around the world and see what games are coming out this week, even if President Cat is not is still not yet one of them.

1266
01:45:43,911 --> 01:45:45,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.

1267
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:45,352
[SPEAKER_03]: this week?

1268
01:45:46,055 --> 01:45:50,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot, but we're in January, so it's to be expected.

1269
01:45:50,117 --> 01:45:59,403
[SPEAKER_07]: We have The Lost Legends of Redwall, The Scout Anthology on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

[SPEAKER_07]: BlazBlueEntropyEffect on PC.

1272
01:46:10,686 --> 01:46:18,073
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got GrandBlueFantasyRelink on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1273
01:46:18,073 --> 01:46:28,242
[SPEAKER_07]: We've also got Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.

1274
01:46:28,242 --> 01:46:29,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixi is totally into that anime.

1275
01:46:31,283 --> 01:46:33,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have no idea what this anime is.

1276
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:36,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably kids watch it, I bet.

1277
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:39,129
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1279
01:46:46,034 --> 01:46:54,661

1280
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:58,824
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see how that game turns out this week.

1281
01:46:58,824 --> 01:46:59,124
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1282
01:47:00,305 --> 01:47:08,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really quickly, on a random aside, I can't believe I've never thought to do this, but just all this talk about President Cat this evening made me do this.

1283
01:47:08,627 --> 01:47:18,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know if you Google President Cat Nintendo Wii, you get this game, even though the top result is not that?

1284
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:21,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is enough out there.

1285
01:47:21,012 --> 01:47:25,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the fact that, you know, we gave it that label name Wikipedia for it.

1286
01:47:25,576 --> 01:47:32,122
[SPEAKER_03]: If you gave it President Cat Nintendo Wii, you get this game and you get all these random YouTubes related to this game.

1287
01:47:32,122 --> 01:47:36,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And then way down here, you finally get gamers looking to get this localized.

1288
01:47:36,506 --> 01:47:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the whole it was the worst selling Wii game, which, by the way,

1289
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:49,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna, I wanna point out here, and this is only from like a year ago or something, the only one I'd ever seen for sale, nobody ever fucking proved this.

1290
01:47:49,936 --> 01:47:57,080
[SPEAKER_03]: This was like an article written for one website that everybody ran with, and the proof was not exactly there.

1291
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:10,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, and you wanna go back to that thing about context and all that stuff, about, you know, getting the, actually you wanna see, they paired it with pictures of somebody doing the demo at the store, where there wasn't like really a line, or there wasn't everybody,

1292
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:14,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one store and who knew how much promotion or anything they put into it.

1293
01:48:14,792 --> 01:48:18,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody else had even said, I was there at that event.

1294
01:48:18,275 --> 01:48:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, some of the time the table was empty, but a lot of the time it was hopping over there.

1295
01:48:22,318 --> 01:48:22,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry.

1296
01:48:22,938 --> 01:48:29,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody ever proved that it sold as shitty as it did, except for the fact that you're going to tell me a game with cats doesn't is not going to sell.

1297
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1298
01:48:30,384 --> 01:48:32,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki bought like three of those copies.

1299
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,348
[SPEAKER_07]: If it really only one of them won.

1300
01:48:35,348 --> 01:48:38,931
[SPEAKER_03]: If it only sold 100 copies, how many of them were sold over here?

1301
01:48:39,824 --> 01:48:42,547
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1302
01:48:57,587 --> 01:48:58,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1303
01:49:18,697 --> 01:49:35,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, moving on, let's talk about Japanese releases, because I got distracted a little bit there with, you know, President Cat being... I was also gonna say, like, I thought it was always funny, too, that President Cat wore cat ears, even though they are cat, so that's strange.

1304
01:49:35,533 --> 01:49:38,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like wearing a mask of a human, even though I am, in fact, human.

1305
01:49:38,936 --> 01:49:39,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

1306
01:49:39,857 --> 01:49:40,097
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1307
01:49:41,278 --> 01:49:42,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1308
01:49:42,698 --> 01:50:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some releases in Japan on the Nintendo Switch this week, and no, President Cat is not one of them, but Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash is coming out in Japan this week, as well as The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered is out in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch as well.

1309
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:08,284
[SPEAKER_03]: The Enigma Machine and Alterity Experience, I'm guessing that's a combo pack game, is coming out as well.

1310
01:50:08,284 --> 01:50:10,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like it's two games in one.

1311
01:50:11,064 --> 01:50:12,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Jujutsu Kaisen Curse Clash

1312
01:50:33,566 --> 01:50:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Legacy is also out, HD remaster, on the PlayStation 5, so it's a pretty similar week between the two systems.

1313
01:50:40,948 --> 01:50:43,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I will- Holy shit.

1314
01:50:43,729 --> 01:50:47,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you that excited about Legend of Legacy, DarkSakura?

1315
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:57,033
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm looking at people selling the game for 12 grand, Rena, Wii.

1316
01:50:57,033 --> 01:50:57,333
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1317
01:50:59,983 --> 01:51:20,872
[SPEAKER_03]: some people in eat their sealed copies and then an open one is like 500 that's stupid oh my god loki you might have like stadium events sitting in your garage somewhere i don't have stadium events in my garage no but that's you that's my point you have this somewhere anyway it's not sealed though because i have opened it up but yeah

1318
01:51:22,261 --> 01:51:23,683
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

1319
01:51:40,252 --> 01:51:46,417
[SPEAKER_02]: In January, on the 30th, we have Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League Deluxe Edition for PlayStation and Xbox.

1320
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:51,921
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 31st, for the same devices, we have Arcade Game Zone.

1321
01:51:51,921 --> 01:51:57,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And then February 2nd, for PlayStation, we have Crossfire Sierra Squad.

1322
01:51:57,666 --> 01:52:03,971
[SPEAKER_02]: On PlayStation Switch and Xbox, we have Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash.

1323
01:52:03,971 --> 01:52:06,253
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Xbox Persona 3 Reload.

1324
01:52:08,295 --> 01:52:16,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And also for PlayStation and Xbox, I guess the regular version of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League.

1325
01:52:16,201 --> 01:52:16,802
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1326
01:52:17,967 --> 01:52:22,390
[SPEAKER_03]: We have just a few more stories for you and then we'll open it up to the listener roundtable.

1327
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:27,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have at least an email this week and maybe some other comments and chat and so forth.

1328
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:29,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Until we get there, let's go to Loki.

1329
01:52:29,494 --> 01:52:31,495
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of headlines for us.

1330
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:32,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1331
01:52:32,556 --> 01:52:37,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, can we get good news regarding game companies?

1332
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:42,542
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently, PUBG publisher Krafton Inc.

1333
01:52:42,542 --> 01:52:46,264
[SPEAKER_07]: has been named in a wrongful termination and sexual assault lawsuit.

1334
01:52:46,832 --> 01:52:48,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, in California.

1335
01:52:48,754 --> 01:52:50,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, because this is what happens.

1336
01:52:50,817 --> 01:52:55,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody can operate a company correctly anymore.

1337
01:52:55,643 --> 01:52:59,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so yes, rejoicing.

1338
01:52:59,548 --> 01:53:05,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know there's rejoicing but uh, you put that sound put that soundboard down and step away from the soundboard.

1339
01:53:08,135 --> 01:53:12,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so of course, you know, the representative for Crafting Inc.

1340
01:53:12,597 --> 01:53:19,401
[SPEAKER_07]: says that they're treating all allegations of improper workplace conduct with the utmost seriousness.

1341
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:20,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

1342
01:53:20,261 --> 01:53:20,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1343
01:53:20,542 --> 01:53:21,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll believe you.

1344
01:53:21,242 --> 01:53:23,083
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, whatever.

1345
01:53:23,083 --> 01:53:28,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we'll have to wait and see what's happening with some sort of lawsuit with this.

1346
01:53:28,986 --> 01:53:32,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if we will hear about this, is this going to become the next Activision Blizzard thing?

1347
01:53:32,728 --> 01:53:35,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1348
01:53:35,409 --> 01:53:36,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait and see, I guess.

1349
01:53:39,126 --> 01:53:41,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna take a step.

1350
01:53:41,288 --> 01:54:01,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna make a stab at something I'm going to try not to get ranty about it, but I'm gonna say it now Parents Teach your boys to respect women The end No arguments here Loki let's do a palette cleansing different headline, please

1351
01:54:02,558 --> 01:54:09,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth is the series biggest Steam launch ever, which is great.

1352
01:54:09,747 --> 01:54:12,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to see that it's doing well.

1353
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:16,355
[SPEAKER_03]: People in this country finally know what Yakuza is.

1354
01:54:16,355 --> 01:54:16,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1355
01:54:16,815 --> 01:54:19,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that they changed the name to Like a Dragon, everybody knows it.

1356
01:54:20,569 --> 01:54:27,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they've had peak concurrent users on that game of almost 31,000 at a time.

1357
01:54:27,976 --> 01:54:35,943
[SPEAKER_07]: The second place goes to, of course, Like a Dragon, Gaiden, the man who erased his name, which was, I think, the last release that came out.

1358
01:54:35,943 --> 01:54:37,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That was 13,000.

1359
01:54:37,104 --> 01:54:40,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And then prior to that, Yakuza Like a Dragon, which was 95,000.

1360
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:44,110
[SPEAKER_07]: 100.

1361
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going up every release like and significantly jumped up from the last one.

1362
01:54:50,335 --> 01:54:57,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I want to say maybe the last one wasn't as appealing, maybe because if it's a different time period, but certainly a threefold, 300% increase.

1363
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:03,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That game you mentioned, the one that was just under this, that was more of a bridge game.

1364
01:55:03,324 --> 01:55:09,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a short 10 hour game that bridged the story of the current protagonist and the former protagonist of the Yakuza series.

1365
01:55:09,348 --> 01:55:10,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was more of a beat him up.

1366
01:55:10,769 --> 01:55:18,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that that I think that game was kind of noticed by less people because it really served more as a kind of a bridge game.

1367
01:55:18,298 --> 01:55:19,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't technically a mainline game.

1368
01:55:19,659 --> 01:55:22,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I do need to finish like a dragon and I probably need to play this.

1369
01:55:22,803 --> 01:55:23,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks good.

1370
01:55:23,624 --> 01:55:27,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby had a lot of good things to say about it tonight on his show, and I don't doubt it's good.

1371
01:55:27,729 --> 01:55:31,132
[SPEAKER_03]: But he did also say it really does help to have played the first game.

1372
01:55:31,753 --> 01:55:32,213
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1373
01:55:51,969 --> 01:55:58,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, although last time I threatened to do that, Bobby reminded me you can watch chapter summaries in the game.

1374
01:55:58,731 --> 01:56:00,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they do have recap stuff.

1375
01:56:00,352 --> 01:56:02,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can kind of get yourself caught up on the story.

1376
01:56:02,693 --> 01:56:06,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember that I was at a point where I had to make like 3 million yen or something.

1377
01:56:06,454 --> 01:56:07,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember what it was.

1378
01:56:07,975 --> 01:56:08,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like,

1379
01:56:08,968 --> 01:56:09,028
[SPEAKER_03]: and

1380
01:56:32,361 --> 01:56:36,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm not going to drop $70 to check this game out, but I'll check it out because I have Game Pass.

1381
01:56:36,944 --> 01:56:42,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're dropping $70 on the sequel because they really enjoyed what they played.

1382
01:56:42,027 --> 01:56:42,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1383
01:56:42,227 --> 01:56:44,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's cool.

1384
01:56:44,308 --> 01:56:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1385
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:54,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby says the money gate was killer if you didn't save scum in the poker room, which I guess is a way that people get through it.

1386
01:56:54,852 --> 01:56:58,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby also says it's not just summaries, it's all the cut scenes.

1387
01:56:58,233 --> 01:57:04,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can pretty much watch the movie of Like a Dragon if I need to get caught up, which I probably will someday.

1388
01:57:04,755 --> 01:57:13,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I saw one part of the new game because Alan was calling it out on Lapin's stream.

1389
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:25,853
[SPEAKER_03]: was playing it and it was like a tinder clone type of thing where like uh there's like a little tinder mini game and he was getting all these like catfish people and it was really you know it was kind of funny but then like

1390
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimately, one of them is like a real sexy woman, but like, read like actually real, like not rendered in the game, like they somehow fused it with like, 4k footage of a real, you know, Japanese woman like being very like, you know, sexy and all that stuff.

1391
01:57:46,735 --> 01:57:50,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know that it was really funny.

1392
01:57:50,958 --> 01:57:54,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was in the same tone of a lot of

1393
01:57:55,532 --> 01:57:58,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like a dragon is where the pendulum swings hard one moment.

1394
01:57:58,914 --> 01:58:00,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very serious crime drama.

1395
01:58:00,756 --> 01:58:02,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next moment, it's a fucking cartoon.

1396
01:58:02,717 --> 01:58:03,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was one of those.

1397
01:58:03,497 --> 01:58:05,259
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking cartoon moments.

1398
01:58:05,259 --> 01:58:08,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So but that's what makes it fun.

1399
01:58:08,061 --> 01:58:08,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1400
01:58:08,901 --> 01:58:12,924
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1401
01:58:12,924 --> 01:58:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Questmaster says, Yeah, the Tinder part is great.

1402
01:58:15,566 --> 01:58:17,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby says mismatch is hilarious.

1403
01:58:17,907 --> 01:58:21,129
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually Twitch streamers.

1404
01:58:21,129 --> 01:58:22,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

1405
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:24,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Was the model at the end there a Twitch streamer?

1406
01:58:25,134 --> 01:58:37,460
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great, what a great credit if they were because that was a pretty, you know, it wasn't a long cut scene, but it was still to like have a real person in the game mixed with the, you know, rendered.

1407
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:41,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was it was one of those things where like the camera never showed them both.

1408
01:58:41,902 --> 01:58:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like your first person perspective from Ichiban's perspective, and it was all like real.

1409
01:58:46,584 --> 01:58:48,185
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting, though.

1410
01:58:49,634 --> 01:58:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1411
01:58:50,575 --> 01:58:53,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, the FMV are all streamers.

1412
01:58:53,437 --> 01:58:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: They used VTubers as their IRL selves in FMV and Like a Dragon Gaiden.

1413
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.

1414
01:58:59,321 --> 01:59:02,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And Questmaster points out all of it as optional content, but it's still hilarious.

1415
01:59:02,863 --> 01:59:04,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1416
01:59:04,144 --> 01:59:04,685
[SPEAKER_03]: These games have

1417
01:59:05,325 --> 01:59:10,228
[SPEAKER_03]: tons of optional content because the whole Sega arcade we often forget is in these games.

1418
01:59:10,228 --> 01:59:15,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's there's literally like five classic Sega games in every Yakuza game they've ever put out.

1419
01:59:15,691 --> 01:59:19,594
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always sitting here going, why did Animal Crossing strip out the Nintendo games?

1420
01:59:19,594 --> 01:59:20,835
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the best part of the game.

1421
01:59:20,835 --> 01:59:25,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, Yakuza is over here going, hello, we have classic Sega games in our games.

1422
01:59:25,798 --> 01:59:26,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1423
01:59:26,758 --> 01:59:32,282
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I remember correctly, there's like an Animal Crossing type like mini game that's in this one, too.

1424
01:59:32,662 --> 01:59:33,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, really?

1425
01:59:33,563 --> 01:59:34,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

1426
01:59:34,363 --> 01:59:35,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't there be?

1427
01:59:35,984 --> 01:59:38,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, that sounds interesting.

1428
01:59:38,446 --> 01:59:39,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1429
01:59:39,547 --> 01:59:40,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

1430
01:59:40,968 --> 01:59:41,428
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1431
01:59:41,428 --> 01:59:45,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, a good note to end on one of those games we'll get to eventually.

1432
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:49,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the listener roundtable and get your comments and perspective.

1433
01:59:49,493 --> 01:59:54,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's through our email bag, participate at Orangetrader.com is the place to send an email.

1434
01:59:54,497 --> 01:59:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can always message us in our chat as well.

1435
01:59:58,039 --> 01:59:58,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest.

1436
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:01,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really checking the social media these days.

1437
02:00:01,821 --> 02:00:05,664
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I missed a message that was kind of important by like a week.

1438
02:00:05,664 --> 02:00:10,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not really on Twitter unless a news article takes me there.

1439
02:00:10,127 --> 02:00:13,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm like, oh, OLR has an alert on the account.

1440
02:00:13,148 --> 02:00:13,589
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

1441
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:16,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we got tagged in 10 different posts about Bitcoin.

1442
02:00:16,791 --> 02:00:17,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's this one?

1443
02:00:17,871 --> 02:00:20,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is one I might want to respond to.

1444
02:00:20,733 --> 02:00:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

1445
02:00:22,414 --> 02:00:25,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, just we're not great on social media at this point.

1446
02:00:25,816 --> 02:00:28,178
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you tag me on blue sky, I'll see it like in five minutes.

1447
02:00:28,638 --> 02:00:29,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, that's where I'm at now.

1448
02:00:29,659 --> 02:00:31,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Sky is the superior location.

1449
02:00:31,722 --> 02:00:33,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I 100% agree.

1450
02:00:33,123 --> 02:00:34,004
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% agree.

1451
02:00:34,004 --> 02:00:46,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, I, I go, I look at Twitter, but I feel like the scene where Arthur and the Knights approach Camelot in Monty Python and the quest for the Holy Grail.

1452
02:00:46,979 --> 02:00:48,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not go to Twitter.

1453
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:48,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a silly place.

1454
02:00:51,963 --> 02:01:00,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And can we, by the way, can we have a moment to acknowledge and applaud that Blue Sky was mentioned at Games Done Quick and who may have been responsible for that?

1455
02:01:00,369 --> 02:01:02,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we applaud that please?

1456
02:01:02,370 --> 02:01:06,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Because yes, I agree, Blue Sky is the superior platform.

1457
02:01:06,032 --> 02:01:08,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, yes, it's missing direct messaging.

1458
02:01:08,154 --> 02:01:12,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it doesn't have video, but they have the integrated YouTube and Twitch and that stuff now.

1459
02:01:12,537 --> 02:01:13,357
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting there.

1460
02:01:13,357 --> 02:01:15,058
[SPEAKER_03]: DMs are on their roadmap and stuff.

1461
02:01:15,058 --> 02:01:21,142
[SPEAKER_03]: They are further along in the time they've been up than Twitter in its early days got, you know, so they're doing their best.

1462
02:01:23,884 --> 02:01:33,246
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says Twitter is full of anal spiders and I wonder if that's another word for antisemitic people so I can just call them anal spiders.

1463
02:01:33,246 --> 02:01:46,350
[SPEAKER_03]: He's referencing a meme that happened to discord this week because it was it was this whole back and forth about basically I said Bobby Kotick is an anal spider basically and it was it's it goes back to that 2dx song.

1464
02:01:48,164 --> 02:01:48,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1465
02:01:48,624 --> 02:01:51,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was going to say AS, you know, for both.

1466
02:01:51,366 --> 02:01:55,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm going to steal that friend for anti-Semitic people.

1467
02:01:55,208 --> 02:01:56,909
[SPEAKER_03]: You sure should.

1468
02:01:56,909 --> 02:02:01,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamas is full of anal spiders.

1469
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:04,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say on a serious note about blue sky, what makes it superior?

1470
02:02:04,633 --> 02:02:07,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, this is what people often forget.

1471
02:02:07,815 --> 02:02:14,499
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no ads and you are in complete control of your algorithm.

1472
02:02:15,399 --> 02:02:21,064
[SPEAKER_03]: That is why it is 100% better than Twitter, Facebook, threads, any of it.

1473
02:02:21,064 --> 02:02:25,727
[SPEAKER_03]: You are in control of your algorithm, and people build custom algorithms.

1474
02:02:25,727 --> 02:02:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want an algorithm that is nothing but pornography,

1475
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:31,916
[SPEAKER_03]: that exists for you.

1476
02:02:31,916 --> 02:02:38,261
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to see that and you want to if you in fact, Bobby Blackwolf made a custom feed all about Dragon Con.

1477
02:02:38,261 --> 02:02:42,945
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see every post on Blue Sky that talks about Dragon Con, Bobby made a feed for that.

1478
02:02:42,945 --> 02:02:46,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's there's also you can create your own sort of feeds that way.

1479
02:02:46,248 --> 02:02:48,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why but I was good.

1480
02:02:48,670 --> 02:02:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: But Twitter still comfortable for people because that's where Lady Gaga is and where all the newsmakers still are.

1481
02:02:54,755 --> 02:02:58,318
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand it's difficult, but it's a fucking cesspool.

1482
02:02:58,678 --> 02:02:59,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Make the switch.

1483
02:02:59,519 --> 02:03:00,840
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't regret it.

1484
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:01,601
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1485
02:03:01,601 --> 02:03:05,084
[SPEAKER_03]: The more people that make the switch, the less you'll feel that anyway.

1486
02:03:05,917 --> 02:03:08,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I have five invite codes, y'all.

1487
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:10,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have invite codes, too.

1488
02:03:10,538 --> 02:03:12,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I will pass them out like they're candy.

1489
02:03:12,598 --> 02:03:14,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody is more than welcome.

1490
02:03:14,259 --> 02:03:21,840
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're affiliated with VOG Network and you're here Sunday nights or even if you email us, get a hold of me on Discord, vognetwork.com.

1491
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:24,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all of us are oozing in invites.

1492
02:03:24,381 --> 02:03:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the invite wall is very easy to get around at this point, but it still is very effective at keeping bots and spammers out.

1493
02:03:31,562 --> 02:03:34,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not perfect because people foolishly post their codes on Twitter.

1494
02:03:35,503 --> 02:03:39,024
[SPEAKER_03]: without, you know, doing something to redact it and bots pick it up.

1495
02:03:39,024 --> 02:03:43,106
[SPEAKER_03]: But it certainly slows it way the fuck down.

1496
02:03:43,106 --> 02:03:46,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually hope Blue Sky just stays invite only permanently.

1497
02:03:46,267 --> 02:03:48,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not hard to get on if you just ask.

1498
02:03:48,928 --> 02:03:50,028
[SPEAKER_03]: All the cool kids are.

1499
02:03:50,028 --> 02:03:50,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1500
02:03:50,848 --> 02:03:52,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So but come to.

1501
02:03:52,029 --> 02:03:52,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be shy.

1502
02:03:52,569 --> 02:03:54,110
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be one of us.

1503
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:56,130
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1504
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:57,471
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1505
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:59,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of one of us emails, right.

1506
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:02,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send us an email.

1507
02:04:02,332 --> 02:04:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe we have at least one tonight.

1508
02:04:04,827 --> 02:04:06,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one.

1509
02:04:06,328 --> 02:04:10,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to make sure the other one wasn't old one because someone doesn't clean out the mailbox.

1510
02:04:10,651 --> 02:04:12,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It all gets forwarded to my other email.

1511
02:04:15,663 --> 02:04:17,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, peoples!

1512
02:04:17,344 --> 02:04:32,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I have been slowly following the online Discord about PalWorld, both because I've been on my ski staycation 2024 for the past two weeks, and because I honestly do not care.

1513
02:04:32,276 --> 02:04:41,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Between me catching up on Checkpoint, part of the Loading Ready Live universe, and other online gaming things, I still am not motivated to care.

1514
02:04:41,903 --> 02:04:43,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So, should I?

1515
02:04:43,564 --> 02:04:46,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, should I or anyone else care about Pal World?

1516
02:04:46,905 --> 02:04:57,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I am someone who is delving into my back catalogue to the point that the games I'm currently playing are Jeanne d'Arc on PSP and Dragon Age

1517
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:02,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mean Inquisition instead of Insurrection?

1518
02:05:02,572 --> 02:05:06,573
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, should I or anyone else care?

1519
02:05:06,573 --> 02:05:08,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay care, Red Retainment.

1520
02:05:08,314 --> 02:05:14,837
[SPEAKER_02]: This message has been brought to you by those mustaches the members of the elite are wearing for some yet to be explained reason.

1521
02:05:14,837 --> 02:05:15,457
[SPEAKER_02]: You see.

1522
02:05:15,457 --> 02:05:16,478
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't care.

1523
02:05:16,478 --> 02:05:22,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, what happened is he was playing Dragon Age Inquisition while he was watching Star Trek Insurrection.

1524
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes these things happen.

1525
02:05:23,821 --> 02:05:25,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's all.

1526
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:27,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't you don't you don't have to care.

1527
02:05:28,507 --> 02:05:29,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not great.

1528
02:05:29,048 --> 02:05:30,869
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to care.

1529
02:05:30,869 --> 02:05:33,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you should have us answer this question for you.

1530
02:05:33,592 --> 02:05:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm very flattered that we would answer this question for you.

1531
02:05:36,715 --> 02:05:37,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you should.

1532
02:05:37,336 --> 02:05:39,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you should care about our opinion or anyone else's.

1533
02:05:39,137 --> 02:05:41,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said he doesn't have to.

1534
02:05:41,079 --> 02:05:44,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm saying Reddertainment doesn't need to listen to you.

1535
02:05:44,022 --> 02:05:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do what you want.

1536
02:05:44,623 --> 02:05:45,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an adult.

1537
02:05:45,724 --> 02:05:46,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1538
02:05:46,224 --> 02:05:47,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an adult.

1539
02:05:47,506 --> 02:05:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, here's the thing.

1540
02:05:49,187 --> 02:05:51,449
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone over the- You can have cake for breakfast.

1541
02:05:51,449 --> 02:05:52,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an adult.

1542
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:52,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1543
02:05:53,291 --> 02:06:00,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You can steal Pokemon and make your own game and suffer the possible legal repercussions of that.

1544
02:06:00,694 --> 02:06:02,675
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a fucking adult.

1545
02:06:02,675 --> 02:06:05,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1546
02:06:05,136 --> 02:06:06,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I mean on a serious note.

1547
02:06:06,076 --> 02:06:08,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like putting on your underwear, you know?

1548
02:06:08,757 --> 02:06:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you put some on, it's fine and it's clean, but like...

1549
02:06:14,463 --> 02:06:16,424
[SPEAKER_02]: No one needs to know what color your underwear on.

1550
02:06:16,424 --> 02:06:20,846
[SPEAKER_02]: If you care enough to pick out a specific color and make of your underwear, then that's up to you.

1551
02:06:20,846 --> 02:06:22,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't all have to know about it.

1552
02:06:22,167 --> 02:06:23,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jamie, a lot of guys don't.

1553
02:06:23,928 --> 02:06:25,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's also up to you.

1554
02:06:25,849 --> 02:06:27,830
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a personal choice.

1555
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:31,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just don't don't ask me what underwear you should put on today.

1556
02:06:31,172 --> 02:06:32,452
[SPEAKER_03]: You make that decision.

1557
02:06:32,452 --> 02:06:33,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1558
02:06:33,233 --> 02:06:38,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I do have to explain to SSJ 100 Matt about cake for breakfast.

1559
02:06:38,195 --> 02:06:42,838
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved out here and I had cake for breakfast, I took a picture of it, sent it to my mother and said, I'm an adult.

1560
02:06:44,807 --> 02:06:49,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, I do want to, Rentertainment's been listening for a long time and I don't want to make it sound like I'm mocking.

1561
02:06:49,988 --> 02:06:53,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's nice that somebody would ask this question somewhere.

1562
02:06:53,669 --> 02:06:54,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1563
02:06:54,689 --> 02:06:58,450
[SPEAKER_03]: We did, we talked about all the discourse trademarked and all that stuff earlier in the show.

1564
02:06:58,450 --> 02:07:02,751
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, I feel like you should have some type of inclination.

1565
02:07:02,751 --> 02:07:04,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this game for you or not?

1566
02:07:04,511 --> 02:07:07,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And the biggest thing is you, you heard me say it.

1567
02:07:07,692 --> 02:07:14,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a survival game, but the dinosaurs from Ark were replaced with Pachymon.

1568
02:07:17,609 --> 02:07:22,010
[SPEAKER_03]: legally distinct, question mark, to be determined, Pokemon.

1569
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:25,971
[SPEAKER_03]: If that sounds like a game that's of interest to you, sure, put it on your radar.

1570
02:07:25,971 --> 02:07:31,152
[SPEAKER_03]: If it sounds like, wow, I hate survival games, you know what, there's like 10 other games that came out this week.

1571
02:07:31,152 --> 02:07:34,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby would prefer that you play Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, quite frankly.

1572
02:07:34,973 --> 02:07:37,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like Jamie would as well.

1573
02:07:37,594 --> 02:07:37,734
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1574
02:07:39,655 --> 02:07:56,990
[SPEAKER_03]: You really kind of have to decide on your own merits and don't let anyone, us, Twitter, Blue Sky, TV, YouTubes, TikToks, don't let anyone make those decisions for you.

1575
02:07:56,990 --> 02:08:01,174
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1576
02:08:01,174 --> 02:08:03,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to have cake for cake for breakfast, do it.

1577
02:08:03,316 --> 02:08:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1578
02:08:06,098 --> 02:08:06,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1579
02:08:08,692 --> 02:08:10,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what your undies preferences are, just saying.

1580
02:08:27,555 --> 02:08:28,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Bucket of Coffee

1581
02:08:49,517 --> 02:09:00,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mantis.com is still looking like some, uh, uh, uh, Comic Sans GeoShitties realness on here.

1582
02:09:00,070 --> 02:09:05,076
[SPEAKER_02]: The site is still there.

1583
02:09:05,076 --> 02:09:05,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1584
02:09:05,276 --> 02:09:05,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get your Mantis.

1585
02:09:07,205 --> 02:09:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to change the subject and go to chat and see if there's anything that you want to ask us about or talk about, preferably in gaming and not, you know, in the underwear section at Target.

1586
02:09:19,268 --> 02:09:23,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, something you want to ask us about.

1587
02:09:23,109 --> 02:09:27,310
[SPEAKER_03]: SSG100 Matt says, I heard there's a game called Tunic that folks should play.

1588
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:32,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think that's a reference to a Redertainment's question there about should I play Powerworld?

1589
02:09:32,592 --> 02:09:33,352
[SPEAKER_03]: No, play Tunic.

1590
02:09:34,554 --> 02:09:35,755
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's good.

1591
02:09:35,755 --> 02:09:36,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the recommendation.

1592
02:09:36,555 --> 02:09:37,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Tunic's pretty good.

1593
02:09:37,676 --> 02:09:39,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So Red Entertainment, maybe I will.

1594
02:09:39,137 --> 02:09:40,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I will hear your question.

1595
02:09:40,098 --> 02:09:44,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say no, play Tunic.

1596
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:47,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can I can already see next next week's email.

1597
02:09:47,923 --> 02:09:48,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I already played Tunic.

1598
02:09:48,963 --> 02:09:52,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what do I do?

1599
02:09:52,966 --> 02:09:57,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've already been to heaven and after five minutes, I was like, let's go.

1600
02:09:57,909 --> 02:10:00,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You could also do you know how I make decisions on a lot of games?

1601
02:10:01,437 --> 02:10:16,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch my friends play them on Twitch television or YouTube or wherever you know they happen to be streaming and stuff because I find that like watching real people play the games and get those impressions oftentimes helps me understand the game a lot better than a

1602
02:10:17,436 --> 02:10:21,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Selectively targeted kind of advertisement trailers.

1603
02:10:21,957 --> 02:10:27,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know have a bunch of pre-rendered stuff in it, you know, or even the review stuff is sometimes very limited to craft a certain narrative.

1604
02:10:27,959 --> 02:10:34,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like just watching a clip of somebody playing the real deal, you know, and that's how I inform a lot of my decisions.

1605
02:10:34,141 --> 02:10:41,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So Red Entertainment, if you're looking for something to play, what are your what are the cool people on Twitch playing right now that you like to follow?

1606
02:10:41,403 --> 02:10:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be another one.

1607
02:10:42,343 --> 02:10:43,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And this goes for anybody.

1608
02:10:43,443 --> 02:10:46,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep picking on Red Entertainment because the email, but they don't play Pizza Tower.

1609
02:10:47,885 --> 02:11:00,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Pizza Tower is basically a spiritual successor to WarioWoods, but it's not.

1610
02:11:00,251 --> 02:11:02,752
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that the gameplay is similar to a Wario game.

1611
02:11:10,723 --> 02:11:16,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that Alan Wake is coming out next week in DBD, the new Survivor.

1612
02:11:16,966 --> 02:11:23,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played DBD since... And all the nerfs!

1613
02:11:23,268 --> 02:11:25,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing killer tonight, so we'll see what happens.

1614
02:11:25,749 --> 02:11:27,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how it goes.

1615
02:11:27,630 --> 02:11:30,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

1616
02:11:35,337 --> 02:11:36,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1617
02:11:36,538 --> 02:11:42,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I saw there's like one of the things talking about the layoffs at Microsoft.

1618
02:11:42,441 --> 02:11:52,306
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about that their console division, that the folks responsible for bringing more physical releases out into the retail space have been laid off.

1619
02:11:52,306 --> 02:11:54,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if that necessarily means anything.

1620
02:11:55,327 --> 02:11:55,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1621
02:11:55,747 --> 02:12:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it does, because we had a story last week about Walmart pulling back on the Xbox physical releases.

1622
02:12:02,453 --> 02:12:07,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if there isn't something to that, which is, again, a sad like physical.

1623
02:12:07,156 --> 02:12:18,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like a lot of like even when I go down the aisles like for video games and stuff like that nowadays, I go every week at the Target and yeah, it is looking pretty pathetic.

1624
02:12:18,606 --> 02:12:20,047
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's it's not like it's

1625
02:12:21,601 --> 02:12:22,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Pass.

1626
02:12:47,165 --> 02:13:08,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, they want you on Game Pass, but it's not like one of those things where you're going to lose your purchases going to the next platform, like, you know, say with Nintendo and like the Switch, for example, like even with the PlayStation 5, you still have access to your PlayStation 4 games and maybe 3 if those are compatible or whatever.

1627
02:13:08,983 --> 02:13:12,146
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I could see like people being certainly comfortable with digital games.

1628
02:13:12,146 --> 02:13:13,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I am on PC.

1629
02:13:13,707 --> 02:13:15,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I remember back in the day, I was like, oh,

1630
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:17,060
[SPEAKER_07]: No way.

1631
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:20,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got over that really fast.

1632
02:13:20,542 --> 02:13:22,063
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a little different, though.

1633
02:13:22,063 --> 02:13:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm not worried about those libraries going away.

1634
02:13:24,664 --> 02:13:35,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And that stuff, once again, as you go along and get new hardware or get a new PC or whatever the case may be, you're still going to have that library that follows with you.

1635
02:13:35,389 --> 02:13:44,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the most part, those should all still play very well on your new hardware, assuming that the game is not super duper old, in which

1636
02:13:45,393 --> 02:13:50,759
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and even then, like, there's some workarounds for that, but I don't know.

1637
02:13:50,759 --> 02:14:00,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have that whole article or the whole thing about Ubisoft saying that, like, people need to start getting used to not owning their games or whatever the case may be.

1638
02:14:00,231 --> 02:14:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was, like, sort of taken out of context.

1639
02:14:02,273 --> 02:14:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Attacked, by the way.

1640
02:14:04,235 --> 02:14:04,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1641
02:14:06,536 --> 02:14:18,249
[SPEAKER_07]: but it like I don't know necessarily that people are not used to owning their games but like in the sense that I think they're saying not owning physical media or something like that.

1642
02:14:18,249 --> 02:14:19,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1643
02:14:19,090 --> 02:14:19,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what happens.

1644
02:14:19,911 --> 02:14:22,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the companies are gonna do what they want to do.

1645
02:14:22,253 --> 02:14:23,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We just either support it or don't.

1646
02:14:29,233 --> 02:14:38,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster says if you don't like POW World but like another survival sim with fantasy trappings, Enshrouded just came out and is apparently very good.

1647
02:14:55,109 --> 02:15:00,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably like first week sale and then it goes up to $29.99, which ironically is the same price of PowerWorld.

1648
02:15:00,532 --> 02:15:04,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's going up in a couple of days.

1649
02:15:04,194 --> 02:15:05,034
[SPEAKER_03]: SGO 100.

1650
02:15:05,034 --> 02:15:08,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt reminds us Tekken 8 also came out this week.

1651
02:15:08,056 --> 02:15:09,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Crazy amount of games.

1652
02:15:09,877 --> 02:15:10,557
[SPEAKER_07]: $70 game, that one.

1653
02:15:10,557 --> 02:15:11,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Art named PowerWorld.

1654
02:15:12,358 --> 02:15:16,860
[SPEAKER_03]: E3VL reminds me of one I wanted to still check out too, but it also kind of has a high price tag.

1655
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:21,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown, which is like that Prince of Persia, Metroidvania type of game.

1656
02:15:21,641 --> 02:15:23,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted to check that game out.

1657
02:15:23,322 --> 02:15:23,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Fail.

1658
02:15:23,842 --> 02:15:25,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait for a fail for that one.

1659
02:15:25,283 --> 02:15:28,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of thinking the Ubisoft games tend to end up on Game Pass.

1660
02:15:28,144 --> 02:15:29,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm probably just kind of waiting for that.

1661
02:15:29,484 --> 02:15:32,525
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'd like to check that game out at some point for sure.

1662
02:15:32,525 --> 02:15:37,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially since, you know, they don't like you owning your game.

1663
02:15:37,107 --> 02:15:40,948
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, pay them less money if possible.

1664
02:15:42,011 --> 02:15:48,493
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, with all that, it's about time to wrap up tonight's show and head on out for next week.

1665
02:15:48,493 --> 02:15:51,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank everybody here at the end of show for listening to the show.

1666
02:15:51,594 --> 02:15:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: If you enjoyed what you heard here, whether it was live or on the podcast feed, help us spread the word.

1667
02:15:55,635 --> 02:15:59,356
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.

1668
02:15:59,356 --> 02:16:00,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell a friend or two about the show.

1669
02:16:01,677 --> 02:16:09,982
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice 5-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way in helping to get the word out about this show.

1670
02:16:09,982 --> 02:16:17,467
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, speaking of iTunes, very random sort of aside, but this discussion came up on Discord and I did have to sign in and agree to it.

1671
02:16:17,467 --> 02:16:25,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, based on what I'm agreeing to, Apple's going to start offering transcriptions of the show, basically live, like as you listen.

1672
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:28,554
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1673
02:16:46,127 --> 02:16:53,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Assumably is coming soon based on the fact that I just agreed to the fact that if we put a thing in the store, we're having it transcribed.

1674
02:16:53,312 --> 02:16:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but you know, people have been asking for that for a long time.

1675
02:16:57,895 --> 02:17:01,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was, it was expensive to do.

1676
02:17:01,157 --> 02:17:06,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we looked into it and it was too, unfortunately, as you all know, we really don't make a lot of money off this.

1677
02:17:06,481 --> 02:17:08,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You all are very kind with your bits and your subs.

1678
02:17:08,762 --> 02:17:09,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We do appreciate it.

1679
02:17:09,763 --> 02:17:12,345
[SPEAKER_03]: That helps keep VOG Network a legitimate business.

1680
02:17:12,885 --> 02:17:16,306
[SPEAKER_03]: and helps us do the occasional promo at a convention or something like that.

1681
02:17:16,306 --> 02:17:19,988
[SPEAKER_03]: But pretty much all of that goes right into the cost of running a business.

1682
02:17:19,988 --> 02:17:24,329
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't like get to spend it on fun stuff.

1683
02:17:24,329 --> 02:17:28,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, just, you know, that's cool.

1684
02:17:28,531 --> 02:17:32,372
[SPEAKER_03]: The transcription is coming and will help more people discover the show.

1685
02:17:32,372 --> 02:17:38,774
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DarkSakura, we'll go ahead and say bye bye to you as I know you've got your stream you're going to do and all that stuff.

1686
02:17:38,774 --> 02:17:40,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Any final words or final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1687
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I just still want to encourage everybody to fact check anything that you read on your social media and bring them home.

1688
02:17:54,713 --> 02:17:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1689
02:17:56,213 --> 02:17:56,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night, DarkSakura.

1690
02:17:56,994 --> 02:17:57,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good stream.

1691
02:17:57,894 --> 02:17:58,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1692
02:17:58,194 --> 02:18:00,075
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

1693
02:18:00,075 --> 02:18:03,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, that takes us to you and your final thought tonight.

1694
02:18:03,216 --> 02:18:07,237
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I got to spend the week editing and then designing.

1695
02:18:08,186 --> 02:18:09,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1696
02:18:09,187 --> 02:18:10,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Never ends.

1697
02:18:10,027 --> 02:18:11,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Never ends.

1698
02:18:11,909 --> 02:18:17,113
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I have like three more weeks until my cruise and I am maybe four.

1699
02:18:17,113 --> 02:18:19,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost count, but I'm really excited.

1700
02:18:19,394 --> 02:18:20,335
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

1701
02:18:20,335 --> 02:18:21,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting closer.

1702
02:18:21,156 --> 02:18:22,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It's less than 30 days away.

1703
02:18:22,276 --> 02:18:26,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really fucking excited because I don't think we're going to go in 2025.

1704
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:31,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is going to be the last one for a little bit so that we can travel to other places, too.

1705
02:18:31,243 --> 02:18:31,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to.

1706
02:18:31,843 --> 02:18:34,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want to go to Europe and see the Abba show one of these days.

1707
02:18:35,586 --> 02:18:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days.

1708
02:18:36,126 --> 02:18:38,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, have a great week, everybody.

1709
02:18:38,028 --> 02:18:41,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time in seven days to do it all over again.

1710
02:18:41,591 --> 02:18:45,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for taking time out to listen to Orange Launch Radio, whether it was live or on the podcast feed.

1711
02:18:45,974 --> 02:18:48,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We just appreciate you being here and supporting us.

1712
02:18:48,616 --> 02:18:53,240
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back next week to do it all again as we inch closer and closer to Episode 1000.

1713
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:57,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And people keep asking, do you have anything special planned for Episode 1000?

1714
02:18:57,123 --> 02:18:59,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And my answer is no.

1715
02:19:02,526 --> 02:19:11,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1716
02:19:11,293 --> 02:19:16,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1717
02:19:16,417 --> 02:19:24,164
[SPEAKER_06]: To join us for our live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

1718
02:19:25,242 --> 02:19:34,777
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
