1
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy 2024!

2
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:20,296
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first week of 2024, and I don't want to admit how many times I've still written 2023, and this is also Take 5 because I can't say 2024 three times in this part correctly.

3
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:21,477
[SPEAKER_05]: What's gonna happen this year?

4
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:23,058
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think I am, a precog?

5
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:29,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawsuits, acquisitions, studio closures, studio openings, studio revivals, and most importantly, new game releases!

6
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the well-obviously intro.

7
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:37,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to catch up and get the new year stories rolling, starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:49,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week, another year if you will, of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:58,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio back at you live once again with episode number 988 of our show for tonight, January the 7th of 2024.

10
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:07,071
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm back after a little bit of a holiday break here at OLR with my co-host.

11
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:12,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello first and foremost to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:13,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

13
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, hello.

14
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:14,675
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

15
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:15,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy New Year.

16
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your New Year?

17
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:24,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty uneventful, just ill and then going right on back to work.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

19
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:29,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, um, it is what it is.

20
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:34,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at getting myself a new Mac mini soon.

21
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:39,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I got a new Apple watch because of some weird legislation issues going on.

22
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:48,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, um, there was a, like a, a lawsuit about the, uh, O2 sensor.

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

24
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about this or like they had to pull it from official store.

25
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that way lasted like two days though.

26
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:59,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the- It did, but I jumped and bought mine before all that went down.

27
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed one anyway.

28
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,709
[SPEAKER_02]: My Series 4 wasn't, you know, lasting very long.

29
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,771
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if anyone wants to buy an Apple Watch Series 4, let me know.

30
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh,

31
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:23,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went forward and I got Dan an Apple TV so he could have his Dolby sound and actually use our surround sound system.

32
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:25,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought each other a lot of Transformers.

33
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:31,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, I guess I should check in on what gaming things people got or bought or otherwise for the holidays.

34
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,962
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have that Apple TV and the sound system and all that stuff.

35
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:37,883
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds cool.

36
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:39,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something I'll share in a minute, but go ahead.

37
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:43,852
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt said that my VTuber got a tan.

38
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:44,593
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she didn't.

39
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:48,097
[SPEAKER_02]: She actually has ferret coloring very subtly.

40
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:49,598
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a ferret furry.

41
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you want to see the video of the show, I would invite you or chat along with us as SSJ100 Matt is.

42
00:02:55,044 --> 00:03:02,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I invite you to participate live because we do tape live every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voicing Geeks Network.

43
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:06,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

44
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:18,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Bobby Blackwolf, he's actually not going to be here next week because he has this side gig at a little convention online streaming thing called Awesome Games Done Quick.

45
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,837
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he's going to be working at that convention next.

46
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:26,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he actually isn't working on Sunday, but you know, he has to travel, get settled in and all that good stuff.

47
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,839
[SPEAKER_07]: He talked about some of the stuff he is tentatively set to host.

48
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, they can potentially change anything right up to the last minute.

49
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:37,444
[SPEAKER_07]: So tentatively, he's supposed to be hosting, you know, doing the announcing.

50
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,585
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not actually playing, okay?

51
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,906
[SPEAKER_07]: That's somebody else very good at the video game.

52
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:46,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby is announcing, reading donations, you know, keeping that sort of thing moving.

53
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:53,933
[SPEAKER_07]: For Bomb Rush Cyberfunk on Thursday night, which I thought was awesome, because if you don't know that one, that's like the Jet Set Radio future kind of like spiritual successor game.

54
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:54,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Lies of P

55
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:25,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, anyway, let me of course introduce our other host, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

56
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:25,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

57
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Loki, how are you?

58
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:27,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

59
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:29,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm multitasking as usual.

60
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:30,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Multitasking?

61
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,046
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

62
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:32,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you editing a video?

63
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:33,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Your latest Minecraft video in the background?

64
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:34,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what else are you doing?

65
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I should be.

66
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I should be doing that.

67
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,712
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just posting on Twitter.

68
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,734
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just... Yeah, I should be editing.

69
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:43,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I really should be.

70
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:48,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like three different things, like three quarters of the way done.

71
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,399
[SPEAKER_06]: type of thing.

72
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I did film the last part of the Raise Works stuff, so I've been procrastinating on that.

73
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just stacking content.

74
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:00,905
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the plan.

75
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:14,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the plan was like, yeah, okay, I'll just have this ready to go, this will be all done, and I'll just put it out, and then that way I can take more time on this, and then there's something else new that came up, so now I'm playing that, and it's like, you know, what am I gonna do?

76
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:19,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, speaking of like, you know, recording videos and stuff.

77
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:30,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know, I've been kind of screwing around on YouTube, but it's very like all the YouTubes I've been doing lately are like gameplay only I don't talk over them, which for anybody that knows me knows that I am demonstrating great restraint by not talking over videos.

78
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:34,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been working a lot to figure this out.

79
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:38,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually I finally I think crack the code because I'm able to do 4k gameplay videos now.

80
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:50,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've actually, I, you know, did some research, some forums, checking with other people that, you know, were in similar boats and situations, because I was trying to record, ironically, Dead by Daylight off PlayStation 5.

81
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:56,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, I got the version of PlayStation Plus that has like the game library.

82
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of those games was Dead by Daylight.

83
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:06,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Oh, I could go in and like record myself getting adept trophies, like, you know, just, you know, not all of them, because I'm not going to buy all the DLC.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,200
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, you know,

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:26,484
[SPEAKER_07]: the core four and the other characters that come free with it now like because I think David King is like part of the base pack now they don't sell you know him as DLC is just included with the game now so get that get the adept with the low hanging fruit so to speak the first video I did where I was trying to do adept Dwight didn't work the 4k was terrible

86
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:35,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did some research, da da da, and I put it to use with a 4K Claudette video, which I got adept on because we had a killer that basically was not doing anything.

87
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will be the first to admit, it's not the most interesting video in the world.

88
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:41,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very WTF, like, what is this ho doing?

89
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:42,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Like type of thing.

90
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:46,797
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I started doing some Final Fantasy XIV 4K videos.

91
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:49,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, oh, this is great that I can do this now.

92
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:53,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try to put more 4K gameplay videos up on YouTube because there's some

93
00:06:54,522 --> 00:06:55,903
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's not a ton.

94
00:06:55,903 --> 00:07:08,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of the stuff that's up there is people yapping over it going, don't forget to like, comment, subscribe to my channel and like all that crap that I just I just I want somebody to be able to have chill vibes on YouTube.

95
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what I think a lot of people do.

96
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:12,718
[SPEAKER_07]: They set YouTube on in the background and just let it run.

97
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:13,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

98
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,080
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's what I'm making.

99
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, yeah.

100
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:22,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, um, but back to podcasting and what we're doing here live on Sunday night.

101
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:27,233
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some folks in chat saying SSJ 100 Mats is 2024 the year of episode 1000.

102
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:27,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

103
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:28,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

104
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:33,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Mike Def says OLR will be doing awesome podcasting done at a normal pace.

105
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:41,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for saying that we'll, we'll try our best, but for those that might be new to Orange Launch Radio, because it is a new year, uh, new year, same us, uh,

106
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:46,607
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR has existed since 2002 as a live internet program.

107
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:53,610
[SPEAKER_07]: The three of us, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, we all met playing a game called Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade.

108
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that game with the arrows that has been mocked in pop culture, media, and praised many, many, many times.

109
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,334
[SPEAKER_06]: They moved on.

110
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,335
[SPEAKER_06]: They're mocking older games now.

111
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, now they're mocking Tetris, but we'll get to that.

112
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:17,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all met playing that and going to, and so we wanted to do like a live community show to talk about like DDR tournaments and the whole thing that, you know, we were doing.

113
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And HotPocketry in our chat, I like that name, asked, met IRL.

114
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:27,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we all, we all actually, we all met in person at the arcade.

115
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:30,404
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is arcades are all ticket spitting machines.

116
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:34,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this story would not happen in 2024 because arcades don't have

117
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:35,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Boutique Arcade

118
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's not your typical arcade.

119
00:08:54,463 --> 00:08:57,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very themed thing to attract different types of people.

120
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, we could still have that story in a place like that.

121
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,849
[SPEAKER_07]: But now like Golf Land and that whole thing?

122
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:05,051
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we could, we would never meet in a place like that now.

123
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:10,735
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but you know, we we all met each other and enjoyed playing together.

124
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:21,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And ultimately, we stopped playing as much DDR because they weren't putting it out as much, you know, other companies started making huge music games, you know, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, hello,

125
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_07]: so we just we we've kind of discovered and realized we love music games but we love music games because we actually love video games and our love of music games is a part of that so now we talk about all video games and later tonight we're going to talk about we have a story about DarkSakura one of her all-time favorite video games i don't know if it's well no i know yeah the guardian legend

126
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:46,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I know

127
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:06,315
[SPEAKER_07]: and more.

128
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:45,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so apparently a 13-year-old competitive Tetris player that goes by the name BlueScooty became the first person, or human, because it's been done in TASes before, to get to the NES classic kill screen on the NES, or the Tetris on the NES, the kill screen on that.

129
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:55,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of, I think, based off of some of the videos and stuff I've watched about it, there's a lot of dodging different crashes in the game because of that.

130
00:10:55,982 --> 00:11:05,111
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were able to basically max out the score, max out a lot of the pieces dropped, and then it just came down to the game just doesn't function anymore.

131
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty impressive.

132
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:11,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching the palette switches is just nuts.

133
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:17,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It is somewhat the equivalent of the 256 board in Pac-Man and that infamous kill screen.

134
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

135
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not one for one.

136
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:29,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the techies, but like the best way to explain it is that it is a kill screen because of the limitations of older gaming media similar to Pac-Man and the 256 board.

137
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:32,890
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the media has been reporting this as he beat the game.

138
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to diminish his accomplishments.

139
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:40,457
[SPEAKER_07]: He bested the game, I think is probably a better term to use.

140
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:41,958
[SPEAKER_07]: He bested Tetris.

141
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:52,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the funny thing is, you may or may not recall, and I don't expect the folks talking about this on NBC to know about this, but that old Tetris cartridge had two modes.

142
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:57,112
[SPEAKER_07]: There was mode A and mode B and mode B I think was this mode that was endless.

143
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have them backwards.

144
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time.

145
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Mode B was the one that was endless.

146
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:08,723
[SPEAKER_07]: But there actually was a mode A where once you cleared, I think it was 100 lines, you beat it, you actually did beat the game.

147
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:11,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tetris was never unbeatable.

148
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:15,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just this particular endless mode.

149
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:20,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a way to beat 8-bit Tetris on the NES.

150
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:33,661
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember you get that screen at the end that shows, I think the original NES version showed like the Russian iconic architecture and things like that on the screen and the more levels, the higher level you started on, the more of it you would see.

151
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:37,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember there's actually, everybody talks about Tetris on the NES.

152
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:41,027
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a, I think it was on the Advance or maybe the DS, I think it was Tetris DS.

153
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:44,488
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya says the Russian dancers were the Tengen version

154
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:18,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to minimize the awesome accomplishment of this kid, I just think maybe the lingo that is being used may actually not really reflect what he did in this.

155
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:21,746
[SPEAKER_07]: He bested the programming structure of Tetris.

156
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,128
[SPEAKER_07]: That is still a huge accomplishment.

157
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:30,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry, Loki, but I just... That was one of those weird things where I was like, I don't... I think when they say he beat Tetris, it's not really the right words.

158
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

159
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:34,064
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft

160
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been, was that that late?

161
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it was later 80.

162
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the NES itself.

163
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:56,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was it was because it Tetris NES didn't really come out to the Game Boy version had come out and the Game Boy was around like 89, I want to say.

164
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,951
[SPEAKER_07]: So somebody in chat can fact check me on it.

165
00:13:58,951 --> 00:13:59,431
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

166
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:03,995
[SPEAKER_07]: But even it, whether it's 89 or 86, my point still stands.

167
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is nobody until now, 2024, has ever bested Tetris.

168
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, a robot did it.

169
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But we certainly recognize no human

170
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:21,928
[SPEAKER_07]: has ever done this until now, and now a 13 year old kid did this.

171
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,489
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

172
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what an accomplishment for that kid to have done this.

173
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know.

174
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:39,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, to celebrate it, we should just tell them that they're all their choices in life are wrong and that they should go outside because, you know, that that's what you do as a professional.

175
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:39,704
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

176
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:48,935
[SPEAKER_06]: news program is you just like let me tell you my outdated thoughts please let me share those with my entire audience

177
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:55,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So those of you that follow gaming on social media, I'm sure know exactly what Loki is referencing.

178
00:14:55,541 --> 00:15:09,591
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't, and I don't blame you, what he's referencing is that there was a Sky News report where the anchor woman made kind of an offhanded comment at the end about, I don't really want to get this quote wrong, but I'm going to paraphrase that as the end.

179
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,412
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, maybe he should go outside or something like that.

180
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:17,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people- No, I thought it was like something worse than that, but like, yeah, I don't know.

181
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:36,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to find maybe I'll find the clip or something and play it here just so I can I can Report on it accurately I suppose but a lot of people are taking very very very negatively to this clip because and I I don't I don't I understand why

182
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:38,629
[SPEAKER_07]: EA wouldn't do that.

183
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:11,896
[SPEAKER_07]: But people have a very knee-jerk reaction to this stuff.

184
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:15,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very, like, we're sick and tired of being bullied.

185
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, or it's that same thing where, like, the academic decathlon kids—this was the thing at my school, in high school—the academic decathlon kids were winning fucking championships and were never being praised.

186
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:35,316
[SPEAKER_07]: by the student body, the way the football team, which couldn't win a fucking game to save their life was consistently.

187
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:40,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a lot of us now are becoming of that age where we recognize like this is just a lot of bullshit.

188
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So to hear somebody say this just really sucked.

189
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:45,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I did find the clip.

190
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:53,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to play this and just to clear ourselves, I am playing a clip here from Sky News for the purposes of commentary and all that good stuff.

191
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: and sorry to my co-hosts they won't hear it.

192
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:17,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you read stuff off a teleprompter, you know, is that a life goal of yours?

193
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:19,099
[SPEAKER_06]: To read words off a teleprompter?

194
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we should be telling anybody what their life goal ought to be.

195
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:22,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

196
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:37,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just, you know, Tetris, again, a 13 year old did something on an intellectual level no human being has done in 35-ish years.

197
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that newsworthy?

198
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:40,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

199
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And she says she's a mother, so feels sorry for her kids.

200
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, clearly that makes her opinion more important then.

201
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:47,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

202
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:51,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but can you imagine like, hey, mom, I did this really great thing.

203
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:56,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, you know, why don't you try becoming a doctor or something, you know, something that the world actually appreciates.

204
00:17:56,997 --> 00:18:00,740
[SPEAKER_06]: because what your accomplishment is just not.

205
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:08,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so I'm not going to give in to the people the mentality people expect from gamers and call her names.

206
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:12,247
[SPEAKER_07]: All I'm going to say is that was a very disappointing reaction.

207
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:20,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a mother, you should know better than to say that about a child when the entire country is watching you.

208
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just that's how I feel.

209
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:24,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

210
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:25,742
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a bully.

211
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:26,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing more.

212
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:27,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

213
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:27,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

214
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:29,264
[SPEAKER_07]: That comment was very... Anyway.

215
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:30,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't... That's... Okay.

216
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just gonna say that happened.

217
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want that to deflect from the accomplishments of what this kid did.

218
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:43,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now, you know, now that we know this is possible and, you know, there's... We knew that there was a assisted speedrun and stuff.

219
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:48,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how many people are going to try to emulate this now and also try to get the kill screen.

220
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that became all the rage once somebody finally did it on Pac-Man Get the 256 board.

221
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:58,114
[SPEAKER_07]: was that now everybody wanted to get the 256 board and crash the game.

222
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:08,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting to see how many other people try to kill, using my quotey fingers, in the game sense, Tetris in the in the coming weeks and months and year.

223
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:10,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

224
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:16,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Fifth Dream is now asking, is it possible to do that faster?

225
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:19,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really good question.

226
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

227
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:24,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you would be talking like milliseconds.

228
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:35,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I want to say there was something about he made a, he actually made a boo-boo because as Loki was saying, you have to get a certain combination of lines in order to overflow the memory.

229
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:38,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually don't want to always get Tetrises.

230
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,936
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a point where you want to get a single.

231
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe when you're supposed to do that, he actually missed it and got a triple.

232
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So he did have to go longer.

233
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:51,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So can he actually do it faster?

234
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:51,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

235
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the, I guess now that's the thing.

236
00:19:54,428 --> 00:20:00,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but, or, or is it like, you know, I mean, I'm sure like with speed running, there's different categories.

237
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:01,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there like,

238
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:06,047
[SPEAKER_06]: how long you can stay, you know, playing that mode or something like that.

239
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:13,831
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, the goal is trying to avoid all those crash points type of thing, you know.

240
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:16,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my scene, but, like, that's cool, though.

241
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:17,173
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and it is cool.

242
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:30,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of scenes, you know, for all the negative gamer energy I've been talking about, which we've been seeing firsthand as a result of that reporting, let's talk about the positive gamer energy of the way the Tetris community has really uplifted that kid.

243
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,604
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and there were many people that were watching him do that accomplishment, giving him kudos for it.

244
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:47,131
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's the equivalent of shaking the hand and saying good game at the end of the match and really, you know, uplifting this person's accomplishment, which I think is great.

245
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,872
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 talks about this too.

246
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:58,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I had heard that now some of the good things that the media did in reporting this week, again, we talked about negative, but one of the good things here, so SheHulk copy pasted something.

247
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:15,369
[SPEAKER_07]: 13 year old meets Tetris creator after beating original game was almost too much for Willis, the kid that did this, who struggled to find the words when Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of the game we know today, and Hank Rogers, the company founder and chairman,

248
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,010
[SPEAKER_07]: surprised him in a Zoom interview with NBC News.

249
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:26,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So the NBC actually got the creator of Tetris, Alexei Pajitnov, to actually meet this kid.

250
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:28,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty rad.

251
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:31,255
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really cool thing that they did there.

252
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Meet your heroes kind of thing, right?

253
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:34,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Being able to meet the creator.

254
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:41,459
[SPEAKER_07]: And what an honor for Alexei, too, to be able to meet this kid 35 years after the fact.

255
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, keep in mind,

256
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:43,559
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't do the NES version.

257
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,560
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Seattle.

258
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like they brought him out of Russia.

259
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:50,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, you know, they, they, they made the connection happen.

260
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:51,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

261
00:21:51,203 --> 00:22:07,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, yeah, but like, and he didn't actually program the NES version of the game either, but still, you know, like what a cool thing for him to get to meet this kid that is, is finding new things in this scene that he did found all of those years ago.

262
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's certainly still more pop culture ref relevant nowadays, because we just had the Tetris movie.

263
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

264
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:22,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I mean, I don't know, I think it's cool.

265
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:36,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish that that mother would think about, you know, hey, would I rather like, encourage a child to do, you know, like, acknowledge their greatness and, you know, give them kudos, like, obviously, as

266
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:45,596
[SPEAKER_06]: a parent, you would know that just because they accomplished something now doesn't mean that that's going to be their just career, like that they're going to play Tetris or whatever.

267
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:47,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So what if it is, you know?

268
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:55,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, it's like, do you really think that like that's going to influence them so much that they're just going to drop everything?

269
00:22:55,023 --> 00:23:01,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no, it's just they will be in you support them in whatever they're interested in, whenever they're interested in it.

270
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

271
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,749
[SPEAKER_06]: why what purpose you would have like no you should really reconsider your career path it's not a career path it's just something that they did like

272
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:11,868
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's 13.

273
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

274
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:14,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's just dumb.

275
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and she was trying to make a joke.

276
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:18,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's it's it's not.

277
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:23,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's an old entire joke that's been like made for decades now.

278
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:23,816
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

279
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

280
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:34,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, if there's something about this whole thing, we can kind of, you know, ask the media or demand the media on the mass scale learn from this.

281
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:37,525
[SPEAKER_07]: That is that you know what video games are art.

282
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:41,068
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a legitimate entertainment medium.

283
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:45,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some, there's a lot of people that see it as an intellectual sport at this type.

284
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:50,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So we demand Sky News, NBC, ABC, CBS,

285
00:23:51,482 --> 00:24:06,492
[SPEAKER_07]: that you report on these with the same weight that you would report on similar types of medium and sports, sports basically, or, you know, movies or what have you, you should, and yet there's always going to be room for lighthearted commentary.

286
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:19,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's not every movie is serious either, but like, as far as accomplishments like this, you should be giving this the same way as if a 13 year old had broken the long jump world record or something like that.

287
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,242
[SPEAKER_07]: It, it deserves that same level of respect.

288
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:44,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like if you want to like say well, it's not a physical activity like chess or something like that You know if they he was a chess grandmaster or something like that You would be treating it with a lot more No, no, you know the sports people are still gonna go for that over something like chess and the whole thing is is it's a statement on just where priorities are here in this country people care and

289
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:49,884
[SPEAKER_02]: more about a game that you could, you know, break your head open over.

290
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:57,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching just all kinds of the various conditions that come as a result of playing football.

291
00:24:57,105 --> 00:25:08,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead, you know, it's also very ableist, too, if you think about it, because not everyone can get out and do a physical sport, but a person can get a controller in their hand and have a feet like this, you know.

292
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:18,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and to be fair, yes, I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying, but it's beyond this country too, because Sky News is based in a different country, but yes.

293
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:21,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but in a lot of the Western-based countries.

294
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

295
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:32,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's move on, on a positive note, and talk about some of the things that we have been playing this week, whether it was Tetris or something else, in a segment that we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

296
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will start with DarkSakura.

297
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:38,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess, really, it's How Was Your Gaming Weeks, because we weren't here last week.

298
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:40,987
[SPEAKER_07]: We did do a show on Christmas Eve, but we did it early.

299
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:45,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is our first time back in our normal slot in about three weeks.

300
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever length of time you want to talk about, DarkSakura, How Was Your Gaming Time?

301
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:54,691
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was actually, time was very eventful.

302
00:25:54,691 --> 00:26:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I played Dead by Daylight, I played Dreamlight Valley, I played Cult of the Lamb.

303
00:26:00,135 --> 00:26:06,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to stream Baldur's Gate 3, and it would crash only while I was streaming.

304
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:16,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that there's something about the cloud saves for Steam that can be a problem, so I might try it again.

305
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, every time it's failed, I've just played Colts of the Lamb, because I have Steam open already.

306
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:26,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played some Weird Al, you know, pinball.

307
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:31,297
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Transformers, which I haven't played because I really do not like the movies at all.

308
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,346
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I play?

309
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:38,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some other stuff.

310
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Saturn games, which I'll be getting a little bit into in a bit.

311
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:55,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you raided your friend, Rob, and I was there, I went in full-on tutorial mode on how to play the Cardian Legend.

312
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:57,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Chicken Stew was streaming that.

313
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:57,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

314
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:58,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

315
00:26:58,195 --> 00:26:59,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Good pal of mine on Twitch.

316
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:00,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was really fun.

317
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:03,464
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

318
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:07,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's just what it did.

319
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:22,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really enjoying Baldur's Gate 3, but I hate that I can't play it with my controller because it registers both my controller and keyboard as two separate players.

320
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:28,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't get it to unrecognize one versus the other, so I just had to play completely on keyboard.

321
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, we will move on to Loki.

322
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,839
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

323
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I just played Minecraft.

324
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:42,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's I know it's a shake up from normal, but it is just Minecraft.

325
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:48,434
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, I joined a new SMP called Fever Dream, which is a

326
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:58,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Collaborative event put on by MC Collab Station, which is kind of a Discord community of a bunch of different Minecraft content creators.

327
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:13,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And unlike some of the other events that we were supposed to be in, like MC Rewind, that didn't end up happening, they actually have the know-how and organization to be able to put together an event with 100 plus people.

328
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's quite a few people on the server.

329
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all at once, obviously.

330
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:24,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The server was really struggling that first day, but they did get it finally fleshed out and it's been working okay.

331
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:30,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The premise of this SMP is that it gets stranger as it goes on.

332
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is getting stranger.

333
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:36,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So every day there's updates or data packs that are being added in.

334
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,182
[SPEAKER_06]: that change things.

335
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:49,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So the overall terrain is just kind of modded anyways, but there's like, you know, weird graphics or there's strange things that happens.

336
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:57,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Like yesterday there was flower mimics where mobs would just spawn out of flowers and start attacking you.

337
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:10,217
[SPEAKER_06]: for no reason, or we'd have the dragon fight, which is a bunch of flowers and they kept spawning in killer bunnies from, you know, uh, uh, Monty Python, the Holy Grail.

338
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was fun.

339
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just like strange things like that.

340
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: So this SMP I'm planning on building in a, uh,

341
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:34,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaning heavily into the YouTube algorithm and putting together the cringiest builds possible for like YouTube thumbnails and that type of thing.

342
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:44,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So the area that I'm building is called the Cringelands, and some of the more popular memes nowadays are going to make an appearance there.

343
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:55,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got huge builds already planned, so it's... Right now it's been grinding this entire week, getting just the basic setup so that I can build giant things like that.

344
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I've been working on this entire week.

345
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:02,555
[SPEAKER_06]: also should be editing the other series and stuff as well.

346
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:07,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you tried at all the Fortnite Lego stuff?

347
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:09,097
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I haven't got a chance to try that yet.

348
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:09,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fun.

349
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing it a little bit.

350
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:15,179
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's I I'm not sure you could do like the builds like what you're doing.

351
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.

352
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's different.

353
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's very different.

354
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,540
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's it's fun.

355
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:19,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

356
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it would be I think the stuff that they have and there's more kind of like the fortnight building right where you build walls and stuff.

357
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:27,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

358
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:33,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of like how they had with I think Lego worlds is like that too.

359
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember too much because I only played that for a little bit.

360
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,226
[SPEAKER_07]: This plays way better than Lego worlds.

361
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:39,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just right.

362
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:39,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Better done.

363
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:43,672
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, we'll get your opinions on that someday when you've tried it.

364
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:44,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to check it out at some point.

365
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:45,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

366
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:46,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about my gaming week.

367
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:58,966
[SPEAKER_07]: So my gaming week, a lot of similar stuff that I've talked about on the show before, I mentioned earlier, like some things I was doing like dead by daylight, a lot of like the outdoor gaming stuff to Pikmin Bloom, I just hit level 83.

368
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:01,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It maxes out at 100.

369
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:02,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll get there this year.

370
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,849
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

371
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:09,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, Pokemon Go, I did the Rowlet community day that was yesterday for a little bit.

372
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:10,715
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of rainy, so I couldn't do it a lot.

373
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:14,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually been playing more Final Fantasy XIV.

374
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:15,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually was taking a break.

375
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:28,404
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember I was talking more about World of Warcraft Season of Discovery and Diablo 4, and I was kind of playing some of those games for a few months, but, you know, I kind of did everything I wanted to do in the current Diablo season, and same thing with Season of Discovery.

376
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still doing alts.

377
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:33,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Shane and I did a stream earlier this week where we were doing new characters,

378
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:38,572
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're gonna do new characters again later this week, by the way, so stay tuned for that.

379
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:42,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But outside of that, I've just been kind of getting back into Final Fantasy 14.

380
00:31:42,837 --> 00:31:49,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, having taken a couple months off the game, it's been really nice to kind of go back and, you know, it

381
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:56,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It just feels like, oh, yes, it's going back to an old favorite and, you know, like, oh, yeah, I miss doing this and playing stuff.

382
00:31:56,128 --> 00:32:01,231
[SPEAKER_07]: They also, by the way, did a bunch of Final Fantasy 14 announcements this weekend.

383
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:08,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday was the final fan fest leading up to the release of Dawn Trail, which is going to be out in the summer.

384
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:14,618
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't give a specific date yet because Yoshi P is paranoid about having to delay the game again, like what happened with Endwalker.

385
00:32:14,618 --> 00:32:18,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So he will not give a date until it's locked in, which, in my opinion, good for him.

386
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:38,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for him for sticking to that because I'm sure the folks that be that Square Enix really want him to lock in a date so they can start the marketing and the pre orders but he won't do it till he's got he knows it's done but they announced that the new class so there's going to be two new classes in Dawn Trail there's Viper which is kind of an original it's not really based on anything in prior

387
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But this other one is a deep cut.

388
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:42,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Pictomancer.

389
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:45,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a Pictomancer or Picto... Pictonight.

390
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:46,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

391
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:47,889
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Picto something.

392
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:48,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Realm.

393
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,452
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be using drawings.

394
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Realm from Final Fantasy VI.

395
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:53,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they will be using drawings.

396
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:54,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

397
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually...

398
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:58,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You should look up the video, DarkSakura, of the job in action.

399
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually paints like Moogles.

400
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:09,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't play, they said it doesn't play exactly like Realm because it doesn't just draw monsters, but the character will draw like scenery and that's what they use to attack.

401
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:10,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks really cool.

402
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:14,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks very like Splatoon-esque, but it's kind of neat.

403
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:15,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked it.

404
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:19,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to the expansion.

405
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:21,269
[SPEAKER_07]: My only like complaint

406
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:24,852
[SPEAKER_07]: is that this is very formulaic.

407
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:29,736
[SPEAKER_07]: The Final Fantasy XIV expansions, patch cycle, everything is so formulaic.

408
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:33,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, level cap goes up by 10.

409
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,001
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be six zones.

410
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,883
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be one eight-man raid, a one 24-man raid.

411
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:42,868
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be, you know, it's, I could probably even tell you what the item levels will be.

412
00:33:42,868 --> 00:33:44,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It's starting to get that predictable.

413
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I would love to see them shake up the formula just a little bit.

414
00:33:49,073 --> 00:34:08,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love for them to yank the mythic dungeon concept from World of Warcraft, which is basically instead of scaling you down to do old dungeons with friends, scale the old dungeons up to make them, you know, because there's so many awesome old dungeons that people haven't played in a long time because they're not relevant.

415
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:10,148
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would love to see that.

416
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:17,493
[SPEAKER_07]: But the most interesting feature they were talking about was the brand new casual mode, which was I think cosmic exploration is what they called it.

417
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:22,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And that looks really cool because it looked like the island sanctuary but on different planets.

418
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited to see that.

419
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:25,417
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be very interesting.

420
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:31,100
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, yes, so I've gone back to Final Fantasy XIV and I know we weren't talking about the updates anywhere else in the show.

421
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to mention that.

422
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:39,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So the other thing that I've been playing this week, I got a Christmas gift from Alan.

423
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:42,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I got, and it was on my list, I'd asked for it.

424
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:53,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a few things down so he had the choice because you might remember I said Loki I put the Oh my god, why is it the the machine with the crank that you got?

425
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:54,719
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

426
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you the playdate the playdate was on my list.

427
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:57,883
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got this

428
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:05,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reaching down to grab the smooshed box, but I can show you what it looks like.

429
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an Evercade.

430
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a retro game console.

431
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:09,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

432
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:14,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually uses cartridges and there's actually two consoles.

433
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually you can see it in the back.

434
00:35:15,953 --> 00:35:18,913
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually two cartridge slots in this thing.

435
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:25,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So you put two cartridges in there and then it kind of just shows you like a mishmash of those different cartridges and the games that are in it.

436
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:30,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So it comes with a Technos collection and a Data East collection.

437
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:34,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, I get to have burger time all over again.

438
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,260
[SPEAKER_07]: But they put some deep fucking cuts in these.

439
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:45,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I actually like about Evercade is that yeah, there's a couple big games, but they put some deep fucking cuts in these like and I was playing.

440
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:45,905
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

441
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Gate?

442
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:47,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Wizard Fire?

443
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing Wizard Fire, which I had never played before.

444
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,808
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like a like a 2D

445
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:53,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Nights of the Round Golden Axe

446
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan also said, well, I can't just buy you the system and only let you have the pack-in cartridges.

447
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:13,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So does he know me or what?

448
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:22,080
[SPEAKER_07]: He bought me the C64 Collection cartridge, which apparently is the first of three volumes of the C64 Collection.

449
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But this has, okay, so this has games you would know.

450
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:27,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer Games, Jumpman, Winter Games,

451
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:34,167
[SPEAKER_07]: AliCat, Impossible Mission, Gateway to Afashi, Idris Alpha, Storm Lord, Lee, Movie Monster Game, Marauder

452
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:52,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have some problems setting this system up to begin with, but I got through it.

453
00:36:52,152 --> 00:37:02,195
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened was it was having a hard time seeing my Wi-Fi, and I couldn't get it to connect to the internet to see it, and it would not see my router or anything.

454
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to do a hard system reset by using the flash button on the back of the console, basically putting the pin in there, and that fixed it.

455
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:14,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So just in case you get an Evercade, if it has problems out the box,

456
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,000
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

457
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,622
[SPEAKER_07]: S. Jonah Matt says, Yeah, those Evercades are looking more and more like a solid deal.

458
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:23,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the cool thing is they also make a handheld, but they handle looks cool.

459
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:26,265
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the cartridges will work in the handheld.

460
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:35,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's interesting about the handhelds, and because Alan was looking into this, he's like, they don't make a cartridge for the Capcom games.

461
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:40,511
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to get the Capcom games, you have to buy the handheld that has them baked in.

462
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,462
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

463
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:34,861
[SPEAKER_07]: a little puzzle sheet that lets you you actually put it so if you notice it actually says gribbly gobbly if you put in that code you unlock a bonus game and it does some it does some interesting things too apparently if you get volume two of c64 and you put volume one and two in at the same time you get a bonus game

464
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does interesting cute things like that.

465
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:44,767
[SPEAKER_07]: But also look at this, an actual fucking manual that actually, and I love how this is put together.

466
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:50,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually shows the game, tells you a little bit about it, shows like a screenshot of what it looks like.

467
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:59,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Even a game like Impossible Mission, it does its very best to explain what the fuck is going on with the puzzle pieces at the bottom and all that stuff.

468
00:38:59,115 --> 00:39:04,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Like honest to God, like even if like paying 30 bucks for a cartridge sounds like a lot,

469
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:11,320
[SPEAKER_07]: these manuals almost make it where it's like they're they're little books, DarkSakura, they're little books.

470
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.

471
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

472
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:13,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see it.

473
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:15,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, props to Evercade.

474
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:20,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you pissed me off for about five minutes until I figured out how to fix you, I'm enjoying you as a machine now.

475
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:22,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura, I fucking thought of you.

476
00:39:22,483 --> 00:39:25,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on the box?

477
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:26,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it talk about the expansions on the box?

478
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:29,254
[SPEAKER_02]: expansions.

479
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:31,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the cartridges, the other cartridges that you can buy.

480
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:36,116
[SPEAKER_07]: There's things like the Jellicoe collection, the Intellivision collection.

481
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:42,258
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an Indie Heroes collection, Loki, YYR games, if you're out there listening.

482
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:48,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just telling you right now that those Indie Heroes, many of them are Nest Maker games.

483
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:52,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, I'm like, hey, put my stuff on the cartridge.

484
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, Loki, Loki.

485
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:56,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Get on it.

486
00:39:56,665 --> 00:40:01,628
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to get pixel poops on one of these things or like a free game that's in there or something.

487
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:01,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

488
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, wait, I don't want to misstate anything.

489
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:07,471
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pretty sure cartridges list.

490
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to bring up the list of Oh, yes.

491
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:10,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here it is.

492
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:15,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So they actually have they thank you to the kind people at Wikipedia that do the work for me.

493
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't notice as I was with some of these they don't make anymore.

494
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:27,812
[SPEAKER_07]: like the Namco Museum collections you can't get actually, well you can get them but you get them from jacked up prices but I'm almost positive

495
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:33,460
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, Toaplan Arcade 1 and Toaplan Arcade 2.

496
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:40,804
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one where I was like, oh, oh, DarkSakura and I need to have a talk because like- All the Truxton we can stand.

497
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:42,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Truxton is in number one.

498
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:46,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Healy, Zero Wing, that's right, is in there.

499
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:48,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Twin Cobra in volume two.

500
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:54,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, when I saw that there were Toaplan cartridges, I was like, oh, DarkSakura and I have to have a talk.

501
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:56,247
[SPEAKER_02]: IndieHeroes

502
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:14,251
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe not all nest maker games because these aren't all nest games.

503
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:20,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Doodle World, Flea, Cubo 3, Pretty Sure Ployed.

504
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:29,145
[SPEAKER_07]: If the powers that be by some fucking miracle at Evercade are listening to this little show, which I doubt is the case, please contact us.

505
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:32,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, please.

506
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:37,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we're enjoyable and full of ideas.

507
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:44,747
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's well and we have a game we'd like you to put like I say we it's really Loki's game but we'll but DarkSakura and I are going to be the shills for it.

508
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:49,649
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a game we'd like you to put on your next collection.

509
00:41:49,649 --> 00:41:51,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even even as a freebie.

510
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll sell it cheap.

511
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:57,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very, very cheap.

512
00:41:57,132 --> 00:42:04,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I yeah, I thought sjo100mat says so the obvious question, when are you or are you able to stream playing this?

513
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:05,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Please look forward to it.

514
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:06,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am able.

515
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:08,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a simple HDMI cable.

516
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's the thing I got to warn y'all.

517
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:13,137
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one downside to this Evercade.

518
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:19,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was there on Amazon, I do want to warn you all, it does not come with an HDMI cable.

519
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But thankfully, like I have I have one that I pass around to stream.

520
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it goes to the PS5, then I move to the switch.

521
00:42:24,781 --> 00:42:26,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I move to the Evercade to stream it.

522
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It also does not come with an AC adapter.

523
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty typical nowadays.

524
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

525
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:38,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to get the USB plug and you put it in there.

526
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:39,930
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you have to.

527
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So just just read that part carefully.

528
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:47,116
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do look at investing in one of these, you need to have those cables or you're going to get me in for a nasty surprise.

529
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:50,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my one little thing.

530
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:50,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

531
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwell points out the the Atari 2600 plus is the same way.

532
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:54,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

533
00:42:55,765 --> 00:42:56,165
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

534
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:57,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

535
00:42:57,126 --> 00:43:00,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Silly, though, it's for the environment.

536
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:01,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

537
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:02,951
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really just to save a buck.

538
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:03,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

539
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:07,654
[SPEAKER_07]: When I buy all those AC adapters and keep losing them, then the I'm really saving the environment.

540
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:07,955
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

541
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:11,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that was I just want to talk about that.

542
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:14,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, yeah, I do want to buy some more of those cartridges for sure.

543
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of bummed they don't make the Namco ones anymore, because those are the ones I have my eye on.

544
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I might.

545
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:21,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I might pay the premium and get them anyway.

546
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather get them now before these things are like completely out of print and then it's a wild cost.

547
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:27,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

548
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:28,655
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

549
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:31,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, that's it for my Game of the Week.

550
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:33,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about what else is going on in the news.

551
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:34,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Programming update.

552
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:38,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned earlier, Bobby Blackwolf will not be here next week.

553
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:42,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We will, so please still be here next week at nine o'clock Eastern.

554
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:57,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if I bat my eyelashes kindly, Bobby Blackwolf will send us some footage, although I think he actually gets to Games Done Quick that day, so I can't guarantee we're gonna get something like that, because he may not have the time to put it together, but we'll be here next week.

555
00:43:57,754 --> 00:44:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next show that we will have off, and I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki remember this, we will not be here February 25th.

556
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be here pretty much every week.

557
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:14,040
[SPEAKER_07]: But February 25, I am on the Star Trek cruise again this year.

558
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be in the middle of the ocean.

559
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:22,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that the day we're actually let's see it leaves here one to know that is the day that I'm going to be in Curacao.

560
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:31,344
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will not be thinking of this program because I will be in the Caribbean sipping a very froofy homosexual drink out of a pineapple.

561
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:34,369
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever I could find or a coconut.

562
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:38,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that's my, that's my plan is the cruise.

563
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:41,941
[SPEAKER_07]: And what because Star Trek cruise while I'm doing this.

564
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:45,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know, drink in one hand, live long and prosper in the other.

565
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:45,668
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

566
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:50,199
[SPEAKER_02]: See how it is your real priorities are.

567
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:58,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, my real priority is meeting LeVar Burton and any of you hoes would do that exact same thing if you had the opportunity.

568
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:04,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, we are getting we are getting a meet and greet with LeVar Burton or a photo with LeVar Burton.

569
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:05,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very excited about that.

570
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:08,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if Todd's at this one this year.

571
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:09,438
[SPEAKER_07]: He is.

572
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:11,701
[SPEAKER_07]: They just announced him a few weeks ago.

573
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,723
[SPEAKER_07]: He is going back this year.

574
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:14,584
[SPEAKER_02]: He's such a cool guy.

575
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:15,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

576
00:45:15,265 --> 00:45:19,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Todd Stashwick, for those who don't know, he played... What was his character's name in Picard?

577
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:25,166
[SPEAKER_07]: The No Guy, Shaw, that was it.

578
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:25,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaw.

579
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:26,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've been saying.

580
00:45:26,947 --> 00:45:28,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaw.

581
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:31,108
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, he's the No Guy.

582
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:32,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

583
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, no, they have a lot of great guests this year.

584
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:39,691
[SPEAKER_07]: The Big Land is Sonequa Martin-Green is their captain this year.

585
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:43,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge, huge upgrade from Shatner.

586
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:46,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So Niko Martin-Green, of course, from Discovery.

587
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So, which unfortunately, they're not making any more Discovery.

588
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:53,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have her, they have Doug Jones, again, is going back.

589
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a lot of cool Discovery people.

590
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:59,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Doug Jones's Saru.

591
00:45:59,118 --> 00:46:00,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he's great.

592
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:03,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's, he's the nicest guy in person.

593
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:14,957
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just walking because the thing about the thing about celebrities on cruises, some of them will stay in their room and never leave and just hang with their families and that, you know, secure part of the ship Shatner.

594
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:19,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them go out and mingle with everybody else and have drinks.

595
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:21,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the wild thing.

596
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:23,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, imagine this couch behind me.

597
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:27,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those on the podcast feed, I have a couch behind me when we do the show live.

598
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:29,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine I'm sitting here having a drink.

599
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:34,323
[SPEAKER_07]: on this couch right there behind me also having a drink.

600
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:37,824
[SPEAKER_07]: John Delancey and Robert Picardo just sitting right behind me having a drink.

601
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:43,725
[SPEAKER_07]: John Delancey, of course, cue Robert Picardo, the holographic doctor emergency program from Voyager.

602
00:46:43,725 --> 00:46:46,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So like that's that's the runnage you have of people.

603
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:49,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And Doug Jones actually was just walking around giving out hugs.

604
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:55,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And when he gives hugs, he uses his big alien arms to like wrap around your entire head.

605
00:46:55,952 --> 00:47:00,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, he's very generous because like some of these people are a little strange.

606
00:47:00,756 --> 00:47:03,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's very, he's very full of love to be doing something like that.

607
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:07,042
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, but yeah, I'm a fan anyway.

608
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:07,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

609
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:08,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough about me.

610
00:47:08,643 --> 00:47:10,425
[SPEAKER_02]: He naturally just moves so gracefully.

611
00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:13,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he really does.

612
00:47:13,502 --> 00:47:14,223
[SPEAKER_07]: He really does.

613
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:14,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

614
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:16,426
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk about gaming news.

615
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:17,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into it.

616
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:19,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, I'm sick of this one already, Loki.

617
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,174
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have to talk about it because it's impacting all the industries.

618
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:23,915
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's get to it.

619
00:47:24,534 --> 00:47:43,103
[SPEAKER_06]: of course so yes because we're in the year of 2024 um due to copyright steamboat willy has made it into the public domain but that doesn't mean that like oh hey cool i'm gonna put mickey mouse in whatever i want now no no that is just steamboat willy and so what do we get out of that

620
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:48,528
[SPEAKER_06]: TheLowestBottomOfTheBarrelTrashHorrorGenreThings

621
00:48:04,636 --> 00:48:05,736
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks not good.

622
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:09,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the equivalent of that Winnie the Pooh thing from last year.

623
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:10,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, basically.

625
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:19,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's also a game now called Infestation Origins, previously called Infestation 88, but 88 kind of ties into Nazis.

626
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:24,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So they decided to change the name because that's probably not a good thing.

627
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it is also just a

628
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:39,581
[SPEAKER_06]: uh survival game with some you know steamboat willy looking thing chasing you down cool i mean i don't know it's more of like

629
00:48:40,829 --> 00:49:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: You knew this was gonna happen with some of the stuff and then people have been like reacting to like Steambo Willy and stuff But once again, it's Disney Disney's not gonna be like, oh you guys win you get Mickey Mouse now God, no, they own the trademark for that stuff They own that's why Mickey Mouse has been like redesigned so many other times like if they are not letting their cash cow mouse go because of

630
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:06,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Mere Copyright Law

631
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:32,822
[SPEAKER_07]: The copyright laws in some other countries, like I think Chile's one of them, are actually more stringent and more favor the copyright holders for longer.

632
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:36,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't think Disney's going to flex that muscle, ha!

633
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:41,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I was talking about this a little bit with Bobby on his show a little while ago.

634
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:48,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I think because I'm already sick of hearing about this like every and I feel like people are just doing this because they can which yes, it's part of that.

635
00:49:48,888 --> 00:49:59,011
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also feel like people because they know Disney's lawyers are infamously the most litigious bunch almost the entire country.

636
00:49:59,011 --> 00:50:09,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people love to be able to needle and poke and they want to push the envelope just as far as they can go with this whole thing without getting sued.

637
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,373
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as I'm concerned,

638
00:50:11,294 --> 00:50:31,609
[SPEAKER_07]: y'all other people that are jumping on this with your horror movies and your video games have fun pushing that envelope and seeing how far you can get because the minute you cross the line heaven help you with disney's legal squad oh yeah help you and i would suggest instead of purchasing infestation origins or whatever trash that is i'm

639
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:52,287
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other things they did bring up in the article here is talking about FumiGames' new FPS game, Mouse, which, unlike ripping off Steamboat Willie, basically does what Cuphead did with that genre of cartoon, adapted the style of it and made it its own thing.

640
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:58,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now they have an FPS game that's kind of done in that animation style, all black and white.

641
00:50:58,573 --> 00:50:59,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty awesome.

642
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mouse is the one to go check out.

643
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:06,159
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another one just like, it'll come out, it'll be trash.

644
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll be that.

645
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and everybody will forget about it.

646
00:51:09,241 --> 00:51:10,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they forgot about the Winnie the Pooh movie.

647
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:15,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the fact that we're all sick of these derivative reboots in Hollywood.

648
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:17,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget that also applies to Steamboat Willie.

649
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:24,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because it's in the public domain, doesn't change the fact that we're sick of seeing the same thing over and over in media.

650
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:25,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, right?

651
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:28,169
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we all feel about the Mean Girls movie that's coming out?

652
00:51:28,993 --> 00:51:30,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think there's a lot of people.

653
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:30,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

654
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:31,657
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they doing?

655
00:51:31,657 --> 00:51:32,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're redoing it.

656
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:34,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

657
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

658
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:39,868
[SPEAKER_07]: They're completely and utterly hiding the fact, and I don't know why.

659
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:42,652
[SPEAKER_07]: They are completely and utterly hiding the fact it's a musical.

660
00:51:43,607 --> 00:51:48,109
[SPEAKER_07]: and all of the marketing, all of the trailers, they're hiding the fact it's a musical.

661
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:54,211
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why Mean Girls is being done again, it's literally the exact same thing that happened to Hairspray.

662
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:59,913
[SPEAKER_07]: John Waters made Hairspray in 88, it became a Broadway musical, now they're making a movie out of the musical.

663
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:03,294
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Mean Girls musical on Broadway and off.

664
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:05,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there was a musical on Broadway.

665
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,956
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the movie adaptation of that.

666
00:52:07,956 --> 00:52:12,558
[SPEAKER_07]: None of the marketing makes that apparent whatsoever, unless you're looking for it.

667
00:52:12,558 --> 00:52:17,620
[SPEAKER_07]: You will notice in some quick shots, you can be like, they're doing like a coordinated dance or they're doing that.

668
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a fucking musical.

669
00:52:19,588 --> 00:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's so many people that are like, we don't need another Mean Girls.

670
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,471
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the original Mean Girls.

671
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:25,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a good movie.

672
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:26,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need another one.

673
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:29,154
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's the same thing with Steamboat Willie.

674
00:52:29,154 --> 00:52:48,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, a Steamboat Willie musical, on the other hand, oh, and Deidre Maes, of course, the most obvious answer, literally sitting in front of my face, The Color Purple, literally the exact same thing happening right now, again, was a movie in the 80s, goes to Broadway, and now is a movie with the same Broadway star, Fantasia from American Idol.

675
00:52:48,107 --> 00:52:49,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, yes, literally that.

676
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:57,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I mean, that movie is a lot older than Mean Girls.

677
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,214
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

678
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:04,739
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie has about 20 years on Mean Girls, but still, it's got a lot of music in the movie already.

679
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:05,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

680
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:12,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not going to tell you how many times I saw the color purple growing up because my mother would watch it every freaking time it came on HBO.

681
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:12,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

682
00:53:12,604 --> 00:53:14,045
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom loved that movie, too.

683
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:16,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up watching it a lot as a result, too.

684
00:53:16,046 --> 00:53:18,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

685
00:53:20,307 --> 00:53:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, in my universe, Wicked is only ever a book.

686
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:29,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but the thing about Wicked is that it was never, well, I guess some would say it was the Wizard of Oz.

687
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:32,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a different story.

688
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:37,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, derivative writing is normal.

689
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

690
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that happens.

691
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:43,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Oz books went in the public domain some time ago.

692
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, they've been in the public domain for ages.

693
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:51,301
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a crappy Disney movie a few years ago as a result of that.

694
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:53,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, actually, was it?

695
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:54,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

696
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:55,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Return to Oz.

697
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,186
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, I think, the first.

698
00:53:57,186 --> 00:53:57,727
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

699
00:53:57,727 --> 00:53:58,948
[SPEAKER_07]: That was dark, but it was good.

700
00:53:58,948 --> 00:53:59,808
[SPEAKER_07]: It fucked us up.

701
00:53:59,808 --> 00:54:02,511
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was one in about 2006 with, like, Leo.

702
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:04,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Oz the Great and Powerful.

703
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:04,612
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

704
00:54:04,612 --> 00:54:05,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Oz the Great and Powerful.

705
00:54:05,653 --> 00:54:06,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one.

706
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,239
[SPEAKER_06]: They, that didn't work.

707
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:16,189
[SPEAKER_06]: They were hoping to reboot the franchise and do like a multi-movie franchise with that, but it just didn't work out because... I don't know.

708
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:17,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody was asking for it.

709
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because people still watch The Original Wizard of Oz.

710
00:54:22,216 --> 00:54:24,537
[SPEAKER_02]: People like these freaking musicals.

711
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:25,377
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thing now.

712
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:25,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

713
00:54:25,857 --> 00:54:27,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

714
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:31,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as there's a market for it, they're gonna put it out.

715
00:54:31,058 --> 00:54:33,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the choice not to watch it.

716
00:54:33,459 --> 00:54:35,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's as simple as that.

717
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:40,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, right now, for some of that, I'm just sort of in the camp of don't piss in other people's cornflakes.

718
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:41,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

719
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:49,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they're not hurting anybody, and they're not shoving it down my throat, and they're enjoying it, let them enjoy it.

720
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:54,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually kind of- As long as it's not profiting like Nazis or something.

721
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:59,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually kind of wish they would adapt the Jagged Little Pill musical into a movie.

722
00:54:59,134 --> 00:55:08,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it- I don't know how they do it without cutting some serious corners because it is about three hours worth of musical, but I hope they make it a movie.

723
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:09,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

724
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,559
[SPEAKER_02]: How long was Avatar The Way of Water?

725
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:12,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

726
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can make a three hour musical.

727
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:14,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look at the sound of music.

728
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:15,704
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing wrong with that.

729
00:55:15,704 --> 00:55:17,987
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, usually they don't.

730
00:55:17,987 --> 00:55:22,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at Dune, the original version of Dune.

731
00:55:22,972 --> 00:55:27,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I don't want is a part one and a part two, which, by the way, is what they're doing with Wicked.

732
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:32,891
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll see, I will see that Wicked movies.

733
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:36,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I will see those Wicked movies because number one, Ariana Grande.

734
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:37,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, Michelle Yeoh.

735
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:44,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Like number three, that fucking finest fuck guy that voices Graha Tia, what's it, Jonathan Bailey.

736
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:46,561
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all in that movie.

737
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:50,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be seated for the Wicked movie and I don't want to hear it.

738
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hear it.

739
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:54,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe I have to see it because Ariana Grande's in it.

740
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:54,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

741
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:59,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, you know, I want to know what what her hair is made out of.

742
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:01,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that people may be upset.

743
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:04,667
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Ariana Grande, not Kristen Chenoweth, but.

744
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:09,170
[SPEAKER_07]: It it has been 20 years, so they had to recast some things.

745
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, Kristen still has a cameo in it somewhere.

746
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:17,377
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I'm fan of three little words, Rob.

747
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:18,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Deal with it.

748
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:20,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

749
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:21,099
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

750
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:24,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Sony's gonna have to deal with this.

751
00:56:24,621 --> 00:56:40,912
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some information that was inadvertently leaked, cluing us all in that there is a Horizon, as in Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West, there is a Horizon MMORPG that is confirmed to be in development basically because a job listing got posted.

752
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:52,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So a video game researcher posted on Twitter earlier this week to detail the things that they knew about the game.

753
00:56:52,317 --> 00:57:04,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It is an MMORPG to be precise, which also is in line with the fact that we know that Sony is trying to create a series, like what was it, six games, you know, for the PS5 that are going to be, you know, games as a service type of thing.

754
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:08,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would fall in line with that whole thing too.

755
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,485
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is now essentially confirmed to be in development.

756
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:23,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It's developed under the codename Project Skyline, with the initial codename being Project H. And NCSoft registered a domain for what appears to be a game titled Land of Salvation.

757
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Land of Salvation could maybe be the title for the Horizon MMO.

758
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:32,072
[SPEAKER_07]: This assumption is based on the fact it's the only unannounced game we know of that could be revealed soon.

759
00:57:32,072 --> 00:57:35,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it could be some other project that we're not aware of.

760
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:39,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was a job listing for something called Project Skyline,

761
00:57:39,474 --> 00:57:40,115
[SPEAKER_07]: PS5 NCSoft

762
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:01,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Horizon MMO

763
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:34,239
[SPEAKER_07]: So, until we wait for games like Horizon the MMO, we will have to stick to the classics, right DarkSakura?

764
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:38,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, and I have a good classic to talk about.

765
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:44,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for me to think of this as a classic, but I do have so many good memories about it.

766
00:58:44,265 --> 00:58:52,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a game that was put in my hands and I was told to beat if I expected to stay in this apartment.

767
00:58:52,651 --> 00:59:01,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, I am talking about the game known as, we saw it as Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

768
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Japanese version was a direct sequel to Dracula X on PC Engine, and it was called Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight.

769
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It had problems.

770
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:20,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll take that back.

771
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,730
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation version was great.

772
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about as perfect of a game as you could get.

773
00:59:25,171 --> 00:59:39,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But we knew that there were things cut from it, you know, like there's that whole scene where you can get the trap door in the courtyard to open with a little bit of trickery, and then it just goes down to a safe space, but it looked like there was something else meant to be there.

774
00:59:39,716 --> 00:59:45,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, when the Saturn version came out, it did restore those areas that

775
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:53,264
[SPEAKER_02]: that were missing from the game, like the underground garden.

776
00:59:53,264 --> 01:00:02,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were also the ability to play as Maria and Richter Belmont.

777
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,836
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave him his outfit from the cutscenes, but

778
01:00:08,348 --> 01:00:10,449
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people weren't satisfied with it.

779
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:13,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we played the shit out of it.

780
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did do a side-by-side comparison with both Japanese versions and found that there were transparencies missing.

781
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:30,803
[SPEAKER_02]: The Saturn that is a much better 2D machine wasn't doing the 2D to its best capability.

782
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:31,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course,

783
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:36,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only understand about 25% of what people were saying.

784
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:47,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there is a full translated version of Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight into English using the PSP version as its template.

785
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:55,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And it reduces the load times, has bug fixes, and lets you use the Saturn's 4MB RAM cartridge.

786
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It restored as many of the transparency effects as were possible.

787
01:01:04,337 --> 01:01:09,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Resized some of the sprites to match the PlayStation version.

788
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:14,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You have direct access to the Global Map, the finalized Global Map.

789
01:01:15,191 --> 01:01:30,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It removes some horizontal lines, you can skip videos and dialogues, of course you have Richter's alternate costume, they fix some bugs, and there's a hard mode.

790
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:40,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I was rather, uh, interested when I, cause I, I've gotten it to work on my, uh, I'll say, I'll say it right now.

791
01:01:40,357 --> 01:01:53,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on an emulator, but I'm allowed to play it on the emulator because I own both, uh, I own both the English and Japanese PlayStation versions and I own the, the Japanese, of course, Saturn version.

792
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:57,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started playing it in about,

793
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:04,858
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 minutes ago, because I finally was able to get it to work.

794
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:07,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I started right off with Maria.

795
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,303
[SPEAKER_02]: The menus were in English and I'm like, heck yeah.

796
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:17,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, you know, has the specific tracks for whoever you decide is your your intro character.

797
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:22,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely suggest remapping the buttons.

798
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,254
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it it plays great.

799
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:24,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.

800
01:02:24,894 --> 01:02:26,015
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds great.

801
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:26,235
[SPEAKER_02]: The

802
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:34,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I didn't know better, I would have said I was playing the PlayStation version.

803
01:02:34,913 --> 01:02:44,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really did load very quickly, but I have to say I had a ping of nostalgia the moment I saw the Konami logo walking out.

804
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:46,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

805
01:02:48,274 --> 01:02:50,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, I haven't played Symphony of the Night in years.

806
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:51,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I really need to.

807
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:58,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I got a random PlayStation collection that had that and I want to say it was Dracula.

808
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was that.

809
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:03,163
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like a combo collection that I got on PlayStation.

810
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I never did beat Symphony of the Night.

811
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:05,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go back and do that.

812
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:08,626
[SPEAKER_02]: On PlayStation, they did the PSP one.

813
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:11,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they've released it since then, I think on other things.

814
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:16,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that PSP version is now on PlayStation 4 or whatever.

815
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

816
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:29,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you can play the remastered Dracula X and the original Dracula X, which is really great.

817
01:03:29,884 --> 01:03:31,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Dracula X was a great game.

818
01:03:31,745 --> 01:03:39,127
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, it's one of the last really traditional Castlevania games.

819
01:03:39,127 --> 01:03:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

820
01:03:43,328 --> 01:03:47,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember being so excited about the Saturn version and being able to play as Maria.

821
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: All of her magic is actually related back to her animal friend attacks.

822
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:10,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, she has the turtle for Genbu, the turtle god.

823
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:15,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hey, and you really know these if you watch Fushigi Yuugi, just saying!

824
01:04:15,777 --> 01:04:23,083
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Byakko for the tiger attack, you have Seiryu for a dragon attack, and...

825
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,707
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's so funny?

826
01:04:26,707 --> 01:04:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all- Suzaku for the Phoenix attack, sorry.

827
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:35,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Suzaku, Seiryo, Byakko, those are all fights in Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood expansion content.

828
01:04:35,235 --> 01:04:36,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all like new primals.

829
01:04:36,936 --> 01:04:37,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's funny.

830
01:04:37,717 --> 01:04:41,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also, you know, mythical beings.

831
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:43,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

832
01:04:43,082 --> 01:04:46,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess more of my point was they get reused in video game media.

833
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:46,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

834
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:50,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, anime, video games, you name it.

835
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:52,512
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a major part of a part of things.

836
01:04:52,512 --> 01:04:57,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll even see, you know, sometimes it sneaks over into American stuff, too.

837
01:04:57,995 --> 01:05:09,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, this is and I will go ahead and say this, if anyone is looking for this, it's available through Internet Archive right now.

838
01:05:09,381 --> 01:05:12,022
[SPEAKER_02]: But talk to me.

839
01:05:12,022 --> 01:05:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

840
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:13,443
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.

841
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:15,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying anything about what I'm going to do.

842
01:05:15,863 --> 01:05:19,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just, you know, draw on it with you, but talk to me.

843
01:05:19,285 --> 01:05:20,926
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

844
01:05:20,926 --> 01:05:23,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, Loki.

845
01:05:23,148 --> 01:05:24,128
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

846
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:31,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sony has been fined by the France regulatory government body that basically regulates competition there.

847
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:34,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to try to pronounce that French name.

848
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:36,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Not one bit.

849
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:38,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have been fined 13.5 million euros.

850
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:48,503
[SPEAKER_06]: for deploying technical countermeasures which affect proper functionality of third-party video game controllers.

851
01:05:48,503 --> 01:05:53,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, what they did is they basically blocked third-party controllers from working on the PlayStation 5.

852
01:05:53,126 --> 01:05:59,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I guess this is PlayStation 4 compatible controllers they're talking about now.

853
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:03,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that sounds like, you know,

854
01:06:04,622 --> 01:06:10,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know Microsoft, we just talked about them a few weeks ago doing something similar.

855
01:06:10,688 --> 01:06:15,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see if this type of ruling comes down to them as well.

856
01:06:15,032 --> 01:06:28,425
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, you know, along with deploying the technical countermeasures, they said that those measures were disproportionate in the fact that they were affecting all unlicensed controllers indiscriminately.

857
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:29,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sony wasn't like saying,

858
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:34,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we approve this one, we don't approve this one, you know, that type of thing.

859
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:50,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is to say that because also they were their opaque licensing policy in which several cases prevented rival companies that wanted to market PlayStation 4 compatible controllers from joining its OLP partnership program.

860
01:06:53,632 --> 01:07:01,417
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like they tried to go the official route, they went the unofficial route, and they still got banned for it.

861
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:06,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're like, well, how am I supposed to create peripherals then for the PlayStation 4?

862
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:10,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess you can't, because Sony wants to sell those first-party controllers.

863
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:12,884
[SPEAKER_06]: At least they're going to do so with now a fine.

864
01:07:18,757 --> 01:07:25,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what kind of trickle down effect this might have on what's going on at Microsoft because didn't we just have that story?

865
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:25,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we did.

866
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:36,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Two months ago when they were locking out third party controllers and we even had a call about that because remember our listener that had that really awesome custom controller they were taking all around EVO and all that stuff that.

867
01:07:36,145 --> 01:07:36,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

868
01:07:36,646 --> 01:07:36,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

869
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:48,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It would depend on how they like, I think if it they would look at the two different factors of this one, how does their prevention of unlicensed products?

870
01:07:48,954 --> 01:07:51,035
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that affecting like everything?

871
01:07:51,035 --> 01:07:54,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it affecting some of the unlicensed things?

872
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:57,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it all of the unlicensed things?

873
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, on top of that,

874
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:06,259
[SPEAKER_06]: How hard is it to get into their partnership program to develop third-party controllers?

875
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:22,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I think the scope, I don't really know what defense Sony did as far as saying something along the lines of what Microsoft was saying where they're using this to combat people using keyboard and mouse on a console.

876
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:30,865
[SPEAKER_06]: versus, you know, a controller because it gives them an unfair advantage, I guess, in multiplayer games.

877
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:52,139
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's that or if this sounds like on the Sony side that it was to prevent competition, which I think that they, you know, like a government body, like say in the United States or something, would be more consider considering competition versus, oh, it's unfair for some people, you know, in that space.

878
01:08:52,139 --> 01:08:53,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'd have to see

879
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:02,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can see since they won this that, yeah, maybe they will try to do something like this when Microsoft pushes this forward.

880
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:06,066
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends on how draconian their implementation of it is.

881
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:08,748
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's just, nothing works, then...

882
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:20,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but I think that there are still some approved third-party peripherals out there for the Xbox series.

883
01:09:20,893 --> 01:09:22,313
[SPEAKER_06]: There are.

884
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:24,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So that may be a harder argument to make.

885
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:25,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

886
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:26,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

887
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:26,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

888
01:09:28,304 --> 01:09:40,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, over at Nintendo, there was an interesting interview with The Guardian, who did an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, of course, the man behind Mario and many of the Nintendo characters that you love.

889
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:47,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, one may notice that Miyamoto is getting older, and people are wondering if he is going to retire.

890
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:51,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So The Guardian just basically straight up asked him, do you have any plans at all to retire?

891
01:09:51,433 --> 01:09:54,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And Miyamoto said he has no plans to retire.

892
01:09:55,014 --> 01:09:58,657
[SPEAKER_07]: But he does say that he thinks about things in a five-year time span.

893
01:09:58,657 --> 01:09:59,877
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an interesting kind of answer.

894
01:09:59,877 --> 01:10:07,363
[SPEAKER_07]: He thinks about things in five-year blocks, and sometimes he thinks about who he can pass things on to in case something happens.

895
01:10:07,363 --> 01:10:15,729
[SPEAKER_07]: So he says he has no plans to retire, but he says, more so than retiring, I'm thinking about the day I fall over, which he says with a smile.

896
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:18,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's kind of cracking a morbid joke about

897
01:10:19,051 --> 01:10:26,475
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll probably die still working for Nintendo and saying, in this day and age, you have to think about things in a five year time span.

898
01:10:26,475 --> 01:10:30,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think about who I can pass things on to in case something does happen.

899
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:34,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really thankful that there is so much energy around things that I have worked on.

900
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,282
[SPEAKER_07]: These are things that have already gone out into the world.

901
01:10:37,282 --> 01:10:38,943
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been cultivated by others.

902
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people have been raising them, helping them grow.

903
01:10:41,164 --> 01:10:44,026
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that sense, I don't feel too much ownership over them anymore.

904
01:10:44,386 --> 01:11:01,715
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, other people have kind of noticed that with Miyamoto, you know, it seems like he's probably spending less time actually in the active development of games and a little more time kind of pushing and being a face and a brand for Nintendo and expanding Nintendo back into those other things.

905
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:06,278
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, the movie and the success of this Mario Brothers movie from the last year.

906
01:11:06,278 --> 01:11:09,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Miyamoto did a lot with that partnership and making that Mario movie happen.

907
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios.

908
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:16,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, who was there from Nintendo the day that parked open?

909
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:17,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Miyamoto.

910
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:23,969
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's been very much a face, I think, in expanding Mario and Nintendo and stuff into these other areas.

911
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:32,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying he's not involved with the video games at all, but I think when you look at him say a comment about, you put these things out in the world, they're being cultivated by others.

912
01:11:32,114 --> 01:11:37,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you sort of hear that, like, he hasn't trusted a lot of this game development to

913
01:11:37,998 --> 01:11:43,853
[SPEAKER_07]: his successors internally at Nintendo, and he's serving his characters and his creations in these other ways right now.

914
01:11:43,853 --> 01:11:45,817
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of one thing I sort of see there.

915
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tigerclaw says, Do you think Miyamoto will still be developing games while in his 80s or 90s?

916
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:55,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to say, and that's really his choice, not mine.

917
01:11:55,961 --> 01:11:59,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would think he'll still have something to say.

918
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:06,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, even if he were to, say, retire from Nintendo, people are still going to want to put games in front of him to get his opinion.

919
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:08,170
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about this?

920
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:08,871
[SPEAKER_07]: What does your brain say?

921
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:12,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he does that a lot with Nintendo properties as it is.

922
01:12:13,194 --> 01:12:17,397
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, he looks at games and maybe things go a certain way or they don't.

923
01:12:17,397 --> 01:12:26,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Like didn't didn't the Star Fox game on GameCube question mark start off as something else?

924
01:12:26,204 --> 01:12:26,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, wasn't it?

925
01:12:26,965 --> 01:12:28,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Miyamoto that shifted it that way?

926
01:12:28,686 --> 01:12:29,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

927
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:34,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But sometimes there are games that start as one thing and you know, it might be that his input it kind of shifts somewhere else.

928
01:12:37,495 --> 01:12:39,416
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, it's on his schedule.

929
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:40,836
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for him to determine.

930
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm glad to see he still plans to keep working and so forth.

931
01:12:45,018 --> 01:12:45,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

932
01:12:45,338 --> 01:12:51,860
[SPEAKER_07]: SJ100 Matt says, I hope he develops games as long as he wants and not told to keep making games by someone.

933
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,680
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would hope not.

934
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he I think he's free to leave on his own.

935
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,242
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Miyamoto, it's not Sakurai.

936
01:13:00,235 --> 01:13:02,556
[SPEAKER_06]: get in there make us another Smash Brothers.

937
01:13:02,556 --> 01:13:06,217
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt points out Miyazaki never seems to retire either.

938
01:13:06,217 --> 01:13:08,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So uh, yeah.

939
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifth Dream says he even had input on Pokemon.

940
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:11,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

941
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:15,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know, people value the man's opinion greatly.

942
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that's ever going away.

943
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:22,983
[SPEAKER_07]: What could be interesting though, just, I'm just gonna play silly for a minute.

944
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:25,344
[SPEAKER_07]: If he were to retire and leave Nintendo,

945
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:31,832
[SPEAKER_07]: He could give this input to games that weren't necessarily just Nintendo games.

946
01:13:31,832 --> 01:13:36,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, but you know he's going to be Nintendo from, you know, life to death.

947
01:13:36,816 --> 01:13:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: His heart will still be with Nintendo until the very end.

948
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:39,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

949
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:40,379
[SPEAKER_07]: The heart will go on.

950
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:41,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

951
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,100
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

952
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,703
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to take it out of him and just leave it in the office for all to see.

953
01:13:45,703 --> 01:13:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: See, here's what's going to happen is they're going to save Miyamoto's brain, Iwata's heart,

954
01:13:52,717 --> 01:14:01,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're, they probably have pieces preserved off of, um, uh, you've been playing too much Castlevania.

955
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the plot of Simon's quest you're getting into.

956
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:08,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was thinking more Frankenstein's monster, but yeah.

957
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:09,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

958
01:14:09,364 --> 01:14:12,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will have ultimate Nintendo, man.

959
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with Matt.

960
01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:14,026
[SPEAKER_07]: This turned very dark.

961
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It is me.

962
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they already have done this.

963
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,141
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think Reggie Fils-Aimé is?

964
01:14:21,141 --> 01:14:24,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if that's not Frankenstein's monster, I don't know.

965
01:14:24,823 --> 01:14:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Reggie's going to have that linebacker body.

966
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,424
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the that's the body right there.

967
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that was their first attempt.

968
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:32,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Went pretty well, I think.

969
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ready for version two already.

970
01:14:35,406 --> 01:14:36,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boy.

971
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:43,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they'll take Miyamoto and Sakurai and split the brains together and they'll have the adjoined brain and the adjoined heart.

972
01:14:43,668 --> 01:14:45,349
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have two hearts like like the doctor.

973
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The more organs, the more human.

974
01:15:05,174 --> 01:15:07,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I agree with this.

975
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:07,835
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

976
01:15:07,835 --> 01:15:12,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I am changing the topic, but I'm changing the topic by saying, please go to our next topic, DarkSakura.

977
01:15:12,496 --> 01:15:13,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

978
01:15:13,456 --> 01:15:15,156
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt has the best line.

979
01:15:15,156 --> 01:15:21,018
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to freeze all of them to battle with the future return of Segata Sanshiro.

980
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:22,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Segata Sanshiro.

981
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:25,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it here.

982
01:15:25,058 --> 01:15:25,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you love it.

983
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:27,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

984
01:15:27,499 --> 01:15:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we're all about accessibility here.

985
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:32,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we are.

986
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:33,805
[SPEAKER_02]: We better be.

987
01:15:33,805 --> 01:15:35,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We all need to take people.

988
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:35,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

989
01:15:42,339 --> 01:15:55,924
[SPEAKER_02]: are a lot of strides being taken toward better accessibility in games and Harada Katsuhiro has listed some details about Tekken 8's accessibility mode.

990
01:15:55,924 --> 01:16:02,986
[SPEAKER_02]: He has tweeted saying, I have developed and tested an accessibility version of Tekken 7, albeit not for sale, several years ago.

991
01:16:02,986 --> 01:16:06,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The studies have been introduced into this version of Tekken 8.

992
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:13,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And it basically has different colorblind accessibility modes.

993
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:18,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can play your characters in black and white.

994
01:16:19,736 --> 01:16:38,843
[SPEAKER_02]: with them being horizontal black and white bars and the other being vertical black and white bars, sort of 2D over 3D, blue and yellow characters over an inverted black and white background, even with different color filters over it to retain the 3D.

995
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:48,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be perfectly honest, a lot of looking at this is very overstimulating for me personally, because there's so much going on, like,

996
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:49,870
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

997
01:16:50,856 --> 01:17:01,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the one that's really bugging me the most is, you know, have you ever taken just like a, like a full on normal 3d picture and then try to put it into a vector program?

998
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:04,627
[SPEAKER_02]: How it just reduces everything like to line vector.

999
01:17:04,627 --> 01:17:06,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just does not do a great job.

1000
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just these random.

1001
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:11,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Quigley blurs and shapes, you know, that vaguely look like stuff.

1002
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,753
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what one of them looks like to me.

1003
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:17,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, um, I cannot, please, please, brain does not compute.

1004
01:17:17,357 --> 01:17:19,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But for, but I would imagine for people.

1005
01:17:21,298 --> 01:17:26,021
[SPEAKER_02]: that need this kind of visual interface.

1006
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1007
01:17:28,302 --> 01:17:32,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That for them, you know, this is this is definitely a big step.

1008
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are already saying that.

1009
01:17:35,445 --> 01:17:45,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be perfectly honest, of course, the majority of of people who deal with colorblindness are going to be predominantly

1010
01:17:49,304 --> 01:17:56,126
[SPEAKER_02]: assigned male at birth, I'll say, born with that genetic predisposition toward it.

1011
01:17:56,126 --> 01:18:03,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But even so, I can see how some of this would be good also for people with other conditions, too.

1012
01:18:03,828 --> 01:18:16,951
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, people with poor eyesight might be able to play with that yellow and blue mode and have a better opportunity to see the characters or people with

1013
01:18:18,211 --> 01:18:20,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus Issues, and Laura Bliss!

1014
01:18:20,733 --> 01:18:22,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome in!

1015
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:25,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1016
01:18:25,656 --> 01:18:28,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to say so as one of my streamer friends.

1017
01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:30,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome in.

1018
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,901
[SPEAKER_02]: But to go back to what I was talking about,

1019
01:18:33,278 --> 01:18:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, uh, the demo showing this off is, it's already there, um, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and PC.

1020
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:49,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bandai Namco is releasing the full game on January 26, 2024.

1021
01:18:49,781 --> 01:18:55,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't doubt that there'll be, uh, other aspects to this built into it.

1022
01:18:55,562 --> 01:18:57,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really good.

1023
01:18:57,402 --> 01:18:57,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1024
01:18:57,642 --> 01:19:00,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream says, I have issues with following too much movement.

1025
01:19:00,823 --> 01:19:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: This could help maybe.

1026
01:19:03,942 --> 01:19:14,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very interesting to see all the way these games are innovating in accessibility, you know, it was commented in chat, Dr. Tsuya said Mortal Kombat 1 and Street Fighter 6 did some cool stuff with accessibility as well.

1027
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:23,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember like the descriptive fatalities in Mortal Kombat 1, you know, there's there's been a lot of creativity in the accessibility realm with fighting games.

1028
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool to see.

1029
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:27,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nice that Tekken is kind of continuing that trend.

1030
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:27,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

1031
01:19:31,523 --> 01:19:45,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see games offer more ways to play with switch control, for example, or with eye tracking.

1032
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:48,250
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can get the eye tracking down a lot better,

1033
01:19:49,486 --> 01:19:53,068
[SPEAKER_02]: then I see a lot of potential in that.

1034
01:19:53,068 --> 01:20:04,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used a couple of different eye-tracking devices to control things, I'd say over the last year or so, and it's getting better.

1035
01:20:04,074 --> 01:20:09,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I really see games opening up to more people.

1036
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,978
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation VR, too, does that.

1037
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:13,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very fascinating, yeah.

1038
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:13,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1039
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:23,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on, on a completely different note, I don't know how to transition to this topic, Loki, but it's something people are talking about!

1040
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:30,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's the final, final recent act in the three-part act.

1041
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:32,045
[SPEAKER_07]: The third revision to Twitch's DanceOn.

1042
01:20:32,045 --> 01:20:37,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the three-part act that is the Twitch allowing artistic nudity.

1043
01:20:37,528 --> 01:20:39,710
[SPEAKER_07]: The climax, if you will.

1044
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so now, now they don't.

1045
01:20:42,932 --> 01:20:43,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least, they don't.

1046
01:20:45,314 --> 01:21:02,249
[SPEAKER_06]: People once again keep trying to skirt by the rules in different ways, so one of the new metas was this implied nudity meta, so basically they were putting black bars across different areas of their body even though they were clothed underneath.

1047
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:03,470
[SPEAKER_06]: No Austin Powers.

1048
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:32,213
[SPEAKER_06]: No Austin Powers.

1049
01:21:32,213 --> 01:21:32,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1050
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Austin Powers banned and banned from Twitch.

1051
01:21:36,155 --> 01:21:38,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you all know what I'm referencing in that movie.

1052
01:21:38,216 --> 01:21:45,619
[SPEAKER_07]: The infamous scene where the continuous objects are covering up the body parts that are otherwise implied nude.

1053
01:21:45,619 --> 01:21:48,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But I believe they wanted to keep that movie at a PG-13 rate.

1054
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it is rated R. I don't know.

1055
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:51,683
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

1056
01:21:51,683 --> 01:21:55,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they did the same fucking joke in the sequel, if I remember right.

1057
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:56,845
[SPEAKER_06]: In all of the movies.

1058
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:57,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course they did.

1059
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course they did.

1060
01:21:59,006 --> 01:22:00,047
[SPEAKER_07]: No Austin Powersing.

1061
01:22:00,965 --> 01:22:05,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so does that make the trailer for the latest Yakuza game legal then?

1062
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:07,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it kind of did the same thing.

1063
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:09,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I think games are different.

1064
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:15,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it necessarily applies to games.

1065
01:22:15,141 --> 01:22:17,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was one of the things that they did call out on it.

1066
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:29,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see... Right, because you don't get banned for playing Baldur's Gate 3 if you just brush by that part of the... and I mean that part of the character creator.

1067
01:22:29,393 --> 01:22:32,855
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm sure if you were, you know, spending hours and hours, you know,

1068
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:34,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you

1069
01:22:55,854 --> 01:23:24,968
[SPEAKER_06]: it says for those who present as women we we ask you to that you cover your cover your nipples and do not expose underbust cleavage is unrestricted as long as the coverage requirements are met and in the bolded and it is clear that the streamer is wearing clothing no under boob that's what they're saying right no under save save that for the what was the hot tub pools hot tubs and beaches they know what that category is come on like come on

1070
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:30,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, it'll be a mess until the next meta comes out.

1071
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:33,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they do something else.

1072
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:40,780
[SPEAKER_06]: They roll it back again, because someone will find a way to do something mirrors or at least smoke in mirrors, you know?

1073
01:23:42,882 --> 01:23:48,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't envy the people trying to police the content on Twitch because this is exactly what happens.

1074
01:23:48,046 --> 01:23:58,695
[SPEAKER_07]: You make the rules one way and people push the envelope as far as they can, but then if you make a rule that's too much, then people complain that you're doing too much.

1075
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:22,216
[SPEAKER_06]: it's still like it's still ridiculous anyways because you know they the rules that they have right now regarding like wearing bikinis and stuff like that they're like well only if it's a hot tub stream and so they will count it as a hot tub stream if you have a kiddie pool in your your bedroom or something like that that's counted because there's a there's a tub in view

1076
01:24:22,876 --> 01:24:46,076
[SPEAKER_07]: or something like that even though clearly we're gonna do a hot tub not not we I wouldn't loop you all in this but we were gonna do a hot tub stream as a VOG point reward because Grandpa Warcraft or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling has a hot tub up at his up at his cabin so I was like oh wait do you have do you have fast internet out here we could do a hot tub stream talking about World of Warcraft that'd be fun yeah it's just I don't know it's

1077
01:24:47,202 --> 01:24:55,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird, but it's it's because they don't have a dedicated adult category is why you have it seeping into everything.

1078
01:24:55,889 --> 01:25:05,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, like, because they don't crack down on it, like that's why it's still pervasive, because they're making tons of money off of it, probably.

1079
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:12,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And until someone calls them out, or their, you know, advertising partners call them out on it, they're not gonna do anything.

1080
01:25:14,551 --> 01:25:15,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

1081
01:25:15,091 --> 01:25:19,515
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerKlaw in chat says, remember when Twitch used to be about gaming and now look at this mess.

1082
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:22,698
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have kept JustinTV for all the real life stuff.

1083
01:25:22,698 --> 01:25:25,881
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember, go back to the episode right after TwitchCon.

1084
01:25:25,881 --> 01:25:34,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to a panel with the old JustinTV founders and some of the new faces at Twitch as well that are, and I actually asked a question.

1085
01:25:34,548 --> 01:25:40,954
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't, I don't think this was streamed on Twitch or anything, so you had to be in the room, but I actually asked a question and I said some of the effect of like,

1086
01:25:42,014 --> 01:25:50,598
[SPEAKER_07]: How did that journey happen where JustinTV was about real life stuff and then it kind of pivoted to Twitch and then it went back to basically doing real life stuff but now on Twitch?

1087
01:25:50,598 --> 01:25:57,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And in short, the answer I got was basically, it never really was intended to go away that you weren't supposed to be doing like real life or whatever.

1088
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It was always just a marketing thing, basically.

1089
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:04,084
[SPEAKER_07]: that they knew the audience was there with the video games and that kind of helped them get back.

1090
01:26:04,084 --> 01:26:05,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, go listen.

1091
01:26:05,385 --> 01:26:08,167
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer was better fresh in my mind on that episode.

1092
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:11,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to go back and listen to that episode after TwitchCon where I detailed it better.

1093
01:26:11,809 --> 01:26:16,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But I asked about that to the people that you would ask that about, too.

1094
01:26:16,152 --> 01:26:18,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a bummer that wasn't streamed online.

1095
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:20,572
[SPEAKER_07]: to my knowledge.

1096
01:26:20,572 --> 01:26:21,813
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1097
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:27,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about this because this is something that I think a lot of people would be very excited about.

1098
01:26:27,879 --> 01:26:30,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be a Chrono Trigger sequel.

1099
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:33,003
[SPEAKER_07]: No one hasn't been announced.

1100
01:26:33,003 --> 01:26:37,828
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, this is the time of year where we're doing a lot of interviews with folks.

1101
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:39,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So Yuji Horii

1102
01:26:39,509 --> 01:26:44,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Hironobu Sakaguchi and Kazuhiko Torishima recently got together in person.

1103
01:26:44,913 --> 01:26:49,957
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first time in 30 years, apparently, that they got together in person to have a chat.

1104
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:53,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this was like a podcast or something that they were doing or a broadcast.

1105
01:26:53,799 --> 01:27:02,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were talking about a Chrono Trigger 2, that this idea kind of came up, and it actually seemed like there was some interest in making the sequel happen.

1106
01:27:03,086 --> 01:27:06,329
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's probably unlikely.

1107
01:27:06,329 --> 01:27:10,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Torishima joked that it would be easy to do because Square Enix have now merged.

1108
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:18,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Sakaguchi was not quite as sure, but all three devs said they'd like to work on a small game with a small team.

1109
01:27:18,518 --> 01:27:22,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Sakaguchi said, let's make a simple Chrono Trigger 2.

1110
01:27:22,141 --> 01:27:26,244
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they kind of were joking about they want to make something for Switch or mobile.

1111
01:27:26,244 --> 01:27:29,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Chrono Trigger 2 would probably end up becoming much bigger.

1112
01:27:29,586 --> 01:27:33,491
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do admit it would be difficult to see them doing Chrono Trigger 2.

1113
01:27:33,491 --> 01:27:38,316
[SPEAKER_07]: If they ever did make something together again, they'd want to do something brand new.

1114
01:27:38,316 --> 01:27:42,600
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's interesting, and Fifth Dream, you're spoiling the punchline, but that's okay.

1115
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand the story's been going around.

1116
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:46,449
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot this week.

1117
01:27:46,449 --> 01:27:55,654
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually started talking about Sea of Stars, which, as you know, is a new kind of indie game that's very inspired by Chrono Trigger.

1118
01:27:55,654 --> 01:27:57,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Sea of Stars has been very greatly influenced.

1119
01:27:57,115 --> 01:28:00,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sure enough, these guys know about this game.

1120
01:28:00,837 --> 01:28:03,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Horii said the devs did a great job.

1121
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:05,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks just like Chrono Trigger.

1122
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:12,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Torishima found the game to be nostalgic, and Sakaguchi said, look, it's the same, and said the devs really did their best and did a great job.

1123
01:28:12,963 --> 01:28:13,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Toriyama?

1124
01:28:15,168 --> 01:28:16,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Kazuhiko Torishima

1125
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:51,070
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on and get to since we're taking a retro time back through time, let's let's spotlight something in our next segment.

1126
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:57,497
[SPEAKER_07]: But by the way, I do quickly want to mention, you know, we are taping a podcast, but occasionally I have to acknowledge what's going on live.

1127
01:28:57,897 --> 01:29:02,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Since Jamie already did that earlier, I will also say thank you for the hype train.

1128
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:05,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all have a random ass hype train going on in chat right now.

1129
01:29:05,364 --> 01:29:05,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

1130
01:29:05,925 --> 01:29:07,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very sweet of you to do.

1131
01:29:07,626 --> 01:29:10,228
[SPEAKER_07]: What a hell of a way to start off 2024.

1132
01:29:10,228 --> 01:29:15,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't we, why don't we bring you this segment that you've been waiting for to kick off the year?

1133
01:29:15,673 --> 01:29:15,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1134
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:34,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1135
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1136
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:45,914
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and wait, before I switch to what the game is, DarkSakura, were you inspired at all by Orange, right, on this?

1137
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:47,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like you might have been.

1138
01:29:47,434 --> 01:29:51,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, no, it's Dungeon Buster, I'm sorry, that does this on socials.

1139
01:29:51,496 --> 01:29:52,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1140
01:29:52,177 --> 01:29:54,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK, because he posts about these games a lot.

1141
01:29:54,738 --> 01:29:56,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, OK, I just I had to know.

1142
01:29:56,259 --> 01:29:59,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what was your inspiration for this week's pick?

1143
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:04,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this because I already did the original Baldur's Gate.

1144
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:05,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK, got it, got it.

1145
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:05,643
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1146
01:30:05,643 --> 01:30:06,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what is the classic game of the week then?

1147
01:30:08,177 --> 01:30:09,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Pool of Radiance!

1148
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:13,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Another T&D game.

1149
01:30:13,802 --> 01:30:22,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Pool of Radiance was published in 1988 by Strategic Simulations Inc.

1150
01:30:24,012 --> 01:30:27,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from the advanced Dungeons and Dragons.

1151
01:30:27,394 --> 01:30:35,480
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in the heyday of second edition still, which is still best edition.

1152
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:42,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first adaptation of AD&D for home computers.

1153
01:30:42,485 --> 01:30:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first episode in a four part series for Pool of Radiance.

1154
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:51,172
[SPEAKER_02]: They

1155
01:30:52,566 --> 01:30:59,789
[SPEAKER_02]: The other games came in a gold box series that used the engine that was pioneered in Pool of Radiance.

1156
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:05,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, as did later D&D titles like Neverwinter Nights online game.

1157
01:31:05,471 --> 01:31:14,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting and mostly centered around the city of Flan, a port city.

1158
01:31:14,794 --> 01:31:21,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So you start off with a party of up to six characters, you know, decide, you know, what bits are in their pants.

1159
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:27,715
[SPEAKER_02]: what people they come from, what their class is, and what their stats are.

1160
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:37,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to go help the part of the city by clearing out bandits and other forces around.

1161
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:47,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And you move from area, from one to the other, and basically you're just doing your campaign and you get your experience points like you do in standard D&D.

1162
01:31:49,073 --> 01:31:52,834
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can increase your stats for different capabilities.

1163
01:31:52,834 --> 01:32:01,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a first-person game and the screen is divided into sections that show information that's useful to you.

1164
01:32:01,937 --> 01:32:09,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, during combat it goes to top-down, quote, video game isometric view, end quote.

1165
01:32:11,002 --> 01:32:15,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go into a little bit more of the gameplay.

1166
01:32:15,105 --> 01:32:33,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who are here with us live on Twitch at VOG Network, you can see it, you know, going through the various characters and it has that classic first person, you know, sprite based going down, you know, turn the corner.

1167
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:37,258
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've played Phantasy Star, you know what I'm talking about.

1168
01:32:39,339 --> 01:32:56,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you can make your own party, you can use a generated party for those new to it, and you have two slots also for NPCs, non-player characters.

1169
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:57,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You can

1170
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: For some versions, they had ways that you could save them on your disk drive.

1171
01:33:04,922 --> 01:33:10,324
[SPEAKER_02]: On others, you would have to have a save disk, like Commodore 64 used to save disks.

1172
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:15,426
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're playing the DOS version, it definitely saved to the internal.

1173
01:33:15,426 --> 01:33:24,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, your exploration mode, as I was mentioning earlier, has that three-dimensional first-person perspective with a rectangle in the top left of the screen.

1174
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:29,854
[SPEAKER_02]: displaying what the party is looking at.

1175
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:38,662
[SPEAKER_02]: You have different menus, you can see your attributes, you can see character sheets, you can see all kinds of stuff.

1176
01:33:38,662 --> 01:33:48,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You have three different versions of each sprite as well to differentiate short, medium, and long range encounters.

1177
01:33:48,351 --> 01:33:50,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your spell list, you have all kinds of stuff.

1178
01:33:51,833 --> 01:34:07,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and of course, as I said, it goes to a top-down, uh, diametric, uh, view, uh, projection, where you can look at where the characters are, put them in the right place, talk strategy, all of that.

1179
01:34:07,159 --> 01:34:12,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, of course, you get an extra attack when enemies are retreating, which I think is awesome.

1180
01:34:12,801 --> 01:34:16,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, let me stab you in the back on your way out, or the door hit you in the ass.

1181
01:34:17,743 --> 01:34:26,970
[SPEAKER_02]: If a character's HP falls below zero, then you have to be bandaged by another character or you die.

1182
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The game has random encounters, of course, and Dragon Magazine, which

1183
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:48,182
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't remember Dragon Magazine, it was the magazine for all things D&D, fantasy universe, you named it.

1184
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:52,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good tie-ins with various TSR properties.

1185
01:34:54,998 --> 01:35:12,608
[SPEAKER_02]: but one of their game reviewers said that the random encounters follow the standard patterns for encounter tables in tabletop D&D manuals and that the monster depictions basically were exactly what they were in the monster manual.

1186
01:35:14,048 --> 01:35:16,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got different combat options based on your class.

1187
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:30,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So fighters can do melee or ranged magic, users cast spells, thieves have backstab, sneak, fight, you know, basically, you just keep going, you know, normal, normal stuff.

1188
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:37,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, for spellcasters, you have to spend time nightly to memorize your spells.

1189
01:35:40,164 --> 01:35:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: As you go through, you get XP and you can level up to become more powerful.

1190
01:35:46,488 --> 01:35:49,950
[SPEAKER_02]: It had some interesting copy protection in it.

1191
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:56,775
[SPEAKER_02]: The DOS, Mac, and Apple II versions of Pool of Radiance had a two-ply code wheel.

1192
01:35:56,775 --> 01:36:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like those old decoders that you would get in your cereal boxes back in the day when people still gave a shit about decoders?

1193
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:05,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like some Sierra games had the wheels too.

1194
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:06,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1195
01:36:06,781 --> 01:36:07,802
[SPEAKER_02]: LucasArts did a lot.

1196
01:36:09,737 --> 01:36:16,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It was used for translating Elvish and Dwarven runes, and some Dwarven runes had different translations.

1197
01:36:16,459 --> 01:36:29,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the title screen, it would come up with two runes in a varying line, like dotted, dashed, or whatever, that corresponded to the markings on your code wheel.

1198
01:36:29,023 --> 01:36:33,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would enter a five or six character code that corresponded to all of that.

1199
01:36:37,757 --> 01:36:42,918
[SPEAKER_02]: then that would be how you would unlock the game for use.

1200
01:36:42,918 --> 01:36:50,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in the DOS version, Pool of Radiance, the code wheel is used for some in-game puzzles.

1201
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:58,482
[SPEAKER_02]: In the NES version, the Elvish words are given to you deciphered, so you don't have a code wheel for the NES version.

1202
01:36:58,482 --> 01:37:00,503
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically,

1203
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:10,958
[SPEAKER_02]: In the land of Flan, you're on the Moonsea shore.

1204
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you're starting a new Flan, an area of that, and just basically having to protect the city and help it grow and, you know.

1205
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:27,574
[SPEAKER_02]: work for them and you have different gods in the city and their temples can heal you depending on how you are.

1206
01:37:27,574 --> 01:37:32,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them require money, because of course they do.

1207
01:37:32,396 --> 01:37:36,518
[SPEAKER_02]: You also can hire NPCs to go with the party.

1208
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:48,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, you know, you go to the tavern and listen to gossip and drink and it's like...

1209
01:37:49,082 --> 01:37:50,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I in the tavern?

1210
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:52,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're in the tavern.

1211
01:37:52,227 --> 01:37:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, I get drunk.

1212
01:37:54,331 --> 01:37:56,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That too.

1213
01:37:56,535 --> 01:38:00,121
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any chicks there, I want to do them.

1214
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:00,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1215
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:13,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but basically, going back to a little bit of history on the game, and I know I have been talking at length about this already, but this game is very important in gaming history.

1216
01:38:13,098 --> 01:38:17,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, again, the first official game based off AD&D rules.

1217
01:38:17,721 --> 01:38:30,350
[SPEAKER_02]: The scenario was created by TSR designers Jim Ward, David Cook, Steve Winter, and Mike Brault, I always mispronounce his name, and then the programmers from SSI's team.

1218
01:38:32,044 --> 01:38:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game was created on an Apple II and Commodore 64 computers in one year with a team of 35 people.

1219
01:38:43,915 --> 01:38:50,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first to use this game engine known as the Gold Box.

1220
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:55,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really followed quite well the AD&D rules, the second edition rules.

1221
01:38:58,496 --> 01:39:05,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It used a lot of the Unearthed Arcana and the Monster Manual 2 that was used in development.

1222
01:39:05,778 --> 01:39:21,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And, honestly enough, you know, the Pool of Radiance series, not only did it come out originally on Commodore 64, Apple II series, and IBM PCs, it came out on Atari ST.

1223
01:39:21,343 --> 01:39:22,924
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Mac version in 1989.

1224
01:39:24,424 --> 01:39:32,990
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a slightly different interface and was meant to also work on black and white Macs like the Mac Plus and Mac Classic.

1225
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:34,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Different tiles.

1226
01:39:34,751 --> 01:39:38,333
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an Amiga version that came out.

1227
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:43,396
[SPEAKER_02]: PC-9800 version.

1228
01:39:43,396 --> 01:39:47,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fully translated in Japanese and had full-color graphics.

1229
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:51,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ported to the NES under the title Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Pool of Radiance.

1230
01:39:51,702 --> 01:39:52,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out in April 1992.

1231
01:39:54,424 --> 01:40:04,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The NES version had a full soundtrack that was composed by Toda Seiji, who was signed to Pony Canyon.

1232
01:40:04,271 --> 01:40:09,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The soundtrack was also on the PC-9801 version.

1233
01:40:09,255 --> 01:40:11,597
[SPEAKER_02]: The Amiga version had some extra music.

1234
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:32,025
[SPEAKER_02]: but the game shipped with a 28 page booklet that described some secrets in playing the game and concepts behind it and it had, you know, just showed you how to create the party and also had a 38 page adventurer's journal which gave more background on the game

1235
01:40:33,065 --> 01:40:35,986
[SPEAKER_02]: had maps and all kinds of information.

1236
01:40:35,986 --> 01:40:51,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It did spawn three direct sequels, Curse of the Azure Bonds in 89, Secrets of the Silver Blades in 1990, and Pools of Darkness in 1991, which I think is the one maybe most people know of as Pools of Darkness.

1237
01:40:51,472 --> 01:40:58,334
[SPEAKER_02]: 1989 game Hillsfar was also made by SSI, but not a sequel to Pool of Radiance, but it was inspired.

1238
01:41:02,785 --> 01:41:06,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very detailed and very amazing for its day.

1239
01:41:06,628 --> 01:41:18,156
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, keep in mind, these games were at the time being run on like Pentium, I think it was a Pentium 2, Pentium 3 around the time.

1240
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:22,400
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it had to have been a Pentium 2.

1241
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I have to go look at my history again.

1242
01:41:24,781 --> 01:41:26,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about the Pentiums, baby.

1243
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:41,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, in 1988, uh, the module Ruins of Adventure was created using the same scenario for Pool of Radiance, same plot background setting, you name it.

1244
01:41:41,447 --> 01:41:49,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the module also gave clues to completing the computer missions.

1245
01:41:49,629 --> 01:41:57,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the Ruins of Adventure had four linked mini scenarios, which were the core Pool of Radiance and then, um,

1246
01:41:59,429 --> 01:42:17,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Drakken said that Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, not vice versa, but Mike Brouillat stated that they were chosen directly to write for Pool of Radiance, and so the game came first.

1247
01:42:17,552 --> 01:42:26,974
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1989, there's a novelization of Pool of Radiance that was called Pool of Radiance, published by TSR in their Forgotten Realms series.

1248
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first in a trilogy, there was Pools of Darkness and Pool of Twilight.

1249
01:42:34,876 --> 01:42:44,007
[SPEAKER_02]: GOG has released Pool of Radiance and many of the Gold Box games digitally on August 20, 2015 as part of the Forgotten Realms, the Archives.

1250
01:42:44,007 --> 01:42:46,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam also released Pool of Radiance in 2022.

1251
01:42:50,835 --> 01:43:06,296
[SPEAKER_02]: SSI sold 264,536 copies for North America when it came out, and that was three times that of Heroes of the Lance, which was, I believe, the Dragonlance one, I'd have to say.

1252
01:43:06,724 --> 01:43:09,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the Dragonlance campaign.

1253
01:43:09,546 --> 01:43:14,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hint book outsold any earlier game.

1254
01:43:14,749 --> 01:43:17,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was very well received.

1255
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:21,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Magazine gave it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.

1256
01:43:21,112 --> 01:43:23,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Amiga Action, 79%.

1257
01:43:23,113 --> 01:43:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Commodore User, 9 out of 10.

1258
01:43:25,615 --> 01:43:33,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it also won an Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988.

1259
01:43:37,762 --> 01:43:42,045
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some mixed reviews for some of the other versions.

1260
01:43:42,045 --> 01:43:50,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people just didn't care for having it on a computer to begin with, and that colored their review.

1261
01:43:50,931 --> 01:43:54,473
[SPEAKER_02]: They also found that there were speed issues.

1262
01:43:54,473 --> 01:44:01,438
[SPEAKER_02]: The DOS version was really fast, so much that they had to slow the game down to be able to read on-screen messages.

1263
01:44:01,918 --> 01:44:12,787
[SPEAKER_02]: The DOS version played at twice the speed of Commodore 64 or 128 version when using the EGA graphics mode.

1264
01:44:12,787 --> 01:44:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, there's a lot more history about it.

1265
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:17,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It won so many awards.

1266
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:21,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was something that set the pace.

1267
01:44:21,594 --> 01:44:29,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 1990, it received the fifth highest number of votes in the survey of computer gaming world all time favorites.

1268
01:44:30,402 --> 01:44:38,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been ranked by IGN as number 3 on their list of top 11 Dungeons & Dragons games of all time in 2014.

1269
01:44:38,926 --> 01:44:44,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it really did set the pace, you know?

1270
01:44:44,808 --> 01:44:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the big thing that

1271
01:44:48,252 --> 01:44:54,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the big one that I played was Pool of Radiance, Ruins of Mithdranor.

1272
01:44:54,316 --> 01:45:03,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a lot of that one, and I have, like, the... Well, actually, I think I loaned the manual to somebody, and I don't know where it is now.

1273
01:45:03,763 --> 01:45:08,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had, like, the full box set that came with the player's guide and everything.

1274
01:45:08,406 --> 01:45:11,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I love that they were able to put these things together.

1275
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:16,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it, the one that started it, Pool of Radiance.

1276
01:45:16,171 --> 01:45:16,912
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1277
01:45:16,912 --> 01:45:17,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Great pick.

1278
01:45:17,392 --> 01:45:19,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, I remember my Thaco.

1279
01:45:19,893 --> 01:45:20,273
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1280
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:28,537
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see Thaco on the screen, as Bobbi's pointing out, and some of the kind of transitions as they're walking around and managing their inventory and doing all this.

1281
01:45:28,537 --> 01:45:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll translate for the babies.

1282
01:45:30,778 --> 01:45:32,859
[SPEAKER_02]: To hit armor class zero.

1283
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:46,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Pool of Radiance, your classic game of the week, and really one of the all-time classics, to be quite honest, picking a heck of a thing to start off 2024.

1284
01:45:46,943 --> 01:45:53,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're gonna check out some other news very quick, and then we just have a couple other headlines here.

1285
01:45:53,564 --> 01:46:03,526
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still pretty early in the year, so we don't have a ton of news, but there's been a bit to catch up on over the past couple weeks, so we still have just a few more things, including some quick headlines, and we will start with Loki.

1286
01:46:04,502 --> 01:46:19,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, speaking of something tangentially related to Dungeons & Dragons, I mean, I guess it is technically Dungeons & Dragons, but Baldur's Gate 3, folks are getting banned, or I should say, getting, having their clips flagged on Xbox.

1287
01:46:21,431 --> 01:46:24,932
[SPEAKER_06]: if they contain, you know, some spicy gameplay in there.

1288
01:46:24,932 --> 01:46:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So now Lorian Studios has worked with Microsoft to get those clips unbanned.

1289
01:46:33,795 --> 01:46:47,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the meantime, they said that if you want to upload any clips, make sure to turn off mature content so that, you know, it doesn't come across and you don't have your account be in jeopardy there.

1290
01:46:48,494 --> 01:46:52,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I had to unpublish mine because I accidentally showed bits.

1291
01:46:52,595 --> 01:47:00,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I will also on a somewhat related but funny note that I saw come across social media, because, you know, Awesome Games Done Quick is coming up next week.

1292
01:47:00,316 --> 01:47:02,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's speed runs, lots of speed runs.

1293
01:47:02,656 --> 01:47:06,897
[SPEAKER_07]: One speed run you will not be seeing there is the one that I just saw on YouTube.

1294
01:47:06,897 --> 01:47:11,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a it was a sex run in Baldur's Gate.

1295
01:47:11,278 --> 01:47:15,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was somebody unlocking sex as fast as they could in the game.

1296
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:17,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was like two minutes.

1297
01:47:18,476 --> 01:47:19,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they got it done.

1298
01:47:19,376 --> 01:47:25,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they got sex in under two minutes, which is how long some guys last.

1299
01:47:25,197 --> 01:47:28,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1300
01:47:28,658 --> 01:47:33,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, Game Pass, adding some new games in January, obviously.

1301
01:47:33,399 --> 01:47:38,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the games coming to Game Pass this month, we have Hell Let Loose.

1302
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,781
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on cloud PC and the Xbox series.

1303
01:47:41,781 --> 01:47:43,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

1304
01:47:46,212 --> 01:48:05,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Figment, SuperMegaBaseball4, WeHappyFew, Resident Evil 2, Those Who Remain, Dead by Daylight, Chucky Update, Hello Neighbor 2 Anniversary, Sea of Thieves Season 10

1305
01:48:14,972 --> 01:48:17,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes and goes.

1306
01:48:17,114 --> 01:48:27,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Garden Story, MotoGP 22, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 3 Portable are also leaving this month as well.

1307
01:48:27,926 --> 01:48:30,108
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1308
01:48:30,108 --> 01:48:30,489
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1309
01:48:33,083 --> 01:48:38,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, oh goodness, I had the frog in my throat.

1310
01:48:38,386 --> 01:48:53,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we have the next, uh, Stern Pinball release, and that's going to be da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-

1311
01:48:57,449 --> 01:49:23,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there's going to be a little bit more information coming out, but right now they've just made their big... They're going to be showing more off between January 9th and 12th at the Consumer Electronics Expo in Las Vegas.

1312
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:24,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to be there.

1313
01:49:28,318 --> 01:49:33,435
[SPEAKER_02]: People are already sure that it's already in production, so we'll see what happens.

1314
01:49:35,842 --> 01:49:37,322
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1315
01:49:37,322 --> 01:49:45,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And one more story for you is about a classic game that dates all the way back to the Atari Lynx is being redone for the Nintendo Switch.

1316
01:49:45,885 --> 01:49:47,805
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Chips Challenge.

1317
01:49:47,805 --> 01:49:48,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I remember Chips.

1318
01:49:48,806 --> 01:49:49,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

1319
01:49:49,506 --> 01:49:59,169
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out originally in 1989 for the Atari Lynx, and it's going to be coming out on January 25th, 2024 for the Nintendo Switch.

1320
01:49:59,169 --> 01:50:01,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the classic puzzle game from 1989 with over 140 levels.

1321
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:14,293
[SPEAKER_07]: This collection will let you play the classic game, but with new features, including display filters, such as LCD and CRT filters, save games, and then right and left-handed control presets.

1322
01:50:14,293 --> 01:50:18,854
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, interesting fun fact, and I think I've mentioned this on the show before, I actually know the guy that made this game.

1323
01:50:18,854 --> 01:50:26,916
[SPEAKER_07]: The original, Chuck is his name, he made this game on the Atari Lynx back in the day, and you know, this game's kind of been everywhere since then, because it had all these different ports.

1324
01:50:27,636 --> 01:50:28,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Really nice guy.

1325
01:50:28,457 --> 01:50:31,959
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't really... He's not really connected to video games.

1326
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:35,101
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not really connected with the gaming industry anymore.

1327
01:50:35,101 --> 01:50:40,124
[SPEAKER_07]: He said to me some just things that I think he's just kind of not with it anymore.

1328
01:50:40,124 --> 01:50:44,447
[SPEAKER_07]: But he does some really cool... He does a lot of cool, like, lighting stuff now, actually.

1329
01:50:44,447 --> 01:50:46,368
[SPEAKER_07]: He does, like, exhibits for Burning Man.

1330
01:50:46,368 --> 01:50:48,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've actually showed some of them downtown.

1331
01:50:48,069 --> 01:50:52,792
[SPEAKER_07]: If you saw, like, that light wall by the Golden One downtown last year, it was up for a few months.

1332
01:50:52,792 --> 01:50:53,492
[SPEAKER_07]: He did that.

1333
01:50:53,492 --> 01:50:55,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So he does a lot of really cool light exhibits now.

1334
01:50:55,494 --> 01:50:55,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of...

1335
01:50:56,714 --> 01:51:06,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess maybe interesting kind of thing that here comes that game coming up again on the Nintendo Switch.

1336
01:51:06,184 --> 01:51:07,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Some games last a very long time.

1337
01:51:07,865 --> 01:51:09,547
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

1338
01:51:09,547 --> 01:51:11,188
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on.

1339
01:51:11,188 --> 01:51:15,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's travel around the world and check out some other new games that are coming out in the coming week.

1340
01:51:15,473 --> 01:51:19,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I don't know if there will be a lot this early in the year, but I'll check in anyway.

1341
01:51:19,737 --> 01:51:19,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1342
01:51:20,902 --> 01:51:27,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I was going to mention with Chip's Challenge, the thing, I didn't remember this from the actual Atari Lynx.

1343
01:51:27,044 --> 01:51:31,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got it with the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

1344
01:51:31,866 --> 01:51:33,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?

1345
01:51:33,407 --> 01:51:33,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

1346
01:51:33,867 --> 01:51:36,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's how a lot of people played it, to be honest.

1347
01:51:36,667 --> 01:51:39,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, so this is pretty cool.

1348
01:51:39,228 --> 01:51:41,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have a few things coming out this week.

1349
01:51:41,629 --> 01:51:48,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a whole lot, but we have, looks like Laika, Aged Through Blood on Nintendo Switch.

1352

1353
01:52:05,936 --> 01:52:10,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystal Story, Dawn of Dusk on PC.

1354
01:52:10,197 --> 01:52:12,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And that actually is it.

1355
01:52:14,871 --> 01:52:19,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's head over to Japan and check out the releases coming out there.

1356
01:52:19,754 --> 01:52:21,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we have an awful lot this week.

1357
01:52:21,674 --> 01:52:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually we have a little bit on the 11th.

1358
01:52:24,496 --> 01:52:35,141
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Gungrave Gore, that's G-O-R-E, is coming out on the Nintendo Switch in Enhanced Edition and Limited Edition, because you know we love our Limited Editions and such in Japan.

1359
01:52:35,821 --> 01:52:40,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Football Manager coming out in Japan on January the 12th.

1360
01:52:40,023 --> 01:52:43,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is what you have to look forward to on the Nintendo Switch.

1361
01:52:43,044 --> 01:52:47,566
[SPEAKER_07]: On the PlayStation 5, that Football Manager game also being released in Japan.

1362
01:52:47,566 --> 01:52:49,447
[SPEAKER_07]: That is really it.

1363
01:52:49,447 --> 01:52:53,088
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Europe, DarkSakura?

1364
01:52:53,088 --> 01:52:53,909
[SPEAKER_02]: One.

1365
01:52:53,909 --> 01:52:55,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on PlayStation and Xbox.

1366
01:52:55,830 --> 01:53:00,592
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out the 11th, War Hospital Deluxe Edition.

1367
01:53:00,592 --> 01:53:01,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting.

1368
01:53:01,332 --> 01:53:01,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1369
01:53:02,657 --> 01:53:09,140
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we have just a few more stories for you, and then we'll invite your comments and topics and all that good stuff.

1370
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:11,761
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki's got a couple other headlines to talk about.

1371
01:53:11,761 --> 01:53:13,442
[SPEAKER_07]: These are both kind of some big stories, too.

1372
01:53:13,442 --> 01:53:14,203
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make sure.

1373
01:53:14,203 --> 01:53:16,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1374
01:53:16,184 --> 01:53:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1375
01:53:18,065 --> 01:53:29,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that there's surprisingly coming out very soon, and I'm surprised we haven't seen anything about it yet, but the Minecraft movie is supposed to be coming out this year.

1376
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:39,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think it may be pushed back a little bit later, but I thought it was coming out in March.

1377
01:53:39,555 --> 01:53:41,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's pretty close.

1378
01:53:41,876 --> 01:53:43,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Why live action?

1379
01:53:43,858 --> 01:53:44,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1380
01:53:44,638 --> 01:53:47,501
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sounds awful as a live action movie.

1381
01:53:47,501 --> 01:53:52,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that they had casted Jason Momoa in it for some reason.

1382
01:53:52,984 --> 01:53:58,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And now Jack Black is set to play Steve in the Minecraft movie.

1383
01:53:59,864 --> 01:54:02,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how, like, like, don't get me wrong.

1384
01:54:02,885 --> 01:54:04,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Jack Black.

1385
01:54:04,685 --> 01:54:10,966
[SPEAKER_06]: He would work as as an animated movie would work as him playing Steve.

1386
01:54:10,966 --> 01:54:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not see him as a Steve in a live action Minecraft.

1387
01:54:14,787 --> 01:54:18,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't feel like it makes any sense.

1388
01:54:18,648 --> 01:54:20,028
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, Loki, it could have been worse.

1389
01:54:20,028 --> 01:54:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have been Timothee Chalamet or something like that.

1390
01:54:22,448 --> 01:54:25,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, Jack Black, I think they could have done a lot worse.

1391
01:54:26,736 --> 01:54:28,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1392
01:54:28,077 --> 01:54:30,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he'll bring enthusiasm to the role, though.

1393
01:54:30,499 --> 01:54:31,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure.

1394
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:33,802
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll have a respect for the source material.

1395
01:54:33,802 --> 01:54:41,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, it's one of those things like the idea of a Minecraft movie, like an animated movie, makes a whole ton of sense to me.

1396
01:54:41,988 --> 01:54:45,011
[SPEAKER_06]: A live action Minecraft movie makes no sense to me.

1397
01:54:45,011 --> 01:54:53,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And hearing Jack Black and Jason Momoa makes me think of like the new Jumanji type thing where it's like, oh, we got sucked into a video game type thing.

1398
01:54:53,377 --> 01:54:53,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And like,

1399
01:54:54,418 --> 01:55:18,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly hope that's not what it is because I mean one it's incredibly derivative and two it's Jack Black is in the Jumanji movie and that's the premise of that too so it's like okay you can't do that again I mean you can but like this was it I think this is a Warner Brothers movie too if I remember correctly so you're gonna cancel all those other movies but not this I mean I don't know we'll see

1400
01:55:21,654 --> 01:55:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt going straight for the heart saying I raise your Timothee Chalamet with Jared Leto.

1401
01:55:30,182 --> 01:55:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how Tron fans are grieving right now?

1402
01:55:34,465 --> 01:55:37,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what it's like to be a Tron fan right now?

1403
01:55:37,188 --> 01:55:39,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, Yuri's actor.

1404
01:55:42,608 --> 01:55:44,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's that too.

1405
01:55:44,589 --> 01:55:47,089
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also horrible news.

1406
01:55:47,089 --> 01:55:51,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she passed, but Jared Leto is going to be in the third movie.

1407
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:52,771
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1408
01:55:52,771 --> 01:55:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1409
01:55:53,051 --> 01:55:54,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that came out a while ago.

1410
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:57,172
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, OK, here's the thing.

1411
01:55:57,172 --> 01:56:01,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't really hate him so much in movies.

1412
01:56:01,494 --> 01:56:02,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just cool to hate on him.

1413
01:56:04,193 --> 01:56:06,414
[SPEAKER_06]: You just haven't watched his movies, have you?

1414
01:56:06,414 --> 01:56:06,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

1415
01:56:06,774 --> 01:56:10,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I actually was kind of into him as Joker in Suicide Squad.

1416
01:56:10,696 --> 01:56:12,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Big fan of the Morbius.

1417
01:56:12,376 --> 01:56:16,398
[SPEAKER_07]: We're way, we're way in distance from my so-called life now.

1418
01:56:16,398 --> 01:56:20,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to be clear.

1419
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:20,840
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1420
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:27,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I didn't have a problem with him as Joker in, in the Suicide Squad movie, other than he didn't even need to be in the movie, but like.

1421
01:56:27,803 --> 01:56:28,603
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1422
01:56:28,603 --> 01:56:33,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, then they just like, let's not pretend that movie ever happened and we'll just do it again, you know?

1423
01:56:34,312 --> 01:56:45,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um... I don't know, like... I'll see it anyways, it's gonna be garbage, cause I gotta see whether it's gonna be garbage or not.

1424
01:56:45,003 --> 01:56:48,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... You're watching- you're waiting for the trainwreck to happen.

1425
01:56:48,486 --> 01:56:49,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna hate watching it.

1426
01:56:49,107 --> 01:56:52,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I am waiting for- I am gonna hate watching it, but like, yeah, it's just- it's...

1427
01:56:53,447 --> 01:56:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to see a trailer of it.

1428
01:56:54,948 --> 01:57:00,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just right now, like, assuming that it's coming out... How is it coming out in March?

1429
01:57:00,231 --> 01:57:02,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like they haven't even shot a frame of it yet.

1430
01:57:02,152 --> 01:57:03,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's impossible.

1431
01:57:03,413 --> 01:57:03,713
[SPEAKER_07]: March 2025?

1432
01:57:03,713 --> 01:57:08,856
[SPEAKER_07]: How much of it's going to be CG and green screen?

1433
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be pretty soon.

1434
01:57:13,126 --> 01:57:15,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love a Tron movie for my birthday, but I don't know so much.

1435
01:57:29,502 --> 01:57:31,884
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he's Matt still talking about Minecraft.

1436
01:57:31,884 --> 01:57:40,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when the Tron one is being done, but they did after right after the writer's strike wrapped up or the I'm sorry, the actor's strike wrapped up.

1437
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:51,257
[SPEAKER_07]: They confirmed that because one of the big stories when the writer's strike happened was that they laid people off that were working on Tron because they were unable to finish it.

1438
01:57:51,257 --> 01:57:53,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But then once they got that resolved, they're picking it up again.

1439
01:57:53,638 --> 01:57:55,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're making casting announcements.

1440
01:57:55,139 --> 01:57:56,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's Jared Leto?

1441
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:59,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a play in the Tron movie, like

1442
01:58:00,302 --> 01:58:03,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think Garrett Hedlund is back in it.

1443
01:58:03,024 --> 01:58:08,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's taking place in a completely different... I don't know.

1444
01:58:08,187 --> 01:58:09,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I have concerns, but we'll see.

1445
01:58:09,568 --> 01:58:14,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I will hate watch it just like Loki hate watches Minecraft because at least it's Tron.

1446
01:58:17,152 --> 01:58:19,695
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no Daft Punk to do the score.

1447
01:58:34,109 --> 01:58:39,431
[SPEAKER_06]: the Oasis from Ready Player One to make that.

1448
01:58:39,431 --> 01:58:43,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you're talking about a company, like, really, we're gonna trust Warner Brothers with this?

1449
01:58:43,952 --> 01:58:48,474
[SPEAKER_06]: The company that, like, just eats up other companies and then cancels all their products and, like, all that stuff?

1450
01:58:48,474 --> 01:58:50,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are we really gonna do that?

1451
01:58:50,594 --> 01:58:52,315
[SPEAKER_07]: One word, three letters.

1452
01:58:52,315 --> 01:58:54,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Matrix MMO.

1453
01:58:54,636 --> 01:58:55,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Flop.

1454
01:58:57,203 --> 01:59:24,873
[SPEAKER_06]: it's also like it's like you don't like did you read the book like do you not recognize yourselves as IOI like the the company that's basically this big corporation looking to monetize the whole thing in the first place like of course not because they're everybody's looking at fortnite now and everybody wants to be the next fortnite yeah but what was the last good warner brothers game mortal kombat one yeah okay fine that's that's more nether realm that they're like you know like if

1455
01:59:27,367 --> 01:59:29,128
[SPEAKER_06]: just any of their properties, though.

1456
01:59:29,128 --> 01:59:36,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, I'm just some would say the wizard boy game.

1457
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:39,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It it sold it sold copies.

1458
01:59:39,294 --> 01:59:48,579
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just leave it at that, you know, but if I if I am to things happened in relation to it, if I am to take your question seriously, I would have to give you that serious answer.

1459
01:59:48,579 --> 01:59:50,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1460
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:51,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't trust them.

1461
01:59:52,642 --> 01:59:53,963
[SPEAKER_07]: City of Heroes

1462
02:00:11,912 --> 02:00:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so apparently City of Heroes, obviously, was shut down a long time ago, back in 2012.

1463
02:00:21,456 --> 02:00:30,899
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was some unofficial private servers running the game, and that had been existing for years afterwards.

1464
02:00:30,899 --> 02:00:36,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, one of those, of course, is a part of, was it the Homecoming?

1465
02:00:36,241 --> 02:00:39,802
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this unofficial fan-run project called Homecoming.

1466
02:00:42,244 --> 02:00:46,869
[SPEAKER_06]: announced that NCSoft had no plans to kill City of Heroes' private server.

1467
02:00:46,869 --> 02:00:55,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, the company is providing the devs with an official license to maintain the City of Heroes' server.

1468
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're coming out and endorsing it, basically, allowing them to continue it on.

1469
02:01:01,347 --> 02:01:02,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think is pretty awesome.

1470
02:01:02,168 --> 02:01:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Homecoming has been granted a license to operate as a City of Heroes server and further develop the game.

1471
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:19,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Subject to conditions and limitations of the contract, but as between us and NCSoft, NCSoft still owns City of Heroes intellectual property and its derivatives.

1472
02:01:19,195 --> 02:01:22,536
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least they're going to be allowed to continue, you know,

1473
02:01:23,556 --> 02:01:28,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Developing the game, I guess, to add enhancements where need be and stuff like that.

1474
02:01:28,105 --> 02:01:29,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

1475
02:01:29,087 --> 02:01:31,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Years late, but it's still pretty cool.

1476
02:01:31,432 --> 02:01:32,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still pretty cool.

1477
02:01:32,113 --> 02:01:32,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1478
02:01:32,434 --> 02:01:32,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1479
02:01:33,735 --> 02:01:52,742

1490
02:02:32,602 --> 02:02:33,042
[SPEAKER_07]: chat.

1491
02:02:33,042 --> 02:02:41,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that if you don't know Slaggy, he hosted a show that used to be on this network called the Gamebuoy.org podcast.

1492
02:02:41,046 --> 02:02:46,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting for them to come back and I hope they do someday and will still join us on the network when they do.

1493
02:02:46,388 --> 02:02:55,531
[SPEAKER_07]: But Slaggy has rebranded his Twitch presence because I was joking that Slaggy rebrands more often than Madonna.

1494
02:02:55,531 --> 02:02:56,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So Slaggy was going by

1495
02:02:58,004 --> 02:02:58,244
[SPEAKER_07]: and Slaggy!

1496
02:03:20,133 --> 02:03:25,455
[SPEAKER_07]: HotPocketTree, which is, I love that name by the way, says in chat, I made friends with a moth.

1497
02:03:25,455 --> 02:03:27,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that cool?

1498
02:03:27,435 --> 02:03:27,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

1499
02:03:27,776 --> 02:03:29,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Only if it's a photogenic moth.

1500
02:03:29,016 --> 02:03:31,817
[SPEAKER_02]: What if it's one of those big gigantic moths?

1501
02:03:31,817 --> 02:03:33,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are awesome.

1502
02:03:33,677 --> 02:03:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Mothman.

1503
02:03:34,638 --> 02:03:36,478
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be a little bit scary.

1504
02:03:36,478 --> 02:03:41,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully not the kind of moth that you saw in the Silence of the Lambs, because that was creepy.

1505
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:43,881
[SPEAKER_07]: But as long as otherwise the moth wasn't hurting anyone.

1506
02:03:43,881 --> 02:03:44,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Mothra.

1507
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:45,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Mothra, yeah.

1508
02:03:45,921 --> 02:03:47,442
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was Mothra, then awesome.

1509
02:03:50,846 --> 02:03:54,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, DarkTutsuya says, did we talk about Loki's game this week?

1510
02:03:54,848 --> 02:03:57,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's one near and dear to my heart at least.

1511
02:03:57,349 --> 02:04:00,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this which what what are we Loki's game?

1512
02:04:00,151 --> 02:04:02,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking about the one you're developing for the playdate?

1513
02:04:02,915 --> 02:04:04,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not developing anything yet.

1514
02:04:04,176 --> 02:04:08,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just sitting here looking at the playdate and occasionally downloading stuff to it.

1515
02:04:08,359 --> 02:04:12,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so so it's in its conceptual stage only.

1516
02:04:12,842 --> 02:04:18,046
[SPEAKER_07]: We will let you know when shooting has commenced on that product.

1517
02:04:18,046 --> 02:04:20,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Dr. C is talking about the game in the background.

1518
02:04:20,488 --> 02:04:21,028
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

1519
02:04:21,028 --> 02:04:22,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't check this in the beginning of the show.

1520
02:04:22,990 --> 02:04:25,792
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have a game playing behind you.

1521
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:27,473
[SPEAKER_07]: As you often do when we're taping our show.

1522
02:04:28,362 --> 02:04:29,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1523
02:04:29,903 --> 02:04:34,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It is only because I couldn't really think of what I wanted to put in the background.

1524
02:04:34,646 --> 02:04:37,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, okay, I'd like to see like a racing game.

1525
02:04:37,388 --> 02:04:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 6.

1526
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:42,191
[SPEAKER_07]: What a good soundtrack.

1527
02:04:42,191 --> 02:04:43,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Only because the soundtracks are awesome.

1528
02:04:43,992 --> 02:04:45,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, soundtracks, those games are always great.

1529
02:04:45,753 --> 02:04:48,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I don't know if I've listened all the way to six.

1530
02:04:48,615 --> 02:04:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: But the first three, I definitely have done that.

1531
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's cool.

1532
02:04:53,318 --> 02:04:54,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

1533
02:04:54,559 --> 02:04:57,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Any last minute stories or other topics to bring up tonight, Loki?

1534
02:04:59,609 --> 02:05:00,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, no.

1535
02:05:01,468 --> 02:05:02,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1536
02:05:02,729 --> 02:05:05,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been it's been one of those weeks.

1537
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:08,131
[SPEAKER_07]: sj100mad is saying, Are we doing predictions again this year?

1538
02:05:08,131 --> 02:05:09,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a good thought.

1539
02:05:09,612 --> 02:05:11,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, we should have looked at those.

1540
02:05:11,253 --> 02:05:12,153
[SPEAKER_06]: We did those last year.

1541
02:05:12,153 --> 02:05:15,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think we I think I have them.

1542
02:05:15,094 --> 02:05:15,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's do it.

1543
02:05:15,795 --> 02:05:17,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We should we should look at that.

1544
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:18,576
[SPEAKER_07]: What did we predict?

1545
02:05:18,576 --> 02:05:25,179
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're gonna find out because I should make our predictions next week, I guess since we're Yeah, I need preparation for that.

1546
02:05:25,179 --> 02:05:29,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can look at what our predictions are this year.

1547
02:05:29,001 --> 02:05:29,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1548
02:05:31,676 --> 02:05:33,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I have them on my desktop.

1549
02:05:33,357 --> 02:05:35,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did I put OLR 2020?

1550
02:05:35,138 --> 02:05:36,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here we are.

1551
02:05:36,879 --> 02:05:37,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I found him.

1552
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I found him.

1553
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:39,081
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

1554
02:05:39,081 --> 02:05:39,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's do it.

1555
02:05:39,801 --> 02:05:40,322
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1556
02:05:40,322 --> 02:05:40,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's recap.

1557
02:05:40,982 --> 02:05:41,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we are.

1558
02:05:41,282 --> 02:05:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I have them in my very fancy notepad file.

1559
02:05:44,044 --> 02:05:46,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, how can I make this bigger?

1560
02:05:46,565 --> 02:05:46,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1561
02:05:46,906 --> 02:05:47,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1562
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:47,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1563
02:05:47,686 --> 02:05:52,069
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna make this bigger.

1564
02:05:52,069 --> 02:05:59,454
[SPEAKER_07]: WordPad, I am using the most current technology I have available to me.

1565
02:06:00,638 --> 02:06:01,279
[SPEAKER_07]: on the internet.

1566
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:21,932
[SPEAKER_07]: because the next prediction was me, the PSVR 2 flops.

1567
02:06:21,932 --> 02:06:24,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to give myself a point for that.

1568
02:06:24,093 --> 02:06:24,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1569
02:06:24,473 --> 02:06:26,614
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have defined what a flop is.

1570
02:06:26,614 --> 02:06:28,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen them in stores.

1571
02:06:28,375 --> 02:06:28,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1572
02:06:28,855 --> 02:06:32,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, yeah, they may be available because no one's buying them, but like it's.

1573
02:06:33,297 --> 02:06:33,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1574
02:06:33,757 --> 02:06:34,498
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1575
02:06:34,498 --> 02:06:35,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1576
02:06:35,258 --> 02:06:37,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I think neither one of these are technically correct.

1577
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:41,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't like flop, but it didn't do gangbusters either.

1578
02:06:41,122 --> 02:06:43,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So I certainly forgot what what?

1579
02:06:43,724 --> 02:06:44,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

1580
02:06:44,945 --> 02:06:46,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1581
02:06:46,366 --> 02:06:51,749
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura had predicted the Google Chrome gamebook bombs.

1582
02:06:51,749 --> 02:06:59,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that's in a similar situation where I haven't heard of it bombing, but it isn't really doing gangbusters either.

1583
02:06:59,494 --> 02:07:01,836
[SPEAKER_06]: The Google like Google Chrome sales.

1584
02:07:03,576 --> 02:07:06,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Abk Microsoft merger will not go through and an example is made of them.

1585
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:27,992
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura said Kotick forced out of the working world completely.

1586
02:07:56,429 --> 02:07:58,532
[SPEAKER_07]: HalfPointe

1587
02:08:17,114 --> 02:08:22,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki says Nintendo finally announces new console for what they're cooking up next year.

1588
02:08:22,256 --> 02:08:23,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1589
02:08:23,437 --> 02:08:24,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Zonk, zonk.

1590
02:08:24,257 --> 02:08:25,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Try again.

1591
02:08:25,738 --> 02:08:27,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, I don't even remember this.

1592
02:08:27,999 --> 02:08:32,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki said cocaine bear game is insane and awesome.

1593
02:08:32,281 --> 02:08:33,042
[SPEAKER_06]: They never had one.

1594
02:08:34,787 --> 02:08:46,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they never came out with one, that's right, because this was in the movie, that's right, this was in the movie trailer, was everywhere, and Megan and all that shit, and you were like, oh, there's inevitably gonna be a Cocaine Bear game, womp womp, nope, there won't.

1595
02:08:46,282 --> 02:08:49,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, me, Valve releases a 3, boy did I get that one wrong.

1596
02:08:50,183 --> 02:08:51,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, I take that back.

1597
02:08:51,344 --> 02:08:55,146
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a Cocaine Bear game.

1598
02:08:55,146 --> 02:08:57,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it insane and awesome?

1599
02:08:57,187 --> 02:09:01,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a web game and it is not insane or awesome.

1600
02:09:01,909 --> 02:09:03,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Pac-Man.

1601
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:04,891
[SPEAKER_07]: We're keeping that red color.

1602
02:09:04,891 --> 02:09:08,033
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, DarkSakura literally can't even.

1603
02:09:08,033 --> 02:09:10,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's that was that she's just given.

1604
02:09:10,154 --> 02:09:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been able.

1605
02:09:11,014 --> 02:09:13,356
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just given herself a point.

1606
02:09:13,356 --> 02:09:17,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also predicted for Dead by Daylight, Candyman or Pumpkinhead.

1607
02:09:18,058 --> 02:09:19,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choices, but didn't happen.

1608
02:09:19,899 --> 02:09:21,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be let's be real.

1609
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:23,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised by Chucky.

1610
02:09:23,181 --> 02:09:26,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's be real.

1611
02:09:26,083 --> 02:09:28,145
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's a hard one to predict.

1612
02:09:28,145 --> 02:09:30,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Candyman was being predicted a lot of places.

1613
02:09:30,506 --> 02:09:33,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's nobody could have predicted Nicolas Cage.

1614
02:09:33,368 --> 02:09:34,609
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was really going to say.

1615
02:09:34,609 --> 02:09:37,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody would have predicted Nicolas Cage for sure.

1616
02:09:37,991 --> 02:09:41,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I put something up on my TikTok of me playing him with a Demogorgon.

1617
02:09:41,833 --> 02:09:42,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fun.

1618
02:09:42,633 --> 02:09:43,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny.

1619
02:09:43,193 --> 02:09:44,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

1620
02:09:44,074 --> 02:09:49,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So honestly, we really only kind of got points in this section here.

1621
02:09:49,576 --> 02:09:56,899
[SPEAKER_07]: An example was made of ABK, Mitsuda no longer at Square Enix, and Kotick forced out of the working world completely.

1622
02:09:56,899 --> 02:09:58,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.

1623
02:09:58,159 --> 02:09:59,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.

1624
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:00,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, not great.

1625
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,061
[SPEAKER_07]: What did the other podcasts get?

1626
02:10:05,356 --> 02:10:05,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookies.

1627
02:10:26,809 --> 02:10:27,089
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1628
02:10:27,089 --> 02:10:28,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, RekordWN.

1629
02:10:28,191 --> 02:10:29,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job, everyone.

1630
02:10:29,553 --> 02:10:33,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, so we'll do new predictions next week.

1631
02:10:33,097 --> 02:10:34,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God I had that file saved.

1632
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:35,380
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

1633
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:37,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe next year I'll make a PowerPoint.

1634
02:10:37,122 --> 02:10:38,104
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll really do something with it.

1635
02:10:39,284 --> 02:10:40,544
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1636
02:10:40,544 --> 02:10:41,545
[SPEAKER_02]: PowerPoint.

1637
02:10:41,545 --> 02:10:43,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all keynote.

1638
02:10:43,305 --> 02:10:44,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1639
02:10:44,366 --> 02:10:45,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1640
02:10:45,226 --> 02:10:47,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Or well, what's what's in reality?

1641
02:10:47,386 --> 02:10:50,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't actually use PowerPoint, to be clear.

1642
02:10:50,047 --> 02:10:52,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I use... Rob, real people use Tableau.

1643
02:10:52,888 --> 02:10:56,409
[SPEAKER_07]: What's what is Open Office's version?

1644
02:10:56,409 --> 02:10:57,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Impress.

1645
02:10:57,349 --> 02:10:58,630
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've used.

1646
02:10:58,630 --> 02:10:59,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Impress.

1647
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:01,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you not impressed?

1648
02:11:01,491 --> 02:11:07,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you know whenever there's information you need to present, you should just go for Tableau?

1649
02:11:07,072 --> 02:11:08,153
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'll just use Impress.

1650
02:11:10,259 --> 02:11:10,819
[SPEAKER_07]: OpenOffice

1651
02:11:35,277 --> 02:11:38,499
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you are playing Dead by Daylight tonight, right?

1652
02:11:59,938 --> 02:12:06,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cause it's Sunday night is always killer night unless people are like, play with me.

1653
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:14,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I'm not able to go as long as I was before because I actually do have work tomorrow.

1654
02:12:14,102 --> 02:12:19,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I need, I need to get some pigu time in, you know, we need some pigu time.

1655
02:12:19,583 --> 02:12:20,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Well have fun, have a good stream.

1656
02:12:20,804 --> 02:12:24,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a final thought for us before you head out?

1657
02:12:24,165 --> 02:12:29,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, fact check before you fucking post.

1658
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1659
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:31,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Good advice.

1660
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:32,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with video content.

1661
02:12:32,581 --> 02:12:34,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say that right now.

1662
02:12:34,782 --> 02:12:39,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the video content that you're posting isn't from a film that was made three years ago.

1663
02:12:39,623 --> 02:12:40,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1664
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:41,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, people.

1665
02:12:41,404 --> 02:12:42,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1666
02:12:42,264 --> 02:12:44,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too easy to hit that repost button.

1667
02:12:44,645 --> 02:12:45,425
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1668
02:12:45,425 --> 02:12:46,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Later, gators.

1669
02:12:46,165 --> 02:12:47,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1670
02:12:47,886 --> 02:12:51,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1671
02:12:51,687 --> 02:12:57,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully I'll have some new episode content out soon, since I have a lot of it edited already and I probably should just get it done.

1672
02:12:58,857 --> 02:12:59,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll do that.

1673
02:12:59,865 --> 02:13:00,429
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get it done.

1674
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:02,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

1675
02:13:02,351 --> 02:13:06,294
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I'll be having another new character day with Shane at some point this week.

1676
02:13:06,294 --> 02:13:08,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I've been posting TikToks.

1677
02:13:08,215 --> 02:13:09,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done like three.

1678
02:13:09,076 --> 02:13:10,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a TikToker now.

1679
02:13:10,096 --> 02:13:12,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I've I did like three TikToks the first week of January.

1680
02:13:12,778 --> 02:13:13,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1681
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:15,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are I think they're fun little stories.

1682
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:16,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm test.

1683
02:13:16,441 --> 02:13:22,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually I kind of thought TikTok would be a fun space to kind of test material for things that I might use on stage later on.

1684
02:13:22,485 --> 02:13:27,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to get some insight into storytelling and things like that, check out TikTok.

1685
02:13:27,369 --> 02:13:30,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I am Mr. Mr. Rob Roberts on TikTok because somebody took my name.

1686
02:13:31,091 --> 02:13:32,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitch, and YouTube

1687
02:13:56,551 --> 02:13:57,411
[SPEAKER_07]: There's that.

1688
02:13:57,411 --> 02:13:58,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make websites now.

1689
02:13:58,592 --> 02:14:00,292
[SPEAKER_07]: What year is this?

1690
02:14:00,292 --> 02:14:00,392
[SPEAKER_07]: 90s?

1691
02:14:00,392 --> 02:14:01,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Mobile friendly sites, too.

1692
02:14:01,633 --> 02:14:05,794
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to do that version that, you know, does mobile land, but it's what it is.

1693
02:14:05,794 --> 02:14:08,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a link tree for now, and that does that does good enough.

1694
02:14:08,355 --> 02:14:11,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, especially because I'm trying to do it without Twitter.

1695
02:14:11,717 --> 02:14:19,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you all know, but like I literally locked my Twitter and there's a my bio now says I don't post here, basically.

1696
02:14:19,179 --> 02:14:22,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So it says something equivalent of I don't post here.

1697
02:14:22,921 --> 02:14:23,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Blue Sky.

1698
02:14:24,401 --> 02:14:41,298
[SPEAKER_07]: um so that and that's you know there's still a lot of people on twitter that won't fucking leave which i understand it's it's comfortable and so forth and there's still a lot of engagement to be had there but i am playing hard mode by being stubborn and not doing fucking twitter so there's that

1699
02:14:42,375 --> 02:14:48,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, Bobby Blackwell says you need websites now so you're not reliant on any social media platform.

1700
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:50,762
[SPEAKER_07]: HotPocketry asks, is BlueSky open?

1701
02:14:50,762 --> 02:14:51,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes and no.

1702
02:14:51,623 --> 02:14:57,968
[SPEAKER_07]: You still need an invite code, which if you need an invite code, like talk to a lot of people in chat can hook you up.

1703
02:14:57,968 --> 02:15:02,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Or message me on Discord, we'll get you hooked up.

1704
02:15:02,311 --> 02:15:10,118
[SPEAKER_07]: But what they did open up is that now you can actually link to posts and you can see them without having a BlueSky account.

1705
02:15:10,618 --> 02:15:11,679
[SPEAKER_07]: which is huge.

1706
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:15,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically like your blue skies are now all public.

1707
02:15:15,622 --> 02:15:17,203
[SPEAKER_07]: But they gave the user base warning.

1708
02:15:17,203 --> 02:15:20,846
[SPEAKER_07]: They said in 30 days, your posts will be viewable publicly.

1709
02:15:20,846 --> 02:15:27,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have anything you don't want, you, you know, but, but they keep reminding blue sky has always been an open platform.

1710
02:15:27,832 --> 02:15:28,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to be careful.

1711
02:15:28,673 --> 02:15:34,918
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're, they're trying to remind people, but that has not stopped FCF from happening every Friday.

1712
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:38,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, apparently FCF broke blue sky this last Friday.

1713
02:15:39,522 --> 02:15:47,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And FCF does not mean Fuzzy Cat Friday, it means something else, and I will leave it to your active imaginations to figure out.

1714
02:15:48,775 --> 02:15:51,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Fat Chicken Friday, but it's close.

1715
02:15:51,596 --> 02:15:54,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll leave it at that.

1716
02:15:54,558 --> 02:15:56,599
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, Blue Sky is fun.

1717
02:15:56,599 --> 02:15:57,779
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I post now.

1718
02:15:57,779 --> 02:16:04,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to see my daily things on short form media, Blue Sky is the place to be.

1719
02:16:04,322 --> 02:16:08,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Instagram, I still use Instagram, at Mr. Rob Roberts, same name there.

1720
02:16:08,044 --> 02:16:09,805
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find all my stuff on Linktree at Rob Roberts.

1721
02:16:10,245 --> 02:16:34,087
[SPEAKER_07]: all right um but that's it we're out of here have a wonderful night everybody we will see you next week here on the show uh you're getting the holiday outro tonight one more time because i forgot to sub it out but are we still within the 12 days of christmas i think today i think today is literally the last day or it was yesterday i don't know whatever lazy reason i have you still get the holiday outro one more time happy new year everybody good night

1722

[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:42,723 --> 02:16:47,786
