10424	15527	The unsung hero of modern music gaming, Groove Coaster, joins the arcade score tracking graveyard.
15527	21691	The game isn't going away yet, but your play history, save customizations, items, and online multiplayer will starting in April.
21691	24973	It takes a shutdown to make that game's unlock system less awful.
24973	26614	Funny how that works.
26614	28535	This is just one of tonight's Music Game Updates.
28535	34659	Now it's time for your hosts, Rubber Upperts Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this, the other Music Game Update, and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34659	36881	Starting right now on the show, wherever your gamer has a voice,
39710	42173	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
42173	47120	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47120	55591	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 990 of our program for tonight.
55991	59413	January the 21st of 2024.
59413	68339	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week to talk about what is going on in video games and gaming culture with all of you live in chat and all of the world through our podcast feed.
68339	70780	But of course, I could not do it without my co hosts.
70780	74863	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74863	75363	Hello.
75363	76684	Hi.
76684	77044	How are you?
78977	90843	I had my COVID shot, which everyone needs to make sure that they have their COVID vaccine unless they have allergies or a medically prescribed reason why they cannot.
90843	96565	But I also have other underlying conditions that means it kicked my ass.
96565	97906	It kicked my ass a lot.
98546	101627	In fact, it's hitting you so hard, it's screwing up your video as well.
101627	105048	But that's, hey, what else?
105048	105748	Right on my side.
105748	106228	Hold on.
106228	106608	It's fine.
106608	108088	This is an episode of OLR.
108088	110729	If there is at least a little bit of tech fail, what can you do?
110729	113209	So all right, there we go there.
113209	116170	There's there's our little VTuber in the Super Metroid.
116170	118511	The last VTuber is in captivity.
118511	119591	The galaxy is at peace.
121158	123179	I just turn it off and on again.
123179	125440	Oh, that's a great way to fix IT problems.
125440	126541	Let me tell you.
126541	127382	All right.
127382	132184	That's what I 90% of the time have to tell people to do every freaking day.
132184	133445	All right.
133445	136307	We'll be coming back to you in just a moment for our kickoff topic tonight.
136307	144752	But I'm sure folks that are watching us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv.
145772	149214	Slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
149214	151596	Folks that are watching live are probably going, hey, wait a minute.
151596	152937	Loki looks a little different this week.
152937	153817	What's going on over there?
153817	154318	Oh, my God.
154318	155599	Loki's a shapeshifter.
155599	156399	Yes.
156399	157220	So here's the thing.
157220	159842	Here's our special guest Mystique.
159842	162383	Loki has a kid.
162383	163804	One of the kiddos has a birthday today.
163804	165886	So, of course, family is priority for him.
165886	167146	You can't blame him at all.
167146	168687	So he's off doing stuff with the kids.
168687	170028	I don't know where they want to get taken today.
170028	172910	So we decided to invite a guest host on.
172910	175452	And this guest host is going to be completely familiar to all of you.
175852	178393	because he's called into the show many times.
178393	183916	He hosts his own podcast here at The Voice Geeks Network with some of his friends called Anime Jam Session.
183916	187938	It is, of course, the one and only DJ Ranma S. Hey, Ranma.
187938	188719	Hey, what's up, Rob?
188719	189439	How are you?
189439	190620	I am doing fantastic.
190620	193481	Thanks for agreeing to be here.
193481	194301	Thanks for doing this.
194301	196382	Appreciate you.
196382	196883	Of course.
196883	200505	I just want you to know when I got that text, I almost dropped my phone out of my hand.
200505	201305	I was like, wait, what?
202185	204327	No.
204327	207750	Well, let's let's be clear, Loki can never be replaced.
207750	211394	But yeah, it's not often we get a lot of notice.
211394	213756	Usually if a host isn't here, it's because somebody's sick.
213756	215898	So usually we'll just kind of make it a two person show.
215898	216899	It is what it is.
216899	218480	But we had enough notice this week.
218480	222584	And I was like, Wait a minute, Rama wanted to talk about a recent trip that he took.
223184	242545	and some of the picture well you know we'll get into that a little bit because you took went on a really big trip and you have some insights to gaming culture and some things as a result of this so it is still a video game thing but we're gonna talk about that in a minute and I was like why doesn't he just freaking come on for the show we have a chair open let's do it so here we are we're in this virtual thing now you don't have to come to my house to be on the show
242605	245686	Okay, Anime Jam Session, as I like to call it, is a 90 minute show where you have me,
271852	279316	Mako-chan and Ari will re-talk about some of the topics and information of what's going on in the anime industry, whether it's in the U.S.
279316	298786	or Japan, find out what's going on with upcoming conventions and the culture, and we kind of take our little spin on it, and usually we have one doing color commentary, one going on outlandish, and then there's the straight guy, me, like, we kind of need to calm this together, until I get an article and I'm just like, what is this?
299554	310742	So, it's just basically us discussing what's going on, and just trying to give our spin, our thoughts on it, from going to conventions over the last, I'd say, several years.
310742	312603	You go to a lot of conventions.
312603	319928	Like, if you're not listening to Anime Jams, you don't understand how many conventions that show covers, because you're very well-traveled on the East Coast.
319928	322530	I mean, sometimes the West Coast, mostly the East Coast, you know.
323898	325840	I use somewhere on my computer.
325840	328942	There is a Excel spreadsheet by year.
328942	332645	Every single convention that I've attended since I started.
332645	333366	That's smart.
333366	334547	I wish I'd done something like that.
334547	335628	I have to go back and think now.
336598	340200	about five, I think about five, six years ago, I hit like the 150 mark.
340200	342501	And I'm just like, Oh, wow.
342501	343382	That's impressive.
343382	344302	Well, that's awesome.
344302	345903	Well, um, make no mistake.
345903	347884	Everybody Rama's playing the role of the host tonight.
347884	350165	He's going to help us with stories and all of that stuff.
350165	356809	So we'll get to that in a little bit, but we want to get to our kickoff topic tonight because boy, oh boy, it's so funny.
356809	359611	Last week we did the predictions episode.
359611	365114	I don't think anybody could have predicted this game comes out of fricking nowhere and has just
366397	368459	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
389980	407171	Here's the thing, it's a little bit more like some of those survival games, but the big battle system with your little creatures is pretty obvious.
407171	409592	It's like Pokemon Dark.
409592	411514	There's no turn-based battle system.
412094	435430	which is kind of but I mean I'm not like I get where the issues are because it's it's the look that's that's causing a lot of the controversy but I do think it's important to say it's a survival game first and instead of like let's say Lego Lego Fortnite and chickens instead of the chickens it's these may or may not be skirting the line of legally different from Pokemon
436471	445784	I refuse to support it since they use AI for their character designs, and I also will not support plagiarism.
452268	470594	So it's allegedly, but there's plenty of discussion from PocketPear's CEO going back to 2022 where he talks about generative AI tools being sophisticated enough to avoid copyright issues.
470594	478657	And there's another one in 2021 where they were showing how AI could be used to generate new Pokemon designs.
482599	499670	But there's way too much evidence, and especially in the teams that were created for the creation of this game, very inexperienced designers.
504062	511342	Many people who were amateurs in their fields who are bringing in on this professional product and
515777	530311	including the fact that, I mean, now I'm not going to be disparaging on this one because they're saying that they had a graduate student who did a hundred of the character concepts.
530311	535777	You know, she applied to all these companies and failed, but now she's apparently drawing the characters.
539321	542143	I mean, a talented artist could do all that.
542143	545246	That's absolutely, absolutely fine.
545246	554933	But if if she's also bringing in AI to do this work, she'd have to do it with company's knowledge.
554933	566922	And this is more than just like I was looking at the designs, this is more than just a passing similarity, like, you know, an art style tribute.
569779	572120	And Questbuster got to my next point.
572120	573100	Please don't jump the gun.
573100	573681	Thank you.
573681	576401	Well, remember the podcasters can't read chat.
576401	578202	I know.
578202	585004	But they are also they had another game on Steam called AI Art Imposter.
585004	585044	So
591064	604309	I think that AI has a big part to do with these designs and the fact that it is, like I said, it's more than a passing resemblance to Pokemon.
604309	609332	There are way too many similarities for it to be coincidence.
609332	612453	But yeah.
612453	620116	I think that they took Pokemon as a concept and then stole another concept from another game and made their own game.
622555	624918	So, I have some complex thoughts on this.
624918	626239	Very complex thoughts.
626239	630043	And I'm gonna say up front- I'm not capable of complexity tonight.
630043	631985	If it's obvious.
631985	633266	Go ahead, Ranma.
633266	636089	Well, I can say, I have played the game.
636089	639853	I put at least about an hour into the game.
639853	642275	I heard about this through normal means.
642275	645258	I heard someone, it was basically like, Pokemon with guns.
645258	645639	I'm just like,
647059	648319	go on.
648319	652400	So, I go and I download it, and I start playing this game.
652400	661922	And I can tell already, I'm not gonna be really big into it, because I'm not really into the type of games where you have to build and construct everything in order to survive.
661922	665783	I've only played a couple of those games, and I'm not really good at them.
665783	673285	I thought it would be more like Borderlands 3, where you get dropped right in, here's your weapon, here's your equipment, go, go, go, go.
673285	674645	Shoot, hunt, this, all of that.
675445	690767	While I was at the laundromat today someone made a mention about AI being connected to this game and then I went digging on Twitter and seeing the similarities and the accusations at that point I just uninstalled the game because the field that I'm in
691838	696583	AI can kinda mess with my job, my livelihood.
696583	705792	I mean, granted, I'm way far up the ladder, but still, it's a chain effect if AI gets more and more into what I do.
708254	728046	I've also spent a few hours with the game and I kind of got turned on to it because of well the fact that it's on Game Pass and you know then everybody it was kind of the same thing I heard like what it's like a 4k Pokemon what is going on and people are going nuts about it all right let me install this and figure out what's going on and I had that's kind of the same takeaway as my first thought I was like this isn't Pokemon
728206	739133	This is a survival game that's using the Pokémon kind of shtick as sort of a mechanic within the game, and specifically Pokémon Legends, which I think is important to say.
739133	744297	Because again, there's no turn-based battles in the game, and even, you know, which is the core element of a Pokémon game.
744297	748020	So, but, but, I mean, here's, here's the thing at the end of the day.
748860	752182	I think there's two different issues going here.
752182	754904	And there's two very different issues going on with this game.
754904	757106	And there are two, I feel two different ways about them.
757106	759467	And that's why I say my feelings are complex.
759467	767853	One of the issues is this talk about AI, and what the CEO has said about AI in the past, and the track record of what else the company has released, and some of these other things.
768713	771134	I'm that's actually not enough evidence for me.
771134	778757	And I'm gonna I'm gonna explain why because we just had a talk on this show a couple weeks ago about Square Enix.
778757	787661	And there was an article about Square Enix and the CEO actually went out and said, we're going to be aggressive with using AI for development.
788061	791562	We're going to use AI to develop these games and do these things.
791562	795924	And, you know, obviously now we have these issues with FoamStars, which we'll talk about later and so forth.
795924	805287	I think what it really boils down to is the issue with AI is that most of us get pissed off when we see AI art ripped off.
805287	806787	And that's the part that pisses us off.
806787	809228	If you're using AI for map generation,
809668	819661	for enemy stuff for automating textures in your game to help turn around HD graphics that's been trained on your own process and your own thing.
819661	825068	I think generally, the public doesn't have an issue with that it's AI art that they have a problem with.
826215	828278	which leads to the second issue.
828278	834045	So with AI, again, also, one of the things I want to say on that with AI is that Steam has a policy.
834045	836428	That's another thing that we've talked about in the past couple weeks.
836428	843797	Steam came out with a policy and said, our publishers, if they want to be on the store, they have to disclose that they're using AI in their game.
844398	849325	And here's a report button to report if you suspect that that's a thing that's being used.
849325	856555	This is right now, like one of the most ever, like it's up there with Baldur's Gate 3, with how freaking popular it is on Steam right now.
856555	861521	And from the discourse trademark I've seen online, I'm sure people have been reporting it.
862562	871584	Now, the company, I guess, could lie, but that's an awfully big bet for them to take, is that they're not going to get caught.
871584	878306	So, the evidence saying that this game is using AI, not good enough for me.
878306	885608	And what's being used as evidence right now, then why aren't we all canceling our Final Fantasy Rebirth pre-orders?
885848	889812	because Square Enix is going the same way.
889812	896739	I hope nobody bought that Prince of Persia game from Ubisoft because Ubisoft CEO CEOs tend to be tone deaf.
896739	899522	But at the end of the day, it's going to be the sales that drive those games.
899522	901364	But now I want to talk about the second issue.
901364	902325	And the second issue is
903325	904105	Plagiarism
924338	932641	Look, if I'm at Nintendo or I'm at the Pokemon Company, I've probably got the legal team drafting up a cease and desist that's going to hit on Monday or Tuesday.
932641	944645	And that is going to be very fascinating, because I think we're on a direct collision course for some type of, you know, Street Fighter versus Fighters history type of thing going on here with this, which is a very classic
946266	947307	Capcom Lost Digimon Storylines
969093	983459	Well, and what's interesting too, is that there's also this whole thing with the rockstar suing remedy games because the logo is, and it's like, they don't look anything alike, but some companies are much more litigious and in protecting their IP than others.
983459	996005	And I think the other thing with Pokemon specifically is that I'm pretty sure most of the major Pokemon, maybe not all 1000, but I could be wrong, but most of them, especially the ones that they're going to turn into plushies and toys, they get trademarked.
996505	1017978	And I think that's the thing that's going to be a little unique about this is that if they can prove in court that these are Pokemon assets that were lifted and pallet changed or like swiped around, you know, these types of things, that's going to be very interesting because I think they've got something with their assets that not all game companies have.
1017978	1020040	And that's the trademarks for this other stuff.
1020820	1029583	But there's also, um, I believe there's the 50% change rule to where something becomes free use or fair use.
1029583	1037886	But one thing, though, about the 50% rule, that rule might just be here in the U.S., but it might not apply in Japan because, you know, trade and coverage laws are different there.
1037886	1042167	Yeah, but they're still selling the game in the U.S., so it still has to be.
1042167	1043167	Yeah.
1043167	1043547	So.
1043547	1044148	All right.
1044148	1044968	You got that one.
1045448	1047589	Um, and I am looking at chat as well.
1047589	1052712	Sorry, I just want to point out Mike def says I do think that pal world is going to be the flavor of the month game.
1052712	1056394	Nobody the concurrent player base is going to drop really hard come in February.
1056394	1061077	And I actually I actually kind of agree because here's here's something very important to keep in mind.
1061077	1063038	There's Pokemon fans out there.
1063038	1064019	I made the mistake.
1064719	1086873	of going in and looking at the discourse trademark on this last night because I find this whole thing actually super fascinating because at the end of the day, usually when you have games that are that hard cloned, and I want to point out, you've got elements of arc in here, you've got like the font is like straight out of Breath of the Wild and a lot of like the art direction when it comes to the structures and the way the world is built is very Breath of the Wild inspired.
1086873	1089335	You've got obviously the Pokemon element so forth.
1089335	1090576	It's borrowing heavily
1090856	1118808	for many games out there and usually games that are clones like that they fucking suck like we just we go oh it's a mobile knockoff game garbage throw it in the bin right the neat interesting thing about this game that's I think put is like the sum of all the parts is actually kind of not bad especially considering the game is still early access that's that's the wild thing about this game the wild thing about this is that it has no right
1119727	1126873	to be as smooth as it is when you consider what all may or may not be going into it.
1126873	1129735	But I agree that with the thing that's a flash in the pan game.
1129735	1130596	And I'm going to tell you why.
1130596	1135180	Because Pokemon fans are getting their feathers extremely ruffled at this game.
1135180	1141986	It's not a again, there is no, there's no turn-based combat in the game, the core feature of Pokemon.
1143215	1147240	I don't think this will be a flash in a pan game per se.
1147240	1153026	If it does, it's going to be around for a little while longer because from people I've seen playing this game,
1153939	1166152	The majority of- not the majority, but a lot of people playing POW World just to spite Pokemon and Game Freak because these are fans of Pokemon who are tired of Game Freak's actions when it comes to the games and so on.
1166152	1176242	They're just doing it out of pure spite, which if you ask me is why there were so many concurrent players on their servers to do this, okay?
1176522	1186227	Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, you can't ignore that there is at least 3 million people out there that are saying loud and clear, Nintendo needs to step it up when it comes to tech.
1186227	1204337	Is it like the fact that, you know, Pokemon in 4k, even though I don't think that's what this game is at all, the fact that that is the perception out there in gaming culture that has absolutely led to why all of these people are suddenly downloading this game and the success and all that and that, oh, it's online multiplayer, it's smooth, it looks really good and all this stuff.
1204337	1204978	Yeah.
1204978	1205098	Now,
1205738	1207940	I want to be also fair to the Pokemon Company.
1207940	1217446	You know, I know Gen 9 gets a lot of crap, but I still believe in my heart of hearts that that game was set up a little bit because I believe they optimized it for a Switch system that never came out.
1217446	1218767	I will take that to my grave.
1218767	1228914	I firmly believe that OLED Switch that we got was supposed to be something much different, and because of the pandemic, they scaled it way back, and the Pokemon games technically suffered for it.
1229614	1235098	But it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with the next switch now.
1235098	1236599	But here's the other thing.
1236599	1241242	I really don't think Pokemon or whatever has anything to worry about, because here's the thing.
1241242	1247786	Pokemon's got a lot of soul and a lot of charm because they have the voice acted, you know, Pokemon that make the cute.
1247786	1248747	They got the anime.
1248747	1250007	They got the plushies.
1250007	1250628	They got the world.
1250628	1253069	They got that whole they've got the trainer.
1253069	1254110	I'm going to be the very best.
1254110	1255171	I want to go get them all.
1255171	1258173	And people, you know, and here's the thing, like I'm going to be honest.
1258513	1264724	This isn't completely a dig on PAL world because again, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.
1264724	1268711	But at the end of the day, I found, I find PAL world to be very soulless.
1270313	1271054	In Contrast
1290808	1292288	at the end of the day.
1292288	1298970	And that's something very important to Pokemon that PowerWorld is not bringing to the table.
1298970	1302030	Now PowerWorld may be successful for other reasons.
1302030	1306631	But again, I don't think Pokemon fans have a goddamn thing to worry about.
1306631	1316853	Now as far as Nintendo and that that whole mess, I do feel the game that I've played this weekend, I will not be playing in its same form in six months.
1316853	1317533	Let's just say that.
1319341	1321003	I'm kind of hoping for that.
1321003	1325928	And from what I've seen, there are people who have already set up private servers to play together.
1325928	1331134	So if this gets to CND, there's going to be underground power fight clubs going on.
1333638	1334499	Maybe.
1334499	1336822	Maybe, yeah.
1336822	1344612	I think the most interesting thing about this game is it's causing us to face all of these issues in the industry, like, head on.
1344612	1346133	Like, all at once.
1346133	1347295	It's the AI.
1347295	1348456	It's the clone thing.
1348456	1349137	Because, I mean,
1350242	1356304	If we want to talk about asset grabs and putting them in a game, I find it very interesting.
1356304	1367368	I think maybe out of all the short blogs I read last night, I saw one out of many that mentioned vampire survivors.
1367368	1370809	Now, why do I bring that game up?
1370809	1377751	Because that game obviously lifted a lot from something else, but because it was so different
1378632	1379733	I think people didn't notice.
1379733	1386481	Or perhaps they were sick and fucking tired of the company that owned those assets, which is certainly possible.
1386481	1387382	Nobody really brought that up.
1388220	1392984	You know, and then of course there isn't the, and I'm going to say that the comments that the CEO made, they're not great.
1392984	1396667	I'm not going to defend them, but I think a lot of CEOs are making ridiculous comments.
1396667	1404453	And that whole thing, what I feel like happened is that, okay, they went away from AI and they hired people because they talk about the person that came in to do this.
1404453	1404753	Yay.
1404753	1405294	That's good.
1405294	1414841	But it sounds like to turn around the amount of monsters they were looking for in a short amount of time, allegedly there may have been some shortcuts, not such a good look.
1414841	1416002	So, um,
1416963	1418363	It's going to be interesting.
1418363	1422344	I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1422344	1425345	Fifth Dream says this doesn't feel cheap or cobbled together.
1425345	1434308	Yeah, like again, for a game that borrows heavily from a lot of influences, it doesn't feel cheap, especially again for a game that's early access.
1435948	1438590	Questbuster says PAL world definitely has a lot of jank right now.
1438590	1441832	Could mods change that or will the developer actually stick with it?
1441832	1442332	Who knows?
1442332	1443733	It's too early to tell right now.
1443733	1444454	Yeah.
1444454	1453099	And the fact is, this game ain't going anywhere, unless we see something happen from Nintendo or the Pokemon company and their legal team.
1453099	1454941	And even then, that doesn't mean the game goes away right away.
1456021	1461843	I think there's I think there's about to be a very interesting legal discussion happening here.
1461843	1469805	And this is going to be something that really guides our 2024 in gaming because something else to consider.
1469805	1476967	Ironically, everybody else is going to be looking at the runaway success of POW World.
1476967	1480168	And now there's going to be clones of the clone.
1480168	1483609	Send in the clones!
1483609	1484689	That's what's about to happen.
1486490	1489759	Well, I mean, Sony did that a long time ago.
1489759	1491224	PlayStation All-Stars.
1491224	1493430	Yeah, that was a really great idea.
1495252	1499273	I mean, clones of games have always been a thing in this industry.
1499273	1499713	Always.
1499713	1501294	I mean, Minecraft.
1501294	1501874	Hello.
1501874	1502574	How many Minecraft?
1502574	1507395	I mean, essentially, it's kind of, if you think about where this is, it's kind of a Minecraft clone.
1507395	1510956	Doom, when that came out, then first person shooters were all the rage.
1510956	1515817	Street Fighter 2, probably the most cloned game of all time.
1515817	1517458	Or fucking Flappy Bird.
1517458	1522359	Anything that gets traction usually ends up getting cloned in one way or another.
1522359	1522699	So it's,
1523902	1526783	Pokemon is known to and there's other Pokemon clone games out there.
1526783	1534527	It's just this one has now gotten the AI label on it, which is, let's be real, it's the 2024 NFT sticker is now on this game.
1534527	1544371	And that's got a lot of people, you know, but again, I, you know, for power worlds credit, I'm not convinced on the AI front, you feeling like it has AI isn't enough.
1545091	1553035	because every CEO is talking about AI and some of them, like I pointed out with Square Enix, some more than others.
1553035	1561479	And, you know, again, if they're lying about AI to Steam, that is going to be very, that's a very risky business decision.
1561479	1561819	That's it.
1562938	1563338	a great
1583194	1585078	I'm a step back from this.
1585078	1589206	I have about 200 other video games that need some love and attention.
1589206	1593656	I'm gonna go show them some love till Verdi comes back on that.
1594867	1596468	It's going to be an interesting 2024.
1596468	1601151	And this is a very interesting way to start it off.
1601151	1604814	And nobody could have predicted this seven days ago.
1604814	1607416	I really like all of this came out of nowhere.
1607416	1611098	So it's, it's gonna be very interesting.
1611098	1611919	Let's see.
1611919	1616202	Tigerclaw says 2024 is the year that AI be the talk of the town, good or bad.
1616202	1619264	You know, what's interesting is I was having a chat with a friend on this.
1619264	1620145	And this, this is true.
1621323	1623825	AI is not leaving, period.
1623825	1626346	So we have to figure this out.
1626346	1637813	We kind of need, what we need to happen is we need our government to regulate the use of AI art and who ultimately owns AI art and most importantly, how AI art can be trained.
1637813	1643197	The government needs, they're never going to do a goddamn, our government is incapable of passing a fucking budget.
1643197	1644898	They're not going to, they're never going to get to this.
1645558	1652200	So it's it's going to be the Wild West in some ways or it's it's going to be court cases one one after the other.
1652200	1656602	Fifth Dream in chat says we also need to differentiate AI art and AI.
1656602	1664925	Yes, I mean, that's important, too, because AI and game mechanics, you know, AI and game mechanics has been around since the fucking Atari 2600 or even since before that.
1664925	1665505	It's it's, you know,
1666065	1667006	It's AI art.
1667006	1669947	That's, that's the controversial thing.
1669947	1673668	And it's AI art getting trained off of shit that isn't yours.
1673668	1677110	That's the very controversial thing out there.
1677110	1680071	So that's, that's what this industry has got to figure out.
1680071	1691916	But again, when it now, you know, on the other hand, we have Foam Stars, I don't think we have a separate story on that tonight, but we have Foam Stars comes out and says, Oh, yeah, we used mid journey to put AI art as album covers in the game.
1691916	1692917	And now, now,
1693817	1696659	Now the stank is on that game.
1696659	1700201	The pit the little you remember pig pen from the peanuts.
1700201	1710588	That's now what but which is ironic because foam stars game about soap, but but I irony in gaming industry is fucking funny.
1710588	1714130	Now the cloud of stank is on that foam stars game.
1714130	1718193	And people are kind of trying to shift the cloud of stank to this game too.
1718193	1721055	And I understand it, but it's a different stank for me.
1721914	1723375	So, we'll see.
1723375	1729018	Rob, let me tell you, to go back to AI art, let's talk AI voice for a second.
1729018	1741484	A friend of mine, well-known voice actress, found out that somebody ripped her voice from a couple of video games for this person's podcast.
1741484	1748047	He did a Pokemon-themed podcast where he ripped voices and had them do scripts and so forth.
1749456	1764246	She and a couple other voice actors and actresses actually had to, they found him, sent emails, fans went after this person for ripping the voices, and he eventually apologized and took them all down.
1764246	1765247	And the thing is,
1766257	1767678	shouldn't have done it in the first place.
1767678	1768058	Right.
1768058	1768539	Exactly.
1768539	1770660	The thing is, I'll stick with that impersonations.
1770660	1773242	Thanks.
1773242	1785291	She contacted a friend of mine who works for Pokemon, but because of the laws of it wasn't too much they could really do short of like maybe copyright or trademark.
1785291	1788653	But right now there is no copyright or trademark on voices.
1789736	1792958	And you know what, I would still loop voice acting in with art.
1792958	1794099	Voice acting is art.
1794099	1795400	It's, it's performance art.
1795400	1800884	And so I still kind of loop it in that same category that that's, that's the shit we really need to figure out.
1800884	1804107	And that's the stuff that needs to be regulated, how we use it in games.
1804107	1811332	And to Steam's credit, they're telling companies they need to disclose in their releases, how they're gonna, how they're going to prove it.
1811332	1817157	That's, that's to be seen because you know what, it might come out that yeah, this game fucking lied to Steam about AI.
1817157	1818618	And that's going to be a whole
1819358	1833921	other interesting fucking episode when that goes down let me tell you it's it's going to be an interesting year and I yeah it's going to be a very interesting year this game is is kicking us off that's for sure so um
1835393	1836413	Let's see.
1836413	1839114	Um, yeah, but yeah, the voice acting not cool.
1839114	1840494	Don't do that to voice actors.
1840494	1843214	Just if you must stick with bad impersonations.
1843214	1852236	But if you have the voice actors permission, such as James Earl Jones gave permission to Disney to continue.
1852236	1853596	That's permission.
1853596	1856077	Okay, that's different.
1856077	1858377	But stop doing this without permission.
1858377	1860738	And I would never do that shit on this podcast.
1860738	1861598	And I think
1862777	1866581	I hope it was one of those things where they meant well, but boy, that was a mistake.
1866581	1868823	And they learned a real tough lesson on that.
1868823	1870525	So anyway, yep.
1870525	1871246	Yeah.
1871246	1872167	All right.
1872167	1874609	Let's move on on something a little more lighthearted.
1874609	1878973	I want to talk about this because Rama, you went on a really big trip recently.
1878973	1881176	And I know you were really excited about this.
1881176	1885560	So tell me a little bit about where you went and what you did.
1886618	1895506	Well, for those of you who didn't know, I spent two weeks in Japan and I had an amazing time.
1895506	1906656	I went because I had the opportunity and also the fact that my job is closed for the last two weeks of the year, so I'm like, wait, you mean to tell me we're closed for the last weeks of the year and it's two weeks vacation?
1907418	1909779	I'm gonna go to Japan, and I made it work.
1909779	1919284	So, to summarize, I was in Akihabara, I went to Hakone, Takayama, Osaka, Kyoto, Minato, I had a great time.
1919284	1929829	I was deep into anime, I checked out some video games, I hit some of the arcades, and I just had a really good time.
1929829	1936672	Rob, I sent you the link through Discord if you wanna show off some of the photos I took, and it's kinda fun.
1937182	1942466	Yeah, I will, but just remember for the podcast feed, we want to make sure we are describing a lot more here.
1942466	1947249	I want to go through everything, but I noticed you have some trips to the Nintendo stores, so we'll start there.
1947249	1948230	So I'm going to pull those up here.
1950165	1959351	But yeah, tell us a little bit about like, you know, you mentioned like kind of like how you saw gaming culture was maybe a little different there in Japan.
1959351	1960992	Talk to me a little more about that.
1960992	1965796	It's a better preservation of products and devices.
1965796	1968678	And so there's a more of a love for it.
1968678	1972120	Like let's talk modern, like the Nintendo store.
1972120	1976003	This is photos from Nintendo store.
1976003	1977343	I believe Kyoto.
1977343	1977604	Yes.
1977604	1978484	And I was there.
1979685	1990189	It's up on the sixth floor in a shopping mall, and I saw... There are products there that I saw that you cannot get at Nintendo Store New York.
1990189	2003273	The size of the store is basically twice the size of... Like, 1.5 the size of the entire store itself, but no Pokemon, so that's in a separate section.
2005302	2010646	And as I was walking around, you could see all of the consoles, you could see all of the merch.
2010646	2013929	There's a bigger display of the items.
2013929	2018853	And it's just... It's just amazing.
2018853	2026098	I was in pure awe of what I saw, because I'm like, I've never seen anything like this before.
2026098	2029581	I'm like, why don't we not have any of this stuff here, you know?
2031716	2042526	My partner is big into Splatoon, and I'm seeing all the Splatoon jackets, lifesavers, you... We're looking at a picture now with a ton of plushies.
2042526	2045749	It's just, like, travel bags.
2045749	2051314	I'm just like, this... If we had some of this stuff, it would sell like hotcakes.
2051314	2051794	It's just...
2052955	2052975	I
2075700	2082003	Tell me a little bit about you took a adventure as like one of your side trips, you went to the Square Enix cafe.
2082003	2083684	And of course, I find this very interesting.
2083684	2084685	Talk to me a little bit about that.
2085430	2087371	Alright, so check this out.
2087371	2090953	I stayed at a hotel called REM Akihabara.
2090953	2095115	It's literally right there in the heart of Akihabara.
2095115	2100257	I walk down the street and I look to my left and I'm just like, wait, what is this?
2100257	2102798	It's the Square Enix Cafe.
2102798	2111302	Me and a friend, we went inside and I was just like, this is amazing.
2111302	2114604	I don't have that many photos of the inside of the cafe because
2115304	2121486	I didn't want to be that tourist stopping every five feet taking pictures of almost every little thing.
2121486	2133351	But inside the cafe itself, there's like little sections devoted to different Final Fantasy games, Kingdom Hearts, and Dragon Quest, and it's just cool merch that you can pick up.
2134671	2140955	For a friend of mine, thankfully she's not listening, I picked up two Final Fantasy VII acrylic stands.
2140955	2150942	One is Tifa and one is Aerith, and no, she is not holding the, um, the chair.
2150942	2157266	Um, did you travel out to like any arcades and what was kind of like the arcade culture like?
2157266	2159047	Arcade culture was fun.
2159047	2162389	When I was in Kyoto, I went to round one.
2163926	2188386	and I was just kind of at first I kind of felt kind of nervous a little intimidated walking in trying to see what was going on so I walked around and I explored and the first thing I saw was a poppin music machine and I was like okay I'm going to play this and I'm just like wait what if my round one card doesn't work here and I look
2189628	2191189	It takes 100 yen coins.
2191189	2193830	So I'm like, I have a pocket full of coins.
2193830	2199233	So I'm sitting there shucking coins in and just playing a few rounds of poppin' music.
2199233	2201834	And then, by even 10 feet away.
2201834	2208997	For those watching live, and I just, I really apologize to the podcast listeners, but I have up on the screen right now, it looks like Ranma was playing Mario Kart at round one.
2208997	2209298	Yes.
2209298	2212719	And check out the Daisy makeover here in the corner.
2212719	2214140	I just want everybody to peep that.
2214140	2215661	There's our very own Ranma.
2216581	2218842	I think it's the 20th anniversary DDR machine or 25th one.
2218842	2219822	It's a gold machine.
2219822	2222023	And I played a round of that and I had fun on that machine.
2246038	2250720	And I walked around, and I saw the Mario Kart, and I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna get into some Mario Kart.
2250720	2252301	And I noticed something.
2252301	2258283	The Mario Kart machines there take these special, uh, Amy cards.
2258283	2263505	And I went out and bought one of those for like 300 yen, which is like 2 bucks.
2263505	2267887	So that- so I could keep track of- of- of my- of- of my gameplay.
2267887	2268848	And I went through...
2269628	2271809	the 50cc course, which was fun.
2271809	2276970	I jumped to the 100cc course where you actually have to drift in order to stay in first.
2276970	2279810	I'm like, oh, it's like that now?
2279810	2282831	Okay, let's play.
2282831	2286752	Um, in your photo gallery, I've made my way to this like Dragon Quest store.
2286752	2292113	It's looks like a, isn't Lawson like a 7-Eleven type of thing in Japan?
2292113	2292634	I could be wrong.
2292634	2293154	Yes.
2293154	2293374	Okay.
2293374	2294134	Yes.
2294134	2295154	So you are correct.
2295154	2295454	Okay.
2295454	2296494	What is this all about?
2296494	2297775	Like a Dragon Quest themed 7-Eleven?
2298772	2300352	Yes it is.
2300352	2306294	In Osaka, there is a Lost Sins family mart that's Dragon Quest themed.
2306294	2312335	And when you walk in, you hear the same sound effect as you walk into a town in a Dragon Quest video game.
2312335	2313796	Okay, that's funny.
2313796	2316416	I had to take pictures of all the cool stuff there.
2316416	2318577	I was like, this is way too awesome.
2320034	2322777	It reminds me of going into particular gas stations.
2322777	2330587	I don't know if this is around the country, but I know in here, like certain Chevrons, you go into the minimart and the sound of the cash register is the fucking sonic ring sound.
2330587	2337675	And I don't know if those are like licensed in the same library or something, but it always throws me like I walk in and hear the sonic ring sounds at certain minimarts.
2339093	2339914	Wild Wild
2357492	2359053	Oh, that looks like a lot of fun.
2359053	2369061	So it's it definitely seems like you've got an increased amount of like presence for, you know, video game embedded in the culture.
2369061	2374426	And I think a lot of us probably are aware that like, obviously, Japan kind of appreciates video games, their cultures.
2375026	2377348	a little more than we historically have.
2377348	2379009	I would argue it's growing here.
2379009	2380430	It's still not at that level.
2380430	2389437	But like, I don't think video games are really looked down on because most the adults, the people that are the adults now us, we grew up with video games.
2389437	2391138	So it's not as like fringe as it used to be.
2391138	2394461	But yeah, you don't see like a Dragon Quest themed 7-Eleven here.
2394461	2399504	But I remember them theming some of them for the Simpsons when the Simpsons movie came out.
2399504	2404248	So I've seen him do it for other things in pop culture, but never just never that.
2405114	2416616	See, Rob, one thing I did notice while I was in Japan, like, I saw, like, collaborations and advertisers for the latest Spy Family movie, Spy Family Code White.
2416616	2427438	And it reminds me of something where, in Japan, anime is treated like no different from a live primetime television series.
2427438	2434660	So, like, all the love that Survivor gets here in the U.S., with popularity and so forth,
2435325	2438067	In Japan it could be Pokemon.
2438067	2438708	Simple as that.
2458254	2459456	But yeah, okay.
2459456	2464423	There's some cute little ads in this gallery we're looking at now on the... Oh, a Sailor Moon store.
2464423	2465685	Get out and don't tell my husband.
2467114	2472177	Um, I, well, don't tell him I dropped almost $200 in the Sailor Moon store.
2472177	2473577	Well, I don't blame you, to be honest.
2473577	2475978	Here's a giant ad for Pikmin 4.
2475978	2479580	That was an ad on, well, I was on the subway system.
2479580	2480241	So there you go.
2480241	2482422	It's again, it's one of those things where, yeah.
2482422	2483302	Now, okay.
2483302	2484223	Let's talk about this real quick.
2484223	2485483	This is a little bit different than video games.
2485483	2486344	Oh, KFC.
2486344	2489385	It's that, it was that time of year to have your KFC for Christmas.
2489385	2491566	I was going to say you were there on Christmas day, right?
2491566	2492887	Did you have a Kentucky Fried Christmas?
2493854	2500099	Yes, let me tell you, I was in Osaka, and I found the KFC, and I go over to get on the line.
2500099	2503461	The associate is telling me I gotta go over to the other side.
2503461	2506783	I walk to the other side, and I see these stairs.
2506783	2507824	People are lined up.
2507824	2510086	I was just like, wait.
2510086	2511907	I get on the line.
2511907	2518372	I waited about 20 to 25 minutes, got my order, went back to my hotel, sat down, and ate it.
2519943	2524387	My brother in Christ, I have never had KFC so delicious in my entire life.
2524387	2528730	I mean, I have, but it's been like years.
2528730	2536796	I mean, I think when I was a kid, that was the last time I had KFC that delicious, that tasty.
2536796	2537677	And I was just like, wow.
2537677	2539338	The chicken tastes better on holidays.
2539338	2539919	That's just fact.
2542296	2547297	I had McDonald's when I was out there and it tasted a lot better than the McDonald's I've had here.
2547297	2552239	It's the whole fact that there's more care put into the work one presents.
2552239	2555280	It's very much a cultural thing.
2555280	2559721	And the quality of the meat is a lot higher than it is here.
2561014	2564956	Um, now I'm looking at your photo gallery, and it looks like you went by this store.
2564956	2572560	And what caught me interesting about this store, you're at this store called Game Station, it looks like, but they've actually got a Fallout 76 ad in the window.
2572560	2575622	That is interesting to me, because of course, that is not a game developed in Japan.
2575622	2576643	That's something over here.
2576643	2578764	So I'm was, was this like a
2582525	2591708	I think it was like a secondhand type store where they get all types of stuff in there.
2591708	2596350	I believe that's why I went to Nakano Broadway which is like four floors of
2597645	2599066	Nerd stuff.
2599066	2599706	Oh, yeah.
2599706	2600727	Look at this in the store.
2600727	2604329	It's Five Nights at Freddy's, Minecraft, Nuka Cola.
2604329	2606010	There's a Skyrim shirt.
2606010	2609052	So this really is like shit big in America.
2609052	2610173	That's not big in Japan.
2610173	2611394	That's interesting.
2611394	2614156	Did you go to like a book off or a game off or?
2614156	2617218	Yes, I went to a book off and.
2617218	2620840	Amy, I made out like a bandit.
2620840	2621460	Oh, there we go.
2621460	2622061	Oh, my God.
2622061	2624682	If I had known that you were going somewhere that had Transformers.
2627332	2632784	I would have sent you over more than just for my cup.
2632784	2635511	Dan's been really big back into collecting Otus Transformers.
2637625	2646049	Man, let me tell you, when I was in Japan, I get an email from Amazon about my Sailor Venus cuposkets.
2646049	2649351	They've changed the street date to unknown.
2649351	2650231	So I said, you know what?
2650231	2652012	I'm going to try to find it when I was there.
2652012	2654773	I found both of the figures that I wanted.
2654773	2660336	I paid a total of 4,000 yen after tax, which is at the time a little bit over $25.
2660336	2664018	Yeah, that's a lot cheaper than...
2666542	2668163	and I can't, I canceled my pre-orders.
2668163	2674468	And the best part is it says on the packages, unopened, but I bought a lot of secondhand stuff.
2674468	2681873	And from looking at it, you can't tell it's secondhand because of the care that people put into it.
2681873	2693162	Like right now I'm- Oh no, you can go like designer bag shopping in like say Ginza or Bropungi.
2693162	2695804	And like, I'm talking like Chanel.
2697843	2699785	Dior, you name it.
2699785	2707773	And even if it's like the only tiniest little defect, it's enough to mark something down to almost 25% of what it originally cost.
2707773	2710396	Yes, that is 100% correct.
2710396	2717343	Because some, like I said, some of the stuff I saw, like I saw somebody sell something, it was brand new.
2717343	2720366	All he did was open the box and look at it and put it right back in the box.
2721058	2722299	Massive markdown!
2722299	2729504	Like, right now I'm holding one of the Ranma 1.5 games for Duo CD.
2729504	2732406	I paid... PC Engine Duo?
2732406	2733307	Yeah.
2733307	2734008	PC Engine Duo.
2734008	2734408	Yeah.
2734408	2736870	I paid a little bit over 2,000 yen after tax.
2736870	2744135	If I were to take, like, the paid stickers off and look at it, I swear, this looks like it's brand new.
2744135	2746577	There's so much care and love.
2746577	2749219	All you need is a duo, right?
2749219	2749319	Um...
2750399	2751160	VOG Network, DJ Ranma S
2766332	2771013	then people are definitely charging up for them, like 300 bucks for the system.
2771013	2781995	But sometimes you can just get, like, the Core Graphics unit, which is just like the TurboGrafx, like the plain base TurboGrafx.
2781995	2787136	You can get the Core Graphics that uses Japanese HuCards pretty inexpensively.
2787136	2792137	And then you can sometimes find the Duo add-on a little bit less expensively.
2792857	2799443	What's going to get you is, depending on what kind of card that they take, like if it's an arcade card, those are going to be pretty pricey.
2799443	2812715	That's why I was saying you'll want a Japanese core graphics, because the converters for the HuCards, they don't always work, and they're sometimes more expensive than the systems.
2814170	2816453	I know you guys are talking about games.
2834571	2837552	Oh sorry, which is important in what this show is about.
2837552	2839853	Go ahead, Jamie.
2839853	2841974	It's just one last little thing.
2841974	2844855	This will help people who decide to import games.
2844855	2851438	You can use an American Turbo Duo and it will play most of those games because it has it built in, but you'll need to actually have a full Turbo Duo.
2853342	2857244	Okay, so obviously, I'm trying to interject because sorry, no, you're fine.
2857244	2860186	Because you all are talking about games is what this show is really about.
2860186	2863387	But you all know that there is a secret second topic on this show.
2863387	2864748	And that is food.
2864748	2877475	So Rama, I have to ask you this, because I'm looking at this fucking divine looking bakery, like I see all of these donuts, like I'm crying in diabetes right now, but I would I would have just a bite or five.
2878055	2879856	of many of these divine samplings in here.
2879856	2882318	And we even have like video game themed things here.
2882318	2888923	We've got like little Pikachu and Snorlax themed, you know, like donuts there and all of this stuff.
2888923	2891244	And I noticed you got all these pictures of the cases.
2891244	2894206	Ranma, now I got to read a bitch for a minute here.
2894206	2897468	You've got all of these divine donut offerings.
2897468	2902352	And then I see in the next picture, you bought the plainest fucking donut on the rack.
2902352	2903693	Explain yourself.
2904213	2908617	You ate the plainest fucking donut you could in Japan.
2908617	2911420	What is wrong with you?
2911420	2914422	You have to blame the medication that I am on.
2914422	2915363	I'm sorry.
2915363	2916925	Okay, fine, fine.
2916925	2917505	All right.
2917505	2919447	All right.
2919447	2923310	As a diabetic, I shouldn't be bitching, but I could.
2923310	2924151	It made me laugh.
2924151	2927414	I'm like, like anything in that case he could have ordered.
2928277	2930838	Rob, let me tell you something.
2930838	2938960	If you saw the pictures of the food that I ate there, oh, you'd be one angry bitch, okay?
2938960	2939500	No, I would.
2939500	2945381	But if you tasted some of the food that I had, you'd swear you have died and gone to heaven.
2945381	2953203	I mean, I've had real sushi and sashimi, and I was just like, oh my God, this is delicious.
2953203	2957124	I had beef sushi, and I was just like, this is a thing?
2957124	2957624	Oh, yes.
2958144	2962968	Rama goes to Japan and just the most divine baked goods you've ever seen here.
2984006	2988467	orders a fucking plain donut.
2988467	2989028	Okay.
2989028	2989328	All right.
2989328	2989708	Okay.
2989708	2990328	All right.
2990328	2991068	All right.
2991068	2994449	Let me explain that again.
2994449	2996770	I'm on medication for weight loss.
2996770	2999330	You don't have to justify it.
2999330	3001371	It's funny more than anything.
3001371	3002071	I know.
3002071	3011074	Just saying, as I'm walking around building up my hunger, I'm just like, I just wanted to get something, you know, to try.
3011074	3011274	Yeah.
3012250	3014492	We all know Dunkin Donuts, right?
3014492	3015814	Sure, of course.
3015814	3021839	To summarize, they had a chain in Japan, sold it off, and it became Mr. Donut.
3021839	3023741	And that's basically where I went.
3023741	3027165	Oh, that was way better than any Dunkin Donuts I've ever seen.
3027904	3031729	I had a plain honey dip donut from Mr. Donut.
3031729	3035653	I had Japanese coffee, which is absolutely delicious.
3035653	3038957	I came back with four bags of it, okay?
3038957	3041901	I just wanted to try the Mr. Donut.
3041901	3047587	I will be going back to Japan soon, and I promise you I will try the different Pokemon.
3048692	3050193	All right, I love that.
3050193	3058120	But now I'm looking at some of the other pictures you got, you got some, but then wait, not only do you have this yummy, you know, dish here and then this is a very pretty, I love this.
3058120	3061543	And then why did you take a picture of Shake Shack?
3061543	3069289	Because I had to, I got, I got off the subway and I turned and I just go, Oh my God, it's a Shake Shack.
3069289	3073272	It's the same fucking thing you can see in any town.
3073272	3074754	It's a Shake Shack, Ranma.
3075717	3082243	Rob, I saw a Shen Yun advertisement when I was on the train.
3082243	3089250	When I was going to Ikebukuro, I saw an advertisement for Shen Yun and I'm just like, are you serious right now?
3089250	3092513	Clearly nature is back.
3092513	3093874	I wish you could take a picture of this.
3093874	3096657	I'm like, nobody's going to believe me.
3101070	3102210	Anyway, all right.
3102210	3103931	I know I know we want to get into some other stuff.
3103931	3109013	I don't want to, you know, but I'm sure you and I'm sure you'll talk about this a lot more on Anime Jam session as well.
3109013	3121077	But you know, just kind of any other takeaways, especially remembering like, you know, this is gaming and gaming culture show just kind of like any other like takeaways about, like how it was different in Japan to you than what you're used to seeing here.
3122130	3127754	I forget the proper term for it, but it's called the Spirit of Hospitality.
3127754	3146265	That is basically what I saw when I went into Animate, or BookOff, or Surugaya, or Super Potato, seeing all these second-hand video games and arcade anime swag and so forth, looking to see the care and maticulation of it.
3146265	3151669	Again, you'd swear it's something brand new that someone just bought, and they're just putting it out on display.
3153398	3158639	It's just the love and care that I saw that made me feel like, you know what?
3158639	3159419	I love this.
3159419	3161440	This is not hard.
3161440	3176443	Like, when I was at Super Potato, I saw a bunch of video games that didn't have boxes or manuals, but the way the carts were laid there and pristine wrapped, and it's like... You can tell there's love behind all of this.
3176443	3179404	Um, are you- There's pride in your work.
3179404	3179564	Yup.
3180510	3185074	Surely you're thinking about already going back.
3185074	3186376	Yes, I am.
3186376	3187877	And taking me with you.
3187877	3188417	And me.
3188417	3189739	Yes.
3189739	3191821	I will tell you this now.
3191821	3204933	The best advice I can say if you're going there as an anime fan or a gaming fan, if you want to buy stuff, make sure that you can take two carry ons and save Akihabara for last.
3206038	3230264	because that's where you could be doing the bulk of your shopping even though I was in Bendintown which is better known as Nihonbashi where you saw the gaming photos as in Osaka but there's more over in Akihabara and I say that because there is a Don Quijote right up the street where you could pick up a second bag for 15 bucks to pack your stuff in and go
3231638	3232799	Okay.
3232799	3240825	Well, I'm going to close with just a few more of Ranma's photos here because I've got a few more food shots here and we'll kind of wrap this segment with this.
3240825	3241425	I love this.
3241425	3243607	You got to like a nice Diwali presentation.
3243607	3245548	And, you know, for me, I'm very happy.
3245548	3247269	I see everything's in English as well.
3247269	3251372	So I feel like I wouldn't be too lost if I went to Japan, but you got some very lovely things there.
3251372	3256576	And then you have another, it looks like another picture of the menu here, and then just, you know, some more food.
3256576	3258077	And then we just end it with beer 30.
3259358	3262759	Yeah, that is an actual restaurant that I walked by, you know.
3262759	3268461	It was a fast food, it was a regular sit-down restaurant with different types of beers on tap.
3268461	3270782	Guess what time it is.
3270782	3275343	And I will tell you this, I went to this place called, I think it's called Meat and Beer.
3275343	3276083	I have a picture of it.
3276083	3279464	I sat down, had a beef bowl and a beer.
3279464	3286866	I paid 1,200 yen for it, under-converted, that's about $8 for a full meal.
3286866	3288367	You can't beat that.
3289807	3298572	It's a lot cheaper to eat out in Japan than it is to just go grocery shopping.
3298572	3307216	One of my friends just checked up at an Airbnb in Kyoto and lived there for like four months.
3307216	3312619	And it was like, it was inexpensive and everything was accessible and yeah.
3314569	3323737	Especially if you're in Tokyo, traveling throughout the trains is just simply amazing, and it's so easy.
3323737	3326760	Just don't use your cell phone.
3326760	3328041	If you have an iPhone, you're good.
3328041	3331844	If you're Andrew, like me, you're going to need an IC card.
3334468	3336510	which I have one right here.
3336510	3340914	I just understood it was discouraged to be on your phone on the train.
3340914	3343596	Actually, not anymore.
3343596	3346138	There are people who are using their phones as per normal.
3346138	3349621	I have seen people eating and drinking on the platforms.
3349621	3355726	From what Evan has told me, as long as you're not publicly intoxicated, it's kind of sort of fair game.
3355726	3356707	Oh, interesting.
3356707	3357268	Yeah.
3358430	3367620	Oh, yeah, you got to meet up with Evan from well, he was affiliated with Electric Sisterhood some time ago and wrote for their website and all that stuff when they were still around.
3367620	3370283	So and he's out there doing like teaching now, right?
3371110	3374271	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3396368	3398191	Yeah, I can.
3398191	3400033	I really didn't play a whole lot.
3400033	3408604	You know, I felt fine a week until I had my COVID shot, and I'm already starting to feel a little bit better, just, you know, I'm drifting off.
3408604	3409125	But I...
3411688	3416874	I did my first sponsored stream for Genshin Impact, and you want to know what's sad?
3416874	3418675	Game's fucking fun.
3418675	3419476	It's sad.
3419476	3421999	There's a lot of people super into it.
3421999	3425682	But I still want to boot Paimon off a cliff.
3425682	3428505	There's a reason why they call it Weeb Breath of the Wild.
3428505	3428865	But like,
3434478	3446469	There's like a thing for my sponsorship that if I play with somebody for like 30 minutes on a stream, like a co-op or something, that they'll do something, I don't know.
3446469	3459962	But at any rate, you know, I went into it with no expectations and left very, very pleased with it, although I really wish I could change the language so that I don't have to hear Paimon's voice.
3463745	3471493	It was cool, definitely a little bit simplistic and the location system in the game definitely gives you some work.
3471493	3473815	But I was pleased with it.
3473815	3481162	And then I did some of the new DLC for Cult of the Lamb, The Sins of the Flesh.
3481162	3482884	You can go around doing naked dances.
3484566	3490714	There is a rhythm game section in there, which is really hard to do on the controller.
3490714	3499107	I'm even thinking about just doing that part on the keyboard, but you play drums and it's very simple poppin' music with three buttons.
3501369	3503091	And then you can get people drunk.
3503091	3507936	Rob, I made very sure to make a special drink just for you in my village.
3507936	3508476	Oh, yeah.
3508476	3511519	Or my my compound, I should say.
3511519	3514222	And you were very, very drunk.
3514222	3517465	You probably opened a wine cooler and I passed out.
3517465	3520208	Oh, it was a very beautiful, fruity drink.
3520208	3522050	OK, well, that's how I like it.
3522050	3523011	I give everyone else beer.
3524694	3541546	Um, and then, um, you know, going back through and doing, like, if you have, if you elected to have the one who waits, um, be one of your minions, then they keep giving you quest lines to go and retrieve certain things from the other areas.
3541546	3547591	But I remembered reading in the, the information for the pack that there was supposed to be another area open up.
3548651	3565047	Um, I don't know, but you can still also get, you know, I've already gotten all of the, like, the special buildings, so I did the, uh, what is it that they call it, when you get enough, uh, soul energy, you can upgrade things in your town or get new items.
3566529	3570551	They've addressed some of people's complaints.
3570551	3576695	Like they have extra storage for grains that the little grain silos can be filled out of.
3576695	3582839	And then they have the thing that holds like 1,200 pieces of poop.
3582839	3585481	And then they have magic poop.
3585481	3587682	Like you can get a golden poop.
3587682	3588683	I don't remember what it is.
3588683	3590064	When you pick it up, it gives you money.
3591104	3600836	And there's like, I don't know what like all the poops do, but there's a rainbow poop, and it makes whatever you put it on grow like immediately.
3600836	3602138	And, um...
3603812	3623159	There's just, there's just neat stuff and you can, like, you have this whole Sin currency in the game now, too, where if someone, like, has gone and done some Sin stuff and the Sin starts taking over, you can go absorb them and absorb their Sin and then use it to go shopping.
3623159	3628922	Like, if I could just pay Sin to go shopping, then... I wish I could go to Japan and just buy stuff with Sin.
3628922	3629402	That'd be fun.
3633374	3636438	I did play Dead by Daylight.
3650356	3659542	I'm not going to be doing that tonight because I don't have the mental fortitude to play killer tonight and deal with people.
3659542	3669748	But I did... People are being stinky because Rank Reset just happened, you know, not long ago.
3669748	3674791	And then there's the PTB that happened because we're now getting Alan Wake.
3675538	3690815	right i forgot to bring that up but that's uh that's cool it's an interesting cross i like in in his little intro that you know how like for all the other survivors they show them getting mercilessly murdered at the end of their thing or whatever not him
3692335	3693716	He's like, do you know who I am?
3693716	3696238	I'm Alan Wake, motherfucker.
3696238	3697318	Look at my flashlight.
3697318	3700020	All of his stuff is flashlight based.
3700020	3700420	Of course.
3700420	3704503	So I probably I'm probably going to hate getting his adept.
3704503	3706464	Oh, yeah.
3706464	3712368	But yeah, that was pretty much my my gaming week.
3712368	3718412	And apart from just watching all the fun on AGDQ, that was that was pretty great.
3721408	3733285	But yeah, I mean, like I said, normally I would be doing Killer Night tonight on Dead by Daylight, but I think the only thing I'll be killing is my mattress when I pass out on it.
3733951	3734512	All good.
3734512	3734852	All good.
3734852	3736313	We understand you're under the weather.
3736313	3737734	Well, I hate to make you keep talking.
3737734	3741857	But before you head out, I know you wanted to touch on the classic game of the week this week.
3741857	3744259	So we're gonna kind of wait for you guys to do your parts.
3744259	3744599	Oh, okay.
3744599	3745320	I can do class.
3745320	3746741	Oh, you're good.
3746741	3751205	I'll just I'll just sit here in and listen.
3751205	3755468	Okay, but like, I've literally been nodding off in between stories.
3755468	3755748	All good.
3755748	3757770	Do you want me to take care of the stories you were set to do?
3759065	3759966	if you don't mind.
3759966	3760747	All right, you got it.
3760747	3767777	But but I can't but you get your you get your your weeks out of the way and I'll do classic game and then I'll just chill here.
3767777	3769259	Okay, sounds good.
3769259	3773444	Um, so let's go to then, Ranma, your your classic game of the week.
3774906	3776107	Oh my god, my wires are gone.
3776107	3778469	See, everything is breaking down tonight.
3778469	3779990	It's all breaking down.
3779990	3782131	Let's try, how about your gaming week?
3782131	3784113	I didn't intend on getting sick.
3784113	3787756	Okay, this is what we call the Curse of the Koi.
3787756	3791919	Yeah, this is a complete malfunction, meltdown.
3791919	3793560	That's what's happening.
3793560	3794962	It's called the Curse of the Koi.
3794962	3797944	On my show, we have someone named Koi.
3797944	3800366	For some reason, whenever she tries to join the show,
3801772	3804633	Hardware failures, software failures across the board.
3804633	3806654	Don't wish that on the show.
3806654	3810175	It's got to the point where when it happens, we just go, damn it, Koi.
3810175	3814117	And then she goes, when we tell her, she's like, you're welcome.
3814117	3814557	All right.
3814557	3818998	Well, the spirit, if the spirit of Koi is in this room, knock twice.
3818998	3820579	OK.
3820579	3824460	Anyway, Ranma, how was your gaming week?
3824460	3825221	It was pretty good.
3826880	3837548	Mondays when I get home from work, I join my friend Kurohikari-chan, and we jump on Discord and join the Alliance, and we play Phantasy Star Online 2.
3837548	3844213	So I do that every week for a few hours, and the rest of them are just going at it.
3844213	3850158	And the last time I logged in last week, I've noticed I have logged over 700 hours into the game.
3850158	3851719	I'm just like, oh wow.
3852870	3861878	Meanwhile, my weapons and stuff is not as nice as theirs, but we still do LTQs and all that good stuff, which is kind of fun.
3861878	3875930	Uh, when I'm at work and I have some free time, I see- I find myself playing, like, Monopoly Go, or Angry Birds, Bubble Blast, or that- that- that royal game that- that keeps advertising.
3875930	3877492	I just downloaded- Oh god, you play that?
3878703	3888102	tired of seeing the advertisements i'm just like you know i'm gonna see what this is all about so all right well it's it's a sit-down game when you're in the other office that's all that is
3889563	3906090	And, yes, as I've said, I did put some time in on Power World, which is no longer, and I switched, and after my frustration of the game, I switched that off, and I went back to playing Yohane the Parhelion, Sunshine in the Mirror, and that's basically, it's a Metroidvania game.
3906090	3913633	Long story short, you have to find the rest of her friends, and you get all these mystic items and so forth, and you just gotta rescue them.
3913633	3915934	It's kind of fun.
3915934	3917135	Okay.
3917135	3917355	Nice.
3919022	3920662	Anything else?
3920662	3922043	Ah, that's basically it.
3922043	3928524	I'm hoping that once I'm done with Yohane the Pahelion, I can actually finish Crisis Core.
3928524	3935825	I could try to get more... I could finish Cobra Kai, because less than, like, what, 30-something days?
3935825	3944707	FF7 Rebirth drops, so, you know, I gotta get that PS5 and do the Remake Integrate, and then jump right into that, so...
3945666	3948528	Yeah, I need to do a replay on PS5 before that comes out.
3948528	3952371	And because I never did the yeah, I never did the Yuffie part.
3952371	3958135	I started it because I remember it was I was at Bobby's house when that first came out with the PSR.
3958135	3961338	Well, not like when it first came out, but like the Dragon Con right around then.
3961338	3967062	And I remember playing the beginning of it, but I needed to see kind of the whole thing start to finish, obviously, which I still haven't done.
3967062	3968884	So.
3968884	3969524	Yeah.
3969524	3970385	All right.
3971283	3971943	my gaming week.
3971943	3974905	So yeah, I did play a little bit of pal world.
3974905	3979588	I don't think I did anything extremely notable, but just enough to get a sense of what the game was all about.
3979588	3985431	But other stuff I played Diablo three, I was continuing on with the current season that had started.
3985431	3989313	So I got I got two characters to 70 because I started with a necromancer.
3989313	3991895	And then I was like, I think I want to play Demon Hunter.
3991895	3992936	So I switched to Demon Hunter.
3992936	3994556	And so I was playing a little bit of that.
3994556	3997238	But I'll be going back to Diablo four because now see
3997498	3998139	and DJ Ranma S
4012952	4017115	At least the wrist pad's not RGB so you don't have to worry about that type of damage.
4031346	4032727	Anyway, where was I?
4032727	4037169	So Diablo 4, Season 3 is starting this week, so I'll be checking that out.
4037169	4048174	And then Final Fantasy XIV, the 6.55 patch came out that has the story that now really leads us to Dawn Trail, and they were really setting up the story for that.
4048174	4054077	And it was cute, and they brought the first female Hrothgar,
4054537	4054857	FF14 Players
4084797	4091382	But one of my friends that I hang out with in real life really enjoys shooty games like Overwatch.
4091382	4093624	And so we play Overwatch together.
4093624	4097106	And so I've been, I feel like I'm getting better.
4097106	4100789	I feel like I'm getting really good with Life Weaver.
4100789	4102871	But my friend says it's just because he's easy.
4103683	4104063	I know.
4104063	4105804	I also feel like I'm really good with Moira.
4126573	4133736	Like when there's a Sombra that's pissing me off or, you know, somebody that I feel like Moira is kind of like my go-to to be a little bit of a sneaky bitch.
4133736	4139939	And I know a lot of people roll their eyes when they hear Moira on support, because a lot of Moiras go DPS Moira.
4139939	4143841	But I feel like I throw plenty of heal balls when it's appropriate.
4143841	4145401	I don't just use DPS balls.
4145401	4146682	So heal, please.
4146682	4147282	Exactly.
4147282	4148082	Heal, please.
4148082	4152004	And believe me, that culture is alive and well in Overwatch.
4152004	4154705	Somebody can be full health and it's like, I need healing.
4154705	4155586	I need healing.
4155586	4156086	I need healing.
4156346	4183745	warp prompt oh my god all of it culverts but I just imagine that everybody has the same problem I have where I have chubby fingers and I accidentally hit the key bind all the time for I need healing like as a healer and these people in the game must think I'm a loon because I'm like it's like but my fat keys hit the wrong or my fat fingers hit the wrong keys all the time so what can you do
4185253	4187114	So that was my gaming week.
4187114	4188395	All right.
4188395	4190516	Um, we're getting into the news now.
4190516	4191316	Yes.
4191316	4192497	Let's do it.
4192497	4194578	Okay, so we do want to do a classic game.
4194578	4195678	Okay, that's fine.
4195678	4197879	Let's do a classic game.
4197879	4199040	And no, that's fine.
4199040	4200721	We'll get set up to do that.
4200721	4201721	We must roll the bumper.
4201721	4206383	I made a boo-boo with the classic game though, because it was aiming for January 2014.
4206383	4209725	And this is October 2014.
4209725	4211266	But it counts, because I said so.
4212771	4213832	DarkSakura IGDAF
4248863	4256625	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4256625	4261487	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4261487	4262247	All right.
4262247	4269549	So still, even even if we're talking about a game that's nine and a half years old, this is still pretty.
4269549	4270970	I'm impressed that this game is that old.
4270970	4273391	What'd you pick tonight, DarkSakura?
4273391	4274331	Alien Isolation.
4276326	4287376	which I can't play this game because it makes me really motion sick, but I freaking love the game so much and diving into it.
4287376	4290719	So at any rate, the game came out in 2014.
4290719	4295643	It's a survival horror game that was developed by Creative Assembly and it was published by Sega.
4295643	4301528	It came out on PS3, PS4, for Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.
4302809	4315838	and it is based off of the Alien series that's 15 years after the original 1979 film where you play Amanda Ripley who is the daughter of Ellen Ripley.
4318086	4325972	She's basically been looking for all these clues about what happened to her mom and trying to find her.
4325972	4337462	You get a lot about her story too, about how Weyland-Yutani tried to pay for all of her education and do all of this, and then she turned her back on them once she was old enough.
4339363	4353653	So it's a lot of her own ingenuity and sometimes, I mean, you can tell she's like really freaked out during the whole thing, but she perseveres despite her fear.
4353653	4355835	So yeah, I really like the character.
4356415	4358475	Oh, and she's just like a real person.
4358475	4360436	She can be a bitch to people.
4360436	4363396	And, you know, she makes mistakes.
4363396	4365437	I love how fleshed out she is.
4365437	4377399	The other thing that's cool about this game is that it mimics the aesthetic of the first movie.
4377399	4383460	Well, and the second movie was even more in the same lens as the aesthetic, just, you know, a bit more
4384620	4390485	You know, what would have been a natural progression of aesthetics and design.
4390485	4400312	Not like, oh, we're going to do Prometheus, where all of our technology looks like it's from bajillion years after the movie we're supposed to be a prequel to.
4400312	4402073	No comment.
4402073	4404635	But it is it is a
4407048	4416691	It was originally intended to be a third-person game, but they used first-person to give it a more intense mood and feel.
4416691	4420292	There are DLC packs.
4420292	4424853	There's even one that recreates scenes from Aliens.
4424853	4432015	And as I recall, I want to say that they got some of the original actors to reprise their roles.
4432015	4433076	Of course, no John Hurt.
4435778	4445550	Those scenes were set after his character had explosive front-end diarrhea in the form of an alien.
4453496	4463261	It does have some AI built in that controls the aliens' movements, which is proper use of AI.
4463261	4465543	Hello!
4465543	4470365	A lot of the designs were based around the AI that guides the aliens' movements.
4470365	4473927	It was very sophisticated.
4473927	4475628	There have been many ports of this game.
4475628	4477629	We'll be getting into that in a little bit.
4477629	4480071	Even a television adaptation, which
4480811	4484495	You can watch Link through IGN.
4484495	4487238	But anyway, it is single player.
4487238	4491181	It has a massive emphasis on your stealth.
4491181	4498108	Because when that alien comes down, it can hear and smell and...
4499310	4503054	It's pretty, pretty on the ball.
4503054	4512624	You can run and climb ladders, go through vents, crouch behind objects, basically breaking line of sight to do stuff like that.
4512624	4514526	And the alien is not your only enemy.
4516549	4522117	You can hide under tables or go into empty lockers, you know.
4522117	4529448	But some of the hostiles are the other humans on the Sevastopol station where you arrive.
4532193	4538079	There are these series of androids that are called, um, what were they called?
4538079	4538960	Working Joes.
4538960	4542283	I have to see if I can find the name in here.
4542283	4549490	Um, but you, you arrive after they've already had, uh, an alien incident.
4549490	4556857	Um, and it just reiterates a lot of the themes that go on in some of the alien movies, how humans are stupid.
4559673	4567659	I mean, it really is a lot of my emotions have overridden logic is what these are.
4567659	4573383	It's definitely a game worth going back and playing, or at least watching a good playthrough.
4573383	4583390	But the whole thing that brings Amanda there is that a representative of the company, who you find out is an android,
4584919	4591966	He arrives and says that they found the Nostromo's flight recorder.
4591966	4599453	And it was found on a salvage ship called the Anesidora and was brought on Sevastopol Station.
4599453	4609943	So, of course, with what happened with the Nostromo and the fact that, of course, the company knows what the Nostromo was going out there for, they ended up
4610638	4615841	You know, wanting to take control of that black box, to retrieve it.
4615841	4622845	But when they get onto the colony, of course, it's mayhem, everything is shut down.
4625814	4646371	But it was all caused by one of the, by the captain of the Anesidora when it was his wife who, after they went to explore the derelict ship on that planet, you know, the same one from Alien.
4649113	4660399	She basically, they, he insisted she break quarantine, come on the ship, got her to Sevastopol and the chestburster popped out and we know what happened from there.
4660399	4678649	And so, uh, you are fighting the station's AI Apollo, um, who has put in like different measures to try to control what's going on and keep the, the, uh, the being contained, the alien contained.
4681114	4689041	And that Seegson, which is the company that controls Sevastopol Station, actually sold it to Weyland-Yutani.
4689041	4693084	And that's why Apollo is trying to protect the alien.
4693084	4701532	And so basically it's a lot of her trying to go in and survive and find the flight recorder.
4702592	4708734	And, you know, try to save as many people as she can.
4708734	4713176	But just all kinds of stuff, you know, goes on.
4713176	4715637	She does not have a good day of it.
4715637	4720799	Like, even going through some of the same things that Ripley went through at the end.
4724079	4728203	And of course, there are many spinoffs from this.
4728203	4732006	I read the comics that she was in, it was really good.
4732006	4738391	But this was... Basically, they had...
4741431	4747475	conceived the game after finishing Viking Battle for Asgard with Sega.
4747475	4751677	And of course, Sega had acquired the license for Aliens games in December 2006.
4751677	4763604	And so they put the first prototype out there, where basically one person controlled the alien and the other would try to hide from the alien, you know, and Sega was like, we like this.
4766186	4780764	And it was based of course more off of Alien as opposed to Aliens, but there were a few things that of course were included as nods to stuff that goes on in Aliens.
4782445	4791249	They really were trying to maintain that retro-futuristic atmosphere.
4791249	4798632	Fox, the studio, provided them with 3 terabytes of production material.
4798632	4807175	That included costume photography, concept art, set design, behind-the-scenes photos, videos, and the film's original sound effect recording.
4809540	4814304	they were able to get things that nobody had seen.
4814304	4820589	You know, if you didn't work on the movie, you didn't, you didn't know any of this.
4820589	4824072	And so it shows in the production quality.
4824072	4825753	The game is, you know, amazing.
4825753	4835901	Like you have the chunky, you know, phone receivers, monochrome displays, CRT monitors with distortion, and even some with burn-in.
4836481	4865437	You have they recorded the animations these monitors for on the VHS and Betamax recorders and you know, they They really went all out for the effects I mean, I can't say enough good and it also does run on a proprietary engine that was used in Viking Battle for Asgard, but it was tweaked to include the atmospheric and lighting effects and the way that the alien behaves and
4866437	4879825	It also incorporates deferred rendering so that they can put hundreds of dynamic lights in a scene and, you know, have it work properly and not take up too many resources.
4879825	4885388	You know, it's just, it's a very, very amazing system that they worked out there.
4885388	4888550	Today, it would still, you know, go.
4888550	4891692	And they had some canceled things that were in there.
4891692	4893653	Like, they,
4894711	4906794	They wanted to have, like, people fashioning weapons, but there was more to the game than just, you know, weapons and shooting.
4906794	4920597	They wanted to also include the alien's blood as an in-game mechanic, you know, so that, like, you could melt through some things as part of a puzzle, but then they thought, said it would take that into a, quote, weird direction.
4923872	4932426	I'm hoping, because they said that a lot of it was developed with a third person view and I would love to see if someone's modded that back in.
4932426	4938555	But skipping past some of the marketing stuff, there is DLC including Crew Expendable.
4939477	4941859	and Last Survivor.
4941859	4944441	They were made available when the game came out.
4944441	4959536	So Crew Expendable included the Nostromo edition which was the scene from, recreated a scene from Alien and involved the player controlling either Ripley, Dallas, or Parker trying to flush the creature out of the Nostromo's air vents into the airlock.
4960237	4971865	Which, as I recall, I think was actually more based out of a deleted scene from the original movie that might have been reincorporated into the director's cut.
4971865	4977889	Last Survivor was also made available to players who pre-ordered.
4977889	4986715	And you control Ripley as she tries to activate the Nostromo self-destruct sequence and escape.
4986715	4988736	Of course, Jonesy is there.
4988736	4989537	We love our Jonesy.
4990417	4993099	Good Kitty.
4993099	4996982	And then there were an initial five more DLC.
4996982	5001785	There was a survivor, expanded the survivor mode with new features.
5001785	5005367	A season pass to these could be purchased.
5005367	5009009	There's also Corporate Lockdown, where you would play as
5010130	5013853	Different corporate people that you just hear from in the periphery.
5013853	5019037	There's another one called Trauma that had a new character you could use on different maps.
5019037	5031946	There's Safe Haven with another new character that, you know, basically they're just like NPCs through the normal one or background characters and you get to play as them and see what their story was.
5031946	5035229	The game had really, I mean,
5035909	5041894	It had pretty positive reviews, although some people were just like, meh about it, and I don't know why.
5041894	5044176	Because it's really good.
5044176	5051361	You know, the design in it was very well received.
5051361	5055264	Certainly one of the talking points.
5055264	5059547	But a lot of people just did not care for how difficult the game was.
5059547	5062129	Even easy, the game is very difficult.
5064131	5085104	It did win some awards, PC Gamers Game of the Year 2014, Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards, Best Audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards, and four awards at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviews.
5085104	5089527	So it's got tons of accolades.
5092785	5108497	Even though the sales were weak of the game, Creative Assembly did want to do a sequel, but then most of the team that worked on the game was no longer at Creative Assembly and they were working on a first-person shooter.
5108497	5113942	So there were the comic book sequels, Aliens Resistance and Alien Rescue, both came out in 2019.
5115703	5121966	A spin-off by D3Go called Alien Blackout was put out on mobile devices.
5121966	5129749	It came out in January 2019, but it was shut down on October 31st of this past year.
5131130	5136957	There is a pinball video game adaptation.
5136957	5147890	In Aliens vs. Pinball, there is a mode for alien isolation, there's a novelization, and a streaming television series that was released on IGN.
5149091	5150832	I picked a doozy but it was worth talking about.
5173337	5173777	There it is.
5173777	5175979	For me, it was the aesthetics of it.
5175979	5182002	You know, I just was like, they've nailed this freaking universe.
5182002	5192309	And especially with, you know, just how sort of thinking of just nefarious the Weyland-Yutani Corporation was in dealing with this situation.
5192309	5195111	It's like, well, we want this.
5195111	5197932	We're going to buy your company or buy your station.
5197932	5198673	It's now us.
5198673	5200034	Everything on it is our property.
5201879	5205194	and just the way that it ends, that isolation.
5206457	5210720	You really, really feel alone in this game.
5210720	5216063	Even when you've got other people, you're spending a lot of time going off on your own.
5216063	5218025	There are ports that I forgot to mention.
5218025	5227631	There's Linux and OS X versions, which I'm sure is still going on the current Mac OS.
5227631	5232194	There's a Switch version in 2019 and then an Android and iOS version from 2021.
5232194	5236117	It is also available on Amazon Luna.
5239635	5251272	DarkSakura, I know you're heading out, so any final thoughts for us tonight before Ranma and I run through the news?
5252646	5254346	Oh, I'm sorry to leave you guys.
5254346	5258687	I'm just, if I could keep my head up, I would.
5258687	5260827	Oh, thank you for the hearts, Ran-chan.
5260827	5262928	I am doing hearts back.
5262928	5265488	Thank you, Ucha.
5265488	5271069	But I want to thank Ran-chan for my Kyoto mug from Starbucks.
5271069	5272049	I love it.
5272049	5275650	It's very pretty and I will never drink out of it.
5275650	5281011	It's going up with my Sakura mug from one of the other locations.
5282273	5291177	I have a little like a child size sippy cup that's got Sakura all over it and I'm not ever taking it out of the box.
5291177	5292598	All right.
5292598	5296019	And I just also want to thank you.
5296019	5311566	I'm feeling emotional, so I just want to thank all of our listeners and all of our friends and everybody for helping us make it through to this this year, because, I mean, it'd be really terrible if we're just talking to no one.
5312844	5314425	And we're talking to all y'all.
5314425	5315705	So thank you.
5315705	5315925	Hearts.
5315925	5317166	Yes.
5317166	5320007	There's always been at least one person we've been talking to from the very beginning.
5320007	5322347	So yeah, definitely appreciate the listeners.
5322347	5324468	Appreciate appreciate that for sure.
5324468	5325248	So all right.
5325248	5328950	And then as for me, it's over.
5328950	5330170	There you go.
5330170	5330550	All right.
5330550	5331030	Rest up.
5331030	5332331	Feel better.
5332331	5333291	Tater taters.
5333291	5333591	All right.
5333591	5334172	Take care.
5334172	5335252	Bye.
5335252	5335732	All right.
5335732	5337573	Well, how about that, Ranma?
5337573	5338393	Look at that.
5338393	5340934	Now it's just you and me running this show.
5342630	5343651	I feel like we belong.
5343651	5349154	Have you ever seen the movie Air America?
5349154	5349934	All right.
5349934	5350474	We'll get there.
5350474	5351235	We'll get through the news.
5351235	5352896	So why don't you why don't you start us off?
5352896	5354697	Tell us what's going on.
5354697	5362161	You shared this one to our Discord server, which, by the way, if you want to talk news with us throughout the week, VOG Network dot com slash Discord is the place to be.
5362161	5367103	Ranma, I caught that you shared this one, and this is the latest in a disturbing trend, right?
5367103	5368484	Yes, very.
5368484	5368584	And
5370740	5382764	I felt kind of emotional when I was, first when I was seeing like people posting photos of Best Buys ripping out the game sections or seeing just empty shelves.
5382764	5387005	It was just like, I can't believe this is actually happening.
5387005	5390926	And I understand not everybody buys from Best Buy.
5390926	5392207	Everyone has their place, but for me,
5393174	5396817	And living in New York City, Best Buy is more convenient for me to go and do my shopping.
5396817	5399600	But for some people, it's Walmart.
5399600	5405425	And now what we're discovering is that Walmart is removing video games from their stores.
5405425	5406706	And they're starting with...
5410686	5416631	And in a way, the stories coming out, it doesn't make sense, but at the same time it does.
5416631	5421394	Supposedly, Microsoft told Walmart to remove the game.
5421394	5424536	There's been no proof that that was said.
5424536	5426058	It's just that this is what's happening.
5426678	5435266	as there was a memo that came out that talked about them removing the physical copies of the game from its platform and no longer sell it.
5435266	5440410	If you're lucky, you might be able to find a copy for three cents as it's being marked down.
5440410	5447256	Stores aren't supposed to sell it, but if you get lucky, it's your three cents worth.
5447256	5447557	Wow.
5448633	5463800	Um, it would be very well, you know, you know, who's gonna celebrate this news if you know, again, this is kind of just like one instance, but it definitely if you can't help but feel like, oh, this is the latest in a trend, but you know, who's gonna fucking celebrate this news?
5463800	5466142	You know, who's so fucking happy about this?
5466142	5466622	GameStop.
5469155	5482165	Because, I mean, as these other places that sell the physical media is going away, GameStop now and granted I and to be fair, many people, you know, many GameStops have scaled back on that too.
5482165	5487209	And we know GameStops sell a lot of other crap than just video games at this point.
5487509	5491810	becoming like NerdStop or GeekStop with all of the stuff that they're selling.
5491810	5497691	But, you know, but yeah, but GameStop kind of got done in by Walmart in some ways.
5497691	5504413	So it's interesting if Walmart does start to scale back on this because, you know, square footage inside of Walmart is valuable.
5504413	5510114	If there's other stuff they want to put in there, then, you know, phone accessories or whatever it is they're going to put in there, then so be it.
5510114	5515436	But yeah, this is definitely this is
5517046	5523128	This, I don't want to say this is the end of physical media, but it's starting to feel like shit.
5523128	5525529	This is, this is getting real.
5525529	5528230	Like physical media is dwindling.
5528230	5532871	Rob, let me tell you back in the, I think it was mid to late 2000.
5532871	5533392	I don't remember.
5533392	5543115	I used to work as a rep for Best Buy and I would go in, I would do inventory of certain titles, pack out certain movies and DVDs and so forth.
5543115	5545896	And I would go into different stores and I would just see like,
5546826	5555129	rows and columns of DVDs and Blu-rays, and when I started, it was a small section for VHS tapes.
5555129	5573656	Now, I go into a Best Buy, it's just like these short shelves, and it's like maybe four or five, and it's like the top sellers, this is what's out this week, and that's it.
5573656	5574877	And I look, and it's like,
5576223	5581705	There's nothing here that I really care about, so I'm just gonna do what everybody else does.
5581705	5584826	I will just order it off of Amazon.
5584826	5588187	Which would be the other one celebrating what's happening at Walmart, to be honest.
5588187	5590087	Well, I do know this.
5590087	5595549	They're still gonna be selling physical games online, which is where I deal with the bulk of my shopping.
5595549	5597689	I just be like, you know what?
5597689	5602651	I will just swing by this location after work, because it's along the way, pick it up, and go home.
5604531	5606492	Alright, well, let's move on to our next story.
5606492	5612597	And by the way, part of the reason I'm I'm starting to pick it up tonight show just might be cursed, Rama and I swear it's not your fault.
5612597	5616659	But here's I'm going to show this for those that are watching on the stream tonight.
5616659	5623684	I sort of point out that big cell of red rain is headed right this direction.
5623684	5629969	And I I would I wouldn't be shocked if this power just fucking goes out middle of the show.
5629969	5631870	So if that's if that ends up happening,
5634076	5637158	Well, Rob, let me tell you.
5637158	5639659	Thankfully, Twitch serves as a backup.
5639659	5641040	And so those days are over.
5641040	5644122	But it's yeah, it's one of those days, that's for sure.
5644122	5645563	Rob, let me tell you.
5645563	5658991	I mean, if the if the people who are participating with us haven't noticed my arm going behind me because I have a heater back here that I've been switching off and on because it is a nice crisp
5660180	5672846	20 degrees outside, and the insulation of this studio isn't the best in the world, which is why there is a curtain here, because I can stick my hand through the curtain and feel Frosty the Snowman give me a high five.
5672846	5673786	Oh, yikes.
5673786	5674226	All right.
5674226	5675787	Well, stay warm in there.
5675787	5686351	And Mr. Smush would love your little heat thing, by the way, because, you know, Mr. Smush's place, my cat, for those who don't know, do you know Mr. Smush's favorite place to relax?
5686351	5687092	Under the oven.
5688032	5707730	he will get into a little spot between the oven and the counter like when the oven is running mind you but it's don't worry he's fine he's a mod it's a modern oven it's contained in a thing he's wasn't safe there but he'll be because the hot air is blowing out of it he loves to curl up in a little ball right by there just get soak in that hot air that's love
5708223	5709124	He could listen to this show.
5709124	5710624	There's a lot of hot air on this show, too.
5710624	5712105	All right.
5712105	5713226	I'm just kidding.
5713226	5714526	All right.
5714526	5715207	Terrible.
5715207	5718028	Let's talk about the Microsoft Developer Direct.
5718028	5723511	They had a big little to do this week and they made some updates on some games.
5723511	5726873	Avowed is one game that has been on many people's radar.
5726873	5731315	It will be it's confirmed that it is coming to Game Pass and it is coming out this fall.
5731315	5735718	And of course, Avowed is one of those games that we kind of got a little bit of a taste of previously from Obsidian.
5736338	5738840	But it was nice to see a little bit more of that.
5738840	5742103	I'm into this, and the fact that it's on Game Pass is a huge win.
5742103	5747548	I mean, again, with everything we talked about, you know, with PAL World earlier in the show, Game Pass is the only reason.
5747548	5750851	Like, if I was going to pay $30 to check that out, I probably wouldn't have.
5750851	5752853	Game Pass is the reason why I did.
5752853	5756175	So it's nice to see The Devout is coming to Game Pass.
5756175	5762741	In fact, I think just about everything they were talking about was Game Pass related, which is very typical for Microsoft and their events.
5762741	5763261	Finally,
5763962	5766546	Senua's Saga Hellblade 2.
5766546	5767187	We have a date.
5768134	5774958	We have a date they're finally after all these teasers over all these years we finally know May 21st, which is that's pretty good.
5774958	5777120	That means it's summer not holiday.
5777120	5782823	May 21st $50 game, which kind of surprised me.
5782823	5785965	They're not going full but I don't know if it's because a little bit shorter of a game.
5785965	5790808	I think the first game was not super long, but it's only $50.
5790808	5793770	But here's the interesting twist.
5793770	5794791	It is digital only.
5796081	5798922	along the same lines of what Ranma was just saying.
5798922	5803503	This is a digital only for such a for a game that they've been hyping so fucking long.
5803503	5805143	Digital only.
5805143	5806783	See, this this is the thing.
5806783	5811765	Number one, Game Pass has saved me so much money since I've had it.
5811765	5814665	Number two, this is something I hear from people all the time.
5814665	5818926	Like, why are digital games just as expensive as physical games?
5818926	5822167	And I don't know if you know this, but years back,
5822950	5831177	Digital counterparts were a lot cheaper, but the big retailers were like, if you don't bring the prices up, we're not going to carry your games into stores.
5833666	5834487	Visions of Mana
5859008	5860809	That's pretty exciting as well.
5860809	5871638	I know the mana reboots have done... The first mana reboot was kind of eh, but then the trials of mana ended up pretty good, and I think folks are excited for this one as well.
5871638	5880185	Ara, History Untold is another game that they were teasing, which I kind of think is their answer to Civilization of sorts.
5880185	5883027	I think it's a 4X kind of game, so that could be interesting.
5883727	5885109	Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
5901743	5903724	Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
5918782	5930752	One other thing that some very eagle-eyed people were catching, uh, is that apparently the developer direct had a segment about puzzles.
5930752	5941961	And in the background, there was a quake symbol with texts that said A-K-E-6 that was written in the foreground.
5941961	5942302	Hmm.
5943820	5960430	Now, I don't know why there would be a Quake 6 before a Quake 5, but maybe, I don't know, I would think a Quake reboot in this realm of something like Doom and how that all went would be a little more likely, but who knows.
5960430	5961851	So, that is something.
5961851	5962891	Maybe they're trolling us.
5962891	5963952	Yeah.
5963952	5965072	Yeah, maybe it's just a big troll.
5965072	5966133	That could be too.
5966133	5966413	All right.
5967954	5975816	Let's talk about Tekken 8 because we'd brought up previously some issues with accessibility or actually some neat things that they are doing with accessibility.
5975816	5980617	And they're making some changes based on feedback that's already come in with that accessibility.
5980617	5987498	So folks that were testing the colorblind features were saying, Oh, we're getting vertigo and migraines.
5987498	5990759	So Tekken director, or Tekken 8 director,
5991119	6000883	Katsuhiro Harada responded and said folks have misunderstood the accessibility options, saying it weren't meant to be useful for all the colorblind players.
6000883	6006966	Well, that seems kind of like a kick in the butt, but he does clarify it was a work in progress.
6006966	6013509	We've tweaked that quite a bit to address some of the issues and make sure that it works better for a wider variety of people.
6013929	6041061	the updated versions will be added to the retail game and the demo we just don't know when but it is worth pointing out Tekken 8 comes out oh this week January the 26th so it's right around the corner so neat uh oh Rama this is uh this is uh this is the end of an era right yeah it is and i was just kind of shocked by that you know i i just never would have expected it but
6042102	6044726	As the saying goes, all good things come to an end.
6044726	6051717	And what I mean is, the very last batch of Rock Band 4 DLC comes out.
6051717	6054040	And it's going to drop on Thursday the 25th.
6055726	6065595	And this happens to follow the Harmonix launch of Fortnite Festival, which is a game similar to Rock Band, but just playable within Fortnite, which to me kind of makes sense.
6065595	6073303	If they're putting all this effort into this new game, they're going to probably need a team that was working on Rock Band to kind of get it done.
6073303	6075805	Yeah, and they charge way more for the DLC in Fortnite Festivals.
6075805	6076606	That's where the money's at.
6077918	6079340	Rob, you wanna know something?
6079340	6079440	What?
6079440	6079600	Me too.
6097589	6099490	But I don't either.
6099490	6102411	But here's the here's the in all seriousness, it is still sad.
6102411	6104792	And I know like Rock Band 4 was was good.
6104792	6109794	And, you know, there's people that, you know, miss the plastic instrument parties and all that stuff.
6109794	6113156	And PogCulture in chat says, I want Rock Band 5, damn it.
6113156	6114976	Well, guess what?
6114976	6118318	You got to make a Fortnite account if you want to play it, because that's that's it.
6118318	6119418	For better or for worse.
6119418	6120679	That's what you got now.
6120679	6123100	I remember years ago,
6123880	6126702	playing Rock Band on the Xbox 360.
6126702	6128364	It was me.
6128364	6130365	It was DarkTetsuya.
6130365	6131506	It was Misty.
6131506	6136350	I don't remember who the fourth person was, but we would just get together and just start jamming.
6136350	6138932	We just had a grand old time, you know?
6139412	6141754	And, you know, the Fortnite Festival, it's all right.
6141754	6143995	It brings the spirit, except you don't actually sing.
6143995	6146297	The singing is also keystrokes.
6146297	6148238	You know, it's similar to guitar or whatever.
6148238	6150960	But I think Fortnite Festival is fine.
6150960	6153421	You know, it got me to install Fortnite and check it out.
6153421	6156163	And they are adding new songs into Fortnite Festival.
6156163	6158365	It's slow, but they do it.
6158365	6159305	It's on Thursday.
6159305	6165369	So I think like Bastille, the... Pompeii, was that the name of the song?
6165369	6166970	I think that was the song that came out this week.
6166970	6169092	That one other song came out.
6170035	6172243	Is that song in Rock Band as well as DLC?
6173761	6176302	After all these years, I would imagine.
6176302	6189789	I'm assuming what they're doing is going back to the companies and renegotiating the licenses on the song so they can slowly move them from Rock Band to Fortnite.
6189789	6193931	It doesn't quite go one for one because many of the key patterns are four.
6193931	6196492	Unless you play on Expert, then it's five.
6196492	6200814	And then again, vocals have to be keyed because they don't play like they did in Rock Band.
6200814	6201134	But
6201575	6204242	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6208936	6212797	But it's yeah, it does feel very like end of an era.
6212797	6217618	And I get that fortnight festival is still because let's be real, like, as much as I say, it's fun.
6217618	6217998	It's cool.
6217998	6218978	I like it.
6218978	6222599	I think that they're like five, they want 500 v bucks.
6222599	6225580	It's like five bucks for one fucking song.
6225580	6233922	And then there's a battle pass and some songs like if you want Gangnam style, that's only in or you want Poison by Belle de Vivre Devoe.
6233922	6235563	What an iconic song.
6235563	6236783	You have to get the battle pass.
6237603	6242405	And to that I say, no, I won't.
6242405	6245287	So now they do have the free song rotation.
6245287	6249549	And that's kind of something that you know, rock band didn't have is that you get to rotate in that stuff.
6249549	6250509	That's kind of neat.
6250509	6255992	But yeah, it's, it's not the same as rock band.
6255992	6260254	But sadly, it's they're going to get the plastic they are working on the plastic instrument support.
6260254	6261795	So that will be interesting when they get that in.
6261795	6262255	That'll be cool.
6262657	6263598	That would be nice.
6263598	6272371	Now, maybe they can actually do another production run of that very expensive rock band adapter that's going for anywhere between $300 and $500 on Amazon.
6272371	6274815	Yes, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
6274815	6276137	Yeah, definitely.
6276607	6287689	All right, well, a lot of fans very excited to hear this because Sony is going to be making a movie out of one of their surprise hits from a few years ago, Until Dawn.
6287689	6290450	So yeah, Until Dawn, which came out in 2015.
6290450	6294311	My goodness, I didn't realize that game was hitting about nine years old as well.
6294311	6296031	It's going to be getting a movie adaptation.
6296031	6301852	David Sandberg, who made the Shazam movies and Lights Out, is going to be directing this.
6301852	6304973	The script is coming from Gary Dauberman.
6306134	6307275	Annabelle Creations
6325470	6344385	technically you can play through the game and just about everybody lives I don't want to spoil but like there's like kind of certain people that have to die but then you can also play through the game and like everybody dies so it'll be interesting to see how they kind of do that choose your own adventure for the movie I
6345126	6350208	I mean, I don't know, like I'm of a couple of mindsets because I'm like, yeah, the people are really into the story.
6350208	6351528	It's a good horror thing.
6351528	6353869	I think I think the movie will be good.
6353869	6357830	But I'm also kind of like, but the the game stands, you don't need a movie.
6357830	6358710	The game exists.
6358710	6360791	The game serves as the movie.
6360791	6362632	It's it's of a quality enough.
6362632	6364612	But, you know.
6364612	6368634	People still, you know, I guess you could say the same thing about The Last of Us and look, that TV show is
6369639	6371000	Banana's popular.
6371000	6372181	Yeah, so we'll see.
6372181	6374544	Well, I will say this.
6374544	6378387	When I was coming back from Japan, I actually watched the Gran Turismo movie.
6378387	6380770	It was a lot better than I thought it would be.
6380770	6382491	Yeah, yeah, true.
6382491	6388677	Tigerclaw on chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says maybe they'll come up with an original story that doesn't follow the game story.
6388677	6392541	That could I could see that that maybe they don't have like the same characters.
6392541	6394703	Maybe the plot is kind of similar.
6395383	6398024	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6424975	6429818	If you read about like the reasons why Clue bombed the box office, it was because of that.
6429818	6431499	It was because of the multiple endings.
6431499	6442025	It actually did so much better on cable at the time, because, you know, in the mid 80s, in reruns, most of us grew up on that movie watching it on TV because they would show it with all three endings.
6442025	6443566	And people were into that.
6443566	6449770	And you could like we were able to suspend disbelief about, OK, sure, there's just three ways this thing ended.
6449770	6452091	It's it's a silly comedy movie anyway.
6452091	6453452	So anyway.
6454451	6455612	All right.
6455612	6458073	Um, but I think it's neat.
6458073	6472462	And I think it's, you know, especially if somebody who hosts, you know, horror related things, and I know I have my own nuanced takes on the genre, but I think this is going to be very interesting to see how this translates to a movie, especially if they end up wanting to do a franchise out of it.
6472462	6477965	Does this mean they do the quarry and some of these other games, or do they try to make more stuff within the Until Dawn universe?
6477965	6483569	Because you don't make a horror franchise in this day and age, if you're not thinking about a trilogy, at least.
6484417	6484597	Bear.
6509833	6520019	Anyhow, let's talk about a pretty cool response from Nintendo to a really tragic earthquake that happened in the Noto Peninsula.
6520019	6527963	Nintendo is actually donating 50 million yen to the Japanese Red Cross, and they're also going to be doing some free repairs.
6527963	6532005	So this is a translated version of Nintendo's statement.
6532005	6537668	We would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone who is affected by the 2020 Noto Peninsula earthquake.
6537668	6538469	We will provide
6539389	6539869	Repairs
6556377	6560761	We will provide free repairs for our products requested by people in areas where the Disaster Relief Act applies in response
6581721	6585922	for a period of six months from the application of the Disaster Relief Act in each region.
6585922	6592564	In addition, we will donate 50 million yen through the Japanese Red Cross Society to support those affected by the disaster.
6592564	6600006	Regarding repair requests from areas covered by the law following the earthquake, please also see more information.
6601549	6606432	It should also be pointed out that SEGA is also doing something.
6606432	6609153	Now, obviously, there's no hardware on SEGA's end.
6609153	6609693	Sad.
6609693	6618177	But they've donated the equivalent of about $135,000 towards charity efforts in the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake.
6618177	6618778	It's right here.
6618778	6620839	So I was like, I thought that happened not that long ago.
6620839	6624721	So yeah, I think that's a mistranslation error that's happening on Twitter.
6624721	6626081	Twitter broken?
6626081	6626762	You don't say.
6628255	6629476	Shocked, I tell you.
6629476	6630577	Well, not really shocked.
6630577	6633600	By the way, can we go back to something way earlier in the show?
6633600	6634801	Can I, can I call that?
6634801	6636162	Cause, um, yes, yes.
6636162	6641426	The whole pal world stuff and the discourse around, well, the CEO said these stupid things.
6641426	6643147	So, you know, the game must have it.
6643147	6652315	I just want to remind everybody this, a majority of that discourse, cause I've seen some on blue sky, but the vast majority of that discourse about the CEO said something stupid.
6652315	6654257	Therefore we can't support it.
6654257	6655778	It's coming from Twitter.
6659011	6664776	I'm gonna just set that down, we'll walk away, and I'll let y'all think about that for a little bit.
6664776	6667638	Oh, sorry, Ranma, I was using the wrong shot, you were split in half there.
6667638	6667979	All right.
6667979	6668699	It's fine.
6668699	6677647	And as you were doing that and talking about Twitter, the theme from Curb Your Enthusiasm just popped right into my head as if it was meant to be, because it makes so much sense.
6677647	6678647	Yeah.
6678647	6679828	All right.
6679828	6685113	Anyway, moving on, let's, oh, this is, oh, so here's the thing.
6686564	6691705	People are talking about how pissed they are about AI art and how they're not going to buy games that support it.
6691705	6695286	And I totally get that, uh, depending on how the AI art was trained.
6695286	6703708	And again, if it's trained on its own shit, that's different, but it seems to be the latest fad and the latest thing we're going to, we're going to gang up on the companies.
6703708	6708109	Well, let's talk about the last thing we ganged up on the companies with Rama.
6708109	6713231	Now, before we get into that, I want to touch on something regarding the earthquake.
6713231	6714851	I remember being home.
6717081	6723904	My wristwatch, my smartwatch, vibrating like crazy at like three, four o'clock in the morning.
6723904	6726445	And I'm just like, what the hell's going on?
6726445	6728746	And I'm checking and I see messages.
6728746	6729567	Are you safe?
6729567	6730507	Are you all right?
6730507	6733288	Are you, I'm like, what the hell?
6733288	6735589	I had no idea what was going on.
6735589	6738530	I go to the computer, go on to Facebook.
6738530	6742792	Cause of course that's where you go to get your news instead of like CNN, you know, and,
6743353	6744914	And lo and behold, Earthquake.
6744914	6747215	I was like, oh.
6747215	6748396	Yeah.
6748396	6753738	And because of the algorithm half the time, people thought I was still there.
6753738	6763583	I will say one of my friends who I hung out with, she lives in Nagoya and she said she felt like the vibrations of where she was in the office, but it wasn't so bad.
6763583	6770227	So she was, I would say she was at least four hours inlet from where it was.
6770487	6781633	I feel like what was really making the news here and maybe keep in mind, maybe it's because I'm in California, were the tsunami warnings and that element of it was, I feel like making the news pretty heavy too.
6781633	6789877	Cause that's kind of like, I'm like, I thought that happened, you know, when the mistranslated tweet was throwing me, I was like, I remember hearing all of these tsunami things not that long ago.
6789877	6791458	It wasn't that the same thing.
6791458	6793299	So yeah, it's a lot of that here.
6793959	6812710	and don't forget there was like a small earthquake out in California and then right after that an earthquake kind of hit us in New York because it popped up on the news about some explosion something happened at Roosevelt Island I'm just like nothing happens on Roosevelt Island I read the next day it was an earthquake I was like you know
6814229	6815671	This next story reminds me of an old saying.
6815671	6816892	A fool and their money are soon parted.
6841650	6846393	What I'm talking about is how GameStop is terminating their NFT marketplace.
6846393	6849514	I mean, who saw that coming?
6849514	6855518	So, they're basically saying that they're phasing out the marketplace due to regulatory uncertainty.
6855518	6862742	Well, but GameStop told their users that they have over two weeks remaining to use its platform.
6863649	6873534	but yet the company assured the holders of their NFTs that the decision will not impact their NFTs, which remain accessible and saleable through other platforms.
6873534	6878977	So we're shutting it down, but you're able to- You can still show them off to all the people that don't give a shit.
6878977	6879697	Exactly.
6881872	6893576	And one of the reasons why GameStop is doing this, they cited a lack of regulation as a reason for reducing their crypto initiatives, pointing out that continued regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space.
6893576	6899338	The company's headquarters in the United States, where regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remain uncertain.
6899338	6900458	Well, I don't know.
6900458	6902479	The fact that now you can actually get...
6903519	6914178	An RTX 3000 series graphics card or 4000 series graphics card at a reasonable price where you don't have to sell an arm and a leg should tell you something.
6916244	6922188	Alright, well, let's move on to another story we have here, which is, oh boy.
6922188	6926871	So I totally forgot that this game was coming out like this soon.
6926871	6929393	And I know like Bobby Blackwolf is going to beat me up for saying that.
6929393	6930173	But it's true.
6930173	6932615	Like I, I've seen this game obviously teased.
6932615	6936998	I like thought this game was like a holiday holiday 20 day 2024 game.
6936998	6939540	No, like a dragon, infinite wealth.
6940140	6941641	to the sequel to that game.
6941641	6946004	I unfortunately did not finish because I get easily distracted by shiny things.
6946004	6948046	But YouTube, well, you know, it happens.
6948046	6948967	But here's the thing.
6948967	6950628	I still am taking an interest in the sequel.
6950628	6955011	I'm sure the sequel story is completely followable, whether I beat the original game or not.
6955011	6957473	That's the sequel is coming this week.
6957473	6958594	It's coming out.
6958594	6963898	And to build hype for the game, they got XQC to stream the game.
6965356	6984726	Here's the thing, I'm not gonna hate on the guy just because he's popular, because there's plenty of other reasons, but I'm just gonna say, I don't know why they teamed up with him, well they teamed up with him because he has all of these followers, he has, you know, all these people on, you know, the green site, and does he stream here too?
6984726	6985386	I feel like he does.
6986887	7003648	but I think here's the thing he doesn't really care for role playing games and he's kind of like said that that he doesn't like and he's playing the game and when the game goes turn battle which by the way like a dragon as the mainline series is now the
7004369	7007613	Dragon Quest parody if you will that is now the main series.
7007613	7014360	So it's that it's not that more actiony old Yakuza game, but I have a fucking feeling xQc wouldn't know the goddamn difference anyway.
7014360	7017243	And the reality is because this is not his bread and butter.
7017243	7019566	So I just find it very strange.
7021038	7026382	that these folks didn't do a little more research on exactly what streamers were going to be doing this.
7026382	7029104	And they just put it in front of the most popular one.
7029104	7035509	And I kind of feel like that is, that's a dangerous slope because you know, when he's sitting there going, well, I don't know what this is.
7035509	7035929	What's it going?
7035929	7036249	Yes.
7036249	7037590	It just looks silly.
7037590	7045836	And there's plenty of popular streamers who do play RPGs who are into this, who would, you know, probably love to play this to be quite honest.
7045836	7047378	So it's just, I don't know.
7047378	7050440	It's, it's not, not a great marketing choice to be quite honest.
7050700	7054163	And I'm trying not to be a hater, but I have no choice.
7054163	7055223	No, no, you're right.
7055223	7066252	But maybe they're trying to tap into expanding the market, getting people who play those types of shooters or whatever to check out something new, get them out of his own comfort zone.
7066252	7067873	That's what I'm thinking.
7067873	7079261	And to be perfectly honest, the only time I've heard of XQC is the one time Linus from Linus Tech Tips went to his house to help rebuild his computer that he broke trying to build himself.
7079261	7080182	That was it.
7083490	7088994	Anyway, yeah, TigerClaw in chat says they just look at who the most popular streamer is, and that's the name that pops up.
7088994	7090335	Yep.
7090335	7106225	Now, QuestBuster does point out kind of one of the like bummers about this game is that this was pure marketing, just like the decision to lock New Game Plus behind the more expensive deluxe and ultimate editions of the game, which again, talk about choices like.
7106225	7111349	I'm sure the game is going to be fine, but I really wish companies would stop making choices
7112554	7114315	to fuck everything up.
7114315	7124739	Because there's a lot of hard work that goes into these things and we don't need these choices to fuck everything up.
7124739	7127600	It'll be on Game Pass eventually anyway, if you're willing to wait.
7127600	7135043	But you know, again, I think the Yakuza and Like a Dragon fans would, you know, appreciate me saying, still check it out when it comes out.
7135043	7138004	But you know, these are the things we have to weigh.
7138004	7138244	Anyway.
7139761	7141762	All right, well, the game does come out this week.
7141762	7153691	So maybe a streamer that you like and appreciate will be streaming the game as opposed to somebody that's just popular and then you can come to your own conclusions about this game and if it is for you.
7153691	7160936	All right, we're gonna move on ahead since we already did the classic game of the week earlier in the show before DarkSakura went on her way.
7160936	7164318	And I wonder if she's able to sleep with this pissing down rain outside.
7164318	7166840	I know it doesn't pick up on my microphone with the noise gate, but it's
7167850	7168791	It's coming down.
7168791	7170211	So I mean, keep it.
7170211	7171872	It's West Coast coming down.
7171872	7172973	There is a difference.
7172973	7173273	Okay.
7173273	7176755	When you live on this side of the Rockies, it's a different atmosphere.
7176755	7181697	It's different, but it's, it's, it's California rain coming down right now.
7181697	7182898	So it's pretty, pretty well.
7182898	7184339	Oh, DarkSakura's in chat still.
7184339	7185679	It says, Rob, I love rain.
7185679	7186880	I sleep better with hard rain.
7186880	7188181	Get off your phone.
7188181	7191883	Go to bed.
7191883	7193043	Sometimes when I'm streaming.
7193043	7194324	You know what doesn't help you sleep?
7194324	7195965	Playing on your phone or your computer.
7198976	7208764	Rob, listen, when I stream sometimes and the kids are screaming and yelling, I'm just like praying to the streaming gods that when I go back and do the edits, it is not heard.
7208764	7211366	And 99% of the time it's not.
7211366	7215569	And then for some reason, the neighbor's dog starts barking.
7215569	7218452	I'm just like.
7218452	7219713	All right.
7219713	7224636	We have another few stories we want to touch on pretty quickly here, just some rapid fire headlines.
7224636	7226338	So Rama, we'll go over to you.
7227571	7230954	We're gonna talk about this game called Groove Coaster.
7230954	7237619	It seems that the game, Groove Coaster 4 Max, is going offline in April.
7237619	7245146	It seems that Taito announced that this is going to happen effective April 1st, 2020.
7245146	7248429	Is this a long-awaited April Fool's joke, Taito?
7248429	7251151	Please let me know now, that way we're all in on the joke.
7252418	7254841	But according to them, they're going to shut the game down.
7254841	7256783	Is April Fool's a thing in Japan?
7256783	7260146	I don't think it is as much.
7260146	7260566	Probably.
7260566	7262348	I mean, they're on the Internet like everybody else.
7262348	7264470	So I think you have to kind of come across it there.
7264470	7265852	But yeah.
7265852	7266132	Yeah.
7266132	7270617	Some Japanese companies have kind of done jokes as well.
7270617	7271618	So who knows?
7271618	7271898	Yeah.
7271898	7275702	But it's it's still announced in January, so it doesn't look not good.
7277042	7281704	Yeah, so it's shutting down April 1st, 2024, 6 a.m.
7281704	7283746	Japanese Standard Time.
7283746	7291730	The Rhythm Arcade game itself will be available after the date as long as the Arcade Center still retains its cabinet, so you have that.
7292450	7299034	Once the game goes offline, you're not going to be able to record any play data with your Nesica card here.
7299034	7304697	But what's going to happen is the extra mode and the difficulty levels for each songs will be all unlocked.
7304697	7310721	So there's no online connection, but everything that's in the game will be available for you to play.
7310721	7317505	And it will also be local versus mode if there are multiple cabinets there running the game, which is kind of cool.
7320002	7322744	Well, let's talk a little bit about awesome games done quick.
7322744	7329929	And if you were here earlier in the evening here at VOG Network, you heard Bobby Blackwolf talk a lot about this because he's involved with hosting.
7329929	7336893	In fact, ironically, talking about Yakuza and Like a Dragon, that's kind of one of the, you know, Froob is the speedrunner and is the real star of that.
7336893	7343798	But Bobby has definitely become like the voice off screen that helps, you know, kind of narrate through that whole thing.
7343798	7344959	And it's a lot of fun to watch.
7345379	7347401	Thanks for watching!
7347401	7348262	Like, share and subscribe!
7363897	7370683	Um, but from a technical perspective, it sounds like because they were doing like an A stage and a B stage this year, they had very little delays.
7370683	7371324	They were getting through it.
7371324	7372965	They had like extra speed runs.
7372965	7385697	So it was a, it was a well-oiled machine and that well-oiled machine raised two and a half million dollars raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, to which we give a hearty fuck cancer.
7385697	7388659	This is a great charity to be raising money for.
7388659	7390101	So that's amazing.
7391360	7394524	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7408979	7413340	any god raising $10,000 for a charity is fucking impressive.
7413340	7415201	You get up to a number like 2.5 million.
7415201	7416221	That's mind blowing.
7416221	7421943	So I don't think any, anyone over there should be comparing to these other years where the economy was different.
7421943	7423043	The environment was different.
7423043	7427064	People were consuming more Twitch content because the pandemic yada, yada, yada.
7427064	7428905	Um, I think that's an amazing number.
7428905	7433726	And they did, they did this like, of course the dog running gyromite.
7433726	7435286	That's cool.
7435286	7436167	Yeah.
7436167	7436487	Button.
7437627	7441308	That's, that's, you know, that's, that's infamous right there.
7441308	7443489	So that's, that's great.
7443489	7447450	That dog is the bestest boy on this planet.
7447450	7449190	And then what was the other meme that came out of that?
7449190	7451631	Hooray.
7451631	7453572	That's the other thing I'm hearing a lot of.
7453572	7453812	All right.
7456351	7460136	Unfortunately, I also for that good news, I have some not so good news.
7460136	7463821	And that is current layoff updates in the industry.
7463821	7466424	I hate that this is becoming a regular segment.
7466424	7474354	But now we have actually a studio we talked about a lot on this show behavior, the creators of Dead by Daylight have confirmed they have laid off
7474854	7477795	Less than 3% of the total workforce.
7477795	7479095	I mean, it still sucks though.
7479095	7482556	If you're one of that 3%, you know, you're not happy.
7482556	7492178	They're blaming it on changing market conditions, saying, quote, recently changing market conditions necessitated adjusting the scope of several behavior projects.
7492178	7496499	In these situations, our preference is always to reassign talent to other projects.
7496499	7499040	Unfortunately, this option is not always available to us.
7499040	7502561	These departures represented less than 3% of our total workforce.
7503866	7509271	I feel like something got cancelled behind the scenes.
7509271	7512093	I don't think this has a goddamn thing to do with Dead by Daylight.
7512093	7516037	Don't forget that Behaviour does other stuff too, like the dating sim.
7516037	7519519	But also Meet Your Maker was a game they released last year.
7519519	7523103	I think the fact that you probably forgot about that until I just mentioned it.
7523743	7527705	Unfortunately says a bit about the state of that game and so forth.
7527705	7535169	So yeah, I think it's probably just other projects we didn't know about or maybe some things related to meet your maker.
7535169	7535670	Who knows?
7535670	7537571	But yeah, that is a bummer.
7537571	7539512	Our thoughts to those affected.
7539512	7542894	Also, with some more cuts at Embracer.
7544633	7547776	Lost Boys Interactive confirmed the news saying
7567009	7569090	Headwinds facing the industry right now.
7569090	7574712	Unfortunately, this does mean we will separate from some of our team members, and we're working closely with those affected.
7574712	7581334	We know this is a hard time for this talented and experienced group of people, and we'll provide support and assistance through this transition to those leaving.
7583180	7587562	again, I'm going to say I'm going to say this a lot this year, and I'm sorry in advance for being a broken record.
7587562	7594424	But I hope those affected can find that silver lining of the fact that video games are art.
7594424	7597025	And there's nothing stopping you from making art.
7597025	7598586	And that is how some great
7599006	7599647	IndieGames
7614645	7626228	Those that have the ability to band together and do that, I hope people are able to make diamonds out of this lump of coal news and the gaming industry as a result certainly wins as well.
7626228	7629129	By the way, some other comments coming in from our chat.
7629129	7636251	Questbuster saying there are rumors that Piranha Bytes, an RPG dev known for their Gothic series, is allegedly threatened with closure.
7636251	7637592	That's a part of Embracer.
7638432	7641054	SSJ100 Matt saying there's so many layoffs in tech right now.
7641054	7642935	It just feels like it's never going to stop.
7642935	7645076	Google said they're going to have layoffs soon as well.
7645076	7648658	This is just, it's, it's scary.
7648658	7651860	And it's, do we blame AI?
7651860	7655803	I feel like there's more than just the AI thing going on here.
7655803	7661006	I can tell you this right now, because the company I work for, this happened to us last year.
7661006	7662046	What happened was,
7663067	7670271	I think it was the middle of 2022, they hired an efficiency company to see how things work and operate and so forth.
7670271	7682939	And after everything was said and done in January, one of my co-workers who just came back from vacation was laid off and they gave him $5,000 in like compensation, whatever, and sent him on his way.
7682939	7685781	And what they didn't realize is this office
7687571	7691975	Two on-site techs, the workload has been outlandish.
7691975	7699463	We are getting stuff from the LA office that they need done, like inventory, and we're like, we'll get to it when we can.
7699463	7704948	There have been times I have stayed late just to catch up for that work or whatever, and now we're being told that
7705649	7707832	We're going to bring a third person in.
7707832	7716922	Honestly, these layoffs are coming from companies who are hiring these people to say, well, you have five people doing this role.
7716922	7717843	You don't need five.
7717843	7718744	You need four.
7718744	7721667	And then fifth person gets let go and go somewhere else.
7721667	7725952	And then you realize somewhere down the line, oh, we really need that fifth person after all.
7726656	7734420	I wonder if some of this is pandemic related as well, perhaps that, you know, because like tech really changed during the pandemic and things really grew.
7734420	7745206	And a lot of that tech is never going away, but you do see a lot of companies and a lot of society going back to normal, using my quotey fingers at this point, you know, the world will never be, but never be normal again.
7745206	7752490	But for the most part, you know, you've got a lot of people that are going back to the office, not everybody, the place I work, I'm still very thankful is telework.
7753150	7754752	I have to agree with that.
7769211	7778397	During the pandemic, Microsoft closed all of their stores except for five locations, and those are their experience centers.
7778397	7785601	All the people that used to work in those stores, they were sent to work remotely to do support and so forth.
7785601	7790364	As the trends changed and people started going back to work, they started letting those people go.
7790364	7797408	A friend of mine, a former manager at Microsoft, was one of those people, and it took him about six months to find a brand new job.
7799025	7804728	and he, let's just say he had to go through AI with his resume to make it look good enough for them to take a look and be like, you know what?
7804728	7805948	We like you, you're hired.
7805948	7807969	Wow.
7807969	7809610	AI to get by AI.
7809610	7811110	God, what is this world that we do?
7811110	7811470	All right.
7811470	7815472	Anyway, I feel like such an old man sometimes, but just... Get off my lawn!
7815472	7816433	I know, right?
7816433	7817913	All right.
7817913	7823776	Whatever happened to applying for... It's like, you know, when my parents were like, why don't you look in the paper to find a job?
7823776	7825817	Go open the paper and see who's hiring.
7828083	7832447	The paper is now indeed Craigslist and all this other stuff.
7832447	7838173	Every job I've had in my adult life since my very first one out of college, essentially ish.
7838173	7843598	I'm not going to get my whole history, but I found on LinkedIn.
7843598	7851486	When it comes to jobs, I consider myself very lucky because I'm in a field of work where if I were to get laid off today, I'd find something within 30 days.
7854454	7856915	Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't ever want that to happen.
7856915	7860456	But I do feel like if shit happened, I'm like, I have a pretty unique skill set.
7860456	7862096	I probably have to take a cut and pay.
7862096	7866657	But I feel like I have a unique skill set that I could find somewhere else.
7866657	7868238	But I just I really don't want that to happen.
7868238	7870278	So let's let's stop talking about it.
7870278	7871899	Okay, agreed, agreed, agreed.
7872259	7878447	All right, let's let's talk about something a little happier and travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out soon.
7878447	7881631	Now, Rama, I apologize because Loki kind of just knows the link.
7881631	7883213	So the one I gave you is like old.
7883213	7886236	Do you do you have the current link or do you need some help here with U.S.
7886236	7886657	releases?
7891861	7894083	Rob's getting in a boat and going around the fucking world.
7894083	7895004	Here we go.
7895004	7896485	Coming out in the U.S.
7896485	7902028	this week, in January 23rd, I believe, we have for Windows, Graven.
7902028	7905030	For the PlayStation 5 and Series X, we have Howl.
7905030	7909033	And on the Nintendo Switch, we have Neptunia, Sisters vs. Sisters.
7909033	7914097	And then on the 26th, we have Macross Shooting Insight for Windows Switch PlayStation.
7914577	7919122	We have She-Ra and the Wanderer, the Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island on the Switch.
7919122	7922205	We have Tu-Hu Luna Nights on PlayStation.
7922205	7926750	We have Under Night in Birth 2 for Windows, Switch, and PlayStation.
7926750	7930154	And then kind of the big releases for this week are on the 26th.
7930154	7934078	We've talked about them both already, but if you forgot, that's Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth.
7934418	7934959	and Tekken 8.
7954229	7956810	Sudama Relation Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy
7971634	7972895	Yuki Yuna Wayusha de Aru
8000834	8002235	Shiren the Wanderer, Tenka,
8016522	8021705	Toitsu is also out as well, because Tekken's not on the Switch.
8021705	8027047	Yggdra Union 3-in-1 Special Bundle is also out on Japan this week.
8027047	8033050	And then going to the PlayStation 5 this week and looking at the releases there, of course Tekken 8.
8033050	8037192	You also have Aliens Dark Descent getting its release in Japan this week.
8037532	8044538	If you're into Agatha Christie games, Agatha Christie Murder on the Orient Express gets a Japanese release on PlayStation 5 this week.
8044538	8048982	So that's about it for Japanese releases.
8048982	8050743	Let's take a look at the UK.
8053789	8057870	which I'm not sure this site is going to work for me.
8057870	8063572	So I may have to beg apologies to our UK fans that I'm not seeing.
8063572	8065192	I'm not seeing anything either.
8065192	8065732	I know.
8065732	8073174	I think it's the same thing where DarkSakura just kind of has a site that she uses, but I'm looking real quick to just see if maybe it's like a browser thing.
8073174	8074234	I don't hear.
8074234	8075015	No, it is.
8075015	8076715	I pulled it up in Edge and it works.
8076715	8077415	How about that?
8077415	8078416	Oh, sweet.
8078416	8078736	Yeah.
8078736	8079956	So coming out in Europe,
8081181	8085484	on the 25th of January, Yu-Gi-Oh two player starter set.
8085484	8086445	Oh, those are cards.
8086445	8087806	Why is that on this list?
8087806	8091329	Nevermind, those are cards.
8091329	8093550	This is what happens when I'm all by myself.
8093550	8095912	Well, not by myself, but you know.
8095912	8101256	But the big releases, of course, the same shit I've already talked about, Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth, and Tekkade, you knew that.
8101256	8106880	But also, The Walking Dead Destinies is out on the Switch in Europe this week.
8106880	8107701	So check that out.
8109147	8113630	Alright, phew, that was a one man around the world trip.
8113630	8115331	How about that?
8115331	8129962	Rob, before we continue this, one of the games that you mentioned, Macross Shooting Insight, when this game was announced, there was drama regarding this game because of the US licensing of Macross.
8131647	8132268	Really?
8132268	8134169	Tell me more.
8134169	8136772	One of the characters in the U.S.
8136772	8142336	version is missing from the Japanese version on the cover box, and that's Lin Min Mei.
8142336	8145960	And from my understanding it's because of
8147622	8152986	Harmony Gold's hand-fisted rights on Robotech.
8152986	8159191	Basically, Robotech is a combination of Macross, and Mostipiata, and a couple of other titles that was mixed together.
8159191	8163174	It's just all, it's because of the licensing, and in recent years,
8164212	8170440	They've come to the table and be like, we're finally going to release Original Macross in the US.
8170440	8172542	It's subtitled, but it's something.
8172542	8179571	But because of all of this, that one character is not on the cover box of the American release of the game.
8179571	8180251	Interesting.
8183284	8184645	I'm reminded of like a Ms.
8184645	8195174	Pac-Man thing where it's missing from all these collections because somebody different technically has the, but then, but then they will release it as its own thing and it's, it's weird.
8195174	8199498	Anyway, it's like, it's like the Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
8199498	8206423	Some characters couldn't be in it because the licensing in the US, but they threw in some extra characters just to kind of make up for it.
8206423	8207064	Yeah.
8207064	8207364	Wild.
8208525	8209125	All right.
8209125	8213788	Well, this is the part of the show where we want to invite your participation with us.
8213788	8216950	It's the listener roundtable, and we invite your emails every week.

8231457	8234399	Well, not just got back, but we can do all of that.
8234659	8236420	We actually do have an email tonight though.
8236420	8238781	So I will go ahead and take that away.
8238781	8245405	So again, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send an email.

8252629	8253510	And you'll see why in a minute.
8254363	8256425	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8269839	8276866	After last year's, I realized I actually enjoy having streams on, even if it's just background viewing.
8276866	8281691	But I had a hard time finding any streamers I liked post-GDQ.
8281691	8286897	A lot of the top channels on Twitch seemed, for lack of a better word, juvenile.
8286897	8288418	It's not just you.
8288418	8291762	So I would like to try again and find new favorite streamers.
8291762	8292783	Do you have any tips?
8293595	8302721	My partner likes to have SimStreamer Little Simsion and I enjoy it too, but I think I'm more into the sorts of games featured on AGDQ.
8302721	8308285	And to head off the obvious answers, I just subscribe to all of the OLR hosts' Twitch and YouTube channels.
8309045	8309685	Well, thank you for that.
8309685	8310185	Nice.
8310185	8312606	Thanks, Elliot B. Well, thank you for that.
8312606	8315046	I have a few suggestions for you, actually.
8315046	8330289	Number one, I don't know if you know, but the Games Done Quick stream, if that's the sort of thing you actually enjoy watching, they do content all year round because they you know, those those events that they do, the Awesome Games Done Quick, the Summer Games Done Quick, those are the tent poles essentially.
8330289	8333349	But they will do like pretty much every night.
8333349	8337410	I see them live doing something on their stream and
8338050	8346154	Yeah, that's, you know, kind of how they raise money in part to put the events on through bits and subs and things like that, and kind of keep that community going and you'll bring the speed running folks together.
8346154	8349615	So I'm imagining you're already following the channel.
8349615	8355478	And I think if you know, as far as like background noise goes, I think that's a really good thing to put on.
8357319	8368011	And actually, ZenMonkey11 kind of goes the direction I would actually recommend as well, who says, don't look for streamers you like, look for streams on hobbies and topics you like.
8368011	8374058	And you asked for tips, and that would be my tip to you, is go into and look for games you kind of want to watch, right?
8374458	8379021	Like, you know, it's no secret with DarkSakura doing her Dead by Daylight streaming.
8379021	8379901	I've played the game a little bit.
8379901	8382222	I like to watch Dead by Daylight streams.
8382222	8391007	The reason why I like that particular game is that the game cycle resets every 20-30 minutes, basically, because you're going into a new game, right?
8391007	8396110	Same thing with something like Overwatch or those games, because I don't feel like I'm missing anything.
8396110	8400412	Whereas when I'm watching a narrative game, and I have watched those streams, especially when my friends stream them,
8401533	8404754	I feel like it's a little bit harder to like catch a game midway.
8404754	8405674	You know what I mean?
8405674	8408094	I want to see things, you know, I think from the beginning.
8408094	8410535	So there's that.
8410535	8413675	Bobby wanted to also give you the tip through our chat room.
8413675	8420356	If you like someone on GDQ, they show their Twitch handle in the GDQ layout so you can find them.
8420356	8424837	And that's also another good point is that if there were some personalities and people you liked, follow them.
8424837	8429038	They would appreciate it because there's streamers of all sizes.
8429778	8432740	that stream in Games Done Quick.
8432740	8437383	Like, for example, Bobby Blackwolf is a mid-sized streamer.
8437383	8438964	You know what we do here at VOG Network.
8438964	8440125	We do a lot of good stuff.
8440125	8445848	He's, you know, he's not like the small, small streamer, but he's middle road, we'll say.
8445848	8450771	But there's a lot of large streamers that also participate with GDQ.
8450771	8458196	For example, I know one that I've been able to meet in person and, you know, is Enigma, Eternal Enigma, who was at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.
8458556	8487636	great guy super nice guy and I've been in his Twitch channel and he's got hundreds of people popping off at different horror games he's very well received and popular and for good reason he's very animated and has like the soundboard and all that stuff that pops up and he's very he's a very good host I in fact I believe he's done the live hosting thing kind of thing like I have and I it's like I see you bro I see you like you you've got it like I see what you're doing there so you know but my point is with that is that you know especially with an event like Games Done Quick people kind of
8488416	8491419	They have to check their egos at the door because it's for charity.
8491419	8496063	So I think there's certain people that would never do Games Done Quick because they have to check their egos at the door.
8496063	8497584	And I'll leave it at that.
8497584	8504130	But the people that do Games Done Quick, you know, they're of a certain cloth where they're willing to, like, kind of like put that stuff aside.
8504130	8504930	You know what I mean?
8504930	8505090	So
8505931	8513534	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is, of course, shouting out his pal Froob, who did the Yakuza and Like a Dragon speedrun, and pretty much anything related to that, you've probably seen Froob on.
8513534	8524758	And yeah, Froob seems like a great... I don't know him as well as Bobby does, but just from, you know, again, having it on in the background and picking things up seems like a delight, for sure.
8524758	8526299	So it's great.
8526299	8528640	I would also say... Yeah, please.
8529500	8544077	I would also say, you know, maybe this will help, like, if you have any favorite video games you've played in the past, go on Twitch and see if anybody's playing them, you know, if you know the game pretty well, have it in the background and just hear them go through the game and see if they enjoy it, or...
8545916	8550761	See if there's any voice actors that are doing Twitch streams.
8550761	8556266	One of my friends, Michelle Knotts, she did a complete Twitch stream.
8556266	8559550	I forget how long it took, but she went through Persona 5.
8559550	8563994	She created her own voices for all the characters in the game.
8565390	8581656	he fell deep into the lore and just got emotional and attached to it so there'll be parts of that stream where you will be watching but there'll be parts of the stream where you'll be doing other things as background noise as she's doing the voices for all of the the text stuff which is kind of cool yeah
8583257	8586059	Tigerclaw is recommending a Twitch channel called Classic Tetris.
8586059	8587299	That's fun.
8587299	8590962	Questbuster points out part of the challenge is finding streamers that fit your time slot.
8590962	8596706	Some really good streamers cast at very odd hours because of their locale, making them hard to see depending on when you search.
8596706	8597366	Yeah.
8597366	8601369	I would also really encourage you to narrow down your search a little bit.
8601369	8602270	Use keywords.
8603248	8608650	If there are certain types of streams you're looking for, use keywords, because I do this a lot.
8608650	8613991	Because I'm interested in supporting other LGBTQIA plus streamers, so I look for those tags a lot.
8613991	8618092	I'm not exclusive on that, but I usually find, yeah, I'm going to connect with a streamer.
8618092	8622053	We're going to have something right away in common if they have that.
8622053	8630996	But I also like people that will put chill stream, relaxed stream, or even if I'm in that particular mood and maybe you want it as background noise,
8632196	8636377	Asmr, which isn't always literally somebody doing ASMR.
8636377	8640558	But it might be somebody that's playing a game just a little more chill tonight.
8640558	8642459	You know, tonight we're just gonna vibe out.
8642459	8644879	We're gonna play a little bit of No Man's Sky.
8644879	8649360	I've just had an edible and we're gonna take on the latest expedition going on in this game.
8649360	8654102	So why don't y'all just join me in chat and you know, we'll play along.
8654102	8657302	That's sometimes what those are.
8657302	8659363	Rob, I have a request.
8659363	8659723	Yeah, what?
8660728	8665430	Can you say, the last Metroid is in captivity, the galaxy is at peace?
8665430	8667431	Of course.
8667431	8669833	The last Metroid is in captivity.
8669833	8674735	The galaxy is at peace.
8674735	8676216	Did that do something for you, Ranma?
8676216	8677556	You okay?
8677556	8686581	Here's the thing, when I heard you doing the ASMR voice, my mind switched to that line from Super Metroid, because it reminded me so much of it.
8686581	8688162	So I needed to hear that!
8690322	8691482	DarkSakura
8706308	8708489	DarkStarSakura says, I still want Rob to voice Nia for my DbD project.
8737373	8750287	The algorithm on Twitch will learn what you watch and recommend streams to you and it's worth paying attention to sometimes.
8756654	8761122	Yeah, I hope that's given you some ideas as far as like other names.
8761122	8764007	Well, of course, I would recommend Anime Jam Session.
8764007	8767252	I don't think, Ranma, you stream really on your personal stream, right?
8768064	8771447	No, I don't actually, personally, I don't use it for streaming at all.
8771447	8782856	Everything I do is through Anime Jam Session, and I just keep forgetting to find a time where I just want to do like a chill anime game stream, you know, classic Super Famicom game, just playing through and just having a good time.
8782856	8786159	I just gotta actually find, like, a time where I can actually do it, so...
8787288	8790990	I'm just looking at my list of who's streaming right now.
8790990	8792971	Hazlands is a delight.
8792971	8793872	He's playing Dead by Daylight.
8793872	8796753	He's a big DVD streamer, but he's really nice.
8796753	8798274	Leesh Kapish, she's a lot of fun.
8798274	8799755	She's got a huge community.
8799755	8801916	She's playing that Power World game right now.
8801916	8807639	LapinOnline is just... A lot of people I follow, I met at TwitchCon.
8808999	8810820	NickNPrince, Dead by Daylight Streamer
8827304	8835826	Girls Gone Wild went over to Warcraft, I can't, I'm sorry, I forget the name of the Twitch channel, I'm sorry, but I think it's Warcraft Radio, so they do stuff with that.
8835826	8839107	They have their own Twitch as well, actually.
8839107	8847448	Girls Gone Wild has a Twitch, and of course I'm still gonna support them, even if they've gone a different direction, I totally understand why, and I think it's, they're still going!
8847448	8848689	That's great!
8848689	8852510	They've been going as long as Anime Jam Session has about, I think.
8852510	8853830	They've been going a long time.
8853830	8854190	So yeah.
8854790	8858171	So yeah, just giving you some ideas, some things to consider.
8858171	8875117	And yeah, yeah, SSG100 Matt says a lot of people I follow are friends of friends, pay attention to the shout outs, pay attention to the people that in chat are bringing good vibes and are really funny or bring something to the table or like somebody whose comments are on point.
8875117	8882980	And oftentimes, if you click on their name and see a custom avatar, or you can just go to their page and see if they have followers, it'll tell you if they stream or not.
8883220	8886103	Because if they only have one follower, they probably don't stream.
8886103	8890586	I mean, it's a dangerous assumption to make because some people are just really trying to make it.
8890586	8896692	But usually somebody's, you know, gotten at least like 10, 12 people if they've done a couple streams.
8896692	8898473	And yeah, you can kind of tell that way.
8898473	8901516	So anyway, just some ideas.
8901516	8902657	I hope we gave you something to think about.
8902657	8905720	But yeah, keywords, they go a long way.
8905720	8906020	It helps.
8907441	8908602	All right.
8908602	8910924	Well, that was it for the email.
8910924	8912586	And I don't see any calls.
8912586	8913707	And that's all right.
8913707	8916269	So let's see.
8916269	8920493	Oh, Quest Buster in chat says on voice stuff, check out the modding community.
8920493	8925558	Fallout 4 is finally getting a massive mod release this year and it has a ton of voice acted roles.
8925558	8927881	Projects are always looking for roles.
8927881	8929442	Yes, that is.
8929442	8931744	That is another yeah, fan mods and things like that.
8931744	8932265	Absolutely.
8933522	8944487	I remember years ago, like, I think when Final Fantasy IV The After Years came out, there was a project behind that to do, um, like, like a, like a radio play for that.
8944487	8947388	So I knew a couple of people that were connected to that.
8947388	8948809	All right.
8948809	8951170	Well, that brings us towards the end of the show.
8951170	8952011	Oh, please.
8952011	8952831	Wait, wait.
8952831	8961395	One thing, I'm surprised this wasn't on, on the show roll, but I want to bring this up about Ubisoft, uh, screwing the pooch.
8962438	8965239	Yeah, talk about this a little bit.
8965239	8978342	Well, basically, what's been happening is, I think the CEO basically said in an interview or something like that, telling fans to get used to not owning your video games.
8978342	8980903	Yes, yes, this has been a meme all week.
8982328	8990413	And the funny thing is, I have been seeing people get upset about this and be like, I hold a physical copy of the game, I don't know what you're talking about.
8990413	9000038	And I have said, um, my brother in Christ, my sister in Christ, for the last 10 to 15 years, you do not own the video games that you purchased.
9000038	9003020	You own a license to play that game.
9003020	9006682	And the publishers can revoke that at any time as they wish.
9007222	9009403	But I have a physical copy of the game.
9009403	9012485	Physical copy of the game, so it has to call home to make sure you can play it.
9012485	9014026	And they don't want you to play it.
9014026	9017269	They can do that.
9017269	9018629	How do you know this is true?
9018629	9021471	Oh, you need to read the end user license agreement.
9021471	9022872	I never agreed to that.
9022872	9023673	Yes, you did.
9023673	9028476	You have to check that you agree to it in order to install the game on your PC.
9028476	9028756	Gotcha.
9033312	9039075	This isn't the same meme that I saw the first time, but this was something that definitely had me thinking.
9039075	9043116	This isn't the same, but it still gets the same point across.
9043116	9050779	And the meme goes like this, if paying for games means you don't own them, then pirating games isn't stealing.
9050779	9051820	Food for thought.
9051820	9054381	I had a discussion about that.
9054381	9057062	I have gone on record regarding that.
9057769	9061531	I admit at one time I have pirated games and movies.
9061531	9075338	I bootlegged this all of that when it comes to fansubs There's like a general rule of when the series is licensed you drop it and you go to something else It was considered a gray market, but the licensors were like no still bootleg.
9075338	9084883	You can't do it, and that's what was happening I mean when Fullmetal Alchemist was being released here multiple fansubbing groups passed it like a hot potato, but now
9086010	9091672	It's basically where you have a license to play this game or watch this content.
9091672	9092313	And that's it.
9092313	9094994	That's the way it's been for the last 10, 15 years.
9094994	9096434	It's in the license agreement.
9096434	9103597	You can't say you didn't agree to it because you had to in order to access what you wanted.
9103597	9105858	And this is where it's going.
9105858	9106659	This is the future.
9106659	9107579	This is how it's going to be.
9109262	9110923	And I see what's going to happen.
9110923	9114546	Like, look at some of the MMOs that are no longer around.
9114546	9116488	That's a prime example.
9116488	9123413	You can't play that MMO anymore because the servers are gone and your physical copy is just sitting on your shelf collecting dust.
9124767	9145124	It is, I do agree with you, but it is interesting what fans will do because just last week we had that story on City of Heroes, uh, which, you know, faded years ago is somewhat making a comeback through a fan community that essentially it's, it's embraced by the original developers, you know, and that sort of thing is that City of Heroes is essentially going to live on in that way.
9145124	9149008	So it is, it is interesting what fans will do to save games like that.
9150541	9155527	I mean, I think you've brought up a couple times there are private WoW servers for similar issues.
9155527	9157570	Yeah, but Blizzard don't like those.
9157570	9160394	But because of those, we have WoW Classic.
9160394	9164679	That is something to consider, is that Blizzard kind of responded to it in their own way.
9165691	9167753	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9185523	9188285	But anyway, no, I mean like, and you know, I also, I want to be clear.
9188285	9190546	I don't advocate for piracy either.
9190546	9199232	You know, there was a time in my life, and even you can go back on this show where I was, because I would get so frustrated at games that did not release in the U.S.
9199232	9205076	And I was like, if they're not going to release the game here for me to purchase it, then I'm going to download it and just take it because they don't want me to buy it.
9205076	9206097	That's what that says.
9206097	9214142	I realize, you know, especially I'm older and more mature now, I realize there's complicated licensing agreements that they can't sometimes release music games and other reasons for that reason.
9214142	9215203	But, you know, I'm,
9216745	9217326	What can I say?
9217326	9218948	I'm still very stubborn in that way.
9218948	9225298	But this whole concept of there's games that are only released in certain territories, a lot of that's faded.
9225298	9230045	It's over the years as you know, digital has made it more of a global marketplace for sure.
9231221	9250061	and you're right and i'll go on record and say at the time i pirated bootleg because i wanted it and i couldn't afford it half the time if i played it i'm like you know what i'm going to buy this and i'm going to support it and with the advent of streaming anime being able to watch some of my series i started hitting the delete button on titles i
9250942	9252002	that I downloaded.
9252002	9255443	When I started buying stuff, I was able to do that as well.
9255443	9264746	And then, as I continued to go to conventions and meet voice actors and people in the industry, the views on piracy just changed.
9264746	9278311	And my thing is this, I don't condone it, but if you're going to pirate it because the source material is completely unavailable, I can understand that.
9279529	9288677	I don't see myself dropping like maybe $500 on an out-of-print series, but I can go to a site and pull it and it's fine.
9288677	9298224	If that series gets re-licensed for sale and it's $50 for it, I will buy it for $50 and hit the delete button on my downloads.
9298224	9298805	Simple as that.
9300669	9304771	Um, yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see what develops of this whole stance.
9304771	9306512	But at the end of the day, here's in here it is.
9306512	9308793	And this loops back to the beginning of the show.
9308793	9311234	And what you know, pal world and all that stuff.
9311234	9314715	If you want to support something, support it.
9314715	9318557	If you don't want to support something, don't support it and support something else.
9318557	9319097	Right?
9319097	9320238	That's it.
9320238	9324840	The games that sell and the games that you know, that's, that's the stuff they're going to make more of.
9324840	9329742	And as far as Ubisoft's next project goes, if they try to release something that you don't actually own, don't buy it.
9330501	9331942	Exactly.
9331942	9333202	That's it.
9333202	9336644	But with your wallet, that's the way we always used to phrase it.
9336644	9337384	All right.
9337384	9338844	On that note, thank you for bringing that up.
9338844	9342746	That was a, see, all the pow world discourse completely derailed.
9342746	9346728	That was the big thing on social media and then pow world came out and that just vanished.
9346728	9348048	So thank you for reminding me of that.
9348048	9348368	All right.
9348368	9349549	No problem.
9349549	9353050	Well, I do want to thank everybody for downloading our show or listening live tonight.

9383016	9386580	And on that note, Ranma, I really want to thank you for filling in tonight.
9386580	9395788	Not only did you agree to come in and take Loki's and you did a great job with the story because I knew you would because you've been doing your own thing for a long time.
9395788	9402414	Then DarkSakura unexpectedly had to bow out early and you just it's been a pleasure and a delight to do this show with you tonight.
9402414	9405937	So I just want to thank you for rolling with it and agree to be a part of our
9406457	9410820	I mean, you're always a part of this, you know, crazy being a part of it on this side of the screen.
9410820	9411020	Yeah.
9411020	9412901	Well, look at it this way.
9412901	9420366	At least this time, I'm not in behind you sitting behind you doing caramel dancing.
9420366	9423068	And I'm going to always be thankful for that.
9423068	9423648	That's for sure.
9425831	9437309	you know I always you know that fucking Carameldansen is still a meme I see it on TikToks and what I'll see is I'll see like this how I spent my weekend and it's a guy passed the fuck out on the floor as the neon lights are going off in the room and you hear
9439935	9443256	And I'm just like, and then the cats are just walking over him.
9443256	9444436	It's so funny to me.
9444436	9445497	I don't know why.
9445497	9450438	So what you're saying is you were watching video footage from MAGFest this weekend.
9450438	9451979	Oh, is that what they were doing at MAGFest?
9451979	9453219	I saw that in chat.
9453219	9455400	I wanted to say welcome back from MAGFest.
9455400	9461681	So it looked like I heard you say there's a lot of people at MAGFest, but I'm not terribly surprised.
9461681	9466883	It's kind of the I mean, I know 2023 was kind of the first year back, but this this really feels like
9467563	9470946	really, really back, you know, this year, it was like me hosting a show last night.
9470946	9473188	I don't know if y'all know, but I host live shows in town.
9473188	9474189	I love doing it.
9474189	9478972	And we had our first show of the year last night, the Sacramento Horror Film Festival was last night.
9478972	9482075	And the burlesque troupe I work with a lot was doing like a mini show.
9482075	9483416	So I was hosting for them.
9483416	9489781	And that's the first show I've done since October because you know, we just don't do a lot in that space over the holidays.
9489781	9492864	So it just felt really fucking nice to be back.
9492864	9495146	And just like it was a really good crowd.
9495146	9496087	People were into it.
9496087	9496427	It's just
9498396	9500377	Live performance feels really good.
9500377	9501937	Being in the same space feels good.
9501937	9504198	And I know we still need to be aware and cautious.
9504198	9507139	And you know, I don't want to make believe COVID doesn't exist.
9507139	9510920	But we have vaccines, we have precautions, we have ways.
9510920	9516602	It's just really nice to hear people getting together connecting again, whether it's Games Done Quick, whether it's
9517506	9523652	MagFest, whether it's your local anime convention, whether it's just getting together at the house with friends.
9523652	9527776	It's it's just nice.
9527776	9530098	I've missed you, bitches.
9530098	9531219	And we missed you, too.
9531219	9532641	Good, good.
9532641	9533422	All right.
9533422	9535924	Well, Rama, you know, you've been listening to the show long enough.
9535924	9539347	You know, this is the part of the show where I'm going to let you have a final thought.
9539347	9541049	So Rama, your final thought.
9543078	9549932	I have five bags of KitKats in my fridge and they're kinda calling me.
9549932	9551014	I'm jealous.
9551014	9552517	Those flavored KitKats are fun.
9552517	9554541	What was the best flavored KitKat you came across?
9556425	9557165	Lemon.
9557165	9558226	It was so good.
9558226	9560026	I've actually had that and it is really good.
9560026	9565488	Yeah, yeah, I have to, you know, obviously I have to watch my candy intake, but it's hard to turn down a little KitKat bar.
9565488	9566888	That's for sure.
9566888	9569989	Um, my final thought, gosh, I don't know.
9569989	9572950	I, yeah, I think I just kind of said it there.
9572950	9575531	It feels it feels really good to be doing stuff live again.
9575531	9577712	I look forward to conventions coming up again.
9577712	9581133	I look forward to my cruise, not gonna lie, because it's basically a floating convention.
9581753	9582574	at the end of February.
9582574	9583736	I'm really excited about that.
9583736	9586439	And yeah, DragonCon's on my agenda for this year.
9586439	9594850	I'm waiting for the confirmation that I'll be, you know, I don't foresee that being an issue, but I never, I never consider anything done until it's done.
9594850	9596211	But, and then who knows?
9596211	9597273	Who knows what else this year?
9597273	9597933	Anything's possible.
9597933	9598614	It's going to be a fun year.
9599395	9601416	Thanks, everyone, for being here tonight.
9601416	9603738	We'll see you in seven days to do it all again.
9603738	9604859	Loki will be back.
9604859	9606660	Hopefully DarkSakura will be feeling better.
9606660	9609842	And Ranma, you could always call in on our Discord line.
9609842	9610943	We appreciate it.
9610943	9612264	All right.
9612264	9613064	Have a good night, everybody.
9613064	9613945	We'll see you next time.
