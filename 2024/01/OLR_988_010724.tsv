10171	11752	Happy 2024!
11752	20296	It's the first week of 2024, and I don't want to admit how many times I've still written 2023, and this is also Take 5 because I can't say 2024 three times in this part correctly.
20296	21477	What's gonna happen this year?
21477	23058	What do you think I am, a precog?
23058	29001	Lawsuits, acquisitions, studio closures, studio openings, studio revivals, and most importantly, new game releases!
29001	30761	This is the well-obviously intro.
30761	37425	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to catch up and get the new year stories rolling, starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
39178	49303	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week, another year if you will, of the show where every gamer has a voice.
49303	58887	It is Orange Lounge Radio back at you live once again with episode number 988 of our show for tonight, January the 7th of 2024.
60828	67071	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm back after a little bit of a holiday break here at OLR with my co-host.
67071	72594	Say hello first and foremost to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
72594	73274	Hello.
73274	74055	Hello, hello.
74055	74675	How are you?
74675	75275	Happy New Year.
75275	78397	How was your New Year?
78397	84100	It was pretty uneventful, just ill and then going right on back to work.
84100	84280	Yeah.
85011	89115	So yeah, um, it is what it is.
89115	94101	I'm looking at getting myself a new Mac mini soon.
94101	99306	Um, but I got a new Apple watch because of some weird legislation issues going on.
100916	108860	Apparently, um, there was a, like a, a lawsuit about the, uh, O2 sensor.
108860	109221	Oh, yeah.
109221	112062	I heard about this or like they had to pull it from official store.
112062	113843	I thought that way lasted like two days though.
113843	119406	Like the- It did, but I jumped and bought mine before all that went down.
119406	120587	I needed one anyway.
120587	123709	My Series 4 wasn't, you know, lasting very long.
123709	127771	By the way, if anyone wants to buy an Apple Watch Series 4, let me know.
127771	129772	Um, but, uh,
132247	143814	We just went forward and I got Dan an Apple TV so he could have his Dolby sound and actually use our surround sound system.
143814	145495	We bought each other a lot of Transformers.
145495	151359	I was going to say, I guess I should check in on what gaming things people got or bought or otherwise for the holidays.
151359	155962	So you have that Apple TV and the sound system and all that stuff.
155962	157883	That sounds cool.
157883	159604	I have something I'll share in a minute, but go ahead.
160749	163852	SSJ100 Matt said that my VTuber got a tan.
163852	164593	No, she didn't.
164593	168097	She actually has ferret coloring very subtly.
168097	169598	She is a ferret furry.
169598	175044	Well, if you want to see the video of the show, I would invite you or chat along with us as SSJ100 Matt is.
175044	182812	I invite you to participate live because we do tape live every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voicing Geeks Network.
183172	186113	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
186113	198636	Speaking of Bobby Blackwolf, he's actually not going to be here next week because he has this side gig at a little convention online streaming thing called Awesome Games Done Quick.
198636	200837	And so he's going to be working at that convention next.
200837	206058	Well, he actually isn't working on Sunday, but you know, he has to travel, get settled in and all that good stuff.
206058	208839	He talked about some of the stuff he is tentatively set to host.
209219	213802	Remember, they can potentially change anything right up to the last minute.
213802	217444	So tentatively, he's supposed to be hosting, you know, doing the announcing.
217444	219585	He's not actually playing, okay?
219585	221906	That's somebody else very good at the video game.
221906	226109	Bobby is announcing, reading donations, you know, keeping that sort of thing moving.
226109	233933	For Bomb Rush Cyberfunk on Thursday night, which I thought was awesome, because if you don't know that one, that's like the Jet Set Radio future kind of like spiritual successor game.
234113	234453	Lies of P
258348	265063	Um, anyway, let me of course introduce our other host, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
265063	265565	Hello.
265565	266306	Hey, Loki, how are you?
267324	267944	I'm fine.
267944	269766	I'm multitasking as usual.
269766	270646	Multitasking?
270646	271046	What are you doing?
271046	272307	Are you editing a video?
272307	273928	Your latest Minecraft video in the background?
273928	274569	Or what else are you doing?
274569	275289	Yeah, I should be.
275289	276730	Yeah, I should be doing that.
276730	279712	No, I was just posting on Twitter.
279712	282734	No, just... Yeah, I should be editing.
282734	283614	I really should be.
283614	288758	I have like three different things, like three quarters of the way done.
289358	290399	type of thing.
290399	296603	I did film the last part of the Raise Works stuff, so I've been procrastinating on that.
296603	299905	You're just stacking content.
299905	300905	That was the plan.
300905	314794	Like, the plan was like, yeah, okay, I'll just have this ready to go, this will be all done, and I'll just put it out, and then that way I can take more time on this, and then there's something else new that came up, so now I'm playing that, and it's like, you know, what am I gonna do?
315174	319618	Yeah, actually, speaking of like, you know, recording videos and stuff.
319618	330927	So you know, I've been kind of screwing around on YouTube, but it's very like all the YouTubes I've been doing lately are like gameplay only I don't talk over them, which for anybody that knows me knows that I am demonstrating great restraint by not talking over videos.
330927	334069	But I've been working a lot to figure this out.
334069	338753	And I actually I finally I think crack the code because I'm able to do 4k gameplay videos now.
339153	350596	So I've actually, I, you know, did some research, some forums, checking with other people that, you know, were in similar boats and situations, because I was trying to record, ironically, Dead by Daylight off PlayStation 5.
350596	356977	So I, I got the version of PlayStation Plus that has like the game library.
356977	358798	And one of those games was Dead by Daylight.
358798	366680	And I was like, Oh, I could go in and like record myself getting adept trophies, like, you know, just, you know, not all of them, because I'm not going to buy all the DLC.
366680	367200	But like, you know,
367560	386484	the core four and the other characters that come free with it now like because I think David King is like part of the base pack now they don't sell you know him as DLC is just included with the game now so get that get the adept with the low hanging fruit so to speak the first video I did where I was trying to do adept Dwight didn't work the 4k was terrible
386784	395630	So I did some research, da da da, and I put it to use with a 4K Claudette video, which I got adept on because we had a killer that basically was not doing anything.
395630	398672	So I will be the first to admit, it's not the most interesting video in the world.
398672	401594	It's a very WTF, like, what is this ho doing?
401594	402915	Like type of thing.
402915	406797	But then I started doing some Final Fantasy XIV 4K videos.
406797	409299	So I was like, oh, this is great that I can do this now.
409299	413441	So I'm going to try to put more 4K gameplay videos up on YouTube because there's some
414522	415903	But there's not a ton.
415903	428974	And a lot of the stuff that's up there is people yapping over it going, don't forget to like, comment, subscribe to my channel and like all that crap that I just I just I want somebody to be able to have chill vibes on YouTube.
428974	430616	Because that's what I think a lot of people do.
430616	432718	They set YouTube on in the background and just let it run.
432718	433038	Right.
433038	435080	So that's, that's what I'm making.
435080	435760	I think, yeah.
436764	442068	So anyway, um, but back to podcasting and what we're doing here live on Sunday night.
442068	447233	We have some folks in chat saying SSJ 100 Mats is 2024 the year of episode 1000.
447233	447933	Indeed.
447933	448874	Indeed.
448874	453098	Uh, Mike Def says OLR will be doing awesome podcasting done at a normal pace.
453098	461545	Well, thank you for saying that we'll, we'll try our best, but for those that might be new to Orange Launch Radio, because it is a new year, uh, new year, same us, uh,
462225	466607	OLR has existed since 2002 as a live internet program.
466607	473610	The three of us, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, we all met playing a game called Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade.
473610	479893	Yes, that game with the arrows that has been mocked in pop culture, media, and praised many, many, many times.
479893	481334	They moved on.
481334	483335	They're mocking older games now.
483335	485076	Yeah, now they're mocking Tetris, but we'll get to that.
485776	497260	So we all met playing that and going to, and so we wanted to do like a live community show to talk about like DDR tournaments and the whole thing that, you know, we were doing.
497260	501381	And HotPocketry in our chat, I like that name, asked, met IRL.
501381	507143	Yeah, we all, we all actually, we all met in person at the arcade.
507143	510404	The problem is arcades are all ticket spitting machines.
510404	514625	Like this story would not happen in 2024 because arcades don't have
515205	515726	Boutique Arcade
532762	534463	Okay, it's not your typical arcade.
534463	537385	It's a very themed thing to attract different types of people.
537385	539807	Like, yeah, we could still have that story in a place like that.
539807	541849	But now like Golf Land and that whole thing?
541849	545051	No, we could, we would never meet in a place like that now.
545051	550735	So, but you know, we we all met each other and enjoyed playing together.
550735	561523	And ultimately, we stopped playing as much DDR because they weren't putting it out as much, you know, other companies started making huge music games, you know, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, hello,
561983	586242	so we just we we've kind of discovered and realized we love music games but we love music games because we actually love video games and our love of music games is a part of that so now we talk about all video games and later tonight we're going to talk about we have a story about DarkSakura one of her all-time favorite video games i don't know if it's well no i know yeah the guardian legend
586602	586822	I know
605775	606315	and more.
626380	645211	Yeah, so apparently a 13-year-old competitive Tetris player that goes by the name BlueScooty became the first person, or human, because it's been done in TASes before, to get to the NES classic kill screen on the NES, or the Tetris on the NES, the kill screen on that.
646151	655982	And there's a lot of, I think, based off of some of the videos and stuff I've watched about it, there's a lot of dodging different crashes in the game because of that.
655982	665111	But they were able to basically max out the score, max out a lot of the pieces dropped, and then it just came down to the game just doesn't function anymore.
666733	668294	So it's pretty impressive.
668294	671196	Watching the palette switches is just nuts.
671196	677380	It is somewhat the equivalent of the 256 board in Pac-Man and that infamous kill screen.
677380	678320	It is.
678320	679421	It's not one for one.
679421	689608	I know the techies, but like the best way to explain it is that it is a kill screen because of the limitations of older gaming media similar to Pac-Man and the 256 board.
689608	692890	A lot of the media has been reporting this as he beat the game.
693550	697334	I don't want to diminish his accomplishments.
697334	700457	He bested the game, I think is probably a better term to use.
700457	701958	He bested Tetris.
701958	712328	Because the funny thing is, you may or may not recall, and I don't expect the folks talking about this on NBC to know about this, but that old Tetris cartridge had two modes.
712768	717112	There was mode A and mode B and mode B I think was this mode that was endless.
717112	718033	I could have them backwards.
718033	719034	It's been a long time.
719034	720835	Mode B was the one that was endless.
720835	728723	But there actually was a mode A where once you cleared, I think it was 100 lines, you beat it, you actually did beat the game.
728723	731525	So Tetris was never unbeatable.
732546	735308	It's just this particular endless mode.
735308	740032	So there is a way to beat 8-bit Tetris on the NES.
740032	753661	You might remember you get that screen at the end that shows, I think the original NES version showed like the Russian iconic architecture and things like that on the screen and the more levels, the higher level you started on, the more of it you would see.
753661	757444	Because I remember there's actually, everybody talks about Tetris on the NES.
757444	761027	There was a, I think it was on the Advance or maybe the DS, I think it was Tetris DS.
761547	764488	DarkTetsuya says the Russian dancers were the Tengen version
786639	798245	Not to minimize the awesome accomplishment of this kid, I just think maybe the lingo that is being used may actually not really reflect what he did in this.
798245	801746	He bested the programming structure of Tetris.
801746	804128	That is still a huge accomplishment.
804128	810791	Anyway, sorry, Loki, but I just... That was one of those weird things where I was like, I don't... I think when they say he beat Tetris, it's not really the right words.
810791	811131	But anyway.
812702	814064	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft
825120	826821	It has been, was that that late?
826821	828162	I want to say it was later 80.
828162	829303	Well, the NES itself.
829303	836889	Yeah, it was it was because it Tetris NES didn't really come out to the Game Boy version had come out and the Game Boy was around like 89, I want to say.
836889	838951	So somebody in chat can fact check me on it.
838951	839431	That's fine.
839431	843995	But even it, whether it's 89 or 86, my point still stands.
843995	850439	And that is nobody until now, 2024, has ever bested Tetris.
850439	851700	Yes, a robot did it.
851700	854362	But we certainly recognize no human
855402	861928	has ever done this until now, and now a 13 year old kid did this.
861928	863489	That's amazing.
863489	867113	I mean, what an accomplishment for that kid to have done this.
867113	868514	So I know.
868514	879464	And so, you know, to celebrate it, we should just tell them that they're all their choices in life are wrong and that they should go outside because, you know, that that's what you do as a professional.
879464	879704	No.
881045	888935	news program is you just like let me tell you my outdated thoughts please let me share those with my entire audience
889477	895541	So those of you that follow gaming on social media, I'm sure know exactly what Loki is referencing.
895541	909591	If you don't, and I don't blame you, what he's referencing is that there was a Sky News report where the anchor woman made kind of an offhanded comment at the end about, I don't really want to get this quote wrong, but I'm going to paraphrase that as the end.
909591	912412	He said, maybe he should go outside or something like that.
912412	917576	And a lot of people- No, I thought it was like something worse than that, but like, yeah, I don't know.
918737	936288	I'll have to find maybe I'll find the clip or something and play it here just so I can I can Report on it accurately I suppose but a lot of people are taking very very very negatively to this clip because and I I don't I don't I understand why
938089	938629	EA wouldn't do that.
967713	971896	But people have a very knee-jerk reaction to this stuff.
971896	975419	It's a very, like, we're sick and tired of being bullied.
975419	987850	And I think, or it's that same thing where, like, the academic decathlon kids—this was the thing at my school, in high school—the academic decathlon kids were winning fucking championships and were never being praised.
988430	995316	by the student body, the way the football team, which couldn't win a fucking game to save their life was consistently.
995316	1000781	And I think a lot of us now are becoming of that age where we recognize like this is just a lot of bullshit.
1000781	1003683	So to hear somebody say this just really sucked.
1003683	1005364	Anyway, I did find the clip.
1005364	1013992	So I'm going to play this and just to clear ourselves, I am playing a clip here from Sky News for the purposes of commentary and all that good stuff.
1015868	1017229	and sorry to my co-hosts they won't hear it.
1032294	1037798	Yeah, you read stuff off a teleprompter, you know, is that a life goal of yours?
1037798	1039099	To read words off a teleprompter?
1039099	1041881	I don't think we should be telling anybody what their life goal ought to be.
1041881	1042502	Exactly.
1042502	1057112	And I just, you know, Tetris, again, a 13 year old did something on an intellectual level no human being has done in 35-ish years.
1057112	1059915	Isn't that newsworthy?
1059915	1060295	I think so.
1060928	1064370	And she says she's a mother, so feels sorry for her kids.
1064370	1067011	Oh, clearly that makes her opinion more important then.
1067011	1067972	Of course.
1067972	1071054	Yeah, but can you imagine like, hey, mom, I did this really great thing.
1071054	1076537	Yeah, well, you know, why don't you try becoming a doctor or something, you know, something that the world actually appreciates.
1076997	1080740	because what your accomplishment is just not.
1080740	1088325	Anyway, so I'm not going to give in to the people the mentality people expect from gamers and call her names.
1088325	1092247	All I'm going to say is that was a very disappointing reaction.
1092247	1100273	And as a mother, you should know better than to say that about a child when the entire country is watching you.
1100273	1101754	Oh, it's just that's how I feel.
1104522	1104942	Anyway.
1104942	1105742	She's a bully.
1105742	1106423	Nothing more.
1106423	1107083	Yeah.
1107083	1107743	Yeah.
1107743	1109264	That comment was very... Anyway.
1109264	1110384	But I don't... That's... Okay.
1110384	1112505	So I'm just gonna say that happened.
1112505	1115606	I don't want that to deflect from the accomplishments of what this kid did.
1115606	1123529	Because now, you know, now that we know this is possible and, you know, there's... We knew that there was a assisted speedrun and stuff.
1123529	1128991	I wonder how many people are going to try to emulate this now and also try to get the kill screen.
1128991	1132933	Because that became all the rage once somebody finally did it on Pac-Man Get the 256 board.
1134193	1138114	was that now everybody wanted to get the 256 board and crash the game.
1138114	1148637	So it'll be interesting to see how many other people try to kill, using my quotey fingers, in the game sense, Tetris in the in the coming weeks and months and year.
1148637	1150497	Interesting.
1150497	1156699	So, yeah, Fifth Dream is now asking, is it possible to do that faster?
1156699	1159140	That's a really good question.
1159140	1159840	I don't think so.
1161172	1164313	I, you would be talking like milliseconds.
1164313	1175355	Well, I want to say there was something about he made a, he actually made a boo-boo because as Loki was saying, you have to get a certain combination of lines in order to overflow the memory.
1175355	1178475	You actually don't want to always get Tetrises.
1178475	1180936	There's actually a point where you want to get a single.
1180936	1186097	And I believe when you're supposed to do that, he actually missed it and got a triple.
1186097	1187537	So he did have to go longer.
1188197	1191362	So can he actually do it faster?
1191362	1191883	Yes.
1191883	1194428	So that's the, I guess now that's the thing.
1194428	1200377	So, but, or, or is it like, you know, I mean, I'm sure like with speed running, there's different categories.
1200377	1201159	Is there like,
1202205	1206047	how long you can stay, you know, playing that mode or something like that.
1206047	1213831	So, like, the goal is trying to avoid all those crash points type of thing, you know.
1213831	1216452	Not my scene, but, like, that's cool, though.
1216452	1217173	No, and it is cool.
1217173	1230840	Speaking of scenes, you know, for all the negative gamer energy I've been talking about, which we've been seeing firsthand as a result of that reporting, let's talk about the positive gamer energy of the way the Tetris community has really uplifted that kid.
1231400	1236604	You know, and there were many people that were watching him do that accomplishment, giving him kudos for it.
1236604	1247131	You know, it's the equivalent of shaking the hand and saying good game at the end of the match and really, you know, uplifting this person's accomplishment, which I think is great.
1247131	1248872	SheHulk10 talks about this too.
1248872	1258599	Yes, I had heard that now some of the good things that the media did in reporting this week, again, we talked about negative, but one of the good things here, so SheHulk copy pasted something.
1259619	1275369	13 year old meets Tetris creator after beating original game was almost too much for Willis, the kid that did this, who struggled to find the words when Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of the game we know today, and Hank Rogers, the company founder and chairman,
1275709	1279010	surprised him in a Zoom interview with NBC News.
1279010	1286773	So the NBC actually got the creator of Tetris, Alexei Pajitnov, to actually meet this kid.
1286773	1288894	And that's pretty rad.
1288894	1291255	That's a really cool thing that they did there.
1291255	1293356	Meet your heroes kind of thing, right?
1293356	1294616	Being able to meet the creator.
1294616	1301459	And what an honor for Alexei, too, to be able to meet this kid 35 years after the fact.
1301459	1302119	Now, keep in mind,
1302699	1303559	He didn't do the NES version.
1303559	1304560	He lives in Seattle.
1304560	1306981	It's not like they brought him out of Russia.
1306981	1310502	But still, you know, they, they, they made the connection happen.
1310502	1311203	Right.
1311203	1327970	So, um, yeah, but like, and he didn't actually program the NES version of the game either, but still, you know, like what a cool thing for him to get to meet this kid that is, is finding new things in this scene that he did found all of those years ago.
1329068	1336551	I mean, it's certainly still more pop culture ref relevant nowadays, because we just had the Tetris movie.
1336551	1337052	Yeah.
1337052	1342054	So like, I mean, I don't know, I think it's cool.
1342054	1356140	I wish that that mother would think about, you know, hey, would I rather like, encourage a child to do, you know, like, acknowledge their greatness and, you know, give them kudos, like, obviously, as
1357190	1365596	a parent, you would know that just because they accomplished something now doesn't mean that that's going to be their just career, like that they're going to play Tetris or whatever.
1365596	1367077	So what if it is, you know?
1367077	1375023	But once again, it's like, do you really think that like that's going to influence them so much that they're just going to drop everything?
1375023	1381107	Like, no, it's just they will be in you support them in whatever they're interested in, whenever they're interested in it.
1381107	1381728	I don't understand.
1383160	1390749	why what purpose you would have like no you should really reconsider your career path it's not a career path it's just something that they did like
1391368	1391868	and he's 13.
1391868	1393369	Yeah, exactly.
1393369	1394670	Like, it's just dumb.
1394670	1396391	Well, and she was trying to make a joke.
1396391	1398793	Yeah, it's it's it's not.
1398793	1403195	It's it's an old entire joke that's been like made for decades now.
1403195	1403816	That's it.
1403816	1404496	That's it.
1404496	1414823	And I think, you know, if there's something about this whole thing, we can kind of, you know, ask the media or demand the media on the mass scale learn from this.
1414823	1417525	That is that you know what video games are art.
1418365	1421068	They're a legitimate entertainment medium.
1421068	1425895	And for some, there's a lot of people that see it as an intellectual sport at this type.
1425895	1430460	So we demand Sky News, NBC, ABC, CBS,
1431482	1446492	that you report on these with the same weight that you would report on similar types of medium and sports, sports basically, or, you know, movies or what have you, you should, and yet there's always going to be room for lighthearted commentary.
1446492	1459241	You know, there's not every movie is serious either, but like, as far as accomplishments like this, you should be giving this the same way as if a 13 year old had broken the long jump world record or something like that.
1459241	1461242	It, it deserves that same level of respect.
1461922	1484683	Or like if you want to like say well, it's not a physical activity like chess or something like that You know if they he was a chess grandmaster or something like that You would be treating it with a lot more No, no, you know the sports people are still gonna go for that over something like chess and the whole thing is is it's a statement on just where priorities are here in this country people care and
1485123	1489884	more about a game that you could, you know, break your head open over.
1489884	1497105	I was watching just all kinds of the various conditions that come as a result of playing football.
1497105	1508588	And instead, you know, it's also very ableist, too, if you think about it, because not everyone can get out and do a physical sport, but a person can get a controller in their hand and have a feet like this, you know.
1509809	1518302	Well, and to be fair, yes, I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying, but it's beyond this country too, because Sky News is based in a different country, but yes.
1518302	1521728	I know, but in a lot of the Western-based countries.
1521728	1522169	Yes, yes.
1523200	1532864	Alright, well let's move on, on a positive note, and talk about some of the things that we have been playing this week, whether it was Tetris or something else, in a segment that we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1532864	1534205	And we will start with DarkSakura.
1534205	1538466	And I guess, really, it's How Was Your Gaming Weeks, because we weren't here last week.
1538466	1540987	We did do a show on Christmas Eve, but we did it early.
1540987	1545049	So this is our first time back in our normal slot in about three weeks.
1545049	1549271	So whatever length of time you want to talk about, DarkSakura, How Was Your Gaming Time?
1550629	1554691	My gaming week was actually, time was very eventful.
1554691	1560135	Of course I played Dead by Daylight, I played Dreamlight Valley, I played Cult of the Lamb.
1560135	1566819	I tried to stream Baldur's Gate 3, and it would crash only while I was streaming.
1567899	1576045	I found that there's something about the cloud saves for Steam that can be a problem, so I might try it again.
1576045	1583151	But basically, every time it's failed, I've just played Colts of the Lamb, because I have Steam open already.
1583151	1586413	And I played some Weird Al, you know, pinball.
1586413	1591297	We got Transformers, which I haven't played because I really do not like the movies at all.
1594065	1595346	What else did I play?
1595346	1598287	I played some other stuff.
1598287	1604709	I played some Saturn games, which I'll be getting a little bit into in a bit.
1604709	1615354	And when you raided your friend, Rob, and I was there, I went in full-on tutorial mode on how to play the Cardian Legend.
1615354	1617175	Oh, Chicken Stew was streaming that.
1617175	1617635	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1617635	1618195	Yeah.
1618195	1619415	Good pal of mine on Twitch.
1619415	1620616	Yeah, it was really fun.
1622904	1623464	All right.
1623464	1627665	And yeah, that's just what it did.
1627665	1642468	I'm really enjoying Baldur's Gate 3, but I hate that I can't play it with my controller because it registers both my controller and keyboard as two separate players.
1642468	1648450	And I can't get it to unrecognize one versus the other, so I just had to play completely on keyboard.
1650575	1652998	Alright, well, we will move on to Loki.
1652998	1654839	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1654839	1656261	I just played Minecraft.
1656261	1662908	So, you know, it's I know it's a shake up from normal, but it is just Minecraft.
1662908	1668434	This week, I joined a new SMP called Fever Dream, which is a
1669315	1678400	Collaborative event put on by MC Collab Station, which is kind of a Discord community of a bunch of different Minecraft content creators.
1678400	1693187	And unlike some of the other events that we were supposed to be in, like MC Rewind, that didn't end up happening, they actually have the know-how and organization to be able to put together an event with 100 plus people.
1693767	1695728	So there's quite a few people on the server.
1695728	1697729	Not all at once, obviously.
1697729	1704433	The server was really struggling that first day, but they did get it finally fleshed out and it's been working okay.
1704433	1710095	The premise of this SMP is that it gets stranger as it goes on.
1710095	1712217	And it is getting stranger.
1712217	1716439	So every day there's updates or data packs that are being added in.
1717159	1720182	that change things.
1720182	1729933	So the overall terrain is just kind of modded anyways, but there's like, you know, weird graphics or there's strange things that happens.
1729933	1737861	Like yesterday there was flower mimics where mobs would just spawn out of flowers and start attacking you.
1738632	1750217	for no reason, or we'd have the dragon fight, which is a bunch of flowers and they kept spawning in killer bunnies from, you know, uh, uh, Monty Python, the Holy Grail.
1750217	1751958	So that was fun.
1751958	1755520	Um, just like strange things like that.
1755520	1761843	So this SMP I'm planning on building in a, uh,
1763027	1774556	I'm leaning heavily into the YouTube algorithm and putting together the cringiest builds possible for like YouTube thumbnails and that type of thing.
1774935	1784561	So the area that I'm building is called the Cringelands, and some of the more popular memes nowadays are going to make an appearance there.
1784561	1795588	And I've got huge builds already planned, so it's... Right now it's been grinding this entire week, getting just the basic setup so that I can build giant things like that.
1795588	1797869	So that's what I've been working on this entire week.
1799494	1802555	also should be editing the other series and stuff as well.
1802555	1807496	Have you tried at all the Fortnite Lego stuff?
1807496	1809097	No, I haven't got a chance to try that yet.
1809097	1809977	It's pretty fun.
1809977	1811057	I've been playing it a little bit.
1811057	1815179	It's it's I I'm not sure you could do like the builds like what you're doing.
1815179	1816019	Well, I don't know.
1816019	1817519	No, it's different.
1817519	1818480	But yeah, it's very different.
1818480	1819540	But it's it's fun.
1819540	1819920	I like it.
1820529	1826915	Yeah, it would be I think the stuff that they have and there's more kind of like the fortnight building right where you build walls and stuff.
1826915	1827876	Yeah, yeah.
1827876	1833482	And that's kind of like how they had with I think Lego worlds is like that too.
1833482	1836084	I don't remember too much because I only played that for a little bit.
1836084	1838226	This plays way better than Lego worlds.
1838226	1839447	Like it's just right.
1839447	1839948	Better done.
1839948	1843672	But anyway, we'll get your opinions on that someday when you've tried it.
1843672	1844873	I'll have to check it out at some point.
1844873	1845033	Yeah.
1845735	1846776	Let's talk about my gaming week.
1846776	1858966	So my gaming week, a lot of similar stuff that I've talked about on the show before, I mentioned earlier, like some things I was doing like dead by daylight, a lot of like the outdoor gaming stuff to Pikmin Bloom, I just hit level 83.
1858966	1861628	It maxes out at 100.
1861628	1862528	Maybe I'll get there this year.
1862528	1863849	We'll see.
1863849	1869073	And, you know, Pokemon Go, I did the Rowlet community day that was yesterday for a little bit.
1869073	1870715	It was kind of rainy, so I couldn't do it a lot.
1872196	1874517	I've actually been playing more Final Fantasy XIV.
1874517	1875717	I actually was taking a break.
1875717	1888404	You might remember I was talking more about World of Warcraft Season of Discovery and Diablo 4, and I was kind of playing some of those games for a few months, but, you know, I kind of did everything I wanted to do in the current Diablo season, and same thing with Season of Discovery.
1888404	1889565	I'm still doing alts.
1889565	1893687	I think Shane and I did a stream earlier this week where we were doing new characters,
1894187	1898572	And we're gonna do new characters again later this week, by the way, so stay tuned for that.
1898572	1902837	But outside of that, I've just been kind of getting back into Final Fantasy 14.
1902837	1909104	And, you know, having taken a couple months off the game, it's been really nice to kind of go back and, you know, it
1909224	1916128	It just feels like, oh, yes, it's going back to an old favorite and, you know, like, oh, yeah, I miss doing this and playing stuff.
1916128	1921231	They also, by the way, did a bunch of Final Fantasy 14 announcements this weekend.
1921231	1928274	Yesterday was the final fan fest leading up to the release of Dawn Trail, which is going to be out in the summer.
1928274	1934618	They wouldn't give a specific date yet because Yoshi P is paranoid about having to delay the game again, like what happened with Endwalker.
1934618	1938300	So he will not give a date until it's locked in, which, in my opinion, good for him.
1938840	1958679	Good for him for sticking to that because I'm sure the folks that be that Square Enix really want him to lock in a date so they can start the marketing and the pre orders but he won't do it till he's got he knows it's done but they announced that the new class so there's going to be two new classes in Dawn Trail there's Viper which is kind of an original it's not really based on anything in prior
1959199	1961242	But this other one is a deep cut.
1961242	1962783	It's a Pictomancer.
1962783	1965967	I think it's a Pictomancer or Picto... Pictonight.
1965967	1966528	I can't remember.
1966528	1967889	It's Picto something.
1967889	1968370	It's Realm.
1968370	1970452	They'll be using drawings.
1970452	1972174	It's Realm from Final Fantasy VI.
1972174	1973356	Yes, they will be using drawings.
1973356	1974016	I love it.
1974016	1974357	It actually...
1974617	1978439	You should look up the video, DarkSakura, of the job in action.
1978439	1980119	Actually paints like Moogles.
1980119	1989283	It doesn't play, they said it doesn't play exactly like Realm because it doesn't just draw monsters, but the character will draw like scenery and that's what they use to attack.
1989283	1990544	It looks really cool.
1990544	1994946	It looks very like Splatoon-esque, but it's kind of neat.
1994946	1995646	I really liked it.
1995646	1999228	So yeah, I'm looking forward to the expansion.
1999228	2001269	My only like complaint
2002049	2004852	is that this is very formulaic.
2004852	2009736	The Final Fantasy XIV expansions, patch cycle, everything is so formulaic.
2009736	2013059	Like, level cap goes up by 10.
2013059	2015001	There's going to be six zones.
2015001	2017883	There's going to be one eight-man raid, a one 24-man raid.
2017883	2022868	There's going to be, you know, it's, I could probably even tell you what the item levels will be.
2022868	2024709	It's starting to get that predictable.
2024709	2028473	I just, I would love to see them shake up the formula just a little bit.
2029073	2048427	I would love for them to yank the mythic dungeon concept from World of Warcraft, which is basically instead of scaling you down to do old dungeons with friends, scale the old dungeons up to make them, you know, because there's so many awesome old dungeons that people haven't played in a long time because they're not relevant.
2048427	2050148	So I would love to see that.
2050148	2057493	But the most interesting feature they were talking about was the brand new casual mode, which was I think cosmic exploration is what they called it.
2058333	2062195	And that looks really cool because it looked like the island sanctuary but on different planets.
2062195	2063976	So I'm excited to see that.
2063976	2065417	That could be very interesting.
2065417	2071100	But anyway, yes, so I've gone back to Final Fantasy XIV and I know we weren't talking about the updates anywhere else in the show.
2071100	2072621	So I just want to mention that.
2072621	2079765	So the other thing that I've been playing this week, I got a Christmas gift from Alan.
2079765	2082287	And what I got, and it was on my list, I'd asked for it.
2082907	2093598	I put a few things down so he had the choice because you might remember I said Loki I put the Oh my god, why is it the the machine with the crank that you got?
2093598	2094719	God damn it.
2094719	2097182	Thank you the playdate the playdate was on my list.
2097182	2097883	But I got this
2101169	2105110	I'm reaching down to grab the smooshed box, but I can show you what it looks like.
2105110	2106870	It's an Evercade.
2106870	2109111	It's a retro game console.
2109111	2109831	Yep.
2109831	2114512	And it actually uses cartridges and there's actually two consoles.
2114512	2115953	So actually you can see it in the back.
2115953	2118913	There's actually two cartridge slots in this thing.
2118913	2125915	So you put two cartridges in there and then it kind of just shows you like a mishmash of those different cartridges and the games that are in it.
2126235	2130477	So it comes with a Technos collection and a Data East collection.
2130477	2134399	So yes, I get to have burger time all over again.
2134399	2137260	But they put some deep fucking cuts in these.
2137260	2145364	And that's what I actually like about Evercade is that yeah, there's a couple big games, but they put some deep fucking cuts in these like and I was playing.
2145364	2145905	What was it?
2145905	2146905	Was it Gate?
2146905	2147746	Wizard Fire?
2147746	2150447	I was playing Wizard Fire, which I had never played before.
2150447	2151808	But it's like a like a 2D
2152828	2153529	Nights of the Round Golden Axe
2166528	2171472	Alan also said, well, I can't just buy you the system and only let you have the pack-in cartridges.
2171472	2173453	So does he know me or what?
2173453	2182080	He bought me the C64 Collection cartridge, which apparently is the first of three volumes of the C64 Collection.
2182080	2184762	But this has, okay, so this has games you would know.
2184762	2187865	Summer Games, Jumpman, Winter Games,
2188465	2194167	AliCat, Impossible Mission, Gateway to Afashi, Idris Alpha, Storm Lord, Lee, Movie Monster Game, Marauder
2206750	2212152	I did have some problems setting this system up to begin with, but I got through it.
2212152	2222195	What happened was it was having a hard time seeing my Wi-Fi, and I couldn't get it to connect to the internet to see it, and it would not see my router or anything.
2222195	2230919	I had to do a hard system reset by using the flash button on the back of the console, basically putting the pin in there, and that fixed it.
2230919	2234460	So just in case you get an Evercade, if it has problems out the box,
2235120	2236000	There you go.
2236000	2239622	S. Jonah Matt says, Yeah, those Evercades are looking more and more like a solid deal.
2239622	2243924	Well, the cool thing is they also make a handheld, but they handle looks cool.
2243924	2246265	What's the cartridges will work in the handheld.
2246265	2255549	But what's interesting about the handhelds, and because Alan was looking into this, he's like, they don't make a cartridge for the Capcom games.
2255549	2260511	If you want to get the Capcom games, you have to buy the handheld that has them baked in.
2261960	2265462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2293294	2314861	a little puzzle sheet that lets you you actually put it so if you notice it actually says gribbly gobbly if you put in that code you unlock a bonus game and it does some it does some interesting things too apparently if you get volume two of c64 and you put volume one and two in at the same time you get a bonus game
2315501	2317983	So it does interesting cute things like that.
2317983	2324767	But also look at this, an actual fucking manual that actually, and I love how this is put together.
2324767	2330810	It actually shows the game, tells you a little bit about it, shows like a screenshot of what it looks like.
2330810	2339115	Even a game like Impossible Mission, it does its very best to explain what the fuck is going on with the puzzle pieces at the bottom and all that stuff.
2339115	2344679	Like honest to God, like even if like paying 30 bucks for a cartridge sounds like a lot,
2345379	2351320	these manuals almost make it where it's like they're they're little books, DarkSakura, they're little books.
2351320	2352141	I'm down.
2352141	2353061	I love it.
2353061	2353941	I'd love to see it.
2353941	2355681	So yeah, props to Evercade.
2355681	2360642	Even if you pissed me off for about five minutes until I figured out how to fix you, I'm enjoying you as a machine now.
2360642	2362483	And DarkSakura, I fucking thought of you.
2362483	2365023	Is it on the box?
2365023	2366904	Does it talk about the expansions on the box?
2368294	2369254	expansions.
2369254	2371855	Well, the cartridges, the other cartridges that you can buy.
2371855	2376116	There's things like the Jellicoe collection, the Intellivision collection.
2376116	2382258	There's an Indie Heroes collection, Loki, YYR games, if you're out there listening.
2382258	2388579	Well, I'm just telling you right now that those Indie Heroes, many of them are Nest Maker games.
2388579	2392040	I'm telling you, I'm like, hey, put my stuff on the cartridge.
2392040	2394861	Loki, Loki, Loki.
2395865	2396665	Get on it.
2396665	2401628	You have to get pixel poops on one of these things or like a free game that's in there or something.
2401628	2401908	I don't know.
2401908	2403889	But anyway, wait, I don't want to misstate anything.
2403889	2407471	So I'm pretty sure cartridges list.
2407471	2409973	I'm trying to bring up the list of Oh, yes.
2409973	2410913	Okay, here it is.
2410913	2415316	So they actually have they thank you to the kind people at Wikipedia that do the work for me.
2415316	2419278	But I didn't notice as I was with some of these they don't make anymore.
2419818	2427812	like the Namco Museum collections you can't get actually, well you can get them but you get them from jacked up prices but I'm almost positive
2428578	2433460	That's right, Toaplan Arcade 1 and Toaplan Arcade 2.
2433460	2440804	That was the one where I was like, oh, oh, DarkSakura and I need to have a talk because like- All the Truxton we can stand.
2440804	2442905	Truxton is in number one.
2442905	2446246	Tiger Healy, Zero Wing, that's right, is in there.
2446246	2448967	Twin Cobra in volume two.
2448967	2454370	So yeah, when I saw that there were Toaplan cartridges, I was like, oh, DarkSakura and I have to have a talk.
2455606	2456247	IndieHeroes
2470888	2474251	maybe not all nest maker games because these aren't all nest games.
2474251	2480417	Doodle World, Flea, Cubo 3, Pretty Sure Ployed.
2480417	2489145	If the powers that be by some fucking miracle at Evercade are listening to this little show, which I doubt is the case, please contact us.
2489145	2492328	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, please.
2494983	2497344	Anyway, we're enjoyable and full of ideas.
2497344	2504747	That's that's well and we have a game we'd like you to put like I say we it's really Loki's game but we'll but DarkSakura and I are going to be the shills for it.
2504747	2509649	So we have a game we'd like you to put on your next collection.
2509649	2511950	Or even even as a freebie.
2511950	2513751	I'll sell it cheap.
2513751	2517132	Very, very, very cheap.
2517132	2524215	So anyway, I yeah, I thought sjo100mat says so the obvious question, when are you or are you able to stream playing this?
2524795	2525995	Please look forward to it.
2525995	2526856	Yes, I am able.
2526856	2528576	It's a simple HDMI cable.
2528576	2530717	Oh, that's the thing I got to warn y'all.
2530717	2533137	That was the one downside to this Evercade.
2533137	2539199	Even though it was there on Amazon, I do want to warn you all, it does not come with an HDMI cable.
2539199	2542880	But thankfully, like I have I have one that I pass around to stream.
2542880	2544781	I have it goes to the PS5, then I move to the switch.
2544781	2546361	Now I move to the Evercade to stream it.
2546361	2548722	It also does not come with an AC adapter.
2549741	2551362	Yeah, that's pretty typical nowadays.
2551362	2552003	Yeah.
2552003	2558449	So you have to get the USB plug and you put it in there.
2558449	2559930	That's how you have to.
2559930	2561972	So just just read that part carefully.
2561972	2567116	If you do look at investing in one of these, you need to have those cables or you're going to get me in for a nasty surprise.
2567116	2570039	So that's my one little thing.
2570039	2570599	Oh, interesting.
2570599	2574543	Bobby Blackwell points out the the Atari 2600 plus is the same way.
2574543	2574763	Wow.
2575765	2576165	All right.
2576165	2577126	Yeah.
2577126	2580849	Silly, though, it's for the environment.
2580849	2581149	Sure.
2581149	2582951	But it's really just to save a buck.
2582951	2583631	Yeah.
2583631	2587654	When I buy all those AC adapters and keep losing them, then the I'm really saving the environment.
2587654	2587955	All right.
2587955	2591037	Anyway, that was I just want to talk about that.
2591037	2594620	And yeah, yeah, I do want to buy some more of those cartridges for sure.
2594620	2598143	I'm kind of bummed they don't make the Namco ones anymore, because those are the ones I have my eye on.
2598143	2599323	I might.
2599323	2601065	I might pay the premium and get them anyway.
2602170	2607174	I'd rather get them now before these things are like completely out of print and then it's a wild cost.
2607174	2607714	So we'll see.
2607714	2608655	We'll see.
2608655	2611097	Anyway, um, that's it for my Game of the Week.
2611097	2613579	Let's talk about what else is going on in the news.
2613579	2614899	Programming update.
2614899	2618062	I mentioned earlier, Bobby Blackwolf will not be here next week.
2618362	2622545	We will, so please still be here next week at nine o'clock Eastern.
2622545	2637754	Maybe if I bat my eyelashes kindly, Bobby Blackwolf will send us some footage, although I think he actually gets to Games Done Quick that day, so I can't guarantee we're gonna get something like that, because he may not have the time to put it together, but we'll be here next week.
2637754	2645898	Our next show that we will have off, and I don't know if DarkSakura and Loki remember this, we will not be here February 25th.
2647139	2648659	So we'll be here pretty much every week.
2648659	2654040	But February 25, I am on the Star Trek cruise again this year.
2654040	2656621	So I'll be in the middle of the ocean.
2656621	2662122	Or is that the day we're actually let's see it leaves here one to know that is the day that I'm going to be in Curacao.
2662122	2671344	So I will not be thinking of this program because I will be in the Caribbean sipping a very froofy homosexual drink out of a pineapple.
2671704	2674369	or whatever I could find or a coconut.
2674369	2678355	So that's that's my, that's my plan is the cruise.
2678355	2681941	And what because Star Trek cruise while I'm doing this.
2681941	2685447	So you know, drink in one hand, live long and prosper in the other.
2685447	2685668	All right.
2687216	2690199	See how it is your real priorities are.
2690199	2698327	Yes, my real priority is meeting LeVar Burton and any of you hoes would do that exact same thing if you had the opportunity.
2698327	2704594	And yes, we are getting we are getting a meet and greet with LeVar Burton or a photo with LeVar Burton.
2704594	2705535	So I'm very excited about that.
2706815	2708858	I wonder if Todd's at this one this year.
2708858	2709438	He is.
2709438	2711701	They just announced him a few weeks ago.
2711701	2713723	He is going back this year.
2713723	2714584	He's such a cool guy.
2714584	2715265	Yeah.
2715265	2719711	Todd Stashwick, for those who don't know, he played... What was his character's name in Picard?
2720745	2725166	The No Guy, Shaw, that was it.
2725166	2725747	Shaw.
2725747	2726947	That's what I've been saying.
2726947	2728207	Shaw.
2728207	2731108	But yeah, he's the No Guy.
2731108	2732429	Anyway.
2732429	2735069	But yeah, no, they have a lot of great guests this year.
2735069	2739691	The Big Land is Sonequa Martin-Green is their captain this year.
2740911	2743976	Huge, huge upgrade from Shatner.
2743976	2746640	So Niko Martin-Green, of course, from Discovery.
2746640	2750606	So, which unfortunately, they're not making any more Discovery.
2750606	2753911	So they have her, they have Doug Jones, again, is going back.
2753911	2755614	So they have a lot of cool Discovery people.
2756014	2759118	I love Doug Jones's Saru.
2759118	2760239	Yes, he's great.
2760239	2763223	And he's, he's the nicest guy in person.
2763223	2774957	He was just walking because the thing about the thing about celebrities on cruises, some of them will stay in their room and never leave and just hang with their families and that, you know, secure part of the ship Shatner.
2775951	2779513	Some of them go out and mingle with everybody else and have drinks.
2779513	2781755	And this is the wild thing.
2781755	2783876	So like, imagine this couch behind me.
2783876	2787638	And for those on the podcast feed, I have a couch behind me when we do the show live.
2787638	2789500	Imagine I'm sitting here having a drink.
2790442	2794323	on this couch right there behind me also having a drink.
2794323	2797824	John Delancey and Robert Picardo just sitting right behind me having a drink.
2797824	2803725	John Delancey, of course, cue Robert Picardo, the holographic doctor emergency program from Voyager.
2803725	2806086	So like that's that's the runnage you have of people.
2806086	2809647	And Doug Jones actually was just walking around giving out hugs.
2810407	2815952	And when he gives hugs, he uses his big alien arms to like wrap around your entire head.
2815952	2820756	And I was like, he's very generous because like some of these people are a little strange.
2820756	2823799	So he's very, he's very full of love to be doing something like that.
2823799	2827042	So, um, but yeah, I'm a fan anyway.
2827042	2827682	All right.
2827682	2828643	Enough about me.
2828643	2830425	He naturally just moves so gracefully.
2830939	2833502	Yes, he really does.
2833502	2834223	He really does.
2834223	2834864	Anyway.
2834864	2836426	All right, let's talk about gaming news.
2836426	2837607	Let's get into it.
2837607	2839950	Oh, God, I'm sick of this one already, Loki.
2839950	2843174	But we have to talk about it because it's impacting all the industries.
2843174	2843915	But let's get to it.
2844534	2863103	of course so yes because we're in the year of 2024 um due to copyright steamboat willy has made it into the public domain but that doesn't mean that like oh hey cool i'm gonna put mickey mouse in whatever i want now no no that is just steamboat willy and so what do we get out of that
2863823	2868528	TheLowestBottomOfTheBarrelTrashHorrorGenreThings
2884636	2885736	It looks not good.
2885736	2889379	It's the equivalent of that Winnie the Pooh thing from last year.
2889379	2890820	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2890820	2891801	Yeah, basically.
2891801	2899747	And then there's also a game now called Infestation Origins, previously called Infestation 88, but 88 kind of ties into Nazis.
2899747	2904190	So they decided to change the name because that's probably not a good thing.
2904190	2906892	So now it is also just a
2908013	2919581	uh survival game with some you know steamboat willy looking thing chasing you down cool i mean i don't know it's more of like
2920829	2944022	You knew this was gonna happen with some of the stuff and then people have been like reacting to like Steambo Willy and stuff But once again, it's Disney Disney's not gonna be like, oh you guys win you get Mickey Mouse now God, no, they own the trademark for that stuff They own that's why Mickey Mouse has been like redesigned so many other times like if they are not letting their cash cow mouse go because of
2945618	2946719	Mere Copyright Law
2964597	2972822	The copyright laws in some other countries, like I think Chile's one of them, are actually more stringent and more favor the copyright holders for longer.
2972822	2976264	And if you don't think Disney's going to flex that muscle, ha!
2976264	2981006	And so I was talking about this a little bit with Bobby on his show a little while ago.
2982347	2988888	I think because I'm already sick of hearing about this like every and I feel like people are just doing this because they can which yes, it's part of that.
2988888	2999011	But I also feel like people because they know Disney's lawyers are infamously the most litigious bunch almost the entire country.
2999011	3009033	I think people love to be able to needle and poke and they want to push the envelope just as far as they can go with this whole thing without getting sued.
3009033	3010373	But as far as I'm concerned,
3011294	3031609	y'all other people that are jumping on this with your horror movies and your video games have fun pushing that envelope and seeing how far you can get because the minute you cross the line heaven help you with disney's legal squad oh yeah help you and i would suggest instead of purchasing infestation origins or whatever trash that is i'm
3032009	3052287	One of the other things they did bring up in the article here is talking about FumiGames' new FPS game, Mouse, which, unlike ripping off Steamboat Willie, basically does what Cuphead did with that genre of cartoon, adapted the style of it and made it its own thing.
3052287	3058093	And so now they have an FPS game that's kind of done in that animation style, all black and white.
3058573	3059775	It looks pretty awesome.
3059775	3061898	So Mouse is the one to go check out.
3062998	3066159	There's another one just like, it'll come out, it'll be trash.
3066159	3067320	And that'll be that.
3067320	3069241	Like, and everybody will forget about it.
3069241	3070541	Like they forgot about the Winnie the Pooh movie.
3070541	3075423	Yeah, the fact that we're all sick of these derivative reboots in Hollywood.
3075423	3077984	Don't forget that also applies to Steamboat Willie.
3077984	3084367	Just because it's in the public domain, doesn't change the fact that we're sick of seeing the same thing over and over in media.
3084367	3085448	You know, right?
3085448	3088169	How do we all feel about the Mean Girls movie that's coming out?
3088993	3090555	Like, I think there's a lot of people.
3090555	3090735	Oh, yeah.
3090735	3091657	What are they doing?
3091657	3092598	Oh, they're redoing it.
3092598	3094120	Well, here's the thing.
3094120	3095642	Here's the thing.
3095642	3099868	They're completely and utterly hiding the fact, and I don't know why.
3099868	3102652	They are completely and utterly hiding the fact it's a musical.
3103607	3108109	and all of the marketing, all of the trailers, they're hiding the fact it's a musical.
3108109	3114211	The reason why Mean Girls is being done again, it's literally the exact same thing that happened to Hairspray.
3114211	3119913	John Waters made Hairspray in 88, it became a Broadway musical, now they're making a movie out of the musical.
3120433	3123294	There was a Mean Girls musical on Broadway and off.
3123294	3125555	I know there was a musical on Broadway.
3125555	3127956	This is the movie adaptation of that.
3127956	3132558	None of the marketing makes that apparent whatsoever, unless you're looking for it.
3132558	3137620	You will notice in some quick shots, you can be like, they're doing like a coordinated dance or they're doing that.
3137620	3138661	Yeah, it's a fucking musical.
3139588	3143190	but there's so many people that are like, we don't need another Mean Girls.
3143190	3144471	We have the original Mean Girls.
3144471	3145292	It's still a good movie.
3145292	3146152	We don't need another one.
3146152	3149154	It's just, it's the same thing with Steamboat Willie.
3149154	3168107	Now, a Steamboat Willie musical, on the other hand, oh, and Deidre Maes, of course, the most obvious answer, literally sitting in front of my face, The Color Purple, literally the exact same thing happening right now, again, was a movie in the 80s, goes to Broadway, and now is a movie with the same Broadway star, Fantasia from American Idol.
3168107	3169368	It's, yes, literally that.
3169968	3177333	So, you know, I mean, that movie is a lot older than Mean Girls.
3177333	3178214	That is true.
3178214	3184739	That movie has about 20 years on Mean Girls, but still, it's got a lot of music in the movie already.
3184739	3185699	Yeah.
3185699	3192344	I mean, I'm not going to tell you how many times I saw the color purple growing up because my mother would watch it every freaking time it came on HBO.
3192344	3192604	Oh, yeah.
3192604	3194045	My mom loved that movie, too.
3194045	3196046	I ended up watching it a lot as a result, too.
3196046	3198048	So, yeah.
3200307	3204771	And by the way, in my universe, Wicked is only ever a book.
3204771	3209834	Well, but the thing about Wicked is that it was never, well, I guess some would say it was the Wizard of Oz.
3209834	3212356	Well, it's a different story.
3212356	3217760	Yeah, derivative writing is normal.
3217760	3218460	Yeah, yeah.
3218460	3220322	I mean, that happens.
3220322	3223084	And the Oz books went in the public domain some time ago.
3224375	3227318	Oh god, they've been in the public domain for ages.
3227318	3231301	We had a crappy Disney movie a few years ago as a result of that.
3231301	3233043	Ooh, actually, was it?
3233043	3234384	Which one?
3234384	3235645	Not Return to Oz.
3235645	3237186	That was, I think, the first.
3237186	3237727	That was great.
3237727	3238948	That was dark, but it was good.
3238948	3239808	It fucked us up.
3239808	3242511	But there was one in about 2006 with, like, Leo.
3242511	3244252	Oh, Oz the Great and Powerful.
3244252	3244612	That's it.
3244612	3245653	Oz the Great and Powerful.
3245653	3246094	That's the one.
3246957	3248239	They, that didn't work.
3248239	3256189	They were hoping to reboot the franchise and do like a multi-movie franchise with that, but it just didn't work out because... I don't know.
3256189	3257250	Nobody was asking for it.
3257250	3261335	Well, because people still watch The Original Wizard of Oz.
3262216	3264537	People like these freaking musicals.
3264537	3265377	It's a thing now.
3265377	3265857	Yeah.
3265857	3267017	You know?
3267017	3271058	And as long as there's a market for it, they're gonna put it out.
3271058	3273459	We have the choice not to watch it.
3273459	3275959	And it's as simple as that.
3275959	3280461	I'm, right now, for some of that, I'm just sort of in the camp of don't piss in other people's cornflakes.
3280461	3281781	Yeah.
3281781	3289623	You know, if they're not hurting anybody, and they're not shoving it down my throat, and they're enjoying it, let them enjoy it.
3290711	3294792	Yeah, I actually kind of- As long as it's not profiting like Nazis or something.
3294792	3299134	I actually kind of wish they would adapt the Jagged Little Pill musical into a movie.
3299134	3308797	I think it- I don't know how they do it without cutting some serious corners because it is about three hours worth of musical, but I hope they make it a movie.
3308797	3309217	I really do.
3309597	3311559	How long was Avatar The Way of Water?
3311559	3312180	Yeah, that's true.
3312180	3313642	So you can make a three hour musical.
3313642	3314703	I mean, look at the sound of music.
3314703	3315704	There's nothing wrong with that.
3315704	3317987	But, you know, usually they don't.
3317987	3322972	I mean, look at Dune, the original version of Dune.
3322972	3327638	But what I don't want is a part one and a part two, which, by the way, is what they're doing with Wicked.
3328868	3332891	But I'll see, I will see that Wicked movies.
3332891	3336153	I will see those Wicked movies because number one, Ariana Grande.
3336153	3337814	Number two, Michelle Yeoh.
3337814	3344619	Like number three, that fucking finest fuck guy that voices Graha Tia, what's it, Jonathan Bailey.
3344619	3346561	They're all in that movie.
3346561	3350684	I will be seated for the Wicked movie and I don't want to hear it.
3350684	3352245	I don't want to hear it.
3352245	3354567	Well, maybe I have to see it because Ariana Grande's in it.
3354567	3354767	Yeah.
3355563	3359305	So I mean, you know, I want to know what what her hair is made out of.
3359305	3361186	I understand that people may be upset.
3361186	3364667	It's Ariana Grande, not Kristen Chenoweth, but.
3364667	3369170	It it has been 20 years, so they had to recast some things.
3369170	3371711	Hopefully, Kristen still has a cameo in it somewhere.
3372133	3377377	You know what, I'm fan of three little words, Rob.
3377377	3378657	Deal with it.
3378657	3380699	Okay.
3380699	3381099	All right.
3381099	3384621	Well, Sony's gonna have to deal with this.
3384621	3400912	There was some information that was inadvertently leaked, cluing us all in that there is a Horizon, as in Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West, there is a Horizon MMORPG that is confirmed to be in development basically because a job listing got posted.
3404334	3412317	So a video game researcher posted on Twitter earlier this week to detail the things that they knew about the game.
3412317	3424923	It is an MMORPG to be precise, which also is in line with the fact that we know that Sony is trying to create a series, like what was it, six games, you know, for the PS5 that are going to be, you know, games as a service type of thing.
3424923	3428024	So this would fall in line with that whole thing too.
3428024	3430485	The game is now essentially confirmed to be in development.
3430865	3443049	It's developed under the codename Project Skyline, with the initial codename being Project H. And NCSoft registered a domain for what appears to be a game titled Land of Salvation.
3443049	3447110	Land of Salvation could maybe be the title for the Horizon MMO.
3447110	3452072	This assumption is based on the fact it's the only unannounced game we know of that could be revealed soon.
3452072	3455233	Of course, it could be some other project that we're not aware of.
3455233	3459154	And then there was a job listing for something called Project Skyline,
3459474	3460115	PS5 NCSoft
3481152	3481732	Horizon MMO
3508567	3514239	So, until we wait for games like Horizon the MMO, we will have to stick to the classics, right DarkSakura?
3515379	3518221	Of course, and I have a good classic to talk about.
3518221	3524265	It's hard for me to think of this as a classic, but I do have so many good memories about it.
3524265	3532651	It was a game that was put in my hands and I was told to beat if I expected to stay in this apartment.
3532651	3541678	But of course, I am talking about the game known as, we saw it as Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
3543159	3556887	But the Japanese version was a direct sequel to Dracula X on PC Engine, and it was called Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight.
3556887	3559309	It had problems.
3559309	3560289	Well, I'll take that back.
3560289	3561730	The PlayStation version was great.
3561730	3564372	It was about as perfect of a game as you could get.
3565171	3579716	But we knew that there were things cut from it, you know, like there's that whole scene where you can get the trap door in the courtyard to open with a little bit of trickery, and then it just goes down to a safe space, but it looked like there was something else meant to be there.
3579716	3585818	And of course, when the Saturn version came out, it did restore those areas that
3588099	3593264	that were missing from the game, like the underground garden.
3593264	3602432	And there were also the ability to play as Maria and Richter Belmont.
3602432	3606836	They gave him his outfit from the cutscenes, but
3608348	3610449	A lot of people weren't satisfied with it.
3610449	3613752	I mean, we played the shit out of it.
3613752	3622658	But we did do a side-by-side comparison with both Japanese versions and found that there were transparencies missing.
3622658	3630803	The Saturn that is a much better 2D machine wasn't doing the 2D to its best capability.
3630803	3631383	And of course,
3632569	3636732	I could only understand about 25% of what people were saying.
3636732	3647759	So now there is a full translated version of Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight into English using the PSP version as its template.
3647759	3655584	And it reduces the load times, has bug fixes, and lets you use the Saturn's 4MB RAM cartridge.
3659230	3664337	It restored as many of the transparency effects as were possible.
3664337	3669984	Resized some of the sprites to match the PlayStation version.
3669984	3674029	You have direct access to the Global Map, the finalized Global Map.
3675191	3690371	It removes some horizontal lines, you can skip videos and dialogues, of course you have Richter's alternate costume, they fix some bugs, and there's a hard mode.
3691392	3700357	So, uh, I was rather, uh, interested when I, cause I, I've gotten it to work on my, uh, I'll say, I'll say it right now.
3700357	3713323	I have it on an emulator, but I'm allowed to play it on the emulator because I own both, uh, I own both the English and Japanese PlayStation versions and I own the, the Japanese, of course, Saturn version.
3713323	3717645	So I started playing it in about,
3719754	3724858	45 minutes ago, because I finally was able to get it to work.
3724858	3727880	And yeah, I started right off with Maria.
3727880	3731303	The menus were in English and I'm like, heck yeah.
3731303	3737668	Even, you know, has the specific tracks for whoever you decide is your your intro character.
3737668	3742292	I absolutely suggest remapping the buttons.
3742292	3744254	But yeah, it it plays great.
3744254	3744894	It looks great.
3744894	3746015	It sounds great.
3746015	3746235	The
3748227	3754913	I mean, if I didn't know better, I would have said I was playing the PlayStation version.
3754913	3764521	And it really did load very quickly, but I have to say I had a ping of nostalgia the moment I saw the Konami logo walking out.
3764521	3766843	I remember that.
3768274	3770635	Oh man, I haven't played Symphony of the Night in years.
3770635	3771196	I really need to.
3771196	3778440	I actually, I got a random PlayStation collection that had that and I want to say it was Dracula.
3778440	3779741	Yeah, there was that.
3779741	3783163	There was like a combo collection that I got on PlayStation.
3783163	3784404	I never did beat Symphony of the Night.
3784404	3785844	I need to go back and do that.
3785844	3788626	On PlayStation, they did the PSP one.
3788626	3791568	And then they've released it since then, I think on other things.
3791568	3796551	Yeah, I think that PSP version is now on PlayStation 4 or whatever.
3797580	3798820	Yeah.
3798820	3809884	And I know that you can play the remastered Dracula X and the original Dracula X, which is really great.
3809884	3811745	Dracula X was a great game.
3811745	3819127	In my mind, it's one of the last really traditional Castlevania games.
3819127	3820048	But yeah.
3823328	3827672	I just remember being so excited about the Saturn version and being able to play as Maria.
3839702	3845868	All of her magic is actually related back to her animal friend attacks.
3845868	3850952	Like, she has the turtle for Genbu, the turtle god.
3850952	3855777	I mean, hey, and you really know these if you watch Fushigi Yuugi, just saying!
3855777	3863083	You have Byakko for the tiger attack, you have Seiryu for a dragon attack, and...
3864945	3866707	You know what's so funny?
3866707	3869629	Those are all- Suzaku for the Phoenix attack, sorry.
3869629	3875235	Suzaku, Seiryo, Byakko, those are all fights in Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood expansion content.
3875235	3876936	Those are all like new primals.
3876936	3877717	Yeah, it's funny.
3877717	3881221	But they're also, you know, mythical beings.
3881221	3883082	I know.
3883082	3886386	I guess more of my point was they get reused in video game media.
3886386	3886546	Yeah.
3887589	3890030	Oh, anime, video games, you name it.
3890030	3892512	They're a major part of a part of things.
3892512	3897995	And you'll even see, you know, sometimes it sneaks over into American stuff, too.
3897995	3909381	But but yeah, this is and I will go ahead and say this, if anyone is looking for this, it's available through Internet Archive right now.
3909381	3912022	But talk to me.
3912022	3913163	All right.
3913163	3913443	We will.
3914042	3915863	I'm not saying anything about what I'm going to do.
3915863	3919285	I'll just, you know, draw on it with you, but talk to me.
3919285	3920926	All right.
3920926	3923148	Moving on, Loki.
3923148	3924128	All right.
3924128	3931953	So Sony has been fined by the France regulatory government body that basically regulates competition there.
3931953	3934175	I'm not going to try to pronounce that French name.
3934175	3936396	Not one bit.
3936396	3938658	And they have been fined 13.5 million euros.
3941739	3948503	for deploying technical countermeasures which affect proper functionality of third-party video game controllers.
3948503	3953126	Essentially, what they did is they basically blocked third-party controllers from working on the PlayStation 5.
3953126	3959549	Or I guess this is PlayStation 4 compatible controllers they're talking about now.
3959549	3963412	So, yeah, that sounds like, you know,
3964622	3970688	Now, I know Microsoft, we just talked about them a few weeks ago doing something similar.
3970688	3975032	I'm curious to see if this type of ruling comes down to them as well.
3975032	3988425	But basically, you know, along with deploying the technical countermeasures, they said that those measures were disproportionate in the fact that they were affecting all unlicensed controllers indiscriminately.
3988425	3989666	So Sony wasn't like saying,
3989986	3994331	Hey, we approve this one, we don't approve this one, you know, that type of thing.
3994331	4010847	So it is to say that because also they were their opaque licensing policy in which several cases prevented rival companies that wanted to market PlayStation 4 compatible controllers from joining its OLP partnership program.
4013632	4021417	So it's like they tried to go the official route, they went the unofficial route, and they still got banned for it.
4021417	4026340	So they're like, well, how am I supposed to create peripherals then for the PlayStation 4?
4026340	4030342	Guess you can't, because Sony wants to sell those first-party controllers.
4030342	4032884	At least they're going to do so with now a fine.
4038757	4045220	I wonder what kind of trickle down effect this might have on what's going on at Microsoft because didn't we just have that story?
4045220	4045920	Yeah, we did.
4045920	4056145	Two months ago when they were locking out third party controllers and we even had a call about that because remember our listener that had that really awesome custom controller they were taking all around EVO and all that stuff that.
4056145	4056646	Right.
4056646	4056846	Yeah.
4057685	4068954	It would depend on how they like, I think if it they would look at the two different factors of this one, how does their prevention of unlicensed products?
4068954	4071035	How is that affecting like everything?
4071035	4074438	Is it affecting some of the unlicensed things?
4074438	4077400	Or is it all of the unlicensed things?
4077400	4078761	Also, on top of that,
4079955	4086259	How hard is it to get into their partnership program to develop third-party controllers?
4086259	4102368	Now, I think the scope, I don't really know what defense Sony did as far as saying something along the lines of what Microsoft was saying where they're using this to combat people using keyboard and mouse on a console.
4103900	4110865	versus, you know, a controller because it gives them an unfair advantage, I guess, in multiplayer games.
4110865	4132139	If it's that or if this sounds like on the Sony side that it was to prevent competition, which I think that they, you know, like a government body, like say in the United States or something, would be more consider considering competition versus, oh, it's unfair for some people, you know, in that space.
4132139	4133260	So we'd have to see
4134560	4142224	I mean, I can see since they won this that, yeah, maybe they will try to do something like this when Microsoft pushes this forward.
4142224	4146066	It just depends on how draconian their implementation of it is.
4146066	4148748	If it's just, nothing works, then...
4150089	4160893	Maybe, but I think that there are still some approved third-party peripherals out there for the Xbox series.
4160893	4162313	There are.
4162313	4164954	So that may be a harder argument to make.
4164954	4165875	Interesting.
4165875	4166655	Okay.
4166655	4166975	We'll see.
4168304	4180729	Meanwhile, over at Nintendo, there was an interesting interview with The Guardian, who did an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, of course, the man behind Mario and many of the Nintendo characters that you love.
4180729	4187371	And, you know, one may notice that Miyamoto is getting older, and people are wondering if he is going to retire.
4187371	4191433	So The Guardian just basically straight up asked him, do you have any plans at all to retire?
4191433	4194434	And Miyamoto said he has no plans to retire.
4195014	4198657	But he does say that he thinks about things in a five-year time span.
4198657	4199877	That's an interesting kind of answer.
4199877	4207363	He thinks about things in five-year blocks, and sometimes he thinks about who he can pass things on to in case something happens.
4207363	4215729	So he says he has no plans to retire, but he says, more so than retiring, I'm thinking about the day I fall over, which he says with a smile.
4215729	4218371	So he's kind of cracking a morbid joke about
4219051	4226475	He'll probably die still working for Nintendo and saying, in this day and age, you have to think about things in a five year time span.
4226475	4230478	So I do think about who I can pass things on to in case something does happen.
4230478	4234760	I'm really thankful that there is so much energy around things that I have worked on.
4234760	4237282	These are things that have already gone out into the world.
4237282	4238943	They've been cultivated by others.
4238943	4241164	Other people have been raising them, helping them grow.
4241164	4244026	So in that sense, I don't feel too much ownership over them anymore.
4244386	4261715	You know, other people have kind of noticed that with Miyamoto, you know, it seems like he's probably spending less time actually in the active development of games and a little more time kind of pushing and being a face and a brand for Nintendo and expanding Nintendo back into those other things.
4261715	4266278	For example, the movie and the success of this Mario Brothers movie from the last year.
4266278	4269960	You know, Miyamoto did a lot with that partnership and making that Mario movie happen.
4270680	4273042	Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios.
4273042	4276744	Again, who was there from Nintendo the day that parked open?
4276744	4277565	Miyamoto.
4277565	4283969	You know, he's been very much a face, I think, in expanding Mario and Nintendo and stuff into these other areas.
4283969	4292114	And I'm not saying he's not involved with the video games at all, but I think when you look at him say a comment about, you put these things out in the world, they're being cultivated by others.
4292114	4297118	I think you sort of hear that, like, he hasn't trusted a lot of this game development to
4297998	4303853	his successors internally at Nintendo, and he's serving his characters and his creations in these other ways right now.
4303853	4305817	That's kind of one thing I sort of see there.
4306894	4312799	So Tigerclaw says, Do you think Miyamoto will still be developing games while in his 80s or 90s?
4312799	4315961	It's hard to say, and that's really his choice, not mine.
4315961	4319384	But I would think he'll still have something to say.
4319384	4326869	Like, even if he were to, say, retire from Nintendo, people are still going to want to put games in front of him to get his opinion.
4326869	4328170	What do you think about this?
4328170	4328871	What does your brain say?
4328871	4332674	Because he does that a lot with Nintendo properties as it is.
4333194	4337397	you know, he looks at games and maybe things go a certain way or they don't.
4337397	4346204	Like didn't didn't the Star Fox game on GameCube question mark start off as something else?
4346204	4346965	Yeah, wasn't it?
4346965	4348686	Was it Miyamoto that shifted it that way?
4348686	4349387	I don't remember.
4349387	4354771	But sometimes there are games that start as one thing and you know, it might be that his input it kind of shifts somewhere else.
4357495	4359416	But anyway, it's on his schedule.
4359416	4360836	It's for him to determine.
4360836	4365018	So I'm glad to see he still plans to keep working and so forth.
4365018	4365338	Yeah.
4365338	4371860	SJ100 Matt says, I hope he develops games as long as he wants and not told to keep making games by someone.
4371860	4373680	No, I would hope not.
4373680	4375801	I think he I think he's free to leave on his own.
4375801	4377242	It's Miyamoto, it's not Sakurai.
4380235	4382556	get in there make us another Smash Brothers.
4382556	4386217	SSJ100 Matt points out Miyazaki never seems to retire either.
4386217	4388318	So uh, yeah.
4388318	4390919	Fifth Dream says he even had input on Pokemon.
4390919	4391559	Yes.
4391559	4395060	So you know, people value the man's opinion greatly.
4395060	4398001	And I don't think that's ever going away.
4398001	4402983	What could be interesting though, just, I'm just gonna play silly for a minute.
4402983	4405344	If he were to retire and leave Nintendo,
4406448	4411832	He could give this input to games that weren't necessarily just Nintendo games.
4411832	4416816	That's true, but you know he's going to be Nintendo from, you know, life to death.
4416816	4419178	His heart will still be with Nintendo until the very end.
4419178	4419418	Absolutely.
4419418	4420379	The heart will go on.
4420379	4421760	Absolutely.
4421760	4422100	All right.
4422100	4425703	They're going to take it out of him and just leave it in the office for all to see.
4425703	4431347	See, here's what's going to happen is they're going to save Miyamoto's brain, Iwata's heart,
4432717	4441341	You know, they're, they probably have pieces preserved off of, um, uh, you've been playing too much Castlevania.
4441341	4445082	This is the plot of Simon's quest you're getting into.
4445082	4448844	I was, I was thinking more Frankenstein's monster, but yeah.
4448844	4449364	Yeah.
4449364	4452365	And then we will have ultimate Nintendo, man.
4452365	4453046	I'm with Matt.
4453046	4454026	This turned very dark.
4456400	4457240	It is me.
4457240	4459501	I mean, they already have done this.
4459501	4461141	What do you think Reggie Fils-Aimé is?
4461141	4464823	I mean, if that's not Frankenstein's monster, I don't know.
4464823	4467663	Yeah, Reggie's going to have that linebacker body.
4467663	4469424	That's the that's the body right there.
4469424	4471225	Like that was their first attempt.
4471225	4472885	Went pretty well, I think.
4472885	4475406	We're ready for version two already.
4475406	4476086	Oh, boy.
4476086	4483668	Actually, they'll take Miyamoto and Sakurai and split the brains together and they'll have the adjoined brain and the adjoined heart.
4483668	4485349	They'll have two hearts like like the doctor.
4487935	4488916	The more organs, the more human.
4505174	4507294	Yes, I agree with this.
4507294	4507835	All right.
4507835	4512496	I am changing the topic, but I'm changing the topic by saying, please go to our next topic, DarkSakura.
4512496	4513456	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
4513456	4515156	SSJ100 Matt has the best line.
4515156	4521018	They have to freeze all of them to battle with the future return of Segata Sanshiro.
4521018	4522918	Segata Sanshiro.
4522918	4525058	I hate it here.
4525058	4525899	You know you love it.
4525899	4527499	I do.
4527499	4531480	OK, so we're all about accessibility here.
4532321	4532963	I hope we are.
4532963	4533805	We better be.
4533805	4535189	We all need to take people.
4535189	4535791	Of course.
4542339	4555924	are a lot of strides being taken toward better accessibility in games and Harada Katsuhiro has listed some details about Tekken 8's accessibility mode.
4555924	4562986	He has tweeted saying, I have developed and tested an accessibility version of Tekken 7, albeit not for sale, several years ago.
4562986	4566228	The studies have been introduced into this version of Tekken 8.
4567989	4573779	And it basically has different colorblind accessibility modes.
4573779	4578688	Like you can play your characters in black and white.
4579736	4598843	with them being horizontal black and white bars and the other being vertical black and white bars, sort of 2D over 3D, blue and yellow characters over an inverted black and white background, even with different color filters over it to retain the 3D.
4598843	4608347	I'll be perfectly honest, a lot of looking at this is very overstimulating for me personally, because there's so much going on, like,
4609518	4609870	You know...
4610856	4621344	Like the one that's really bugging me the most is, you know, have you ever taken just like a, like a full on normal 3d picture and then try to put it into a vector program?
4621344	4624627	How it just reduces everything like to line vector.
4624627	4626088	And it just does not do a great job.
4626088	4627469	It's just these random.
4627469	4631252	Quigley blurs and shapes, you know, that vaguely look like stuff.
4631252	4632753	That's what one of them looks like to me.
4632753	4637357	And I'm just like, um, I cannot, please, please, brain does not compute.
4637357	4639859	But for, but I would imagine for people.
4641298	4646021	that need this kind of visual interface.
4646021	4648302	Sorry.
4648302	4652064	That for them, you know, this is this is definitely a big step.
4652064	4655445	I mean, people are already saying that.
4655445	4665290	And I'm going to be perfectly honest, of course, the majority of of people who deal with colorblindness are going to be predominantly
4669304	4676126	assigned male at birth, I'll say, born with that genetic predisposition toward it.
4676126	4683828	But even so, I can see how some of this would be good also for people with other conditions, too.
4683828	4696951	For example, people with poor eyesight might be able to play with that yellow and blue mode and have a better opportunity to see the characters or people with
4698211	4700733	Focus Issues, and Laura Bliss!
4700733	4702354	Welcome in!
4702354	4705656	Sorry.
4705656	4708358	I had to say so as one of my streamer friends.
4708358	4710160	Welcome in.
4710160	4711901	But to go back to what I was talking about,
4713278	4724100	Um, the, uh, the demo showing this off is, it's already there, um, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and PC.
4724100	4729781	And Bandai Namco is releasing the full game on January 26, 2024.
4729781	4735562	And I wouldn't doubt that there'll be, uh, other aspects to this built into it.
4735562	4737402	So that's really good.
4737402	4737642	Yeah.
4737642	4740823	Fifth Dream says, I have issues with following too much movement.
4740823	4741723	This could help maybe.
4743942	4754666	It's very interesting to see all the way these games are innovating in accessibility, you know, it was commented in chat, Dr. Tsuya said Mortal Kombat 1 and Street Fighter 6 did some cool stuff with accessibility as well.
4754666	4763590	Yeah, I remember like the descriptive fatalities in Mortal Kombat 1, you know, there's there's been a lot of creativity in the accessibility realm with fighting games.
4763590	4764431	It's pretty cool to see.
4764431	4767392	So it's nice that Tekken is kind of continuing that trend.
4767392	4767832	It's pretty cool.
4771523	4785189	I want to see games offer more ways to play with switch control, for example, or with eye tracking.
4785189	4788250	If they can get the eye tracking down a lot better,
4789486	4793068	then I see a lot of potential in that.
4793068	4804074	I've used a couple of different eye-tracking devices to control things, I'd say over the last year or so, and it's getting better.
4804074	4809237	I really see games opening up to more people.
4809237	4810978	PlayStation VR, too, does that.
4810978	4813099	It's very fascinating, yeah.
4813099	4813299	Cool.
4814773	4823159	Alright, moving on, on a completely different note, I don't know how to transition to this topic, Loki, but it's something people are talking about!
4823159	4830043	Yeah, it's the final, final recent act in the three-part act.
4830043	4832045	The third revision to Twitch's DanceOn.
4832045	4837528	Yeah, the three-part act that is the Twitch allowing artistic nudity.
4837528	4839710	The climax, if you will.
4839710	4842932	Yes, so now, now they don't.
4842932	4843832	Or at least, they don't.
4845314	4862249	People once again keep trying to skirt by the rules in different ways, so one of the new metas was this implied nudity meta, so basically they were putting black bars across different areas of their body even though they were clothed underneath.
4862890	4863470	No Austin Powers.
4891272	4892213	No Austin Powers.
4892213	4892713	I'm sorry.
4892713	4896155	Austin Powers banned and banned from Twitch.
4896155	4898216	I hope you all know what I'm referencing in that movie.
4898216	4905619	The infamous scene where the continuous objects are covering up the body parts that are otherwise implied nude.
4905619	4908541	But I believe they wanted to keep that movie at a PG-13 rate.
4908541	4909822	Maybe it is rated R. I don't know.
4909822	4911683	But yeah.
4911683	4915785	And then they did the same fucking joke in the sequel, if I remember right.
4915785	4916845	In all of the movies.
4916845	4917746	Yeah, of course they did.
4917746	4919006	Of course they did.
4919006	4920047	No Austin Powersing.
4920965	4925731	Yeah, so does that make the trailer for the latest Yakuza game legal then?
4925731	4927974	Because it kind of did the same thing.
4928615	4929936	I think games are different.
4929936	4935141	I don't think it necessarily applies to games.
4935141	4937923	I think that was one of the things that they did call out on it.
4937923	4949393	I'm trying to see... Right, because you don't get banned for playing Baldur's Gate 3 if you just brush by that part of the... and I mean that part of the character creator.
4949393	4952855	You know, I'm sure if you were, you know, spending hours and hours, you know,
4954161	4954501	Thank you
4975854	5004968	it says for those who present as women we we ask you to that you cover your cover your nipples and do not expose underbust cleavage is unrestricted as long as the coverage requirements are met and in the bolded and it is clear that the streamer is wearing clothing no under boob that's what they're saying right no under save save that for the what was the hot tub pools hot tubs and beaches they know what that category is come on like come on
5005819	5010625	Um, yeah, it'll be a mess until the next meta comes out.
5010625	5013650	And then they do something else.
5013650	5020780	They roll it back again, because someone will find a way to do something mirrors or at least smoke in mirrors, you know?
5022882	5028046	I don't envy the people trying to police the content on Twitch because this is exactly what happens.
5028046	5038695	You make the rules one way and people push the envelope as far as they can, but then if you make a rule that's too much, then people complain that you're doing too much.
5039435	5062216	it's still like it's still ridiculous anyways because you know they the rules that they have right now regarding like wearing bikinis and stuff like that they're like well only if it's a hot tub stream and so they will count it as a hot tub stream if you have a kiddie pool in your your bedroom or something like that that's counted because there's a there's a tub in view
5062876	5086076	or something like that even though clearly we're gonna do a hot tub not not we I wouldn't loop you all in this but we were gonna do a hot tub stream as a VOG point reward because Grandpa Warcraft or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling has a hot tub up at his up at his cabin so I was like oh wait do you have do you have fast internet out here we could do a hot tub stream talking about World of Warcraft that'd be fun yeah it's just I don't know it's
5087202	5095889	It's weird, but it's it's because they don't have a dedicated adult category is why you have it seeping into everything.
5095889	5105257	And honestly, like, because they don't crack down on it, like that's why it's still pervasive, because they're making tons of money off of it, probably.
5105257	5112963	And until someone calls them out, or their, you know, advertising partners call them out on it, they're not gonna do anything.
5114551	5115091	You know what's funny?
5115091	5119515	TigerKlaw in chat says, remember when Twitch used to be about gaming and now look at this mess.
5119515	5122698	They should have kept JustinTV for all the real life stuff.
5122698	5125881	You might remember, go back to the episode right after TwitchCon.
5125881	5134548	I went to a panel with the old JustinTV founders and some of the new faces at Twitch as well that are, and I actually asked a question.
5134548	5140954	It wasn't, I don't think this was streamed on Twitch or anything, so you had to be in the room, but I actually asked a question and I said some of the effect of like,
5142014	5150598	How did that journey happen where JustinTV was about real life stuff and then it kind of pivoted to Twitch and then it went back to basically doing real life stuff but now on Twitch?
5150598	5157760	And in short, the answer I got was basically, it never really was intended to go away that you weren't supposed to be doing like real life or whatever.
5157760	5159381	It was always just a marketing thing, basically.
5160181	5164084	that they knew the audience was there with the video games and that kind of helped them get back.
5164084	5165385	Anyway, go listen.
5165385	5168167	The answer was better fresh in my mind on that episode.
5168167	5171809	So you have to go back and listen to that episode after TwitchCon where I detailed it better.
5171809	5176152	But I asked about that to the people that you would ask that about, too.
5176152	5178694	So it's a bummer that wasn't streamed online.
5179551	5180572	to my knowledge.
5180572	5181813	All right.
5181813	5187879	Let's talk about this because this is something that I think a lot of people would be very excited about.
5187879	5190741	And that would be a Chrono Trigger sequel.
5190741	5193003	No one hasn't been announced.
5193003	5197828	But you know, this is the time of year where we're doing a lot of interviews with folks.
5197828	5199029	So Yuji Horii
5199509	5204913	Hironobu Sakaguchi and Kazuhiko Torishima recently got together in person.
5204913	5209957	This is the first time in 30 years, apparently, that they got together in person to have a chat.
5209957	5213799	And I think this was like a podcast or something that they were doing or a broadcast.
5213799	5222546	And they were talking about a Chrono Trigger 2, that this idea kind of came up, and it actually seemed like there was some interest in making the sequel happen.
5223086	5226329	But it's probably unlikely.
5226329	5230792	Torishima joked that it would be easy to do because Square Enix have now merged.
5230792	5238518	Sakaguchi was not quite as sure, but all three devs said they'd like to work on a small game with a small team.
5238518	5242141	Sakaguchi said, let's make a simple Chrono Trigger 2.
5242141	5246244	But then they kind of were joking about they want to make something for Switch or mobile.
5246244	5249046	Chrono Trigger 2 would probably end up becoming much bigger.
5249586	5253491	And they do admit it would be difficult to see them doing Chrono Trigger 2.
5253491	5258316	If they ever did make something together again, they'd want to do something brand new.
5258316	5262600	But what's interesting, and Fifth Dream, you're spoiling the punchline, but that's okay.
5262600	5264242	I understand the story's been going around.
5265208	5266449	a lot this week.
5266449	5275654	They actually started talking about Sea of Stars, which, as you know, is a new kind of indie game that's very inspired by Chrono Trigger.
5275654	5277115	Sea of Stars has been very greatly influenced.
5277115	5280837	Well, sure enough, these guys know about this game.
5280837	5283198	Horii said the devs did a great job.
5283198	5285119	It looks just like Chrono Trigger.
5285119	5292963	Torishima found the game to be nostalgic, and Sakaguchi said, look, it's the same, and said the devs really did their best and did a great job.
5292963	5293824	Is that Toriyama?
5295168	5296189	Kazuhiko Torishima
5320157	5331070	All right, let's move on and get to since we're taking a retro time back through time, let's let's spotlight something in our next segment.
5331070	5337497	But by the way, I do quickly want to mention, you know, we are taping a podcast, but occasionally I have to acknowledge what's going on live.
5337897	5342541	Since Jamie already did that earlier, I will also say thank you for the hype train.
5342541	5345364	Y'all have a random ass hype train going on in chat right now.
5345364	5345925	Thank you for that.
5345925	5347626	That's very sweet of you to do.
5347626	5350228	What a hell of a way to start off 2024.
5350228	5355673	So why don't we, why don't we bring you this segment that you've been waiting for to kick off the year?
5355673	5355994	Here we go.
5366661	5374416	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5374416	5376961	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5378630	5385914	All right, and wait, before I switch to what the game is, DarkSakura, were you inspired at all by Orange, right, on this?
5385914	5387434	Because I feel like you might have been.
5387434	5391496	Or, no, it's Dungeon Buster, I'm sorry, that does this on socials.
5391496	5392177	Oh.
5392177	5394738	Oh, OK, because he posts about these games a lot.
5394738	5396259	Anyway, OK, I just I had to know.
5396259	5399280	Well, what was your inspiration for this week's pick?
5399280	5404062	I did this because I already did the original Baldur's Gate.
5404062	5405383	Oh, OK, got it, got it.
5405383	5405643	All right.
5405643	5406984	Well, what is the classic game of the week then?
5408177	5409899	It's Pool of Radiance!
5409899	5413802	Another T&D game.
5413802	5422470	So, Pool of Radiance was published in 1988 by Strategic Simulations Inc.
5424012	5427394	You know, from the advanced Dungeons and Dragons.
5427394	5435480	This was in the heyday of second edition still, which is still best edition.
5435480	5442485	And it was the first adaptation of AD&D for home computers.
5442485	5450911	And it was the first episode in a four part series for Pool of Radiance.
5450911	5451172	They
5452566	5459789	The other games came in a gold box series that used the engine that was pioneered in Pool of Radiance.
5459789	5465471	Also, as did later D&D titles like Neverwinter Nights online game.
5465471	5474794	And it takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting and mostly centered around the city of Flan, a port city.
5474794	5481197	So you start off with a party of up to six characters, you know, decide, you know, what bits are in their pants.
5482130	5487715	what people they come from, what their class is, and what their stats are.
5487715	5497743	And then you have to go help the part of the city by clearing out bandits and other forces around.
5497743	5507812	And you move from area, from one to the other, and basically you're just doing your campaign and you get your experience points like you do in standard D&D.
5509073	5512834	and you can increase your stats for different capabilities.
5512834	5521937	It is a first-person game and the screen is divided into sections that show information that's useful to you.
5521937	5529299	And then, of course, during combat it goes to top-down, quote, video game isometric view, end quote.
5531002	5535105	We're going to go into a little bit more of the gameplay.
5535105	5553215	And for those who are here with us live on Twitch at VOG Network, you can see it, you know, going through the various characters and it has that classic first person, you know, sprite based going down, you know, turn the corner.
5553215	5557258	If you've played Phantasy Star, you know what I'm talking about.
5559339	5576837	So, you can make your own party, you can use a generated party for those new to it, and you have two slots also for NPCs, non-player characters.
5576837	5577538	You can
5579740	5584922	For some versions, they had ways that you could save them on your disk drive.
5584922	5590324	On others, you would have to have a save disk, like Commodore 64 used to save disks.
5590324	5595426	If you're playing the DOS version, it definitely saved to the internal.
5595426	5604530	So basically, your exploration mode, as I was mentioning earlier, has that three-dimensional first-person perspective with a rectangle in the top left of the screen.
5605430	5609854	displaying what the party is looking at.
5609854	5618662	You have different menus, you can see your attributes, you can see character sheets, you can see all kinds of stuff.
5618662	5628351	You have three different versions of each sprite as well to differentiate short, medium, and long range encounters.
5628351	5630773	You've got your spell list, you have all kinds of stuff.
5631833	5647159	Um, and of course, as I said, it goes to a top-down, uh, diametric, uh, view, uh, projection, where you can look at where the characters are, put them in the right place, talk strategy, all of that.
5647159	5652801	Um, and then, of course, you get an extra attack when enemies are retreating, which I think is awesome.
5652801	5656643	It's the, let me stab you in the back on your way out, or the door hit you in the ass.
5657743	5666970	If a character's HP falls below zero, then you have to be bandaged by another character or you die.
5666970	5674876	The game has random encounters, of course, and Dragon Magazine, which
5676238	5688182	If you don't remember Dragon Magazine, it was the magazine for all things D&D, fantasy universe, you named it.
5688182	5692123	Lots of good tie-ins with various TSR properties.
5694998	5712608	but one of their game reviewers said that the random encounters follow the standard patterns for encounter tables in tabletop D&D manuals and that the monster depictions basically were exactly what they were in the monster manual.
5714048	5716750	So you've got different combat options based on your class.
5716750	5730058	So fighters can do melee or ranged magic, users cast spells, thieves have backstab, sneak, fight, you know, basically, you just keep going, you know, normal, normal stuff.
5730058	5737963	Of course, for spellcasters, you have to spend time nightly to memorize your spells.
5740164	5746488	As you go through, you get XP and you can level up to become more powerful.
5746488	5749950	It had some interesting copy protection in it.
5749950	5756775	The DOS, Mac, and Apple II versions of Pool of Radiance had a two-ply code wheel.
5756775	5762698	You know, like those old decoders that you would get in your cereal boxes back in the day when people still gave a shit about decoders?
5762698	5765420	I feel like some Sierra games had the wheels too.
5765420	5766781	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5766781	5767802	LucasArts did a lot.
5769737	5776459	It was used for translating Elvish and Dwarven runes, and some Dwarven runes had different translations.
5776459	5789023	But on the title screen, it would come up with two runes in a varying line, like dotted, dashed, or whatever, that corresponded to the markings on your code wheel.
5789023	5793764	And you would enter a five or six character code that corresponded to all of that.
5797757	5802918	then that would be how you would unlock the game for use.
5802918	5810760	Also, in the DOS version, Pool of Radiance, the code wheel is used for some in-game puzzles.
5810760	5818482	In the NES version, the Elvish words are given to you deciphered, so you don't have a code wheel for the NES version.
5818482	5820503	But basically,
5823689	5830958	In the land of Flan, you're on the Moonsea shore.
5830958	5840050	And basically, you're starting a new Flan, an area of that, and just basically having to protect the city and help it grow and, you know.
5840550	5847574	work for them and you have different gods in the city and their temples can heal you depending on how you are.
5847574	5852396	Some of them require money, because of course they do.
5852396	5856518	You also can hire NPCs to go with the party.
5856518	5868164	So it is, you know, you go to the tavern and listen to gossip and drink and it's like...
5869082	5870765	Am I in the tavern?
5870765	5872227	Yeah, you're in the tavern.
5872227	5874331	Cool, I get drunk.
5874331	5876535	That too.
5876535	5880121	If there's any chicks there, I want to do them.
5880121	5880501	Yeah.
5882350	5893098	So, but basically, going back to a little bit of history on the game, and I know I have been talking at length about this already, but this game is very important in gaming history.
5893098	5897721	It was, again, the first official game based off AD&D rules.
5897721	5910350	The scenario was created by TSR designers Jim Ward, David Cook, Steve Winter, and Mike Brault, I always mispronounce his name, and then the programmers from SSI's team.
5912044	5923915	And the game was created on an Apple II and Commodore 64 computers in one year with a team of 35 people.
5923915	5930301	It was the first to use this game engine known as the Gold Box.
5930301	5935946	And it really followed quite well the AD&D rules, the second edition rules.
5938496	5945778	It used a lot of the Unearthed Arcana and the Monster Manual 2 that was used in development.
5945778	5961343	And, honestly enough, you know, the Pool of Radiance series, not only did it come out originally on Commodore 64, Apple II series, and IBM PCs, it came out on Atari ST.
5961343	5962924	There was a Mac version in 1989.
5964424	5972990	They had a slightly different interface and was meant to also work on black and white Macs like the Mac Plus and Mac Classic.
5972990	5974751	Different tiles.
5974751	5978333	There was an Amiga version that came out.
5978333	5983396	PC-9800 version.
5983396	5987079	It was fully translated in Japanese and had full-color graphics.
5987079	5991702	It was ported to the NES under the title Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Pool of Radiance.
5991702	5992342	It came out in April 1992.
5994424	6004271	The NES version had a full soundtrack that was composed by Toda Seiji, who was signed to Pony Canyon.
6004271	6009255	The soundtrack was also on the PC-9801 version.
6009255	6011597	The Amiga version had some extra music.
6013258	6032025	but the game shipped with a 28 page booklet that described some secrets in playing the game and concepts behind it and it had, you know, just showed you how to create the party and also had a 38 page adventurer's journal which gave more background on the game
6033065	6035986	had maps and all kinds of information.
6035986	6051472	It did spawn three direct sequels, Curse of the Azure Bonds in 89, Secrets of the Silver Blades in 1990, and Pools of Darkness in 1991, which I think is the one maybe most people know of as Pools of Darkness.
6051472	6058334	1989 game Hillsfar was also made by SSI, but not a sequel to Pool of Radiance, but it was inspired.
6062785	6066628	It was very detailed and very amazing for its day.
6066628	6078156	You know, keep in mind, these games were at the time being run on like Pentium, I think it was a Pentium 2, Pentium 3 around the time.
6078156	6082400	No, it had to have been a Pentium 2.
6082400	6084781	Anyway, I have to go look at my history again.
6084781	6086463	It's all about the Pentiums, baby.
6088883	6101447	Well, um, in 1988, uh, the module Ruins of Adventure was created using the same scenario for Pool of Radiance, same plot background setting, you name it.
6101447	6109629	And so the module also gave clues to completing the computer missions.
6109629	6117792	And so the Ruins of Adventure had four linked mini scenarios, which were the core Pool of Radiance and then, um,
6119429	6137552	Drakken said that Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, not vice versa, but Mike Brouillat stated that they were chosen directly to write for Pool of Radiance, and so the game came first.
6137552	6146974	In 1989, there's a novelization of Pool of Radiance that was called Pool of Radiance, published by TSR in their Forgotten Realms series.
6149870	6154876	It was the first in a trilogy, there was Pools of Darkness and Pool of Twilight.
6154876	6164007	GOG has released Pool of Radiance and many of the Gold Box games digitally on August 20, 2015 as part of the Forgotten Realms, the Archives.
6164007	6166190	Steam also released Pool of Radiance in 2022.
6170835	6186296	SSI sold 264,536 copies for North America when it came out, and that was three times that of Heroes of the Lance, which was, I believe, the Dragonlance one, I'd have to say.
6186724	6189546	Yeah, this is the Dragonlance campaign.
6189546	6194749	And the hint book outsold any earlier game.
6194749	6197870	It really was very well received.
6197870	6201112	Dragon Magazine gave it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.
6201112	6203113	Amiga Action, 79%.
6203113	6205615	Commodore User, 9 out of 10.
6205615	6213580	So, it also won an Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988.
6217762	6222045	There were some mixed reviews for some of the other versions.
6222045	6230931	Some people just didn't care for having it on a computer to begin with, and that colored their review.
6230931	6234473	They also found that there were speed issues.
6234473	6241438	The DOS version was really fast, so much that they had to slow the game down to be able to read on-screen messages.
6241918	6252787	The DOS version played at twice the speed of Commodore 64 or 128 version when using the EGA graphics mode.
6252787	6255529	But I mean, there's a lot more history about it.
6255529	6257451	It won so many awards.
6257451	6261594	It really was something that set the pace.
6261594	6269441	And in 1990, it received the fifth highest number of votes in the survey of computer gaming world all time favorites.
6270402	6278926	It has been ranked by IGN as number 3 on their list of top 11 Dungeons & Dragons games of all time in 2014.
6278926	6284808	And honestly, it really did set the pace, you know?
6284808	6286649	I think the big thing that
6288252	6294316	Yeah, the big one that I played was Pool of Radiance, Ruins of Mithdranor.
6294316	6303763	I played a lot of that one, and I have, like, the... Well, actually, I think I loaned the manual to somebody, and I don't know where it is now.
6303763	6308406	But I had, like, the full box set that came with the player's guide and everything.
6308406	6311268	So, I love that they were able to put these things together.
6313430	6316171	And that's it, the one that started it, Pool of Radiance.
6316171	6316912	All right.
6316912	6317392	Great pick.
6317392	6319893	And hey, I remember my Thaco.
6319893	6320273	That's right.
6320273	6328537	You can see Thaco on the screen, as Bobbi's pointing out, and some of the kind of transitions as they're walking around and managing their inventory and doing all this.
6328537	6330778	I'll translate for the babies.
6330778	6332859	To hit armor class zero.
6334640	6346943	Alright, Pool of Radiance, your classic game of the week, and really one of the all-time classics, to be quite honest, picking a heck of a thing to start off 2024.
6346943	6353564	Alright, we're gonna check out some other news very quick, and then we just have a couple other headlines here.
6353564	6363526	It's still pretty early in the year, so we don't have a ton of news, but there's been a bit to catch up on over the past couple weeks, so we still have just a few more things, including some quick headlines, and we will start with Loki.
6364502	6379650	Yeah, speaking of something tangentially related to Dungeons & Dragons, I mean, I guess it is technically Dungeons & Dragons, but Baldur's Gate 3, folks are getting banned, or I should say, getting, having their clips flagged on Xbox.
6381431	6384932	if they contain, you know, some spicy gameplay in there.
6384932	6393795	So now Lorian Studios has worked with Microsoft to get those clips unbanned.
6393795	6407359	And in the meantime, they said that if you want to upload any clips, make sure to turn off mature content so that, you know, it doesn't come across and you don't have your account be in jeopardy there.
6408494	6412595	Oh, I had to unpublish mine because I accidentally showed bits.
6412595	6420316	I will also on a somewhat related but funny note that I saw come across social media, because, you know, Awesome Games Done Quick is coming up next week.
6420316	6422656	So there's speed runs, lots of speed runs.
6422656	6426897	One speed run you will not be seeing there is the one that I just saw on YouTube.
6426897	6431278	And that was a it was a sex run in Baldur's Gate.
6431278	6435479	And it was somebody unlocking sex as fast as they could in the game.
6435479	6437339	And I think it was like two minutes.
6438476	6439376	I think they got it done.
6439376	6445197	I think they got sex in under two minutes, which is how long some guys last.
6445197	6448658	Anyway.
6448658	6453399	So, uh, Game Pass, adding some new games in January, obviously.
6453399	6458300	So some of the games coming to Game Pass this month, we have Hell Let Loose.
6458300	6461781	That's on cloud PC and the Xbox series.
6461781	6463421	Assassin's Creed Valhalla.
6466212	6485216	Figment, SuperMegaBaseball4, WeHappyFew, Resident Evil 2, Those Who Remain, Dead by Daylight, Chucky Update, Hello Neighbor 2 Anniversary, Sea of Thieves Season 10
6494972	6497114	It comes and goes.
6497114	6507926	And then Garden Story, MotoGP 22, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 3 Portable are also leaving this month as well.
6507926	6510108	All right.
6510108	6510489	DarkSakura.
6513083	6518386	So, um, oh goodness, I had the frog in my throat.
6518386	6533754	Um, so we have the next, uh, Stern Pinball release, and that's going to be da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
6537449	6563190	Anyway, there's going to be a little bit more information coming out, but right now they've just made their big... They're going to be showing more off between January 9th and 12th at the Consumer Electronics Expo in Las Vegas.
6563190	6564351	I kind of want to be there.
6568318	6573435	People are already sure that it's already in production, so we'll see what happens.
6575842	6577322	All right.
6577322	6585885	And one more story for you is about a classic game that dates all the way back to the Atari Lynx is being redone for the Nintendo Switch.
6585885	6587805	It's Chips Challenge.
6587805	6588806	Oh, I remember Chips.
6588806	6589506	Yeah, that's right.
6589506	6599169	It came out originally in 1989 for the Atari Lynx, and it's going to be coming out on January 25th, 2024 for the Nintendo Switch.
6599169	6601009	It's the classic puzzle game from 1989 with over 140 levels.
6603710	6614293	This collection will let you play the classic game, but with new features, including display filters, such as LCD and CRT filters, save games, and then right and left-handed control presets.
6614293	6618854	You know, interesting fun fact, and I think I've mentioned this on the show before, I actually know the guy that made this game.
6618854	6626916	The original, Chuck is his name, he made this game on the Atari Lynx back in the day, and you know, this game's kind of been everywhere since then, because it had all these different ports.
6627636	6628457	Really nice guy.
6628457	6631959	He doesn't really... He's not really connected to video games.
6631959	6635101	He's not really connected with the gaming industry anymore.
6635101	6640124	He said to me some just things that I think he's just kind of not with it anymore.
6640124	6644447	But he does some really cool... He does a lot of cool, like, lighting stuff now, actually.
6644447	6646368	He does, like, exhibits for Burning Man.
6646368	6648069	And they've actually showed some of them downtown.
6648069	6652792	If you saw, like, that light wall by the Golden One downtown last year, it was up for a few months.
6652792	6653492	He did that.
6653492	6655494	So he does a lot of really cool light exhibits now.
6655494	6655954	So it's kind of...
6656714	6666184	I guess maybe interesting kind of thing that here comes that game coming up again on the Nintendo Switch.
6666184	6667865	Some games last a very long time.
6667865	6669547	It's pretty cool.
6669547	6671188	All right, moving on.
6671188	6675473	Let's travel around the world and check out some other new games that are coming out in the coming week.
6675473	6679737	Although I don't know if there will be a lot this early in the year, but I'll check in anyway.
6679737	6679977	Loki.
6680902	6687044	Yeah, and I was going to mention with Chip's Challenge, the thing, I didn't remember this from the actual Atari Lynx.
6687044	6691866	I actually got it with the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.
6691866	6693407	Remember that?
6693407	6693867	I do.
6693867	6696048	I think that's how a lot of people played it, to be honest.
6696667	6699228	Exactly, so this is pretty cool.
6699228	6701629	Yeah, we have a few things coming out this week.
6701629	6708571	Not a whole lot, but we have, looks like Laika, Aged Through Blood on Nintendo Switch.
6708571	6712513	Momodora, Moonlit Farewell on PC.
6713733	6721495	The Top Racer Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6721495	6725936	War Hospital on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6725936	6730197	Crystal Story, Dawn of Dusk on PC.
6730197	6732598	And that actually is it.
6734871	6739754	Alright, well let's head over to Japan and check out the releases coming out there.
6739754	6741674	I don't think we have an awful lot this week.
6741674	6744496	Well, actually we have a little bit on the 11th.
6744496	6755141	We have Gungrave Gore, that's G-O-R-E, is coming out on the Nintendo Switch in Enhanced Edition and Limited Edition, because you know we love our Limited Editions and such in Japan.
6755821	6760023	Also, Football Manager coming out in Japan on January the 12th.
6760023	6763044	So that is what you have to look forward to on the Nintendo Switch.
6763044	6767566	On the PlayStation 5, that Football Manager game also being released in Japan.
6767566	6769447	That is really it.
6769447	6773088	What about Europe, DarkSakura?
6773088	6773909	One.
6773909	6775830	It's on PlayStation and Xbox.
6775830	6780592	It comes out the 11th, War Hospital Deluxe Edition.
6780592	6781332	Exciting.
6781332	6781512	Yeah.
6782657	6789140	All right, we have just a few more stories for you, and then we'll invite your comments and topics and all that good stuff.
6789140	6791761	But first, Loki's got a couple other headlines to talk about.
6791761	6793442	These are both kind of some big stories, too.
6793442	6794203	We want to make sure.
6794203	6796184	Yeah.
6796184	6798065	So.
6798065	6809970	We know that there's surprisingly coming out very soon, and I'm surprised we haven't seen anything about it yet, but the Minecraft movie is supposed to be coming out this year.
6813010	6819555	Actually, I think it may be pushed back a little bit later, but I thought it was coming out in March.
6819555	6821876	I guess it's pretty close.
6821876	6823858	Why live action?
6823858	6824638	I don't know.
6824638	6827501	It just sounds awful as a live action movie.
6827501	6832984	Remember that they had casted Jason Momoa in it for some reason.
6832984	6838408	And now Jack Black is set to play Steve in the Minecraft movie.
6839864	6842885	I don't know how, like, like, don't get me wrong.
6842885	6844685	I like Jack Black.
6844685	6850966	He would work as as an animated movie would work as him playing Steve.
6850966	6854787	I do not see him as a Steve in a live action Minecraft.
6854787	6858648	It just doesn't feel like it makes any sense.
6858648	6860028	You know what, Loki, it could have been worse.
6860028	6862448	It could have been Timothee Chalamet or something like that.
6862448	6865549	So, you know, Jack Black, I think they could have done a lot worse.
6866736	6868077	I don't know.
6868077	6870499	I think he'll bring enthusiasm to the role, though.
6870499	6871820	I mean, sure.
6871820	6873802	He'll have a respect for the source material.
6873802	6881988	It's just like, it's one of those things like the idea of a Minecraft movie, like an animated movie, makes a whole ton of sense to me.
6881988	6885011	A live action Minecraft movie makes no sense to me.
6885011	6893377	And hearing Jack Black and Jason Momoa makes me think of like the new Jumanji type thing where it's like, oh, we got sucked into a video game type thing.
6893377	6893678	And like,
6894418	6918818	I certainly hope that's not what it is because I mean one it's incredibly derivative and two it's Jack Black is in the Jumanji movie and that's the premise of that too so it's like okay you can't do that again I mean you can but like this was it I think this is a Warner Brothers movie too if I remember correctly so you're gonna cancel all those other movies but not this I mean I don't know we'll see
6921654	6930182	SSJ100 Matt going straight for the heart saying I raise your Timothee Chalamet with Jared Leto.
6930182	6934465	Do you know how Tron fans are grieving right now?
6934465	6937188	Do you know what it's like to be a Tron fan right now?
6937188	6939570	Well, yeah, Yuri's actor.
6942608	6944589	Well, there's that too.
6944589	6947089	That's also horrible news.
6947089	6951711	Yeah, she passed, but Jared Leto is going to be in the third movie.
6951711	6952771	What?
6952771	6953051	Yeah.
6953051	6954511	Oh, that came out a while ago.
6954511	6957172	You know, OK, here's the thing.
6957172	6961494	I actually don't really hate him so much in movies.
6961494	6962874	I think it's just cool to hate on him.
6964193	6966414	You just haven't watched his movies, have you?
6966414	6966774	I did.
6966774	6970696	I like, I actually was kind of into him as Joker in Suicide Squad.
6970696	6972376	Big fan of the Morbius.
6972376	6976398	We're way, we're way in distance from my so-called life now.
6976398	6980540	I just want to be clear.
6980540	6980840	All right.
6980840	6987803	Like, I didn't have a problem with him as Joker in, in the Suicide Squad movie, other than he didn't even need to be in the movie, but like.
6987803	6988603	True.
6988603	6993785	And then, then they just like, let's not pretend that movie ever happened and we'll just do it again, you know?
6994312	7005003	So, um... I don't know, like... I'll see it anyways, it's gonna be garbage, cause I gotta see whether it's gonna be garbage or not.
7005003	7008486	I mean... You're watching- you're waiting for the trainwreck to happen.
7008486	7009107	You're gonna hate watching it.
7009107	7012290	I am waiting for- I am gonna hate watching it, but like, yeah, it's just- it's...
7013447	7014948	I had to see a trailer of it.
7014948	7020231	Like it just right now, like, assuming that it's coming out... How is it coming out in March?
7020231	7022152	It sounds like they haven't even shot a frame of it yet.
7022152	7023413	That's impossible.
7023413	7023713	March 2025?
7023713	7028856	How much of it's going to be CG and green screen?
7028856	7030457	It was supposed to be pretty soon.
7033126	7035850	I would love a Tron movie for my birthday, but I don't know so much.
7049502	7051884	No, he's Matt still talking about Minecraft.
7051884	7060990	I don't know when the Tron one is being done, but they did after right after the writer's strike wrapped up or the I'm sorry, the actor's strike wrapped up.
7060990	7071257	They confirmed that because one of the big stories when the writer's strike happened was that they laid people off that were working on Tron because they were unable to finish it.
7071257	7073638	But then once they got that resolved, they're picking it up again.
7073638	7075139	And now they're making casting announcements.
7075139	7076640	So who's Jared Leto?
7076640	7079002	So it's a play in the Tron movie, like
7080302	7083024	I don't think Garrett Hedlund is back in it.
7083024	7088187	I think it's taking place in a completely different... I don't know.
7088187	7089568	I have concerns, but we'll see.
7089568	7094631	I will hate watch it just like Loki hate watches Minecraft because at least it's Tron.
7097152	7099695	There's no Daft Punk to do the score.
7114109	7119431	the Oasis from Ready Player One to make that.
7119431	7123952	Like, you're talking about a company, like, really, we're gonna trust Warner Brothers with this?
7123952	7128474	The company that, like, just eats up other companies and then cancels all their products and, like, all that stuff?
7128474	7130594	Like, are we really gonna do that?
7130594	7132315	One word, three letters.
7132315	7134636	Matrix MMO.
7134636	7135036	Flop.
7137203	7164873	it's also like it's like you don't like did you read the book like do you not recognize yourselves as IOI like the the company that's basically this big corporation looking to monetize the whole thing in the first place like of course not because they're everybody's looking at fortnite now and everybody wants to be the next fortnite yeah but what was the last good warner brothers game mortal kombat one yeah okay fine that's that's more nether realm that they're like you know like if
7167367	7169128	just any of their properties, though.
7169128	7176252	Other than that, I'm just some would say the wizard boy game.
7176252	7179294	It it sold it sold copies.
7179294	7188579	We'll just leave it at that, you know, but if I if I am to things happened in relation to it, if I am to take your question seriously, I would have to give you that serious answer.
7188579	7190239	Sure.
7190239	7191020	I just don't trust them.
7192642	7193963	City of Heroes
7211912	7221456	Yeah, so apparently City of Heroes, obviously, was shut down a long time ago, back in 2012.
7221456	7230899	But there was some unofficial private servers running the game, and that had been existing for years afterwards.
7230899	7236241	Now, one of those, of course, is a part of, was it the Homecoming?
7236241	7239802	It's this unofficial fan-run project called Homecoming.
7242244	7246869	announced that NCSoft had no plans to kill City of Heroes' private server.
7246869	7255520	Instead, the company is providing the devs with an official license to maintain the City of Heroes' server.
7255520	7260306	So they're coming out and endorsing it, basically, allowing them to continue it on.
7261347	7262168	Which I think is pretty awesome.
7262168	7267850	It says, Homecoming has been granted a license to operate as a City of Heroes server and further develop the game.
7267850	7279195	Subject to conditions and limitations of the contract, but as between us and NCSoft, NCSoft still owns City of Heroes intellectual property and its derivatives.
7279195	7282536	But at least they're going to be allowed to continue, you know,
7283556	7288105	Developing the game, I guess, to add enhancements where need be and stuff like that.
7288105	7289087	So that's pretty cool.
7289087	7291432	Years late, but it's still pretty cool.
7291432	7292113	It's still pretty cool.
7292113	7292434	Yeah.
7292434	7292594	Yeah.
7293735	7312742	Alright, also pretty cool, all of you that participate with our show every week, whether you're here live in our chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, or you're listening on our podcast feed and interacting with us on social media, such as Blue Sky, because I don't read the other one, or sending us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7312742	7316884	Unfortunately, I believe we are email free tonight, DarkSakura, is that correct?
7316884	7317044	Yeah.
7317344	7318085	All right.
7318085	7319806	Well, make DarkSakura work next week.
7319806	7323509	Participate at OrangeLingerie.com is the place to send us some emails.
7323509	7327632	Hey, if nothing else, send us some cute cat pics or dog pics if you don't have cats.
7327632	7330234	And if you don't have cats or dogs, fish pics are acceptable as well.
7330234	7333117	Whoever your loved non-human friends are.
7335681	7346034	And yeah, I will open it up though for folks in our chat if you have anything you want to ask us about, please, please ask it over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
7346034	7351882	I will point out because I saw them join our chat earlier, our pal SlaggyMcWaggy joined.
7352602	7353042	chat.
7353042	7361046	And I know that if you don't know Slaggy, he hosted a show that used to be on this network called the Gamebuoy.org podcast.
7361046	7366388	I'm waiting for them to come back and I hope they do someday and will still join us on the network when they do.
7366388	7375531	But Slaggy has rebranded his Twitch presence because I was joking that Slaggy rebrands more often than Madonna.
7375531	7376792	So Slaggy was going by
7378004	7378244	and Slaggy!
7400133	7405455	HotPocketTree, which is, I love that name by the way, says in chat, I made friends with a moth.
7405455	7407435	Is that cool?
7407435	7407776	I think so.
7407776	7409016	Only if it's a photogenic moth.
7409016	7411817	What if it's one of those big gigantic moths?
7411817	7413677	Those are awesome.
7413677	7414638	Or Mothman.
7414638	7416478	That might be a little bit scary.
7416478	7421620	And hopefully not the kind of moth that you saw in the Silence of the Lambs, because that was creepy.
7421620	7423881	But as long as otherwise the moth wasn't hurting anyone.
7423881	7424841	Mothra.
7424841	7425921	Mothra, yeah.
7425921	7427442	If it was Mothra, then awesome.
7430846	7434848	Uh, DarkTutsuya says, did we talk about Loki's game this week?
7434848	7437349	I know it's one near and dear to my heart at least.
7437349	7440151	Is this which what what are we Loki's game?
7440151	7442112	Are we talking about the one you're developing for the playdate?
7442915	7444176	I'm not developing anything yet.
7444176	7448359	I'm just sitting here looking at the playdate and occasionally downloading stuff to it.
7448359	7452842	Okay, so so it's in its conceptual stage only.
7452842	7458046	We will let you know when shooting has commenced on that product.
7458046	7460488	Oh, Dr. C is talking about the game in the background.
7460488	7461028	You're right.
7461028	7462990	I didn't check this in the beginning of the show.
7462990	7465792	But you have a game playing behind you.
7465792	7467473	As you often do when we're taping our show.
7468362	7469903	Yes.
7469903	7474646	It is only because I couldn't really think of what I wanted to put in the background.
7474646	7477388	So like, okay, I'd like to see like a racing game.
7477388	7481330	So it's Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 6.
7481330	7482191	What a good soundtrack.
7482191	7483992	Only because the soundtracks are awesome.
7483992	7485753	Yeah, soundtracks, those games are always great.
7485753	7488615	Although I don't know if I've listened all the way to six.
7488615	7490816	But the first three, I definitely have done that.
7490816	7493318	So it's cool.
7493318	7494559	I love that.
7494559	7497721	Any last minute stories or other topics to bring up tonight, Loki?
7499609	7500817	Mmm, no.
7501468	7502729	Yeah, I know.
7502729	7505010	It's been it's been one of those weeks.
7505010	7508131	sj100mad is saying, Are we doing predictions again this year?
7508131	7509612	Oh, that's a good thought.
7509612	7511253	Oh, yeah, we should have looked at those.
7511253	7512153	We did those last year.
7512153	7515094	Actually, I think we I think I have them.
7515094	7515795	Okay, let's do it.
7515795	7517135	We should we should look at that.
7517135	7518576	What did we predict?
7518576	7525179	That's what we're gonna find out because I should make our predictions next week, I guess since we're Yeah, I need preparation for that.
7525179	7529001	Yeah, we can look at what our predictions are this year.
7529001	7529061	Um,
7531676	7533357	I don't know if I have them on my desktop.
7533357	7535138	Where did I put OLR 2020?
7535138	7536879	Oh, here we are.
7536879	7537400	I found him.
7537400	7538140	I found him.
7538140	7539081	You ready?
7539081	7539801	Yeah, let's do it.
7539801	7540322	All right.
7540322	7540982	Let's recap.
7540982	7541282	Here we are.
7541282	7544044	I have them in my very fancy notepad file.
7544044	7546565	Wait, how can I make this bigger?
7546565	7546906	Hold on.
7546906	7547206	Hold on.
7547206	7547686	Hold on.
7547686	7552069	We're gonna make this bigger.
7552069	7559454	WordPad, I am using the most current technology I have available to me.
7560638	7561279	on the internet.
7576530	7581932	because the next prediction was me, the PSVR 2 flops.
7581932	7584093	I kind of want to give myself a point for that.
7584093	7584473	I don't know.
7584473	7586614	We should have defined what a flop is.
7586614	7588375	I haven't seen them in stores.
7588375	7588855	Okay.
7588855	7592437	So like, yeah, they may be available because no one's buying them, but like it's.
7593297	7593757	I don't know.
7593757	7594498	All right.
7594498	7595258	Yeah, I know.
7595258	7597640	I think neither one of these are technically correct.
7597640	7601122	It didn't like flop, but it didn't do gangbusters either.
7601122	7603724	So I certainly forgot what what?
7603724	7604945	Yeah, I don't know.
7604945	7606366	Yeah.
7606366	7611749	DarkSakura had predicted the Google Chrome gamebook bombs.
7611749	7619494	I feel like that's in a similar situation where I haven't heard of it bombing, but it isn't really doing gangbusters either.
7619494	7621836	The Google like Google Chrome sales.
7623576	7626618	Abk Microsoft merger will not go through and an example is made of them.
7645430	7647992	DarkSakura said Kotick forced out of the working world completely.
7676429	7678532	HalfPointe
7697114	7702256	Loki says Nintendo finally announces new console for what they're cooking up next year.
7702256	7703437	Nope.
7703437	7704257	Zonk, zonk.
7704257	7705738	Try again.
7705738	7707999	Loki, I don't even remember this.
7707999	7712281	Loki said cocaine bear game is insane and awesome.
7712281	7713042	They never had one.
7714787	7726282	Oh, they never came out with one, that's right, because this was in the movie, that's right, this was in the movie trailer, was everywhere, and Megan and all that shit, and you were like, oh, there's inevitably gonna be a Cocaine Bear game, womp womp, nope, there won't.
7726282	7729507	Uh, me, Valve releases a 3, boy did I get that one wrong.
7730183	7731344	Oh, actually, I take that back.
7731344	7735146	There is a Cocaine Bear game.
7735146	7737187	Is it insane and awesome?
7737187	7741909	It is a web game and it is not insane or awesome.
7741909	7743010	It is Pac-Man.
7743010	7744891	We're keeping that red color.
7744891	7748033	OK, DarkSakura literally can't even.
7748033	7750154	Well, that's that was that she's just given.
7750154	7751014	I've never been able.
7751014	7753356	She's just given herself a point.
7753356	7757418	And then also predicted for Dead by Daylight, Candyman or Pumpkinhead.
7758058	7759899	Good choices, but didn't happen.
7759899	7761460	Let's be let's be real.
7761460	7763181	I was surprised by Chucky.
7763181	7766083	Yeah, let's be real.
7766083	7768145	That's that's a hard one to predict.
7768145	7770506	And the Candyman was being predicted a lot of places.
7770506	7773368	And it's nobody could have predicted Nicolas Cage.
7773368	7774609	That's what I was really going to say.
7774609	7777531	Nobody would have predicted Nicolas Cage for sure.
7777991	7781833	I put something up on my TikTok of me playing him with a Demogorgon.
7781833	7782633	Oh, fun.
7782633	7783193	It's pretty funny.
7783193	7784074	I love that.
7784074	7789576	So honestly, we really only kind of got points in this section here.
7789576	7796899	An example was made of ABK, Mitsuda no longer at Square Enix, and Kotick forced out of the working world completely.
7796899	7798159	Not bad.
7798159	7799740	Not bad.
7799740	7800500	Nah, not great.
7800500	7802061	What did the other podcasts get?
7805356	7805737	Cookies.
7826809	7827089	All right.
7827089	7828191	Thank you, RekordWN.
7828191	7829553	Great job, everyone.
7829553	7833097	And yeah, so we'll do new predictions next week.
7833097	7834899	Thank God I had that file saved.
7834899	7835380	That was great.
7835380	7837122	Maybe next year I'll make a PowerPoint.
7837122	7838104	We'll really do something with it.
7839284	7840544	All right.
7840544	7841545	PowerPoint.
7841545	7843305	It's all keynote.
7843305	7844366	Whatever.
7844366	7845226	Whatever.
7845226	7847386	Or well, what's what's in reality?
7847386	7850047	I don't actually use PowerPoint, to be clear.
7850047	7852888	I use... Rob, real people use Tableau.
7852888	7856409	What's what is Open Office's version?
7856409	7857349	Impress.
7857349	7858630	That's what I've used.
7858630	7859750	Impress.
7859750	7861491	Are you not impressed?
7861491	7867072	Don't you know whenever there's information you need to present, you should just go for Tableau?
7867072	7868153	No, I'll just use Impress.
7870259	7870819	OpenOffice
7895277	7898499	DarkSakura, you are playing Dead by Daylight tonight, right?
7919938	7926220	Yeah, cause it's Sunday night is always killer night unless people are like, play with me.
7926220	7934102	I don't, I'm not able to go as long as I was before because I actually do have work tomorrow.
7934102	7939583	Um, but I need, I need to get some pigu time in, you know, we need some pigu time.
7939583	7940804	Well have fun, have a good stream.
7940804	7944165	Do you have a final thought for us before you head out?
7944165	7949046	Um, fact check before you fucking post.
7950080	7950760	That's all.
7950760	7951180	Good advice.
7951180	7952581	Especially with video content.
7952581	7954782	I'm going to say that right now.
7954782	7959623	Make sure the video content that you're posting isn't from a film that was made three years ago.
7959623	7960583	Okay.
7960583	7961404	Okay, people.
7961404	7962264	Okay.
7962264	7964645	It's too easy to hit that repost button.
7964645	7965425	All right.
7965425	7966165	Later, gators.
7966165	7967886	Bye.
7967886	7971687	Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
7971687	7977909	Hopefully I'll have some new episode content out soon, since I have a lot of it edited already and I probably should just get it done.
7978857	7979865	So we'll do that.
7979865	7980429	We'll get it done.
7981010	7982351	Sounds good.
7982351	7986294	My final thought is I'll be having another new character day with Shane at some point this week.
7986294	7988215	Oh, I've been posting TikToks.
7988215	7989076	I've done like three.
7989076	7990096	I'm a TikToker now.
7990096	7992778	I've I did like three TikToks the first week of January.
7992778	7993119	Yay.
7993119	7995500	And they are I think they're fun little stories.
7995500	7996441	I'm test.
7996441	8002485	I'm actually I kind of thought TikTok would be a fun space to kind of test material for things that I might use on stage later on.
8002485	8007369	So if you want to get some insight into storytelling and things like that, check out TikTok.
8007369	8010611	I am Mr. Mr. Rob Roberts on TikTok because somebody took my name.
8011091	8012052	Twitch, and YouTube
8036551	8037411	There's that.
8037411	8038592	I'll make websites now.
8038592	8040292	What year is this?
8040292	8040392	90s?
8040392	8041633	Mobile friendly sites, too.
8041633	8045794	You got to do that version that, you know, does mobile land, but it's what it is.
8045794	8048355	I have a link tree for now, and that does that does good enough.
8048355	8051717	But yes, especially because I'm trying to do it without Twitter.
8051717	8059179	I don't know if you all know, but like I literally locked my Twitter and there's a my bio now says I don't post here, basically.
8059179	8062921	So it says something equivalent of I don't post here.
8062921	8063601	Go to Blue Sky.
8064401	8081298	um so that and that's you know there's still a lot of people on twitter that won't fucking leave which i understand it's it's comfortable and so forth and there's still a lot of engagement to be had there but i am playing hard mode by being stubborn and not doing fucking twitter so there's that
8082375	8088080	And yeah, Bobby Blackwell says you need websites now so you're not reliant on any social media platform.
8088080	8090762	HotPocketry asks, is BlueSky open?
8090762	8091623	Yes and no.
8091623	8097968	You still need an invite code, which if you need an invite code, like talk to a lot of people in chat can hook you up.
8097968	8102311	Or message me on Discord, we'll get you hooked up.
8102311	8110118	But what they did open up is that now you can actually link to posts and you can see them without having a BlueSky account.
8110618	8111679	which is huge.
8111679	8115622	So basically like your blue skies are now all public.
8115622	8117203	But they gave the user base warning.
8117203	8120846	They said in 30 days, your posts will be viewable publicly.
8120846	8127832	So if you have anything you don't want, you, you know, but, but they keep reminding blue sky has always been an open platform.
8127832	8128673	You need to be careful.
8128673	8134918	You know, they're, they're trying to remind people, but that has not stopped FCF from happening every Friday.
8134918	8138681	And in fact, apparently FCF broke blue sky this last Friday.
8139522	8147035	And FCF does not mean Fuzzy Cat Friday, it means something else, and I will leave it to your active imaginations to figure out.
8148775	8151596	It's not Fat Chicken Friday, but it's close.
8151596	8154558	So I'll leave it at that.
8154558	8156599	But anyway, Blue Sky is fun.
8156599	8157779	That's where I post now.
8157779	8164322	So if you want to see my daily things on short form media, Blue Sky is the place to be.
8164322	8168044	Or Instagram, I still use Instagram, at Mr. Rob Roberts, same name there.
8168044	8169805	You can find all my stuff on Linktree at Rob Roberts.
8170245	8194087	all right um but that's it we're out of here have a wonderful night everybody we will see you next week here on the show uh you're getting the holiday outro tonight one more time because i forgot to sub it out but are we still within the 12 days of christmas i think today i think today is literally the last day or it was yesterday i don't know whatever lazy reason i have you still get the holiday outro one more time happy new year everybody good night
