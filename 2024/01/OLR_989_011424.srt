1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony and Honda want to gamify your commute.

2
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:20,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Gamifying driving is probably an impossible task because any address this crisis or need scenario introduces an unsafe thought into people.

3
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:23,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even commuting itself introduces unsafe thoughts into people.

4
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:28,575
[SPEAKER_00]: The best game in a two-ton death machine is the one they're playing IRL and safety isn't able to be gamed.

5
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,977
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the New Year layoff deja vu avoiding intro.

6
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:35,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Somerson, Loki to tell you more about these and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:48,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:48,142 --> 00:01:01,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 989 of our show for tonight, January the 14th of 2024.

10
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:06,415
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here in the studio each and every week with my co-hosts.

11
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:10,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Somers.

12
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, hello, how are you?

13
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:19,225
[SPEAKER_05]: My eyes are having a very bad allergy attack.

14
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, that's no fun.

15
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:25,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to go take some more Sudafed, even though the rest of me feels fine.

16
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I even got my steroid cream out.

17
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say fun, but that doesn't sound like any fun at all, actually.

18
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:34,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the weather's been wild across the country.

19
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:40,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's California cold here this week, which is, you know, that's that's very cold for us.

20
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:45,275
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the rest of the nation, for the most part, it's it's oh, my God, fucking freezing.

21
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:45,816
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

22
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't live there type weather.

23
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:53,421
[SPEAKER_05]: We were we were certainly a lot colder earlier this week, though, than we are now.

24
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:54,362
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

25
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:58,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And to answer PodCulture's question about that's what, 60?

26
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:01,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 52 here.

27
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:04,748
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes when I would go into work, it would still be in the low 30s.

28
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:13,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really cold for Northern California and not in the like mountainous area.

29
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,193
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a valley, so this place actually traps heat like a pocket.

30
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:21,854
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I call this the convection oven of California.

31
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:26,616
[SPEAKER_05]: But apart from, you know, Satan's parched asshole.

32
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,657
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the summer.

33
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the summer.

34
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And also that's Fresno.

35
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:31,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be clear.

36
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:35,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

37
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:37,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Fresno would be something a little bit more desolate.

38
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:47,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, for those who are in Kolja Climes, please be careful.

39
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:50,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care of yourself and check in with us every so often so that we know you're not dead.

40
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right a good place to check in with us would be our discord.

41
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:57,614
[SPEAKER_03]: You can join our discord server over at vognetwork.com.

42
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:05,597
[SPEAKER_03]: That's VOGnetwork.com slash discord, where we do chat throughout the week we share some stories about what's going on in gaming and sometimes convention updates too.

43
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:08,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about kind of one of those going on right now in just a moment.

44
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:11,760
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I want to also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Loki.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

47
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you doing?

48
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:15,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing pretty good.

49
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:26,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so when we do tape live, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

50
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,508
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't on tonight though, and I'll come back to that in a minute.

51
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:34,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we are live, you you have little videos playing in the background so we don't see your kitchen.

52
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: We see whatever game of the week you have picked instead.

53
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I recognize this one.

54
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this like the Toy Story video game annotation?

55
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:43,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't be.

56
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the character from Toy Story.

57
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:48,316
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Clockwork Knight from the Saturn.

58
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:49,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Alan educate you?

59
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, keep in mind, we didn't get together till much later.

60
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:08,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I learned, but I was I was not really gaming when the Saturn first came out.

61
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:11,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a little break from gaming during college.

62
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:16,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe like I had a PlayStation and I went pretty hard on like other entertainment.

63
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:21,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I didn't I didn't kind of use other entertainment.

64
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

65
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:30,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I appreciate it now, but I don't have the deep knowledge or fondness of the games that many other people do, but I appreciate it now.

66
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,574
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Sega stuff was just really ahead of its time.

67
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It really was, especially Dreamcast, right?

68
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody agrees on that.

69
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dreamcast is just like, you know, was just a little ahead of its time.

70
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:42,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

71
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:46,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, and it did some really stupid stuff too.

72
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.

73
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:52,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I did mention that we tape every week after the Bobby Blackwell show, but he's not here tonight.

74
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That is because if you've been paying attention over the last few weeks, he's at Awesome Games Done Quick.

75
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,432
[SPEAKER_03]: He flew out yesterday.

76
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:03,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the Games Done Quick marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation started today.

77
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:06,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he flew out there yesterday, so it started today.

78
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:11,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And he will be hosting some various games on I think Thursday night and the last day.

79
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:14,154
[SPEAKER_03]: But we actually have a little bit of late breaking news because

80
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:19,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it's unfortunate because of the travel issues going on around the country.

81
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:21,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like another, I think, that's the reason.

82
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm going to blame anyway.

83
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's the reason or not, that's what I'm going to blame.

84
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:29,538
[SPEAKER_03]: The other host that was supposed to be there tonight isn't going to be able to make it.

85
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:33,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bobby is actually going to be doing some stuff tonight at 2 a.m.

86
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern, which will be 11 o'clock Pacific.

87
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 11 o'clock our time, which isn't as bad, but especially because many people have a holiday.

88
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:42,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a holiday tomorrow.

89
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I know many people do, but I know a lot of people don't as well.

90
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:46,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he's taking a nap.

91
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's why he's not here right now.

92
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he's taking a nap before his shift.

93
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Great minds think like us.

94
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:18,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun sometimes to get the behind-the-scenes perspective from, you know, people that, you know, are involved with it.

95
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:26,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know when they did TwitchCon, it was really cool to see the mini festival they did at TwitchCon because it was almost like being at the real event, from what I understand.

96
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:35,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, what I really wanted to say is one of the games that he's ending up hosting tonight is one that I think I would have watched anyway, and it's The Typing of the Dead.

97
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:38,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of wonderful Sega games ahead of their time,

98
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:46,056
[SPEAKER_03]: The Typing of the Dead is one of the speedruns that he will be reading donations during tonight.

99
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:49,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a surprise edition, which is unfortunate for somebody else.

100
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope everybody that is trying to get to Games Done Quick is being safe and traveling A-OK.

101
00:06:55,278 --> 00:07:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know Bobby will step in at the last minute and do a fantastic job.

102
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

103
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'll be back live next week if you do want to see video.

104
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:15,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into our show tonight.

105
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:22,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually we start off the show with like a kickoff topic, a headline here to start things off.

106
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:26,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, we're gonna do it just a little bit different because at the end of last week's show,

107
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:43,076
[SPEAKER_03]: We took a look back at our 2023 predictions and it turns out we were wrong on most of them But we did there was I think we had one and a half points from things that we did call That would happen this next year and predictions are fun.

108
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,017
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a little silly.

109
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:49,221
[SPEAKER_03]: They're light-hearted It's not meant to be taken super seriously, but I'm gonna try to make some serious predictions tonight and

110
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have anything you want to add,

111
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:14,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Please go ahead and put it in the chat because if we decide one of yours is better than one of ours, we've been known to steal from chat and give you credit for that.

112
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:19,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I will just say, I'll open this up to emails and people that listen on the podcast feed throughout the week.

113
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:24,484
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to email us, I'd love to read some good predictions next week on the show.

114
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, let's go around the room and check out.

115
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:35,008
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put on our thinking caps and get our tarot decks and our future predicting Ouija boards.

116
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,548
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to contact the dead.

117
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:44,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to light some candles and we are going to figure out what is going to happen this year in gaming with our 2024 gaming predictions.

118
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:45,392
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, Jamie?

119
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the lady from Mallrats with her fake third nipple.

120
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:53,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the alien from Total Recall with her real third nipple.

121
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

122
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:59,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, don't you remember the Psychic and the Good Mole?

123
00:08:59,293 --> 00:08:59,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I do.

124
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:00,253
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% I do.

125
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

126
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:06,475
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Shannon Doherty blames that movie for ruining her career, by the way.

127
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a whole other... It's like, you should be... Anyway.

128
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:14,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, she was in a Kevin Smith movie, so that should have boosted her.

129
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:16,137
[SPEAKER_05]: If she failed, it's her own damn fault.

130
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:21,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird that all the other careers of those people were just fine, but hers in particular...

131
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:25,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that's just a clickbait headline I fell for.

132
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, what has he done?

133
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:32,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that guy just, like, faded into obscurity.

134
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.

135
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:33,877
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

136
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:34,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

137
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:34,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

138
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about 1998 anymore.

139
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at 2024.

140
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

141
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:40,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Our 2024 predictions.

142
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's feeling brave and wants to go first?

143
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:42,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is.

144
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:43,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

145
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:45,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go first.

146
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, DarkSakura volunteered.

147
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:50,188
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, go ahead.

148
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:50,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Go first.

149
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:56,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's stupid, but Paprium will get a release date for Steam.

150
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:58,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Wha- I'm sorry, what game?

151
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:58,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Paprium.

152
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Paprium.

153
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, uh- There's a lot of drama about this.

154
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:13,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this massive brawler that had this huge-ass Kickstarter, uh, for, um, for the Mega Drive or Genesis, and the game was fraught with issues.

155
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:20,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And they made, like, there's another Kickstarter out there to get it on Steam, um, but,

156
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:28,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I am predicting a playable version to be released this year.

157
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to throw it out there.

158
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so, because I really want to play Paprium.

159
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to pay, you know, $120 to buy the cartridge, but I want to play Paprium.

160
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:38,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

161
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

162
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:39,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it now.

163
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:40,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

164
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:42,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that you said it was like the Genesis Kickstarter.

165
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:42,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

166
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

167
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:42,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

168
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:43,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

169
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:44,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I did hear about this.

170
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:44,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

171
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:45,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.

172
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

173
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:48,915
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, that brings us to you then.

174
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:49,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can go.

175
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your number three prediction?

176
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:55,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going to start it off on a high note here.

177
00:10:55,938 --> 00:11:02,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Kotick becomes the CEO of another game industry slash game industry adjacent company.

178
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're wrong.

179
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:09,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're wrong too, but I'm gonna look sometimes with these predictions.

180
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that we want them to come true.

181
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,541
[SPEAKER_03]: We just sing it.

182
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,666
[SPEAKER_03]: The cynics cynics in us say it will so Oh,

183
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I'm trying to think how to write this here.

184
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming adjacent company.

185
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And what, what are your reasons for that?

186
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:30,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying that because this is one of those things where it's like assholes are never held accountable?

187
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:30,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of thing?

188
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:36,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because people like him just don't fade away into obscurity.

189
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:39,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They always come back into like other roles.

190
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:43,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I could see like Unity going, Hey, we need another CEO.

191
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring him on in, you know, like, cause

192
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:56,342
[SPEAKER_03]: uh loki brave enough to even say what company he thinks it'll be all right so i don't know we'll see it's hopefully he just goes away but

193
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:57,901
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

194
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:01,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I have other things I wish you would do, but yeah, that's neither here nor there.

195
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

196
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:04,005
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTutsuya says insert Darth Vader.

197
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,026
[SPEAKER_03]: No here.

198
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that isn't appropriate.

199
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:16,393
[SPEAKER_03]: That TigerClaw thinks TigerClaw is literally going to double down and says John Riccatello will also probably be the CEO of some other company.

200
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,794
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to run into the ground.

201
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:23,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that actually Loki, that may be what I say about that.

202
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:24,779
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I say about that?

203
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:24,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

204
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Die, monster!

205
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:29,705
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't belong in this world!

206
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:34,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, not you getting fucking soundboard access.

207
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,391
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

208
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:38,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I made it myself.

209
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

210
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's get to my number three.

211
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:41,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

212
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:45,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this one is also a little bit of a safe bet for me.

213
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:53,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm admittedly, this is a safe bet for me because we're going to have a story later where some of this is already happening, but I'm going to take it a little bit of a step further.

214
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:59,124
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to say that two launch titles for the switch successor.

215
00:12:59,124 --> 00:12:59,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I,

216
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:03,785
[SPEAKER_03]: For me to predict the Switch successor is happening this year, that is way too safe of a prediction.

217
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:05,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it's happening this year.

218
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:12,008
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to predict that two LaunchWidow titles for the Switch successor are Microsoft games.

219
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:17,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And because that may be a little too safe, I'm actually going to say one of them is Sea of Thieves.

220
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the other one will be the Diablo 4 plus its expansion that will come out later this year.

221
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will come out around the same time as the Switch successor.

222
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:29,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that will also be, because technically now Microsoft owns all those titles,

223
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:34,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Overwatch 2 would be an extremely safe pick as well.

224
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:46,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, I could see this being three launch window titles for Switch successor, but I really do think one of them will be outside the Activision Blizzard bubble, and that's why I'm saying Sea of Thieves in particular.

225
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:55,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, in particular, the co-opness of Sea of Thieves that Microsoft really wants to push, I think that might...

226
00:13:56,806 --> 00:14:06,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to say this tactfully, I think that plays better in Nintendo's ecosystem versus what has historically been Microsoft's ecosystem.

227
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just let y'all chew on what I mean by that.

228
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not to say there aren't people enjoying and thriving in Sea of Thieves in the Microsoft ecosystem now, but I think Microsoft is going to see that if they really want to grow that, the Nintendo audience is who they want to tap into.

229
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:27,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, Chad is naming a game that we're going to get to later that technically is potentially already releasing for this generation of Switch.

230
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:30,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about Microsoft's continued support for the Switch successor.

231
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,035
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so let's get into the number two.

232
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:36,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know why we order these.

233
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:37,638
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all really the same.

234
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:38,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, sorry.

235
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's me playing in WordPad if you hear that little ding.

236
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get into the number two predictions or the poopy predictions.

237
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:51,391
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's your number two prediction?

238
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,274
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 announces yet another metamorphosis just when we thought they were done.

239
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dark.

240
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:00,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you would you based on the clip you just played?

241
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be dark metamorphosis?

242
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, maybe?

243
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:08,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe?

244
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:08,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

245
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:13,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so E3 announces so they're not so E3 isn't really dead.

246
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: They go through a dark metamorphosis.

247
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:16,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And

248
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody buys the E3 name or something like that.

249
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:22,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I could go with that.

250
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go with that.

251
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what you thought it was safe to be rid of E3.

252
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:27,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

253
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:30,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's your number two pick?

254
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:33,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Switch successor would be announced by March.

255
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:39,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out next year and launches with Metroid Prime 4 and Mario Odyssey 2.

256
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:40,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

257
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, did you say next year though?

258
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mean 2025 or do you mean later this year? 2025.

259
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, okay.

260
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:50,859
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the that's the part of your prediction.

261
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you got right.

262
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: But I maybe that's that's why we do this.

263
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we do this.

264
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:57,543
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

265
00:15:57,543 --> 00:15:58,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

266
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.

267
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think it's all the way in 2025?

268
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:05,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think they missed this year after all the hype for this year?

269
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just over time.

270
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they need more time.

271
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:27,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, you know, now that I think about it, though, a 2025 release would not mean a March announcement, because that would kill sales for the rest of the year, unless they're doing something like, we're going to keep both SKUs around type of stuff, you know, DS Lite, DS type thing.

272
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

273
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:52,167
[SPEAKER_03]: were coded with another Switch in mind that never released.

274
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:58,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think those games are going to play a lot better on the Switch successor.

275
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that should be one of my predictions, but in my gut, I feel like that's true with those.

276
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:06,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel it in your bones?

277
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe at the end of the year, so in the last, in the holiday rush, a game, a AAA game in the holiday rush is going to get targeted, dragged, and exposed because of its overuse of AI.

278
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:40,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, a game that tries to pass itself off as not having a lot of this in it,

279
00:17:41,437 --> 00:18:07,504
[SPEAKER_03]: people on the inside are going to uh report undercover or it's going to come out in the review process that there is a overuse of AI there's a lot of AI that's in this in the AI-generated AI-generated AI-generated quest AI-generated voice acting and AI-generated assets are going to show up in the game and this game gets universally dragged by social media and I'm talking a shlacking of like um

280
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,769
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the Square Enix game that just shit the bed when it came out by the Sega guy?

281
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the... By Sonic?

282
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:17,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know which one.

283
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that reused the 14 assets?

284
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:20,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That one?

285
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good example too.

286
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:26,642
[SPEAKER_03]: That and the cutesy cartoon game that nobody liked.

287
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:28,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Balan Wonderland.

288
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:29,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DarkSakura.

289
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:31,488
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to think about.

290
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:38,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking, it gets its ass kicked on social media in that regard, and the game absolutely tanks and puts the company in danger.

291
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:44,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, because I think this is a safe pick, I'm going to go so far as to say Ubisoft is the culprit.

292
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm leaning into that because we know that they've been developing

293
00:18:48,667 --> 00:19:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: technology for AI quest generated things and I think this games as a service stuff, I think somebody tries to lean in and use AI for this games as a service and their pants get pulled all the way off and their butt and balls are completely exposed to the entire gaming world and nobody buys this game as a result.

294
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:14,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, isn't that a safe pick?

295
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:16,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it, but it's a safe pick, don't you think?

296
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, yeah, it's pretty safe.

297
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:29,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I was also just thinking though, I don't have a problem with like, like fetch quest stuff being randomly generated by AI, but definitely the use of art assets and music and voice acting.

298
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:35,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say what you're describing is like what Skyrim did to generate the daily quest.

299
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think most people are like, okay with that.

300
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:41,825
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm gonna, I'm gonna say it goes one step further than that.

301
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:43,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually 10 steps further than that.

302
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:43,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

303
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:51,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, numero uno, the top prediction, although these really aren't ranked, but we're going to pretend they are anyway.

304
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,235
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

305
00:19:53,235 --> 00:20:07,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this one's actually a safe one, but just from experiences of my own recently that I actually can't talk about, I'm going to say an even bigger push on VR and spatial computing in and outside of the gaming industry.

306
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:15,391
[SPEAKER_03]: a bigger push in VR in and outside the gaming industry.

307
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:19,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And spatial computing, as in spatial environments for computing.

308
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, okay.

309
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We're already seeing a big push with spatial audio.

310
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:25,796
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a lot more.

311
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:26,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

312
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:33,840
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have spatial computing with some of the recently announced products coming out.

313
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Oculus is still a thing.

314
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:40,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are now getting into that VR environment

315
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:48,370
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world of consumer computing.

316
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:55,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's going to be an even bigger boom in that.

317
00:20:55,056 --> 00:21:02,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we've got an announcement date after the Vision Pro is released, I think we're going to see a lot of people trying to follow suit.

318
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

319
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:04,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

320
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:11,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the gaming space, I look at something like Niantic, because I play a lot of Niantic games.

321
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:17,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Go obviously being the most common, but of course, Monster Hunter now, Pikmin, Ingress, these are all things.

322
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:22,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ingress is usually kind of the canary in the coal mine for a lot of Niantic stuff.

323
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:27,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've gotten really big into scanning, which again is AR, not VR, but it's still

324
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Spatial Augmented Reality.

325
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:31,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

326
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still for those who don't know.

327
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:34,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's still very spatial.

328
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:39,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you can do is you scan these 3D portals and now you do hacking in 3D around the landmark.

329
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:42,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's called overclocking in the games mechanic.

330
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is not an official prediction of mine, but I do think kind of along these lines, you're going to see something in Pokemon Go this year that utilizes that because and my thought was mass outbreaks would be a feature that they're going to bring is that you start to scan

331
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,346
[SPEAKER_03]: the I keep calling them portals because they are in Ingress, but you scan the landmark.

332
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And what will happen is that for like 60 seconds, you're going to see Pokemon just like pop out behind the sculpture, walk out from around the sculpture.

333
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:17,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but like like in the 3D environment with your phone, you'll actually see them pop out because they kind of have this in AR now.

334
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they don't do is they don't actually interact with the landmarks.

335
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:24,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But behind the scenes, they've been collecting scans of all the landmarks.

336
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:25,955
[SPEAKER_03]: If you play Pokemon Go, you scan landmarks.

337
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:31,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is actually really easy for iOS with the virtual reality kit.

338
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:31,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

339
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:42,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with, you know, I think the Apple Vision thing is going to be a great way for them to enact this type of thing in Pokemon Go potentially.

340
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

341
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:43,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

342
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:48,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, you know, it's one of those crazy predictions where I was like, I wonder how they would utilize this feature in Pokemon Go.

343
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I could see like 60 seconds of Pikachus everywhere.

344
00:22:53,464 --> 00:23:04,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree with it being for games like Pokemon Go, but I could see it for other games that would involve staying in the house.

345
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:04,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

346
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:05,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

347
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:06,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

348
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:08,078
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

349
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:08,838
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

350
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:11,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go to Loki, your numero uno prediction.

351
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:25,118
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really have a really big number one prediction, but, um, I'm waiting to make the prediction that the, well, obviously by the time, cause it's not coming out until next March, March or April, I think.

352
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:30,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the, the Minecraft movie trailer will come out and it will suck really bad.

353
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:38,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I will still go see it though in 2025, but that's my prediction is that the, the movie trailer for the Minecraft movie is going to be awful.

354
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:42,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sounds awful.

355
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the safest prediction on this entire list.

356
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had a lot of safe predictions tonight.

357
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to be awful, but it it's gonna be awful.

358
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's this live action.

359
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gonna be it's gonna be awful.

360
00:23:58,423 --> 00:23:59,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel.

361
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,104
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

362
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:03,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and my number one you want to talk about?

363
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this maybe isn't a safe pick.

364
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:10,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say this and I'm going to explain why.

365
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're going to think this isn't a big deal, but when I explain the why, I think you'll understand.

366
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:15,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is.

367
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:22,971
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one prediction is the Game of the Year at Dorito Pope's 2024 Game Awards is an indie game.

368
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be a AAA game.

369
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,109
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be an indie game.

370
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:31,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I'm saying that is that, you know, we're going to get into this in a little bit here.

371
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:36,854
[SPEAKER_03]: We get into the news of this week, but there's obviously, there's been a lot of layoffs in the industry, in the tech industry.

372
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:39,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We've, we've heard a lot about this and it's, it's really unfortunate.

373
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a theme that's been continuing from 2023.

374
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:52,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And for such a bright year as 2023 was in gaming, it just sucks that the industry has not been able to

375
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:58,045
[SPEAKER_03]: stay on top of itself in a business sense that you know, it's been poorly managed.

376
00:24:58,045 --> 00:25:02,888
[SPEAKER_03]: The product has been great across mostly mostly across the board, except for that Kong game.

377
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:07,031
[SPEAKER_03]: But even the Kong game was bad because it was poorly managed.

378
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:11,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, you know, unfortunately, you're seeing a lot of these layoffs.

379
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:17,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But the interesting thing about the gaming industry is that unlike a lot of industries, if you

380
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:30,455
[SPEAKER_03]: get laid off or you leave the gaming industry, and you have the means and resources, which isn't available for everybody, but you have the means and resources to sustain yourself for a little while, you can make your own game.

381
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:42,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what and you can make your own product and ultimately it's very easy to put your own product out there on Steam, you know, an epic store a variety of different places, y'all know the game stores out there.

382
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:53,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what happens is that some of these people that were laid off in 2023, band together, make an indie studio, and they make the fucking next Minecraft, the next

383
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Five Nights at Freddy's, the next, you know, you name it, huge indie title.

384
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:09,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you get a swell of support, not just because the game is good, but because people kind of want to stick it to the man this year.

385
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:18,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to award an indie game that I think the story will be that these folks that got laid off came together to create an even better game.

386
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:22,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's what ultimately wins the 2024 Game of the Year award.

387
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:22,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

388
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,424
[SPEAKER_03]: There's somewhat of that playing into my AI prediction as well.

389
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:42,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's going to be a lot of pushback from people against these fat cats that still, in the management, they're still working at these companies that cut all the people making the meaningful work out of it.

390
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:46,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's going to be a lot of people that want to see them fail, and I don't blame them.

391
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's why you're going to see exposure with AAA games and so forth.

392
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, Tigerclaw brings up a great point.

393
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:59,852
[SPEAKER_03]: If Baldur's Gate 3 is any indication, 2024 will have a huge indie game that's going to win many awards.

394
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,075
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not sure where we draw- It's probably an indie game.

395
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:07,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm not sure where we draw the line with indie, but, like, it kinda, yeah, like...

396
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,042
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the reason why Baldur's Gate 3 was so well received is a lot of that.

397
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:20,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's the whole pushing back against DLC and releasing a product that's actually worth the $70 that you pay for and all that.

398
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:23,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why that game got embraced in many of the ways that it has.

399
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:28,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Except it has gotten updates and new content.

400
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:28,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

401
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And for free.

402
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So, which is great.

403
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,451
[SPEAKER_05]: But it still doesn't mean that it's not DLC, you know?

404
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:34,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, sure.

405
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:43,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I, I think, um, the game of the year 2024 will be a little bit more on the cheaper end than Baldur's Gate 3, but we'll see.

406
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:44,490
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

407
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,751
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, those are my thoughts.

408
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, um, let's recap.

409
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:50,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you the lovely WordPad file that I'm about to save here.

410
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:53,937
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to recap my very professional notes here.

411
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:55,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Our predictions.

412
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:58,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So Paprium, uh, releases on Steam.

413
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:02,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Kotick becomes the CEO of another gaming or gaming adjacent company.

414
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:10,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Two launch window titles for the Switch successor are Microsoft games, and one of them is Sea of Thieves.

415
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:13,876
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 announces another metamorphosis.

416
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,356
[SPEAKER_03]: A dark metamorphosis.

417
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:23,038
[SPEAKER_03]: The Switch successor is announced by March, and Prime 4 and Odyssey are launch titles, and it releases 2025.

418
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:30,900
[SPEAKER_03]: A AAA game gets exposed for way overuse of AI, and it causes the game to absolutely tank.

419
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:44,392
[SPEAKER_03]: a bigger push in VR and spatial environments in and outside the gaming industry, the Minecraft movie trailer sucks, and the Game of the Year 2024 at the Game Awards is an indie game.

420
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:45,994
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

421
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:47,676
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think we're going to score, y'all?

422
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:49,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked that in our chat room.

423
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these are actually pretty safe predictions.

424
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:59,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't think Paprium's gonna happen, but... This is, like, honestly, this is probably, like, the safest prediction year I've ever seen us do.

425
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:00,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

426
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:02,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

427
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:08,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe after getting bruised a little bit, after only getting... Okay, leave me... Sorry, it's bugging me here.

428
00:29:08,151 --> 00:29:17,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe after getting bruised a little bit with only getting one and a half right last year, we're dialing it back a little bit with some more safe and less big predictions.

429
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:18,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know

430
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:48,608
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at an industry now that we've had our toes dipped into for, you know, decades now and looking at the ebb and flow, paying attention to the world around it and making some pretty solid fact based predictions.

431
00:29:49,088 --> 00:30:04,378
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that's a damn good point, you know, and I think I hesitate to call these cynical predictions, but they live in that world of like, realism of like being around like, for example, the Bobby Kotick thing, that prediction sucks.

432
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:09,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But it comes from that place of we've we have seen shitty people succeed too many times.

433
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:16,262
[SPEAKER_05]: As the saying goes, you know, a cynic is what an optimist calls a realist.

434
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:25,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say my AI pick, and ultimately what drove me to say the indie game for 2024, I would say those picks of mine are rooted in that a little bit as well.

435
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:33,385
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not just something that, you know, we shat out one day and decided that they were going to be our predictions.

436
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:34,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, DarkSakura.

437
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:37,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I did write these on the toilet earlier today.

438
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:38,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we need to know that, Rob?

439
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:41,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding, or am I?

440
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

441
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:44,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I did mine five minutes before the show.

442
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:56,852
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the other thing too, is just that I think because we're so versed in the ebb and flow of things, that we, we can.

443
00:30:56,852 --> 00:31:05,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the record, Bonds006, I said, VR in general, meta is part of that universe.

444
00:31:05,117 --> 00:31:14,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't focus on that one because I think we're going to get a whole lot of imitators after the Vision Pro gets released, which we only have, you know,

445
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:20,259
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of time before those pre-orders go up as it was already announced.

446
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:20,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

447
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:27,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I think outside of the, you know, former Oculus realm, I think Meta kind of stays out of gaming.

448
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:29,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah, that's it.

449
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,099
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't have Froth on your PC.

450
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Bons006 apologizes.

451
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, no, it's totally fine.

452
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

453
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:49,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'll, you know, if I wanted to do a really safe prediction, I would have brought back tonight's intro bump that we play live before the show, and I would have said Atari releases 10 more versions of Yars' Revenge.

454
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:50,748
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have also been a safe pick.

455
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:55,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

456
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a safe prediction and that's that Midnight can't stop throwing up all over the house.

457
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:01,514
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a safe prediction.

458
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:02,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, hold on.

459
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

460
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy me 30 seconds because on the Yars Revenge note, I have something to share.

461
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:08,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy me 30 seconds.

462
00:32:08,238 --> 00:32:09,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy you 30 seconds with what?

463
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:10,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any money.

464
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:12,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't buy time.

465
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I look like a demigod?

466
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:16,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, maybe I kind of do.

467
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do that.

468
00:32:17,423 --> 00:32:18,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have that ability.

469
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:18,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, do you?

470
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:19,987
[SPEAKER_01]: and

471
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yars' Revenge

472
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:13,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am not fucking helping.

473
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,332
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the record, this cartridge is actually out of print.

474
00:33:16,332 --> 00:33:17,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of why I bought it.

475
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:18,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have too much.

476
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:21,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I also bought Namco 1 and 2.

477
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:22,819
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

478
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it not PAL?

479
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:25,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja Golf

480
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,106
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but keep in mind this is Collection 2.

481
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:57,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what was in Collection 1.

482
00:33:57,046 --> 00:33:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not find Collection 1 anywhere.

483
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:01,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninja Golf is such a weird fucking game.

484
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:05,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna get those Toaplan cartridges at some point, just to make you jealous, DarkSakura.

485
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, but I'm gonna pretend it makes you jealous.

486
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean when I can go grab my Genesis and play Zero Wing?

487
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yeah.

488
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, but I will say this.

489
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let me bring up... You know I have an Ultracade, right?

490
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

491
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:23,063
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

492
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

493
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:28,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I'm going to put this out there because I know we have listeners overseas.

494
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:28,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

495
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:32,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes DarkSakura asks the listeners for things she wants.

496
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:36,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put this out because this is the Evercade cartridge I want more than anything.

497
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like $90 on eBay.

498
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know somebody's got to have it out there.

499
00:34:41,836 --> 00:34:42,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this one.

500
00:34:42,796 --> 00:34:43,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

501
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: This is no longer in print.

502
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:47,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Pico.

503
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Pico Interactive Collection 1.

504
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Piko, P-I-K-O.

505
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:56,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And the games that are in this are fucking obscure-ass games, but they're great.

506
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:59,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight Eyes, which was on the NES, you might remember.

507
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Drakken, which I know I've talked about this game before.

508
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dragon View.

509
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,433
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the fucking gold bar game in this pack, is Dragon View.

510
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:15,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I could just bring it up in an emulator if I wanted to, but I think it would be so cool to have a legitimate version of Dragon View.

511
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It also has The Immortal from NES.

512
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:19,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot of, you know, because, yeah.

513
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,565
[SPEAKER_03]: PowerPunch2, which literally looks like a rip-off of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!

514
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:35,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Exploding Fist, which I vaguely... Top Racer, I vaguely remember a lot of these games from Nintendo and Super Nintendo, but that is like, right now, my holy grail for this system.

515
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing I want more than anything right now.

516
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:45,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put up one of my searches for you because I have good trackers on that.

517
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:46,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

518
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:47,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

519
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:55,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because if I if I could find it, it's because I did pay $30 for the Namco carts, and I think they're usually around $20, but they wanted $90 on eBay for this.

520
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:57,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, no, no, that's that's too much.

521
00:35:57,437 --> 00:36:03,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did find the Data East collection and the Jolly Go collection, Data East and the Interplay collection.

522
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Data East, if you buy, well, most of the cartridges are still in print and Data East, by the way, is a pack-in game with the Versus.

523
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:13,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you buy the handheld, the handheld... Gremlin Collection.

524
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

525
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a ton of great collections on that thing.

526
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:16,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

527
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:17,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

528
00:36:17,072 --> 00:36:18,293
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want to sound like a shill.

529
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,815
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that I happen to have and I want.

530
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're getting into our gaming weeks a little bit.

531
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:27,681
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should probably turn it over and ask folks, how was your gaming week?

532
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go to DarkSakura and ask, how was your gaming week?

533
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:37,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually a little bit eventful.

534
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:45,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I, of course, played some Dead by Daylight and had a pretty good time, although I didn't play it for a super long time.

535
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:47,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried again to do Baldur's Gate 3.

536
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:53,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned off my cloud saves and that made zero difference for streaming, so I am relegated to playing it offline.

537
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:58,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least not streaming.

538
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:10,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I also, of course, played Rudra no Hiho, which is Treasure of the Rudras, the last game that Square released for the Super Famicom.

539
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:14,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And I finished the second scenario, so now I've started on the third scenario.

540
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Love that game.

541
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really fucking good.

542
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:18,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs a re-release.

543
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:32,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I also played some Jackie Crush, you know, one of those pinball games in the Devil's Crush series, but that was on Super Famicom.

544
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:48,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I also started, I started Maria's scenario on Nocturne in the Moonlight, which, and I'm talking about like the English translation and everything, but I decided I really wanted- That patch we talked about last week, or like something you just talked about?

545
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:48,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

546
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

547
00:37:50,376 --> 00:38:06,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I already officially own the game, so I can legally... I actually own this, I own the translation it's based off of, and the voice acting that they included in it, so it's like... I own all the pieces that made this game, I can legally emulate it, okay?

548
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:13,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So, at any rate, I decided to start the main scenario with Alucard.

549
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And the voices, I mean, they are different.

550
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,943
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones from the PSP.

551
00:38:16,943 --> 00:38:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not at all bad.

552
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:20,605
[SPEAKER_05]: The dialogue makes more sense.

553
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:29,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's gonna take me a while to remember, you know, get my muscle memory back, and dear lord, I need to finish getting Alucard all of his skills.

554
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:35,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already done the two monster fight and I did the doppelganger fight already.

555
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:38,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I was way too underpowered for the doppelganger fight.

556
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:39,273
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

557
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:42,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You can carry turkey and chicken in your pocket and that'll save you.

558
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've played a couple of other things.

559
00:38:49,777 --> 00:39:06,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I've basically been trying to find ISOs for games that I own, so I don't have to dig out my Saturn every time that I want to play them, or my Wii or anything like that.

560
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am planning on doing a random old-school

561
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:20,368
[SPEAKER_05]: game night like once a week since Baldur's Gate 3 is being such a fail for me.

562
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:23,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nothing wrong with retro throwbacks and all that good stuff.

563
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I love me a retro game.

564
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:30,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too, because I'm old.

565
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,781
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

566
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:33,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if that's all, we'll move on to Loki.

567
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:34,584
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

568
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:37,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically Minecraft.

569
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:43,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been grinding, trying to get resources for a build I'm doing on Fever Dream, which I'm just about done doing.

570
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:55,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did play a little bit of my Playdate, so I was checking out Pickpack Pup, which is a match-three type game where you have to pack up items into boxes and you get money for that.

571
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a trasher.

572
00:39:57,837 --> 00:40:02,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, as time goes on, it starts trashing the bottom row, and you lose money from that.

573
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:04,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fun.

574
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,661
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, if I may, I have an urgent thing to tell Rob.

575
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:10,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

576
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:16,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I found your cartridge for $21.99.

577
00:40:16,424 --> 00:40:19,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Please send me the link, but make sure it's not the arcade collection.

578
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:20,545
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a difference.

579
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:21,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

580
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:22,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have put that out there.

581
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:25,607
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an arcade collection that's still in print.

582
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:28,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to have Dragonsview on it.

583
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remember Dragonsview.

584
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:31,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back on the hunt.

585
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, back on the hunt.

586
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,870
Okay.

587
00:40:34,963 --> 00:40:36,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, you know me.

588
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:37,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

589
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:38,024
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

590
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:40,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's it for Loki's gaming week.

591
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:46,085
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, a lot of Final Fantasy 14 still playing a little bit of Overwatch 2 actually.

592
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:52,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing Overwatch 2 with Grandpa Warcraft or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling actually a couple nights ago.

593
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:54,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And because he actually plays that game quite a bit.

594
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:57,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were playing together for a little bit and that was always fun.

595
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:59,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, this is random, but not really.

596
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I was playing Diablo 3.

597
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

598
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I be playing Diablo 3 when Diablo 4 is out?

599
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:16,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Season 30 of Diablo 3 started this last week, and I was curious, and I wanted to go back and check it out because, um, this is the first season that is essentially not new.

600
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,569
[SPEAKER_03]: They're recycling stuff, but they're

601
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:20,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Paragon Board Alter of Rights

602
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:52,132
[SPEAKER_03]: If you play a necromancer, you can get to level 70 in 60 minutes because of this board.

603
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

604
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:57,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has the portals to the other realms during the bounties that the last season had.

605
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:58,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just interesting.

606
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been enjoying checking that out.

607
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go too far with this season.

608
00:42:02,342 --> 00:42:07,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's, you know, it's fun to go back and visit an old friend and say hello, I missed you.

609
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:21,470
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know retro I is Diablo 3 a retro game at this point I think so when did it come out originally 2012 maybe I can't remember what year it came out but I think it's over 10 years old at this point so it's a classic game for me

610
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's otherwise that's pretty much my gaming week a little bit.

611
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been playing a little bit of my Evercade.

612
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't I just got the Atari one yesterday though.

613
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:31,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't gotten this open this yet.

614
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the Namco one and Namco two collections which are also out of print.

615
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:38,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I have those on the way.

616
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:43,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of course, who doesn't need another way to play Pacman?

617
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:45,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't need another way to play Pacman?

618
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:45,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that on the way.

619
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:53,034
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into some gaming news of the week.

620
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:57,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with a bummer, but it's something we've got to talk about, right, Loki?

621
00:42:57,237 --> 00:43:00,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's been a lot of layoffs in the beginning of the year.

622
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing because this is the quarter four for a lot of companies for their financial year.

623
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:08,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over them.

624
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:18,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Already this year we've had over 2700 layoffs across a variety of different companies.

625
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Unity laid off 1800 people, or 25% of its staff.

626
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,972
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing its reset, if you will.

627
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:34,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Bossa Studios laid off 19 people.

628
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Archaic, they laid off an unknown number of people.

629
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:45,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitch laid off 500 people, which is 35% of its total staff.

630
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:47,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Playtika laid off 300 to 400 people.

631
00:43:47,678 --> 00:43:48,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Discord, 170.

632
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

633
00:43:54,994 --> 00:44:09,246
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I think there was even more than that, but like, oh yeah, we had Lost Boys Interactive, there was an unknown number of people, and then FunSelector, which I think is probably a smaller studio, laid off three people as well, three developers.

634
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:13,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of layoffs, and that sucks.

635
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:16,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously they'll be able to bounce back.

636
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:21,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the Twitch one really resonates because, you know, that's the platform we're broadcasting on now.

637
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:25,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of us, you know, either partake or you'll create Twitch streams as well.

638
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:31,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit shocking to hear because they just, you may recall, they just had layoffs already towards the end of last year.

639
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:31,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

640
00:44:31,987 --> 00:44:39,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were saying that they're being, they're unprofitable, even though they've made like $13 billion on the platform as well, which is interesting.

641
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:46,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting to think what Twitch is going to do to try to keep surviving because I just, I...

642
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:49,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

643
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:51,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be so bummed if Twitch went away.

644
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would.

645
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:55,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's just not a lot of great alternatives out there.

646
00:44:55,522 --> 00:45:07,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to the green site, and I guess there's YouTube, which is... I've certainly had my issues with YouTube in the past, and I continue to, but I feel like, I guess, if YouTube's a thing, then sure.

647
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,732
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like what we've got going here at Twitch.

648
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:11,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, yeah.

649
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:16,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shocked they can lay off 30% of the staff and the lights are still on.

650
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, where did where did they cut those people?

651
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:22,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that is that from how many employees?

652
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, yeah, shocking.

653
00:45:27,797 --> 00:45:32,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Sj100 Matt in our chat says this is them saying see, we're not heartless monsters.

654
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:33,999
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't lay folks off during the holidays.

655
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:34,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't we great?

656
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:39,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about doing the bare minimum.

657
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:43,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster in chat says Twitch's burn rate must be wild.

658
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:48,564
[SPEAKER_03]: They allegedly take in a ton of revenue, but none of it is actual profit.

659
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:51,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So where's the money going?

660
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all bandwidth?

661
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

662
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:56,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know either.

663
00:45:56,508 --> 00:45:57,068
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair,

664
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:06,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear about these multi-million dollar CEOs, we hear about the golden parachute for Bobby Kotick, and it pisses us all off.

665
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:12,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that Twitch doesn't quite have as fat of a top.

666
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:16,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the CEO does pretty well for himself, but I don't think the top is nearly as fat.

667
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:20,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very curious.

668
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

669
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,455
[SPEAKER_03]: As Jonah Matt says, the maintenance cost is very high.

670
00:46:23,455 --> 00:46:29,224
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor that part of the Twitch sale was due to the very Amazon Web Services costs that they owed.

671
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:30,787
[SPEAKER_03]: That is wild.

672
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:37,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then Amazon needs, again, I would say some of this is Amazon's fault.

673
00:46:37,283 --> 00:46:40,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say Amazon leverages Twitch very poorly.

674
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very poorly.

675
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:44,749
[SPEAKER_03]: There's much more that Amazon could lean into.

676
00:46:44,749 --> 00:46:52,757
[SPEAKER_03]: The watch parties was a start, but I bet half of you forgot that was even a thing until I mentioned it just now.

677
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:58,141
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to try to drive more eyes towards Amazon Prime and the shows that they're doing there.

678
00:46:58,141 --> 00:47:03,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I'm, I really feel like Twitch runs in a bubble compared to the rest of Amazon.

679
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:14,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a little weird that they don't try to find opportunities to help each other, especially when it comes to things like things like Luna, and their push into cloud gaming, Prime Gaming and all this.

680
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:20,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just wild to me how that stuff isn't consistent, which is so strange to me.

681
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:20,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So

682
00:47:22,093 --> 00:47:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster in chat says my guess is that Amazon looks at the Twitch silo and wonders what else could be actually making money with that infrastructure versus what is sitting there now.

683
00:47:32,188 --> 00:47:33,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Twitch.

684
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:45,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch has communities and influencers of varying degrees that can get people to listen, you know, and, and, you know, think and sometimes act.

685
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:50,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't try to leverage more in the sponsorships and all that for it.

686
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:58,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe I should have put this in my predictions, but I do think, I think at some point you're going to have to have a Twitch Pro membership in order to be able to stream.

687
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:02,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to charge people to stream.

688
00:48:03,411 --> 00:48:05,873
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't make enough money on that platform to do that.

689
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:11,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's what I'm saying is like, you can try to do that and your platform will die immediately.

690
00:48:11,737 --> 00:48:12,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

691
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:15,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because I feel like that's I know, I know.

692
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:31,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everybody's groaning, but take that prediction the way that Matt brought up the Bobby Kotick thing earlier, because I see that that's going to be like the Hail Mary thing is that you have to be either like Amazon Prime or Twitch Pro in order to be able to stream on the service.

693
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:37,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, let me pay for the privilege to make you money.

694
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:41,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, this is no, it's not going to happen.

695
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:44,722
[SPEAKER_03]: S2100mat says, I don't see Amazon selling or killing off Twitch.

696
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see them buying outside investors.

697
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:51,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I can think of a certain private investment fund that everyone hates that would buy more shares of Amazon.

698
00:48:55,563 --> 00:49:00,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And how on earth is the green site making money?

699
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:01,146
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

700
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,067
[SPEAKER_03]: How on earth is the other site?

701
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

702
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking about the one that starts with a K?

703
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:07,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

704
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

705
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:09,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.

706
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:10,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

707
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:10,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they are.

708
00:49:11,403 --> 00:49:16,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm like, if they're if they're not losing money that site.

709
00:49:16,044 --> 00:49:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the thing is like everyone's saying that they're profitable, but they're not.

710
00:49:19,946 --> 00:49:30,809
[SPEAKER_02]: They're paying like millions of dollars to get people on the platform, but they don't have advertisers, especially since the platform touts itself on being like uncensored.

711
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who's going to really want to advertise on there?

712
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can tell you who's going to advertise on there.

713
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Gambling.

714
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:34,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

715
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:34,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

716
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:44,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I don't think that's going to be around very long either.

717
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:46,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the bubble breaks on that one.

718
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it bursts, it bursts quickly and without warning.

719
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are going to be very disappointed.

720
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:56,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I'm not completely trying to shit on that site.

721
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:04,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize there are some fine folks that have decided to take a stab on a new venture because, you know, and I respect that and so forth.

722
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:05,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think

723
00:50:07,153 --> 00:50:08,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what we should have done.

724
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,614
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the predictions would have been...

725
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:40,454
[SPEAKER_02]: that by the end of this year Twitch fully embraces adult content with its own like sectioned off section because they're they're dabbling with it but and I think that's gonna be hard for them to ignore that kind of money.

726
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:45,893
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster, you know, and in fairness, I think this is this is a fair perspective.

727
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:54,156
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we say we're the show where every gamer has a voice because sometimes y'all lend some excellent thoughts to the suggestion and QuestBuster, sometimes you don't, but this one is.

728
00:50:54,156 --> 00:51:02,498
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster says, or another perspective, casinos in Vegas survived the pandemic because of how deep their pockets are.

729
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:05,299
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting, though?

730
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:09,080
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Vegas now, versus before the pandemic,

731
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:17,210
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, at least for me personally, after this last trip to Vegas, I don't want to go back.

732
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now Vegas is starting to nickel and dime for the stupidest shit.

733
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:25,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They're charging for parking in Vegas now.

734
00:51:25,073 --> 00:51:29,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when that was free to entice you to park at the casino to gamble money there?

735
00:51:29,355 --> 00:51:34,337
[SPEAKER_03]: The, you would, I could eat a meal cheaper at Disneyland.

736
00:51:34,337 --> 00:51:35,157
[SPEAKER_03]: True story.

737
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I live, this is not hyperbole.

738
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:43,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate a meal at Disneyland cheaper than eating at Panda Express at the Venetian.

739
00:52:02,648 --> 00:52:05,069
[SPEAKER_02]: They're charging like hundreds of dollars for tickets.

740
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:08,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who's going to go watch a short movie for hundreds of dollars?

741
00:52:08,411 --> 00:52:12,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, that's why the bubbles I think you're starting to see.

742
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:17,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair to QuestBuster, it's not like Vegas suddenly shuts down.

743
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:21,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But QuestBuster, I want you to look at another and everybody.

744
00:52:21,857 --> 00:52:23,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, QuestBuster, I'm not picking on you.

745
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:25,099
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually give great insight here.

746
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that's thinking about this, look at that.

747
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to look at what happens, what's happening in Reno, Nevada.

748
00:52:33,203 --> 00:52:35,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Die at Vegas.

749
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it's not Vegas.

750
00:52:38,432 --> 00:52:42,099
[SPEAKER_03]: You told me we were gonna go to Vegas, but instead we went to Reno.

751
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at what's happened in Reno.

752
00:52:44,997 --> 00:52:49,180
[SPEAKER_03]: because the bubble on the gambling and all that kind of has burst in Reno.

753
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know why?

754
00:52:50,261 --> 00:53:00,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Because California does allow gambling on and well, it's it's part this and part this, but California does allow gambling within Native American land.

755
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:08,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are and you know, there's at least what five really rich resort casinos in this area that we live in.

756
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:12,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of folks in the Bay Area, this area, they don't go to Reno to gamble anymore.

757
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:13,180
[SPEAKER_03]: They can do it here.

758
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bubbles kind of burst on gambling.

759
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:19,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And Reno is having to kind of reinvent itself as a tech hub.

760
00:53:19,746 --> 00:53:21,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you see Reno kind of becoming now.

761
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:23,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it still has Circus Circus.

762
00:53:23,649 --> 00:53:27,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But Hera's fucking closed.

763
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:36,682
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a that's like the place Jay Leno, Jode Rivers, you know, despite whatever you think of these comedians, these were huge comics, the 80s, these are huge shows, the bubbles burst.

764
00:53:37,549 --> 00:54:02,428
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think for sure what an icon and while I don't think Vegas is going to meet the same fate I really don't I think Vegas is always going to have that sense of excess and you know all that stuff I do think there's going to be a pushback on this whole like whatever happened to doing Vegas fucking cheap because that used to be the draw for Reno as well whatever happened to just fucking doing cheap shit in Reno and then it wasn't so cheap anymore and

765
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:04,937
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

766
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:05,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

767
00:54:05,297 --> 00:54:07,898
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that's still cheap in Reno?

768
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:10,758
[SPEAKER_03]: $5.99 steak and eggs at the Calneva.

769
00:54:10,758 --> 00:54:16,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever in your life eat $5.99 steak and eggs?

770
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,720
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

771
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what resort is still open?

772
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:24,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Calneva.

773
00:54:24,981 --> 00:54:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that is infamously the Trashy Dumpy place?

774
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:30,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Still there.

775
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:30,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

776
00:54:30,983 --> 00:54:32,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Trashy Dumpy reputation.

777
00:54:33,806 --> 00:54:36,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, just some thoughts.

778
00:54:36,627 --> 00:54:41,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, um, how did we get from layoffs to talking about CalNeva?

779
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Only here on Orange Lounge Radio would that happen.

780
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:48,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but- It was, well, let's see, we talked Twitch, the kick, to gambling- I know, I know.

781
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:54,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So my point is that I don't want to make light of this because obviously, you know, this this story sucks.

782
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go back to the predictions at the top of the show.

783
00:54:57,783 --> 00:55:03,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to really hope for these folks that there can be some diamonds made out of this coal.

784
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:10,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, you know, the nice thing about the gaming industry is that you can be empowered to do this on your own.

785
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:17,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope people that have had to bear the brunt of these layoffs are and I know not everybody's going to have the means to do it, but I hope those that do

786
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:24,479
[SPEAKER_03]: are able to create a really awesome indie game and a new studio.

787
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:32,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that is one thing you do hear about also in this industry, a lot of new studios that opened up people that used to work at another place.

788
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:40,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope this is a rebirth of some really cool studios that make some really fun games.

789
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else I can say on that because otherwise, it's pretty dreary.

790
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:49,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But, if these big studios get caught doing- if they get caught cutting quarters with AI...

791
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:52,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom New Year New DRM

792
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:22,505
[SPEAKER_03]: A new update for Resident Evil Revelations added more software to prevent modding.

793
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:27,106
[SPEAKER_03]: You want nude Resident Evil characters too bad.

794
00:56:27,106 --> 00:56:39,711
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pissing off Capcom's community because of course there's a lot of people that make mods and not just I obviously we always joke about nude mods, but there's a variety of mods out there in the community of all sorts.

795
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:42,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is pissing the modding community off.

796
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:50,003
[SPEAKER_03]: In October, Capcom published a developer video where the company said, mods are no different from cheating.

797
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:51,203
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember that?

798
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:55,605
[SPEAKER_03]: There was that whole to-do where they were like, mods are basically cheating.

799
00:56:55,605 --> 00:57:03,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was some interesting, like, clickbaitiness to that, but that, that, some are saying that was the smoke before this fire here.

800
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:24,532
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course also what happened is that you had that tournament that happened recently where they were playing Street Fighter and then oops Chun-Li's naked oops all boobs that mod was installed on the Street Fighter and that did not look great because that was being streamed on Twitch and all that stuff

801
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:32,858
[SPEAKER_03]: About a month ago, Capcom started to do takedown notices on Monster Hunter videos which either featured a mod, mentioned a mod.

802
00:57:32,858 --> 00:57:39,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom Japan was going after Sunbreak videos on YouTube if you were running a mod, and it was takedown requests, copyright strikes.

803
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:51,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom added a piece of software called Enigma to a back catalog of games on the PC.

804
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Enigma can be used as DRM software.

805
00:57:54,297 --> 00:58:02,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It does appear that what is happening here is that modders are being prevented from affecting the .exe or executable file.

806
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:12,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other titles include Mega Man Zero and ZX Legacy Collection, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, Resident Evil Revelations, and so forth.

807
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:20,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Since then, what's interesting, there's been a forum exchange that happened, and the patch was recently removed.

808
00:58:20,703 --> 00:58:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom said, due to an issue observed with the latest update released, we have reverted the corresponding update.

809
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:32,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We apologize for the inconvenience caused, and once the issue is resolved, we will re-release the update.

810
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't say what that is, but... I think because the issue that I heard about that was that it was preventing games from running on the Steam Deck.

811
00:58:43,382 --> 00:58:46,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, not great.

812
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:52,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at least I think I've seen some screenshots regarding that and it was it was because of that update.

813
00:58:52,669 --> 00:58:58,413
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's stupid, like, like, especially a lot of games.

814
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:03,797
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of those like copy protection and anti piracy and anti cheating software.

815
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:22,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they are pretty exclusionary when it comes to Unix systems as well, which is a big reason why some of, like many, like Dead by Daylight for the longest time wouldn't run on Steam Deck because, uh, the anti-cheat that it uses, um, won't run on Unix-based systems.

816
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:32,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, although now that it's running on, uh, on, uh, Linux, a Linux system, I don't see any reason why they can't do a native macOS version, but that's a different story.

817
00:59:33,368 --> 00:59:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: This just, it's just such an overreaction, I think, on Capcom's part.

818
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:46,636
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're pissed about the Tiddy mod, then that's an issue with that particular tournament, and what went wrong with that tournament allowing that software to run.

819
00:59:46,636 --> 00:59:49,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that Capcom needs to take up with that tournament.

820
00:59:49,757 --> 01:00:00,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, this type of overreach of, now we gotta disable every mod that does anything in the game, is, it just strikes me as very, oh, I don't know,

821
01:00:01,784 --> 01:00:08,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna delete PictoChat off of every 3DS because a child might see a phallic drawing.

822
01:00:08,128 --> 01:00:23,379
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a lot of like people that have that kind of take where like, for example, even not necessarily with cheating, but like in Minecraft, one of the takes as well, we feel that villagers are too OP, they're too overpowered, their trades

823
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:24,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

824
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling that it's too overpowered.

825
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like then just don't play that way.

826
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Why ruin it for everybody else?

827
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:52,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course the game companies, they do that.

828
01:00:52,177 --> 01:00:56,422
[SPEAKER_02]: They just ruin it for everybody else because that's what they're exactly what they're doing right now.

829
01:00:56,422 --> 01:01:00,627
[SPEAKER_02]: More gameplay equals a grindier experience for whatever reason.

830
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:14,828
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Capcom just announced a new Monster Hunter game not that long ago, and if you piss off your community, and they're pissing off the Monster Hunter community with this, that's not a good look for pushing pre-orders for your game.

831
01:01:14,828 --> 01:01:19,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably want to stew on that a little bit, Capcom.

832
01:01:19,511 --> 01:01:24,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like 2024 is going to be a year of fuck around and find out for some of these big companies.

833
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:24,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

834
01:01:27,113 --> 01:01:34,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just wishful thinking on the accountability front, but I really feel like fuckaroundfindout is going to take on a whole new meaning this year.

835
01:01:34,377 --> 01:01:38,019
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people threatening things.

836
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:40,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, if this company does this, then I'm not going to support them.

837
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to fucking do it.

838
01:01:42,581 --> 01:01:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to fucking do it.

839
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:46,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they just go and buy their game and they're like, well,

840
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:49,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Backlash was hardly anything.

841
01:01:49,761 --> 01:02:02,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really see the point though, because to me, like, it's not ruining the, like, say you're modding these games, it's not ruining the balance of these games or anything, like, who cares?

842
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:06,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with old back catalog games, like, I don't understand what the point is.

843
01:02:07,443 --> 01:02:09,205
[SPEAKER_02]: in preventing modding on these.

844
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:12,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it really, like, disparaging your name?

845
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:21,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just because someone makes a nude mod for Street Fighter, I'm not gonna be, like, thinking, oh, Capcom and their perverted game with nudity in it.

846
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not an idiot.

847
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:25,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a lot of idiots out there, but...

848
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like the impact from that is so nothing.

849
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:32,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just not gonna be a thing.

850
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:40,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do agree, because look at what, you know, we just talked about all the Steamboat Willie stuff, which by the way, that all seemed to disappear this week, which is lovely.

851
01:02:41,918 --> 01:02:48,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, now that Steamboat Willie's public domain, you know, somebody's drawn Mickey Mouse's dong and all this stuff.

852
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:49,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's out there.

853
01:02:49,482 --> 01:02:49,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the internet.

854
01:02:49,963 --> 01:02:50,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, just now.

855
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:53,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Steam public domain hasn't stopped people from pulling that.

856
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:57,867
[SPEAKER_03]: But my point is, none of that, like, people are able to separate that.

857
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:59,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I saw a dong.

858
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:01,289
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Disney's fault?

859
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:02,069
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

860
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,030
[SPEAKER_03]: People know the difference.

861
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Winnie the Pooh is a killer because that movie

862
01:03:07,432 --> 01:03:08,313
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

863
01:03:08,313 --> 01:03:10,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, reasonable people know the difference.

864
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:14,135
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be unreasonable people.

865
01:03:14,135 --> 01:03:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.

866
01:03:16,076 --> 01:03:19,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop amplifying them.

867
01:03:19,238 --> 01:03:20,759
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be unreasonable people.

868
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:24,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop amplifying them.

869
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:25,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

870
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,902
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

871
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:30,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, let's move on to something else.

872
01:03:30,904 --> 01:03:34,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else big that's been happening this week, actually, DarkSakura.

873
01:03:36,107 --> 01:03:42,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has done some teases, teases, teases, teases.

874
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:47,830
[SPEAKER_05]: They have made mention of Gravity Rush as a movie.

875
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:54,472
[SPEAKER_05]: They've put out some of the artwork and the teaser for it at CES 2024.

876
01:03:59,142 --> 01:04:02,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's going to be pretty neat.

877
01:04:02,284 --> 01:04:16,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have like, I guess it's assumed that it's Cat from Gravity Rush is jumping toward a dragon and shows some mocap stuff and all kinds of interesting things.

878
01:04:16,473 --> 01:04:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And then something else for a Patapon project.

879
01:04:21,996 --> 01:04:26,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it shows the Patapons fighting a mammoth and then

880
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's interesting.

881
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:36,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all 3D, of course, not like the original Patapon was.

882
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:40,507
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could be interesting.

883
01:04:40,507 --> 01:04:43,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I will, of course, reserve my judgment for when I have something more to judge.

884
01:04:45,868 --> 01:04:48,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, some pretty light teases there on the CES front.

885
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:54,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, again, CES is not supposed to be a gaming announcement thing.

886
01:04:54,433 --> 01:05:02,878
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes you get a little bit, and especially because if you go way, way back, E3 originally was a spinoff of CES.

887
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:04,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just kind of curious if maybe E3

888
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,241
[SPEAKER_03]: passing away was going to cause CES to maybe absorb a little bit.

889
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:12,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's too soon, maybe next year.

890
01:05:12,043 --> 01:05:15,424
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have little bits from Sony, little bits.

891
01:05:15,424 --> 01:05:29,850
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another little tidbit, although just if it wasn't on anyone's radar, because this has been out on the web for a while, is that there was a Kickstarter for a sequel to Patapon called Ratatan.

892
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember seeing that.

893
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:35,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked cool.

894
01:05:35,052 --> 01:05:35,352
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

895
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:45,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it was mentioned in chat, Dr. Tia says, we usually get Arcade 1UP announcements, but I don't think they had anything this year.

896
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:50,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently, I have not heard of Arcade 1UP doing anything.

897
01:05:50,582 --> 01:05:56,924
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, I'm looking at the Reddit for Arcade 1UP and there's, you know, insiders that are saying they're not announcing anything at CES 2024.

898
01:05:56,924 --> 01:06:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, the timing's not right.

899
01:06:00,325 --> 01:06:04,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like.

900
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

901
01:06:05,456 --> 01:06:10,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, another controversy brewing in the community, Loki.

902
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this is kind of adjacent to what SAG-AFTRA was just dealing with with their strikes in regards to AI and replicating voice actors or actors, I guess.

903
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:49,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So now apparently they've signed a deal, or SAG-AFTRA has, they're engaging with a company called Replica Studios, who will basically allow folks to use actors who have licensed their likeness in voice to be used with the studio to generate dialogue.

904
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:54,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's some actors are very, apparently it's not a,

905
01:06:55,558 --> 01:07:08,763
[SPEAKER_02]: popular opinion because there's actors basically responding back with this announcement like saying, excuse me, you know, you say approved by the affected members of the union's voiceover performer community.

906
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:11,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody in our community has approved this that I know of.

907
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Games are a bulk of my livelihood and have been for years.

908
01:07:15,085 --> 01:07:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you referring to?

909
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:20,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who is basically, you know, giving you the okay for this?

910
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:21,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, um,

911
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:33,506
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, from voice actor Elias to Fexus, basically said, I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors in games.

912
01:07:33,506 --> 01:07:34,707
[SPEAKER_02]: No one asked me about this.

913
01:07:34,707 --> 01:07:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: No one reached out for my opinion.

914
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:39,172
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've seen, no one asked any of my peers either.

915
01:07:39,172 --> 01:07:40,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, they're

916
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like they're moving ahead without getting the input from their members.

917
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But I assume they're going to work this all out.

918
01:07:47,698 --> 01:08:06,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But once again, stuff like this and the whole stuff with some of the AI image generators, especially nowadays, where they're finding out that, hey, look, if I put this prompt in, I can get something that looks exactly like a frame of video from a major Hollywood movie.

919
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're saying that this is okay?

920
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:21,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because clearly it's violating copyright because they were trained on copyrighted materials because there's no way they'd be able to mimic it down to it almost being a one-to-one exact frame from a movie.

921
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:26,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if they put the prompt in, they go find a frame of that movie that matches that almost identically.

922
01:08:27,611 --> 01:08:36,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I brought this up last week because I'm friends with a few folks and definitely the complaining is loud.

923
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:42,067
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basically saying this is what we were striking against and you're going behind our back doing this.

924
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:42,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

925
01:08:43,180 --> 01:09:07,012
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah um and and on top of that i mean i'm sure y'all saw the thing about them doing a george carlin special without george carlin that is christ that is that's awful yeah and and that guy should be sued the person that put that on youtube should be sued by george carlin's estate his daughter commented on it commenting on it's not enough legal action needs to be taken

926
01:09:07,665 --> 01:09:08,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I listened to some of it.

927
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:10,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to listen to some of it.

928
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,610
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something missing.

929
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:41,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the voice does sound like him, and the jokes sound like jokes he would have made, but there's just something that's way off about it.

930
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:47,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, even if I didn't know it was an AI, there's, like, a quality.

931
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:51,045
[SPEAKER_05]: that's missing, certain inflections that are missing.

932
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:53,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I know certainly you can hear when an audience is pieced in.

933
01:09:53,806 --> 01:10:12,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know if it's actually AI generating the voice or if it's AI generating the visuals for it because I believe that the voice is done by Will Sasso because they had an interview with him and he said that he had studied to learn to do an impression of him and wanted to do all that.

934
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:13,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't

935
01:10:13,857 --> 01:10:21,343
[SPEAKER_02]: certain that he trained like an AI thing to replicate it with like mimicking his voice.

936
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:24,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You would think that would be just easier just to get the live.

937
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:26,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't sound like a human.

938
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:26,548
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

939
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:27,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's.

940
01:10:28,618 --> 01:10:30,099
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not there yet, but it's hopeful.

941
01:10:50,899 --> 01:10:53,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the union made a hasty decision.

942
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:58,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they are a little bit fearful of how fast AI is progressing.

943
01:10:58,284 --> 01:11:01,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that extent, I understand.

944
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:06,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they hastily, and this is where I think I don't understand, made a deal with this one organization.

945
01:11:06,991 --> 01:11:09,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand actors can like opt out of it and stuff.

946
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:10,673
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot like it's not like

947
01:11:11,654 --> 01:11:17,519
[SPEAKER_03]: What this deal doesn't do, it doesn't mean that every voice actor out there automatically has to submit to AI.

948
01:11:17,519 --> 01:11:17,840
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

949
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows this one company to be able to do it.

950
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:30,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like SAG-AFTRA kind of entered into this deal to sort of stop the AI thing from growing out of control.

951
01:11:30,651 --> 01:11:37,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not excusing it, but what I'm saying is that the lesson to be learned here, and I think what's happening and you're hearing the voice actors kind of push back, is that

952
01:11:37,697 --> 01:11:43,118
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like they feel like this decision was made so hastily their voice was not in the room.

953
01:11:43,118 --> 01:11:45,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, negotiators made this decision on their behalf.

954
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:53,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like a lot of voice actors really wish they had been consulted or they had been in the room or they were allowed to get their input on this situation that didn't happen.

955
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:55,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a union problem.

956
01:11:55,381 --> 01:12:01,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of people who were already like saying, you know, if this doesn't get rectified, I'm tearing up the card.

957
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:05,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand.

958
01:12:05,017 --> 01:12:06,457
[SPEAKER_03]: You want your union to represent you.

959
01:12:06,457 --> 01:12:10,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they don't represent you, why are you paying the dues?

960
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:18,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it looks like there's already a call for another strike and this time striking the union.

961
01:12:18,641 --> 01:12:21,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this could get interesting.

962
01:12:21,222 --> 01:12:21,902
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

963
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

964
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:30,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll have to ask a couple of a couple of of my friends and see if they have anything to say about anything that I could say.

965
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:32,626
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll ask a couple of folks.

966
01:12:32,626 --> 01:12:32,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

967
01:12:33,366 --> 01:12:38,949
[SPEAKER_03]: or peek at Twitter too, you know, there's a few voice actors out there that are very vocal about all of this.

968
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:40,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's basically where my friends still are.

969
01:12:40,509 --> 01:12:41,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

970
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:44,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

971
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:54,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, speaking of people talking about things, let's talk about Yoshi P, the director behind Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XVI, Naoki Yoshida, who's known as Yoshi P.

972
01:12:56,617 --> 01:13:10,733
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been asked about Final Fantasy XVII, because, you know, XVI's out, the DLC is, you know, the first part's out, the second part will be out at some point, but I think now the world is ready to hear about Final Fantasy XVII, or asking this sort of thing.

973
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:15,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So, somebody straight up asked him, Yoshi-P, are you doing Final Fantasy XVII?

974
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:16,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you directing it?

975
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:20,904
[SPEAKER_03]: YoshiP hesitated and said he's on the board of directors now.

976
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:24,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So he didn't give a clear answer to the question, which is interesting.

977
01:13:24,587 --> 01:13:31,374
[SPEAKER_03]: But what he did say, which then because you know, the interview, you would usually read into that, well, yes, he's doing it because he's not saying anything about it.

978
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:38,141
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he said, maybe it's time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one.

979
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:50,278
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I think in some ways it would be good to look to the future and bring in a younger generation with more youthful sensibilities to make a new Final Fantasy with challenges that suit today's world.

980
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:58,387
[SPEAKER_03]: A good follow-up question he was asked after that would be, what advice would you give to that younger Final Fantasy XVII director?

981
01:13:58,387 --> 01:14:04,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, Final Fantasy is about challenging what's been done before.

982
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:10,573
[SPEAKER_03]: While I'm certainly not looking to pick a fight with the older games, we all make Final Fantasy games thinking, mine will be the most fun.

983
01:14:10,573 --> 01:14:18,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So my advice is to just dive in and first put down on paper what you believe would be the most enjoyable Final Fantasy before thinking too hard about it.

984
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Then from there, you can decide things like, since 16 was real-time action, my Final Fantasy is going to have both real-time action and turn-based battles.

985
01:14:27,979 --> 01:14:33,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could go the other extreme and return it to its fully turn-based pixel art roots.

986
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,520
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be groundbreaking.

987
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you could.

988
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,641
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

989
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:43,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bring it back to turn-based, because turn-based... What's interesting is a lot of sites are now running the headline.

990
01:14:43,122 --> 01:14:47,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoshi P says Final Fantasy 17 could go back to its pixel-based roots.

991
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:49,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

992
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:11,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be cool, but I also kind of feel like the door is open for that to be expressed in other ways, and that would be direct sequels to things like Final Fantasy IV.

993
01:15:11,442 --> 01:15:15,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not do a Final Fantasy V, too, after all these years?

994
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I think revisiting V's old job system—I mean, I'm basically explaining Bravely Default.

995
01:15:21,024 --> 01:15:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think going back and exploring Final Fantasy V's job system, all that would be like a lot of fun.

996
01:15:25,986 --> 01:15:32,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not go back and revisit some of the old pixel based games and make like, you know, a more direct sequel?

997
01:15:32,169 --> 01:15:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they did do that with Final Fantasy IV The After Years, you know, before somebody corrects me on that.

998
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,191
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I think it'd be fun to see some of that.

999
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:41,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Final Fantasy XVII can be something new.

1000
01:15:41,012 --> 01:15:42,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it has to necessarily be retro.

1001
01:15:44,234 --> 01:15:47,838
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% but I do love the idea of going back to a turn-based game.

1002
01:15:47,838 --> 01:15:50,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people would be very happy.

1003
01:15:50,782 --> 01:15:54,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be on board because I haven't picked up the real creative direction.

1004
01:15:54,866 --> 01:15:57,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But also to YoshiP's credit, I think it's

1005
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the fact that he would say, maybe it shouldn't be me, maybe it should be somebody younger, is a lot of the reason why a lot of people really like Yoshi P. I also don't think he should sell himself short.

1006
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if he does want to do it, he should.

1007
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:21,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, as much of a fan as I am of his and what he's done for 14, and I mostly like 16.

1008
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:26,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my issues with it, but it was certainly better than 15, and there was a lot more good than there was bad.

1009
01:16:26,605 --> 01:16:27,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1010
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:29,307
[SPEAKER_03]: It gave the world Ben Starr.

1011
01:16:29,307 --> 01:16:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And isn't that enough?

1012
01:16:31,067 --> 01:16:49,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So with all that in mind, I'm fine if somebody else takes on 17 or whatever, but I'm glad YoshiP is on the board of directors, because that's the voice we need in the room, I think.

1013
01:16:49,006 --> 01:16:51,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I like him.

1014
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:53,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a voice we need in the room, as far as I'm concerned.

1015
01:16:55,123 --> 01:17:00,505
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, I don't know, still waiting for 6.2.

1016
01:17:00,505 --> 01:17:03,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think a lot of people would love to see that someday.

1017
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:06,968
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100Matt says, Preach, Rob, Final Fantasy Remake and Reimagining would be nice.

1018
01:17:06,968 --> 01:17:09,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's like a forgotten game.

1019
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:11,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's see.

1020
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:15,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Asiya Tabiri says, Screw it, make 17 a text-based MMO.

1021
01:17:15,592 --> 01:17:19,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And Orangerite says, 17 is a BBS door game, essentially.

1022
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:22,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love that.

1023
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:23,701
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

1024
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:26,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Rite brings up a good comparison, though.

1025
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:30,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XVII going the Mega Man 9 route?

1026
01:17:31,383 --> 01:17:35,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifth Dream is saying he can't work on 2 MMOs, so he's gotta let new people work on 17.

1027
01:17:35,227 --> 01:17:39,792
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a pattern theorist, what I mean by that is, 11 was an MMO, 14 was an MMO, 17?

1028
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:59,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Numerically could be the next MMO, could be.

1029
01:17:59,015 --> 01:17:59,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

1030
01:17:59,495 --> 01:18:09,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not be upset with another MMO, but I actually, I just, I feel like it's gonna be 18, not 17, because Final Fantasy 14's still hot.

1031
01:18:09,879 --> 01:18:20,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Square Enix doesn't totally wanna cannibalize itself, which yes, I know Final Fantasy XI fans, you have something to say about that, but XI is still existing,

1032
01:18:21,516 --> 01:18:23,657
[SPEAKER_03]: which says a lot, to be honest.

1033
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:27,800
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that Final Fantasy XI still exists is actually fucking impressive.

1034
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:35,685
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just, I feel like they're gonna ride out the, keep in mind, Final Fantasy XIV makes Square Enix a lot of money.

1035
01:18:35,685 --> 01:18:39,168
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say, I mean a lot of money.

1036
01:18:39,168 --> 01:18:43,510
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not gonna, they're gonna keep that train going for a while.

1037
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think maybe Final Fantasy XVIII, but not XVII.

1038
01:18:47,438 --> 01:18:49,078
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1039
01:18:49,078 --> 01:18:53,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

1040
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:59,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, I guess maybe DarkSakura, you could talk about another system that we could see Final Fantasy 17 on.

1041
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:02,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly so, although I highly doubt it.

1042
01:19:02,662 --> 01:19:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone remember the Atari 400?

1043
01:19:05,002 --> 01:19:05,682
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1044
01:19:05,682 --> 01:19:12,124
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, well, you know, they had to, there was the 800, you know, and before that was the 400.

1045
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:16,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was an early Atari computer.

1046
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:24,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It had controller jacks in front, one of those little, like, Odyssey 2-style keyboards on it, you know?

1047
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:29,180
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all just a plastic panel over switches.

1048
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's an announcement now for the Atari 400 Mini.

1049
01:19:34,845 --> 01:19:38,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about half the size of the original, which did come out in 1978.

1050
01:19:38,267 --> 01:19:46,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has the updated version of the CX-40 Atari joystick.

1051
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:49,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will work with USB.

1052
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use other devices with it.

1053
01:19:51,977 --> 01:19:54,778
[SPEAKER_05]: It has five USB ports.

1054
01:19:54,778 --> 01:19:59,562
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use external keyboards and sideload games and you name it.

1055
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:04,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And an HDMI port so you can hook it up to a TV or monitor.

1056
01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:27,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 25 titles already on it from the 8-bit era of Atari, and it has things like Berserk, Millipede, Miner, 24Niner, Mule, Star Raiders 2, and it has save states and rewinds and

1057
01:20:28,363 --> 01:20:31,084
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds of stuff and this is by Retro Games.

1058
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:35,066
[SPEAKER_05]: The same ones also did the mini Amiga 500 and Commodore 64.

1059
01:20:35,066 --> 01:20:40,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say this thing very much fits the Commodore 64 mini template.

1060
01:20:40,868 --> 01:20:43,869
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a bad thing.

1061
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:45,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can order it.

1062
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It's set for release on March 28 for $119.99.

1063
01:20:53,362 --> 01:20:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says I'm excited about this and I already pre-ordered it.

1064
01:20:57,745 --> 01:21:01,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an obscure Atari console compared to the others, but I'm all for it.

1065
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:05,812
[SPEAKER_03]: The Atari 400 was the first console my family got before I was born.

1066
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:07,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Still have my Atari 400 and it works.

1067
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:14,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's going to be enough people in SSJ100 Matt's boat that like have the nostalgia thing that this is going to do well.

1068
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:15,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like a cute device.

1069
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you can sideload

1070
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:20,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that the company, you know, they did this with the C64 mini as well.

1071
01:21:20,562 --> 01:21:22,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that they're not shying away from that.

1072
01:21:22,183 --> 01:21:25,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great.

1073
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,385
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1074
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:28,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you might get one, DarkSakura?

1075
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:31,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, Atari 400 is not really your jam.

1076
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:32,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I linked it to Dan.

1077
01:21:32,547 --> 01:21:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It could happen.

1078
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't need one.

1079
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:37,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest.

1080
01:21:37,089 --> 01:21:40,511
[SPEAKER_05]: But also lately, I've been kind of focused in different areas.

1081
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:41,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1082
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:45,169
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well back to the current era.

1083
01:21:45,169 --> 01:21:50,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, I have like most of those games on damn near 50,000.

1084
01:21:50,636 --> 01:21:53,260
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those games were multi platform.

1085
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:56,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of any of those games you named were like exclusive to the Atari 400.

1086
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:58,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really can't think of any.

1087
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so Suicide Squad, as you remember, it's been delayed to, well, this year.

1088
01:22:27,355 --> 01:22:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: because, well, it needed a lot of stuff reworked.

1089
01:22:29,797 --> 01:22:43,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that came out thanks to a RockStudio dev's kind of Q&A that they were doing on their Discord is some of the changes that they are making to the actual game mechanics.

1090
01:22:43,546 --> 01:22:49,970
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those was a gear system that had like a gear score for each item.

1091
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:56,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you get a gun or whatever in the beginning of the game, you know, that gear score might be

1092
01:22:57,455 --> 01:22:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1093
01:23:13,104 --> 01:23:14,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Playstyle, I guess.

1094
01:23:14,104 --> 01:23:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever you want to equip based off of your playstyle.

1095
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Which sounds to me a little bit more like how Borderlands does things, but it's still stats.

1096
01:23:22,368 --> 01:23:27,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, honestly, DPS and all that stuff, it's just looking at stats.

1097
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:30,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things that they've been tweaking with it.

1098
01:23:30,951 --> 01:23:33,152
[SPEAKER_02]: The other stuff, I have no idea.

1099
01:23:33,152 --> 01:23:35,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not super excited about this game.

1100
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:37,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, honestly, it doesn't look great.

1101
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:41,655
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is not reading well.

1102
01:23:41,655 --> 01:23:48,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the right trailer comes out, the right preview video that starts to change minds, and I'm going to hope for the developers' sake that's what happens.

1103
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:53,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it feels very Crackdown to me.

1104
01:23:53,538 --> 01:24:01,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Crackdown 3, it feels very Crackdown 3, actually, to me, because Crackdown was... I loved Crackdown.

1105
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,520
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great game.

1106
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:02,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1107
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that you said that, I'm like, Phil Spencer, we need to have a talk.

1108
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:10,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Crackdown 3, though, just missed the mark.

1109
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:13,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it wasn't as good as the other stuff.

1110
01:24:13,566 --> 01:24:16,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that didn't stop them from trying to do another Saints Row game.

1111
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:18,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should it stop Crackdown?

1112
01:24:18,147 --> 01:24:19,108
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it shouldn't.

1113
01:24:19,108 --> 01:24:24,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just that they kind of tweaked some stuff that just didn't work out.

1114
01:24:24,249 --> 01:24:27,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they could do something, you know, it just feels...

1115
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:32,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the problem with the new Crackdown is it felt very generic.

1116
01:24:32,335 --> 01:24:39,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it felt like a very generic type of game, whereas the first couple Crackdowns felt kind of unique.

1117
01:24:39,018 --> 01:24:41,360
[SPEAKER_02]: This feels very generic.

1118
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:47,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I understand that, like, Rocksteady's got, you know, they got the good characters with DC and stuff, and I like Suicide Squad.

1119
01:24:47,943 --> 01:24:49,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting.

1120
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:51,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, they're...

1121
01:24:53,001 --> 01:25:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: really genericizing the whole thing like even going back to how it was originally where it's like okay yeah you've got Harley Quinn and all these you know characters from the Suicide Squad and we're gonna give them guns and we're gonna totally strip out anything that has to do with those individual characters like they don't have unique weapons or gameplay styles or anything like that they're all gonna be the same there's just gonna be different skins and that that's what makes it feel so generic because when people want to play like

1122
01:25:21,295 --> 01:25:23,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what they missed the mark with.

1123
01:25:23,098 --> 01:25:25,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're trying to walk back to that, but...

1124
01:25:39,784 --> 01:25:42,848
[SPEAKER_02]: They already have this shell of a game that they've made.

1125
01:25:42,848 --> 01:25:47,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to drastically change up how that plays.

1126
01:25:47,154 --> 01:25:49,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just going to feel very generic.

1127
01:25:49,356 --> 01:25:51,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think it's going to work out.

1128
01:25:51,636 --> 01:25:58,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SJ100Mad is pointing out in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, it's also the live service aspect that's kind of a big draw as well.

1129
01:25:58,638 --> 01:26:08,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop, like with the live service games, like, you know, going back to the predictions, I think, I think one that the live service thing, I think one of these games turns to AI to try to fill it out.

1130
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they get fucking blasted for it.

1131
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:15,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing, like, um, here's this car crash happening in slow motion.

1132
01:26:16,044 --> 01:26:28,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so one of the, remember we talked about game leaks and stuff like that with Insomniac games or whatever, how their information leaked.

1133
01:26:28,597 --> 01:26:35,545
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that leaked from that was a presentation that was given showing the number of players and time.

1134
01:26:36,426 --> 01:26:59,725
[SPEAKER_02]: players spent on multiplayer versus single-player games and apparently single-player games have been players have been spending a lot more time in single-player games than multiplayer overall so that whole like oh no one plays single-player games anymore everyone needs to do live service things not true just companies like it because they can make a ton of money off of it that's it

1135
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:00,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I

1136
01:27:17,682 --> 01:27:19,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, well, you know what?

1137
01:27:19,243 --> 01:27:32,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a story of a game that, you know, it was a game that just kind of literally came out of nowhere, and it did pretty amazing things, and now it's going to continue to do amazing things, which led to one of my predictions earlier.

1138
01:27:32,575 --> 01:27:37,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi-Fi Rush, which of course came from Bethesda, which is part of an Xbox studio at this point,

1139
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:45,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming to the Nintendo Switch if you would believe video game rating leaks, which are pretty good barometer, to be honest.

1140
01:27:45,262 --> 01:27:46,903
[SPEAKER_03]: They oftentimes are true.

1141
01:27:46,903 --> 01:27:51,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the game was rated in Australia for the Nintendo Switch.

1142
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:54,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It was classified as M because it has fantasy violence.

1143
01:27:54,366 --> 01:28:00,088
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know when it is coming out, but don't we have like an Xbox Direct coming up soon?

1144
01:28:00,968 --> 01:28:02,829
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever they call that.

1145
01:28:02,829 --> 01:28:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess they could announce it in a Nintendo thing instead of a Microsoft thing.

1146
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:07,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see it.

1147
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be both.

1148
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:08,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be both.

1149
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:09,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see a switch.

1150
01:28:09,511 --> 01:28:13,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The next Nintendo thing ought to be about the next Switch.

1151
01:28:13,652 --> 01:28:16,012
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not, I'm going to be very surprised.

1152
01:28:16,012 --> 01:28:18,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will start to buy in more to Loki's theory about a 2025 successor.

1153
01:28:21,975 --> 01:28:26,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could see them announcing it at a Microsoft thing.

1154
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,001
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1155
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:28,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's still really cool.

1156
01:28:28,062 --> 01:28:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, Hi-Fi Rush was a super cute game.

1157
01:28:30,766 --> 01:28:33,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's interesting that we're talking about that.

1158
01:28:33,249 --> 01:28:37,334
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, it's interesting that we're talking about this about a year after that game came out.

1159
01:28:38,786 --> 01:28:42,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like they have an exclusive window with themselves for a year or something.

1160
01:28:42,368 --> 01:28:42,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1161
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1162
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:45,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Buster says it's the 18th.

1163
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:46,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1164
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:49,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new Indiana Jones game is supposed to be talked about during the Direct 2.

1165
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:52,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder if we don't hear more about this on the 18th.

1166
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:56,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it isn't a stealth release like the original was.

1167
01:28:56,515 --> 01:28:58,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's why it's leaking this way.

1168
01:28:58,356 --> 01:28:59,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1169
01:28:59,196 --> 01:29:00,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1170
01:29:00,677 --> 01:29:01,517
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1171
01:29:01,517 --> 01:29:08,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to get into our next segment, but I'm going to set this up a little bit before I play the bumper, because we need to explain

1172
01:29:09,297 --> 01:29:15,602
[SPEAKER_03]: the 2024 twist to this segment, uh, for people that may have missed the original announcement, uh, several weeks ago.

1173
01:29:15,602 --> 01:29:27,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a segment here called the classic game of the week, but once a month, DarkSakura mixes up the formula and she does something a little different, like maybe a classic system or a classic peripheral or a soundtrack.

1174
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:32,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year, DarkSakura is mixing up the formula once again.

1175
01:29:32,013 --> 01:29:38,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we get to the bumper and the actual choice, can you, can you set the stage DarkSakura, what is this year's theme?

1176
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:53,095
[SPEAKER_05]: These are cancelled games that were either almost all complete or mostly complete, or there are complete versions out there, but for some reason or another, they just didn't come out.

1177
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:54,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a fun theme.

1178
01:29:54,775 --> 01:29:58,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised we didn't pick this one sooner, but it is what it is.

1179
01:29:58,817 --> 01:30:04,958
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so with that, I will play The Bump as I must, and we will get into the pick for this month.

1180
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:06,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Jamie, take it away, Jamie.

1181
01:30:17,529 --> 01:30:25,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1182
01:30:25,293 --> 01:30:30,096
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1183
01:30:30,096 --> 01:30:32,577
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick this week?

1184
01:30:32,577 --> 01:30:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will warn the viewers at Twitch, because these are canceled games, don't expect all-star quality footage for all of them.

1185
01:30:40,281 --> 01:30:42,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start off with that.

1186
01:30:42,122 --> 01:30:42,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1187
01:30:43,874 --> 01:30:49,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was what I could get.

1188
01:30:49,179 --> 01:30:53,283
[SPEAKER_05]: The game I chose is Capcom Fighting All-Stars.

1189
01:30:53,283 --> 01:31:00,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a cancelled 3D fighting game that was developed by Capcom for the arcade and the PlayStation 2.

1190
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:07,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have had characters from all kinds of different fighting games, including some SNK.

1191
01:31:08,717 --> 01:31:15,942
[SPEAKER_05]: and it would have introduced some new characters.

1192
01:31:15,942 --> 01:31:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, I'll just go ahead a little bit.

1193
01:31:18,664 --> 01:31:26,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It was trying to translate some mechanics from some of the 2D games into 3D, kind of how Street Fighter EX was.

1194
01:31:26,909 --> 01:31:37,917
[SPEAKER_05]: You had three life bars that would, you know, pause each time one was depleted, kind of like how Darkstalkers goes, you know, where you, you know, have that, like, reset area.

1195
01:31:38,938 --> 01:31:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have a combo gauge that if you're still on your first bar, you can only level it up to a lower tier, but the more beat up you are, the more damage you can do.

1196
01:31:53,734 --> 01:31:55,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you add finishing moves and whatnot.

1197
01:31:56,377 --> 01:32:10,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So the characters, it was intended to have 16 playable characters, 11 from Capcom games, like Final Fight and Street Fighter series, and four originals and a guest character from King of Fighters.

1198
01:32:10,423 --> 01:32:24,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So the list was Akira from Rival Schools, Akuma or Gouki from Street Fighter, Alex from Street Fighter, Street Fighter 3 series, Batsu from Rival Schools, Charlie from Street Fighter Alpha, Chun-Li,

1199
01:32:29,391 --> 01:32:45,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter, The You, Final Fight, Haggar, Dimitri from Darkstalkers, Kill from King of Fighters, Poison from Final Fight, and Strider Hiryu.

1200
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:52,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the original characters were DeeDee, Death, Luke, and Ingrid.

1201
01:32:52,783 --> 01:32:58,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And of those, only Ingrid survived this game's demise.

1202
01:32:58,785 --> 01:33:09,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, in the story, there is a terrorist named Avel, who also used Death, who is trying to destroy Metro City with a small atomic bomb called the Laughter Sun.

1203
01:33:11,571 --> 01:33:26,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you had to go fight these code holders who you would get the codes from to stop the bomb.

1204
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:27,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was...

1205
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of what had begun as a third Capcom vs. SNK.

1206
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:42,128
[SPEAKER_05]: But SNK cancelled it because, well, it actually was cancelled because of SNK facing bankruptcy.

1207
01:33:42,128 --> 01:33:51,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And so 20 of their staff members went to go work for Capcom, including the director Tanabe Toyohisa.

1208
01:33:51,474 --> 01:33:57,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So at any rate, they repurposed some of those assets into a new project that they called Capcom Fighting All-Stars.

1209
01:33:58,338 --> 01:34:09,165
[SPEAKER_05]: and they were allowed to use Kyo with permission and a special guest.

1210
01:34:09,165 --> 01:34:16,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they had some location tests between 2002 and 2003 and a lot of people left really negative feedback on the game.

1211
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:24,415
[SPEAKER_05]: They developed it a little bit more and then the game was cancelled in August 2003.

1212
01:34:24,415 --> 01:34:41,508
[SPEAKER_05]: There isn't much of the game out there until 2017 when Capcom put out an interview with Tanabe on the Street Fighter V website and he let out a little bit more information about it and let out some unpublished artwork and screenshots.

1213
01:34:42,388 --> 01:34:55,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this did, however, evolve into a different game aptly named Capcom Fighting Evolution in 2004, and it included Ingrid in its roster.

1214
01:34:55,859 --> 01:35:07,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Ingrid showed up in other games such as Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max, Project X Zone 2, and as a costume for Karin in Street Fighter V.

1215
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:20,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Ingrid, DeeDee, and Luke also had cameos in the Rhythm RPG Ultaranger that was in 2013.

1216
01:35:20,575 --> 01:35:22,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, there's the game.

1217
01:35:22,476 --> 01:35:25,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there were playable versions out there.

1218
01:35:25,097 --> 01:35:32,340
[SPEAKER_05]: People have gotten to play this game, but I've seen no ROM dumps, no nothing about this.

1219
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:37,723
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those ones that's just lost in time, but was pretty much playable.

1220
01:35:38,615 --> 01:35:42,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can see these folks location testing at one of these YouTubes here.

1221
01:35:42,558 --> 01:35:46,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like it's a fairly done game.

1222
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:52,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe the I mean, I have to remember it's of the era because I'm like, well, the backgrounds look a little plain, but, you know, it's of that era.

1223
01:35:52,406 --> 01:35:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So but it looks like it would have been fun.

1224
01:35:57,951 --> 01:35:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this was like 2002, 2003.

1225
01:35:58,911 --> 01:35:59,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going through testing.

1226
01:35:59,932 --> 01:36:02,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So consider that.

1227
01:36:02,935 --> 01:36:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1228
01:36:03,595 --> 01:36:06,958
[SPEAKER_05]: This is I would reckon around the time of Tekken Tag Tournament.

1229
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:07,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

1230
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:09,983
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah.

1231
01:36:09,983 --> 01:36:13,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a this is a great way to start it off this year's theme.

1232
01:36:13,284 --> 01:36:17,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks in chat are like, oh, SJ100 Matt says, I didn't know about this at all.

1233
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:19,406
[SPEAKER_03]: D'Artesia said this was going to be CVS3.

1234
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:20,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Disappointed gasp.

1235
01:36:20,526 --> 01:36:20,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1236
01:36:20,947 --> 01:36:22,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So some interesting.

1237
01:36:22,967 --> 01:36:24,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this could have been cool.

1238
01:36:24,308 --> 01:36:30,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting how some, you know, you kind of talked about how it did kind of evolve into something else like so.

1239
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when I think about canceled games in recent memory, I think about Blizzard's Titan project and how that ultimately gave us Overwatch.

1240
01:36:38,433 --> 01:36:45,599
[SPEAKER_03]: right so sometimes some very interesting ashes rise of you know these cancelled games so this this is fun so

1241
01:36:46,308 --> 01:36:56,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, and we actually, we had had this on our radar to play because we knew certain individuals that worked at Capcom at the time.

1242
01:36:56,752 --> 01:37:01,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it just didn't happen.

1243
01:37:01,113 --> 01:37:05,635
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it's understandable with what happened with SNK.

1244
01:37:05,635 --> 01:37:12,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I would believe that a Capcom versus SNK 3 would have turned out better.

1245
01:37:13,334 --> 01:37:15,836
[SPEAKER_05]: then what was reported with this game.

1246
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:20,239
[SPEAKER_05]: This game had like there were a lot of complaints about how this went.

1247
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:21,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was a great concept.

1248
01:37:21,559 --> 01:37:26,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd love to see them revisit it because some of those other characters like DD looks pretty freaking cool.

1249
01:37:26,923 --> 01:37:27,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1250
01:37:27,623 --> 01:37:32,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the bomb, you know, aspect to it.

1251
01:37:32,226 --> 01:37:38,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just rather people get in there and beat each other up for the shit of it, you know, and maybe get whatever happened to just beating people up for fun.

1252
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:46,709
[SPEAKER_05]: and Ryu walking away going, the fight is all.

1253
01:37:46,709 --> 01:37:49,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a little disappointed.

1254
01:37:49,589 --> 01:37:55,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have liked to have seen what this could have been and have these characters come back.

1255
01:37:55,891 --> 01:38:05,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, it would be cool if Capcom would revisit some of the other fighting game series and just do a complete all-star game that has every character.

1256
01:38:06,892 --> 01:38:11,715
[SPEAKER_05]: from fighting games that they've made and beat-em-ups that they've made.

1257
01:38:11,715 --> 01:38:23,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the full DarkSakuras cast, we have the full Street Fighter cast, we have this game's cast, we just have, and we just call it Capcom All Out Fight.

1258
01:38:23,604 --> 01:38:26,066
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Rama S. Hey, Capcom, hire me.

1259
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:31,469
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Rama S. just ran streaking through the building, screaming at the top of his lungs, Rival Schools 3.

1260
01:38:34,031 --> 01:38:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiritsu Justice Daigakuen, which would be college.

1261
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:41,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Rival universities is not just Auburn versus Alabama anymore.

1262
01:38:56,246 --> 01:39:00,527
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's cover some other quick headlines here before we get into whatever topic.

1263
01:39:00,527 --> 01:39:02,548
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to talk more about Rival Schools 3, that's fine.

1264
01:39:02,548 --> 01:39:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to your topics in a little bit.

1265
01:39:03,768 --> 01:39:09,490
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, let's do some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other headlines.

1266
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:11,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll start with you.

1267
01:39:11,091 --> 01:39:16,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller is going to be getting an update soon.

1268
01:39:16,532 --> 01:39:25,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there's story listings talking about a V2 version, which is guests expected to have better battery life.

1269
01:39:26,676 --> 01:39:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool, and it's gonna cost... looks like $89.99.

1270
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:39,424
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get a charge station with click-and-charging.

1271
01:39:39,424 --> 01:39:49,850
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Josh Hutcherson from Hunger Games, and of course Five Nights at Freddy's, saying that the sequel is getting underway

1272
01:39:51,684 --> 01:39:53,705
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1273
01:40:15,257 --> 01:40:20,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some interesting news out there.

1274
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Some more Toaplan stuff.

1275
01:40:22,961 --> 01:40:25,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know I like my Toaplan.

1276
01:40:25,242 --> 01:40:39,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So Batsugun, Fixate, TigerHeli, and Vimana are coming to PC on February 1st with the Toaplan Arcade Shoot-'em-up Collection Volume 3!

1277
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I love TigerHeli and Batsugun.

1278
01:40:43,552 --> 01:40:48,358
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's going to be out on Steam and GOG.

1279
01:40:48,358 --> 01:40:49,680
[SPEAKER_05]: The Goggle.

1280
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm going to call it from now on because I'm cool and I can make up nicknames for things.

1281
01:40:54,506 --> 01:40:57,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an industry privilege!

1282
01:40:57,911 --> 01:40:58,251
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1283
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:07,444
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see, I got one for you as well, talking a little bit about limited run games.

1284
01:41:07,444 --> 01:41:12,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some folks look forward to the things that they put out, and these are some very interesting re-releases for Switch.

1285
01:41:12,486 --> 01:41:17,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the Felix the Cat Collection, which will have the NES and the Game Boy games.

1286
01:41:17,748 --> 01:41:20,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when Felix the Cat was a game on the... Felix the Cat?

1287
01:41:20,929 --> 01:41:22,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful, wonderful cat.

1288
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:26,571
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the thing, whenever he gets into a fix, he reaches into his bag of tricks?

1289
01:41:27,497 --> 01:41:28,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.

1290
01:41:28,338 --> 01:41:30,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time since I've seen it.

1291
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:35,367
[SPEAKER_03]: But there will be a standard edition and a classic edition that has the CD soundtrack and a poster and all this good stuff.

1292
01:41:37,904 --> 01:41:43,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, also the Rocket Knight Adventures Resparked Collection is coming as well.

1293
01:41:43,927 --> 01:41:51,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be coming in a standard and classic edition, which I think there's even like a super classic edition or something like that.

1294
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:58,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pre-orders for Felix the Cat start on February 9th and will run for about a month until March 10th.

1295
01:41:58,053 --> 01:42:02,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rocket Knight Adventures opens in just a few days on January 19th and ends on March 3rd.

1296
01:42:03,815 --> 01:42:09,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So some early limited run stuff to kick off the year.

1297
01:42:09,017 --> 01:42:15,639
[SPEAKER_03]: If that is not soon enough for you, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner in some world release dates.

1298
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:16,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1299
01:42:16,379 --> 01:42:20,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't have a lot coming out this week, but there are a few things.

1300
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:25,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting off, we've got Dread Out 2 for Nintendo Switch.

1301
01:42:25,942 --> 01:42:32,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1302
01:42:34,225 --> 01:42:54,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuna and the Haunted Hot Springs, The Thrilling Steamy Maze, Kiwami PC, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 Code Recollection on Nintendo Switch Last but not least, The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PlayStation 5

1303
01:42:59,395 --> 01:43:06,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are coming out over there this week.

1304
01:43:06,318 --> 01:43:13,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the year is really starting to pick up now with releases, because Last of Us Part II Remastered is a pretty big one for some people.

1305
01:43:15,262 --> 01:43:16,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia The Lost Crown

1306
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:32,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles, PlayStation 5

1307
01:43:54,190 --> 01:43:58,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia The Lost Crown Endless Dungeon Last Wish Remastered Ghostrunner 2 Touhou Luna Nights

1308
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:17,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that's next week.

1309
01:44:17,582 --> 01:44:17,982
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1310
01:44:17,982 --> 01:44:19,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That's next week.

1311
01:44:19,223 --> 01:44:24,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess you just have to play Prince of Persia and Last of Us 2 until we get to next week's releases.

1312
01:44:24,787 --> 01:44:28,329
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1313
01:44:28,329 --> 01:44:33,692
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 18th, for the big three consoles, we have Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown.

1314
01:44:33,692 --> 01:44:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 19th, for PlayStation, we have The Last of Us 2 Remastered.

1315
01:44:38,855 --> 01:44:41,877
[SPEAKER_05]: For Switch, we have another code, Recollection.

1316
01:44:41,877 --> 01:44:42,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

1317
01:44:44,506 --> 01:44:46,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it's nice to have release dates again.

1318
01:44:46,927 --> 01:44:49,068
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we have a few more headlines for you.

1319
01:44:49,068 --> 01:44:50,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to open it up for you guys.

1320
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:53,029
[SPEAKER_03]: If you either want to call or ask us questions in chat.

1321
01:44:53,029 --> 01:44:58,471
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have the mailbag, although I sadly think it's another empty week, but we'll look anyway.

1322
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:00,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, a couple stories for you.

1323
01:45:00,292 --> 01:45:01,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with Loki.

1324
01:45:02,763 --> 01:45:09,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because CES is going on this week, so of course we're going to see a lot of weird things out of CES.

1325
01:45:09,207 --> 01:45:15,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those is a project between Sony and Honda called Aphelia.

1326
01:45:15,952 --> 01:45:24,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an electric car that has the option to drive it via a DualSense controller.

1327
01:45:25,549 --> 01:45:27,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not feel safe doing that.

1328
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:35,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Other fun things along with that, though, is they also have an Unreal Engine AR dash.

1329
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:37,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's powered by Unreal.

1330
01:45:37,316 --> 01:45:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They have in the example, like a monster running down the street as you're driving your car.

1331
01:45:41,739 --> 01:45:43,620
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds distracting.

1332
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:46,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also there's a full dash that you can scan.

1333
01:45:46,282 --> 01:45:51,525
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a big wide screen that takes up the entire dash that has

1334
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:58,393
[SPEAKER_02]: like heads up displays for different like games and stuff in there.

1335
01:45:58,393 --> 01:46:02,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, very distracting for drivers as if it wasn't already a problem.

1336
01:46:02,836 --> 01:46:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they're like a fucking YouTube where somebody modded their I don't know their fucking Tesla or something to run off a PlayStation controller for the LOLs and now somebody thought that would make a good idea IRL like Gran Turismo is not real life.

1337
01:46:15,504 --> 01:46:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know it's it's very realistic.

1338
01:46:17,605 --> 01:46:20,667
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's let's remember that racing games are not real life.

1339
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:22,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, yeah, we shouldn't be real life.

1340
01:46:23,048 --> 01:46:33,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of that is, once again, this is probably concept car, and concept cars don't necessarily end up like this, or even come out, for that matter.

1341
01:46:33,952 --> 01:46:37,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like the self-driving cars?

1342
01:46:37,913 --> 01:46:40,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1343
01:46:40,154 --> 01:46:48,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, just because it has, like, controller and support and stuff like that doesn't mean that, like, you'd be able to actually do that.

1344
01:46:48,337 --> 01:46:51,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, doesn't mean it's actually ever going to come out.

1345
01:46:51,858 --> 01:46:52,018
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1346
01:46:53,032 --> 01:46:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if it ever happens.

1347
01:46:55,454 --> 01:47:10,905
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also like I feel like the C and the S in CES often stands for crazy shit because you see a lot of just wild stuff that's never going to come out or it's it's very conceptual or it's the whole like we're doing this because we can.

1348
01:47:10,905 --> 01:47:13,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Like who needs a 200 inch TV?

1349
01:47:13,247 --> 01:47:18,071
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing it because we can, you know, or maybe it's, you know, getting installed at a Dave and Buster somewhere.

1350
01:47:18,071 --> 01:47:19,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really for mass consumption.

1351
01:47:19,792 --> 01:47:20,733
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some pretty cool.

1352
01:47:21,153 --> 01:47:22,734
[SPEAKER_03]: wild shit at CES sometimes.

1353
01:47:22,734 --> 01:47:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some like pretty cool stuff like they had like transparent displays and stuff like that that were really cool looking.

1354
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:30,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, yeah, there is a lot of weird stuff.

1355
01:47:30,077 --> 01:47:39,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you saw like the whole AARP or I don't even know who was a AI company that was doing stuff with AARP or Target or something like that.

1356
01:47:39,122 --> 01:47:49,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had like a virtual Mario that they clearly didn't license and was like showing how an AI avatar can answer questions in like a retail setting or something like that.

1357
01:47:50,507 --> 01:47:55,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, they got their wires crossed and Ben Starr was doing the voice of this Mario.

1358
01:47:55,872 --> 01:47:58,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a me, Mario.

1359
01:47:58,914 --> 01:48:00,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you retiring soon?

1360
01:48:00,836 --> 01:48:03,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want deals at Denny's?

1361
01:48:03,559 --> 01:48:05,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready for the senior menu at Denny's?

1362
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:09,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been better than whatever like voice they ended up with.

1363
01:48:09,464 --> 01:48:12,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's it's like stuff like that.

1364
01:48:12,707 --> 01:48:14,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like, oh, that's just wrong.

1365
01:48:14,348 --> 01:48:16,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But OK, you know, well,

1366
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:20,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do it, I guess, so we're going to show it off.

1367
01:48:20,474 --> 01:48:22,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proof in concept.

1368
01:48:22,196 --> 01:48:27,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more about the concept and what you think it's worth versus what it actually is and the practical uses for it.

1369
01:48:29,179 --> 01:48:30,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, RinClarity is in chat.

1370
01:48:30,699 --> 01:48:31,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1371
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:31,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.

1372
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:32,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see you.

1373
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:37,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and offers this comment saying, um, my opinion on car entertainment devices.

1374
01:48:37,822 --> 01:48:40,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I play music from my smartphone on it?

1375
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:40,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1376
01:48:40,762 --> 01:48:42,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's good enough.

1377
01:48:42,103 --> 01:48:43,503
[SPEAKER_03]: No, exactly that.

1378
01:48:43,503 --> 01:48:53,786
[SPEAKER_03]: All I need, all I need is to be able to blast music from either DDR or the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack as I'm going a godly speed down the I-5.

1379
01:48:53,786 --> 01:48:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's all I need.

1380
01:48:58,504 --> 01:49:00,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah.

1381
01:49:00,085 --> 01:49:00,505
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1382
01:49:00,505 --> 01:49:04,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just hope this PlayStation driving car really goes nowhere.

1383
01:49:04,986 --> 01:49:05,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

1384
01:49:05,647 --> 01:49:11,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty certain that it's not like the only car that you could control with a controller.

1385
01:49:11,229 --> 01:49:20,132
[SPEAKER_02]: But like they had, they've seen a lot of the other ones I've seen have been remote controlled vehicles that children drive through the park with the giant antenna.

1386
01:49:20,132 --> 01:49:23,613
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's what the PlayStation controller cars ought to be.

1387
01:49:24,932 --> 01:49:36,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, well, first off, there's like, it's just, it's a bad idea in a lot of sense, because like, okay, let's say I'm disabling my steering wheel to use my controller to drive my car.

1388
01:49:36,937 --> 01:49:41,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluetooth controllers get disconnected every once in a while for just no reason whatsoever.

1389
01:49:41,919 --> 01:49:45,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not great.

1390
01:49:45,261 --> 01:49:47,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm driving down the freeway.

1391
01:49:47,522 --> 01:49:50,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, can't steer anymore.

1392
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:50,963
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1393
01:49:50,963 --> 01:49:52,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

1394
01:49:52,484 --> 01:49:54,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have one more story for us, right, Loki?

1395
01:49:55,666 --> 01:50:05,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then of course there's a new handheld Sega Genesis system coming out from a Hyperkin, which looks kind of cool.

1396
01:50:05,903 --> 01:50:06,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure.

1397
01:50:06,944 --> 01:50:09,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a extra fat

1398
01:50:10,359 --> 01:50:15,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Gear, which, I mean the Game Gear is already pretty fat as it was.

1399
01:50:15,062 --> 01:50:19,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the Mega Retron HD.

1400
01:50:19,604 --> 01:50:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Retron HD is their popular thing.

1401
01:50:22,025 --> 01:50:26,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now this is going to be called the Mega 95.

1402
01:50:26,167 --> 01:50:33,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And the system is going to, of course, like a Retron, plays a lot of different things.

1403
01:50:34,992 --> 01:50:46,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, they have a USB-C dock that allows you to charge it as well, Mega Drive controller ports, and also out ports to HDMI in case you want to play on your TV.

1404
01:50:46,716 --> 01:50:51,897
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't announced a price or release date for that.

1405
01:50:51,897 --> 01:50:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also...

1406
01:50:55,936 --> 01:50:57,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1407
01:50:57,737 --> 01:51:02,901
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have their previous Retron HD which has Mega Drive support on it already.

1408
01:51:02,901 --> 01:51:05,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So this I guess would be like a portable system for them.

1409
01:51:08,427 --> 01:51:10,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool?

1410
01:51:10,008 --> 01:51:10,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1411
01:51:10,929 --> 01:51:15,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the Hyperkin stuff's been all that super great.

1412
01:51:15,213 --> 01:51:17,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an okay emulation, I guess, of it.

1413
01:51:17,655 --> 01:51:24,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I feel like, obviously, these retro devices are, like, everywhere now at this point.

1414
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:28,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this one actually takes cartridges, though, which is kind of unique, I guess.

1415
01:51:28,844 --> 01:51:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1416
01:51:29,905 --> 01:51:30,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's an emulation.

1417
01:51:31,246 --> 01:51:33,849
[SPEAKER_02]: RingClarity in chat says I had the Hyperkin NES Famicom clone and I didn't like it too much.

1418
01:51:33,849 --> 01:51:35,792
[SPEAKER_03]: The main unit is bulky and the controllers aren't well built.

1419
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:53,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was all of the slotted stories we had for tonight.

1420
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:56,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do want to open it up to our listeners.

1421
01:51:56,314 --> 01:51:59,737
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have anything you'd like to ask us about or have us talk about tonight, we can do that.

1422
01:51:59,737 --> 01:52:06,863
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also call in if you want over at discord vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord and hop in the green room.

1423
01:52:06,863 --> 01:52:13,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as I recognize you as somebody that's participated with the show in some element, we'll bring you I just want to avoid trolls.

1424
01:52:13,809 --> 01:52:18,813
[SPEAKER_03]: We also like to check in with our mailbag participate at orange laundry.com if you want to send us an email.

1425
01:52:19,333 --> 01:52:22,675
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, did we get anything?

1426
01:52:22,675 --> 01:52:25,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly forgot to pull it up.

1427
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:27,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anything was in there.

1428
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I looked a couple of days ago and I haven't seen anything coming since.

1429
01:52:29,818 --> 01:52:32,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'll give it a look.

1430
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:32,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1431
01:52:32,439 --> 01:52:37,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know we missed one a couple of weeks ago, so I hate to miss it again, but I'm pretty sure it was empty.

1432
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:39,622
[SPEAKER_05]: It was empty last week.

1433
01:52:39,622 --> 01:52:40,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1434
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:41,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

1435
01:52:42,837 --> 01:52:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm looking, I'm trying to get it to load up.

1436
01:52:45,739 --> 01:52:50,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, while DarkSakura fires that up, let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

1437
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:52,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I have so many last minute stories.

1438
01:52:52,442 --> 01:52:55,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, it's it's been, yeah, it's like that.

1439
01:52:55,364 --> 01:53:05,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off with the the first announcement that was surprising, yet not surprising, because the numbers from this game have been dwindling ever since the launch week.

1440
01:53:05,709 --> 01:53:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was

1441
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:14,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, Mojang, I can't remember the studio that actually works on this game, but they are... Nothing, by the way.

1442
01:53:14,892 --> 01:53:19,234
[SPEAKER_02]: They are no longer developing Minecraft Legends anymore.

1443
01:53:19,234 --> 01:53:20,814
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically cancelling that game.

1444
01:53:20,814 --> 01:53:21,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That didn't take long.

1445
01:53:21,634 --> 01:53:22,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.

1446
01:53:22,775 --> 01:53:23,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine months.

1447
01:53:23,955 --> 01:53:26,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't even last a whole year.

1448
01:53:26,896 --> 01:53:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've stopped development for that game.

1449
01:53:28,697 --> 01:53:32,638
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be continuing in maintenance mode, and that's it.

1450
01:53:32,638 --> 01:53:34,158
[SPEAKER_02]: No more updates, no nothing.

1451
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:39,320
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of bug fixes or whatever patches they have to do for that.

1452
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.

1453
01:53:41,041 --> 01:53:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have Billy Mitchell settling his lawsuit with, I believe it was Twin Galaxies.

1454
01:53:50,545 --> 01:53:55,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been going on for a while.

1455
01:53:55,447 --> 01:53:57,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Four years, apparently.

1456
01:53:57,868 --> 01:54:01,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there is a lot of evidence against him.

1457
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:02,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean,

1458
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:07,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I just don't fucking care anymore.

1459
01:54:07,038 --> 01:54:12,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can't the world move on beyond Billy Mitchell and his weave?

1460
01:54:12,289 --> 01:54:13,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just yeah, let's move on.

1461
01:54:16,072 --> 01:54:17,573
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you for bringing it up.

1462
01:54:17,573 --> 01:54:18,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not blaming you.

1463
01:54:18,514 --> 01:54:21,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize it's the greater gaming community.

1464
01:54:21,656 --> 01:54:27,179
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube commentators have a huge boner to make 70 minute videos just destroying him.

1465
01:54:27,179 --> 01:54:34,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just like, can't we as society move on from a 60 year old man who wears synthetic hair?

1466
01:54:34,604 --> 01:54:36,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can't we move on from that?

1467
01:54:37,847 --> 01:54:40,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1468
01:54:40,448 --> 01:54:52,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw something that there was originally speculation that GameShark was leaking out a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2.

1469
01:54:52,793 --> 01:54:55,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did hear about this.

1470
01:54:55,234 --> 01:55:01,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Which they said, which they were basically said, oh, no, we were just guessing what the date was going to be.

1471
01:55:01,257 --> 01:55:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the bigger news is GameShark still around?

1472
01:55:05,879 --> 01:55:08,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's still a thing.

1473
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:15,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they have a GameShark AI successor.

1474
01:55:15,285 --> 01:55:24,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what this is, but like, I was just like, wow, that's still a thing.

1475
01:55:24,331 --> 01:55:28,013
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, this thing is just called the GameShark AI because that's the cool term.

1476
01:55:28,013 --> 01:55:29,314
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally has no AI in it.

1477
01:55:30,813 --> 01:55:33,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just guessing, hypothetically.

1478
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:37,150
[SPEAKER_02]: AI stands for we're going all in on buzzwords.

1479
01:55:37,150 --> 01:55:37,511
[SPEAKER_03]: All in.

1480
01:55:40,031 --> 01:55:53,482
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, here's the thing, GameShark, I'm actually willing to believe it was probably just placeholder text, because sometimes placeholder text accidentally gets made live.

1481
01:55:53,482 --> 01:56:06,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually willing to believe it, because what I'm not willing to believe is that Nintendo had a meeting with a company they've never liked to tell them when the successor to the Switch was coming out.

1482
01:56:06,393 --> 01:56:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that would never happen.

1483
01:56:10,615 --> 01:56:13,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be sharing them any information whatsoever.

1484
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:17,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it does get announced for September, then it was a lucky fucking guess.

1485
01:56:17,947 --> 01:56:20,952
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't... a September console release.

1486
01:56:20,952 --> 01:56:23,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what our AI told us.

1487
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:23,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.

1488
01:56:25,971 --> 01:56:26,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1489
01:56:26,371 --> 01:56:32,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still I'm still all about the switch successor coming out like summer like just do it doing a non some non standard shit.

1490
01:56:32,773 --> 01:56:34,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1491
01:56:34,133 --> 01:56:35,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1492
01:56:35,814 --> 01:56:39,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope in the next like month.

1493
01:56:39,815 --> 01:56:43,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to stop like talking about the switch successor and hypotheticals.

1494
01:56:43,356 --> 01:56:44,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting really sick of it.

1495
01:56:44,776 --> 01:56:51,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in the next month, I really hope Nintendo pulls back the curtain on this a little bit but wishful thinking ain't gonna make it true.

1496
01:56:51,558 --> 01:56:54,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1497
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:54,579
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1498
01:56:56,245 --> 01:57:05,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Sia Tabiri in chat says, GameShark made a wish on Game Genie to last forever.

1499
01:57:05,273 --> 01:57:11,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw points out if GameShark is around, maybe they are useful for those retro consoles.

1500
01:57:11,218 --> 01:57:16,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of, I want to say, didn't one of the retrons have like either Game Genie or GameShark?

1501
01:57:16,121 --> 01:57:17,483
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those codes were like built into it.

1502
01:57:17,483 --> 01:57:21,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's basically those codes represented certain hex

1503
01:57:23,747 --> 01:57:24,948
[SPEAKER_02]: values like in memory.

1504
01:57:24,948 --> 01:57:28,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that's just it's a standardized format basically.

1505
01:57:28,271 --> 01:57:36,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you could, in a sense, program in your own cheat codes in there and save it into a library.

1506
01:57:36,078 --> 01:57:49,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like one of my most favorite things to do with MAME is download like the cheats file that you can, you know, basically have GameShark type codes, Game Genie type codes in all these different arcade games.

1507
01:57:49,489 --> 01:57:50,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

1508
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:51,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of fun.

1509
01:57:54,567 --> 01:58:03,013
[SPEAKER_03]: In chat, I'm looking at a comment that came in from Orange Right that said, considering the original Switch came out in March, they don't have to wait until winter or even fall.

1510
01:58:03,013 --> 01:58:06,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, that's absolutely true, but I keep thinking that's way too soon.

1511
01:58:06,655 --> 01:58:15,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually trying to remember, when did they actually announce the original Switch, which released worldwide on March 3rd?

1512
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:20,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to remember, what day did they announce it?

1513
01:58:20,663 --> 01:58:21,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking quickly.

1514
01:58:23,405 --> 01:58:24,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1515
01:58:24,546 --> 01:58:34,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Nintendo revealed technical details of the Switch, including the launch date and price at a press event in Tokyo on January 13th, 2017.

1516
01:58:34,255 --> 01:58:40,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are past that day, but I'm going I'm going back in time.

1517
01:58:40,761 --> 01:58:42,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody get in the time.

1518
01:58:42,863 --> 01:58:43,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in the time machine.

1519
01:58:43,803 --> 01:58:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going shopping.

1520
01:58:46,686 --> 01:58:49,769
[SPEAKER_03]: January 13th was a Friday.

1521
01:58:51,308 --> 01:58:53,675
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was the Friday before Martin Luther King weekend.

1522
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:56,019
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2017.

1523
01:59:27,598 --> 01:59:34,323
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been pretty good about keeping their releases pretty secret for the most part.

1524
01:59:34,323 --> 01:59:40,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know a lot of games far out that are going to be coming anytime soon.

1525
01:59:40,808 --> 01:59:43,510
[SPEAKER_02]: With Nintendo, they don't really announce that stuff right away.

1526
01:59:45,211 --> 01:59:45,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

1527
02:00:09,102 --> 02:00:09,342
[SPEAKER_03]: about

1528
02:00:34,201 --> 02:00:40,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and SSJ100mat says, I think they pushed that new Metroid Prime game for this new thing as the release game.

1529
02:00:40,986 --> 02:00:44,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I'm going to say it's not a release game.

1530
02:00:44,049 --> 02:00:48,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to think it's the holiday game because it doesn't release at the holidays.

1531
02:00:48,392 --> 02:00:52,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's pretty soon, but it's not the release game.

1532
02:00:52,115 --> 02:00:54,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a big part of the release, quite honestly,

1533
02:00:55,538 --> 02:01:00,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to try to move with early adopters just based on the existing Switch library.

1534
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the most attractive things about the Switch successor, they're going to come out and they're going to say, Pokemon Gen 9 runs, runs acceptably on it.

1535
02:01:10,223 --> 02:01:13,244
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't use those words, but that will be the impression.

1536
02:01:13,244 --> 02:01:17,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Gen 9 runs decently on it.

1537
02:01:17,706 --> 02:01:20,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pathetic, if that's the case.

1538
02:01:20,127 --> 02:01:22,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh yeah, we developed it with another system in mind.

1539
02:01:22,588 --> 02:01:22,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like,

1540
02:01:24,298 --> 02:01:25,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they didn't come out until years later.

1541
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:44,215
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a Mario, there will be something, but the real, the real bread and butter game for the Switch 2, the real, Mario Kart 9 will be the real, or if rumors are to be believed, they're doing the Windows thing and going to Mario Kart 10.

1542
02:01:44,215 --> 02:01:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember why that rumor was going around.

1543
02:01:46,237 --> 02:01:48,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something to do with like Mario Kart X or something.

1544
02:01:48,359 --> 02:01:51,762
[SPEAKER_03]: But whatever Mario Kart's future is, that's,

1545
02:01:52,202 --> 02:01:53,423
[SPEAKER_03]: the fucking game.

1546
02:01:53,423 --> 02:02:02,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, technically, if you want to get super technical, technically, it would be the 10th game because you're right, you're right.

1547
02:02:02,707 --> 02:02:04,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, World Circuit was nine.

1548
02:02:04,108 --> 02:02:05,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1549
02:02:05,448 --> 02:02:12,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So which is stupid, though, but like, yeah, well, yeah, which pretty much that whole game's just been ported his tracks into eight deluxe, which whatever fine.

1550
02:02:14,929 --> 02:02:17,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a new Mario Kart game would be cool.

1551
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:29,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see them necessarily doing the same game plan as the Switch one, because that's what they did with Switch, is they ported 8 from the Wii U and had that.

1552
02:02:29,938 --> 02:02:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see them

1553
02:02:32,129 --> 02:02:32,930
[SPEAKER_02]: there.

1554
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:35,052
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is not even a prediction.

1555
02:02:35,052 --> 02:02:47,282
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like, like, I would go so far as to root this in fact, there will be a Mario Kart successor game on the Switch successor sooner rather than later, because that is the fucking money printer.

1556
02:02:47,282 --> 02:02:47,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, look,

1557
02:02:48,763 --> 02:02:52,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart 8 is still a top seller to this day.

1558
02:02:52,806 --> 02:03:02,614
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be fools not to release a Mario Kart 10 or even if nothing else, they're going to they're going to rehash Mario Kart 8 one more time.

1559
02:03:02,614 --> 02:03:03,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch.

1560
02:03:03,394 --> 02:03:07,417
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to put out and it'll be a launch title for the Switch to Switch successor.

1561
02:03:07,417 --> 02:03:17,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be Mario Kart 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, everything, the whole fucking pack with everything they've released, all the DLCs, everything in one cartridge.

1562
02:03:18,001 --> 02:03:23,064
[SPEAKER_03]: and that'll be the swan song for 8 to hold us over for about a year until Mario Kart 10 actually happens.

1563
02:03:23,064 --> 02:03:31,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be another, what their launch game will be, the big launch title is gonna be another Wii remaster game.

1564
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:36,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be Super Mario Galaxy HD, something like that.

1565
02:03:37,561 --> 02:03:41,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to, I think an Odyssey sequel makes so much sense.

1566
02:03:41,424 --> 02:03:43,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope I would love to see an Odyssey.

1567
02:03:43,726 --> 02:03:45,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's what it is.

1568
02:03:45,008 --> 02:03:51,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see a Mario Odyssey sequel as the launch game that that should have had trust.

1569
02:03:51,554 --> 02:03:54,496
[SPEAKER_05]: It should have had trust in it as a mini game.

1570
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:54,997
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.

1571
02:03:56,778 --> 02:03:59,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did want to mention as a random aside thing.

1572
02:03:59,641 --> 02:04:03,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if I mentioned it when we were talking about why I have Clockwork Knight in the background.

1573
02:04:03,664 --> 02:04:11,771
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cheat code that was unveiled that apparently the first Clockwork Knight game was hiding in the second Clockwork Knight game.

1574
02:04:11,771 --> 02:04:13,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can play the full game, huh?

1575
02:04:14,844 --> 02:04:17,706
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with all these old-ass cheat codes coming to light?

1576
02:04:17,706 --> 02:04:22,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we had the one about the alien PlayStation game that just, like, fucking unlocks your hardware.

1577
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:26,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlocks the fucking hardware to play anything.

1578
02:04:26,313 --> 02:04:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just coming to light 20-plus years later.

1579
02:04:29,095 --> 02:04:30,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

1580
02:04:30,316 --> 02:04:30,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

1581
02:04:32,521 --> 02:04:33,322
[SPEAKER_03]: DJRamaS

1582
02:04:53,988 --> 02:05:01,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the best that they've done recently with Luigi, aside from Luigi's Mansion games, is the new Luigi U. He had his game for a while.

1583
02:05:01,538 --> 02:05:05,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or, well, I mean, he's also in that, you know, Super Mario Wonder.

1584
02:05:05,424 --> 02:05:08,568
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still Mario's brother in that game, so.

1585
02:05:09,736 --> 02:05:11,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, all right.

1586
02:05:11,358 --> 02:05:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with that, we're going to go around and wrap up for tonight.

1587
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:16,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so much for being here and participating with our show tonight.

1591
02:05:26,471 --> 02:05:28,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell a friend or two.

1593
02:05:59,014 --> 02:06:05,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my final thought is fact check before you repost.

1594
02:06:05,636 --> 02:06:07,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, I will do my best.

1595
02:06:07,516 --> 02:06:08,616
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1596
02:06:08,616 --> 02:06:09,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you, DarkSakura.

1597
02:06:09,696 --> 02:06:10,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good stream.

1598
02:06:10,197 --> 02:06:11,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in a minute.

1599
02:06:11,737 --> 02:06:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1600
02:06:12,477 --> 02:06:14,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll go to you with your final thought.

1601
02:06:14,698 --> 02:06:16,238
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your final thought tonight?

1602
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:17,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get to some editing.

1603
02:06:17,498 --> 02:06:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I've realized I've been, I haven't released a video in like 24 days.

1604
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:24,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been a hot minute.

1605
02:06:25,262 --> 02:06:29,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've just been putting off editing, I think.

1606
02:06:29,465 --> 02:06:31,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have lots of big projects.

1607
02:06:31,526 --> 02:06:33,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I've got pretty much this next video.

1608
02:06:33,667 --> 02:06:34,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost ready to go.

1609
02:06:34,828 --> 02:06:36,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already mostly edited.

1610
02:06:36,649 --> 02:06:41,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to put in the last, like, 30 minutes into it.

1611
02:06:41,612 --> 02:06:42,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll do that.

1612
02:06:42,493 --> 02:06:46,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a big build coming on the Fever Dream SMP.

1613
02:06:46,055 --> 02:06:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all the materials are pretty much gathered on that.

1614
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:51,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, that's gonna be coming.

1615
02:06:51,158 --> 02:06:51,459
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll...

1616
02:06:52,379 --> 02:07:04,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it'll be a different type of video because it's satirizing, um, the younger generation, like type of editing where it's just like, Hey guys, what's up?

1617
02:07:04,403 --> 02:07:05,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your boy.

1618
02:07:05,044 --> 02:07:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that type of annoying stuff.

1619
02:07:07,565 --> 02:07:12,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the whole thing's supposed to take place in a nightmare for my character or me or whatever.

1620
02:07:12,706 --> 02:07:15,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like... Watch it be your most viewed video.

1621
02:07:15,487 --> 02:07:16,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's...

1622
02:07:18,217 --> 02:07:20,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It does feature a very popular meme.

1623
02:07:20,659 --> 02:07:29,063
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, actually, the build theme on this SMP is memes.

1624
02:07:29,063 --> 02:07:45,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has... I have a 75,000 block build I'm doing, and then another smaller 25,000 block build I'm doing, both regarding giant memes, and then I'm supposed to have other stuff I build around it, but that's what's planned so far.

1625
02:07:45,913 --> 02:07:46,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1626
02:07:48,735 --> 02:07:50,175
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1627
02:07:50,175 --> 02:07:53,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see my final thought tonight.

1628
02:07:53,156 --> 02:08:00,459
[SPEAKER_03]: My new favorite thing to do on Facebook is when I get those fucking clickbait headlines that are that are that are advertisements.

1629
02:08:00,459 --> 02:08:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I will I will buy I will fall for it and click the article and then I will post a summary in two sentences and do say hashtag save you a click and I can't tell you how many likes I've gotten on posts from local newspaper and stuff from just saying saved you a click.

1630
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:23,699
[SPEAKER_03]: about things that I'm getting advertised that don't even happen in this town that are in the local newspaper.

1631
02:08:23,699 --> 02:08:27,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm declaring war on clickbait headlines this year.

1632
02:08:28,356 --> 02:08:30,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Click here to find out why.

1633
02:08:30,177 --> 02:08:31,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1634
02:08:31,337 --> 02:08:32,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week.

1635
02:08:32,198 --> 02:08:34,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this all again in seven more days.

1636
02:08:34,098 --> 02:08:34,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1637
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:35,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy gaming.

1638
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:36,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1639
02:08:36,939 --> 02:08:38,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1640
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:39,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night, everybody.

1641
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't forget about Awesome Game Stunt Quick.

1642
02:08:41,361 --> 02:08:45,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, later tonight, Bobby Blackwolf is hosting and also later this week.

1643
02:08:45,303 --> 02:08:46,723
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?
