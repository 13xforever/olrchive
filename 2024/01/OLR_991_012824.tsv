9733	13636	InTheGroove rips off Dance Dance Revolution, adds 3D and zany mods, makes a splash.
13636	16739	Genshin Impact rips off Zelda, adds gacha, becomes a huge hit.
16739	20382	Power World rips off Pokemon, adds guns, becomes the next lightning in a bottle.
20382	26667	Derivative Works and merging two hit formulas together to make a new one is not an uncommon act, but makes for a legal headache and an unending gamer debate.
26667	28309	I'm still avoiding talking about layoffs.
28309	35115	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to talk about these and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39229	66877	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight January the 28th 2024 for the 991st time that's right episode 991 of our program live since 2002 uh if you can believe it or not talking about video games the gaming industry the gamer lifestyle gaming culture
68137	71679	Uh, even when sometimes the news isn't so good, which I feel like it is this week.
71679	78461	I was just saying earlier, it's it's hard to be a gaming enthusiast show when you're not always feeling enthusiastic about the industry.
78461	85323	And I think those of you that follow the news even very lightly probably have a very good idea what I'm referencing.
85323	86544	We'll get to that in a moment.
86544	90185	But first, I'm always enthusiastic to say hello to my co-host.
90185	91686	I'm kind of welcoming back last week.
91686	94967	Well, DarkSakura was here for part of the show, but hi DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
98325	101288	Hi, and I hope you're feeling better this week.
101288	102509	I'm feeling much better.
102509	112920	You know, the my ability to actually eat food returned a few days ago, and I made myself a delightful lamb dish from scratch.
116817	127254	Bojolet, my favorite red wine, cranberries, multicolored baby carrots, herbs from my
128856	143207	and I'm pretty sure I saw I'm pretty sure I saw a blue sky post at some point over the weekend where you were you were kind of you were you were wine drinking and you were saying I gotta like I don't know it was something like I got a wine buzz going or something something that I forgot the exact verbage.
143207	148611	So Dan, Dan was asking if I was going to be if I was streaming.
148611	150853	I'm like, no, I'm streaming at 830 right now.
150853	151273	It's drunk 30.
151273	152334	That's it.
152334	153455	That's it.
153455	154376	It's drunk 30.
154376	155677	That's it.
155677	155977	Drunk 30.
155977	156537	Right.
156537	156597	And
158786	162550	And it you know, the wine was good and I have zero regrets.
162550	163071	Oh, yes.
163071	166675	As long as you're drinking responsibly, you shouldn't have any regrets.
166675	167937	And I know you do.
167937	171140	No red wine headaches when it's a good red wine.
171140	172622	I am.
172622	173263	All right.
173263	174484	Well, also say hello.
174484	177227	I'm enthusiastic to welcome back this week.
177227	179049	Loki, how are you doing, Loki?
179049	179470	I'm doing good.
179887	182608	All right, you were off last week because the kiddo's birthday.
182608	184429	DJ Ranma S was here.
184429	191512	Not that you could ever be replaced, but Ranma did a great job in your absence, especially when he ended up having to do a two chair show with me for half the show.
191512	194053	So big thanks to our pal Ranma for being here last week.
194053	197234	But it's fantastic to have you back.
197234	199375	And how was the kiddo's birthday?
199375	199915	Did you?
199915	205638	I know sometimes you do like golf land or like some of these things that we used to do in the past.
205638	206018	Yeah.
206878	210603	He didn't really want to do anything like that.
210603	218313	We offered to do a birthday party with his friends and stuff, but he just wanted to go eat at the Olive Garden and then...
220017	223258	We also hung out with... A man with taste!
223258	225279	A little young man with taste!
225279	227960	He likes the breadsticks, you know what I'm gonna say.
227960	229040	Who fucking doesn't?
229040	237023	I mean, you know, it's... So we did that, and yeah, I mean, he got his usual gifts that he asked for.
238795	239856	It's kind of interesting.
239856	245440	So yeah, he does all the Robux stuff, so usually gets a lot of Robux.
245440	254786	I think he got some Steam cards and my wife got him some fidget, like, stress balls is what he wanted.
254786	256328	So he has like 30 of those now.
258376	259217	Wow.
259217	260537	Is this your younger?
260537	264080	I need one the size of my cubicle, please.
264080	267822	I actually, actually legit, I love those little stress pop things.
267822	269443	But funny enough, I don't have one.
269443	271344	But I'll be sitting there in a Target.
271344	278409	And like, I don't know about you all, but like I have this really weird ritual when we go to Target is that we always go look at the video game section.
278909	306813	even when we're like we're not gonna buy anything and like I know I have this fucking podcast I know what games are coming out well we still we always go look Alan and I have to look we walk up and down the aisles but lately it's well number one those aisles have been getting smaller and smaller which is kind of depressing yeah they um they've like it's weird they like at first I thought they removed all of their video games but they just removed the cover art for their video games and they have it like still locked up but there's like hardly any
307481	312286	physical media there right now.
312286	319093	They have it there, but you have to really peer in the case to see what's actually there.
319093	321096	It's kind of weird.
321096	328804	I'm not sure what that's all about, if it's just that they're not giving them good margins anymore, and so it's like, well, we're just not going to carry this.
329444	343554	But the reason I brought it up is that last time we were there, we floated to the video game section and then like across from that or behind it, they have like the pop culture stuff, like all the pop vinyls and that, you know, the horror dolls and all that stuff.
343554	345615	But they had a little pop thing.
345615	348537	And I just started sitting there going pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
348537	351179	And like, literally, I'm in my own little world.
351179	353401	And then Alan is like, where did you go?
353401	356423	Like, I started walking down the aisles looking.
356423	357984	I'm going to get you one the size of your head.
358924	359565	Yes, please.
359565	360205	I'd love it.
360205	365109	I still need to give you your presents, too, because I actually found something else to add to it and now I have to find where I put it.
365109	365990	Oh, nice.
365990	367211	Love it.
367211	374016	Actually, speaking of Target, the other reason to look at Target is they do have random ass video game knickknacks sometimes.
374016	378259	I'm sure this is true of any department store, but like the baby arcade one-up Ms.
378259	381001	Pac-Man that sits behind me on the stream where we tape live.
381341	400970	as we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show and you can see things behind me like my little baby arcade one-up miss pac-man machine oops sorry that I got from Tarjay uh so they get random ass knickknacks sometimes that are pretty cool believe it or not so
401730	414164	Anyway, so Loki, you weren't here last week, but I see I see this whole pal world stuff has obviously made its way to your house with because I can see it in the background there.
414164	420110	I have you gotten on the power world bandwagon or you know, I haven't played it yet.
420110	420531	It's um,
421215	423296	It's something we'll talk about later.
423296	432383	It's, it's interesting how huge that game keeps getting and how huge the target is getting as a result.
432383	434584	Speaking of targets, but in a different way.
434584	436986	So we'll talk, we'll talk all about that a little bit.
437466	441311	But first, we're going to start off tonight with some news that isn't fun.
441311	453565	This is this is the this is the crappiest part of talking about the news every week because this is a story that won't go away and it's getting really, really
455925	456785	Hard.
456785	459766	Like it's it's been hard every time, but it's like it's it's right.
459766	461067	It's not stopping.
461067	462287	It's getting worse.
462287	463808	I don't think it's unexpected, though.
463808	480074	Like, honestly, I mean, because so the story we have, of course, is Activision Blizzard have or Microsoft with their purchase of Activision Blizzard have laid off nearly 2000 jobs across, you know, Activision Blizzard.
481035	482857	Zenimax, Xbox
493976	500424	a lot of different departments like your HR, your legal, you know, could be marketing teams, who knows.
500424	501765	But there's a lot of that stuff.
501765	509154	They said that represents roughly 8.6% of the gaming workforce, they said.
512553	521419	And it, you know, obviously, you know, they said it's a painful decision, but, you know, they're providing them support during their transition and stuff like that.
521419	528744	I just think that's something, though, we see, though, with these acquisitions that there are going to, they're never going to keep everybody.
528744	531026	It's, there are going to be layoffs.
531026	540012	It does suck when we're talking about like large companies like this, where those small percentages, I mean, 8.6 is still not a small percentage, but, um,
541227	541367	It's
561508	565649	The hardworking, you know, entry level QA customer service.
565649	568210	We're talking VPs were involved with this as well.
568210	577093	So there is that because sometimes it feels like the highest end is not getting affected the same way, you know, and so forth.
577093	580994	Not that that makes this news any easier to report on.
580994	585556	And yeah, I mean, and certainly some folks have made some very pointed things about
585876	591799	Well, those of you that were rooting for the Activision Blizzard Microsoft merger to happen must be feeling some sort of way about this.
591799	594821	And I kind of like the number one girl, fuck you sit down.
594821	597863	Like I don't I don't like don't come at me with that attitude.
597863	599704	I don't wish for this type of thing.
599704	604026	Like what Loki is saying with the redundancies and stuff.
604026	606948	Yes, that is a very unfortunate sort of side effect to this.
606948	611451	But again, to get rid of the toxicity of Bobby Kotick,
612443	623166	It's one of those things where I don't, I fear it would have been worse had his stake been allowed to stay on the industry.
623166	623806	Yes.
623806	625887	But I want to kind of have this.
625887	627948	Yeah, I was gonna say I want a feeling.
627948	628888	Oh, go ahead.
628888	629408	Good.
629408	633790	Well, it feels to me like cutting out of cancer and taking some healthy tissue with it.
633790	635210	Um, but
636852	647985	I do feel bad for the people who are affected by this, but I hope that most of those executives that went as well were his cronies.
648717	649797	Hmm.
649797	659319	But now DarkSakura, you have an interesting follow up here too, because we're not actually just that because this actually does go deeper than redundancies, which I think is important to point out.
659319	669962	And I noticed in our chat, of course, folks are talking about this over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, as you and her Matt says redundancy, but also it hit a lot of studios, projects, teams.
669962	671902	Yes, DarkSakura, you have an example of this, right?
673584	682068	Yeah, there was a team that was working on an unannounced survival game.
682068	687771	They had been developing it over the last six years before the pandemic occurred.
687771	699136	It was announced in 2022 without a name, no trailer, but it would have been their first new IP since Overwatch, which launched in May of 2016.
700817	702739	I had some beautiful concept art to it.
702739	713948	It looks sort of like a like one scene on here looks like people are in the real world and they're riding a bike on a nature trail and suddenly they find a portal to this magic world.
713948	715729	And then you're in the magic world.
715729	718992	So, I mean, that would look cool.
718992	721514	But I mean, it's
723135	733811	It's still, um, you know, I think of how I would feel if I had spent six months, six years of my life working on something and then go, huh, nope.
733811	738859	So, I mean, it's not, it's not unexpected, but at the same time, you know,
740935	741415	I don't know.
741415	754342	I don't know if they might even do something with those assets or if it's just gone or I mean, a lot of times that we will find games that were cancelled and then converted into another project.
754342	763006	So yes, which you're literally speaking of Overwatch was once upon a time Project Titan, which was supposed to be some type of MMO successor.
763006	766348	But it it kind of touched a lot of different things.
766348	768009	And I'm really being
768829	776195	Generous with cutting corners here, but I'm just going to say like, essentially, the PvP element of that MMO ended up being Overwatch.
776195	784481	And some of the classes were kind of reformed as personalities, like Tracer, I think was originally just like a dasher or something like a class.
784481	785902	And so they, you know, they reformed that.
785902	790045	But essentially, long story short, Titan evolved into Overwatch.
791549	792769	or Dems Fightin' Herds.
812535	815677	size when that axe fell on that project.
815677	819280	I feel like those folks were, you know, some went to Hearthstone, some went to WoW.
819280	821441	So, you know, they were kind of spread out a little bit.
821441	822201	I could be wrong.
822201	826124	Again, this is something, I mean, Overwatch didn't come out to 2016, as Jamie said.
826124	828546	So Titan was canceled like 2013, 2014, somewhere there.
828546	830667	It's been a long time.
830667	836631	So my memory is not great, but you know, I, I, I worry if this one's ever going to see the light of day.
836631	839293	And what's weird to me, I mean,
840339	841700	Why?
841700	854975	Because Blizzard is really good at taking the must-have genre of the moment and making it a very easy pill to swallow for a mass audience.
855515	858598	That's what they did with EverQuest and World of Warcraft.
858598	861721	That's what they did with Team Fortress and Overwatch 2.
861721	867246	That's what they did with Dota 2 and League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm.
867246	868267	That's what they did.
868267	869648	I mean, the list goes on and on.
869648	880439	Just about all of their games have been really hot genres that have been extremely accessible to people that otherwise are probably not fans of that genre.
881815	885357	So it is wild to me.
885357	892440	And I understand, I don't know all the inner workings of this project or Blizzard, and there's just some fucking questions I'm not going to get to know the answer to.
892440	898362	And we're just like, it's just like, whose lipstick did BB have in that episode of All Stars 3?
898362	899583	She's never going to tell.
899583	903105	Some questions are never going to be answered, and this is one of them.
903105	910648	And it's rough, but it's so wild to me that a survival game gets canceled the same week
912128	920606	that a survival game is the literal lightning rod of the entire fucking industry and shattering the records that we see.
921938	922799	We had this game.
922799	928823	It was like Pokemon with guns, but someone beat us to it.
928823	930404	And it's very clear from the concept art.
930404	931905	It was nothing like that, to be clear.
931905	936368	But it is still wild to me.
936368	943552	Now, and I know I know that obviously a decision like this was weeks in the and nobody could have called the power world.
943552	944073	I get it.
944073	944753	I get all that.
944753	946294	You don't have to correct me on that.
946294	948135	But the optics are still
949396	953479	so wild to me that that game gets canceled.
953479	958482	But I'm hearing that there might have been difficulties with an internal engine that they were writing for that.
958482	973313	I wonder if we're going to find out quite a bit about this game because unlike with Titan, I think you're going to have some bitter Bettys and bitter Bills and bitter B names here that are going bitter Bobs that are going to want to talk about
974835	977437	what happened and what it was all about.
977437	985763	So stay tuned, I guess we could see some interesting stuff in the next week about what this game was all about and why they maybe pulled it.
985763	987784	So I thought it was engine issues.
987784	989606	That's what I was seeing in the blogs.
990046	1018827	yeah but it's also hard because like that's that is one take that's being amplified and it's like the one thing we have right now so maybe but there's probably a lot of other stories too um let's see uh other comments in chat uh let's see um sorry somebody had said ah E3VL said Microsoft probably saw the game and thought it was similar to Redfall and didn't want to make the same mistake hmm
1019725	1033106	I'm probably not I wouldn't say that but it could be I don't know it could be something that they've spent like X number amount of time working on production and they're not far enough into
1034949	1038430	development to sink more money into it, I guess.
1038430	1061796	Like, it sounds like they were saying they were prototyping Unreal, they were trying to switch to Synapse, but, you know, they had a lot of time already invested into it, and perhaps, you know, not wanting to make another Duke Nukem Forever, if you will, like, you know, maybe it's just like, nah, we're just gonna cut our losses on this and go to the next thing.
1063929	1070436	Kaji Shuto Art in chat says, I said this earlier, but it brings up how much it hurts the people working on these.
1070436	1072118	That's six years of your life.
1072118	1078205	Will they maybe in the future be able to go to another company for them to pick it up so all that work isn't fully lost?
1078205	1080888	Unfortunately, probably not.
1081408	1087733	Like the closest that could happen is that they could go to another company and use that expertise to work on a similar game.
1087733	1094238	But as far as like the art that they did, the programming they did, the code that they did, that all belongs to Microsoft now.
1094238	1103926	Um, and you know, for, for potentially something else to come of it, you know, I'm, I'm assuming it won't, but who knows, we could get an Overwatch style thing that comes out of this.
1103926	1105067	I just, I just don't know.
1105067	1106708	It's hard to say at this point.
1106708	1107248	However,
1108169	1116951	And this is just one of those type of things I was thinking about because I have said on the show and there's been some very pointed comments on this stuff on social media.
1116951	1117771	I want to be very clear.
1117771	1134175	I have said on the show that oftentimes from these fires of these layoffs comes the phoenix that rises from the ashes, the indie games and the indie studios and, you know, people that are put out that go on to create their own thing and find success on their own terms.
1134815	1139558	But when I've said that, I have always said, those that have the means to do so.
1139558	1141178	Not everybody has the means to do so.
1141178	1148982	And there's a very, you know, there's a very pointed tweet from somebody affected out there right now that says something to the effect of you can't just go and start up your own indie studio.
1148982	1149583	It's not that easy.
1149583	1150523	Yeah, yeah, I get all that.
1150523	1151504	And that's not what I'm saying.
1151504	1159128	I'm just saying that, you know, hopefully for those that can do that, there are still some flowers to grow from this whole situation.
1159128	1162790	Interestingly enough, I don't know how many of y'all remember,
1163786	1176828	But do you remember that there were some executives, Jen O'Neill and Jay Allen Brack, who were both formerly with Blizzard, they formed their own studio with a third person.
1176828	1178869	I'm sorry, I forget what the third person was.
1178869	1181209	Not that long ago.
1181209	1185510	So to kind of the full circle answer to the question, I don't know what this studio is working on.
1185510	1189251	I don't know if they're doing an MMO, an action game, what, it could be anything, right?
1189251	1190811	If they're working on a survival game,
1191803	1200128	These would be prime candidates to pick up and place on a game like that if that new company has the means to do so, which it might not.
1200128	1206652	I mean, without a product yet, they only have investors and may not have all of that type of income and that sort of thing.
1208553	1216721	That's, that's where you sort of hope to see it happen is ironically a lot of these executives that have gone to form their own studio.
1216721	1220945	Same thing happened with Chris Smetsim, but then he ended up coming back to Blizzard.
1220945	1225329	But I don't know whatever happened to that studio that he formed and the thing that he was working on at some point.
1225329	1226430	So there was that.
1226430	1228992	Thank you, DJ Ranma S. It was Frost Giant Studios.
1228992	1231435	Yes.
1231435	1231835	Let's see.
1233296	1243880	Bobby Blackwolf says, there's an indie dev I've been talking to here who has been working on his game for seven years and I asked him, at what point do you give up on it and move on to something more feasible?
1243880	1254823	Well, I mean, it's a sunk cost fallacy at that point, you know, it's basically, you've invested so much time into it now, you can't quit because you've invested all that time into it.
1254823	1256284	Like, I understand that.
1256284	1258525	It also depends on how far along you are.
1258525	1261446	Like, I spent years trying to
1262606	1271254	Get a general understanding of like Unity and making games, which by the way, great, great segue real quick.
1271254	1281483	My oldest son, who's been doing programming for God years now, finally hit the belt because they have like different belt levels in the coding
1282898	1283318	Lua, LuaJS
1312486	1319035	What was it, just the regular scripting blocks type language at one point?
1319035	1325543	They need to get him on Python, because that's where a lot of it is right now.
1325543	1326584	Yeah, I don't know.
1326584	1329769	Unity, I'm kind of like, well... Python's easy.
1331383	1333104	Yeah, Python's not hard either.
1333104	1335125	Um, yeah, I don't know.
1335125	1337306	As a teenager, let him do what he wants.
1337306	1341428	That's fun to him because that's exciting that he's even sticking with it at all.
1341428	1342009	Exactly.
1342009	1345150	And in a lot of that, like, he'll figure some of this other stuff out himself.
1345150	1345791	Yeah.
1345791	1348873	With other languages, like it's all syntax for a lot of it anyway.
1348873	1354936	So once you understand the fundamentals and you've done it enough times in different languages, you just start recognizing.
1354936	1357697	It's easier to learn another language once you have a couple.
1357697	1360699	I just said teenager because he's turning 13 this year, isn't he?
1361249	1362030	He's already 13.
1362030	1367399	He's turning 14 this year.
1367399	1368520	Where does time go?
1368520	1370223	The youngest just turned 10.
1370223	1373508	So, you know, Julian's what, 16 now?
1375851	1377212	I have to ask.
1377212	1377692	I know.
1377692	1379233	I think Julian's older than that.
1379233	1380113	I hate to say it.
1380113	1382375	By the way, Julian was on this show.
1382375	1384115	I forgot how old your child is.
1384115	1387958	Julian was on this show pre-pandemic as like a 12-year-old playing.
1387958	1388278	What was it?
1388278	1391079	Was he playing Minecraft or one of those puzzle games or something?
1391079	1391660	I don't know.
1391660	1392840	But he was giving his review on it.
1392840	1394121	Pirate 101.
1394121	1399104	And so like it's wild to me to think that like Julian's like fucking an adult now, pretty much.
1399104	1400644	He was playing Pirate 101.
1400644	1401245	That's what it was.
1401245	1401825	Pirate 101.
1401825	1403426	Oh, my God.
1405154	1406496	We need to get him back on this show.
1406496	1411482	It's like, so it's probably like, you know, with your it's probably that point.
1411482	1413845	It's like having facial hair now, Julian.
1413845	1418411	Probably that point in his life where he's embarrassed to talk to 40 year olds on their show.
1420513	1421434	Yeah, a little bit.
1421434	1427638	Like, I don't know, like, some of my son's friends watch my YouTube channel.
1427638	1430440	But that's because they're into, some of them are into Minecraft.
1430440	1438465	In fact, actually, he got back into Minecraft with his friends because one of his friend actually is a mod developer for Minecraft.
1438465	1444489	So he, he is, his kind of claim to fame is making a really involved
1444989	1454817	Witherstorm mod, which is from like, it's a monster boss, like monster thing from Minecraft.
1454817	1458539	It was the Telltale one, Minecraft story mode.
1458539	1461262	So they now bring that into actual Minecraft.
1461262	1466906	It's like a multi-phase boss and stuff, and it's like really huge, but he helped code all that stuff.
1466906	1473691	So they've been like playing that quite a bit and just playing survival multiplayer, which I'm like, yes, you're back into it now.
1473691	1473791	Woo.
1475219	1477540	Wow, wow, wow, wow.
1477540	1478080	All right.
1478080	1479460	Well, anyhow, we're getting off track.
1479460	1480281	What else is new?
1480281	1489364	But I did, you know, just want to say that really is unfortunate for Microsoft and Blizzard and the folks there.
1489364	1492165	I should point out, I don't know if you want to kind of get the rest of this Loki.
1492165	1495526	It wasn't just Blizzard affected this week either.
1495526	1495946	Right.
1495946	1500688	It was also, you know, the Call of Duty companies, because there are so many of them.
1502248	1513431	But yeah, basically that, you know, Sledgehammer Games, Raven Software, Infinity Ward, all impacted by these layoffs as well.
1513431	1515452	Treyarch, Haimutsu.
1515452	1519953	God, there's so many studios working on Call of Duty.
1519953	1524474	Maybe they're just cutting down on the number of studios they have working on Call of Duty, because that's a lot.
1524474	1527855	But yeah, it's across the board.
1527855	1530436	I think we kind of established that in the beginning, that it's not just...
1532830	1535292	these new companies, it's also Microsoft themselves.
1535292	1540156	It's it's across the board, just a reduction of staff, because I think it's redundancy.
1540156	1545760	Certainly some of it could be just, you know, the path of numbers for your financial year, whatever the case may be.
1545760	1557029	But I'm thinking with a large acquisition like this, with two large companies coming together, it's got to be redundancies for a lot of it for right now until.
1557029	1562093	Later on the year, and we'll see how performance goes and then more layoffs, I'm sure.
1562898	1566859	Well, even this week, it wasn't just Microsoft either.
1566859	1571560	Because by the time this news came out, I feel like almost everybody's already forgotten.
1571560	1577821	Just earlier this week, there was another big gaming company layoff that had happened as well, that we need to acknowledge.
1577821	1581541	Riot Games laid off 11% of their workforce.
1581541	1586922	So 530 employees were laid off as well.
1586922	1589883	And yeah, basically that they're
1590987	1598010	trying to help them transition to their new jobs, but yeah, it's still, it's across the industry.
1598010	1609255	And I think it was even said that already we are, but like not even a full month into the year and we're almost approaching half of the layoff numbers of 2023.
1609255	1609775	So it's not great.
1614505	1616726	It's hard to kind of go like, well, what happened?
1616726	1622287	And I guess a lot of people are kind of pointing at like COVID and how this industry really exploded.
1622287	1630730	Years so outside of COVID, like, I mean, it's been years now, like, I'm sorry, like, I'm starting to less believe the COVID thing.
1630730	1634811	It's more of like, I don't know what it would really be.
1634811	1638192	I think maybe it could possibly be COVID in the sense that
1639602	1644945	There were a lot more people playing games and engaging with online games and stuff like that.
1644945	1649768	And maybe profits were a bit higher because of that stay-at-home order type thing.
1649768	1652610	And now the things have- Games as a service were more attractive when they were stay-at-home.
1652610	1653230	Exactly.
1653230	1661416	So, and now, now that people are both not just staying at home, they're going out and doing things, but on top of that, you know, the,
1662873	1681668	Economy as a whole is kind of on the downturn and so people are being a little bit more conservative with the money that they're spending on these services and as such they are not hitting their impossibly optimistic goals of making a profit every year and a great enough profit for their shareholders
1682248	1685973	And so it's maybe that's how it's coming into play.
1685973	1690539	But I certainly wouldn't believe that it's like, oh, well, man, COVID put us behind schedule.
1690539	1692342	OK, well, that was years ago at this point.
1692342	1693463	Like, come on.
1693463	1695406	It can't be like impacted.
1697393	1701956	5 years out from covid or whatever, you know, however long this is going to last.
1701956	1705519	And I just don't see that as realistic.
1705519	1715086	I could believe, though, the not hitting expectations because those expectations were skewed based off of the, you know, stay at home orders that were going around.
1715086	1717748	I would pin it more on the second half of what you're saying there.
1719208	1721189	SJ100 Matt in chat over twitch.tv.
1721189	1725350	VOG Network says it was sad to see that Blizz customer service was gutted.
1725350	1729012	Every every dealing I've had with their customer service has been a plus.
1729012	1732233	And apparently those positions are being outsourced elsewhere, which is a shame.
1732233	1736114	Yeah, it's probably going to fall in line with Microsoft's customer service, which I don't know.
1736114	1739715	I haven't had to deal with them a lot, but I think it's pretty well known fact.
1739715	1742996	A lot of that is offshored to save on money.
1742996	1744897	And I'm just when it comes to customer service,
1745757	1749179	You and this is somebody who worked in customer service for a very long time.
1749179	1749939	I don't anymore.
1749939	1754761	So I feel like I can just kind of say this very openly when it comes to things like that.
1754761	1756442	You get what you pay for.
1757692	1784754	and I think with World of Warcraft and the fact that that game really needs its fans more than ever like the people that have really held on to World of Warcraft all this time throughout the controversy and throughout everything else I mean granted Dragonflight overall was a better expansion and kind of where the game was at coming into it but I just feel like like if a lot of people get poor customer service in World of Warcraft with the quality of
1785334	1789416	the game and the social community and all that goes downhill.
1789416	1793538	Like, this is the decision you're going to have to blame for that.
1793538	1798981	And I I'm not sure this is the smartest business decision.
1798981	1803403	And granted, I don't know how this directly impacts like the GM system, or World of Warcraft.
1803403	1813588	So maybe I'm making it up in my head, which I'm fully willing to admit, but you got to be really careful outsourcing customer service jobs, because you're going to get exactly what you pay for.
1815041	1824108	And you're trying to sell this 10-year commitment to WoW with this new storyline and the next three expansions and all this stuff?
1824108	1827470	That's a slippery slope, folks.
1827470	1833074	I hope there was a little more information going into this decision than it sure seems like it.
1835066	1846677	Yeah, and sjo100map just points out the parts that are cruel, saying they drag these employees back to the office from remote, many of them having to move across the country only to let them go months later.
1846677	1848919	And you kind of sit here and go, there ought to be laws against that.
1850560	1853701	There ought to be fucking laws against that, straight up.
1853701	1860002	And I realized that, you know, again, the push towards unionization and stuff might help with some of that.
1860002	1865743	Now, whether folks are unionized or not, like this was going to, they can do this.
1865743	1869484	They have to give certain types of notices and things like that with union involvement.
1869484	1875165	But, you know, the fact if they were unionized or not would not necessarily impact this decision at the end of the day.
1875165	1876565	It just might have impacted how it played out.
1877405	1885790	Um, but, uh, like this type of shit where they're uprooting people, moving them and all that, it's gotta be illegal.
1885790	1898939	Or there ought to be some type of, you know, penalty to the company that does it to make it a lot less attractive of an option, like a tax penalty, or lack of tax write off penalty to the companies that do this.
1898939	1903442	So anyway, what do I know?
1903442	1905403	I just have a podcast, not a gaming company.
1906121	1907784	But I play a lot of games and so do we.
1907784	1911750	So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1911750	1913172	And then we'll get into some other news.
1913172	1914635	So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1915646	1924873	Mine's pretty lengthy, actually, mostly because I was testing out games, translations of them in different things.
1924873	1928796	And then I bought Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.
1928796	1934761	I haven't started it yet, but I wanted to play because it's open world and I love that universe.
1934761	1938184	I played X-Men Arcade at work.
1938184	1939605	Bam.
1939605	1942748	And you know who else was there playing it at work?
1942748	1943008	Drew.
1944315	1951060	Dracula X, Nocturne in the Moonlight, R-Type, Strider 2, Captain Commando, Summer Carnival 92, Wrecka, Dodonpatch to make myself cry,
1969193	1979657	and then of course my usual streaming stuff, Rurounou Hiho, which I'm getting pretty far in that game, I think I'm on like day 12 on the third scenario.
1979657	1997383	I've been playing some Baldur's Gate 3, I started over on that one, playing Genshin Impact, the game I didn't think I would like and now super like, and of course Cult of the Lamb, although I think my Friday Cult of the Lamb night is going to become a Genshin night, just saying.
1998683	2004585	I blame Orange Rite.
2004585	2006125	I blame them paying me.
2006125	2011667	You know what I made on that sponsorship from them?
2011667	2012307	10 bucks.
2012307	2013827	You know why?
2013827	2019509	Because people who were doing me the favor to make the account already had accounts and it tracks IP.
2020605	2026149	I am super happy because I have enough to pay for my TwitchCon ticket when it comes up and the party.
2049105	2052526	So I've been very, very pleased.
2052526	2058888	You know, I'm not going to say it's going to pay all my bills, but the support of people have been really great.
2058888	2064150	And it has allowed me to expand some stuff that I can do for Orange Lounge, too.
2064150	2066131	Like the new intro I'm working on.
2067416	2074699	Um, are you speaking of which, since you brought up TwitchCon, I think we should probably let our listeners know a few things here.
2074699	2077300	So DarkSakura, of course, you're going to TwitchCon again.
2077300	2078660	That probably won't surprise anybody, right?
2078660	2079200	Yeah.
2079200	2080201	Yep.
2080201	2082342	Loki, what do you think?
2082342	2084382	You want to go to TwitchCon this year?
2084382	2084863	Yeah, sure.
2084863	2086643	Let's I'll go to TwitchCon.
2086643	2087304	Yeah.
2087304	2088964	So you are going you have not been to it.
2088964	2093046	When was the last time you went to a convention?
2093046	2093426	It was 2009.
2093426	2093446	E3.
2097196	2105460	So you have not been to a convention since 2009, but what I'm getting at is here, you are- Could have been the like Sacramento, the game thing.
2105460	2106821	Academy?
2106821	2111524	Not Sacramento, it's like the- Oh, the indie developer collective, which is nice.
2111524	2119768	It's a cute little, but I think we know the difference between a local day show and a, you know, a mega con that, you know, gets talked about nationwide.
2119768	2123110	So- No, I've already got my hotel booked for,
2123590	2125111	So you are going to TwitchCon 2024.
2125111	2129013	And here's here's the interesting thing.
2129013	2130733	I am on the fence right now.
2130733	2135596	And a big part of the reason why and if I go it's going to be a last minute kind of decision.
2135596	2142179	A big part of the reason why is that it's two weeks after DragonCon.
2143880	2151447	They changed the timing and it's two weeks after DragonCon, which Alan and I take an entire week off work to make happen.
2151447	2156291	Now, granted, there's the Labor Day holiday in there, but DragonCon itself goes Thursday.
2156291	2158192	Yes, Thursday is the official day.
2158192	2161355	Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, like the con itself is five days.
2161355	2166179	And with the flights and everything, we stay an extra day to catch up with Bobby and friends in the area.
2166179	2170283	And so we can like, you know, go to the wrap up that the digital media track usually does and stuff.
2170683	2198244	like like we end up out there for an entire week which is great and that's that's always going to be my number one priority in the conventional world like that's just like I've gone to over 10 Dragon Cons now I think this is actually gonna be my 11th in person this year that's always gonna take precedence so it's very tricky that TwitchCon is two weeks later because that makes trying to navigate my day job and my responsibilities there a little trickier I will yeah they're usually early October
2198624	2202329	Yeah, and they moved to mid September and that makes it a lot harder for me now.
2202329	2214745	I'm not saying no, because I'm my it's, I will say that, you know, again, I don't, I have a policy about not really getting into my day job here on this show, especially because I found out I have co workers that listen, by the way, hi, you know who you are.
2215986	2222309	But in all seriousness, I never talked about it.
2222309	2222909	I warned him.
2222909	2225390	I said, I used the F word on that show.
2225390	2228271	You know, it's not that's a side of me you don't see during the day.
2228271	2237255	But anyway, anyway, it probably like I could probably do a Friday because Fridays tend to be a little lighter.
2237255	2238356	I'm not going to get into specifics.
2238356	2239756	Fridays tend to be a little lighter.
2239756	2241277	So I can probably take a Friday and like
2242284	2267257	Get fly down there Thursday night literally fly and like come back Sunday I might be able to swing that But I also kind of don't want to do it unless Alan can do it because he's actually more into twitch than I am ironically Yeah, that's the thing is like I'm not like I don't stream much on twitch I would like to stream more on twitch, but you know there's a thing called time and the limited amount of it that's in a day that doesn't really work out for me, but
2268417	2270598	Yeah, I just want to go there to see the Hermitcraft people.
2270598	2283203	Like, it's a completely selfish need of mine, but, you know, that and, like, other people that are, you know, streamers and stuff that I play with and whatnot.
2283203	2285104	I don't even know what TwitchCon is.
2285104	2289086	Like, I don't know what I'm going to do there for all of the... I'm leaving.
2289086	2292647	I'm coming in Thursday, leaving Monday, so... Yeah.
2292647	2293208	I don't know.
2294471	2295592	We'll see.
2295592	2297232	So yeah, we'll see.
2297232	2307418	Another thing that I like to do at TwitchCon is look at the new equipment that is coming out for streaming and music mixing and things like that.
2307418	2308638	There's some good stuff.
2308638	2309519	That could be fun.
2309519	2311280	I don't know.
2311280	2314922	And certainly I would like to meet up with people and try to network even though
2315902	2320788	Every part of my body doesn't want to do that, but like I know I need to.
2320788	2327997	It's, you know, it's that whole introvert, you know, forcing myself out there and type of thing.
2327997	2332322	But yeah, I think it'd be fun to like get to hang out with some of these people.
2332322	2334024	Hopefully can do that.
2334024	2335146	Have a good time.
2335146	2335266	Yeah.
2336784	2344448	Um, it's I'm gonna say though, if there ends up being a GDQ Express thing at Twitch, and Bobby ends up going there too.
2344448	2348349	So he's got the same Dragon Con problem I do, but maybe not the travel issue so much.
2348349	2351771	So if he ends up there too, then it's gonna be it's gonna get harder and harder.
2351771	2360355	But I you know, obviously, if my day job is like no, it's you know, or I just feel like it's gonna be too difficult to navigate, then no, I'm not going to do it.
2360355	2362256	But I will say this, I will say this.
2363328	2372315	If for the first time ever, I get a panel at TwitchCon, if I can do a panel at TwitchCon, I'll I'll just fucking make it happen.
2372315	2374957	Like, I'll just I'm gonna make it work.
2374957	2380661	I have to because at that point, it's like, okay, if I if I've got that type of thing at TwitchCon, I'll make it happen.
2380661	2383423	So I'm gonna just put that out there into the universe.
2383423	2386105	If I can get a panel at TwitchCon, I will just
2387935	2392681	I'll drive down Friday after work and just not sleep to do a panel at TwitchCon, okay?
2392681	2393402	If I have to.
2393402	2396967	Like, that is- that is what I'll do.
2396967	2398008	Alright.
2398008	2404316	Well, I still- I'm still looking at getting folks for an Airbnb.
2404316	2405818	Um, you know.
2408867	2409988	I think it would be great.
2409988	2417614	I did that the first year I went, and honestly enough, it was a lot of fun.
2417614	2427763	We had five of us staying in the Airbnb, someone slept on a cot in the front room, so it ended up being pretty affordable.
2428649	2432150	was that was that the one with intoxicated or he had to rebrand?
2432150	2432890	Yeah.
2432890	2433410	Okay.
2433410	2433870	Yeah.
2433870	2435631	No, he's back to intoxicated.
2435631	2436791	That was a temporary thing.
2436791	2437091	Oh, good.
2437091	2438171	I'm glad they got it back.
2438171	2438711	That's great.
2438711	2439912	Okay.
2439912	2442632	Um, all right, let's move on.
2442632	2443673	We got on a Twitch content.
2443673	2449574	I thought I thought the listeners ought to know maybe for their own planning that interesting things are afoot this year.
2449574	2454075	And it looks like Loki may have the capacity to do conventions again.
2454715	2455996	I just wanted to.
2455996	2464160	I saw it happen and it was a very impulse thing of mine where I was like, I just want to go somewhere and do that.
2464160	2466701	So I was able to book it.
2466701	2470884	My wife may come with me to not go to TwitchCon, but to like...
2471724	2480129	go do other things while she wants to like meet up with a friend like hopefully get a friend to come down to my old roommate Johnny's in San Diego.
2480129	2487053	Johnny would love to see her I'm sure so and there's there's a lot to do in San Diego like San Diego is a great place.
2487053	2488874	So yeah, have a good time.
2489734	2491455	All right.
2491455	2494717	Anyhow, let's let's move on.
2494717	2497840	We'll let you know con developments as we come across them.
2497840	2504864	In the meantime, let's get into the gaming news of the week.
2504864	2506145	Oh, my gaming week.
2506145	2506765	Oh, no, that's right.
2506765	2507526	We didn't even do it.
2507526	2508206	I'm sorry.
2508206	2508507	You're right.
2508507	2509447	I didn't do mine either.
2509447	2509647	Sorry.
2509647	2511088	We got derailed from DarkSakura's week.
2511088	2512469	I didn't even check if DarkSakura finished.
2512469	2515131	Did you finish DarkSakura?
2515131	2515511	Yeah.
2515511	2516652	OK, then Loki, your gaming week.
2518072	2520493	I did Minecraft stuff, as usual.
2520493	2525536	Editing, put out an episode today that I've been procrastinating on for a while.
2525536	2532939	Mainly because I've been working hard in Fever Dream 2, which is wrapping up on Tuesday, I think, at the end of the month.
2532939	2537561	So I need to film the last bits of that, but I had a total of...
2540237	2544161	3, no, 4 builds that I did on that server.
2544161	2547785	Each were over 25,000 blocks.
2547785	2548526	The largest being 75,000.
2552665	2559290	Yeah, I'm going to edit it in a way to be the most obnoxious YouTuber possible.
2559290	2561712	So basically, the whole premise is it's a fever dream.
2561712	2563393	It's a nightmare, sort of.
2563393	2568577	And so the content is basically the complete 180 of what I normally make.
2568577	2570238	And it's going to be ridiculous.
2570238	2571880	It's all meme builds.
2571880	2575462	It's all memes.
2575462	2578285	And everybody on the server loved it because they're like,
2579542	2580483	Oh, that's horrible.
2580483	2583865	But I also love it.
2583865	2585426	So look for that soon.
2585426	2590249	And, and, and I am testing merch right now.
2590249	2592170	So merch coming very soon.
2592170	2602977	I got my artwork commissioned from Karakato, who redrew and he's a great Mega Man fan artist.
2602977	2603097	And
2603739	2610864	He redrew all of my Robot Masters and my player character in a Mega Man, like a classic Mega Man style.
2610864	2613066	It's so fucking good.
2613066	2614867	It's just so good.
2614867	2626435	And so I'm making t-shirts out of that because I need to have, I need to have two of them because I already ordered two, but if they come back quality good, then I will link everybody to the store and we'll put more stuff on there and, you know.
2627737	2628839	Really, I just want a t-shirt.
2628839	2630642	I'm not looking to make any money off this stuff.
2630642	2632646	It's really just, I just want the artwork on a t-shirt.
2632646	2633908	You need something to wear to TwitchCon.
2634380	2634960	Exactly.
2634960	2636301	That's exactly my thought.
2636301	2638182	That was exactly my thought process.
2638182	2639123	All right.
2639123	2639683	Yeah.
2639683	2642345	We need some new VOG stuff, so I have something to wear to DragonCon.
2642345	2643305	I'm in my old VOG stuff.
2643305	2647568	I love that baseball jersey.
2647568	2661296	If this site ends up working out, because it was easy to set up, and they have a lot of options as far as the different types of things you could get printed, and also the different, like, it's not just like t-shirt, it's
2662316	2665698	Many, many, many, many, many, many, many types of things.
2665698	2667039	All the crap.
2667039	2667839	Yeah, all the crap.
2667839	2671341	So you can really customize what you want to do.
2671341	2673022	And setup was free.
2673022	2676684	So if this does work out, I'll point you in that direction.
2676684	2679165	And I think it may work out pretty good.
2679165	2679385	Great.
2680711	2681612	All right.
2681612	2685736	Well, if that's it for your game of the week, I'll make mine quick since I was eager to jump ahead.
2685736	2689180	Pretty much a lot of the same stuff I've been talking about FF14.
2689180	2701714	A good friend of mine IRL started playing so it's been kind of fun revisiting like the old content again because I'm trying to help him through but actually he's been kind of doing a lot of it on his own because you can do it all with NPCs now you don't have to wait to group up for all that's nice.
2701934	2726079	yeah so um he's he's already almost like to the end of base realm reborn he's only been playing for like a week so um it's pretty cool um so i've been playing a lot of that and then uh diablo 4 the latest season season 3 started and um i i hate to say this but like you know especially in lieu of some previous things we were talking about and some of the negative stuff with blizzard but like i i'm gonna keep it real and i'm not gonna sugarcoat things
2726519	2731623	The season in Diablo 4 is not in a good place, and it's not particularly fun.
2731623	2734966	The twist is not good.
2734966	2753040	I don't know why it was felt that in a game where it's all about mow down the enemies as fast as you can, watch the numbers fly, explosions everywhere, why it was felt that a good mechanic would be, let's have rooms full of traps to slow you down.
2754011	2761457	And so you have to do platforming and try to like get all the mobs to get you what it's just, I don't know how they fix it.
2761457	2762278	That's the problem.
2762278	2764280	It's a fundamentally broken concept.
2764280	2769164	But to Blizzard's credit, they are quickly trying to fix it.
2769164	2778852	For example, and I think this is the most ridiculous of all the things they've done in the season is that you have this thing where like you put a pearl in the altar before you start the dungeon.
2778852	2782775	And if you can get it counts down every time you get hit by a trap,
2783535	2786798	3, 2, 1, the treasure disappears at the end.
2786798	2789020	Or half the treasure disappears at the end, or something like that.
2789020	2791622	So you can get hit with a trap 3 times, that's it.
2791622	2794564	I was able to do that in 5 seconds when I ran it.
2794564	2804691	Now Blizzard has already patched it, so now it counts down from 10 instead of 3, and it's like a 1.5 second gap from getting hit before you can get hit again.
2804691	2810496	So I will give Blizzard props, they are trying to address it pretty quickly, and they are monitoring player feedback.
2810876	2819638	So props for that, but I just think the concept at its core was not thought through the way it maybe should have been.
2819638	2820878	Sorry.
2820878	2824159	It's the weakest season compared to 1 and 2, quite frankly.
2824159	2827220	And that's my opinion.
2827220	2830241	But I'm still playing it because...
2831212	2834515	I love Diablo and I need the cosmetics and I'm a consumer whore.
2834515	2835896	Yay.
2835896	2836917	All right.
2836917	2838258	And how.
2838258	2838678	All right.
2838678	2846325	Now we're going to move on into, oh, Questbuster says the drama around the issues with season three have kept me from trying it so far.
2846325	2847826	Also, Infinite Wealth.
2847826	2848447	Yes, yes.
2848447	2850488	Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth came out.
2850488	2857954	Our pal Bobby talked at length about it on his show because y'all know he loves the Yakuza series, especially ever since he kind of started
2858755	2862037	Unofficially being the team up for that with games done quick.
2862037	2862957	I mean, nothing.
2862957	2870060	It just seems like whenever there is a Yakuza game and the runner that runs that game, I feel like Bobby is always there for the last three years.
2870060	2871281	So there's a part.
2871281	2875323	But I mean, you know, he just I think genuinely likes the series where it's gone.
2875763	2882925	I like it too but we all know the meme that I haven't finished the last game yet because I get distracted by all this other stuff.
2882925	2886506	So I do really feel like I need to go back and finish the last game.
2886506	2887647	Yes, I do.
2887647	2889067	I would love to do it.
2889067	2891088	But as far as my priorities go,
2892108	2899791	Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is out at the end of the month, the day I get home from my cruise that I'm going on.
2899791	2905593	So I've got about three weeks to replay Final Fantasy VII Remake on PlayStation 5.
2905593	2908754	And that's kind of my my more immediate plan.
2908754	2915337	And then at one of those, you could watch Neko-chan do it.
2915337	2917638	Oh, are they streaming it?
2917638	2918218	Yeah.
2918218	2918398	Oh, OK.
2920997	2925820	And for the same reasons, in anticipation of the new release.
2925820	2927881	Gotcha, gotcha.
2927881	2934784	Yeah, I mean, it's sometimes hard for me to follow the narrative game stuff on streams, because if I miss anything, then I'm like, I missed it.
2934784	2942568	But yeah, I mean, sometimes I did watch Lapin play a little bit of it, but only the parts that I had already played.
2942568	2943028	Gotcha.
2943028	2943188	Yeah.
2945563	2949229	Alright, um, let's move into some gaming news.
2949229	2956641	Now we can move ahead and Loki is going to start us off with the game that just like it's it's uh, it's not going away.
2956641	2957903	And it's making its mark on 2024.
2960628	2963611	PowWorld has been doing incredibly well.
2963611	2974204	It just came out in Early Access on January 18th and already has sold over 7 million copies and that was 8 million.
2974204	2975225	That was as of a few days ago.
2979454	2985299	I can only imagine that, yeah, 8 million copies in 6 days.
2985299	2988121	So it's doing incredibly well.
2988121	2994987	Of course, you know, with all the attention on it, you know, there's been a lot of speculation, like,
2996906	3003294	This game obviously is very inspired by Pokemon.
3003294	3008741	Was there some foul play in the sense that maybe some of the designs were stolen?
3008741	3011085	And of course, people being...
3012250	3019052	company tryhards decided to point out to the pokemon company in case they weren't already aware that hey some of the stuff looks you know
3027535	3053322	Very similar to your Pokemon and maybe you should take a look at that And so of course they put out a statement the Pokemon company saying we've received many inquiries regarding another games Or another company's game released in January of this year We have not granted any permission for the use of the Pokemon intellectual property or assets in that game we intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to act and
3054549	3058472	Basically look into any infringement that may be occurring.
3058472	3061394	I don't know if there's any infringement.
3061394	3065056	Certainly there's a lot of stuff that's inspired by it.
3065056	3074443	And I know people were trying to come off and say, like, oh, well, some of these look like they're exactly the same as the models if you resize them or whatever the case may be.
3076371	3077052	I don't know.
3077052	3080955	It may be a hard argument to make.
3080955	3086579	You know, obviously we talked about this at length on the show a little bit last week and a little bit about the AI misdirect.
3086579	3089661	In my opinion, all the AI stuff is smoke and mirrors.
3089661	3094885	None of that is relevant to the actual conversation because nobody has proven that AI is in this game.
3094885	3095546	That's that.
3095546	3099669	I mean, yes, the CEO made shitty statements, but all CEOs make shitty statements about AI right now.
3100029	3102870	Every game has AI, it just depends on the nature of it.
3102870	3103710	And that's right.
3103710	3109872	And we talked about, and you're right, you reminded me, we made that separation about AI art is the issue.
3109872	3117114	AI as far as like mechanics, generation, when they talk about, we're going to patch the AI in the game for the animals to be smarter.
3117114	3121435	I don't think people generally have a problem with that AI.
3121435	3124696	It's AI art and art in all its forms.
3125576	3130722	3D modeling, writing, voice acting, art.
3130722	3134085	That's where all of us are taking issue, is AI.
3134085	3137389	Again, all smoke and mirrors when it comes to PAL world as far as I'm concerned.
3137389	3138790	None of that exists in the game that we know.
3138790	3139411	Yeah.
3139411	3144416	And I think AI art isn't even necessarily a bad thing per se.
3144416	3147559	It's just AI art that's trained off of copyrighted works.
3148385	3148886	Yes.
3148886	3150189	Which is all of it.
3150189	3150690	Yes.
3150690	3155359	AIR generating the land in your own engine and all that stuff.
3155359	3156822	Yes, you're right.
3156822	3158225	That's an important clarification.
3159375	3162076	It depends on what the machine has learned from.
3162076	3163036	Yes, exactly.
3163036	3163596	Yeah.
3163596	3185223	Hypothetically, if someone were to actually create a AI art generative program that is based off of original artwork made by like specific artists, like in a company, even like I would, it'd be still be kind of wary, like say, like, let's just pretend that Blizzard decided to create an AI art generative art program.
3185623	3192749	When you work for a company, any material that you present on the company's dime, in the company's facility, on the company's material, belongs to the company after you've left.
3192749	3194611	The same goes with freelance work.
3212486	3216892	You are not entitled to keep that except for terms of your own portfolio.
3216892	3219956	Your client owns the artwork that you make for them once they've paid you for it.
3219956	3221438	People don't like to hear that, but that's 100% that.
3222697	3223938	Yeah, and I get that.
3223938	3228482	And it's more of like mimicking, say, their style or something like that.
3228482	3237990	But whatever, like, right now, that's not a scenario that's actually happened, because I don't think anybody's using models that aren't trained on copyrighted material.
3237990	3241793	But yeah, so essentially, they're going to look into it.
3241793	3244796	I think both companies are out of Japan anyways.
3244796	3249620	So assuming that's the case, it's more of a local type of
3250702	3254083	you know, legal battle there.
3254083	3266087	Japan does not have any fair use laws when it comes to, you know, which even, even if that wasn't, which yes, a hundred percent that, but even if that wasn't the case, a fair use is like the news and commentary.
3266087	3271489	It is not one profitable product in the exact same vein as the other.
3271489	3277171	So again, another fucking social media invented smoke and mirrors bullshit is that whole fair use thing.
3277171	3277711	I'm sorry.
3278331	3279111	Yeah.
3279111	3287036	Here's what it is to me, is that, and I fully expected Nintendo to file the cease and desist this week, so I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen.
3287036	3294719	Yes, I'm aware it happened with the mod that went on YouTube that was like literally Ash Ketchum and Pikachu in the- Right.
3294719	3297401	Yeah, Nintendo shut that shit down immediately.
3297921	3299442	But they didn't shut this down immediately.
3299442	3300603	And that's interesting to me.
3300603	3315495	And the fact that they put out this statement instead is really interesting, because to me, that says that they are hearing this whole thing about is is the actual artwork potentially in the game, like the actual fucking models?
3315495	3316136	Are they in the game?
3316136	3319358	Because if so, that that's that's theft.
3319358	3321620	That's a theft of a different type.
3321620	3324383	And that may be where they're going with it right now.
3324383	3324763	Maybe.
3325003	3325263	and more!
3340405	3356642	They're gonna have to pay their own forensic expert data stuff to go in, figure it out, compare the files, compare the da-da-da-da-da, and they're gonna have to figure out, are Pakachu and Jogglypoof, are they actually Pokemon?
3356642	3356722	Or
3357643	3365149	are they indeed their own created things that are heavily inspired by because that is going to dictate where Nintendo goes with the next steps.
3365149	3371635	And that's that's why we're going to have to wait a little bit because we can't just say, oh, this guy on Twitter said they're the same, so therefore they're the same.
3371635	3376639	No, they will have to have receipts, emails, timelines.
3376639	3382243	They've got to collect all of that stuff before they go to a courtroom in any country.
3382243	3382884	Guarantee it.
3382884	3384145	That's what's being looked at right now.
3385804	3391593	And they've been aware of this game for a while now, I would imagine, because this isn't something that just came out of the blue.
3391593	3392715	Were you?
3392715	3393597	Because I wasn't.
3394918	3396119	I remember the trailer.
3396119	3398280	No, I remember the trailer for it.
3398280	3403203	Yeah, but I mean, but again, this whole like, are the actual models in the game?
3403203	3406265	I don't think that would have shown from the trailer.
3406265	3409227	I don't think they're even saying that the actual models are in the game.
3409227	3416332	I think what they're they're claiming is that basically, they're saying that the PAL world devs
3417597	3425541	rip the models from the Pokemon games and then use that as a basis to create their own models.
3425541	3436266	So basically, okay, hey, I'm going to take a Pikachu out of here and then I'm going to add some horns and do some things and change the texture, but the general body and proportions are based off of something else.
3436266	3442049	That's a little harder to prove, I think, but I mean, they'll do their best.
3445073	3451616	I linked something in chat that I'll go ahead and tell people where to find it.
3451616	3468404	If you look up fair use on collegeart.org, which is a resource I've used myself for my own artwork, it goes into like a real world description on copyrighted material and legit fair use.
3469384	3483914	So, if the Pokemon Company decided to have it out with them, and I'm just thinking in terms of American copyright law, and I'm not an attorney, so blah blah, whatever, I'm not an attorney.
3483914	3490439	The company behind Power World needs to be able to justify their objective in art.
3491950	3499535	and why they repurpose copyright art instead of creating their own work.
3499535	3506020	And then, um... It's... They're not doing commentary on Pokémon.
3506020	3509622	I mean, they might come in and try to claim parody, I don't know.
3509622	3518789	Um, but... They... Even if you are copying another company's work, you are still required to cite them as a source?
3520522	3534521	or either label it in there, embed it, have it in the credits, unless there is a legitimate aesthetic basis for not doing it, and even so, that's a very weak argument.
3534521	3535822	So, just wanted to throw that out there.
3537123	3541685	You know, as far as PowerWorld goes itself, I pretty much feel the same way I do last week.
3541685	3543326	Yes, I played the game last weekend.
3543326	3545047	I actually haven't played it since.
3545047	3547588	And that's not it's just because, again, I've been very clear.
3547588	3552050	I have other gaming priorities right now, like and PowerWorld is still in early access.
3552050	3555271	And number one, it's not cross platform between Steam and Xbox.
3555271	3556952	That's a huge drawback for me.
3556952	3560294	And I think there's just the game crashed on me a couple of times.
3560294	3563055	I think there's still drawbacks of early access.
3563055	3564736	I feel like and I said this last week,
3565376	3574742	The game I'm going to play in six months, assuming it exists and isn't shot out of the sky by lawyers, which I kind of think it will exist.
3574742	3577624	The question is, how much are they maybe going to pay?
3577624	3583388	But I feel like the game I'm going to play in six months is not going to be the same game I played last weekend.
3583388	3584169	I'm not going to touch it.
3586050	3598456	And I kind of, it goes back to this whole thing, like a game that is heavily inspired by as many genres as this game is, because again, this game isn't Pokemon at all to me.
3598456	3601377	This is Ark with Pokemon instead of dinosaurs.
3601377	3603958	That's what this game is.
3603958	3604979	But games that copy
3606027	3623570	Jonners and stuff so explicitly are never as good as this one turned out which is wild and that's what makes this so interesting to see from where a legal perspective this goes but if Nintendo can bring the receipts and emails and all that and if Nintendo proves
3624031	3636726	What, essentially, this company's denying on social media is that, you know, they're saying, we ran it by our lawyers, we know we're legally disdained, da-da-da, but if Nintendo brings receipts to the table that show our fucking files are in that game...
3638451	3646600	This is probably going to be one of the most interesting cases in gaming ever.
3646600	3649723	And I'm putting it up there with like Capcom versus Data East.
3649723	3653267	And this is going to be the biggest thing in gaming ever.
3656613	3665942	I mean, again, I've been that college student before, you know, but I'm gonna say right now, that's gonna fuck over their careers for life.
3665942	3668725	And that's, you know, and somebody else signed off on that.
3668725	3671247	Or told them how to cut corners.
3671247	3673409	But here's the thing, here's the thing.
3673409	3679535	As much as I understand being in their position, I don't want to say, I mean,
3681343	3691710	I think that it should definitely, if that ends up being the case, I think it should absolutely be used as a cautionary tale for all of these other people who are like, oh, I'll do artwork for your channel.
3691710	3696274	And it's all, you know, stolen bits, you know, done with AI.
3696274	3701517	Or, you know, I really, really think that if that ends up being the case,
3702658	3714525	And I feel bad for a new artist having to put that on there, but at the same time, that precedent has gone around that, yeah, it's okay to take from this, that, and the other.
3714525	3715186	You're fine.
3715186	3716166	Go ahead and do it.
3716166	3718108	Don't worry about being too original.
3721991	3728856	People aren't using their own creativity, I think, and are looking for the fast answer.
3728856	3731017	And that may be completely off base, who knows?
3731017	3735300	But I still think that that should be a cautionary tale.
3735300	3751231	What I would like to see the industry do as a response to this, and AI, and all of it, honestly, is I would really like to see us lift up artists in the video game industry, and recognize them, and call them out, and acknowledge them,
3751491	3772212	I'm not saying we have to create a cult of celebrity around it and I understand in the day and age of social media that may be a hard thing to avoid but I feel like the more we can like feature artists and we do this in some places like you know Final Fantasy art and you know character designs and stuff I feel like the more we can kind of do that and recognize and uplift artists and so forth and
3772552	3774813	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3793038	3802684	Booing artists and really lifting up and acknowledging their value and spotlighting them and showcasing them, giving them awards where it's due and all that is help.
3802684	3808088	I think is something we need to do as fans to push back on a lot of this.
3808088	3808768	Absolutely.
3808768	3811690	I mean, it's the comic book industry.
3811690	3812751	I mean, yeah, true.
3812751	3814192	Their main source is artwork.
3814813	3832509	But still, there's a lot of, you know, we have artists in that industry that we talk about years later, you know, you know, we still we still pitch about Rob Liefeld to this day, you know, but I think that that we need to
3833639	3840944	We absolutely need to do that and in fact I think there should just be like a dedicated award thing for excellence in video game art.
3840944	3843326	Specific, you know, visual arts.
3843326	3850451	And then, you know, a music, you know, award given out for compositions.
3850451	3853673	You know, with some of the same categories you might see at the Grammys.
3853673	3859757	You know, Best New Artist, or, you know, Best Composition, or, you know, things like that.
3861462	3870754	DJ Ranma S in chat says, I find it amusing that people are calling this the Pokemon killer and people are playing this and demanding that Game Freak fix the Pokemon game issues and want them to suffer.
3870754	3877283	Let's be real, there's no Pokemon killer and as long as the games sell, I doubt Game Freak will fix those issues people have with the games.
3878124	3894237	I'm gonna, and I know this isn't you saying this, DJ Ranma S, so when I'm about to get on my soapbox and say this, I'm not saying this at you, but I'm saying this at all of the people, and I'm saying this at the media, and I'm saying this at the headlines, and the clickbait that I am continuing to see about this game.
3894237	3897961	This game is not fucking Pokemon.
3898701	3908645	And if I swear to fucking God, if you see an article that says this game is just Pokemon with guns, delete, unbookmark, go away.
3908645	3913667	Do not continue to patronize that website because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
3913667	3921511	They are not bothering to play the games that they're commentating on, and they themselves are control C, control V'ing from other sources.
3922011	3924392	They are guilty of the things that they are saying.
3924392	3927273	This is not Pokemon with guns.
3927273	3933735	I am sick and fucking tired of seeing that is fucking lazy to call this game Pokemon.
3933735	3935395	You haven't fucking played it.
3935395	3942837	If you're calling this game Pokemon, there are no turn-based battles in this game, which is what Pokemon is.
3942837	3947939	The real issue is semi-colon dramatic pause for effect.
3949022	3961794	The real issue is this is a survival game with potentially, allegedly, lifted, read stolen, Pokemon assets.
3961794	3963676	That is the problem.
3963676	3970102	This is a survival game with potential Control-C, Control-V Pokemon in it.
3970102	3971804	That's the issue.
3971804	3973906	You call this Pokemon with guns again?
3975600	3981103	I hope to God a virus inflicts your computer and uninstalls Steam for you.
3981103	3981923	Hey Rob.
3981923	3982684	Yes.
3982684	3985385	Baby Yoda.
3985385	3990168	Same thing.
3990168	3990808	All right.
3990808	3992469	It is.
3992469	3994710	It is.
3994710	3997032	But.
3997032	3998032	Anyway.
3998032	4000874	But I'm also willing to admit, I don't watch a Star War.
4003604	4008767	I'm not trying, I'm not trying to profit off of clicks on articles talking about Baby Yoda.
4008767	4010147	Grogu.
4010147	4011708	So anyway, all right.
4011708	4015410	He was just called Baby Yoda before we knew the name of the character.
4015410	4018071	Then afterwards, people call him Baby Yoda.
4018071	4019171	Well, those are stupid people.
4019171	4019912	But you know what?
4019912	4022573	It's fine.
4022573	4025534	He had an official name in canon at that point.
4025534	4026635	He was just referred to as the Child.
4027489	4029871	Yeah, but that could be any child that's in that.
4029871	4030492	I'm happy.
4030492	4033835	I'm happy the live listeners are eating the child.
4033835	4036178	I'm happy the live listeners are eating up my rant.
4036178	4037359	I had to get that off my chest.
4037359	4039361	I hope the podcasters enjoy that too.
4039361	4042504	Tiger Claus says something here.
4042504	4043525	I've got to respond to it though.
4043525	4048290	It says they say that because of the imagery and taking it out of context.
4050538	4060300	In one sentence, you have defined the entire problem with social media as it is today.
4060300	4062081	Marinate on that.
4062081	4065121	I'm going to read Tigerclaw's comment again.
4065121	4073443	They say that because of the imagery, the picture, the headline, and taking it out of context.
4076007	4085551	I don't know if Tigerclaw realizes in one sentence he has just summarized the entire fucking problem with Twitter.com.
4085551	4087652	That's not isolated to Twitter.
4087652	4088253	No, it's not.
4088253	4088713	No, it's not.
4088713	4089673	That's everything.
4089673	4091114	It's mostly Twitter.
4091114	4092174	But yes, no, it is.
4092174	4092875	It's threads.
4092875	4093615	It's Instagram.
4093615	4094375	It's TikTok.
4094375	4095216	It's all of it.
4095216	4096076	It's all of it.
4096076	4097257	It's humanity.
4097257	4102359	People for millennia have looked for
4103243	4112531	Well, I mean, think about, you know what book titles were like maybe 200 years ago where there were like extra descriptions and they went on for four entire fucking lines?
4112531	4115854	Now books have like a single word.
4115854	4123741	It's nature to try to isolate things to the easiest and simplest description to make it comprehensible.
4123741	4125282	That's just human nature.
4125282	4125803	It's lazy.
4127001	4135607	The most egregious example of this that everybody knows is movie posters and movie advertisements that take a review completely out of context.
4135607	4141451	You know, um, this movie was visually beautiful, but what a hunk of steaming shit it was.
4141451	4147555	They'll put the quote that says visually beautiful said Time magazine on the movie poster, right?
4147555	4150777	Like taking shit out of context to advance your own agenda.
4151809	4155351	you're yeah, DarkSakura 100% cosigned.
4155351	4157173	That's a tale as old as time.
4157173	4162836	And social media is just our shining beacon example of that right now.
4162836	4171122	But especially twitter.com just because of because of because of the owner of twitter.com who is the worst offender in this category.
4171122	4171362	All right.
4173075	4176838	Anyhow, we're gonna move on, we're gonna move on.
4176838	4182001	Let's talk about what is happening with Overwatch 2's competitively.
4182001	4186845	I had heard that the layoffs at Blizzard this week, you know, affected some people with Overwatch 2, and I hope
4188257	4192579	You know, I hope they haven't, um, scaled back on this game too much.
4192579	4199862	Cause I feel like I'm, I'm enjoying playing Overwatch with friends and I do get in there and do it, you know, I'm not good at it, but you know, we have fun, we laugh and that's what it's all about.
4199862	4207526	So video games are, I know some people take it a little more seriously and really enjoyed things like the Overwatch league to give them something to root for and to the better their game.
4207526	4211788	Some people were watching a lot of football games today and they'll be watching another one in two weeks.
4211788	4215590	Some people like to watch the Overwatch league and unfortunately there is no more Overwatch league.
4215590	4216370	So what is next?
4217389	4227633	Well, Blizzard has teamed up with the ESL Faceit group, the EFG, to run what is called the Overwatch Champions Series, which is going to be the OWCS.
4227633	4239438	It's going to be an open format circuit where teams from North America, Europe, Middle East, and North Africa, EMEA, and Asia, they can all compete without having to have their own franchise.
4239438	4243480	EFG is going to operate the Overwatch Championship Series in North America and EMEA.
4243900	4248741	while Korean esports organizer WDG will be over this in Asia.
4248741	4251382	It's gonna have regional qualifiers and tournaments.
4251382	4260004	There will be in-person events at DreamHack Dallas, which is starting May 31st, and DreamHack Stockholm on November 22nd.
4260004	4263465	Sorry, Bobby, I don't see DreamHack Atlanta here, but who knows?
4263465	4271867	Eight teams will compete at the events, and then those that qualify for DreamHack Stockholm will duke it out and become the first Overwatch champions.
4272507	4276070	Um, that's also going to be the first time this has been played in Europe in five years.
4276070	4279733	Qualifiers start in February, more information to come.
4279733	4283436	So, I mean, it is interesting that now it's like you could kind of make your own team.
4283436	4290381	It's not going to have like, you know, the San Francisco Shock and all the, you know, kind of the league behind it.
4290381	4298127	Um, but they're still trying to make sure that this plays out on a large, visible stage, such as DreamHack.
4298127	4299368	So, interesting.
4301175	4304697	So, Squenix has revealed that there has been some
4321863	4329714	Well, action taken for people that are selling counterfeit merchandise in China.
4329714	4332738	Well, distributing counterfeit merchandise in China.
4332738	4337845	They put out a press release that detailed that nine people were charged in May 2023
4339547	4342249	and Guangdong Province.
4342249	4347272	Six were involved in distributing products, while three were charged for manufacturing.
4347272	4352216	This included character items from Final Fantasy and NieR Automata.
4357559	4366283	And they first filed the request, and I'm going to quote, based on information gathered through independent investigations.
4366283	4376987	And they worked with an investigation firm, others in the industry, and basically laid the smackdown.
4376987	4379888	So, I mean, I remember back in the day,
4380618	4389086	of, uh, you know, having to check and see, is this a real, is this a real Vincent figure?
4389086	4394111	Is this a real Dragon Ball CD or is it Sonmei?
4394111	4395212	You know?
4395212	4401398	So, it was pretty, it was, uh, they're protecting their stuff, they have a right to.
4404013	4409554	Yeah, especially something like Square Enix is kind of prime stuff to get counterfeit products made too.
4409554	4415336	So I'm actually I actually kind of surprised this is like, you know, we don't hear about this more often.
4415336	4417796	Unfortunately, it's interesting.
4417796	4421657	I think that there's just a lot of difficulty in being able to this.
4421657	4426018	I mean, this is going to be a very minor dent in the counterfeiting room, you know.
4427791	4435679	And I mean, we would see like identical covers of things released, but the company name changes.
4435679	4442486	You know, it's, it's, uh, yeah, you want to, you want to double check where you're coming from.
4442486	4451094	You want to be sure, publish, like, I remember, remember my quest to find a non bootleg, uh, Bust a Move 2 soundtrack?
4451094	4451455	Oh, yes.
4452941	4457282	If I found one, I paid 45 bucks for it because I needed the real thing.
4457282	4462864	I have the same with my original Bust A Move soundtrack and one of my, uh, two mix albums.
4462864	4468685	Um, but, but yeah, you know, you want to, you want to read those labels.
4468685	4478328	You want to know what you're looking for and don't get me started about, did I tell you that someone sent me a bootleg purse and an Hermes Birkin bag?
4478328	4478708	Oh no.
4479938	4483080	I have a fake Birkin.
4483080	4490806	I might go out with it sometime and just see who notices, but I have a fake Birkin that someone sent me because it was funny.
4490806	4495870	But yeah, you want to just be 100% certain of of what you're looking at.
4495870	4498672	Pay attention to things.
4498672	4499153	All right.
4499153	4504997	Well, moving on on a completely different note, Loki.
4504997	4505477	Loki, I think.
4505477	4506078	Are you muted?
4506078	4506518	Yeah, I know.
4506518	4507399	I know the families.
4509747	4518511	So the Nintendo Switch online service for the 3DS and Wii U are going to be shut off on April 8th at 7 p.m.
4518511	4519832	Eastern Time.
4519832	4528136	At that time, you will not be able to play the Wii U or 3DS online anymore.
4528136	4529217	Well, that's unfortunate.
4530922	4534305	We knew this was coming, so it's not... Eventually, yeah.
4534305	4539991	And also the Pokemon stuff is exempt for now, which is the one thing a lot of people have been asking about.
4539991	4544255	The two things that are working are Pokemon Bank and PokeTransporter.
4544255	4549260	Those are going to continue to operate.
4549260	4550542	For now.
4550542	4551663	For now.
4551663	4554746	Until there's something, something else, maybe.
4556201	4563286	Um, speaking of something else, Nintendo has set some new dates for some concerts that were going to be rescheduled.
4563286	4567309	I don't know if you all remember, but there was supposed to be a Nintendo Live 2024 in Tokyo.
4567309	4570331	It was going to be January 20th, 2021.
4570331	4576396	I don't know if you remember, Nintendo received credible threats targeting employees and the spectators.
4576736	4579458	The Legend of Zelda concert will be on Nintendo's YouTube channel February 9th at 8am Eastern.
4598815	4604159	and the Splatoon 3 concert will be February 10th on the same, you know, YouTube channel.
4604159	4606641	But they haven't announced the official time for that yet.
4606641	4609884	Although you can gather it's probably going to be a similar time.
4609884	4612326	And if you're wondering why is it so damn early?
4612326	4614408	Well, because it's for Japan time.
4614408	4616670	So it's a little different when you consider the time zone changes.
4617410	4634646	some people have been kind of running with this as oh nintendo's gonna announce something in early february because they're doing the concerts in early february i'm i mean i i kind of think that's wishful thinking i mean i'm not saying they're not doing that i just think people
4635447	4644532	People are really hoping and wishing that a new Switch announcement is true and in the very near future, but wishing and hoping doesn't make it true.
4644532	4648454	And so, you know, these types of things are maybe coincidences.
4648454	4650315	I hope it is true, but I really think it is.
4651235	4654238	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4668052	4677575	They still did the concerts at the event with just nobody there, and they recorded it so all those people could still, you know, get paid and do their thing.
4677575	4683477	And they're going to put it out on YouTube now at this particular time that's not too far in the future after that happened.
4683477	4690340	So they have a little time to edit it together and, you know, clean it up a little bit, maybe make it a little more television presentable.
4691801	4697968	I really think that's all it is and we don't need to tinfoil hat about when the new Switch is being announced.
4697968	4707459	Although, I guess this is a good place in the show to bring up the rumors are heating up on the Switch's successor and oh, it's an 8-inch LED tablet and all this stuff and
4708015	4711576	you know, yeah, there's probably a lot of that stuff out there that is true.
4711576	4724719	But at the end of the day, we're not going to know until we know which on Nintendo's timetable will be Tuesday afternoon, they're going to say Thursday morning, you're not going to want to miss this direct.
4724719	4726799	And that's that's as much notice as we'll get.
4726799	4733020	So here's hoping it's this week, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
4733020	4735701	All right, moving on to something a little more classic DarkSakura.
4739861	4741721	Y'all know I like Laserdiscs.
4741721	4744042	I have a bunch of Laserdiscs.
4744042	4746363	And other people like Laserdiscs too!
4746363	4747483	Yay!
4747483	4758706	So, the Japanese Game Preservation Society, in their annual newsletter, has started doing their first migration of Laserdisc games.
4762913	4777086	They were talking about in part of bringing in things like of course Dragon's Lair, Road Avenger, games that have already been converted to CD game, but now they're bringing in things that were for the MSX.
4779008	4785135	Starfighters is one of them, compared to Advanced Wars.
4785135	4795187	And then there was Don Quixote, A Dream in Seven Crystals, not to be confused with Super Don Quixote, but it's like an RPG.
4797429	4801732	maps, random battles, stuff.
4801732	4810719	And of course, looking at various different ways to emulate them.
4810719	4821446	Like, the arcade games have Daphne, MSX have OpenMSX, right now there is no known emulator for the Pioneer Laser Active.
4821446	4821806	So,
4823688	4841501	Since that particular game, the Don Quixote, A Dream in Seven Crystals, was on LaserActive, you know, this is now making this game that's going to be, it's going to make it an unavailable game unless you have the system in the game, and they put it out there for you again.
4841501	4852129	And the thing is that they're not just backing up the video footage, but they are capturing all of the data contained within the game data,
4855792	4862098	They're sampling everything at the highest quality that they can sample.
4862098	4867962	They're saying it's like 8 terabytes per laserdisc.
4867962	4876490	They are passing it through a decoder so they can decode the analog video, all digital data and audio tracks as well.
4878731	4886217	And so once they bring it in and be sure that it will read, then they can work on conversion.
4886217	4890620	So they have to also develop ways to read PCM data.
4890620	4892782	So they're putting into it.
4892782	4894323	They're putting into it.
4894323	4900388	So I'm really excited to see what comes out of it.
4900388	4901769	I want to see their success.
4901769	4907794	And of course, if this works with these laser active games, they can expand this into
4908614	4916263	others in the LaserActive library and other systems out there.
4916263	4924192	And Laserdiscs, I mean, first of all, they're kind of harder to find, for one thing.
4924192	4928917	You can't find... Well, working players are harder to find.
4932067	4943174	It's not super difficult to do a repair on a Laserdisc player, but there are parts that you have to order specialized from companies where you create it.
4943174	4944935	I mean, just sort of like with pinball.
4951434	4958180	Today, we, you know, while we have Blu-ray and all of this, you know, this was our digital media.
4958180	4966847	And there are lots of, you know, issues that can go on with a laser disc, you know, apart from being scratched or otherwise damaged or heat damaged.
4966847	4970170	There is a there's a thing called disc rot.
4970170	4972372	I might have explained it to people before.
4972372	4974774	I don't know if anyone remembers.
4974774	4978857	For example, there was, I think, a version of I want to say Beauty and the Beast.
4981058	4986940	It's one Disney movie that like half of their pressing ended up having disk rot.
4986940	4990361	And so now that laser disk is very valuable.
4990361	4998164	But basically, what happens with disk rot is that
5003716	5014684	There's lots of layers on there that are usually aluminum, they can be mixed with different chemicals, and sometimes it will...
5016505	5022708	create these little bubbles, I guess, like spots under them.
5022708	5030892	And so those layers in between them can become contaminated and they're unreadable.
5030892	5040416	So, I mean, the biggest cause is oxidation, but others with contaminants and ultraviolet light damage, like leaving them out in the sun.
5040416	5043838	And they were far more susceptible to that than, of course, our modern DVDs.
5043838	5045459	CDs also are susceptible to it.
5046419	5052823	Um, but making sure that you find discs in pristine condition to do this.
5052823	5061288	I mean, it could get expensive, you know, I, I remember how expensive laser discs were just ew.
5061288	5065271	And now, um, you know, you're looking for some of these rarer games.
5065271	5074676	It's going to be, it's going to be pretty expensive to find, you know, when they're getting into the later games of, of acquiring some of these.
5074676	5075617	So anyway.
5076684	5081366	Well, a lot of people in chat very happy to hear about game and media preservation.
5081366	5084588	SJ100Matt says, yay for game and media preservation.
5084588	5087730	Dr. Seuss says, indeed, always cool to see this kind of stuff preserved.
5087730	5091371	QuestBuster with fingers crossed that they succeed on this.
5091371	5094893	SJ100Matt going so far as to suggest, I want a LaserDisc mini console.
5094893	5097875	Put the light gun games on there as well as Dragon's Lair and the other classics.
5097875	5098475	Sign me up.
5098975	5100056	Yeah, I'm down.
5126840	5147411	maybe maybe it'd be funny if they had like if they just came with like little DVDs in them to sort of mimic a laser disc or like the three inch mini discs now for the state like a little three inch like GameCube games were that those are yeah I love those yeah that'd be funny all right uh moving on Loki
5148877	5151518	All right.
5151518	5159420	So the day before is finally gone from the Internet, or at least gone from all of their official accounts.
5159420	5163261	So we knew the game was shutting down.
5163261	5165141	The website's gone inactive.
5165141	5166742	The game's been pulled from Steam.
5166742	5168182	The servers are now turned off.
5168182	5174904	And then, of course, right before they decided to inactivate their Twitter account, they also blamed
5176104	5184789	the players and social media folks out there for the failure of their game, saying that they were too hard on it.
5184789	5192394	I don't think that's fair, but what they did, that's that's the way they got to blame something.
5192394	5194135	So let's blame somebody else.
5194135	5195736	Yeah, don't take accountability.
5195736	5198078	So but it's gone.
5198078	5200359	And let this be a lesson.
5200359	5203701	For something, but don't always believe the hype, I guess.
5203701	5204842	Push F to pay respects.
5206104	5206444	Bloodborne
5229117	5240708	Originally all started as an April Fool's joke and it was being brought to light and now the creators have been contacted by Sony, the IP holders, because this game was originally going to release at the end of the month.
5240708	5247694	But the indie team says, long story short, we need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart.
5247694	5249956	We will do this but that requires a short delay.
5250476	5258540	So, um, you know, they kind of assure that the game is going to look different, but, and it's no longer going to be Bloodborne, but it is still coming.
5258540	5262562	So I guess it's just going to be, you know, souls-like horror.
5262562	5263823	No, or souls-like cart.
5263823	5266464	No, I don't know what they can, probably can't call it that either.
5266464	5270406	So, uh, it's going to be just called something else, maybe in line with it.
5270406	5275109	Um, and we don't know the new release date, but they're saying we will let you know ASAP when we do.
5276269	5283050	We were expecting something like this to happen and the idea of having full creative control is kind of exciting.
5283050	5285431	That's a really weird comment to me.
5285431	5293033	Why did you commit to a release date of the month as it was if we were honestly expecting something like this to happen?
5293033	5296473	That's almost like you were intentionally pushing Sony's hand.
5296473	5298174	That part of it is weird.
5298174	5299794	Everything else I'm cool with, but I'm like,
5301667	5302347	Why would you say that?
5302347	5304308	I don't get people.
5304308	5307969	Anyway, this was first announced in early 2022.
5307969	5310030	Lilith Walther is the developer.
5310030	5315752	They were also behind the Bloodborne demake, which was like Bloodborne on the PS1.
5315752	5323615	Bloodborne Kart will have 16 maps, 12 racers, a full single player mode, boss battles even, and split screen multiplayer.
5323615	5327637	But it will no longer have actual characters from Bloodborne.
5327637	5328577	So that's that.
5329659	5330500	All right.
5330500	5332481	Well, you were surprised.
5332481	5333282	No one.
5333282	5334423	Yeah, no one.
5334423	5335504	All right.
5335504	5344771	Let's let's talk about other classic games here that deserve inspirational successors in a segment we love to do here at Orange Lounge Radio right after this bumper.
5355518	5363265	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5363265	5367889	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5367889	5370331	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for this week?
5372133	5385656	I picked Radical Dreamers, not to be confused with Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross, although there is a tie-in eventually.
5385656	5394078	But Radical Dreamers came out in 1986, and it's a text-based visual novel adventure game.
5394078	5401100	And it was done by Square for the Satellaview, the online peripheral for the Super Famicom.
5401540	5404922	and it is part of the Chronos series.
5404922	5421129	So, that's why I'm saying there were, like, there was, uh, the Chrono Trigger Radical Dreamers edition that did include Radical Dreamers, but this, I'm speaking of the, the, the standalone on it.
5421129	5424491	So, that's, that's my, my point.
5424491	5431154	Um, anyway, uh, the game, uh, basically you are, you are, uh,
5432702	5446374	Doing an infiltration led by Kidd, aided by Surge and Magil, and you're looking for an artifact called the Frozen Flame, and to get some revenge too.
5446374	5450478	And so you have to go through, it's all text choices.
5450478	5456463	It was also directed and written by Kato Masato, who was the Chrono Trigger writer.
5459504	5465148	And it was very, it was a lot darker, I'll put it that way, darker than Chrono Trigger.
5465148	5474794	Although there were some, you know, funny scenes in there, music was also done by Mitsuda Yasunori, who did the music in Chrono Trigger.
5474794	5478376	And it happened in three months and Kato wasn't really happy with it.
5481918	5490902	It didn't get a big commercial release because it was, you know, Satellaview exclusive to Japan.
5490902	5502428	And Kato actually did not want it on the PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger because of quality concerns, but the ROM had been released and there is a fan translation.
5503568	5515841	Um, so, moving onward, like I said, this is a text-based adventure, and like, when you get into combat, you have to choose, you know, fight, magic, run, you know?
5515841	5520525	Um, and sometimes there'll be some more complex commands, like...
5521306	5526790	Like, stab something in chest, slash at hand, you know.
5526790	5531574	And you have to make these quickly before a timer runs out.
5531574	5538900	You have health being monitored, although you can't see, it's invisible.
5540501	5552511	You have Kids Affection for Surge that is also tracked and it determines whether or not he survives the end fight.
5552511	5559297	A lot of the scenes are rendered with static backgrounds.
5559297	5563801	I mean, as those who are here live can see.
5567191	5573616	But you also do have a variant of New Game Plus.
5573616	5576898	So it is only available on the first playthrough.
5576898	5585325	So after you get your one ending, you go through and you can do other endings.
5585325	5589228	You have up to six endings.
5589228	5594331	And some of them are funny and they allude back to different things that happen in Chrono Trigger.
5596853	5619031	But basically, you're going through, you have different scenes, different areas, like you have the Viper Manor, you have a lot of exposition, of course it happens since this is in text, you find Ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal,
5619791	5633481	For example, you learn more about Luka from Chrono Trigger, who is, of course, Kid's adopted caretaker.
5633481	5639085	So there are all these other scenarios that are available to play that are, like I said,
5639625	5657278	Funny or serious, you know, six different ones and of course it was developed by Square and it was supposed to cover the unfinished business of Chrono Trigger but
5659560	5660600	I don't know.
5660600	5662001	I haven't actually played it yet.
5662001	5666422	This has been on my list to play for a moment.
5666422	5677644	There's a lot of the darker writing came from Kato's state of mind, like kid being kind of nihilistic.
5677644	5684646	But his whole goal with this and for Chrono Cross were to encourage people to
5686468	5690691	you know, to follow their own personal dreams.
5690691	5701980	Although he said there was a lot of personal freedom in creating this and that making it a text-based adventure made it more acceptable to make it darker.
5701980	5705682	And it was sort of like a survival action.
5705682	5709525	But, you know, Resident Evil had just come out.
5709525	5709785	So,
5711434	5720576	But yeah, he considers the game to be unfinished, because Square wanted it done in two months.
5720576	5727898	The music, of course, is absolutely gorgeous, done by Mitsuda Yasunori.
5727898	5736601	Some of it is a little bit more relaxed than how some of the things have been for Chrono Trigger, and he said that he was very influenced by Russian folk music.
5739223	5748973	And then some of the music in there eventually made its way sort of as quotes for Chrono Cross.
5748973	5754318	Yeah, about half the music in Radical Dreamers was reused in Chrono Cross.
5754318	5755339	As far as
5757984	5767250	Other releases that it got, like I said, there was a fan translation, but it did get an official translation as part of the Chrono Cross Radical Dreamers edition.
5767250	5784361	And then it had a worldwide release April 7th, 2022 for Microsoft Windows, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One with translations in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German.
5784361	5784862	It was...
5786454	5800760	It was very well written, it was an interesting plot, and it was fairly decently received, but other people did agree that it felt a little unfinished.
5800760	5808204	But this was considered a very in-between story.
5808204	5815227	However, Kato said he wanted to redo Radical Dreamers properly, and that's what led into making Chrono Cross.
5816147	5825891	So he wanted to finish Kid and Surge's story and so that's why they're the main people in Chrono Cross.
5825891	5834855	So they even refer to different events in Chrono Cross for things that happen directly in Radical Dreamers.
5834855	5838117	So basically, Radical Dreamers
5839688	5844571	is like an alternate timeline for them.
5844571	5858480	Kato was supposed to be, well, he confirmed, by the way, that the character Gil was supposed to be Magus and was going to be in Chrono Cross, but he was scrapped from it, for example.
5858480	5860581	So just all kinds of different things.
5860581	5865885	And this is one that had been on my radar to play.
5866887	5875814	And I never got around to it, but there's a lot of people who don't exactly realize what this is, you know.
5875814	5879377	And I just wanted to give it a little bit of love.
5879377	5880658	So there you go.
5880658	5881999	It's Radical Dreamers.
5883636	5885037	All right.
5885037	5891240	Admittedly, one I have not, I mean, I knew of this game, but never played it myself.
5891240	5895502	And yeah, I keep forgetting, like, oh, there's like a text adventure game on the Super Nintendo.
5895502	5896783	And it was Satellaview.
5896783	5897323	Yeah.
5897323	5899884	So that's the big thing.
5899884	5909669	And I agree with what Questbuster said, because I was going to be going over that, is that it's been in the attempts to preserve a lot of the Satellaview games.
5911190	5918632	One of the few of them, I think, that got a full release outside of Japan.
5918632	5920033	Yeah.
5920033	5920313	All right.
5920313	5921893	Yeah.
5921893	5922273	All right.
5922273	5923374	Well, good.
5923374	5926355	If I made a band, I'd call it Radical Dreamers.
5926355	5928555	I bet some of these had to have taken that name by now.
5928555	5931136	It was also a song in Chrono Trigger at some point.
5931136	5931476	It was.
5931476	5932056	In Chrono Cross.
5932056	5932217	Yeah.
5934400	5939924	Alright, let's check out some other quick headlines from around the industry in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
5939924	5941925	So Loki, some headlines quick.
5942833	5968954	Yes, apparently the producer of Zelda, Eiji Aonuma, was spotted at Universal Studios on site during the park construction of their new section, which I think is the Donkey Kong themed area.
5971055	5978157	But yes, leading to suspicions that could there be a Legend of Zelda part of the theme park coming?
5978157	5981378	I mean, yeah, obviously at some point.
5981378	5982518	For sure.
5982518	5988099	They're not going to not make one of their popular properties into theme park fodder.
5988099	5990700	I mean, that is eventually going to happen, I think.
5990700	5994081	But as of right now, no, nothing has been confirmed other than
5994961	6000784	Why are people spying on people at the construction sites for a theme park?
6000784	6005867	But you do you, I guess.
6005867	6007628	This is a little bit disappointing.
6007628	6015693	Remember how there was supposed to be this big live action Final Fantasy 14 television series?
6015693	6016413	Yeah, it got canceled.
6017398	6019380	We took around a fantastic pilot script by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton.
6039017	6045502	along with a multi-season plan they built with our showrunners, but got rejected across the board.
6045502	6052367	The size of the scale needed to do it right proved too much for anyone to want to risk.
6052367	6053848	That's too bad.
6053848	6056410	All right.
6056410	6059392	DarkSakura.
6059392	6063374	Lael, I spent money on a thing, Rob.
6063374	6064015	Uh-oh.
6065273	6067375	Was it this in the story?
6067375	6069396	Oh, I love it.
6069396	6077883	So Microids Records is helping to commemorate the Atari 50.
6077883	6083647	They have an anniversary soundtrack that is going on with Atari.
6083647	6091173	That is a collection of just different, you know, songs and sound pieces
6092133	6096094	Ever since 1983, composed by Bob Baffi.
6096094	6101076	And it's just a big homage to the history of Atari.
6101076	6105998	It's going on shelves on April 17, 2024.
6105998	6109439	And I ordered this for myself as an early birthday present.
6109439	6109779	Love it.
6110765	6123208	I forgot to mention during my gaming week, I busted out the Evercade that I talked about a few weeks ago, because I got some of my, I ordered some more cartridges, some, some that went out of print, including the Atari Collection 2, which has Yars' Revenge on it.
6123208	6129409	So I absolutely did play Yars' Revenge and yet another collection this week, but some games never get old.
6129409	6132450	And that's one of them.
6132450	6133810	I don't know if I'll be getting the vinyl though.
6133810	6134651	That might be a lot.
6134651	6139712	So it's, it's on gold vinyl.
6141012	6145614	and really beautiful packaging.
6145614	6146615	You know, minimalist.
6146615	6147835	I'm into it.
6147835	6149336	Yeah, totally getting it.
6149336	6154318	D'Artesia in chat says, I'm just surprised this didn't get an 8-track release.
6154318	6155699	That would have been fitting.
6155699	6156439	All right.
6156439	6158620	Did I tell you Dan gave me an 8-track the other day?
6158620	6160441	No, that's awesome.
6160441	6161722	You know what it is?
6161722	6162882	Please say ABBA.
6162882	6165023	Fleetwood Mac Rumors.
6165023	6166404	Oh, that's a good one, too, though.
6167651	6168532	And you want to know what?
6168532	6169112	What?
6169112	6173956	When I was a kid, I used to own this same album on 8-Track.
6173956	6175237	Oh, I love that.
6175237	6176478	I love that.
6176478	6177259	Yeah.
6177259	6177679	All right.
6177679	6178940	Well, let's talk about this.
6178940	6181402	Stevie Nicks is a goddess that walks this earth.
6181402	6182043	Mm hmm.
6182043	6183304	She's pretty cool.
6183304	6184244	All right.
6184244	6187947	Going back to going back to rapid fire news.
6187947	6188728	I want to talk about this.
6188728	6190690	This crossed our desk this week.
6190690	6193492	It's Hilltop Works is the name of the company.
6193852	6195933	And they actually put out a tweet this week.
6195933	6198615	Hilltopworks, they localize Japanese video games.
6198615	6199416	They do patches.
6199416	6203598	For example, they recently did Rowdy Princess on the PlayStation 2.
6203598	6206920	They kind of did a whole little translation patch for that and so on.
6206920	6208682	So they do a lot of stuff.
6208682	6210403	They actually put out a poll.
6210403	6215466	They said, is there a Japan-only retro game that you'd love to see an English fan translation for?
6215466	6217807	I now have a suggestion forum where you could submit requests.
6217807	6219849	So they have a whole little forum there.
6219849	6219989	And
6220871	6222592	Why am I bringing it up here on OLR?
6222592	6228596	Because one of the top replies on Twitter, President Kat.
6228596	6229336	Yes.
6229336	6229776	Or the game.
6229776	6230497	You know what?
6230497	6233739	I didn't even realize this was in our show role.
6233739	6236260	And I was just replying to it at the start of the show.
6236260	6237921	Oh, I thought you saw it on the show role.
6237921	6238442	That's funny.
6239719	6242300	Suki Ban So Chow Ren Owi, DarkSakura
6259269	6266172	and I asked DarkSakura to translate it back in like 2008 or 2009 when this was first a thing because it was on the Nintendo Wii.
6266172	6268653	And she said, Oh, it's basically President Cat.
6268653	6280358	And that that made me get on my whole soapbox about why aren't we releasing this kind of stuff on the Wii here in the US is everybody would play a fucking game called President Cat.
6280358	6281638	Everybody loves cats.
6281638	6285120	Even if you're allergic, you can't help but think cats are a little bit adorable.
6285120	6285860	Like we need
6286340	6287040	More games like this.
6287040	6291542	So it is it is really funny to me.
6291542	6293482	15 years later, there might finally be redemption.
6293482	6299044	You know, it's going to be a pain in the ass to localize.
6299044	6305346	I mean, given the graphical elements on top of that, that are are, you know, have writing on it.
6305346	6307146	But you know what?
6307146	6308386	I'm making this happen.
6308386	6310047	I'm going to make President Cat trend again.
6310307	6320479	But I'm assuming Hilltop Works has, I mean, if they're doing stuff on PlayStation 2, they're in there, you know, patching those, you know, newer consoles as well.
6320479	6324404	So there's already Wii fan translations existing.
6324404	6327167	So, yeah.
6327167	6329390	We need to have a President Cat TV show now.
6331346	6334227	Honestly, would be better than a lot of the crap they're putting out there now.
6334227	6336148	So there you go.
6336148	6336868	All right.
6336868	6343911	Let's travel around the world and see what games are coming out this week, even if President Cat is not is still not yet one of them.
6343911	6345072	Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.
6345072	6345352	this week?
6346055	6350117	Not a lot, but we're in January, so it's to be expected.
6350117	6359403	We have The Lost Legends of Redwall, The Scout Anthology on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6359403	6364846	Rugby 24 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6365882	6370686	BlazBlueEntropyEffect on PC.
6370686	6378073	We've got GrandBlueFantasyRelink on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6378073	6388242	We've also got Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.
6388242	6389723	Mixi is totally into that anime.
6391283	6393425	Yeah, I have no idea what this anime is.
6393425	6396307	Probably kids watch it, I bet.
6396307	6399129	PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6399129	6406034	Persona 3 Reload on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6406034	6414661	And last but not least, and I didn't realize it was even coming out this soon, but Suicide Squad killed the Justice League on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6414661	6418824	We'll see how that game turns out this week.
6418824	6419124	That's it.
6420305	6428627	Just really quickly, on a random aside, I can't believe I've never thought to do this, but just all this talk about President Cat this evening made me do this.
6428627	6438030	Did you know if you Google President Cat Nintendo Wii, you get this game, even though the top result is not that?
6438690	6441012	So there is enough out there.
6441012	6445576	Like the fact that, you know, we gave it that label name Wikipedia for it.
6445576	6452122	If you gave it President Cat Nintendo Wii, you get this game and you get all these random YouTubes related to this game.
6452122	6456506	And then way down here, you finally get gamers looking to get this localized.
6456506	6460229	And then the whole it was the worst selling Wii game, which, by the way,
6461070	6469936	I just wanna, I wanna point out here, and this is only from like a year ago or something, the only one I'd ever seen for sale, nobody ever fucking proved this.
6469936	6477080	This was like an article written for one website that everybody ran with, and the proof was not exactly there.
6477080	6490149	Because, and you wanna go back to that thing about context and all that stuff, about, you know, getting the, actually you wanna see, they paired it with pictures of somebody doing the demo at the store, where there wasn't like really a line, or there wasn't everybody,
6490569	6494792	It was one store and who knew how much promotion or anything they put into it.
6494792	6498275	And somebody else had even said, I was there at that event.
6498275	6502318	And yeah, some of the time the table was empty, but a lot of the time it was hopping over there.
6502318	6502938	So I'm sorry.
6502938	6509603	Nobody ever proved that it sold as shitty as it did, except for the fact that you're going to tell me a game with cats doesn't is not going to sell.
6509603	6510384	I'm sorry.
6510384	6512506	Loki bought like three of those copies.
6512506	6515348	If it really only one of them won.
6515348	6518931	If it only sold 100 copies, how many of them were sold over here?
6519824	6522547	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6537587	6538268	Thank you for watching!
6558697	6575533	Well, moving on, let's talk about Japanese releases, because I got distracted a little bit there with, you know, President Cat being... I was also gonna say, like, I thought it was always funny, too, that President Cat wore cat ears, even though they are cat, so that's strange.
6575533	6578936	It's like wearing a mask of a human, even though I am, in fact, human.
6578936	6579857	Yes, exactly.
6579857	6580097	All right.
6581278	6582698	Moving on.
6582698	6600803	Let's talk about some releases in Japan on the Nintendo Switch this week, and no, President Cat is not one of them, but Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash is coming out in Japan this week, as well as The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered is out in Japan this week on the Nintendo Switch as well.
6600803	6608284	The Enigma Machine and Alterity Experience, I'm guessing that's a combo pack game, is coming out as well.
6608284	6610065	Yeah, it looks like it's two games in one.
6611064	6612065	Jujutsu Kaisen Curse Clash
6633566	6640948	Legend of Legacy is also out, HD remaster, on the PlayStation 5, so it's a pretty similar week between the two systems.
6640948	6643729	I will- Holy shit.
6643729	6647970	Are you that excited about Legend of Legacy, DarkSakura?
6647970	6657033	No, I'm looking at people selling the game for 12 grand, Rena, Wii.
6657033	6657333	What?
6659983	6680872	some people in eat their sealed copies and then an open one is like 500 that's stupid oh my god loki you might have like stadium events sitting in your garage somewhere i don't have stadium events in my garage no but that's you that's my point you have this somewhere anyway it's not sealed though because i have opened it up but yeah
6682261	6683683	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
6700252	6706417	In January, on the 30th, we have Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League Deluxe Edition for PlayStation and Xbox.
6706417	6711921	On the 31st, for the same devices, we have Arcade Game Zone.
6711921	6717666	And then February 2nd, for PlayStation, we have Crossfire Sierra Squad.
6717666	6723971	On PlayStation Switch and Xbox, we have Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash.
6723971	6726253	PlayStation Xbox Persona 3 Reload.
6728295	6736201	And also for PlayStation and Xbox, I guess the regular version of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League.
6736201	6736802	There you go.
6737967	6742390	We have just a few more stories for you and then we'll open it up to the listener roundtable.
6742390	6747032	I think we have at least an email this week and maybe some other comments and chat and so forth.
6747032	6749494	Until we get there, let's go to Loki.
6749494	6751495	A couple of headlines for us.
6751495	6752556	Yep.
6752556	6757439	Uh, can we get good news regarding game companies?
6757439	6762542	But apparently, PUBG publisher Krafton Inc.
6762542	6766264	has been named in a wrongful termination and sexual assault lawsuit.
6766832	6768754	Yay, in California.
6768754	6770817	Yay, because this is what happens.
6770817	6775643	Nobody can operate a company correctly anymore.
6775643	6779548	Uh, so yes, rejoicing.
6779548	6785435	I don't know there's rejoicing but uh, you put that sound put that soundboard down and step away from the soundboard.
6788135	6792597	Yes, so of course, you know, the representative for Crafting Inc.
6792597	6799401	says that they're treating all allegations of improper workplace conduct with the utmost seriousness.
6799401	6800261	Yeah, sure.
6800261	6800542	Whatever.
6800542	6801242	I'll believe you.
6801242	6803083	OK, whatever.
6803083	6808986	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what's happening with some sort of lawsuit with this.
6808986	6812728	Or if we will hear about this, is this going to become the next Activision Blizzard thing?
6812728	6815409	I don't know.
6815409	6816210	Wait and see, I guess.
6819126	6821288	So I'm gonna take a step.
6821288	6841324	I'm gonna make a stab at something I'm going to try not to get ranty about it, but I'm gonna say it now Parents Teach your boys to respect women The end No arguments here Loki let's do a palette cleansing different headline, please
6842558	6849747	Yes, so Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth is the series biggest Steam launch ever, which is great.
6849747	6852850	I'm glad to see that it's doing well.
6852850	6856355	People in this country finally know what Yakuza is.
6856355	6856815	Exactly.
6856815	6859178	Now that they changed the name to Like a Dragon, everybody knows it.
6860569	6867976	Yeah, they've had peak concurrent users on that game of almost 31,000 at a time.
6867976	6875943	The second place goes to, of course, Like a Dragon, Gaiden, the man who erased his name, which was, I think, the last release that came out.
6875943	6877104	That was 13,000.
6877104	6880988	And then prior to that, Yakuza Like a Dragon, which was 95,000.
6884010	6884110	100.
6884110	6890335	So it's going up every release like and significantly jumped up from the last one.
6890335	6897900	Although I want to say maybe the last one wasn't as appealing, maybe because if it's a different time period, but certainly a threefold, 300% increase.
6897900	6903324	That game you mentioned, the one that was just under this, that was more of a bridge game.
6903324	6909348	It was a short 10 hour game that bridged the story of the current protagonist and the former protagonist of the Yakuza series.
6909348	6910289	And it was more of a beat him up.
6910769	6918298	So yeah, that that I think that game was kind of noticed by less people because it really served more as a kind of a bridge game.
6918298	6919659	It wasn't technically a mainline game.
6919659	6922803	I do need to finish like a dragon and I probably need to play this.
6922803	6923624	It looks good.
6923624	6927729	Yeah, Bobby had a lot of good things to say about it tonight on his show, and I don't doubt it's good.
6927729	6931132	But he did also say it really does help to have played the first game.
6931753	6932213	DarkSakura
6951969	6958731	You can, although last time I threatened to do that, Bobby reminded me you can watch chapter summaries in the game.
6958731	6960352	Like they do have recap stuff.
6960352	6962693	So you can kind of get yourself caught up on the story.
6962693	6966454	I just remember that I was at a point where I had to make like 3 million yen or something.
6966454	6967975	I remember what it was.
6967975	6968495	And I was like,
6968968	6969028	and
6992361	6996944	Maybe I'm not going to drop $70 to check this game out, but I'll check it out because I have Game Pass.
6996944	7002027	And now they're dropping $70 on the sequel because they really enjoyed what they played.
7002027	7002227	So.
7002227	7004308	I think that's cool.
7004308	7004468	Yeah.
7007070	7014852	Bobby says the money gate was killer if you didn't save scum in the poker room, which I guess is a way that people get through it.
7014852	7018233	And Bobby also says it's not just summaries, it's all the cut scenes.
7018233	7024755	So you can pretty much watch the movie of Like a Dragon if I need to get caught up, which I probably will someday.
7024755	7033037	I will say I saw one part of the new game because Alan was calling it out on Lapin's stream.
7033777	7045853	was playing it and it was like a tinder clone type of thing where like uh there's like a little tinder mini game and he was getting all these like catfish people and it was really you know it was kind of funny but then like
7046761	7066735	legitimately, one of them is like a real sexy woman, but like, read like actually real, like not rendered in the game, like they somehow fused it with like, 4k footage of a real, you know, Japanese woman like being very like, you know, sexy and all that stuff.
7066735	7070958	And, you know that it was really funny.
7070958	7074100	It was it was in the same tone of a lot of
7075532	7078914	You know, like a dragon is where the pendulum swings hard one moment.
7078914	7080756	It's a very serious crime drama.
7080756	7082717	And then the next moment, it's a fucking cartoon.
7082717	7083497	And this was one of those.
7083497	7085259	It's a fucking cartoon moments.
7085259	7088061	So but that's what makes it fun.
7088061	7088901	Yeah.
7088901	7092924	All right.
7092924	7095566	Questmaster says, Yeah, the Tinder part is great.
7095566	7097907	Bobby says mismatch is hilarious.
7097907	7101129	They're actually Twitch streamers.
7101129	7102470	That's funny.
7102470	7104392	Was the model at the end there a Twitch streamer?
7105134	7117460	What a great, what a great credit if they were because that was a pretty, you know, it wasn't a long cut scene, but it was still to like have a real person in the game mixed with the, you know, rendered.
7117460	7121902	Well, it was it was one of those things where like the camera never showed them both.
7121902	7126584	It's like your first person perspective from Ichiban's perspective, and it was all like real.
7126584	7128185	It's very interesting, though.
7129634	7130575	All right.
7130575	7133437	Oh wow, the FMV are all streamers.
7133437	7138420	They used VTubers as their IRL selves in FMV and Like a Dragon Gaiden.
7138420	7139321	Oh my gosh.
7139321	7142863	And Questmaster points out all of it as optional content, but it's still hilarious.
7142863	7144144	Yeah.
7144144	7144685	These games have
7145325	7150228	tons of optional content because the whole Sega arcade we often forget is in these games.
7150228	7155691	Like there's there's literally like five classic Sega games in every Yakuza game they've ever put out.
7155691	7159594	We're always sitting here going, why did Animal Crossing strip out the Nintendo games?
7159594	7160835	That was the best part of the game.
7160835	7165798	Meanwhile, Yakuza is over here going, hello, we have classic Sega games in our games.
7165798	7166758	Hello.
7166758	7172282	And if I remember correctly, there's like an Animal Crossing type like mini game that's in this one, too.
7172662	7173563	Oh, shit, really?
7173563	7174363	Probably.
7174363	7175984	Why wouldn't there be?
7175984	7178446	So like, that sounds interesting.
7178446	7179547	Yeah.
7179547	7180968	I love it.
7180968	7181428	All right.
7181428	7185611	Anyway, a good note to end on one of those games we'll get to eventually.
7185611	7189493	Let's get to the listener roundtable and get your comments and perspective.
7189493	7194497	Whether it's through our email bag, participate at Orangetrader.com is the place to send an email.
7194497	7198039	Or you can always message us in our chat as well.
7198039	7198880	I'm going to be honest.
7199580	7201821	I'm not really checking the social media these days.
7201821	7205664	In fact, I missed a message that was kind of important by like a week.
7205664	7210127	Because I'm not really on Twitter unless a news article takes me there.
7210127	7213148	And then I'm like, oh, OLR has an alert on the account.
7213148	7213589	What's that?
7213589	7216791	Oh, we got tagged in 10 different posts about Bitcoin.
7216791	7217871	Oh, what's this one?
7217871	7220733	Oh, this is one I might want to respond to.
7220733	7222414	So yeah.
7222414	7225816	Anyway, just we're not great on social media at this point.
7225816	7228178	But if you tag me on blue sky, I'll see it like in five minutes.
7228638	7229659	It's just, that's where I'm at now.
7229659	7231722	Blue Sky is the superior location.
7231722	7233123	I 100% agree.
7233123	7234004	100% agree.
7234004	7246979	But it's just, I, I go, I look at Twitter, but I feel like the scene where Arthur and the Knights approach Camelot in Monty Python and the quest for the Holy Grail.
7246979	7248040	Let's not go to Twitter.
7248040	7248881	It's a silly place.
7251963	7260369	And can we, by the way, can we have a moment to acknowledge and applaud that Blue Sky was mentioned at Games Done Quick and who may have been responsible for that?
7260369	7262370	Can we applaud that please?
7262370	7266032	Because yes, I agree, Blue Sky is the superior platform.
7266032	7268154	It is, yes, it's missing direct messaging.
7268154	7272537	Yes, it doesn't have video, but they have the integrated YouTube and Twitch and that stuff now.
7272537	7273357	They're getting there.
7273357	7275058	DMs are on their roadmap and stuff.
7275058	7281142	They are further along in the time they've been up than Twitter in its early days got, you know, so they're doing their best.
7283884	7293246	SSJ100 Matt says Twitter is full of anal spiders and I wonder if that's another word for antisemitic people so I can just call them anal spiders.
7293246	7306350	He's referencing a meme that happened to discord this week because it was it was this whole back and forth about basically I said Bobby Kotick is an anal spider basically and it was it's it goes back to that 2dx song.
7308164	7308624	Oh, okay.
7308624	7311366	Cause I was going to say AS, you know, for both.
7311366	7315208	I'm like, I'm going to steal that friend for anti-Semitic people.
7315208	7316909	You sure should.
7316909	7321071	Hamas is full of anal spiders.
7321071	7324633	But I will say on a serious note about blue sky, what makes it superior?
7324633	7327815	And this is, this is what people often forget.
7327815	7334499	There are no ads and you are in complete control of your algorithm.
7335399	7341064	That is why it is 100% better than Twitter, Facebook, threads, any of it.
7341064	7345727	You are in control of your algorithm, and people build custom algorithms.
7345727	7349430	If you want an algorithm that is nothing but pornography,
7350475	7351916	that exists for you.
7351916	7358261	If you don't want to see that and you want to if you in fact, Bobby Blackwolf made a custom feed all about Dragon Con.
7358261	7362945	If you want to see every post on Blue Sky that talks about Dragon Con, Bobby made a feed for that.
7362945	7366248	So there's there's also you can create your own sort of feeds that way.
7366248	7368670	And that's why but I was good.
7368670	7374755	But Twitter still comfortable for people because that's where Lady Gaga is and where all the newsmakers still are.
7374755	7378318	So I understand it's difficult, but it's a fucking cesspool.
7378678	7379519	Make the switch.
7379519	7380840	You won't regret it.
7380840	7381601	All right.
7381601	7385084	The more people that make the switch, the less you'll feel that anyway.
7385917	7388238	I have five invite codes, y'all.
7388238	7390538	Yeah, I have invite codes, too.
7390538	7392598	I will pass them out like they're candy.
7392598	7394259	Anybody is more than welcome.
7394259	7401840	If you're affiliated with VOG Network and you're here Sunday nights or even if you email us, get a hold of me on Discord, vognetwork.com.
7401840	7404381	Like all of us are oozing in invites.
7404381	7411562	Like the invite wall is very easy to get around at this point, but it still is very effective at keeping bots and spammers out.
7411562	7414683	It's not perfect because people foolishly post their codes on Twitter.
7415503	7419024	without, you know, doing something to redact it and bots pick it up.
7419024	7423106	But it certainly slows it way the fuck down.
7423106	7426267	I actually hope Blue Sky just stays invite only permanently.
7426267	7428928	It's not hard to get on if you just ask.
7428928	7430028	All the cool kids are.
7430028	7430848	Yeah.
7430848	7432029	So but come to.
7432029	7432569	Don't be shy.
7432569	7434110	You can be one of us.
7434110	7436130	That's right.
7436130	7437471	OK.
7437471	7439271	Speaking of one of us emails, right.
7439271	7442332	Participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send us an email.
7442332	7443773	And I believe we have at least one tonight.
7444827	7446328	We have one.
7446328	7450651	I had to make sure the other one wasn't old one because someone doesn't clean out the mailbox.
7450651	7452512	It all gets forwarded to my other email.
7455663	7457344	Hello, peoples!
7457344	7472276	So, I have been slowly following the online Discord about PalWorld, both because I've been on my ski staycation 2024 for the past two weeks, and because I honestly do not care.
7472276	7481062	Between me catching up on Checkpoint, part of the Loading Ready Live universe, and other online gaming things, I still am not motivated to care.
7481903	7483564	So, should I?
7483564	7486905	Honestly, should I or anyone else care about Pal World?
7486905	7497670	I am someone who is delving into my back catalogue to the point that the games I'm currently playing are Jeanne d'Arc on PSP and Dragon Age
7498930	7502572	Do you mean Inquisition instead of Insurrection?
7502572	7506573	But honestly, should I or anyone else care?
7506573	7508314	Stay care, Red Retainment.
7508314	7514837	This message has been brought to you by those mustaches the members of the elite are wearing for some yet to be explained reason.
7514837	7515457	You see.
7515457	7516478	No, don't care.
7516478	7522360	You see, what happened is he was playing Dragon Age Inquisition while he was watching Star Trek Insurrection.
7522360	7523821	And sometimes these things happen.
7523821	7525621	So, yeah, that's all.
7525621	7527062	I don't you don't you don't have to care.
7528507	7529048	It's not great.
7529048	7530869	You don't have to care.
7530869	7533592	I don't think you should have us answer this question for you.
7533592	7536715	Like I'm very flattered that we would answer this question for you.
7536715	7537336	I don't think you should.
7537336	7539137	I don't think you should care about our opinion or anyone else's.
7539137	7541079	I just said he doesn't have to.
7541079	7544022	And I'm saying Reddertainment doesn't need to listen to you.
7544022	7544623	You can do what you want.
7544623	7545724	You're an adult.
7545724	7546224	Exactly.
7546224	7547506	You're an adult.
7547506	7549187	Like, here's the thing.
7549187	7551449	We've gone over the- You can have cake for breakfast.
7551449	7552190	You're an adult.
7552190	7552771	That's right.
7553291	7560694	You can steal Pokemon and make your own game and suffer the possible legal repercussions of that.
7560694	7562675	You're a fucking adult.
7562675	7565136	Here's the thing.
7565136	7566076	Here's what I mean on a serious note.
7566076	7568757	It's like putting on your underwear, you know?
7568757	7573479	As long as you put some on, it's fine and it's clean, but like...
7574463	7576424	No one needs to know what color your underwear on.
7576424	7580846	If you care enough to pick out a specific color and make of your underwear, then that's up to you.
7580846	7582167	But we don't all have to know about it.
7582167	7583928	Well, Jamie, a lot of guys don't.
7583928	7585849	So that's that's also up to you.
7585849	7587830	That's a personal choice.
7587830	7591172	It's just don't don't ask me what underwear you should put on today.
7591172	7592452	You make that decision.
7592452	7593233	Here's the thing.
7593233	7598195	And and I do have to explain to SSJ 100 Matt about cake for breakfast.
7598195	7602838	When I moved out here and I had cake for breakfast, I took a picture of it, sent it to my mother and said, I'm an adult.
7604807	7609988	Here's the thing, I do want to, Rentertainment's been listening for a long time and I don't want to make it sound like I'm mocking.
7609988	7613669	I mean, I think it's nice that somebody would ask this question somewhere.
7613669	7614689	Here's the thing.
7614689	7618450	We did, we talked about all the discourse trademarked and all that stuff earlier in the show.
7618450	7622751	At this point, I feel like you should have some type of inclination.
7622751	7624511	Is this game for you or not?
7624511	7627692	And the biggest thing is you, you heard me say it.
7627692	7634473	It's a survival game, but the dinosaurs from Ark were replaced with Pachymon.
7637609	7642010	legally distinct, question mark, to be determined, Pokemon.
7642010	7645971	If that sounds like a game that's of interest to you, sure, put it on your radar.
7645971	7651152	If it sounds like, wow, I hate survival games, you know what, there's like 10 other games that came out this week.
7651152	7654973	Bobby would prefer that you play Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, quite frankly.
7654973	7657594	And it sounds like Jamie would as well.
7657594	7657734	So
7659655	7676990	You really kind of have to decide on your own merits and don't let anyone, us, Twitter, Blue Sky, TV, YouTubes, TikToks, don't let anyone make those decisions for you.
7676990	7681174	That's all.
7681174	7683316	And if you want to have cake for cake for breakfast, do it.
7683316	7686098	All right.
7686098	7686699	And you know what?
7688692	7690734	I don't care what your undies preferences are, just saying.
7707555	7708436	Bucket of Coffee
7729517	7740070	So, Mantis.com is still looking like some, uh, uh, uh, Comic Sans GeoShitties realness on here.
7740070	7745076	The site is still there.
7745076	7745276	Anyway.
7745276	7745997	Go get your Mantis.
7747205	7759268	I really want to change the subject and go to chat and see if there's anything that you want to ask us about or talk about, preferably in gaming and not, you know, in the underwear section at Target.
7759268	7763109	Just, you know, something you want to ask us about.
7763109	7767310	SSG100 Matt says, I heard there's a game called Tunic that folks should play.
7767310	7772592	Oh, I think that's a reference to a Redertainment's question there about should I play Powerworld?
7772592	7773352	No, play Tunic.
7774554	7775755	That's that's good.
7775755	7776555	That's the recommendation.
7776555	7777676	Yeah, Tunic's pretty good.
7777676	7779137	So Red Entertainment, maybe I will.
7779137	7780098	I will hear your question.
7780098	7784040	I'll say no, play Tunic.
7784040	7787923	But I can I can already see next next week's email.
7787923	7788963	I already played Tunic.
7788963	7792966	Now what do I do?
7792966	7797909	Like I've already been to heaven and after five minutes, I was like, let's go.
7797909	7800291	You could also do you know how I make decisions on a lot of games?
7801437	7816535	I watch my friends play them on Twitch television or YouTube or wherever you know they happen to be streaming and stuff because I find that like watching real people play the games and get those impressions oftentimes helps me understand the game a lot better than a
7817436	7821957	Selectively targeted kind of advertisement trailers.
7821957	7827959	We all know have a bunch of pre-rendered stuff in it, you know, or even the review stuff is sometimes very limited to craft a certain narrative.
7827959	7834141	So I like just watching a clip of somebody playing the real deal, you know, and that's how I inform a lot of my decisions.
7834141	7841403	So Red Entertainment, if you're looking for something to play, what are your what are the cool people on Twitch playing right now that you like to follow?
7841403	7842343	That might be another one.
7842343	7843443	And this goes for anybody.
7843443	7846204	I keep picking on Red Entertainment because the email, but they don't play Pizza Tower.
7847885	7860251	Pizza Tower is basically a spiritual successor to WarioWoods, but it's not.
7860251	7862752	It's just that the gameplay is similar to a Wario game.
7870723	7876966	I forgot that Alan Wake is coming out next week in DBD, the new Survivor.
7876966	7883268	I haven't played DBD since... And all the nerfs!
7883268	7885749	I'm playing killer tonight, so we'll see what happens.
7885749	7887630	We'll see how it goes.
7887630	7890671	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
7895337	7896538	Not really.
7896538	7902441	I mean, I saw there's like one of the things talking about the layoffs at Microsoft.
7902441	7912306	We're talking about that their console division, that the folks responsible for bringing more physical releases out into the retail space have been laid off.
7912306	7914867	So I don't know if that necessarily means anything.
7915327	7915747	Right.
7915747	7922453	I know it does, because we had a story last week about Walmart pulling back on the Xbox physical releases.
7922453	7927156	And I wonder if there isn't something to that, which is, again, a sad like physical.
7927156	7938606	Yeah, like a lot of like even when I go down the aisles like for video games and stuff like that nowadays, I go every week at the Target and yeah, it is looking pretty pathetic.
7938606	7940047	But it's it's not like it's
7941601	7942021	Game Pass.
7967165	7988983	I mean, yeah, they want you on Game Pass, but it's not like one of those things where you're going to lose your purchases going to the next platform, like, you know, say with Nintendo and like the Switch, for example, like even with the PlayStation 5, you still have access to your PlayStation 4 games and maybe 3 if those are compatible or whatever.
7988983	7992146	But yeah, I could see like people being certainly comfortable with digital games.
7992146	7993707	I know I am on PC.
7993707	7995589	I mean, I remember back in the day, I was like, oh,
7996400	7997060	No way.
7997060	8000542	Yeah, I got over that really fast.
8000542	8002063	But it's a little different, though.
8002063	8004664	Like, I'm not worried about those libraries going away.
8004664	8015389	And that stuff, once again, as you go along and get new hardware or get a new PC or whatever the case may be, you're still going to have that library that follows with you.
8015389	8024733	And for the most part, those should all still play very well on your new hardware, assuming that the game is not super duper old, in which
8025393	8030759	You know, and even then, like, there's some workarounds for that, but I don't know.
8030759	8040231	I know we have that whole article or the whole thing about Ubisoft saying that, like, people need to start getting used to not owning their games or whatever the case may be.
8040231	8042273	I think that was, like, sort of taken out of context.
8042273	8044235	Attacked, by the way.
8044235	8044536	Yeah.
8046536	8058249	but it like I don't know necessarily that people are not used to owning their games but like in the sense that I think they're saying not owning physical media or something like that.
8058249	8059090	I don't know.
8059090	8059911	We'll see what happens.
8059911	8062253	I mean, the companies are gonna do what they want to do.
8062253	8063495	We just either support it or don't.
8069233	8078719	Questbuster says if you don't like POW World but like another survival sim with fantasy trappings, Enshrouded just came out and is apparently very good.
8095109	8100532	It's probably like first week sale and then it goes up to $29.99, which ironically is the same price of PowerWorld.
8100532	8104194	Yeah, it's going up in a couple of days.
8104194	8105034	SGO 100.
8105034	8108056	Matt reminds us Tekken 8 also came out this week.
8108056	8109877	Crazy amount of games.
8109877	8110557	$70 game, that one.
8110557	8111418	Art named PowerWorld.
8112358	8116860	E3VL reminds me of one I wanted to still check out too, but it also kind of has a high price tag.
8116860	8121641	Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown, which is like that Prince of Persia, Metroidvania type of game.
8121641	8123322	I really wanted to check that game out.
8123322	8123842	Fail.
8123842	8125283	Just wait for a fail for that one.
8125283	8128144	I'm kind of thinking the Ubisoft games tend to end up on Game Pass.
8128144	8129484	So I'm probably just kind of waiting for that.
8129484	8132525	But yeah, I'd like to check that game out at some point for sure.
8132525	8137107	Especially since, you know, they don't like you owning your game.
8137107	8140948	So, you know, pay them less money if possible.
8142011	8148493	All right, well, with all that, it's about time to wrap up tonight's show and head on out for next week.
8148493	8151594	So I want to thank everybody here at the end of show for listening to the show.
8151594	8155635	If you enjoyed what you heard here, whether it was live or on the podcast feed, help us spread the word.
8155635	8159356	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.
8159356	8160997	So tell a friend or two about the show.
8161677	8169982	A nice 5-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way in helping to get the word out about this show.
8169982	8177467	By the way, speaking of iTunes, very random sort of aside, but this discussion came up on Discord and I did have to sign in and agree to it.
8177467	8185612	Apparently, based on what I'm agreeing to, Apple's going to start offering transcriptions of the show, basically live, like as you listen.
8186112	8188554	DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8206127	8213312	Assumably is coming soon based on the fact that I just agreed to the fact that if we put a thing in the store, we're having it transcribed.
8213312	8217895	So, um, but you know, people have been asking for that for a long time.
8217895	8221157	Um, it was, it was expensive to do.
8221157	8226481	Like we looked into it and it was too, unfortunately, as you all know, we really don't make a lot of money off this.
8226481	8228762	You all are very kind with your bits and your subs.
8228762	8229763	We do appreciate it.
8229763	8232345	That helps keep VOG Network a legitimate business.
8232885	8236306	and helps us do the occasional promo at a convention or something like that.
8236306	8239988	But pretty much all of that goes right into the cost of running a business.
8239988	8244329	We don't like get to spend it on fun stuff.
8244329	8248531	So, yeah, just, you know, that's cool.
8248531	8252372	The transcription is coming and will help more people discover the show.
8252372	8258774	All right, DarkSakura, we'll go ahead and say bye bye to you as I know you've got your stream you're going to do and all that stuff.
8258774	8260915	Any final words or final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8262389	8274713	I just still want to encourage everybody to fact check anything that you read on your social media and bring them home.
8274713	8276213	All right.
8276213	8276994	Have a good night, DarkSakura.
8276994	8277894	Have a good stream.
8277894	8278194	Bye.
8278194	8280075	You too.
8280075	8283216	Loki, that takes us to you and your final thought tonight.
8283216	8287237	My final thought is I got to spend the week editing and then designing.
8288186	8289187	Good times.
8289187	8290027	Never ends.
8290027	8291909	Never ends.
8291909	8297113	My final thought is I have like three more weeks until my cruise and I am maybe four.
8297113	8299394	I lost count, but I'm really excited.
8299394	8300335	That's all I have to say.
8300335	8301156	It's getting closer.
8301156	8302276	It's less than 30 days away.
8302276	8306880	And I'm really fucking excited because I don't think we're going to go in 2025.
8306880	8311243	So this is going to be the last one for a little bit so that we can travel to other places, too.
8311243	8311843	I really want to.
8311843	8314906	I still want to go to Europe and see the Abba show one of these days.
8315586	8316126	One of these days.
8316126	8318028	Anyway, have a great week, everybody.
8318028	8321591	We'll see you next time in seven days to do it all over again.

8325974	8328616	We just appreciate you being here and supporting us.
8328616	8333240	We'll be back next week to do it all again as we inch closer and closer to Episode 1000.
8333240	8337123	And people keep asking, do you have anything special planned for Episode 1000?
8337123	8339404	And my answer is no.
8342526	8351293	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
