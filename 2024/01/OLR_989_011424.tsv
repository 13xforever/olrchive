10040	13523	Sony and Honda want to gamify your commute.
13523	20408	Gamifying driving is probably an impossible task because any address this crisis or need scenario introduces an unsafe thought into people.
20408	23891	Because even commuting itself introduces unsafe thoughts into people.
23891	28575	The best game in a two-ton death machine is the one they're playing IRL and safety isn't able to be gamed.
28575	30977	This is the New Year layoff deja vu avoiding intro.
30977	35941	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Somerson, Loki to tell you more about these and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35941	38523	Starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has a voice.
40097	48142	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48142	61011	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 989 of our show for tonight, January the 14th of 2024.
61011	66415	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here in the studio each and every week with my co-hosts.
66415	70057	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Somers.
72839	76322	Hello, hello, how are you?
76322	79225	My eyes are having a very bad allergy attack.
79225	81727	Oh no, that's no fun.
81727	85510	I might have to go take some more Sudafed, even though the rest of me feels fine.
85510	88552	I even got my steroid cream out.
88552	92055	I'd say fun, but that doesn't sound like any fun at all, actually.
92055	94077	I know the weather's been wild across the country.
95669	100412	Yeah, it's it's California cold here this week, which is, you know, that's that's very cold for us.
100412	105275	But for the rest of the nation, for the most part, it's it's oh, my God, fucking freezing.
105275	105816	No, thank you.
105816	108017	That's why I don't live there type weather.
108017	113421	We were we were certainly a lot colder earlier this week, though, than we are now.
113421	114362	That's true.
114362	118344	And to answer PodCulture's question about that's what, 60?
118344	121326	It's 52 here.
121326	124748	But sometimes when I would go into work, it would still be in the low 30s.
125849	133632	So that's really cold for Northern California and not in the like mountainous area.
133632	138193	We're in a valley, so this place actually traps heat like a pocket.
138193	141854	That's why I call this the convection oven of California.
141854	146616	But apart from, you know, Satan's parched asshole.
146616	148657	That's the summer.
148657	149917	Yeah, that's the summer.
149917	151217	And also that's Fresno.
151217	151698	Let's be clear.
154793	155313	I don't know.
155313	157636	I thought Fresno would be something a little bit more desolate.
157636	167246	But yeah, for those who are in Kolja Climes, please be careful.
167246	170951	Take care of yourself and check in with us every so often so that we know you're not dead.
171451	174512	It's right a good place to check in with us would be our discord.
174512	177614	You can join our discord server over at vognetwork.com.
177614	185597	That's VOGnetwork.com slash discord, where we do chat throughout the week we share some stories about what's going on in gaming and sometimes convention updates too.
185597	188518	I'll talk about kind of one of those going on right now in just a moment.
188518	191760	But first, I want to also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
191760	192880	Hey, Loki.
192880	193380	Hello.
193380	194121	Hi, how are you doing?
194841	195741	I'm doing pretty good.
195741	206487	Okay, so when we do tape live, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
206487	208508	He wasn't on tonight though, and I'll come back to that in a minute.
208508	214971	But when we are live, you you have little videos playing in the background so we don't see your kitchen.
214971	219373	We see whatever game of the week you have picked instead.
219373	220733	I don't know if I recognize this one.
220733	222954	Is this like the Toy Story video game annotation?
222954	223275	Can't be.
223275	224195	That's not the character from Toy Story.
224355	228316	No, it's Clockwork Knight from the Saturn.
228316	229817	Didn't Alan educate you?
241658	243961	I mean, keep in mind, we didn't get together till much later.
243961	248105	And yeah, I learned, but I was I was not really gaming when the Saturn first came out.
248105	251249	I took a little break from gaming during college.
251249	256155	Maybe like I had a PlayStation and I went pretty hard on like other entertainment.
256155	261180	Yeah, but I didn't I didn't kind of use other entertainment.
261180	262362	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
262842	270691	So, but I appreciate it now, but I don't have the deep knowledge or fondness of the games that many other people do, but I appreciate it now.
270691	273574	A lot of Sega stuff was just really ahead of its time.
273574	276397	It really was, especially Dreamcast, right?
276397	277618	I think everybody agrees on that.
277618	282163	The Dreamcast is just like, you know, was just a little ahead of its time.
282163	282263	So.
283365	286627	Anyway, and it did some really stupid stuff too.
286627	287967	Yeah, that's true.
287967	292289	Um, I did mention that we tape every week after the Bobby Blackwell show, but he's not here tonight.
292289	297291	That is because if you've been paying attention over the last few weeks, he's at Awesome Games Done Quick.
297291	298432	He flew out yesterday.
298852	303258	And so the Games Done Quick marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation started today.
303258	306543	I think he flew out there yesterday, so it started today.
306543	311049	And he will be hosting some various games on I think Thursday night and the last day.
311049	314154	But we actually have a little bit of late breaking news because
314514	319075	I mean, and it's unfortunate because of the travel issues going on around the country.
319075	321176	It sounds like another, I think, that's the reason.
321176	322196	That's what I'm going to blame anyway.
322196	325417	Whether it's the reason or not, that's what I'm going to blame.
325417	329538	The other host that was supposed to be there tonight isn't going to be able to make it.
329538	333599	So Bobby is actually going to be doing some stuff tonight at 2 a.m.
333599	335820	Eastern, which will be 11 o'clock Pacific.
336460	341187	So that's 11 o'clock our time, which isn't as bad, but especially because many people have a holiday.
341187	342088	I have a holiday tomorrow.
342088	344952	I know many people do, but I know a lot of people don't as well.
344952	346554	I hope he's taking a nap.
346554	348276	Oh, that's why he's not here right now.
348276	349838	He said he's taking a nap before his shift.
351892	353934	Great minds think like us.
371545	378047	Fun sometimes to get the behind-the-scenes perspective from, you know, people that, you know, are involved with it.
378047	386709	And I know when they did TwitchCon, it was really cool to see the mini festival they did at TwitchCon because it was almost like being at the real event, from what I understand.
386709	395671	But anyway, what I really wanted to say is one of the games that he's ending up hosting tonight is one that I think I would have watched anyway, and it's The Typing of the Dead.
395671	398992	Speaking of wonderful Sega games ahead of their time,
401055	406056	The Typing of the Dead is one of the speedruns that he will be reading donations during tonight.
406056	409637	And that was a surprise edition, which is unfortunate for somebody else.
409637	415278	And I hope everybody that is trying to get to Games Done Quick is being safe and traveling A-OK.
415278	420219	But I know Bobby will step in at the last minute and do a fantastic job.
420219	421079	So check that out.
421079	423460	And he'll be back live next week if you do want to see video.
429486	435912	Let's get into our show tonight.
435912	442058	So usually we start off the show with like a kickoff topic, a headline here to start things off.
442058	446583	Tonight, we're gonna do it just a little bit different because at the end of last week's show,
447183	463076	We took a look back at our 2023 predictions and it turns out we were wrong on most of them But we did there was I think we had one and a half points from things that we did call That would happen this next year and predictions are fun.
463076	464017	They're a little silly.
464017	469221	They're light-hearted It's not meant to be taken super seriously, but I'm gonna try to make some serious predictions tonight and
469361	471163	If you have anything you want to add,
485818	494261	Please go ahead and put it in the chat because if we decide one of yours is better than one of ours, we've been known to steal from chat and give you credit for that.
494261	499842	And also, I will just say, I'll open this up to emails and people that listen on the podcast feed throughout the week.
499842	504484	If you want to email us, I'd love to read some good predictions next week on the show.
504904	507665	But for now, let's go around the room and check out.
507665	515008	We're going to put on our thinking caps and get our tarot decks and our future predicting Ouija boards.
515008	516548	We're going to contact the dead.
516548	524511	We're going to light some candles and we are going to figure out what is going to happen this year in gaming with our 2024 gaming predictions.
524511	525392	What's that, Jamie?
525392	530454	I have the lady from Mallrats with her fake third nipple.
530454	533315	I have the alien from Total Recall with her real third nipple.
535632	536032	Okay.
536032	539293	Now, don't you remember the Psychic and the Good Mole?
539293	539933	Oh, yeah, I do.
539933	540253	100% I do.
540253	542254	Yeah, yeah.
542254	546475	You know, Shannon Doherty blames that movie for ruining her career, by the way.
546475	548836	But that's a whole other... It's like, you should be... Anyway.
548836	554577	I'm sorry, she was in a Kevin Smith movie, so that should have boosted her.
554577	556137	If she failed, it's her own damn fault.
556137	561559	It's weird that all the other careers of those people were just fine, but hers in particular...
562509	565831	I'm hoping that's just a clickbait headline I fell for.
565831	567312	Yeah, I mean, what has he done?
567312	572436	Like, that guy just, like, faded into obscurity.
572436	573557	Like, I don't know.
573557	573877	All right.
573877	574237	Hello.
574237	574437	Hello.
574437	576219	We're not talking about 1998 anymore.
576219	578260	Let's look at 2024.
578260	580001	Here we go.
580001	580682	Our 2024 predictions.
580682	582183	Who's feeling brave and wants to go first?
582183	582963	Loki is.
582963	583544	Sure.
583544	585265	I'll go first.
585265	588407	Literally, DarkSakura volunteered.
588407	590188	DarkSakura, go ahead.
590188	590789	Go first.
591869	596051	Well, it's stupid, but Paprium will get a release date for Steam.
596051	598171	Wha- I'm sorry, what game?
598171	598952	Paprium.
598952	600132	Paprium.
600132	602613	I don't, uh- There's a lot of drama about this.
602613	613777	It was this massive brawler that had this huge-ass Kickstarter, uh, for, um, for the Mega Drive or Genesis, and the game was fraught with issues.
613777	620300	And they made, like, there's another Kickstarter out there to get it on Steam, um, but,
621561	628229	I am predicting a playable version to be released this year.
628229	629370	I'm going to throw it out there.
629370	632414	I hope so, because I really want to play Paprium.
633649	638351	I don't want to pay, you know, $120 to buy the cartridge, but I want to play Paprium.
638351	638791	Okay.
638791	639051	Okay.
639051	639652	I get it now.
639652	640212	I do.
640212	642273	Now that you said it was like the Genesis Kickstarter.
642273	642513	Yeah.
642513	642773	Yeah.
642773	642973	Yeah.
642973	643213	Yeah.
643213	644333	I'm pretty sure I did hear about this.
644333	644634	Okay.
644634	645514	I'm with you.
645514	647115	Okay.
647115	648915	So Loki, that brings us to you then.
648915	649556	Now you can go.
649556	651156	What is your number three prediction?
651156	655938	Oh, we're going to start it off on a high note here.
655938	662121	Bobby Kotick becomes the CEO of another game industry slash game industry adjacent company.
662745	664307	I hope you're wrong.
664307	669555	I hope you're wrong too, but I'm gonna look sometimes with these predictions.
669555	672019	It's not that we want them to come true.
672019	673541	We just sing it.
673541	676666	The cynics cynics in us say it will so Oh,
678374	680035	Uh, so I'm trying to think how to write this here.
680035	682436	Gaming adjacent company.
682436	684438	And what, what are your reasons for that?
684438	690181	Are you saying that because this is one of those things where it's like assholes are never held accountable?
690181	690681	That kind of thing?
690681	696324	It's because people like him just don't fade away into obscurity.
696324	699086	They always come back into like other roles.
699086	703989	Like I could see like Unity going, Hey, we need another CEO.
703989	706210	Let's bring him on in, you know, like, cause
706950	716342	uh loki brave enough to even say what company he thinks it'll be all right so i don't know we'll see it's hopefully he just goes away but
717441	717901	All right.
717901	721244	I have other things I wish you would do, but yeah, that's neither here nor there.
721244	721964	All right.
721964	724005	DarkTutsuya says insert Darth Vader.
724005	725026	No here.
725026	727007	Yeah, that isn't appropriate.
727007	736393	That TigerClaw thinks TigerClaw is literally going to double down and says John Riccatello will also probably be the CEO of some other company.
736393	737794	He's going to run into the ground.
737794	743878	I mean, that actually Loki, that may be what I say about that.
743878	744779	You know what I say about that?
744779	744939	Hmm.
746397	748021	Die, monster!
748021	749705	You don't belong in this world!
750788	754510	Oh no, not you getting fucking soundboard access.
754510	755391	All right.
755391	758272	Uh, I made it myself.
758272	759373	Moving on.
759373	760814	Uh, let's get to my number three.
760814	761634	Okay.
761634	765376	Um, this one is also a little bit of a safe bet for me.
765376	773821	I'm admittedly, this is a safe bet for me because we're going to have a story later where some of this is already happening, but I'm going to take it a little bit of a step further.
773821	779124	And I'm going to say that two launch titles for the switch successor.
779124	779144	I,
779864	783785	For me to predict the Switch successor is happening this year, that is way too safe of a prediction.
783785	785166	Of course it's happening this year.
785166	792008	But I'm going to predict that two LaunchWidow titles for the Switch successor are Microsoft games.
792008	797550	And because that may be a little too safe, I'm actually going to say one of them is Sea of Thieves.
797550	803152	And I think the other one will be the Diablo 4 plus its expansion that will come out later this year.
803152	805693	I think that will come out around the same time as the Switch successor.
805693	809214	And I think that will also be, because technically now Microsoft owns all those titles,
810074	814799	I think Overwatch 2 would be an extremely safe pick as well.
814799	826829	So really, I could see this being three launch window titles for Switch successor, but I really do think one of them will be outside the Activision Blizzard bubble, and that's why I'm saying Sea of Thieves in particular.
826829	835817	I think, in particular, the co-opness of Sea of Thieves that Microsoft really wants to push, I think that might...
836806	846069	I don't know how to say this tactfully, I think that plays better in Nintendo's ecosystem versus what has historically been Microsoft's ecosystem.
846069	848390	And I'll just let y'all chew on what I mean by that.
848390	858334	And that's not to say there aren't people enjoying and thriving in Sea of Thieves in the Microsoft ecosystem now, but I think Microsoft is going to see that if they really want to grow that, the Nintendo audience is who they want to tap into.
859372	867122	And yes, Chad is naming a game that we're going to get to later that technically is potentially already releasing for this generation of Switch.
867122	870946	I'm going to talk about Microsoft's continued support for the Switch successor.
871872	875035	All right, so let's get into the number two.
875035	876517	I mean, I don't know why we order these.
876517	877638	They're all really the same.
877638	878058	Oops, sorry.
878058	881361	That's that's me playing in WordPad if you hear that little ding.
881361	886686	So let's get into the number two predictions or the poopy predictions.
886686	891391	DarkSakura, what's your number two prediction?
891391	894274	E3 announces yet another metamorphosis just when we thought they were done.
896006	897747	Oh, dark.
897747	900090	Would you would you based on the clip you just played?
900090	903713	Would that be dark metamorphosis?
903713	905615	Um, maybe?
905615	908178	Maybe?
908178	908779	Okay, yeah.
908779	913784	Okay, so E3 announces so they're not so E3 isn't really dead.
913784	916406	They go through a dark metamorphosis.
916406	916566	And
918399	921401	Somebody buys the E3 name or something like that.
921401	922462	Okay, I could go with that.
922462	923322	I could go with that.
923322	925343	Just what you thought it was safe to be rid of E3.
925343	927144	Okay.
927144	930026	Loki, what's your number two pick?
930026	933248	I had the Switch successor would be announced by March.
933248	939332	It's coming out next year and launches with Metroid Prime 4 and Mario Odyssey 2.
939332	940753	Wow.
940753	942414	Wait, did you say next year though?
942414	944895	Do you mean 2025 or do you mean later this year? 2025.
946277	948558	Wow, okay.
948558	950859	That's the that's the part of your prediction.
950859	952020	I don't think you got right.
952020	955022	But I maybe that's that's why we do this.
955022	956282	That's why we do this.
956282	957543	All right.
957543	958724	Interesting.
958724	959964	Um, okay.
959964	961845	Why do you think it's all the way in 2025?
961845	965387	Why do you think they missed this year after all the hype for this year?
965387	966848	It's really just over time.
966848	968369	I think they need more time.
970219	987220	And actually, you know, now that I think about it, though, a 2025 release would not mean a March announcement, because that would kill sales for the rest of the year, unless they're doing something like, we're going to keep both SKUs around type of stuff, you know, DS Lite, DS type thing.
990413	990793	I think
1007426	1012167	were coded with another Switch in mind that never released.
1012167	1018889	And I really think those games are going to play a lot better on the Switch successor.
1018889	1023551	Maybe that should be one of my predictions, but in my gut, I feel like that's true with those.
1025511	1026653	Do you feel it in your bones?
1040086	1055654	I believe at the end of the year, so in the last, in the holiday rush, a game, a AAA game in the holiday rush is going to get targeted, dragged, and exposed because of its overuse of AI.
1055654	1060757	So in other words, a game that tries to pass itself off as not having a lot of this in it,
1061437	1087504	people on the inside are going to uh report undercover or it's going to come out in the review process that there is a overuse of AI there's a lot of AI that's in this in the AI-generated AI-generated AI-generated quest AI-generated voice acting and AI-generated assets are going to show up in the game and this game gets universally dragged by social media and I'm talking a shlacking of like um
1088504	1093769	What was the Square Enix game that just shit the bed when it came out by the Sega guy?
1093769	1096412	Was it the... By Sonic?
1096412	1097213	Yeah, I know which one.
1097213	1099335	The one that reused the 14 assets?
1099335	1100576	That one?
1100576	1102898	That's a good example too.
1102898	1106642	That and the cutesy cartoon game that nobody liked.
1107623	1108564	Balan Wonderland.
1108564	1109445	Thank you, DarkSakura.
1109445	1111488	That's what I'm trying to think about.
1111488	1118576	I'm talking, it gets its ass kicked on social media in that regard, and the game absolutely tanks and puts the company in danger.
1118576	1124623	Now, because I think this is a safe pick, I'm going to go so far as to say Ubisoft is the culprit.
1124623	1127846	And I'm leaning into that because we know that they've been developing
1128667	1151202	technology for AI quest generated things and I think this games as a service stuff, I think somebody tries to lean in and use AI for this games as a service and their pants get pulled all the way off and their butt and balls are completely exposed to the entire gaming world and nobody buys this game as a result.
1151202	1154104	Alright, isn't that a safe pick?
1154104	1156045	I hate it, but it's a safe pick, don't you think?
1156676	1158497	Me, yeah, it's pretty safe.
1158497	1169081	I was also just thinking though, I don't have a problem with like, like fetch quest stuff being randomly generated by AI, but definitely the use of art assets and music and voice acting.
1169081	1175783	Yeah, I would say what you're describing is like what Skyrim did to generate the daily quest.
1175783	1178064	And I think most people are like, okay with that.
1178064	1181825	But I'm gonna, I'm gonna say it goes one step further than that.
1181825	1183426	Actually 10 steps further than that.
1183426	1183646	Okay.
1184526	1191413	Number one, numero uno, the top prediction, although these really aren't ranked, but we're going to pretend they are anyway.
1191413	1193235	DarkSakura.
1193235	1207929	Well, this one's actually a safe one, but just from experiences of my own recently that I actually can't talk about, I'm going to say an even bigger push on VR and spatial computing in and outside of the gaming industry.
1211889	1215391	a bigger push in VR in and outside the gaming industry.
1215391	1219453	And spatial computing, as in spatial environments for computing.
1219453	1221354	Oh, okay, okay.
1221354	1224415	We're already seeing a big push with spatial audio.
1224415	1225796	That's been a lot more.
1225796	1226196	Yes.
1226196	1233840	We already have spatial computing with some of the recently announced products coming out.
1233840	1236842	I mean, Oculus is still a thing.
1236842	1240684	But we are now getting into that VR environment
1241344	1248370	in the world of consumer computing.
1248370	1255056	I think that there's going to be an even bigger boom in that.
1255056	1262242	And because we've got an announcement date after the Vision Pro is released, I think we're going to see a lot of people trying to follow suit.
1262242	1262402	Yeah.
1263663	1264884	I get that.
1264884	1271806	And even in the gaming space, I look at something like Niantic, because I play a lot of Niantic games.
1271806	1277407	Pokemon Go obviously being the most common, but of course, Monster Hunter now, Pikmin, Ingress, these are all things.
1277407	1282429	And Ingress is usually kind of the canary in the coal mine for a lot of Niantic stuff.
1282429	1287451	And they've gotten really big into scanning, which again is AR, not VR, but it's still
1288991	1290732	Spatial Augmented Reality.
1290732	1291372	Yeah, exactly.
1291372	1292513	It's still for those who don't know.
1292513	1294234	Yeah, it's still very spatial.
1294234	1299016	So what you can do is you scan these 3D portals and now you do hacking in 3D around the landmark.
1299016	1302758	Basically, it's called overclocking in the games mechanic.
1302758	1316625	I think this is not an official prediction of mine, but I do think kind of along these lines, you're going to see something in Pokemon Go this year that utilizes that because and my thought was mass outbreaks would be a feature that they're going to bring is that you start to scan
1317125	1321346	the I keep calling them portals because they are in Ingress, but you scan the landmark.
1321346	1330310	And what will happen is that for like 60 seconds, you're going to see Pokemon just like pop out behind the sculpture, walk out from around the sculpture.
1330310	1337552	Yes, but like like in the 3D environment with your phone, you'll actually see them pop out because they kind of have this in AR now.
1337552	1341193	But what they don't do is they don't actually interact with the landmarks.
1341193	1344614	But behind the scenes, they've been collecting scans of all the landmarks.
1344614	1345955	If you play Pokemon Go, you scan landmarks.
1346455	1351097	Which is actually really easy for iOS with the virtual reality kit.
1351097	1351758	It is.
1351758	1362082	And I think with, you know, I think the Apple Vision thing is going to be a great way for them to enact this type of thing in Pokemon Go potentially.
1362082	1363203	So we'll see.
1363203	1363663	We'll see.
1363663	1368885	I just, you know, it's one of those crazy predictions where I was like, I wonder how they would utilize this feature in Pokemon Go.
1368885	1371987	And I think I could see like 60 seconds of Pikachus everywhere.
1373464	1384074	I disagree with it being for games like Pokemon Go, but I could see it for other games that would involve staying in the house.
1384074	1384594	Okay.
1384594	1385315	Hmm.
1385315	1386756	Okay.
1386756	1388078	All right.
1388078	1388838	All right.
1388838	1391481	Well, let's go to Loki, your numero uno prediction.
1392210	1405118	You don't really have a really big number one prediction, but, um, I'm waiting to make the prediction that the, well, obviously by the time, cause it's not coming out until next March, March or April, I think.
1405118	1410481	Um, but the, the Minecraft movie trailer will come out and it will suck really bad.
1410481	1418446	I will still go see it though in 2025, but that's my prediction is that the, the movie trailer for the Minecraft movie is going to be awful.
1420939	1422759	It just sounds awful.
1422759	1425100	That is the safest prediction on this entire list.
1425100	1429641	And we've had a lot of safe predictions tonight.
1429641	1432762	I don't want it to be awful, but it it's gonna be awful.
1432762	1434182	Here's this live action.
1434182	1438423	It's just gonna be it's gonna be awful.
1438423	1439964	I feel.
1439964	1441104	All right.
1441104	1443264	Um, and my number one you want to talk about?
1443264	1445565	I don't know if this maybe isn't a safe pick.
1447637	1450740	I'm going to say this and I'm going to explain why.
1450740	1454664	Because you're going to think this isn't a big deal, but when I explain the why, I think you'll understand.
1454664	1455725	So here it is.
1455725	1462971	My number one prediction is the Game of the Year at Dorito Pope's 2024 Game Awards is an indie game.
1463888	1465209	It's not going to be a AAA game.
1465209	1467109	It's going to be an indie game.
1467109	1471451	And the reason why I'm saying that is that, you know, we're going to get into this in a little bit here.
1471451	1476854	We get into the news of this week, but there's obviously, there's been a lot of layoffs in the industry, in the tech industry.
1476854	1479875	We've, we've heard a lot about this and it's, it's really unfortunate.
1479875	1482917	And this is a theme that's been continuing from 2023.
1482917	1492001	And for such a bright year as 2023 was in gaming, it just sucks that the industry has not been able to
1493161	1498045	stay on top of itself in a business sense that you know, it's been poorly managed.
1498045	1502888	The product has been great across mostly mostly across the board, except for that Kong game.
1502888	1507031	But even the Kong game was bad because it was poorly managed.
1507031	1511074	And I think that, you know, unfortunately, you're seeing a lot of these layoffs.
1511074	1517658	But the interesting thing about the gaming industry is that unlike a lot of industries, if you
1518666	1530455	get laid off or you leave the gaming industry, and you have the means and resources, which isn't available for everybody, but you have the means and resources to sustain yourself for a little while, you can make your own game.
1531405	1542115	And I think what and you can make your own product and ultimately it's very easy to put your own product out there on Steam, you know, an epic store a variety of different places, y'all know the game stores out there.
1542115	1553346	And I think what happens is that some of these people that were laid off in 2023, band together, make an indie studio, and they make the fucking next Minecraft, the next
1554929	1559592	Five Nights at Freddy's, the next, you know, you name it, huge indie title.
1559592	1569800	And I think you get a swell of support, not just because the game is good, but because people kind of want to stick it to the man this year.
1569800	1578146	And they're going to award an indie game that I think the story will be that these folks that got laid off came together to create an even better game.
1578146	1582369	And that's, that's what ultimately wins the 2024 Game of the Year award.
1582369	1582509	So.
1583900	1588424	There's somewhat of that playing into my AI prediction as well.
1588424	1602915	I think there's going to be a lot of pushback from people against these fat cats that still, in the management, they're still working at these companies that cut all the people making the meaningful work out of it.
1602915	1606938	I think there's going to be a lot of people that want to see them fail, and I don't blame them.
1606938	1610521	And so I think that's why you're going to see exposure with AAA games and so forth.
1611061	1613684	And you know, Tigerclaw brings up a great point.
1613684	1619852	If Baldur's Gate 3 is any indication, 2024 will have a huge indie game that's going to win many awards.
1619852	1622075	You know, I'm not sure where we draw- It's probably an indie game.
1622075	1627121	Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm not sure where we draw the line with indie, but, like, it kinda, yeah, like...
1628180	1633042	A lot of the reason why Baldur's Gate 3 was so well received is a lot of that.
1633042	1640545	You know, it's the whole pushing back against DLC and releasing a product that's actually worth the $70 that you pay for and all that.
1640545	1643966	That's why that game got embraced in many of the ways that it has.
1643966	1648248	Except it has gotten updates and new content.
1648248	1648568	Yes.
1648568	1650489	And for free.
1650489	1651649	So, which is great.
1651649	1654451	But it still doesn't mean that it's not DLC, you know?
1654451	1654931	Sure, sure.
1656443	1663589	Um, but I, I think, um, the game of the year 2024 will be a little bit more on the cheaper end than Baldur's Gate 3, but we'll see.
1663589	1664490	We'll see.
1664490	1665751	That's, those are my thoughts.
1665751	1667752	So anyway, um, let's recap.
1667752	1670995	I'm going to show you the lovely WordPad file that I'm about to save here.
1670995	1673937	We're going to recap my very professional notes here.
1673937	1675178	Our predictions.
1675178	1678861	So Paprium, uh, releases on Steam.
1678861	1682604	Bobby Kotick becomes the CEO of another gaming or gaming adjacent company.
1684093	1690295	Two launch window titles for the Switch successor are Microsoft games, and one of them is Sea of Thieves.
1690295	1693876	E3 announces another metamorphosis.
1693876	1696356	A dark metamorphosis.
1696356	1703038	The Switch successor is announced by March, and Prime 4 and Odyssey are launch titles, and it releases 2025.
1703038	1710900	A AAA game gets exposed for way overuse of AI, and it causes the game to absolutely tank.
1712017	1724392	a bigger push in VR and spatial environments in and outside the gaming industry, the Minecraft movie trailer sucks, and the Game of the Year 2024 at the Game Awards is an indie game.
1724392	1725994	There you have it.
1725994	1727676	How do you think we're going to score, y'all?
1728499	1729360	I asked that in our chat room.
1729360	1731101	I think these are actually pretty safe predictions.
1731101	1739586	I mean, I don't think Paprium's gonna happen, but... This is, like, honestly, this is probably, like, the safest prediction year I've ever seen us do.
1739586	1740226	But we'll see.
1740226	1742047	I mean, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
1742047	1748151	Maybe after getting bruised a little bit, after only getting... Okay, leave me... Sorry, it's bugging me here.
1748151	1757337	Okay, maybe after getting bruised a little bit with only getting one and a half right last year, we're dialing it back a little bit with some more safe and less big predictions.
1757904	1758264	I don't know
1771548	1788608	We're looking at an industry now that we've had our toes dipped into for, you know, decades now and looking at the ebb and flow, paying attention to the world around it and making some pretty solid fact based predictions.
1789088	1804378	You know, I think that's a damn good point, you know, and I think I hesitate to call these cynical predictions, but they live in that world of like, realism of like being around like, for example, the Bobby Kotick thing, that prediction sucks.
1804378	1809201	But it comes from that place of we've we have seen shitty people succeed too many times.
1810021	1816262	As the saying goes, you know, a cynic is what an optimist calls a realist.
1816262	1825604	And I would say my AI pick, and ultimately what drove me to say the indie game for 2024, I would say those picks of mine are rooted in that a little bit as well.
1825604	1833385	They're not just something that, you know, we shat out one day and decided that they were going to be our predictions.
1833385	1834325	I don't know, DarkSakura.
1834325	1837726	I did write these on the toilet earlier today.
1837726	1838746	Did we need to know that, Rob?
1839502	1841548	I'm just kidding, or am I?
1841548	1842831	You know what?
1842831	1844355	I did mine five minutes before the show.
1846385	1856852	But that's the other thing too, is just that I think because we're so versed in the ebb and flow of things, that we, we can.
1856852	1865117	And for the record, Bonds006, I said, VR in general, meta is part of that universe.
1865117	1874883	I didn't focus on that one because I think we're going to get a whole lot of imitators after the Vision Pro gets released, which we only have, you know,
1875842	1880259	a little bit of time before those pre-orders go up as it was already announced.
1880259	1880459	Yeah.
1881795	1887017	I think outside of the, you know, former Oculus realm, I think Meta kind of stays out of gaming.
1887017	1889258	I think, yeah, that's it.
1889258	1891099	You shouldn't have Froth on your PC.
1891099	1892920	Bons006 apologizes.
1892920	1894481	Anyway, no, it's totally fine.
1894481	1896301	It's all good.
1896301	1909227	So, yeah, I'll, you know, if I wanted to do a really safe prediction, I would have brought back tonight's intro bump that we play live before the show, and I would have said Atari releases 10 more versions of Yars' Revenge.
1909227	1910748	That would have also been a safe pick.
1912028	1915590	Hey, you know what?
1915590	1920613	I have a safe prediction and that's that Midnight can't stop throwing up all over the house.
1920613	1921514	That's a safe prediction.
1921514	1922154	Wait, hold on.
1922154	1923215	Hold on.
1923215	1926537	Buy me 30 seconds because on the Yars Revenge note, I have something to share.
1926537	1928238	Buy me 30 seconds.
1928238	1929979	Buy you 30 seconds with what?
1929979	1930939	I don't have any money.
1930939	1932440	I can't buy time.
1932440	1934181	Do I look like a demigod?
1934181	1936402	Well, I mean, maybe I kind of do.
1936402	1937423	I can't do that.
1937423	1938544	I don't have that ability.
1938544	1938944	Matt, do you?
1939907	1939987	and
1965772	1966573	Yars' Revenge
1990606	1993409	So I am not fucking helping.
1993409	1996332	But for the record, this cartridge is actually out of print.
1996332	1997694	And that's part of why I bought it.
1997694	1998775	And I have too much.
1998775	2001478	I also bought Namco 1 and 2.
2001478	2002819	What?
2002819	2003520	Is it not PAL?
2004847	2005588	Ninja Golf
2032205	2034106	No, but keep in mind this is Collection 2.
2034106	2037046	I don't know what was in Collection 1.
2037046	2039227	I could not find Collection 1 anywhere.
2039227	2041647	Ninja Golf is such a weird fucking game.
2041647	2045628	I'm gonna get those Toaplan cartridges at some point, just to make you jealous, DarkSakura.
2045628	2048789	Not really, but I'm gonna pretend it makes you jealous.
2048789	2053870	You mean when I can go grab my Genesis and play Zero Wing?
2053870	2054750	Yes, yeah.
2054750	2056230	Actually, but I will say this.
2056230	2059311	So, let me bring up... You know I have an Ultracade, right?
2061082	2061663	Oh, that's right.
2061663	2063063	You do.
2063063	2064905	I do.
2064905	2068447	I will say I'm going to put this out there because I know we have listeners overseas.
2068447	2068947	And you know what?
2068947	2072009	Sometimes DarkSakura asks the listeners for things she wants.
2072009	2076993	I'm going to put this out because this is the Evercade cartridge I want more than anything.
2076993	2079494	And it's like $90 on eBay.
2079494	2081836	But I know somebody's got to have it out there.
2081836	2082796	It's this one.
2082796	2083657	Okay.
2083657	2085598	This is no longer in print.
2085598	2087359	It's the Pico.
2087359	2089361	It's the Pico Interactive Collection 1.
2090021	2091882	Piko, P-I-K-O.
2091882	2096906	And the games that are in this are fucking obscure-ass games, but they're great.
2096906	2099947	Eight Eyes, which was on the NES, you might remember.
2099947	2102709	Drakken, which I know I've talked about this game before.
2102709	2103930	And Dragon View.
2103930	2108433	This is the fucking gold bar game in this pack, is Dragon View.
2108433	2115197	Yes, I could just bring it up in an emulator if I wanted to, but I think it would be so cool to have a legitimate version of Dragon View.
2115197	2117319	It also has The Immortal from NES.
2117319	2119240	It has a lot of, you know, because, yeah.
2119800	2124565	PowerPunch2, which literally looks like a rip-off of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
2124565	2135716	Exploding Fist, which I vaguely... Top Racer, I vaguely remember a lot of these games from Nintendo and Super Nintendo, but that is like, right now, my holy grail for this system.
2135716	2137358	That's the thing I want more than anything right now.
2139968	2145691	I'll put up one of my searches for you because I have good trackers on that.
2145691	2146531	Awesome.
2146531	2147252	Appreciate it.
2147252	2155556	Yeah, because if I if I could find it, it's because I did pay $30 for the Namco carts, and I think they're usually around $20, but they wanted $90 on eBay for this.
2155556	2157437	I'm like, no, no, no, that's that's too much.
2157437	2163400	So I did find the Data East collection and the Jolly Go collection, Data East and the Interplay collection.
2163720	2170606	Data East, if you buy, well, most of the cartridges are still in print and Data East, by the way, is a pack-in game with the Versus.
2170606	2173409	But if you buy the handheld, the handheld... Gremlin Collection.
2173409	2174249	So, yeah.
2174249	2176371	Oh, there's a ton of great collections on that thing.
2176371	2176772	Anyway.
2176772	2177072	Yeah.
2177072	2178293	But I don't want to sound like a shill.
2178293	2180815	It's just something that I happen to have and I want.
2180815	2183277	Anyway, we're getting into our gaming weeks a little bit.
2183277	2187681	So we should probably turn it over and ask folks, how was your gaming week?
2187681	2190864	So let's go to DarkSakura and ask, how was your gaming week?
2192831	2197155	It was actually a little bit eventful.
2197155	2205223	I, of course, played some Dead by Daylight and had a pretty good time, although I didn't play it for a super long time.
2205223	2207946	I tried again to do Baldur's Gate 3.
2207946	2213712	I turned off my cloud saves and that made zero difference for streaming, so I am relegated to playing it offline.
2215994	2218816	Well, at least not streaming.
2218816	2230086	I also, of course, played Rudra no Hiho, which is Treasure of the Rudras, the last game that Square released for the Super Famicom.
2230086	2234870	And I finished the second scenario, so now I've started on the third scenario.
2234870	2235571	Love that game.
2235571	2237813	It's really fucking good.
2237813	2238753	It needs a re-release.
2240855	2252820	I also played some Jackie Crush, you know, one of those pinball games in the Devil's Crush series, but that was on Super Famicom.
2252820	2268627	I also started, I started Maria's scenario on Nocturne in the Moonlight, which, and I'm talking about like the English translation and everything, but I decided I really wanted- That patch we talked about last week, or like something you just talked about?
2268627	2268807	Yeah.
2268807	2268927	Okay.
2270376	2286019	I mean, I already officially own the game, so I can legally... I actually own this, I own the translation it's based off of, and the voice acting that they included in it, so it's like... I own all the pieces that made this game, I can legally emulate it, okay?
2288020	2293582	So, at any rate, I decided to start the main scenario with Alucard.
2293582	2295123	And the voices, I mean, they are different.
2295123	2296943	They're the ones from the PSP.
2296943	2298144	It's not at all bad.
2298144	2300605	The dialogue makes more sense.
2300605	2309528	And it's gonna take me a while to remember, you know, get my muscle memory back, and dear lord, I need to finish getting Alucard all of his skills.
2311329	2315911	I've already done the two monster fight and I did the doppelganger fight already.
2315911	2318633	I was way too underpowered for the doppelganger fight.
2318633	2319273	But you know what?
2319273	2322555	You can carry turkey and chicken in your pocket and that'll save you.
2326416	2329777	I know I've played a couple of other things.
2329777	2346520	I've basically been trying to find ISOs for games that I own, so I don't have to dig out my Saturn every time that I want to play them, or my Wii or anything like that.
2346520	2352581	So I am planning on doing a random old-school
2353180	2360368	game night like once a week since Baldur's Gate 3 is being such a fail for me.
2360368	2363712	Well, nothing wrong with retro throwbacks and all that good stuff.
2363712	2366435	I love me a retro game.
2366435	2370780	Yeah, me too, because I'm old.
2370780	2371781	All right.
2371781	2373903	Well, if that's all, we'll move on to Loki.
2373903	2374584	How was your gaming week?
2375888	2377189	It was basically Minecraft.
2377189	2383371	I've been grinding, trying to get resources for a build I'm doing on Fever Dream, which I'm just about done doing.
2383371	2395896	And then I did play a little bit of my Playdate, so I was checking out Pickpack Pup, which is a match-three type game where you have to pack up items into boxes and you get money for that.
2395896	2397837	And they have a trasher.
2397837	2402779	Basically, as time goes on, it starts trashing the bottom row, and you lose money from that.
2403659	2404319	That's fun.
2404319	2409661	If I may, if I may, I have an urgent thing to tell Rob.
2409661	2410902	Sure.
2410902	2416424	I found your cartridge for $21.99.
2416424	2419525	Please send me the link, but make sure it's not the arcade collection.
2419525	2420545	There's a difference.
2420545	2421506	Never mind.
2421506	2422526	I should have put that out there.
2422526	2425607	There's an arcade collection that's still in print.
2425607	2428108	It has to have Dragonsview on it.
2428108	2430589	Just remember Dragonsview.
2430589	2431429	I'm back on the hunt.
2431429	2432630	Alright, back on the hunt.
2432630	2432870	Okay.
2434963	2436063	Come on, you know me.
2436063	2437324	I know, I know.
2437324	2438024	All right.
2438024	2440324	Well, that's it for Loki's gaming week.
2440324	2446085	My gaming week, a lot of Final Fantasy 14 still playing a little bit of Overwatch 2 actually.
2446085	2452427	I was playing Overwatch 2 with Grandpa Warcraft or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling actually a couple nights ago.
2452427	2454247	And because he actually plays that game quite a bit.
2454247	2457148	So we were playing together for a little bit and that was always fun.
2457828	2459970	I, uh, this is random, but not really.
2459970	2461051	Uh, I was playing Diablo 3.
2461051	2462493	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
2462493	2464855	Why would I be playing Diablo 3 when Diablo 4 is out?
2464855	2476707	Because Season 30 of Diablo 3 started this last week, and I was curious, and I wanted to go back and check it out because, um, this is the first season that is essentially not new.
2476707	2478569	They're recycling stuff, but they're
2478869	2480150	Paragon Board Alter of Rights
2508829	2512132	If you play a necromancer, you can get to level 70 in 60 minutes because of this board.
2512132	2513193	It's pretty cool.
2513193	2517618	And it has the portals to the other realms during the bounties that the last season had.
2517618	2518739	So it's just interesting.
2518739	2520420	And I've been enjoying checking that out.
2520420	2522342	I'm not going to go too far with this season.
2522342	2527848	But it's it's, you know, it's fun to go back and visit an old friend and say hello, I missed you.
2528865	2541470	because you know retro I is Diablo 3 a retro game at this point I think so when did it come out originally 2012 maybe I can't remember what year it came out but I think it's over 10 years old at this point so it's a classic game for me
2542560	2545541	So that's otherwise that's pretty much my gaming week a little bit.
2545541	2547421	I have been playing a little bit of my Evercade.
2547421	2549782	I haven't I just got the Atari one yesterday though.
2549782	2551923	So I haven't gotten this open this yet.
2551923	2556504	And I have the Namco one and Namco two collections which are also out of print.
2556504	2558965	I have those on the way.
2558965	2563206	Because of course, who doesn't need another way to play Pacman?
2563206	2565247	Who doesn't need another way to play Pacman?
2565247	2565847	I have that on the way.
2567310	2573034	All right, let's get into some gaming news of the week.
2573034	2577237	Starting off with a bummer, but it's something we've got to talk about, right, Loki?
2577237	2580960	Yeah, there's been a lot of layoffs in the beginning of the year.
2580960	2586324	I'm guessing because this is the quarter four for a lot of companies for their financial year.
2587817	2588978	Let's go over them.
2588978	2598724	Already this year we've had over 2700 layoffs across a variety of different companies.
2598724	2600205	Unity laid off 1800 people, or 25% of its staff.
2607190	2610972	continuing its reset, if you will.
2610972	2614633	Bossa Studios laid off 19 people.
2614633	2620275	Looks like Archaic, they laid off an unknown number of people.
2620275	2625777	Twitch laid off 500 people, which is 35% of its total staff.
2625777	2627678	Playtika laid off 300 to 400 people.
2627678	2628158	Discord, 170.
2628158	2628378	And then...
2634994	2649246	God, I think there was even more than that, but like, oh yeah, we had Lost Boys Interactive, there was an unknown number of people, and then FunSelector, which I think is probably a smaller studio, laid off three people as well, three developers.
2649246	2653810	Lots of layoffs, and that sucks.
2655123	2656943	Obviously they'll be able to bounce back.
2656943	2661345	Obviously the Twitch one really resonates because, you know, that's the platform we're broadcasting on now.
2661345	2665566	And many of us, you know, either partake or you'll create Twitch streams as well.
2665566	2671847	So it's a little bit shocking to hear because they just, you may recall, they just had layoffs already towards the end of last year.
2671847	2671987	Yeah.
2671987	2679069	And they were saying that they're being, they're unprofitable, even though they've made like $13 billion on the platform as well, which is interesting.
2680076	2686576	It's interesting to think what Twitch is going to do to try to keep surviving because I just, I...
2687697	2689198	I don't know.
2689198	2691920	I would be so bummed if Twitch went away.
2691920	2693381	I really would.
2693381	2695522	Because there's just not a lot of great alternatives out there.
2695522	2707690	I'm not going to the green site, and I guess there's YouTube, which is... I've certainly had my issues with YouTube in the past, and I continue to, but I feel like, I guess, if YouTube's a thing, then sure.
2707690	2710732	But I like what we've got going here at Twitch.
2710732	2711813	It's just really, yeah.
2712673	2716414	I'm shocked they can lay off 30% of the staff and the lights are still on.
2716414	2718095	I'm like, where did where did they cut those people?
2718095	2722856	Is that is that from how many employees?
2722856	2727797	It's just, yeah, shocking.
2727797	2732218	Sj100 Matt in our chat says this is them saying see, we're not heartless monsters.
2732218	2733999	We didn't lay folks off during the holidays.
2733999	2734579	Aren't we great?
2735697	2739859	Talk about doing the bare minimum.
2739859	2743601	Questbuster in chat says Twitch's burn rate must be wild.
2743601	2748564	They allegedly take in a ton of revenue, but none of it is actual profit.
2748564	2751305	So where's the money going?
2751305	2753806	Is it all bandwidth?
2753806	2755767	I don't know.
2755767	2756508	I don't know either.
2756508	2757068	To be fair,
2759249	2766075	We hear about these multi-million dollar CEOs, we hear about the golden parachute for Bobby Kotick, and it pisses us all off.
2766075	2772742	I'm assuming that Twitch doesn't quite have as fat of a top.
2772742	2776866	I'm sure the CEO does pretty well for himself, but I don't think the top is nearly as fat.
2777486	2780190	So I'm very curious.
2780190	2780811	Yeah.
2780811	2783455	As Jonah Matt says, the maintenance cost is very high.
2783455	2789224	The rumor that part of the Twitch sale was due to the very Amazon Web Services costs that they owed.
2789224	2790787	That is wild.
2792298	2797283	Well then Amazon needs, again, I would say some of this is Amazon's fault.
2797283	2800465	I would say Amazon leverages Twitch very poorly.
2800465	2801807	Very, very poorly.
2801807	2804749	There's much more that Amazon could lean into.
2804749	2812757	The watch parties was a start, but I bet half of you forgot that was even a thing until I mentioned it just now.
2813257	2818141	you know, to try to drive more eyes towards Amazon Prime and the shows that they're doing there.
2818141	2823125	I just I'm, I really feel like Twitch runs in a bubble compared to the rest of Amazon.
2823125	2834315	And it's just a little weird that they don't try to find opportunities to help each other, especially when it comes to things like things like Luna, and their push into cloud gaming, Prime Gaming and all this.
2834315	2840740	It's just wild to me how that stuff isn't consistent, which is so strange to me.
2840740	2840840	So
2842093	2850867	Questbuster in chat says my guess is that Amazon looks at the Twitch silo and wonders what else could be actually making money with that infrastructure versus what is sitting there now.
2852188	2853368	It's Twitch.
2853368	2865011	Twitch has communities and influencers of varying degrees that can get people to listen, you know, and, and, you know, think and sometimes act.
2865011	2870733	And I just, I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't try to leverage more in the sponsorships and all that for it.
2870733	2878575	I guess maybe I should have put this in my predictions, but I do think, I think at some point you're going to have to have a Twitch Pro membership in order to be able to stream.
2880894	2882426	I think they're going to charge people to stream.
2883411	2885873	You don't make enough money on that platform to do that.
2885873	2891737	Like, that's what I'm saying is like, you can try to do that and your platform will die immediately.
2891737	2892297	Yeah.
2892297	2895799	Like, because I feel like that's I know, I know.
2895799	2911089	I know everybody's groaning, but take that prediction the way that Matt brought up the Bobby Kotick thing earlier, because I see that that's going to be like the Hail Mary thing is that you have to be either like Amazon Prime or Twitch Pro in order to be able to stream on the service.
2913052	2917876	Yes, let me pay for the privilege to make you money.
2917876	2921399	I'm sorry, this is no, it's not going to happen.
2921399	2924722	S2100mat says, I don't see Amazon selling or killing off Twitch.
2924722	2927084	I do see them buying outside investors.
2927084	2931547	I can think of a certain private investment fund that everyone hates that would buy more shares of Amazon.
2935563	2940006	And how on earth is the green site making money?
2940006	2941146	That's what I want to know.
2941146	2943067	How on earth is the other site?
2943067	2945509	I have no idea what you're talking about.
2945509	2947170	Are you talking about the one that starts with a K?
2947170	2947790	Yes.
2947790	2948911	Yeah.
2948911	2949771	Oh God.
2949771	2950272	I don't know.
2950272	2950912	I don't think they are.
2951403	2956044	Yeah, so I'm like, if they're if they're not losing money that site.
2956044	2959946	Yeah, that's the thing is like everyone's saying that they're profitable, but they're not.
2959946	2970809	They're paying like millions of dollars to get people on the platform, but they don't have advertisers, especially since the platform touts itself on being like uncensored.
2970809	2972529	Like who's going to really want to advertise on there?
2972529	2974070	Well, I can tell you who's going to advertise on there.
2974070	2974590	Gambling.
2974590	2974770	Yeah.
2974770	2974910	Yeah.
2978433	2984575	So, I mean, I don't think that's going to be around very long either.
2984575	2986676	I think the bubble breaks on that one.
2986676	2989837	And when it bursts, it bursts quickly and without warning.
2989837	2992458	And a lot of people are going to be very disappointed.
2992458	2996839	And look, I'm not completely trying to shit on that site.
2996839	3004942	I realize there are some fine folks that have decided to take a stab on a new venture because, you know, and I respect that and so forth.
3004942	3005522	I just think
3007153	3008213	I know what we should have done.
3008213	3009614	One of the predictions would have been...
3027751	3040454	that by the end of this year Twitch fully embraces adult content with its own like sectioned off section because they're they're dabbling with it but and I think that's gonna be hard for them to ignore that kind of money.
3042092	3045893	QuestBuster, you know, and in fairness, I think this is this is a fair perspective.
3045893	3054156	This is why we say we're the show where every gamer has a voice because sometimes y'all lend some excellent thoughts to the suggestion and QuestBuster, sometimes you don't, but this one is.
3054156	3062498	QuestBuster says, or another perspective, casinos in Vegas survived the pandemic because of how deep their pockets are.
3062498	3065299	You know what's interesting, though?
3065299	3069080	If you go to Vegas now, versus before the pandemic,
3070367	3077210	There's a, at least for me personally, after this last trip to Vegas, I don't want to go back.
3077210	3081692	Because now Vegas is starting to nickel and dime for the stupidest shit.
3081692	3085073	They're charging for parking in Vegas now.
3085073	3089355	Remember when that was free to entice you to park at the casino to gamble money there?
3089355	3094337	The, you would, I could eat a meal cheaper at Disneyland.
3094337	3095157	True story.
3095157	3096738	I live, this is not hyperbole.
3097845	3103210	I ate a meal at Disneyland cheaper than eating at Panda Express at the Venetian.
3122648	3125069	They're charging like hundreds of dollars for tickets.
3125069	3128411	Like who's going to go watch a short movie for hundreds of dollars?
3128411	3132793	Like, yeah, that's why the bubbles I think you're starting to see.
3132793	3137695	And to be fair to QuestBuster, it's not like Vegas suddenly shuts down.
3137695	3141857	But QuestBuster, I want you to look at another and everybody.
3141857	3143038	Sorry, QuestBuster, I'm not picking on you.
3143038	3145099	You actually give great insight here.
3145099	3147740	Everybody that's thinking about this, look at that.
3147740	3151722	I want you to look at what happens, what's happening in Reno, Nevada.
3153203	3155527	Die at Vegas.
3155527	3158432	I can't believe it's not Vegas.
3158432	3162099	You told me we were gonna go to Vegas, but instead we went to Reno.
3162099	3163983	Take a look at what's happened in Reno.
3164997	3169180	because the bubble on the gambling and all that kind of has burst in Reno.
3169180	3170261	And you know why?
3170261	3180890	Because California does allow gambling on and well, it's it's part this and part this, but California does allow gambling within Native American land.
3180890	3188656	And so there are and you know, there's at least what five really rich resort casinos in this area that we live in.
3188656	3192599	And so a lot of folks in the Bay Area, this area, they don't go to Reno to gamble anymore.
3192599	3193180	They can do it here.
3193900	3196062	So the bubbles kind of burst on gambling.
3196062	3199746	And Reno is having to kind of reinvent itself as a tech hub.
3199746	3201487	And that's what you see Reno kind of becoming now.
3201487	3203649	Yes, it still has Circus Circus.
3203649	3207533	But Hera's fucking closed.
3207533	3216682	That's a that's like the place Jay Leno, Jode Rivers, you know, despite whatever you think of these comedians, these were huge comics, the 80s, these are huge shows, the bubbles burst.
3217549	3242428	and I think for sure what an icon and while I don't think Vegas is going to meet the same fate I really don't I think Vegas is always going to have that sense of excess and you know all that stuff I do think there's going to be a pushback on this whole like whatever happened to doing Vegas fucking cheap because that used to be the draw for Reno as well whatever happened to just fucking doing cheap shit in Reno and then it wasn't so cheap anymore and
3244157	3244937	What happened?
3244937	3245297	You know what?
3245297	3247898	The one thing that's still cheap in Reno?
3247898	3250758	$5.99 steak and eggs at the Calneva.
3250758	3256100	Would you ever in your life eat $5.99 steak and eggs?
3256100	3257720	But you know what?
3257720	3261721	Do you know what resort is still open?
3261721	3264981	Calneva.
3264981	3269062	The one that is infamously the Trashy Dumpy place?
3269062	3270022	Still there.
3270022	3270983	Why?
3270983	3272263	Trashy Dumpy reputation.
3273806	3276627	Anyway, just some thoughts.
3276627	3281430	Okay, um, how did we get from layoffs to talking about CalNeva?
3281430	3283791	Only here on Orange Lounge Radio would that happen.
3283791	3288513	Uh, but- It was, well, let's see, we talked Twitch, the kick, to gambling- I know, I know.
3289358	3294541	So my point is that I don't want to make light of this because obviously, you know, this this story sucks.
3294541	3297783	And I'm going to go back to the predictions at the top of the show.
3297783	3303366	And I'm just going to really hope for these folks that there can be some diamonds made out of this coal.
3303366	3310731	And that, you know, the nice thing about the gaming industry is that you can be empowered to do this on your own.
3310731	3317475	And I hope people that have had to bear the brunt of these layoffs are and I know not everybody's going to have the means to do it, but I hope those that do
3318795	3324479	are able to create a really awesome indie game and a new studio.
3324479	3332665	Because that is one thing you do hear about also in this industry, a lot of new studios that opened up people that used to work at another place.
3332665	3340031	So I hope this is a rebirth of some really cool studios that make some really fun games.
3340031	3342633	I don't know what else I can say on that because otherwise, it's pretty dreary.
3344844	3349705	But, if these big studios get caught doing- if they get caught cutting quarters with AI...
3351226	3352387	Capcom New Year New DRM
3375842	3382505	A new update for Resident Evil Revelations added more software to prevent modding.
3382505	3387106	You want nude Resident Evil characters too bad.
3387106	3399711	This is pissing off Capcom's community because of course there's a lot of people that make mods and not just I obviously we always joke about nude mods, but there's a variety of mods out there in the community of all sorts.
3399711	3402092	And this is pissing the modding community off.
3403140	3410003	In October, Capcom published a developer video where the company said, mods are no different from cheating.
3410003	3411203	You remember that?
3411203	3415605	There was that whole to-do where they were like, mods are basically cheating.
3415605	3423228	And there was some interesting, like, clickbaitiness to that, but that, that, some are saying that was the smoke before this fire here.
3424849	3444532	and then of course also what happened is that you had that tournament that happened recently where they were playing Street Fighter and then oops Chun-Li's naked oops all boobs that mod was installed on the Street Fighter and that did not look great because that was being streamed on Twitch and all that stuff
3445646	3452858	About a month ago, Capcom started to do takedown notices on Monster Hunter videos which either featured a mod, mentioned a mod.
3452858	3459609	Capcom Japan was going after Sunbreak videos on YouTube if you were running a mod, and it was takedown requests, copyright strikes.
3463672	3471016	Capcom added a piece of software called Enigma to a back catalog of games on the PC.
3471016	3474297	Enigma can be used as DRM software.
3474297	3482302	It does appear that what is happening here is that modders are being prevented from affecting the .exe or executable file.
3483874	3492505	Some other titles include Mega Man Zero and ZX Legacy Collection, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, Resident Evil Revelations, and so forth.
3494137	3500703	Since then, what's interesting, there's been a forum exchange that happened, and the patch was recently removed.
3500703	3506868	Capcom said, due to an issue observed with the latest update released, we have reverted the corresponding update.
3506868	3512452	We apologize for the inconvenience caused, and once the issue is resolved, we will re-release the update.
3512452	3522581	They don't say what that is, but... I think because the issue that I heard about that was that it was preventing games from running on the Steam Deck.
3523382	3526764	Oops, not great.
3526764	3532669	Yeah, at least I think I've seen some screenshots regarding that and it was it was because of that update.
3532669	3538413	But it's stupid, like, like, especially a lot of games.
3538413	3543797	A lot of those like copy protection and anti piracy and anti cheating software.
3544933	3562482	Um, they are pretty exclusionary when it comes to Unix systems as well, which is a big reason why some of, like many, like Dead by Daylight for the longest time wouldn't run on Steam Deck because, uh, the anti-cheat that it uses, um, won't run on Unix-based systems.
3562482	3572968	Well, although now that it's running on, uh, on, uh, Linux, a Linux system, I don't see any reason why they can't do a native macOS version, but that's a different story.
3573368	3577450	This just, it's just such an overreaction, I think, on Capcom's part.
3577450	3586636	If they're pissed about the Tiddy mod, then that's an issue with that particular tournament, and what went wrong with that tournament allowing that software to run.
3586636	3589757	And that's something that Capcom needs to take up with that tournament.
3589757	3600904	Because, like, this type of overreach of, now we gotta disable every mod that does anything in the game, is, it just strikes me as very, oh, I don't know,
3601784	3608128	We're gonna delete PictoChat off of every 3DS because a child might see a phallic drawing.
3608128	3623379	No, there's a lot of like people that have that kind of take where like, for example, even not necessarily with cheating, but like in Minecraft, one of the takes as well, we feel that villagers are too OP, they're too overpowered, their trades
3623959	3624539	Thanks for watching!
3644108	3645810	Feeling that it's too overpowered.
3645810	3647852	Like then just don't play that way.
3647852	3649955	Why ruin it for everybody else?
3649955	3652177	And then of course the game companies, they do that.
3652177	3656422	They just ruin it for everybody else because that's what they're exactly what they're doing right now.
3656422	3660627	More gameplay equals a grindier experience for whatever reason.
3661380	3674828	You know, Capcom just announced a new Monster Hunter game not that long ago, and if you piss off your community, and they're pissing off the Monster Hunter community with this, that's not a good look for pushing pre-orders for your game.
3674828	3679511	You probably want to stew on that a little bit, Capcom.
3679511	3684233	I feel like 2024 is going to be a year of fuck around and find out for some of these big companies.
3684233	3684894	It really is.
3687113	3694377	Maybe I'm just wishful thinking on the accountability front, but I really feel like fuckaroundfindout is going to take on a whole new meaning this year.
3694377	3698019	There's a lot of people threatening things.
3698019	3700960	They're like, oh, if this company does this, then I'm not going to support them.
3700960	3702581	You have to fucking do it.
3702581	3703862	You have to fucking do it.
3703862	3706543	Then they just go and buy their game and they're like, well,
3707759	3709761	Backlash was hardly anything.
3709761	3722557	I don't really see the point though, because to me, like, it's not ruining the, like, say you're modding these games, it's not ruining the balance of these games or anything, like, who cares?
3722557	3726541	Especially with old back catalog games, like, I don't understand what the point is.
3727443	3729205	in preventing modding on these.
3729205	3732449	Like, is it really, like, disparaging your name?
3732449	3741280	Like, just because someone makes a nude mod for Street Fighter, I'm not gonna be, like, thinking, oh, Capcom and their perverted game with nudity in it.
3741280	3743443	Like, I'm not an idiot.
3743443	3745145	I guess there's a lot of idiots out there, but...
3746590	3750912	I just feel like the impact from that is so nothing.
3750912	3752813	Like, it's just not gonna be a thing.
3752813	3760537	Yeah, I do agree, because look at what, you know, we just talked about all the Steamboat Willie stuff, which by the way, that all seemed to disappear this week, which is lovely.
3761918	3768402	But like, you know, now that Steamboat Willie's public domain, you know, somebody's drawn Mickey Mouse's dong and all this stuff.
3768402	3769482	I'm sure it's out there.
3769482	3769963	It's the internet.
3769963	3770563	Yes, just now.
3770563	3773925	Steam public domain hasn't stopped people from pulling that.
3773925	3777867	But my point is, none of that, like, people are able to separate that.
3777867	3779528	Oh my god, I saw a dong.
3779528	3781289	This is Disney's fault?
3781289	3782069	No.
3782069	3783030	People know the difference.
3783030	3786632	Oh my god, Winnie the Pooh is a killer because that movie
3787432	3788313	No.
3788313	3790874	Like, reasonable people know the difference.
3790874	3794135	There's always going to be unreasonable people.
3794135	3796076	Stop.
3796076	3799238	Stop amplifying them.
3799238	3800759	There's always going to be unreasonable people.
3800759	3804381	Stop amplifying them.
3804381	3805261	Yeah.
3805261	3806902	All right.
3806902	3810904	Moving on, let's move on to something else.
3810904	3814606	Something else big that's been happening this week, actually, DarkSakura.
3816107	3822109	Sony has done some teases, teases, teases, teases.
3822109	3827830	They have made mention of Gravity Rush as a movie.
3827830	3834472	They've put out some of the artwork and the teaser for it at CES 2024.
3839142	3842284	It looks like it's going to be pretty neat.
3842284	3856473	I mean, they have like, I guess it's assumed that it's Cat from Gravity Rush is jumping toward a dragon and shows some mocap stuff and all kinds of interesting things.
3856473	3861996	And then something else for a Patapon project.
3861996	3866419	Like it shows the Patapons fighting a mammoth and then
3867580	3869801	Yeah, it's interesting.
3869801	3876105	It's all 3D, of course, not like the original Patapon was.
3876105	3880507	But it could be interesting.
3880507	3883549	I will, of course, reserve my judgment for when I have something more to judge.
3885868	3888690	Yeah, some pretty light teases there on the CES front.
3888690	3894433	I mean, again, CES is not supposed to be a gaming announcement thing.
3894433	3902878	But sometimes you get a little bit, and especially because if you go way, way back, E3 originally was a spinoff of CES.
3902878	3904479	So I was just kind of curious if maybe E3
3905760	3909241	passing away was going to cause CES to maybe absorb a little bit.
3909241	3912043	Maybe it's too soon, maybe next year.
3912043	3915424	But we have little bits from Sony, little bits.
3915424	3929850	There's another little tidbit, although just if it wasn't on anyone's radar, because this has been out on the web for a while, is that there was a Kickstarter for a sequel to Patapon called Ratatan.
3929850	3931070	Yeah, I remember seeing that.
3931070	3935052	It looked cool.
3935052	3935352	All right.
3937758	3945561	Also, it was mentioned in chat, Dr. Tia says, we usually get Arcade 1UP announcements, but I don't think they had anything this year.
3945561	3950582	Yeah, apparently, I have not heard of Arcade 1UP doing anything.
3950582	3956924	There's, I'm looking at the Reddit for Arcade 1UP and there's, you know, insiders that are saying they're not announcing anything at CES 2024.
3956924	3960325	They just, the timing's not right.
3960325	3964546	It sounds like.
3964546	3964906	All right.
3965456	3970542	Moving on, another controversy brewing in the community, Loki.
3970542	3985019	Yeah, so this is kind of adjacent to what SAG-AFTRA was just dealing with with their strikes in regards to AI and replicating voice actors or actors, I guess.
3985780	4009030	So now apparently they've signed a deal, or SAG-AFTRA has, they're engaging with a company called Replica Studios, who will basically allow folks to use actors who have licensed their likeness in voice to be used with the studio to generate dialogue.
4009030	4014453	I think that there's some actors are very, apparently it's not a,
4015558	4028763	popular opinion because there's actors basically responding back with this announcement like saying, excuse me, you know, you say approved by the affected members of the union's voiceover performer community.
4028763	4031664	Nobody in our community has approved this that I know of.
4031664	4035085	Games are a bulk of my livelihood and have been for years.
4035085	4036545	Who are you referring to?
4036545	4040567	Like who is basically, you know, giving you the okay for this?
4040567	4041447	And, and, um,
4042495	4053506	They said, from voice actor Elias to Fexus, basically said, I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors in games.
4053506	4054707	No one asked me about this.
4054707	4056349	No one reached out for my opinion.
4056349	4059172	From what I've seen, no one asked any of my peers either.
4059172	4060053	So basically, they're
4060533	4065416	It's almost like they're moving ahead without getting the input from their members.
4065416	4067698	But I assume they're going to work this all out.
4067698	4086491	But once again, stuff like this and the whole stuff with some of the AI image generators, especially nowadays, where they're finding out that, hey, look, if I put this prompt in, I can get something that looks exactly like a frame of video from a major Hollywood movie.
4087679	4089500	And you're saying that this is okay?
4089500	4101269	Like, because clearly it's violating copyright because they were trained on copyrighted materials because there's no way they'd be able to mimic it down to it almost being a one-to-one exact frame from a movie.
4101269	4106713	Like, if they put the prompt in, they go find a frame of that movie that matches that almost identically.
4107611	4116241	I believe I brought this up last week because I'm friends with a few folks and definitely the complaining is loud.
4116241	4122067	They're basically saying this is what we were striking against and you're going behind our back doing this.
4122067	4122188	Yeah.
4123180	4147012	yeah um and and on top of that i mean i'm sure y'all saw the thing about them doing a george carlin special without george carlin that is christ that is that's awful yeah and and that guy should be sued the person that put that on youtube should be sued by george carlin's estate his daughter commented on it commenting on it's not enough legal action needs to be taken
4147665	4148966	I listened to some of it.
4148966	4150187	I tried to listen to some of it.
4172168	4173610	There's something missing.
4173610	4181663	Like, the voice does sound like him, and the jokes sound like jokes he would have made, but there's just something that's way off about it.
4181663	4187131	Like, even if I didn't know it was an AI, there's, like, a quality.
4188183	4191045	that's missing, certain inflections that are missing.
4191045	4193806	I know certainly you can hear when an audience is pieced in.
4193806	4212556	Yeah, I don't know if it's actually AI generating the voice or if it's AI generating the visuals for it because I believe that the voice is done by Will Sasso because they had an interview with him and he said that he had studied to learn to do an impression of him and wanted to do all that.
4212556	4213097	So I wasn't
4213857	4221343	certain that he trained like an AI thing to replicate it with like mimicking his voice.
4221343	4224246	You would think that would be just easier just to get the live.
4224246	4226087	Doesn't sound like a human.
4226087	4226548	No.
4226548	4227128	Yeah, it's.
4228618	4230099	We're not there yet, but it's hopeful.
4250899	4253721	I think the union made a hasty decision.
4253721	4258284	I think they are a little bit fearful of how fast AI is progressing.
4258284	4261227	And to that extent, I understand.
4261227	4266991	And so they hastily, and this is where I think I don't understand, made a deal with this one organization.
4266991	4269533	I understand actors can like opt out of it and stuff.
4269533	4270673	There's a lot like it's not like
4271654	4277519	What this deal doesn't do, it doesn't mean that every voice actor out there automatically has to submit to AI.
4277519	4277840	No.
4277840	4280322	It allows this one company to be able to do it.
4280322	4290651	So I feel like SAG-AFTRA kind of entered into this deal to sort of stop the AI thing from growing out of control.
4290651	4297197	I'm not excusing it, but what I'm saying is that the lesson to be learned here, and I think what's happening and you're hearing the voice actors kind of push back, is that
4297697	4303118	They don't like they feel like this decision was made so hastily their voice was not in the room.
4303118	4305999	You know, negotiators made this decision on their behalf.
4305999	4313241	And it sounds like a lot of voice actors really wish they had been consulted or they had been in the room or they were allowed to get their input on this situation that didn't happen.
4313241	4315381	And that's a union problem.
4315381	4321683	So there's a lot of people who were already like saying, you know, if this doesn't get rectified, I'm tearing up the card.
4323536	4325017	I can understand.
4325017	4326457	You want your union to represent you.
4326457	4330458	And when they don't represent you, why are you paying the dues?
4330458	4338641	And yeah, it looks like there's already a call for another strike and this time striking the union.
4338641	4341222	Oh, this could get interesting.
4341222	4341902	All right.
4341902	4342803	Yeah.
4342803	4350625	So I'll have to ask a couple of a couple of of my friends and see if they have anything to say about anything that I could say.
4350625	4352626	But I'll ask a couple of folks.
4352626	4352786	Yeah.
4353366	4358949	or peek at Twitter too, you know, there's a few voice actors out there that are very vocal about all of this.
4358949	4360509	So that's basically where my friends still are.
4360509	4361630	Yeah.
4361630	4364031	So, all right.
4364031	4374756	Moving on, speaking of people talking about things, let's talk about Yoshi P, the director behind Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XVI, Naoki Yoshida, who's known as Yoshi P.
4376617	4390733	He's been asked about Final Fantasy XVII, because, you know, XVI's out, the DLC is, you know, the first part's out, the second part will be out at some point, but I think now the world is ready to hear about Final Fantasy XVII, or asking this sort of thing.
4390733	4395599	So, somebody straight up asked him, Yoshi-P, are you doing Final Fantasy XVII?
4395599	4396319	Are you directing it?
4397020	4400904	YoshiP hesitated and said he's on the board of directors now.
4400904	4404587	So he didn't give a clear answer to the question, which is interesting.
4404587	4411374	But what he did say, which then because you know, the interview, you would usually read into that, well, yes, he's doing it because he's not saying anything about it.
4411374	4418141	But then he said, maybe it's time for someone new, instead of having the same old guys handle the next one.
4419400	4430278	He said, I think in some ways it would be good to look to the future and bring in a younger generation with more youthful sensibilities to make a new Final Fantasy with challenges that suit today's world.
4431884	4438387	A good follow-up question he was asked after that would be, what advice would you give to that younger Final Fantasy XVII director?
4438387	4444130	And he said, Final Fantasy is about challenging what's been done before.
4444130	4450573	While I'm certainly not looking to pick a fight with the older games, we all make Final Fantasy games thinking, mine will be the most fun.
4450573	4458177	So my advice is to just dive in and first put down on paper what you believe would be the most enjoyable Final Fantasy before thinking too hard about it.
4458877	4467979	Then from there, you can decide things like, since 16 was real-time action, my Final Fantasy is going to have both real-time action and turn-based battles.
4467979	4473600	Or you could go the other extreme and return it to its fully turn-based pixel art roots.
4473600	4474520	That would be groundbreaking.
4474520	4475180	Yes, you could.
4475180	4476641	That would be great.
4476641	4483122	Yeah, bring it back to turn-based, because turn-based... What's interesting is a lot of sites are now running the headline.
4483122	4487743	Yoshi P says Final Fantasy 17 could go back to its pixel-based roots.
4489383	4489783	It's not.
4501439	4511442	It would be cool, but I also kind of feel like the door is open for that to be expressed in other ways, and that would be direct sequels to things like Final Fantasy IV.
4511442	4515583	Why not do a Final Fantasy V, too, after all these years?
4515583	4520424	I think revisiting V's old job system—I mean, I'm basically explaining Bravely Default.
4521024	4525986	But I think going back and exploring Final Fantasy V's job system, all that would be like a lot of fun.
4525986	4532169	Why not go back and revisit some of the old pixel based games and make like, you know, a more direct sequel?
4532169	4536310	Because they did do that with Final Fantasy IV The After Years, you know, before somebody corrects me on that.
4536310	4539191	But I think I think it'd be fun to see some of that.
4539191	4541012	I think Final Fantasy XVII can be something new.
4541012	4542793	I don't think it has to necessarily be retro.
4544234	4547838	100% but I do love the idea of going back to a turn-based game.
4547838	4550782	I think a lot of people would be very happy.
4550782	4554866	I would be on board because I haven't picked up the real creative direction.
4554866	4557069	But also to YoshiP's credit, I think it's
4558470	4571525	I think the fact that he would say, maybe it shouldn't be me, maybe it should be somebody younger, is a lot of the reason why a lot of people really like Yoshi P. I also don't think he should sell himself short.
4571525	4573207	I think if he does want to do it, he should.
4575575	4581260	Yes, as much of a fan as I am of his and what he's done for 14, and I mostly like 16.
4581260	4586605	I had my issues with it, but it was certainly better than 15, and there was a lot more good than there was bad.
4586605	4587285	And you know what?
4587285	4589307	It gave the world Ben Starr.
4589307	4590107	And isn't that enough?
4591067	4609006	So with all that in mind, I'm fine if somebody else takes on 17 or whatever, but I'm glad YoshiP is on the board of directors, because that's the voice we need in the room, I think.
4609006	4611088	And that's why I like him.
4611088	4613290	So he's a voice we need in the room, as far as I'm concerned.
4615123	4620505	DarkTetsuya says, I don't know, still waiting for 6.2.
4620505	4623146	Yeah, I think a lot of people would love to see that someday.
4623146	4626968	SJ100Matt says, Preach, Rob, Final Fantasy Remake and Reimagining would be nice.
4626968	4629810	I feel like it's like a forgotten game.
4629810	4631330	You know, let's see.
4631330	4635592	Asiya Tabiri says, Screw it, make 17 a text-based MMO.
4635592	4639754	And Orangerite says, 17 is a BBS door game, essentially.
4641275	4642980	I'd love that.
4642980	4643701	You know what, though?
4643701	4646308	Orange Rite brings up a good comparison, though.
4646308	4650237	Final Fantasy XVII going the Mega Man 9 route?
4651383	4655227	Fifth Dream is saying he can't work on 2 MMOs, so he's gotta let new people work on 17.
4655227	4659792	If you are a pattern theorist, what I mean by that is, 11 was an MMO, 14 was an MMO, 17?
4674713	4679015	Numerically could be the next MMO, could be.
4679015	4679495	So we'll see.
4679495	4689879	I would not be upset with another MMO, but I actually, I just, I feel like it's gonna be 18, not 17, because Final Fantasy 14's still hot.
4689879	4700703	And I think Square Enix doesn't totally wanna cannibalize itself, which yes, I know Final Fantasy XI fans, you have something to say about that, but XI is still existing,
4701516	4703657	which says a lot, to be honest.
4703657	4707800	The fact that Final Fantasy XI still exists is actually fucking impressive.
4707800	4715685	But I just, I feel like they're gonna ride out the, keep in mind, Final Fantasy XIV makes Square Enix a lot of money.
4715685	4719168	When I say, I mean a lot of money.
4719168	4723510	They're not gonna, they're gonna keep that train going for a while.
4723510	4725532	So I think maybe Final Fantasy XVIII, but not XVII.
4727438	4729078	All right.
4729078	4733239	Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on.
4733239	4739481	I guess, I guess maybe DarkSakura, you could talk about another system that we could see Final Fantasy 17 on.
4739481	4742662	Possibly so, although I highly doubt it.
4742662	4745002	Anyone remember the Atari 400?
4745002	4745682	No.
4745682	4752124	You know, well, you know, they had to, there was the 800, you know, and before that was the 400.
4753687	4756830	And it was an early Atari computer.
4756830	4764276	It had controller jacks in front, one of those little, like, Odyssey 2-style keyboards on it, you know?
4764276	4769180	That was all just a plastic panel over switches.
4769180	4772123	Well, there's an announcement now for the Atari 400 Mini.
4774845	4778267	It's about half the size of the original, which did come out in 1978.
4778267	4786913	And it has the updated version of the CX-40 Atari joystick.
4786913	4789375	And it will work with USB.
4789375	4791977	You can use other devices with it.
4791977	4794778	It has five USB ports.
4794778	4799562	You can use external keyboards and sideload games and you name it.
4799562	4804285	And an HDMI port so you can hook it up to a TV or monitor.
4805826	4827763	It has 25 titles already on it from the 8-bit era of Atari, and it has things like Berserk, Millipede, Miner, 24Niner, Mule, Star Raiders 2, and it has save states and rewinds and
4828363	4831084	All kinds of stuff and this is by Retro Games.
4831084	4835066	The same ones also did the mini Amiga 500 and Commodore 64.
4835066	4840868	I was gonna say this thing very much fits the Commodore 64 mini template.
4840868	4843869	That's not a bad thing.
4843869	4845549	And you can order it.
4845549	4847290	It's set for release on March 28 for $119.99.
4853362	4857745	SSJ100 Matt in chat says I'm excited about this and I already pre-ordered it.
4857745	4861608	It's kind of an obscure Atari console compared to the others, but I'm all for it.
4861608	4865812	The Atari 400 was the first console my family got before I was born.
4865812	4867914	Still have my Atari 400 and it works.
4867914	4874659	And I think there's going to be enough people in SSJ100 Matt's boat that like have the nostalgia thing that this is going to do well.
4874659	4875720	And it looks like a cute device.
4875720	4876941	I love that you can sideload
4877401	4880562	And I love that the company, you know, they did this with the C64 mini as well.
4880562	4882183	And I love that they're not shying away from that.
4882183	4885464	I think that's great.
4885464	4886385	All right.
4886385	4888666	Do you think you might get one, DarkSakura?
4888666	4891367	Nah, Atari 400 is not really your jam.
4891367	4892547	Oh, I linked it to Dan.
4892547	4893688	It could happen.
4893688	4896369	I mean, I don't need one.
4896369	4897089	I'll be honest.
4897089	4900511	But also lately, I've been kind of focused in different areas.
4900511	4901371	Fair enough.
4902625	4905169	All right, well back to the current era.
4905169	4910636	Well, also, I have like most of those games on damn near 50,000.
4910636	4913260	A lot of those games were multi platform.
4913260	4916925	I'm trying to think of any of those games you named were like exclusive to the Atari 400.
4916925	4918407	And I really can't think of any.
4919088	4922809	Yes, so Suicide Squad, as you remember, it's been delayed to, well, this year.
4947355	4949797	because, well, it needed a lot of stuff reworked.
4949797	4963546	And one of the things that came out thanks to a RockStudio dev's kind of Q&A that they were doing on their Discord is some of the changes that they are making to the actual game mechanics.
4963546	4969970	One of those was a gear system that had like a gear score for each item.
4969970	4976514	So say you get a gun or whatever in the beginning of the game, you know, that gear score might be
4977455	4978156	Thank you for watching!
4993104	4994104	Playstyle, I guess.
4994104	4998046	You know, whatever you want to equip based off of your playstyle.
4998046	5002368	Which sounds to me a little bit more like how Borderlands does things, but it's still stats.
5002368	5007130	I mean, like, honestly, DPS and all that stuff, it's just looking at stats.
5007130	5010951	So that's one of the things that they've been tweaking with it.
5010951	5013152	The other stuff, I have no idea.
5013152	5015733	I'm not super excited about this game.
5015733	5017774	Like, honestly, it doesn't look great.
5019194	5021655	This game is not reading well.
5021655	5028837	And maybe the right trailer comes out, the right preview video that starts to change minds, and I'm going to hope for the developers' sake that's what happens.
5028837	5033538	Yeah, it feels very Crackdown to me.
5033538	5041720	Well, Crackdown 3, it feels very Crackdown 3, actually, to me, because Crackdown was... I loved Crackdown.
5041720	5042520	That was a great game.
5042520	5042680	I know.
5042680	5045881	Now that you said that, I'm like, Phil Spencer, we need to have a talk.
5046724	5050505	Yeah, Crackdown 3, though, just missed the mark.
5050505	5053566	Like, it wasn't as good as the other stuff.
5053566	5056467	Yeah, but that didn't stop them from trying to do another Saints Row game.
5056467	5058147	Why should it stop Crackdown?
5058147	5059108	No, it shouldn't.
5059108	5064249	And it was just that they kind of tweaked some stuff that just didn't work out.
5064249	5067430	So if they could do something, you know, it just feels...
5068533	5072335	I think the problem with the new Crackdown is it felt very generic.
5072335	5079018	Like, it felt like a very generic type of game, whereas the first couple Crackdowns felt kind of unique.
5079018	5081360	This feels very generic.
5081360	5087943	Like, I understand that, like, Rocksteady's got, you know, they got the good characters with DC and stuff, and I like Suicide Squad.
5087943	5089884	I think it's interesting.
5089884	5091825	It's just, they're...
5093001	5120935	really genericizing the whole thing like even going back to how it was originally where it's like okay yeah you've got Harley Quinn and all these you know characters from the Suicide Squad and we're gonna give them guns and we're gonna totally strip out anything that has to do with those individual characters like they don't have unique weapons or gameplay styles or anything like that they're all gonna be the same there's just gonna be different skins and that that's what makes it feel so generic because when people want to play like
5121295	5123098	I think that's what they missed the mark with.
5123098	5125561	I know they're trying to walk back to that, but...
5139784	5142848	They already have this shell of a game that they've made.
5142848	5147154	They're not going to drastically change up how that plays.
5147154	5149356	And it's just going to feel very generic.
5149356	5151199	I just don't think it's going to work out.
5151636	5158638	Yeah, SJ100Mad is pointing out in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, it's also the live service aspect that's kind of a big draw as well.
5158638	5168840	Stop, like with the live service games, like, you know, going back to the predictions, I think, I think one that the live service thing, I think one of these games turns to AI to try to fill it out.
5168840	5171421	And I think they get fucking blasted for it.
5171421	5175442	Well, here's the thing, like, um, here's this car crash happening in slow motion.
5176044	5188597	Right, so one of the, remember we talked about game leaks and stuff like that with Insomniac games or whatever, how their information leaked.
5188597	5195545	One of the things that leaked from that was a presentation that was given showing the number of players and time.
5196426	5219725	players spent on multiplayer versus single-player games and apparently single-player games have been players have been spending a lot more time in single-player games than multiplayer overall so that whole like oh no one plays single-player games anymore everyone needs to do live service things not true just companies like it because they can make a ton of money off of it that's it
5220757	5220777	I
5237682	5239243	Anyway, well, you know what?
5239243	5252575	Here's a story of a game that, you know, it was a game that just kind of literally came out of nowhere, and it did pretty amazing things, and now it's going to continue to do amazing things, which led to one of my predictions earlier.
5252575	5257760	Hi-Fi Rush, which of course came from Bethesda, which is part of an Xbox studio at this point,
5258320	5265262	It's coming to the Nintendo Switch if you would believe video game rating leaks, which are pretty good barometer, to be honest.
5265262	5266903	They oftentimes are true.
5266903	5271225	Well, the game was rated in Australia for the Nintendo Switch.
5271225	5274366	It was classified as M because it has fantasy violence.
5274366	5280088	We don't know when it is coming out, but don't we have like an Xbox Direct coming up soon?
5280968	5282829	or whatever they call that.
5282829	5286270	I mean, I guess they could announce it in a Nintendo thing instead of a Microsoft thing.
5286270	5287750	I could see it.
5287750	5288350	It'd be both.
5288350	5288830	It would be both.
5288830	5289511	I can see a switch.
5289511	5293652	The next Nintendo thing ought to be about the next Switch.
5293652	5296012	If it's not, I'm going to be very surprised.
5296012	5298973	And I will start to buy in more to Loki's theory about a 2025 successor.
5301975	5306300	But I could see them announcing it at a Microsoft thing.
5306300	5307001	We'll see.
5307001	5308062	But that's still really cool.
5308062	5310766	And you know, Hi-Fi Rush was a super cute game.
5310766	5313249	And yeah, it's interesting that we're talking about that.
5313249	5317334	By the way, it's interesting that we're talking about this about a year after that game came out.
5318786	5322368	It's almost like they have an exclusive window with themselves for a year or something.
5322368	5322708	I don't know.
5322708	5323869	Who knows?
5323869	5325770	Quest Buster says it's the 18th.
5325770	5326330	Thank you.
5326330	5329992	And the new Indiana Jones game is supposed to be talked about during the Direct 2.
5329992	5332073	So I wonder if we don't hear more about this on the 18th.
5332073	5336515	I wonder if it isn't a stealth release like the original was.
5336515	5338356	Maybe that's why it's leaking this way.
5338356	5339196	Who knows?
5339196	5340677	Who knows?
5340677	5341517	All right.
5341517	5348421	Well, we're going to get into our next segment, but I'm going to set this up a little bit before I play the bumper, because we need to explain
5349297	5355602	the 2024 twist to this segment, uh, for people that may have missed the original announcement, uh, several weeks ago.
5355602	5367890	So we do a segment here called the classic game of the week, but once a month, DarkSakura mixes up the formula and she does something a little different, like maybe a classic system or a classic peripheral or a soundtrack.
5367890	5372013	So this year, DarkSakura is mixing up the formula once again.
5372013	5378437	So before we get to the bumper and the actual choice, can you, can you set the stage DarkSakura, what is this year's theme?
5380011	5393095	These are cancelled games that were either almost all complete or mostly complete, or there are complete versions out there, but for some reason or another, they just didn't come out.
5393095	5394775	I think this is a fun theme.
5394775	5398817	I'm kind of surprised we didn't pick this one sooner, but it is what it is.
5398817	5404958	All right, so with that, I will play The Bump as I must, and we will get into the pick for this month.
5404958	5406899	So, Jamie, take it away, Jamie.
5417529	5425293	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5425293	5430096	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5430096	5432577	All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick this week?
5432577	5440281	And I will warn the viewers at Twitch, because these are canceled games, don't expect all-star quality footage for all of them.
5440281	5442122	I'm going to start off with that.
5442122	5442663	Exactly.
5443874	5449179	Yeah, it was what I could get.
5449179	5453283	The game I chose is Capcom Fighting All-Stars.
5453283	5460229	It is a cancelled 3D fighting game that was developed by Capcom for the arcade and the PlayStation 2.
5460229	5467336	It would have had characters from all kinds of different fighting games, including some SNK.
5468717	5475942	and it would have introduced some new characters.
5475942	5478664	So basically, I'll just go ahead a little bit.
5478664	5486909	It was trying to translate some mechanics from some of the 2D games into 3D, kind of how Street Fighter EX was.
5486909	5497917	You had three life bars that would, you know, pause each time one was depleted, kind of like how Darkstalkers goes, you know, where you, you know, have that, like, reset area.
5498938	5513734	And you have a combo gauge that if you're still on your first bar, you can only level it up to a lower tier, but the more beat up you are, the more damage you can do.
5513734	5515716	Of course you add finishing moves and whatnot.
5516377	5530423	So the characters, it was intended to have 16 playable characters, 11 from Capcom games, like Final Fight and Street Fighter series, and four originals and a guest character from King of Fighters.
5530423	5544290	So the list was Akira from Rival Schools, Akuma or Gouki from Street Fighter, Alex from Street Fighter, Street Fighter 3 series, Batsu from Rival Schools, Charlie from Street Fighter Alpha, Chun-Li,
5549391	5565420	Street Fighter, The You, Final Fight, Haggar, Dimitri from Darkstalkers, Kill from King of Fighters, Poison from Final Fight, and Strider Hiryu.
5566420	5572783	And then the original characters were DeeDee, Death, Luke, and Ingrid.
5572783	5578785	And of those, only Ingrid survived this game's demise.
5578785	5589790	So basically, in the story, there is a terrorist named Avel, who also used Death, who is trying to destroy Metro City with a small atomic bomb called the Laughter Sun.
5591571	5606458	And so you had to go fight these code holders who you would get the codes from to stop the bomb.
5606458	5607098	And this was...
5609159	5615403	sort of what had begun as a third Capcom vs. SNK.
5615403	5622128	But SNK cancelled it because, well, it actually was cancelled because of SNK facing bankruptcy.
5622128	5631474	And so 20 of their staff members went to go work for Capcom, including the director Tanabe Toyohisa.
5631474	5637378	So at any rate, they repurposed some of those assets into a new project that they called Capcom Fighting All-Stars.
5638338	5649165	and they were allowed to use Kyo with permission and a special guest.
5649165	5656830	And so they had some location tests between 2002 and 2003 and a lot of people left really negative feedback on the game.
5657750	5664415	They developed it a little bit more and then the game was cancelled in August 2003.
5664415	5681508	There isn't much of the game out there until 2017 when Capcom put out an interview with Tanabe on the Street Fighter V website and he let out a little bit more information about it and let out some unpublished artwork and screenshots.
5682388	5695859	So, this did, however, evolve into a different game aptly named Capcom Fighting Evolution in 2004, and it included Ingrid in its roster.
5695859	5707708	And then Ingrid showed up in other games such as Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max, Project X Zone 2, and as a costume for Karin in Street Fighter V.
5709670	5720575	Ingrid, DeeDee, and Luke also had cameos in the Rhythm RPG Ultaranger that was in 2013.
5720575	5722476	And so, there's the game.
5722476	5725097	So yeah, there were playable versions out there.
5725097	5732340	People have gotten to play this game, but I've seen no ROM dumps, no nothing about this.
5732340	5737723	This is one of those ones that's just lost in time, but was pretty much playable.
5738615	5742558	Yeah, you can see these folks location testing at one of these YouTubes here.
5742558	5746101	And it looks like it's a fairly done game.
5746101	5752406	I mean, maybe the I mean, I have to remember it's of the era because I'm like, well, the backgrounds look a little plain, but, you know, it's of that era.
5752406	5757951	So but it looks like it would have been fun.
5757951	5758911	Yeah, this was like 2002, 2003.
5758911	5759932	It was going through testing.
5759932	5762935	So consider that.
5762935	5763595	Sure.
5763595	5766958	This is I would reckon around the time of Tekken Tag Tournament.
5766958	5767178	Mm hmm.
5768462	5769983	You know, yeah.
5769983	5773284	Well, this is a this is a great way to start it off this year's theme.
5773284	5777145	And some folks in chat are like, oh, SJ100 Matt says, I didn't know about this at all.
5777145	5779406	D'Artesia said this was going to be CVS3.
5779406	5780526	Disappointed gasp.
5780526	5780947	Yeah.
5780947	5782967	So some interesting.
5782967	5784308	Yeah, this could have been cool.
5784308	5790110	It's interesting how some, you know, you kind of talked about how it did kind of evolve into something else like so.
5790110	5798033	And, you know, when I think about canceled games in recent memory, I think about Blizzard's Titan project and how that ultimately gave us Overwatch.
5798433	5805599	right so sometimes some very interesting ashes rise of you know these cancelled games so this this is fun so
5806308	5816752	Well, yeah, and we actually, we had had this on our radar to play because we knew certain individuals that worked at Capcom at the time.
5816752	5821113	And yeah, it just didn't happen.
5821113	5825635	But I mean, it's understandable with what happened with SNK.
5825635	5832037	I would believe that a Capcom versus SNK 3 would have turned out better.
5833334	5835836	then what was reported with this game.
5835836	5840239	This game had like there were a lot of complaints about how this went.
5840239	5841559	And I think it was a great concept.
5841559	5846923	And I'd love to see them revisit it because some of those other characters like DD looks pretty freaking cool.
5846923	5847623	Yeah.
5847623	5852226	I don't like the bomb, you know, aspect to it.
5852226	5858911	I'd just rather people get in there and beat each other up for the shit of it, you know, and maybe get whatever happened to just beating people up for fun.
5860027	5866709	and Ryu walking away going, the fight is all.
5866709	5869589	I am a little disappointed.
5869589	5875891	I would have liked to have seen what this could have been and have these characters come back.
5875891	5885813	Although, it would be cool if Capcom would revisit some of the other fighting game series and just do a complete all-star game that has every character.
5886892	5891715	from fighting games that they've made and beat-em-ups that they've made.
5891715	5903604	So we have the full DarkSakuras cast, we have the full Street Fighter cast, we have this game's cast, we just have, and we just call it Capcom All Out Fight.
5903604	5906066	DJ Rama S. Hey, Capcom, hire me.
5906066	5911469	DJ Rama S. just ran streaking through the building, screaming at the top of his lungs, Rival Schools 3.
5914031	5916834	Shiritsu Justice Daigakuen, which would be college.
5916834	5921339	Rival universities is not just Auburn versus Alabama anymore.
5936246	5940527	All right, let's cover some other quick headlines here before we get into whatever topic.
5940527	5942548	If you want to talk more about Rival Schools 3, that's fine.
5942548	5943768	We'll get to your topics in a little bit.
5943768	5949490	But first, let's do some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other headlines.
5949490	5951091	Loki, we'll start with you.
5951091	5956532	Yes, the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller is going to be getting an update soon.
5956532	5965235	Apparently, there's story listings talking about a V2 version, which is guests expected to have better battery life.
5966676	5973460	So that's cool, and it's gonna cost... looks like $89.99.
5973460	5979424	You can also get a charge station with click-and-charging.
5979424	5989850	According to Josh Hutcherson from Hunger Games, and of course Five Nights at Freddy's, saying that the sequel is getting underway
5991684	5993705	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6015257	6020720	We have some interesting news out there.
6020720	6022961	Some more Toaplan stuff.
6022961	6025242	Because you know I like my Toaplan.
6025242	6039770	So Batsugun, Fixate, TigerHeli, and Vimana are coming to PC on February 1st with the Toaplan Arcade Shoot-'em-up Collection Volume 3!
6039770	6041931	I love TigerHeli and Batsugun.
6043552	6048358	So yeah, it's going to be out on Steam and GOG.
6048358	6049680	The Goggle.
6049680	6054506	That's what I'm going to call it from now on because I'm cool and I can make up nicknames for things.
6054506	6057911	It's an industry privilege!
6057911	6058251	There you go.
6061042	6067444	All right, let's see, I got one for you as well, talking a little bit about limited run games.
6067444	6072486	I know some folks look forward to the things that they put out, and these are some very interesting re-releases for Switch.
6072486	6077748	So we have the Felix the Cat Collection, which will have the NES and the Game Boy games.
6077748	6080929	Remember when Felix the Cat was a game on the... Felix the Cat?
6080929	6082890	Wonderful, wonderful cat.
6082890	6086571	What was the thing, whenever he gets into a fix, he reaches into his bag of tricks?
6087497	6088338	Something like that.
6088338	6090200	It's been a long time since I've seen it.
6090200	6095367	But there will be a standard edition and a classic edition that has the CD soundtrack and a poster and all this good stuff.
6097904	6103927	Let's see, also the Rocket Knight Adventures Resparked Collection is coming as well.
6103927	6111270	So that will be coming in a standard and classic edition, which I think there's even like a super classic edition or something like that.
6111270	6118053	So the pre-orders for Felix the Cat start on February 9th and will run for about a month until March 10th.
6118053	6122975	And Rocket Knight Adventures opens in just a few days on January 19th and ends on March 3rd.
6123815	6129017	So some early limited run stuff to kick off the year.
6129017	6135639	If that is not soon enough for you, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner in some world release dates.
6135639	6136379	Yep.
6136379	6140820	Well, we don't have a lot coming out this week, but there are a few things.
6140820	6145942	So starting off, we've got Dread Out 2 for Nintendo Switch.
6145942	6152284	Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6154225	6174324	Yuna and the Haunted Hot Springs, The Thrilling Steamy Maze, Kiwami PC, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 Code Recollection on Nintendo Switch Last but not least, The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PlayStation 5
6179395	6186318	Let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases that are coming out over there this week.
6186318	6193581	I guess the year is really starting to pick up now with releases, because Last of Us Part II Remastered is a pretty big one for some people.
6195262	6196243	Prince of Persia The Lost Crown
6211331	6212652	Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles, PlayStation 5
6234190	6238292	Prince of Persia The Lost Crown Endless Dungeon Last Wish Remastered Ghostrunner 2 Touhou Luna Nights
6256381	6257582	I'm sorry, that's next week.
6257582	6257982	My bad.
6257982	6259223	That's next week.
6259223	6264787	So I guess you just have to play Prince of Persia and Last of Us 2 until we get to next week's releases.
6264787	6268329	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
6268329	6273692	On the 18th, for the big three consoles, we have Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown.
6273692	6278855	On the 19th, for PlayStation, we have The Last of Us 2 Remastered.
6278855	6281877	For Switch, we have another code, Recollection.
6281877	6282758	And that's it.
6284506	6286927	Alright, it's nice to have release dates again.
6286927	6289068	All right, we have a few more headlines for you.
6289068	6290708	And then we're going to open it up for you guys.
6290708	6293029	If you either want to call or ask us questions in chat.
6293029	6298471	We also have the mailbag, although I sadly think it's another empty week, but we'll look anyway.
6298471	6300292	But first, a couple stories for you.
6300292	6301452	We'll start with Loki.
6302763	6309207	Yeah, because CES is going on this week, so of course we're going to see a lot of weird things out of CES.
6309207	6315952	And one of those is a project between Sony and Honda called Aphelia.
6315952	6324177	It's an electric car that has the option to drive it via a DualSense controller.
6325549	6327790	I would not feel safe doing that.
6327790	6335295	Other fun things along with that, though, is they also have an Unreal Engine AR dash.
6335295	6337316	It's powered by Unreal.
6337316	6341739	They have in the example, like a monster running down the street as you're driving your car.
6341739	6343620	That sounds distracting.
6343620	6346282	And then also there's a full dash that you can scan.
6346282	6351525	It's like a big wide screen that takes up the entire dash that has
6353390	6358393	like heads up displays for different like games and stuff in there.
6358393	6362836	Once again, very distracting for drivers as if it wasn't already a problem.
6362836	6375504	I feel like they're like a fucking YouTube where somebody modded their I don't know their fucking Tesla or something to run off a PlayStation controller for the LOLs and now somebody thought that would make a good idea IRL like Gran Turismo is not real life.
6375504	6377605	Like I know it's it's very realistic.
6377605	6380667	But let's let's remember that racing games are not real life.
6380667	6382548	And well, yeah, we shouldn't be real life.
6383048	6393952	And I think a lot of that is, once again, this is probably concept car, and concept cars don't necessarily end up like this, or even come out, for that matter.
6393952	6397913	Oh, like the self-driving cars?
6397913	6400154	Yeah.
6400154	6408337	So, I mean, just because it has, like, controller and support and stuff like that doesn't mean that, like, you'd be able to actually do that.
6408337	6411858	And also, doesn't mean it's actually ever going to come out.
6411858	6412018	So...
6413032	6415454	We'll see if it ever happens.
6415454	6430905	There's also like I feel like the C and the S in CES often stands for crazy shit because you see a lot of just wild stuff that's never going to come out or it's it's very conceptual or it's the whole like we're doing this because we can.
6430905	6433247	Like who needs a 200 inch TV?
6433247	6438071	We're doing it because we can, you know, or maybe it's, you know, getting installed at a Dave and Buster somewhere.
6438071	6439792	It's not really for mass consumption.
6439792	6440733	There are some pretty cool.
6441153	6442734	wild shit at CES sometimes.
6442734	6448276	Yeah, there's some like pretty cool stuff like they had like transparent displays and stuff like that that were really cool looking.
6448276	6450077	But also, yeah, there is a lot of weird stuff.
6450077	6459122	I don't know if you saw like the whole AARP or I don't even know who was a AI company that was doing stuff with AARP or Target or something like that.
6459122	6469927	And they had like a virtual Mario that they clearly didn't license and was like showing how an AI avatar can answer questions in like a retail setting or something like that.
6470507	6475872	Unfortunately, they got their wires crossed and Ben Starr was doing the voice of this Mario.
6475872	6478914	It's a me, Mario.
6478914	6480836	Are you retiring soon?
6480836	6483559	Do you want deals at Denny's?
6483559	6485921	Are you ready for the senior menu at Denny's?
6485921	6489464	It would have been better than whatever like voice they ended up with.
6489464	6492707	But yeah, it's it's like stuff like that.
6492707	6494348	Like it's like, oh, that's just wrong.
6494348	6496170	But OK, you know, well,
6497731	6500474	We can do it, I guess, so we're going to show it off.
6500474	6502196	It's proof in concept.
6502196	6507903	It's more about the concept and what you think it's worth versus what it actually is and the practical uses for it.
6509179	6510699	Uh, RinClarity is in chat.
6510699	6511040	Hello.
6511040	6511580	Welcome back.
6511580	6512400	It's good to see you.
6512400	6517822	Uh, and offers this comment saying, um, my opinion on car entertainment devices.
6517822	6520222	Can I play music from my smartphone on it?
6520222	6520762	Yes.
6520762	6522103	Then that's good enough.
6522103	6523503	No, exactly that.
6523503	6533786	All I need, all I need is to be able to blast music from either DDR or the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack as I'm going a godly speed down the I-5.
6533786	6535847	That's, that's all I need.
6538504	6540085	Anyway, yeah.
6540085	6540505	All right.
6540505	6544986	So let's just hope this PlayStation driving car really goes nowhere.
6544986	6545647	I don't.
6545647	6551229	Yeah, I'm pretty certain that it's not like the only car that you could control with a controller.
6551229	6560132	But like they had, they've seen a lot of the other ones I've seen have been remote controlled vehicles that children drive through the park with the giant antenna.
6560132	6563613	That's that's what the PlayStation controller cars ought to be.
6564932	6576937	I'm just like, well, first off, there's like, it's just, it's a bad idea in a lot of sense, because like, okay, let's say I'm disabling my steering wheel to use my controller to drive my car.
6576937	6581919	Bluetooth controllers get disconnected every once in a while for just no reason whatsoever.
6581919	6585261	So that's not great.
6585261	6587522	Like I'm driving down the freeway.
6587522	6590583	Oh, can't steer anymore.
6590583	6590963	All right.
6590963	6592484	That sucks.
6592484	6594205	Well, you have one more story for us, right, Loki?
6595666	6605903	Yeah, and then of course there's a new handheld Sega Genesis system coming out from a Hyperkin, which looks kind of cool.
6605903	6606944	I'm not really sure.
6606944	6609368	It's like a extra fat
6610359	6615062	Game Gear, which, I mean the Game Gear is already pretty fat as it was.
6615062	6619604	So this is the Mega Retron HD.
6619604	6622025	Mega Retron HD is their popular thing.
6622025	6626167	Right now this is going to be called the Mega 95.
6626167	6633451	And the system is going to, of course, like a Retron, plays a lot of different things.
6634992	6646716	So this one, they have a USB-C dock that allows you to charge it as well, Mega Drive controller ports, and also out ports to HDMI in case you want to play on your TV.
6646716	6651897	They haven't announced a price or release date for that.
6651897	6653458	And then there's also...
6655936	6657737	Let's see here.
6657737	6662901	They also have their previous Retron HD which has Mega Drive support on it already.
6662901	6665343	So this I guess would be like a portable system for them.
6668427	6670008	Cool?
6670008	6670929	I don't know.
6670929	6675213	I don't think the Hyperkin stuff's been all that super great.
6675213	6677655	It's an okay emulation, I guess, of it.
6677655	6684420	Yeah, and I feel like, obviously, these retro devices are, like, everywhere now at this point.
6684420	6688844	Well, this one actually takes cartridges, though, which is kind of unique, I guess.
6688844	6689905	But I don't know.
6689905	6690826	But it's an emulation.
6691246	6693849	RingClarity in chat says I had the Hyperkin NES Famicom clone and I didn't like it too much.
6693849	6695792	The main unit is bulky and the controllers aren't well built.
6710709	6713792	Well, that was all of the slotted stories we had for tonight.
6713792	6716314	So I do want to open it up to our listeners.
6716314	6719737	If you have anything you'd like to ask us about or have us talk about tonight, we can do that.
6719737	6726863	You can also call in if you want over at discord vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord and hop in the green room.
6726863	6733809	And as long as I recognize you as somebody that's participated with the show in some element, we'll bring you I just want to avoid trolls.
6733809	6738813	We also like to check in with our mailbag participate at orange laundry.com if you want to send us an email.
6739333	6742675	DarkSakura, did we get anything?
6742675	6745656	I honestly forgot to pull it up.
6745656	6747157	I don't think anything was in there.
6747157	6749818	I think I looked a couple of days ago and I haven't seen anything coming since.
6749818	6752039	So yeah, I'll give it a look.
6752039	6752439	Hold on.
6752439	6757841	Yeah, I know we missed one a couple of weeks ago, so I hate to miss it again, but I'm pretty sure it was empty.
6757841	6759622	It was empty last week.
6759622	6760963	Yeah.
6760963	6761083	So.
6762837	6765739	Hey, I'm looking, I'm trying to get it to load up.
6765739	6770241	Well, while DarkSakura fires that up, let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
6770241	6772442	I have so many last minute stories.
6772442	6775364	It's just like, it's it's been, yeah, it's like that.
6775364	6785709	So let's start off with the the first announcement that was surprising, yet not surprising, because the numbers from this game have been dwindling ever since the launch week.
6785709	6786569	And that was
6788050	6794892	Microsoft, Mojang, I can't remember the studio that actually works on this game, but they are... Nothing, by the way.
6794892	6799234	They are no longer developing Minecraft Legends anymore.
6799234	6800814	They're basically cancelling that game.
6800814	6801634	That didn't take long.
6801634	6802775	Jesus.
6802775	6803955	Nine months.
6803955	6806896	It didn't even last a whole year.
6806896	6808697	So they've stopped development for that game.
6808697	6812638	They're going to be continuing in maintenance mode, and that's it.
6812638	6814158	No more updates, no nothing.
6816199	6819320	outside of bug fixes or whatever patches they have to do for that.
6819320	6821041	So there's that.
6821041	6830545	Then you have Billy Mitchell settling his lawsuit with, I believe it was Twin Galaxies.
6830545	6835447	So that's been going on for a while.
6835447	6837868	Four years, apparently.
6837868	6841850	So, there is a lot of evidence against him.
6841850	6842470	So, I mean,
6843470	6847038	I just, I just don't fucking care anymore.
6847038	6852289	Like, can't the world move on beyond Billy Mitchell and his weave?
6852289	6853793	Like, just yeah, let's move on.
6856072	6857573	But thank you for bringing it up.
6857573	6858514	I'm not blaming you.
6858514	6861656	I realize it's the greater gaming community.
6861656	6867179	YouTube commentators have a huge boner to make 70 minute videos just destroying him.
6867179	6874604	But I'm just like, can't we as society move on from a 60 year old man who wears synthetic hair?
6874604	6876185	Like, can't we move on from that?
6877847	6880448	Yeah.
6880448	6892793	And then I saw something that there was originally speculation that GameShark was leaking out a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2.
6892793	6895234	Oh, I did hear about this.
6895234	6901257	Which they said, which they were basically said, oh, no, we were just guessing what the date was going to be.
6901257	6904318	For me, the bigger news is GameShark still around?
6905879	6908660	Like, that's still a thing.
6908660	6915285	Apparently they have a GameShark AI successor.
6915285	6924331	I have no idea what this is, but like, I was just like, wow, that's still a thing.
6924331	6928013	In all seriousness, this thing is just called the GameShark AI because that's the cool term.
6928013	6929314	It literally has no AI in it.
6930813	6933319	I'm just guessing, hypothetically.
6933319	6937150	AI stands for we're going all in on buzzwords.
6937150	6937511	All in.
6940031	6953482	You know, yeah, here's the thing, GameShark, I'm actually willing to believe it was probably just placeholder text, because sometimes placeholder text accidentally gets made live.
6953482	6966393	And I'm actually willing to believe it, because what I'm not willing to believe is that Nintendo had a meeting with a company they've never liked to tell them when the successor to the Switch was coming out.
6966393	6967474	No, that would never happen.
6970615	6973380	It would be sharing them any information whatsoever.
6973380	6977947	And if it does get announced for September, then it was a lucky fucking guess.
6977947	6980952	But I don't... a September console release.
6980952	6983076	That's what our AI told us.
6983076	6983737	So, you know.
6985971	6986371	I don't know.
6986371	6992773	I'm still I'm still all about the switch successor coming out like summer like just do it doing a non some non standard shit.
6992773	6994133	Why not?
6994133	6995814	We'll see.
6995814	6999815	I really hope in the next like month.
6999815	7003356	I want to stop like talking about the switch successor and hypotheticals.
7003356	7004776	I'm getting really sick of it.
7004776	7011558	So like in the next month, I really hope Nintendo pulls back the curtain on this a little bit but wishful thinking ain't gonna make it true.
7011558	7014299	I know.
7014299	7014579	All right.
7016245	7025273	Sia Tabiri in chat says, GameShark made a wish on Game Genie to last forever.
7025273	7031218	Tiger Claw points out if GameShark is around, maybe they are useful for those retro consoles.
7031218	7036121	Some of, I want to say, didn't one of the retrons have like either Game Genie or GameShark?
7036121	7037483	One of those codes were like built into it.
7037483	7041506	Yeah, because it's basically those codes represented certain hex
7043747	7044948	values like in memory.
7044948	7048271	So like that's just it's a standardized format basically.
7048271	7056078	So yeah, you could, in a sense, program in your own cheat codes in there and save it into a library.
7056078	7069489	That was like one of my most favorite things to do with MAME is download like the cheats file that you can, you know, basically have GameShark type codes, Game Genie type codes in all these different arcade games.
7069489	7070870	That was fun.
7070870	7071831	That was a lot of fun.
7074567	7083013	In chat, I'm looking at a comment that came in from Orange Right that said, considering the original Switch came out in March, they don't have to wait until winter or even fall.
7083013	7086655	And no, that's absolutely true, but I keep thinking that's way too soon.
7086655	7095040	And I'm actually trying to remember, when did they actually announce the original Switch, which released worldwide on March 3rd?
7095040	7100663	And I'm trying to remember, what day did they announce it?
7100663	7101964	I'm looking quickly.
7103405	7104546	Let's see.
7104546	7114255	Oh, Nintendo revealed technical details of the Switch, including the launch date and price at a press event in Tokyo on January 13th, 2017.
7114255	7120761	So we are past that day, but I'm going I'm going back in time.
7120761	7122863	Everybody get in the time.
7122863	7123803	Get in the time machine.
7123803	7126686	We're going shopping.
7126686	7129769	January 13th was a Friday.
7131308	7133675	but it was the Friday before Martin Luther King weekend.
7135899	7136019	in 2017.
7167598	7174323	They've been pretty good about keeping their releases pretty secret for the most part.
7174323	7180808	We don't really know a lot of games far out that are going to be coming anytime soon.
7180808	7183510	With Nintendo, they don't really announce that stuff right away.
7185211	7185391	I think
7209102	7209342	about
7234201	7240986	Yeah, and SSJ100mat says, I think they pushed that new Metroid Prime game for this new thing as the release game.
7240986	7244049	I actually, I'm going to say it's not a release game.
7244049	7248392	I'm going to think it's the holiday game because it doesn't release at the holidays.
7248392	7252115	So I think it's pretty soon, but it's not the release game.
7252115	7254818	I think a big part of the release, quite honestly,
7255538	7260740	I think they're going to try to move with early adopters just based on the existing Switch library.
7260740	7270223	I think one of the most attractive things about the Switch successor, they're going to come out and they're going to say, Pokemon Gen 9 runs, runs acceptably on it.
7270223	7273244	They won't use those words, but that will be the impression.
7273244	7277706	Pokemon Gen 9 runs decently on it.
7277706	7280127	That's pathetic, if that's the case.
7280127	7282588	Like, oh yeah, we developed it with another system in mind.
7282588	7282928	It's like,
7284298	7285819	Yeah, they didn't come out until years later.
7285819	7304215	There will be a Mario, there will be something, but the real, the real bread and butter game for the Switch 2, the real, Mario Kart 9 will be the real, or if rumors are to be believed, they're doing the Windows thing and going to Mario Kart 10.
7304215	7306237	I don't remember why that rumor was going around.
7306237	7308359	It was something to do with like Mario Kart X or something.
7308359	7311762	But whatever Mario Kart's future is, that's,
7312202	7313423	the fucking game.
7313423	7322707	I mean, technically, if you want to get super technical, technically, it would be the 10th game because you're right, you're right.
7322707	7324108	Yeah, World Circuit was nine.
7324108	7325448	Yeah.
7325448	7332572	So which is stupid, though, but like, yeah, well, yeah, which pretty much that whole game's just been ported his tracks into eight deluxe, which whatever fine.
7334929	7337230	I mean, a new Mario Kart game would be cool.
7337230	7349938	I don't see them necessarily doing the same game plan as the Switch one, because that's what they did with Switch, is they ported 8 from the Wii U and had that.
7349938	7350699	I could see them
7352129	7352930	there.
7352930	7355052	No, this is not even a prediction.
7355052	7367282	This is like, like, I would go so far as to root this in fact, there will be a Mario Kart successor game on the Switch successor sooner rather than later, because that is the fucking money printer.
7367282	7367922	Like, look,
7368763	7372806	Mario Kart 8 is still a top seller to this day.
7372806	7382614	They would be fools not to release a Mario Kart 10 or even if nothing else, they're going to they're going to rehash Mario Kart 8 one more time.
7382614	7383394	Watch.
7383394	7387417	They're going to put out and it'll be a launch title for the Switch to Switch successor.
7387417	7397065	It'll be Mario Kart 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, everything, the whole fucking pack with everything they've released, all the DLCs, everything in one cartridge.
7398001	7403064	and that'll be the swan song for 8 to hold us over for about a year until Mario Kart 10 actually happens.
7403064	7411029	It'll be another, what their launch game will be, the big launch title is gonna be another Wii remaster game.
7411029	7416193	It'll be Super Mario Galaxy HD, something like that.
7417561	7421424	I would like to, I think an Odyssey sequel makes so much sense.
7421424	7423726	And I hope I would love to see an Odyssey.
7423726	7425008	I hope that's what it is.
7425008	7431554	I would love to see a Mario Odyssey sequel as the launch game that that should have had trust.
7431554	7434496	It should have had trust in it as a mini game.
7434496	7434997	That'd be fun.
7436778	7439641	Oh, I did want to mention as a random aside thing.
7439641	7443664	I don't remember if I mentioned it when we were talking about why I have Clockwork Knight in the background.
7443664	7451771	There was a cheat code that was unveiled that apparently the first Clockwork Knight game was hiding in the second Clockwork Knight game.
7451771	7453353	Oh, you can play the full game, huh?
7454844	7457706	What's up with all these old-ass cheat codes coming to light?
7457706	7462890	Because we had the one about the alien PlayStation game that just, like, fucking unlocks your hardware.
7462890	7466313	Unlocks the fucking hardware to play anything.
7466313	7469095	Like, just coming to light 20-plus years later.
7469095	7470316	I love it.
7470316	7470696	I love it.
7472521	7473322	DJRamaS
7493988	7501538	Yeah, the best that they've done recently with Luigi, aside from Luigi's Mansion games, is the new Luigi U. He had his game for a while.
7501538	7505424	Yeah, or, well, I mean, he's also in that, you know, Super Mario Wonder.
7505424	7508568	He's still Mario's brother in that game, so.
7509736	7511358	Anyway, all right.
7511358	7514020	Well, with that, we're going to go around and wrap up for tonight.

7559014	7565636	Um, my final thought is fact check before you repost.
7565636	7567516	I will, I will do my best.
7567516	7568616	All right.
7568616	7569696	Uh, thank you, DarkSakura.
7569696	7570197	Have a good stream.
7570197	7571737	We'll see you in a minute.
7571737	7572477	All right.
7572477	7574698	Loki, we'll go to you with your final thought.
7574698	7576238	What's your final thought tonight?
7576238	7577498	I have to get to some editing.
7577498	7583720	I'm like, I've realized I've been, I haven't released a video in like 24 days.
7583720	7584680	It has been a hot minute.
7585262	7589465	Yeah, I've just been putting off editing, I think.
7589465	7591526	I also have lots of big projects.
7591526	7593667	So, I've got pretty much this next video.
7593667	7594828	It's almost ready to go.
7594828	7596649	It's already mostly edited.
7596649	7601612	I just have to put in the last, like, 30 minutes into it.
7601612	7602493	So, we'll do that.
7602493	7606055	And then I have a big build coming on the Fever Dream SMP.
7606055	7609958	So, all the materials are pretty much gathered on that.
7609958	7611158	And so, that's gonna be coming.
7611158	7611459	That'll...
7612379	7624403	Um, it'll be a different type of video because it's satirizing, um, the younger generation, like type of editing where it's just like, Hey guys, what's up?
7624403	7625044	It's your boy.
7625044	7627565	You know, like that type of annoying stuff.
7627565	7632706	Cause the whole thing's supposed to take place in a nightmare for my character or me or whatever.
7632706	7635487	So it's like... Watch it be your most viewed video.
7635487	7636648	I know it's...
7638217	7640659	It does feature a very popular meme.
7640659	7649063	In fact, actually, the build theme on this SMP is memes.
7649063	7665913	So it has... I have a 75,000 block build I'm doing, and then another smaller 25,000 block build I'm doing, both regarding giant memes, and then I'm supposed to have other stuff I build around it, but that's what's planned so far.
7665913	7666734	So, yeah.
7668735	7670175	All right.
7670175	7673156	Let's see my final thought tonight.
7673156	7680459	My new favorite thing to do on Facebook is when I get those fucking clickbait headlines that are that are that are advertisements.
