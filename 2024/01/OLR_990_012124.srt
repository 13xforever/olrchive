1
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:15,527
[SPEAKER_02]: The unsung hero of modern music gaming, Groove Coaster, joins the arcade score tracking graveyard.

2
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:21,691
[SPEAKER_02]: The game isn't going away yet, but your play history, save customizations, items, and online multiplayer will starting in April.

3
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a shutdown to make that game's unlock system less awful.

4
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:26,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny how that works.

5
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:28,535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just one of tonight's Music Game Updates.

6
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:34,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rubber Upperts Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this, the other Music Game Update, and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting right now on the show, wherever your gamer has a voice,

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:47,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:55,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 990 of our program for tonight.

11
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:59,413
[SPEAKER_06]: January the 21st of 2024.

12
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:08,339
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week to talk about what is going on in video games and gaming culture with all of you live in chat and all of the world through our podcast feed.

13
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, I could not do it without my co hosts.

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:15,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

16
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

17
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:17,044
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

18
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:30,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my COVID shot, which everyone needs to make sure that they have their COVID vaccine unless they have allergies or a medically prescribed reason why they cannot.

19
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:36,565
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have other underlying conditions that means it kicked my ass.

20
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:37,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It kicked my ass a lot.

21
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,627
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's hitting you so hard, it's screwing up your video as well.

22
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:45,048
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's, hey, what else?

23
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:45,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on my side.

24
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:46,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

25
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:46,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.

26
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,088
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an episode of OLR.

27
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:50,729
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is at least a little bit of tech fail, what can you do?

28
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So all right, there we go there.

29
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,170
[SPEAKER_06]: There's there's our little VTuber in the Super Metroid.

30
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,511
[SPEAKER_06]: The last VTuber is in captivity.

31
00:01:58,511 --> 00:01:59,591
[SPEAKER_06]: The galaxy is at peace.

32
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:03,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I just turn it off and on again.

33
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a great way to fix IT problems.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you.

35
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,382
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

36
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:12,184
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I 90% of the time have to tell people to do every freaking day.

37
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:13,445
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

38
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:16,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be coming back to you in just a moment for our kickoff topic tonight.

39
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:24,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm sure folks that are watching us live, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv.

40
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:29,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

41
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:31,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks that are watching live are probably going, hey, wait a minute.

42
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:32,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki looks a little different this week.

43
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:33,817
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on over there?

44
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:34,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

45
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:35,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki's a shapeshifter.

46
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

47
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the thing.

48
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our special guest Mystique.

49
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:42,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki has a kid.

50
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the kiddos has a birthday today.

51
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, family is priority for him.

52
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,146
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't blame him at all.

53
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's off doing stuff with the kids.

54
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where they want to get taken today.

55
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So we decided to invite a guest host on.

56
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guest host is going to be completely familiar to all of you.

57
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,393
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's called into the show many times.

58
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:03,916
[SPEAKER_06]: He hosts his own podcast here at The Voice Geeks Network with some of his friends called Anime Jam Session.

59
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,938
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, of course, the one and only DJ Ranma S. Hey, Ranma.

60
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, Rob?

61
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,439
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

62
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I am doing fantastic.

63
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for agreeing to be here.

64
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for doing this.

65
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate you.

66
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:16,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

67
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:20,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want you to know when I got that text, I almost dropped my phone out of my hand.

68
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:21,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, wait, what?

69
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,327
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

70
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:27,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's let's be clear, Loki can never be replaced.

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,394
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's not often we get a lot of notice.

72
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually if a host isn't here, it's because somebody's sick.

73
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So usually we'll just kind of make it a two person show.

74
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:36,899
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what it is.

75
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: But we had enough notice this week.

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, Wait a minute, Rama wanted to talk about a recent trip that he took.

77
00:03:43,184 --> 00:04:02,545
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of the picture well you know we'll get into that a little bit because you took went on a really big trip and you have some insights to gaming culture and some things as a result of this so it is still a video game thing but we're gonna talk about that in a minute and I was like why doesn't he just freaking come on for the show we have a chair open let's do it so here we are we're in this virtual thing now you don't have to come to my house to be on the show

78
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:05,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Anime Jam Session, as I like to call it, is a 90 minute show where you have me,

79
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:39,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Mako-chan and Ari will re-talk about some of the topics and information of what's going on in the anime industry, whether it's in the U.S.

80
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:58,786
[SPEAKER_05]: or Japan, find out what's going on with upcoming conventions and the culture, and we kind of take our little spin on it, and usually we have one doing color commentary, one going on outlandish, and then there's the straight guy, me, like, we kind of need to calm this together, until I get an article and I'm just like, what is this?

81
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:10,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's just basically us discussing what's going on, and just trying to give our spin, our thoughts on it, from going to conventions over the last, I'd say, several years.

82
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to a lot of conventions.

83
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:19,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're not listening to Anime Jams, you don't understand how many conventions that show covers, because you're very well-traveled on the East Coast.

84
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sometimes the West Coast, mostly the East Coast, you know.

85
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:25,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I use somewhere on my computer.

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,942
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a Excel spreadsheet by year.

87
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single convention that I've attended since I started.

88
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:33,366
[SPEAKER_05]: That's smart.

89
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I'd done something like that.

90
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:35,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to go back and think now.

91
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,200
[SPEAKER_05]: about five, I think about five, six years ago, I hit like the 150 mark.

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just like, Oh, wow.

93
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That's impressive.

94
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:44,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's awesome.

95
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um, make no mistake.

96
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody Rama's playing the role of the host tonight.

97
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,165
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to help us with stories and all of that stuff.

98
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:56,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get to that in a little bit, but we want to get to our kickoff topic tonight because boy, oh boy, it's so funny.

99
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week we did the predictions episode.

100
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:05,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody could have predicted this game comes out of fricking nowhere and has just

101
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

102
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:47,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, it's a little bit more like some of those survival games, but the big battle system with your little creatures is pretty obvious.

103
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,592
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Pokemon Dark.

104
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no turn-based battle system.

105
00:06:52,094 --> 00:07:15,430
[SPEAKER_06]: which is kind of but I mean I'm not like I get where the issues are because it's it's the look that's that's causing a lot of the controversy but I do think it's important to say it's a survival game first and instead of like let's say Lego Lego Fortnite and chickens instead of the chickens it's these may or may not be skirting the line of legally different from Pokemon

106
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I refuse to support it since they use AI for their character designs, and I also will not support plagiarism.

107
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:50,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's allegedly, but there's plenty of discussion from PocketPear's CEO going back to 2022 where he talks about generative AI tools being sophisticated enough to avoid copyright issues.

108
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:58,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another one in 2021 where they were showing how AI could be used to generate new Pokemon designs.

109
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:19,670
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's way too much evidence, and especially in the teams that were created for the creation of this game, very inexperienced designers.

110
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:31,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people who were amateurs in their fields who are bringing in on this professional product and

111
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:50,311
[SPEAKER_01]: including the fact that, I mean, now I'm not going to be disparaging on this one because they're saying that they had a graduate student who did a hundred of the character concepts.

112
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:55,777
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she applied to all these companies and failed, but now she's apparently drawing the characters.

113
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a talented artist could do all that.

114
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:05,246
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely, absolutely fine.

115
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:14,933
[SPEAKER_01]: But if if she's also bringing in AI to do this work, she'd have to do it with company's knowledge.

116
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:26,922
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is more than just like I was looking at the designs, this is more than just a passing similarity, like, you know, an art style tribute.

117
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And Questbuster got to my next point.

118
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't jump the gun.

119
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

120
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, remember the podcasters can't read chat.

121
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

122
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:45,004
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are also they had another game on Steam called AI Art Imposter.

123
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:45,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So

124
00:09:51,064 --> 00:10:04,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that AI has a big part to do with these designs and the fact that it is, like I said, it's more than a passing resemblance to Pokemon.

125
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:09,332
[SPEAKER_01]: There are way too many similarities for it to be coincidence.

126
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,453
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

127
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:20,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they took Pokemon as a concept and then stole another concept from another game and made their own game.

128
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I have some complex thoughts on this.

129
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Very complex thoughts.

130
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:30,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm gonna say up front- I'm not capable of complexity tonight.

131
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:31,985
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's obvious.

132
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Ranma.

133
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can say, I have played the game.

134
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I put at least about an hour into the game.

135
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:42,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about this through normal means.

136
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard someone, it was basically like, Pokemon with guns.

137
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:45,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like,

138
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,319
[SPEAKER_05]: go on.

139
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:52,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I go and I download it, and I start playing this game.

140
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:01,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell already, I'm not gonna be really big into it, because I'm not really into the type of games where you have to build and construct everything in order to survive.

141
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:05,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only played a couple of those games, and I'm not really good at them.

142
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:13,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it would be more like Borderlands 3, where you get dropped right in, here's your weapon, here's your equipment, go, go, go, go.

143
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:14,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoot, hunt, this, all of that.

144
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:30,767
[SPEAKER_05]: While I was at the laundromat today someone made a mention about AI being connected to this game and then I went digging on Twitter and seeing the similarities and the accusations at that point I just uninstalled the game because the field that I'm in

145
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:36,583
[SPEAKER_05]: AI can kinda mess with my job, my livelihood.

146
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:45,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, I'm way far up the ladder, but still, it's a chain effect if AI gets more and more into what I do.

147
00:11:48,254 --> 00:12:08,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also spent a few hours with the game and I kind of got turned on to it because of well the fact that it's on Game Pass and you know then everybody it was kind of the same thing I heard like what it's like a 4k Pokemon what is going on and people are going nuts about it all right let me install this and figure out what's going on and I had that's kind of the same takeaway as my first thought I was like this isn't Pokemon

148
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:19,133
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a survival game that's using the Pokémon kind of shtick as sort of a mechanic within the game, and specifically Pokémon Legends, which I think is important to say.

149
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, there's no turn-based battles in the game, and even, you know, which is the core element of a Pokémon game.

150
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:28,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but, but, I mean, here's, here's the thing at the end of the day.

151
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's two different issues going here.

152
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:34,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's two very different issues going on with this game.

153
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are two, I feel two different ways about them.

154
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I say my feelings are complex.

155
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:47,853
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the issues is this talk about AI, and what the CEO has said about AI in the past, and the track record of what else the company has released, and some of these other things.

156
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:51,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm that's actually not enough evidence for me.

157
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:58,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm gonna I'm gonna explain why because we just had a talk on this show a couple weeks ago about Square Enix.

158
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:07,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was an article about Square Enix and the CEO actually went out and said, we're going to be aggressive with using AI for development.

159
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to use AI to develop these games and do these things.

160
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:15,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, obviously now we have these issues with FoamStars, which we'll talk about later and so forth.

161
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:25,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what it really boils down to is the issue with AI is that most of us get pissed off when we see AI art ripped off.

162
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the part that pisses us off.

163
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:29,228
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using AI for map generation,

164
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:39,661
[SPEAKER_06]: for enemy stuff for automating textures in your game to help turn around HD graphics that's been trained on your own process and your own thing.

165
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:45,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I think generally, the public doesn't have an issue with that it's AI art that they have a problem with.

166
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,278
[SPEAKER_06]: which leads to the second issue.

167
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:54,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So with AI, again, also, one of the things I want to say on that with AI is that Steam has a policy.

168
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,428
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another thing that we've talked about in the past couple weeks.

169
00:13:56,428 --> 00:14:03,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam came out with a policy and said, our publishers, if they want to be on the store, they have to disclose that they're using AI in their game.

170
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:09,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's a report button to report if you suspect that that's a thing that's being used.

171
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:16,555
[SPEAKER_06]: This is right now, like one of the most ever, like it's up there with Baldur's Gate 3, with how freaking popular it is on Steam right now.

172
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:21,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And from the discourse trademark I've seen online, I'm sure people have been reporting it.

173
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:31,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the company, I guess, could lie, but that's an awfully big bet for them to take, is that they're not going to get caught.

174
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:38,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the evidence saying that this game is using AI, not good enough for me.

175
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:45,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's being used as evidence right now, then why aren't we all canceling our Final Fantasy Rebirth pre-orders?

176
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:49,812
[SPEAKER_06]: because Square Enix is going the same way.

177
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:56,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope nobody bought that Prince of Persia game from Ubisoft because Ubisoft CEO CEOs tend to be tone deaf.

178
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:59,522
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, it's going to be the sales that drive those games.

179
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,364
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I want to talk about the second issue.

180
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second issue is

181
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:04,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Plagiarism

182
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:32,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if I'm at Nintendo or I'm at the Pokemon Company, I've probably got the legal team drafting up a cease and desist that's going to hit on Monday or Tuesday.

183
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:44,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is going to be very fascinating, because I think we're on a direct collision course for some type of, you know, Street Fighter versus Fighters history type of thing going on here with this, which is a very classic

184
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom Lost Digimon Storylines

185
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:23,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and what's interesting too, is that there's also this whole thing with the rockstar suing remedy games because the logo is, and it's like, they don't look anything alike, but some companies are much more litigious and in protecting their IP than others.

186
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:36,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the other thing with Pokemon specifically is that I'm pretty sure most of the major Pokemon, maybe not all 1000, but I could be wrong, but most of them, especially the ones that they're going to turn into plushies and toys, they get trademarked.

187
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:57,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the thing that's going to be a little unique about this is that if they can prove in court that these are Pokemon assets that were lifted and pallet changed or like swiped around, you know, these types of things, that's going to be very interesting because I think they've got something with their assets that not all game companies have.

188
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the trademarks for this other stuff.

189
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:09,583
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also, um, I believe there's the 50% change rule to where something becomes free use or fair use.

190
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:17,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing, though, about the 50% rule, that rule might just be here in the U.S., but it might not apply in Japan because, you know, trade and coverage laws are different there.

191
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:22,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they're still selling the game in the U.S., so it still has to be.

192
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

193
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:23,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

194
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:24,148
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

195
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:24,968
[SPEAKER_05]: You got that one.

196
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I am looking at chat as well.

197
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I just want to point out Mike def says I do think that pal world is going to be the flavor of the month game.

198
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:36,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody the concurrent player base is going to drop really hard come in February.

199
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:41,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually I actually kind of agree because here's here's something very important to keep in mind.

200
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:43,038
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Pokemon fans out there.

201
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:44,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I made the mistake.

202
00:17:44,719 --> 00:18:06,873
[SPEAKER_06]: of going in and looking at the discourse trademark on this last night because I find this whole thing actually super fascinating because at the end of the day, usually when you have games that are that hard cloned, and I want to point out, you've got elements of arc in here, you've got like the font is like straight out of Breath of the Wild and a lot of like the art direction when it comes to the structures and the way the world is built is very Breath of the Wild inspired.

203
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,335
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got obviously the Pokemon element so forth.

204
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:10,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It's borrowing heavily

205
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:38,808
[SPEAKER_06]: for many games out there and usually games that are clones like that they fucking suck like we just we go oh it's a mobile knockoff game garbage throw it in the bin right the neat interesting thing about this game that's I think put is like the sum of all the parts is actually kind of not bad especially considering the game is still early access that's that's the wild thing about this game the wild thing about this is that it has no right

206
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:46,873
[SPEAKER_06]: to be as smooth as it is when you consider what all may or may not be going into it.

207
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,735
[SPEAKER_06]: But I agree that with the thing that's a flash in the pan game.

208
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:50,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to tell you why.

209
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:55,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Pokemon fans are getting their feathers extremely ruffled at this game.

210
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a again, there is no, there's no turn-based combat in the game, the core feature of Pokemon.

211
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:07,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this will be a flash in a pan game per se.

212
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,026
[SPEAKER_05]: If it does, it's going to be around for a little while longer because from people I've seen playing this game,

213
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:26,152
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of- not the majority, but a lot of people playing POW World just to spite Pokemon and Game Freak because these are fans of Pokemon who are tired of Game Freak's actions when it comes to the games and so on.

214
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:36,242
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just doing it out of pure spite, which if you ask me is why there were so many concurrent players on their servers to do this, okay?

215
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:46,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, you can't ignore that there is at least 3 million people out there that are saying loud and clear, Nintendo needs to step it up when it comes to tech.

216
00:19:46,227 --> 00:20:04,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it like the fact that, you know, Pokemon in 4k, even though I don't think that's what this game is at all, the fact that that is the perception out there in gaming culture that has absolutely led to why all of these people are suddenly downloading this game and the success and all that and that, oh, it's online multiplayer, it's smooth, it looks really good and all this stuff.

217
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:04,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

218
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:05,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Now,

219
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be also fair to the Pokemon Company.

220
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:17,446
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I know Gen 9 gets a lot of crap, but I still believe in my heart of hearts that that game was set up a little bit because I believe they optimized it for a Switch system that never came out.

221
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I will take that to my grave.

222
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:28,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I firmly believe that OLED Switch that we got was supposed to be something much different, and because of the pandemic, they scaled it way back, and the Pokemon games technically suffered for it.

223
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with the next switch now.

224
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:36,599
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the other thing.

225
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't think Pokemon or whatever has anything to worry about, because here's the thing.

226
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:47,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon's got a lot of soul and a lot of charm because they have the voice acted, you know, Pokemon that make the cute.

227
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:48,747
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the anime.

228
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,007
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the plushies.

229
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:50,628
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the world.

230
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:53,069
[SPEAKER_06]: They got that whole they've got the trainer.

231
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be the very best.

232
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go get them all.

233
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And people, you know, and here's the thing, like I'm going to be honest.

234
00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:04,724
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't completely a dig on PAL world because again, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.

235
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:08,711
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, I found, I find PAL world to be very soulless.

236
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:11,054
[SPEAKER_06]: In Contrast

237
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,288
[SPEAKER_06]: at the end of the day.

238
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something very important to Pokemon that PowerWorld is not bringing to the table.

239
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Now PowerWorld may be successful for other reasons.

240
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,631
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I don't think Pokemon fans have a goddamn thing to worry about.

241
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:56,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Now as far as Nintendo and that that whole mess, I do feel the game that I've played this weekend, I will not be playing in its same form in six months.

242
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:57,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just say that.

243
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:01,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of hoping for that.

244
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:05,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I've seen, there are people who have already set up private servers to play together.

245
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:11,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this gets to CND, there's going to be underground power fight clubs going on.

246
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:14,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

247
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, yeah.

248
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the most interesting thing about this game is it's causing us to face all of these issues in the industry, like, head on.

249
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, all at once.

250
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the AI.

251
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:28,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the clone thing.

252
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:29,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean,

253
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:36,304
[SPEAKER_06]: If we want to talk about asset grabs and putting them in a game, I find it very interesting.

254
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:47,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe out of all the short blogs I read last night, I saw one out of many that mentioned vampire survivors.

255
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, why do I bring that game up?

256
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:57,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that game obviously lifted a lot from something else, but because it was so different

257
00:22:58,632 --> 00:22:59,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people didn't notice.

258
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:06,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Or perhaps they were sick and fucking tired of the company that owned those assets, which is certainly possible.

259
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:07,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody really brought that up.

260
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and then of course there isn't the, and I'm going to say that the comments that the CEO made, they're not great.

261
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:16,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to defend them, but I think a lot of CEOs are making ridiculous comments.

262
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:24,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And that whole thing, what I feel like happened is that, okay, they went away from AI and they hired people because they talk about the person that came in to do this.

263
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:24,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

264
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:25,294
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

265
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:34,841
[SPEAKER_06]: But it sounds like to turn around the amount of monsters they were looking for in a short amount of time, allegedly there may have been some shortcuts, not such a good look.

266
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:36,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um,

267
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:38,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be interesting.

268
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:42,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

269
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:45,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream says this doesn't feel cheap or cobbled together.

270
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:54,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like again, for a game that borrows heavily from a lot of influences, it doesn't feel cheap, especially again for a game that's early access.

271
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster says PAL world definitely has a lot of jank right now.

272
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Could mods change that or will the developer actually stick with it?

273
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:02,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

274
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:03,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too early to tell right now.

275
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

276
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:13,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact is, this game ain't going anywhere, unless we see something happen from Nintendo or the Pokemon company and their legal team.

277
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:14,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And even then, that doesn't mean the game goes away right away.

278
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's I think there's about to be a very interesting legal discussion happening here.

279
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:29,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is going to be something that really guides our 2024 in gaming because something else to consider.

280
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:36,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, everybody else is going to be looking at the runaway success of POW World.

281
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:40,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And now there's going to be clones of the clone.

282
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:43,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Send in the clones!

283
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:44,689
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's about to happen.

284
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, Sony did that a long time ago.

285
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,224
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation All-Stars.

286
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a really great idea.

287
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:59,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, clones of games have always been a thing in this industry.

288
00:24:59,273 --> 00:24:59,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.

289
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Minecraft.

290
00:25:01,294 --> 00:25:01,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

291
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:02,574
[SPEAKER_06]: How many Minecraft?

292
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:07,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, essentially, it's kind of, if you think about where this is, it's kind of a Minecraft clone.

293
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:10,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom, when that came out, then first person shooters were all the rage.

294
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:15,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter 2, probably the most cloned game of all time.

295
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:17,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Or fucking Flappy Bird.

296
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:22,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that gets traction usually ends up getting cloned in one way or another.

297
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:22,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's,

298
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:26,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon is known to and there's other Pokemon clone games out there.

299
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:34,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just this one has now gotten the AI label on it, which is, let's be real, it's the 2024 NFT sticker is now on this game.

300
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:44,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's got a lot of people, you know, but again, I, you know, for power worlds credit, I'm not convinced on the AI front, you feeling like it has AI isn't enough.

301
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:53,035
[SPEAKER_06]: because every CEO is talking about AI and some of them, like I pointed out with Square Enix, some more than others.

302
00:25:53,035 --> 00:26:01,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, again, if they're lying about AI to Steam, that is going to be very, that's a very risky business decision.

303
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:01,819
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

304
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:03,338
[SPEAKER_05]: a great

305
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a step back from this.

306
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:29,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I have about 200 other video games that need some love and attention.

307
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:33,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go show them some love till Verdi comes back on that.

308
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,468
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be an interesting 2024.

309
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:41,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a very interesting way to start it off.

310
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:44,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody could have predicted this seven days ago.

311
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:47,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like all of this came out of nowhere.

312
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:51,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it's gonna be very interesting.

313
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:51,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

314
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw says 2024 is the year that AI be the talk of the town, good or bad.

315
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:59,264
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what's interesting is I was having a chat with a friend on this.

316
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, this is true.

317
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:03,825
[SPEAKER_06]: AI is not leaving, period.

318
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:06,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to figure this out.

319
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:17,813
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of need, what we need to happen is we need our government to regulate the use of AI art and who ultimately owns AI art and most importantly, how AI art can be trained.

320
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:23,197
[SPEAKER_06]: The government needs, they're never going to do a goddamn, our government is incapable of passing a fucking budget.

321
00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:24,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to, they're never going to get to this.

322
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:32,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's going to be the Wild West in some ways or it's it's going to be court cases one one after the other.

323
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream in chat says we also need to differentiate AI art and AI.

324
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:44,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I mean, that's important, too, because AI and game mechanics, you know, AI and game mechanics has been around since the fucking Atari 2600 or even since before that.

325
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:45,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's, you know,

326
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It's AI art.

327
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:49,947
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's the controversial thing.

328
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:53,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's AI art getting trained off of shit that isn't yours.

329
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:57,110
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the very controversial thing out there.

330
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,071
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, that's what this industry has got to figure out.

331
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:11,916
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, when it now, you know, on the other hand, we have Foam Stars, I don't think we have a separate story on that tonight, but we have Foam Stars comes out and says, Oh, yeah, we used mid journey to put AI art as album covers in the game.

332
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:12,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, now,

333
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the stank is on that game.

334
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:20,201
[SPEAKER_06]: The pit the little you remember pig pen from the peanuts.

335
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:30,588
[SPEAKER_06]: That's now what but which is ironic because foam stars game about soap, but but I irony in gaming industry is fucking funny.

336
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:34,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the cloud of stank is on that foam stars game.

337
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are kind of trying to shift the cloud of stank to this game too.

338
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:41,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand it, but it's a different stank for me.

339
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,375
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see.

340
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:49,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, let me tell you, to go back to AI art, let's talk AI voice for a second.

341
00:28:49,018 --> 00:29:01,484
[SPEAKER_05]: A friend of mine, well-known voice actress, found out that somebody ripped her voice from a couple of video games for this person's podcast.

342
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:08,047
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a Pokemon-themed podcast where he ripped voices and had them do scripts and so forth.

343
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:24,246
[SPEAKER_05]: She and a couple other voice actors and actresses actually had to, they found him, sent emails, fans went after this person for ripping the voices, and he eventually apologized and took them all down.

344
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is,

345
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:27,678
[SPEAKER_05]: shouldn't have done it in the first place.

346
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:28,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

347
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:28,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

348
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,660
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, I'll stick with that impersonations.

349
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

350
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:45,291
[SPEAKER_05]: She contacted a friend of mine who works for Pokemon, but because of the laws of it wasn't too much they could really do short of like maybe copyright or trademark.

351
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,653
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now there is no copyright or trademark on voices.

352
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what, I would still loop voice acting in with art.

353
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Voice acting is art.

354
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:55,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's performance art.

355
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I still kind of loop it in that same category that that's, that's the shit we really need to figure out.

356
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:04,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the stuff that needs to be regulated, how we use it in games.

357
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:11,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And to Steam's credit, they're telling companies they need to disclose in their releases, how they're gonna, how they're going to prove it.

358
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:17,157
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's to be seen because you know what, it might come out that yeah, this game fucking lied to Steam about AI.

359
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:18,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be a whole

360
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:33,921
[SPEAKER_06]: other interesting fucking episode when that goes down let me tell you it's it's going to be an interesting year and I yeah it's going to be a very interesting year this game is is kicking us off that's for sure so um

361
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:36,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

362
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:39,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, but yeah, the voice acting not cool.

363
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:40,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that to voice actors.

364
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:43,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if you must stick with bad impersonations.

365
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:52,236
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you have the voice actors permission, such as James Earl Jones gave permission to Disney to continue.

366
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:53,596
[SPEAKER_06]: That's permission.

367
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:56,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's different.

368
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,377
[SPEAKER_06]: But stop doing this without permission.

369
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:00,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would never do that shit on this podcast.

370
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:01,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think

371
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it was one of those things where they meant well, but boy, that was a mistake.

372
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And they learned a real tough lesson on that.

373
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:10,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, yep.

374
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:11,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

375
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,167
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

376
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on on something a little more lighthearted.

377
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:18,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk about this because Rama, you went on a really big trip recently.

378
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:21,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you were really excited about this.

379
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:25,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell me a little bit about where you went and what you did.

380
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:35,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for those of you who didn't know, I spent two weeks in Japan and I had an amazing time.

381
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:46,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I went because I had the opportunity and also the fact that my job is closed for the last two weeks of the year, so I'm like, wait, you mean to tell me we're closed for the last weeks of the year and it's two weeks vacation?

382
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:49,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go to Japan, and I made it work.

383
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:59,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to summarize, I was in Akihabara, I went to Hakone, Takayama, Osaka, Kyoto, Minato, I had a great time.

384
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I was deep into anime, I checked out some video games, I hit some of the arcades, and I just had a really good time.

385
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:16,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I sent you the link through Discord if you wanna show off some of the photos I took, and it's kinda fun.

386
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:22,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I will, but just remember for the podcast feed, we want to make sure we are describing a lot more here.

387
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go through everything, but I noticed you have some trips to the Nintendo stores, so we'll start there.

388
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to pull those up here.

389
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:39,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, tell us a little bit about like, you know, you mentioned like kind of like how you saw gaming culture was maybe a little different there in Japan.

390
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to me a little more about that.

391
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:45,796
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a better preservation of products and devices.

392
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:48,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a more of a love for it.

393
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Like let's talk modern, like the Nintendo store.

394
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,003
[SPEAKER_05]: This is photos from Nintendo store.

395
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:57,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Kyoto.

396
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:57,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

397
00:32:57,604 --> 00:32:58,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was there.

398
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:10,189
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up on the sixth floor in a shopping mall, and I saw... There are products there that I saw that you cannot get at Nintendo Store New York.

399
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:23,273
[SPEAKER_05]: The size of the store is basically twice the size of... Like, 1.5 the size of the entire store itself, but no Pokemon, so that's in a separate section.

400
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was walking around, you could see all of the consoles, you could see all of the merch.

401
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:33,929
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bigger display of the items.

402
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just... It's just amazing.

403
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:46,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in pure awe of what I saw, because I'm like, I've never seen anything like this before.

404
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:49,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, why don't we not have any of this stuff here, you know?

405
00:33:51,716 --> 00:34:02,526
[SPEAKER_05]: My partner is big into Splatoon, and I'm seeing all the Splatoon jackets, lifesavers, you... We're looking at a picture now with a ton of plushies.

406
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:05,749
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, like, travel bags.

407
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:11,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, this... If we had some of this stuff, it would sell like hotcakes.

408
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:11,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

409
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:12,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I

410
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:42,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me a little bit about you took a adventure as like one of your side trips, you went to the Square Enix cafe.

411
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:43,684
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, I find this very interesting.

412
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:44,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to me a little bit about that.

413
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so check this out.

414
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:50,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I stayed at a hotel called REM Akihabara.

415
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:55,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally right there in the heart of Akihabara.

416
00:34:55,115 --> 00:35:00,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I walk down the street and I look to my left and I'm just like, wait, what is this?

417
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:02,798
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Square Enix Cafe.

418
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:11,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and a friend, we went inside and I was just like, this is amazing.

419
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:14,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have that many photos of the inside of the cafe because

420
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:21,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to be that tourist stopping every five feet taking pictures of almost every little thing.

421
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:33,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But inside the cafe itself, there's like little sections devoted to different Final Fantasy games, Kingdom Hearts, and Dragon Quest, and it's just cool merch that you can pick up.

422
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:40,955
[SPEAKER_05]: For a friend of mine, thankfully she's not listening, I picked up two Final Fantasy VII acrylic stands.

423
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:50,942
[SPEAKER_05]: One is Tifa and one is Aerith, and no, she is not holding the, um, the chair.

424
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, did you travel out to like any arcades and what was kind of like the arcade culture like?

425
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcade culture was fun.

426
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:02,389
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was in Kyoto, I went to round one.

427
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:28,386
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was just kind of at first I kind of felt kind of nervous a little intimidated walking in trying to see what was going on so I walked around and I explored and the first thing I saw was a poppin music machine and I was like okay I'm going to play this and I'm just like wait what if my round one card doesn't work here and I look

428
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:31,189
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes 100 yen coins.

429
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, I have a pocket full of coins.

430
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:39,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sitting there shucking coins in and just playing a few rounds of poppin' music.

431
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, by even 10 feet away.

432
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:48,997
[SPEAKER_06]: For those watching live, and I just, I really apologize to the podcast listeners, but I have up on the screen right now, it looks like Ranma was playing Mario Kart at round one.

433
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:49,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

434
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:52,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And check out the Daisy makeover here in the corner.

435
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want everybody to peep that.

436
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,661
[SPEAKER_06]: There's our very own Ranma.

437
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the 20th anniversary DDR machine or 25th one.

438
00:36:58,842 --> 00:36:59,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gold machine.

439
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:02,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played a round of that and I had fun on that machine.

440
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:30,720
[SPEAKER_05]: And I walked around, and I saw the Mario Kart, and I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna get into some Mario Kart.

441
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And I noticed something.

442
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:38,283
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mario Kart machines there take these special, uh, Amy cards.

443
00:37:38,283 --> 00:37:43,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went out and bought one of those for like 300 yen, which is like 2 bucks.

444
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:47,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So that- so I could keep track of- of- of my- of- of my gameplay.

445
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:48,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went through...

446
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:51,809
[SPEAKER_05]: the 50cc course, which was fun.

447
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I jumped to the 100cc course where you actually have to drift in order to stay in first.

448
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, it's like that now?

449
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's play.

450
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, in your photo gallery, I've made my way to this like Dragon Quest store.

451
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:12,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It's looks like a, isn't Lawson like a 7-Eleven type of thing in Japan?

452
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:12,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong.

453
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

454
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:13,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

455
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

456
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:15,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are correct.

457
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:15,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

458
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:16,494
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this all about?

459
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a Dragon Quest themed 7-Eleven?

460
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:20,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes it is.

461
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:26,294
[SPEAKER_05]: In Osaka, there is a Lost Sins family mart that's Dragon Quest themed.

462
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:32,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you walk in, you hear the same sound effect as you walk into a town in a Dragon Quest video game.

463
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:33,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's funny.

464
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:36,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to take pictures of all the cool stuff there.

465
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, this is way too awesome.

466
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:42,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of going into particular gas stations.

467
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:50,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is around the country, but I know in here, like certain Chevrons, you go into the minimart and the sound of the cash register is the fucking sonic ring sound.

468
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:57,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if those are like licensed in the same library or something, but it always throws me like I walk in and hear the sonic ring sounds at certain minimarts.

469
00:38:59,093 --> 00:38:59,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild Wild

470
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that looks like a lot of fun.

471
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:29,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it definitely seems like you've got an increased amount of like presence for, you know, video game embedded in the culture.

472
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:34,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of us probably are aware that like, obviously, Japan kind of appreciates video games, their cultures.

473
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: a little more than we historically have.

474
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:39,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I would argue it's growing here.

475
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still not at that level.

476
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:49,437
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I don't think video games are really looked down on because most the adults, the people that are the adults now us, we grew up with video games.

477
00:39:49,437 --> 00:39:51,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not as like fringe as it used to be.

478
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you don't see like a Dragon Quest themed 7-Eleven here.

479
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:59,504
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember them theming some of them for the Simpsons when the Simpsons movie came out.

480
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:04,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've seen him do it for other things in pop culture, but never just never that.

481
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:16,616
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Rob, one thing I did notice while I was in Japan, like, I saw, like, collaborations and advertisers for the latest Spy Family movie, Spy Family Code White.

482
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:27,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And it reminds me of something where, in Japan, anime is treated like no different from a live primetime television series.

483
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:34,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, all the love that Survivor gets here in the U.S., with popularity and so forth,

484
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:38,067
[SPEAKER_05]: In Japan it could be Pokemon.

485
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:38,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Simple as that.

486
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, okay.

487
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:04,423
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some cute little ads in this gallery we're looking at now on the... Oh, a Sailor Moon store.

488
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:05,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Get out and don't tell my husband.

489
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I, well, don't tell him I dropped almost $200 in the Sailor Moon store.

490
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:13,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't blame you, to be honest.

491
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:15,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a giant ad for Pikmin 4.

492
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:19,580
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an ad on, well, I was on the subway system.

493
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,241
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

494
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:22,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's again, it's one of those things where, yeah.

495
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:23,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, okay.

496
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:24,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about this real quick.

497
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:25,483
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little bit different than video games.

498
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, KFC.

499
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:29,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that, it was that time of year to have your KFC for Christmas.

500
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:31,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say you were there on Christmas day, right?

501
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:32,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a Kentucky Fried Christmas?

502
00:41:33,854 --> 00:41:40,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, let me tell you, I was in Osaka, and I found the KFC, and I go over to get on the line.

503
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: The associate is telling me I gotta go over to the other side.

504
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I walk to the other side, and I see these stairs.

505
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:47,824
[SPEAKER_05]: People are lined up.

506
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:50,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, wait.

507
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:51,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I get on the line.

508
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:58,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I waited about 20 to 25 minutes, got my order, went back to my hotel, sat down, and ate it.

509
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:04,387
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother in Christ, I have never had KFC so delicious in my entire life.

510
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:08,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have, but it's been like years.

511
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:16,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think when I was a kid, that was the last time I had KFC that delicious, that tasty.

512
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:17,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just like, wow.

513
00:42:17,677 --> 00:42:19,338
[SPEAKER_06]: The chicken tastes better on holidays.

514
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:19,919
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just fact.

515
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:27,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I had McDonald's when I was out there and it tasted a lot better than the McDonald's I've had here.

516
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:32,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the whole fact that there's more care put into the work one presents.

517
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,280
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much a cultural thing.

518
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And the quality of the meat is a lot higher than it is here.

519
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, now I'm looking at your photo gallery, and it looks like you went by this store.

520
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:52,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And what caught me interesting about this store, you're at this store called Game Station, it looks like, but they've actually got a Fallout 76 ad in the window.

521
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That is interesting to me, because of course, that is not a game developed in Japan.

522
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:56,643
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something over here.

523
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm was, was this like a

524
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:11,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was like a secondhand type store where they get all types of stuff in there.

525
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:16,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's why I went to Nakano Broadway which is like four floors of

526
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:19,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd stuff.

527
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:19,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

528
00:43:19,706 --> 00:43:20,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this in the store.

529
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:24,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Five Nights at Freddy's, Minecraft, Nuka Cola.

530
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:26,010
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Skyrim shirt.

531
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So this really is like shit big in America.

532
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:30,173
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not big in Japan.

533
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:31,394
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

534
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:34,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go to like a book off or a game off or?

535
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:37,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I went to a book off and.

536
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:40,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Amy, I made out like a bandit.

537
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there we go.

538
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

539
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:44,682
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had known that you were going somewhere that had Transformers.

540
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:52,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have sent you over more than just for my cup.

541
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:55,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's been really big back into collecting Otus Transformers.

542
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:06,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, let me tell you, when I was in Japan, I get an email from Amazon about my Sailor Venus cuposkets.

543
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:09,351
[SPEAKER_05]: They've changed the street date to unknown.

544
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:10,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, you know what?

545
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to find it when I was there.

546
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:14,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I found both of the figures that I wanted.

547
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:20,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid a total of 4,000 yen after tax, which is at the time a little bit over $25.

548
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:24,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a lot cheaper than...

549
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,163
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can't, I canceled my pre-orders.

550
00:44:28,163 --> 00:44:34,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And the best part is it says on the packages, unopened, but I bought a lot of secondhand stuff.

551
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:41,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And from looking at it, you can't tell it's secondhand because of the care that people put into it.

552
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:53,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now I'm- Oh no, you can go like designer bag shopping in like say Ginza or Bropungi.

553
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:55,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I'm talking like Chanel.

554
00:44:57,843 --> 00:44:59,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Dior, you name it.

555
00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:07,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's like the only tiniest little defect, it's enough to mark something down to almost 25% of what it originally cost.

556
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:10,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is 100% correct.

557
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:17,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some, like I said, some of the stuff I saw, like I saw somebody sell something, it was brand new.

558
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:20,366
[SPEAKER_05]: All he did was open the box and look at it and put it right back in the box.

559
00:45:21,058 --> 00:45:22,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Massive markdown!

560
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:29,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, right now I'm holding one of the Ranma 1.5 games for Duo CD.

561
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid... PC Engine Duo?

562
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:33,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

563
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:34,008
[SPEAKER_05]: PC Engine Duo.

564
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:34,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

565
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid a little bit over 2,000 yen after tax.

566
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:44,135
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were to take, like, the paid stickers off and look at it, I swear, this looks like it's brand new.

567
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much care and love.

568
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,219
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need is a duo, right?

569
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:49,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

570
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:51,160
[SPEAKER_01]: VOG Network, DJ Ranma S

571
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:11,013
[SPEAKER_01]: then people are definitely charging up for them, like 300 bucks for the system.

572
00:46:11,013 --> 00:46:21,995
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you can just get, like, the Core Graphics unit, which is just like the TurboGrafx, like the plain base TurboGrafx.

573
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:27,136
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the Core Graphics that uses Japanese HuCards pretty inexpensively.

574
00:46:27,136 --> 00:46:32,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can sometimes find the Duo add-on a little bit less expensively.

575
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:39,443
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to get you is, depending on what kind of card that they take, like if it's an arcade card, those are going to be pretty pricey.

576
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:52,715
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was saying you'll want a Japanese core graphics, because the converters for the HuCards, they don't always work, and they're sometimes more expensive than the systems.

577
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys are talking about games.

578
00:47:14,571 --> 00:47:17,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh sorry, which is important in what this show is about.

579
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:19,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Jamie.

580
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:21,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one last little thing.

581
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,855
[SPEAKER_01]: This will help people who decide to import games.

582
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:31,438
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use an American Turbo Duo and it will play most of those games because it has it built in, but you'll need to actually have a full Turbo Duo.

583
00:47:33,342 --> 00:47:37,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so obviously, I'm trying to interject because sorry, no, you're fine.

584
00:47:37,244 --> 00:47:40,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you all are talking about games is what this show is really about.

585
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:43,387
[SPEAKER_06]: But you all know that there is a secret second topic on this show.

586
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is food.

587
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:57,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So Rama, I have to ask you this, because I'm looking at this fucking divine looking bakery, like I see all of these donuts, like I'm crying in diabetes right now, but I would I would have just a bite or five.

588
00:47:58,055 --> 00:47:59,856
[SPEAKER_06]: of many of these divine samplings in here.

589
00:47:59,856 --> 00:48:02,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And we even have like video game themed things here.

590
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:08,923
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got like little Pikachu and Snorlax themed, you know, like donuts there and all of this stuff.

591
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:11,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed you got all these pictures of the cases.

592
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:14,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, now I got to read a bitch for a minute here.

593
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:17,468
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got all of these divine donut offerings.

594
00:48:17,468 --> 00:48:22,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I see in the next picture, you bought the plainest fucking donut on the rack.

595
00:48:22,352 --> 00:48:23,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Explain yourself.

596
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:28,617
[SPEAKER_06]: You ate the plainest fucking donut you could in Japan.

597
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:31,420
[SPEAKER_06]: What is wrong with you?

598
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,422
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to blame the medication that I am on.

599
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:35,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

600
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:36,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine, fine.

601
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:37,505
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

602
00:48:37,505 --> 00:48:39,447
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

603
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:43,310
[SPEAKER_06]: As a diabetic, I shouldn't be bitching, but I could.

604
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:44,151
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me laugh.

605
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:47,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, like anything in that case he could have ordered.

606
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:50,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, let me tell you something.

607
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:58,960
[SPEAKER_05]: If you saw the pictures of the food that I ate there, oh, you'd be one angry bitch, okay?

608
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,500
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I would.

609
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you tasted some of the food that I had, you'd swear you have died and gone to heaven.

610
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:13,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've had real sushi and sashimi, and I was just like, oh my God, this is delicious.

611
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:17,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I had beef sushi, and I was just like, this is a thing?

612
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:17,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

613
00:49:18,144 --> 00:49:22,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Rama goes to Japan and just the most divine baked goods you've ever seen here.

614
00:49:44,006 --> 00:49:48,467
[SPEAKER_06]: orders a fucking plain donut.

615
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:49,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

616
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:49,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

617
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:49,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

618
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:50,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

619
00:49:50,328 --> 00:49:51,068
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

620
00:49:51,068 --> 00:49:54,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me explain that again.

621
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on medication for weight loss.

622
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,330
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to justify it.

623
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny more than anything.

624
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:02,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

625
00:50:02,071 --> 00:50:11,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying, as I'm walking around building up my hunger, I'm just like, I just wanted to get something, you know, to try.

626
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:11,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

627
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,492
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know Dunkin Donuts, right?

628
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:15,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, of course.

629
00:50:15,814 --> 00:50:21,839
[SPEAKER_05]: To summarize, they had a chain in Japan, sold it off, and it became Mr. Donut.

630
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically where I went.

631
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:27,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was way better than any Dunkin Donuts I've ever seen.

632
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:31,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a plain honey dip donut from Mr. Donut.

633
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:35,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Japanese coffee, which is absolutely delicious.

634
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:38,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I came back with four bags of it, okay?

635
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:41,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to try the Mr. Donut.

636
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:47,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be going back to Japan soon, and I promise you I will try the different Pokemon.

637
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,193
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I love that.

638
00:50:50,193 --> 00:50:58,120
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I'm looking at some of the other pictures you got, you got some, but then wait, not only do you have this yummy, you know, dish here and then this is a very pretty, I love this.

639
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And then why did you take a picture of Shake Shack?

640
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:09,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I had to, I got, I got off the subway and I turned and I just go, Oh my God, it's a Shake Shack.

641
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:13,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same fucking thing you can see in any town.

642
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:14,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Shake Shack, Ranma.

643
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:22,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I saw a Shen Yun advertisement when I was on the train.

644
00:51:22,243 --> 00:51:29,250
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was going to Ikebukuro, I saw an advertisement for Shen Yun and I'm just like, are you serious right now?

645
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly nature is back.

646
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:33,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you could take a picture of this.

647
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:36,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, nobody's going to believe me.

648
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, all right.

649
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I know we want to get into some other stuff.

650
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:49,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to, you know, but I'm sure you and I'm sure you'll talk about this a lot more on Anime Jam session as well.

651
00:51:49,013 --> 00:52:01,077
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, just kind of any other takeaways, especially remembering like, you know, this is gaming and gaming culture show just kind of like any other like takeaways about, like how it was different in Japan to you than what you're used to seeing here.

652
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:07,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget the proper term for it, but it's called the Spirit of Hospitality.

653
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:26,265
[SPEAKER_05]: That is basically what I saw when I went into Animate, or BookOff, or Surugaya, or Super Potato, seeing all these second-hand video games and arcade anime swag and so forth, looking to see the care and maticulation of it.

654
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:31,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you'd swear it's something brand new that someone just bought, and they're just putting it out on display.

655
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:38,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the love and care that I saw that made me feel like, you know what?

656
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:39,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this.

657
00:52:39,419 --> 00:52:41,440
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not hard.

658
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:56,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, when I was at Super Potato, I saw a bunch of video games that didn't have boxes or manuals, but the way the carts were laid there and pristine wrapped, and it's like... You can tell there's love behind all of this.

659
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:59,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, are you- There's pride in your work.

660
00:52:59,404 --> 00:52:59,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yup.

661
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:05,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Surely you're thinking about already going back.

662
00:53:05,074 --> 00:53:06,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

663
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And taking me with you.

664
00:53:07,877 --> 00:53:08,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And me.

665
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:09,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

666
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:11,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you this now.

667
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:24,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The best advice I can say if you're going there as an anime fan or a gaming fan, if you want to buy stuff, make sure that you can take two carry ons and save Akihabara for last.

668
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:50,264
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's where you could be doing the bulk of your shopping even though I was in Bendintown which is better known as Nihonbashi where you saw the gaming photos as in Osaka but there's more over in Akihabara and I say that because there is a Don Quijote right up the street where you could pick up a second bag for 15 bucks to pack your stuff in and go

669
00:53:51,638 --> 00:53:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

670
00:53:52,799 --> 00:54:00,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to close with just a few more of Ranma's photos here because I've got a few more food shots here and we'll kind of wrap this segment with this.

671
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:01,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this.

672
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:03,607
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to like a nice Diwali presentation.

673
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, for me, I'm very happy.

674
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:07,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I see everything's in English as well.

675
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:11,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like I wouldn't be too lost if I went to Japan, but you got some very lovely things there.

676
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:16,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have another, it looks like another picture of the menu here, and then just, you know, some more food.

677
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:18,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we just end it with beer 30.

678
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that is an actual restaurant that I walked by, you know.

679
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:28,461
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a fast food, it was a regular sit-down restaurant with different types of beers on tap.

680
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:30,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what time it is.

681
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:35,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will tell you this, I went to this place called, I think it's called Meat and Beer.

682
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:36,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a picture of it.

683
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:39,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I sat down, had a beef bowl and a beer.

684
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:46,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid 1,200 yen for it, under-converted, that's about $8 for a full meal.

685
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,367
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't beat that.

686
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:58,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot cheaper to eat out in Japan than it is to just go grocery shopping.

687
00:54:58,572 --> 00:55:07,216
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends just checked up at an Airbnb in Kyoto and lived there for like four months.

688
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:12,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, it was inexpensive and everything was accessible and yeah.

689
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you're in Tokyo, traveling throughout the trains is just simply amazing, and it's so easy.

690
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't use your cell phone.

691
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,041
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an iPhone, you're good.

692
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:31,844
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're Andrew, like me, you're going to need an IC card.

693
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:36,510
[SPEAKER_05]: which I have one right here.

694
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:40,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I just understood it was discouraged to be on your phone on the train.

695
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:43,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, not anymore.

696
00:55:43,596 --> 00:55:46,138
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people who are using their phones as per normal.

697
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:49,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I have seen people eating and drinking on the platforms.

698
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:55,726
[SPEAKER_05]: From what Evan has told me, as long as you're not publicly intoxicated, it's kind of sort of fair game.

699
00:55:55,726 --> 00:55:56,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.

700
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:57,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

701
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:07,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, you got to meet up with Evan from well, he was affiliated with Electric Sisterhood some time ago and wrote for their website and all that stuff when they were still around.

702
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So and he's out there doing like teaching now, right?

703
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,271
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

704
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can.

705
00:56:38,191 --> 00:56:40,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I really didn't play a whole lot.

706
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:48,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I felt fine a week until I had my COVID shot, and I'm already starting to feel a little bit better, just, you know, I'm drifting off.

707
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:49,125
[SPEAKER_01]: But I...

708
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:56,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my first sponsored stream for Genshin Impact, and you want to know what's sad?

709
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:58,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Game's fucking fun.

710
00:56:58,675 --> 00:56:59,476
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.

711
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:01,999
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people super into it.

712
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:05,682
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still want to boot Paimon off a cliff.

713
00:57:05,682 --> 00:57:08,505
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason why they call it Weeb Breath of the Wild.

714
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:08,865
[SPEAKER_05]: But like,

715
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:26,469
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a thing for my sponsorship that if I play with somebody for like 30 minutes on a stream, like a co-op or something, that they'll do something, I don't know.

716
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:39,962
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, you know, I went into it with no expectations and left very, very pleased with it, although I really wish I could change the language so that I don't have to hear Paimon's voice.

717
00:57:43,745 --> 00:57:51,493
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool, definitely a little bit simplistic and the location system in the game definitely gives you some work.

718
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:53,815
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was pleased with it.

719
00:57:53,815 --> 00:58:01,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did some of the new DLC for Cult of the Lamb, The Sins of the Flesh.

720
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:02,884
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go around doing naked dances.

721
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:10,714
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a rhythm game section in there, which is really hard to do on the controller.

722
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:19,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm even thinking about just doing that part on the keyboard, but you play drums and it's very simple poppin' music with three buttons.

723
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:23,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can get people drunk.

724
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:27,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, I made very sure to make a special drink just for you in my village.

725
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:28,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

726
00:58:28,476 --> 00:58:31,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Or my my compound, I should say.

727
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were very, very drunk.

728
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:37,465
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably opened a wine cooler and I passed out.

729
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:40,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was a very beautiful, fruity drink.

730
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,050
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, well, that's how I like it.

731
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I give everyone else beer.

732
00:58:44,694 --> 00:59:01,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, um, you know, going back through and doing, like, if you have, if you elected to have the one who waits, um, be one of your minions, then they keep giving you quest lines to go and retrieve certain things from the other areas.

733
00:59:01,546 --> 00:59:07,591
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remembered reading in the, the information for the pack that there was supposed to be another area open up.

734
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:25,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know, but you can still also get, you know, I've already gotten all of the, like, the special buildings, so I did the, uh, what is it that they call it, when you get enough, uh, soul energy, you can upgrade things in your town or get new items.

735
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:30,551
[SPEAKER_01]: They've addressed some of people's complaints.

736
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:36,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have extra storage for grains that the little grain silos can be filled out of.

737
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:42,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have the thing that holds like 1,200 pieces of poop.

738
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have magic poop.

739
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can get a golden poop.

740
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:48,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what it is.

741
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:50,064
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pick it up, it gives you money.

742
00:59:51,104 --> 01:00:00,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like, I don't know what like all the poops do, but there's a rainbow poop, and it makes whatever you put it on grow like immediately.

743
01:00:00,836 --> 01:00:02,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um...

744
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:23,159
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just, there's just neat stuff and you can, like, you have this whole Sin currency in the game now, too, where if someone, like, has gone and done some Sin stuff and the Sin starts taking over, you can go absorb them and absorb their Sin and then use it to go shopping.

745
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:28,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if I could just pay Sin to go shopping, then... I wish I could go to Japan and just buy stuff with Sin.

746
01:00:28,922 --> 01:00:29,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be fun.

747
01:00:33,374 --> 01:00:36,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play Dead by Daylight.

748
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:59,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be doing that tonight because I don't have the mental fortitude to play killer tonight and deal with people.

749
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:09,748
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did... People are being stinky because Rank Reset just happened, you know, not long ago.

750
01:01:09,748 --> 01:01:14,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the PTB that happened because we're now getting Alan Wake.

751
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:30,815
[SPEAKER_01]: right i forgot to bring that up but that's uh that's cool it's an interesting cross i like in in his little intro that you know how like for all the other survivors they show them getting mercilessly murdered at the end of their thing or whatever not him

752
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:33,716
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, do you know who I am?

753
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:36,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Alan Wake, motherfucker.

754
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at my flashlight.

755
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,020
[SPEAKER_01]: All of his stuff is flashlight based.

756
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

757
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:44,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably I'm probably going to hate getting his adept.

758
01:01:44,503 --> 01:01:46,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

759
01:01:46,464 --> 01:01:52,368
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was pretty much my my gaming week.

760
01:01:52,368 --> 01:01:58,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And apart from just watching all the fun on AGDQ, that was that was pretty great.

761
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:13,285
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, like I said, normally I would be doing Killer Night tonight on Dead by Daylight, but I think the only thing I'll be killing is my mattress when I pass out on it.

762
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:14,512
[SPEAKER_06]: All good.

763
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:14,852
[SPEAKER_06]: All good.

764
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:16,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We understand you're under the weather.

765
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:17,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hate to make you keep talking.

766
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But before you head out, I know you wanted to touch on the classic game of the week this week.

767
01:02:21,857 --> 01:02:24,259
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna kind of wait for you guys to do your parts.

768
01:02:24,259 --> 01:02:24,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

769
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:25,320
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do class.

770
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're good.

771
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:31,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just I'll just sit here in and listen.

772
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:35,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but like, I've literally been nodding off in between stories.

773
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:35,748
[SPEAKER_06]: All good.

774
01:02:35,748 --> 01:02:37,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to take care of the stories you were set to do?

775
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:39,966
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't mind.

776
01:02:39,966 --> 01:02:40,747
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you got it.

777
01:02:40,747 --> 01:02:47,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I can't but you get your you get your your weeks out of the way and I'll do classic game and then I'll just chill here.

778
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:49,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sounds good.

779
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:53,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so let's go to then, Ranma, your your classic game of the week.

780
01:02:54,906 --> 01:02:56,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, my wires are gone.

781
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:58,469
[SPEAKER_06]: See, everything is breaking down tonight.

782
01:02:58,469 --> 01:02:59,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all breaking down.

783
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try, how about your gaming week?

784
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:04,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't intend on getting sick.

785
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is what we call the Curse of the Koi.

786
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:11,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is a complete malfunction, meltdown.

787
01:03:11,919 --> 01:03:13,560
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's happening.

788
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the Curse of the Koi.

789
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:17,944
[SPEAKER_05]: On my show, we have someone named Koi.

790
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:20,366
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, whenever she tries to join the show,

791
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:24,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardware failures, software failures across the board.

792
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't wish that on the show.

793
01:03:26,654 --> 01:03:30,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to the point where when it happens, we just go, damn it, Koi.

794
01:03:30,175 --> 01:03:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she goes, when we tell her, she's like, you're welcome.

795
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:34,557
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

796
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:38,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the spirit, if the spirit of Koi is in this room, knock twice.

797
01:03:38,998 --> 01:03:40,579
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

798
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:44,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Ranma, how was your gaming week?

799
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,221
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty good.

800
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:57,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Mondays when I get home from work, I join my friend Kurohikari-chan, and we jump on Discord and join the Alliance, and we play Phantasy Star Online 2.

801
01:03:57,548 --> 01:04:04,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do that every week for a few hours, and the rest of them are just going at it.

802
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:10,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last time I logged in last week, I've noticed I have logged over 700 hours into the game.

803
01:04:10,158 --> 01:04:11,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, oh wow.

804
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:21,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, my weapons and stuff is not as nice as theirs, but we still do LTQs and all that good stuff, which is kind of fun.

805
01:04:21,878 --> 01:04:35,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, when I'm at work and I have some free time, I see- I find myself playing, like, Monopoly Go, or Angry Birds, Bubble Blast, or that- that- that royal game that- that keeps advertising.

806
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I just downloaded- Oh god, you play that?

807
01:04:38,703 --> 01:04:48,102
[SPEAKER_05]: tired of seeing the advertisements i'm just like you know i'm gonna see what this is all about so all right well it's it's a sit-down game when you're in the other office that's all that is

808
01:04:49,563 --> 01:05:06,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yes, as I've said, I did put some time in on Power World, which is no longer, and I switched, and after my frustration of the game, I switched that off, and I went back to playing Yohane the Parhelion, Sunshine in the Mirror, and that's basically, it's a Metroidvania game.

809
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:13,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Long story short, you have to find the rest of her friends, and you get all these mystic items and so forth, and you just gotta rescue them.

810
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:15,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun.

811
01:05:15,934 --> 01:05:17,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

812
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:17,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

813
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:20,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

814
01:05:20,662 --> 01:05:22,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that's basically it.

815
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:28,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that once I'm done with Yohane the Pahelion, I can actually finish Crisis Core.

816
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:35,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I could try to get more... I could finish Cobra Kai, because less than, like, what, 30-something days?

817
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:44,707
[SPEAKER_05]: FF7 Rebirth drops, so, you know, I gotta get that PS5 and do the Remake Integrate, and then jump right into that, so...

818
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:48,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I need to do a replay on PS5 before that comes out.

819
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:52,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And because I never did the yeah, I never did the Yuffie part.

820
01:05:52,371 --> 01:05:58,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I started it because I remember it was I was at Bobby's house when that first came out with the PSR.

821
01:05:58,135 --> 01:06:01,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not like when it first came out, but like the Dragon Con right around then.

822
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:07,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember playing the beginning of it, but I needed to see kind of the whole thing start to finish, obviously, which I still haven't done.

823
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:08,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

824
01:06:08,884 --> 01:06:09,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

825
01:06:09,524 --> 01:06:10,385
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

826
01:06:11,283 --> 01:06:11,943
[SPEAKER_06]: my gaming week.

827
01:06:11,943 --> 01:06:14,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I did play a little bit of pal world.

828
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:19,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I did anything extremely notable, but just enough to get a sense of what the game was all about.

829
01:06:19,588 --> 01:06:25,431
[SPEAKER_06]: But other stuff I played Diablo three, I was continuing on with the current season that had started.

830
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:29,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got I got two characters to 70 because I started with a necromancer.

831
01:06:29,313 --> 01:06:31,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, I think I want to play Demon Hunter.

832
01:06:31,895 --> 01:06:32,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So I switched to Demon Hunter.

833
01:06:32,936 --> 01:06:34,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was playing a little bit of that.

834
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:37,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll be going back to Diablo four because now see

835
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:38,139
[SPEAKER_06]: and DJ Ranma S

836
01:06:52,952 --> 01:06:57,115
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the wrist pad's not RGB so you don't have to worry about that type of damage.

837
01:07:11,346 --> 01:07:12,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, where was I?

838
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So Diablo 4, Season 3 is starting this week, so I'll be checking that out.

839
01:07:17,169 --> 01:07:28,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Final Fantasy XIV, the 6.55 patch came out that has the story that now really leads us to Dawn Trail, and they were really setting up the story for that.

840
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:34,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was cute, and they brought the first female Hrothgar,

841
01:07:34,537 --> 01:07:34,857
[SPEAKER_06]: FF14 Players

842
01:08:04,797 --> 01:08:11,382
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of my friends that I hang out with in real life really enjoys shooty games like Overwatch.

843
01:08:11,382 --> 01:08:13,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we play Overwatch together.

844
01:08:13,624 --> 01:08:17,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've been, I feel like I'm getting better.

845
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:20,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm getting really good with Life Weaver.

846
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: But my friend says it's just because he's easy.

847
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

848
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:25,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I also feel like I'm really good with Moira.

849
01:08:46,573 --> 01:08:53,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when there's a Sombra that's pissing me off or, you know, somebody that I feel like Moira is kind of like my go-to to be a little bit of a sneaky bitch.

850
01:08:53,736 --> 01:08:59,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know a lot of people roll their eyes when they hear Moira on support, because a lot of Moiras go DPS Moira.

851
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:03,841
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like I throw plenty of heal balls when it's appropriate.

852
01:09:03,841 --> 01:09:05,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't just use DPS balls.

853
01:09:05,401 --> 01:09:06,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So heal, please.

854
01:09:06,682 --> 01:09:07,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

855
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:08,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Heal, please.

856
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:12,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And believe me, that culture is alive and well in Overwatch.

857
01:09:12,004 --> 01:09:14,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody can be full health and it's like, I need healing.

858
01:09:14,705 --> 01:09:15,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I need healing.

859
01:09:15,586 --> 01:09:16,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I need healing.

860
01:09:16,346 --> 01:09:43,745
[SPEAKER_06]: warp prompt oh my god all of it culverts but I just imagine that everybody has the same problem I have where I have chubby fingers and I accidentally hit the key bind all the time for I need healing like as a healer and these people in the game must think I'm a loon because I'm like it's like but my fat keys hit the wrong or my fat fingers hit the wrong keys all the time so what can you do

861
01:09:45,253 --> 01:09:47,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my gaming week.

862
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:48,395
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

863
01:09:48,395 --> 01:09:50,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we're getting into the news now.

864
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:51,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

865
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.

866
01:09:52,497 --> 01:09:54,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we do want to do a classic game.

867
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:55,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's fine.

868
01:09:55,678 --> 01:09:57,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do a classic game.

869
01:09:57,879 --> 01:09:59,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, that's fine.

870
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,721
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get set up to do that.

871
01:10:00,721 --> 01:10:01,721
[SPEAKER_06]: We must roll the bumper.

872
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:06,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a boo-boo with the classic game though, because it was aiming for January 2014.

873
01:10:06,383 --> 01:10:09,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is October 2014.

874
01:10:09,725 --> 01:10:11,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But it counts, because I said so.

875
01:10:12,771 --> 01:10:13,832
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura IGDAF

876
01:10:48,863 --> 01:10:56,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

877
01:10:56,625 --> 01:11:01,487
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

878
01:11:01,487 --> 01:11:02,247
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

879
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:09,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So still, even even if we're talking about a game that's nine and a half years old, this is still pretty.

880
01:11:09,549 --> 01:11:10,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm impressed that this game is that old.

881
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,391
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you pick tonight, DarkSakura?

882
01:11:13,391 --> 01:11:14,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Alien Isolation.

883
01:11:16,326 --> 01:11:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: which I can't play this game because it makes me really motion sick, but I freaking love the game so much and diving into it.

884
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:30,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, the game came out in 2014.

885
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a survival horror game that was developed by Creative Assembly and it was published by Sega.

886
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:41,528
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out on PS3, PS4, for Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

887
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:55,838
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is based off of the Alien series that's 15 years after the original 1979 film where you play Amanda Ripley who is the daughter of Ellen Ripley.

888
01:11:58,086 --> 01:12:05,972
[SPEAKER_01]: She's basically been looking for all these clues about what happened to her mom and trying to find her.

889
01:12:05,972 --> 01:12:17,462
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a lot about her story too, about how Weyland-Yutani tried to pay for all of her education and do all of this, and then she turned her back on them once she was old enough.

890
01:12:19,363 --> 01:12:33,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of her own ingenuity and sometimes, I mean, you can tell she's like really freaked out during the whole thing, but she perseveres despite her fear.

891
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I really like the character.

892
01:12:36,415 --> 01:12:38,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and she's just like a real person.

893
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:40,436
[SPEAKER_01]: She can be a bitch to people.

894
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:43,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, she makes mistakes.

895
01:12:43,396 --> 01:12:45,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how fleshed out she is.

896
01:12:45,437 --> 01:12:57,399
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's cool about this game is that it mimics the aesthetic of the first movie.

897
01:12:57,399 --> 01:13:03,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the second movie was even more in the same lens as the aesthetic, just, you know, a bit more

898
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:10,485
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what would have been a natural progression of aesthetics and design.

899
01:13:10,485 --> 01:13:20,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like, oh, we're going to do Prometheus, where all of our technology looks like it's from bajillion years after the movie we're supposed to be a prequel to.

900
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,073
[SPEAKER_01]: No comment.

901
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:24,635
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is it is a

902
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:36,691
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally intended to be a third-person game, but they used first-person to give it a more intense mood and feel.

903
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:40,292
[SPEAKER_01]: There are DLC packs.

904
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:44,853
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even one that recreates scenes from Aliens.

905
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:52,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I recall, I want to say that they got some of the original actors to reprise their roles.

906
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, no John Hurt.

907
01:13:55,778 --> 01:14:05,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Those scenes were set after his character had explosive front-end diarrhea in the form of an alien.

908
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:23,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have some AI built in that controls the aliens' movements, which is proper use of AI.

909
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:25,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello!

910
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:30,365
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the designs were based around the AI that guides the aliens' movements.

911
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,927
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very sophisticated.

912
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,628
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been many ports of this game.

913
01:14:35,628 --> 01:14:37,629
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be getting into that in a little bit.

914
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:40,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a television adaptation, which

915
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:44,495
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch Link through IGN.

916
01:14:44,495 --> 01:14:47,238
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it is single player.

917
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:51,181
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a massive emphasis on your stealth.

918
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:58,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when that alien comes down, it can hear and smell and...

919
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:03,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, pretty on the ball.

920
01:15:03,054 --> 01:15:12,624
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run and climb ladders, go through vents, crouch behind objects, basically breaking line of sight to do stuff like that.

921
01:15:12,624 --> 01:15:14,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And the alien is not your only enemy.

922
01:15:16,549 --> 01:15:22,117
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hide under tables or go into empty lockers, you know.

923
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:29,448
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the hostiles are the other humans on the Sevastopol station where you arrive.

924
01:15:32,193 --> 01:15:38,079
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these series of androids that are called, um, what were they called?

925
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:38,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Working Joes.

926
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to see if I can find the name in here.

927
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:49,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you, you arrive after they've already had, uh, an alien incident.

928
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:56,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it just reiterates a lot of the themes that go on in some of the alien movies, how humans are stupid.

929
01:15:59,673 --> 01:16:07,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really is a lot of my emotions have overridden logic is what these are.

930
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:13,383
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a game worth going back and playing, or at least watching a good playthrough.

931
01:16:13,383 --> 01:16:23,390
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole thing that brings Amanda there is that a representative of the company, who you find out is an android,

932
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:31,966
[SPEAKER_01]: He arrives and says that they found the Nostromo's flight recorder.

933
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:39,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was found on a salvage ship called the Anesidora and was brought on Sevastopol Station.

934
01:16:39,453 --> 01:16:49,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, with what happened with the Nostromo and the fact that, of course, the company knows what the Nostromo was going out there for, they ended up

935
01:16:50,638 --> 01:16:55,841
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, wanting to take control of that black box, to retrieve it.

936
01:16:55,841 --> 01:17:02,845
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they get onto the colony, of course, it's mayhem, everything is shut down.

937
01:17:05,814 --> 01:17:26,371
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all caused by one of the, by the captain of the Anesidora when it was his wife who, after they went to explore the derelict ship on that planet, you know, the same one from Alien.

938
01:17:29,113 --> 01:17:40,399
[SPEAKER_01]: She basically, they, he insisted she break quarantine, come on the ship, got her to Sevastopol and the chestburster popped out and we know what happened from there.

939
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:58,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, you are fighting the station's AI Apollo, um, who has put in like different measures to try to control what's going on and keep the, the, uh, the being contained, the alien contained.

940
01:18:01,114 --> 01:18:09,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Seegson, which is the company that controls Sevastopol Station, actually sold it to Weyland-Yutani.

941
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:13,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why Apollo is trying to protect the alien.

942
01:18:13,084 --> 01:18:21,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically it's a lot of her trying to go in and survive and find the flight recorder.

943
01:18:22,592 --> 01:18:28,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, try to save as many people as she can.

944
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:33,176
[SPEAKER_01]: But just all kinds of stuff, you know, goes on.

945
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:35,637
[SPEAKER_01]: She does not have a good day of it.

946
01:18:35,637 --> 01:18:40,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, even going through some of the same things that Ripley went through at the end.

947
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:48,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there are many spinoffs from this.

948
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:52,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I read the comics that she was in, it was really good.

949
01:18:52,006 --> 01:18:58,391
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was... Basically, they had...

950
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:07,475
[SPEAKER_01]: conceived the game after finishing Viking Battle for Asgard with Sega.

951
01:19:07,475 --> 01:19:11,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Sega had acquired the license for Aliens games in December 2006.

952
01:19:11,677 --> 01:19:23,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they put the first prototype out there, where basically one person controlled the alien and the other would try to hide from the alien, you know, and Sega was like, we like this.

953
01:19:26,186 --> 01:19:40,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was based of course more off of Alien as opposed to Aliens, but there were a few things that of course were included as nods to stuff that goes on in Aliens.

954
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:51,249
[SPEAKER_01]: They really were trying to maintain that retro-futuristic atmosphere.

955
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:58,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox, the studio, provided them with 3 terabytes of production material.

956
01:19:58,632 --> 01:20:07,175
[SPEAKER_01]: That included costume photography, concept art, set design, behind-the-scenes photos, videos, and the film's original sound effect recording.

957
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:14,304
[SPEAKER_01]: they were able to get things that nobody had seen.

958
01:20:14,304 --> 01:20:20,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you didn't work on the movie, you didn't, you didn't know any of this.

959
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:24,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it shows in the production quality.

960
01:20:24,072 --> 01:20:25,753
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is, you know, amazing.

961
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:35,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have the chunky, you know, phone receivers, monochrome displays, CRT monitors with distortion, and even some with burn-in.

962
01:20:36,481 --> 01:21:05,437
[SPEAKER_01]: You have they recorded the animations these monitors for on the VHS and Betamax recorders and you know, they They really went all out for the effects I mean, I can't say enough good and it also does run on a proprietary engine that was used in Viking Battle for Asgard, but it was tweaked to include the atmospheric and lighting effects and the way that the alien behaves and

963
01:21:06,437 --> 01:21:19,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It also incorporates deferred rendering so that they can put hundreds of dynamic lights in a scene and, you know, have it work properly and not take up too many resources.

964
01:21:19,825 --> 01:21:25,388
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, it's a very, very amazing system that they worked out there.

965
01:21:25,388 --> 01:21:28,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, it would still, you know, go.

966
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had some canceled things that were in there.

967
01:21:31,692 --> 01:21:33,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they,

968
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to have, like, people fashioning weapons, but there was more to the game than just, you know, weapons and shooting.

969
01:21:46,794 --> 01:22:00,597
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to also include the alien's blood as an in-game mechanic, you know, so that, like, you could melt through some things as part of a puzzle, but then they thought, said it would take that into a, quote, weird direction.

970
01:22:03,872 --> 01:22:12,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping, because they said that a lot of it was developed with a third person view and I would love to see if someone's modded that back in.

971
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:18,555
[SPEAKER_01]: But skipping past some of the marketing stuff, there is DLC including Crew Expendable.

972
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:21,859
[SPEAKER_01]: and Last Survivor.

973
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:24,441
[SPEAKER_01]: They were made available when the game came out.

974
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:39,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So Crew Expendable included the Nostromo edition which was the scene from, recreated a scene from Alien and involved the player controlling either Ripley, Dallas, or Parker trying to flush the creature out of the Nostromo's air vents into the airlock.

975
01:22:40,237 --> 01:22:51,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, as I recall, I think was actually more based out of a deleted scene from the original movie that might have been reincorporated into the director's cut.

976
01:22:51,865 --> 01:22:57,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Last Survivor was also made available to players who pre-ordered.

977
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:06,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And you control Ripley as she tries to activate the Nostromo self-destruct sequence and escape.

978
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Jonesy is there.

979
01:23:08,736 --> 01:23:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: We love our Jonesy.

980
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:13,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Good Kitty.

981
01:23:13,099 --> 01:23:16,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were an initial five more DLC.

982
01:23:16,982 --> 01:23:21,785
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a survivor, expanded the survivor mode with new features.

983
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:25,367
[SPEAKER_01]: A season pass to these could be purchased.

984
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:29,009
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also Corporate Lockdown, where you would play as

985
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Different corporate people that you just hear from in the periphery.

986
01:23:33,853 --> 01:23:39,037
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one called Trauma that had a new character you could use on different maps.

987
01:23:39,037 --> 01:23:51,946
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Safe Haven with another new character that, you know, basically they're just like NPCs through the normal one or background characters and you get to play as them and see what their story was.

988
01:23:51,946 --> 01:23:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: The game had really, I mean,

989
01:23:55,909 --> 01:24:01,894
[SPEAKER_01]: It had pretty positive reviews, although some people were just like, meh about it, and I don't know why.

990
01:24:01,894 --> 01:24:04,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's really good.

991
01:24:04,176 --> 01:24:11,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the design in it was very well received.

992
01:24:11,361 --> 01:24:15,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly one of the talking points.

993
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:19,547
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people just did not care for how difficult the game was.

994
01:24:19,547 --> 01:24:22,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Even easy, the game is very difficult.

995
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:45,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It did win some awards, PC Gamers Game of the Year 2014, Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards, Best Audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards, and four awards at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviews.

996
01:24:45,104 --> 01:24:49,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got tons of accolades.

997
01:24:52,785 --> 01:25:08,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the sales were weak of the game, Creative Assembly did want to do a sequel, but then most of the team that worked on the game was no longer at Creative Assembly and they were working on a first-person shooter.

998
01:25:08,497 --> 01:25:13,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were the comic book sequels, Aliens Resistance and Alien Rescue, both came out in 2019.

999
01:25:15,703 --> 01:25:21,966
[SPEAKER_01]: A spin-off by D3Go called Alien Blackout was put out on mobile devices.

1000
01:25:21,966 --> 01:25:29,749
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out in January 2019, but it was shut down on October 31st of this past year.

1001
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:36,957
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a pinball video game adaptation.

1002
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:47,890
[SPEAKER_01]: In Aliens vs. Pinball, there is a mode for alien isolation, there's a novelization, and a streaming television series that was released on IGN.

1003
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:50,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked a doozy but it was worth talking about.

1004
01:26:13,337 --> 01:26:13,777
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

1005
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:15,979
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was the aesthetics of it.

1006
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:22,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just was like, they've nailed this freaking universe.

1007
01:26:22,002 --> 01:26:32,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with, you know, just how sort of thinking of just nefarious the Weyland-Yutani Corporation was in dealing with this situation.

1008
01:26:32,309 --> 01:26:35,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, we want this.

1009
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:37,932
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to buy your company or buy your station.

1010
01:26:37,932 --> 01:26:38,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now us.

1011
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:40,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything on it is our property.

1012
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:45,194
[SPEAKER_01]: and just the way that it ends, that isolation.

1013
01:26:46,457 --> 01:26:50,720
[SPEAKER_01]: You really, really feel alone in this game.

1014
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:56,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you've got other people, you're spending a lot of time going off on your own.

1015
01:26:56,063 --> 01:26:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ports that I forgot to mention.

1016
01:26:58,025 --> 01:27:07,631
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Linux and OS X versions, which I'm sure is still going on the current Mac OS.

1017
01:27:07,631 --> 01:27:12,194
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Switch version in 2019 and then an Android and iOS version from 2021.

1018
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:16,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also available on Amazon Luna.

1019
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:31,272
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I know you're heading out, so any final thoughts for us tonight before Ranma and I run through the news?

1020
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry to leave you guys.

1021
01:27:34,346 --> 01:27:38,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, if I could keep my head up, I would.

1022
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:40,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you for the hearts, Ran-chan.

1023
01:27:40,827 --> 01:27:42,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I am doing hearts back.

1024
01:27:42,928 --> 01:27:45,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ucha.

1025
01:27:45,488 --> 01:27:51,069
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to thank Ran-chan for my Kyoto mug from Starbucks.

1026
01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:52,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

1027
01:27:52,049 --> 01:27:55,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very pretty and I will never drink out of it.

1028
01:27:55,650 --> 01:28:01,011
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going up with my Sakura mug from one of the other locations.

1029
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:11,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little like a child size sippy cup that's got Sakura all over it and I'm not ever taking it out of the box.

1030
01:28:11,177 --> 01:28:12,598
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1031
01:28:12,598 --> 01:28:16,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just also want to thank you.

1032
01:28:16,019 --> 01:28:31,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling emotional, so I just want to thank all of our listeners and all of our friends and everybody for helping us make it through to this this year, because, I mean, it'd be really terrible if we're just talking to no one.

1033
01:28:32,844 --> 01:28:34,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking to all y'all.

1034
01:28:34,425 --> 01:28:35,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

1035
01:28:35,705 --> 01:28:35,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearts.

1036
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:37,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1037
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:40,007
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always been at least one person we've been talking to from the very beginning.

1038
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:42,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, definitely appreciate the listeners.

1039
01:28:42,347 --> 01:28:44,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate appreciate that for sure.

1040
01:28:44,468 --> 01:28:45,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So all right.

1041
01:28:45,248 --> 01:28:48,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as for me, it's over.

1042
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,170
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1043
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:50,550
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1044
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:51,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Rest up.

1045
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:52,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel better.

1046
01:28:52,331 --> 01:28:53,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Tater taters.

1047
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:53,591
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1048
01:28:53,591 --> 01:28:54,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1049
01:28:54,172 --> 01:28:55,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1050
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:55,732
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1051
01:28:55,732 --> 01:28:57,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about that, Ranma?

1052
01:28:57,573 --> 01:28:58,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

1053
01:28:58,393 --> 01:29:00,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's just you and me running this show.

1054
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:03,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we belong.

1055
01:29:03,651 --> 01:29:09,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever seen the movie Air America?

1056
01:29:09,154 --> 01:29:09,934
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1057
01:29:09,934 --> 01:29:10,474
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get there.

1058
01:29:10,474 --> 01:29:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get through the news.

1059
01:29:11,235 --> 01:29:12,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't you why don't you start us off?

1060
01:29:12,896 --> 01:29:14,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us what's going on.

1061
01:29:14,697 --> 01:29:22,161
[SPEAKER_06]: You shared this one to our Discord server, which, by the way, if you want to talk news with us throughout the week, VOG Network dot com slash Discord is the place to be.

1062
01:29:22,161 --> 01:29:27,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I caught that you shared this one, and this is the latest in a disturbing trend, right?

1063
01:29:27,103 --> 01:29:28,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very.

1064
01:29:28,484 --> 01:29:28,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1065
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:42,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt kind of emotional when I was, first when I was seeing like people posting photos of Best Buys ripping out the game sections or seeing just empty shelves.

1066
01:29:42,764 --> 01:29:47,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like, I can't believe this is actually happening.

1067
01:29:47,005 --> 01:29:50,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand not everybody buys from Best Buy.

1068
01:29:50,926 --> 01:29:52,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone has their place, but for me,

1069
01:29:53,174 --> 01:29:56,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And living in New York City, Best Buy is more convenient for me to go and do my shopping.

1070
01:29:56,817 --> 01:29:59,600
[SPEAKER_05]: But for some people, it's Walmart.

1071
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:05,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And now what we're discovering is that Walmart is removing video games from their stores.

1072
01:30:05,425 --> 01:30:06,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're starting with...

1073
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:16,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a way, the stories coming out, it doesn't make sense, but at the same time it does.

1074
01:30:16,631 --> 01:30:21,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, Microsoft told Walmart to remove the game.

1075
01:30:21,394 --> 01:30:24,536
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been no proof that that was said.

1076
01:30:24,536 --> 01:30:26,058
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that this is what's happening.

1077
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:35,266
[SPEAKER_05]: as there was a memo that came out that talked about them removing the physical copies of the game from its platform and no longer sell it.

1078
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:40,410
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're lucky, you might be able to find a copy for three cents as it's being marked down.

1079
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:47,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Stores aren't supposed to sell it, but if you get lucky, it's your three cents worth.

1080
01:30:47,256 --> 01:30:47,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1081
01:30:48,633 --> 01:31:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it would be very well, you know, you know, who's gonna celebrate this news if you know, again, this is kind of just like one instance, but it definitely if you can't help but feel like, oh, this is the latest in a trend, but you know, who's gonna fucking celebrate this news?

1082
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,142
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, who's so fucking happy about this?

1083
01:31:06,142 --> 01:31:06,622
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop.

1084
01:31:09,155 --> 01:31:22,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, as these other places that sell the physical media is going away, GameStop now and granted I and to be fair, many people, you know, many GameStops have scaled back on that too.

1085
01:31:22,165 --> 01:31:27,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know GameStops sell a lot of other crap than just video games at this point.

1086
01:31:27,509 --> 01:31:31,810
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming like NerdStop or GeekStop with all of the stuff that they're selling.

1087
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:37,691
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, but yeah, but GameStop kind of got done in by Walmart in some ways.

1088
01:31:37,691 --> 01:31:44,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's interesting if Walmart does start to scale back on this because, you know, square footage inside of Walmart is valuable.

1089
01:31:44,413 --> 01:31:50,114
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's other stuff they want to put in there, then, you know, phone accessories or whatever it is they're going to put in there, then so be it.

1090
01:31:50,114 --> 01:31:55,436
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, this is definitely this is

1091
01:31:57,046 --> 01:32:03,128
[SPEAKER_06]: This, I don't want to say this is the end of physical media, but it's starting to feel like shit.

1092
01:32:03,128 --> 01:32:05,529
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, this is getting real.

1093
01:32:05,529 --> 01:32:08,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Like physical media is dwindling.

1094
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:12,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, let me tell you back in the, I think it was mid to late 2000.

1095
01:32:12,871 --> 01:32:13,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1096
01:32:13,392 --> 01:32:23,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to work as a rep for Best Buy and I would go in, I would do inventory of certain titles, pack out certain movies and DVDs and so forth.

1097
01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:25,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would go into different stores and I would just see like,

1098
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:35,129
[SPEAKER_05]: rows and columns of DVDs and Blu-rays, and when I started, it was a small section for VHS tapes.

1099
01:32:35,129 --> 01:32:53,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I go into a Best Buy, it's just like these short shelves, and it's like maybe four or five, and it's like the top sellers, this is what's out this week, and that's it.

1100
01:32:53,656 --> 01:32:54,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look, and it's like,

1101
01:32:56,223 --> 01:33:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing here that I really care about, so I'm just gonna do what everybody else does.

1102
01:33:01,705 --> 01:33:04,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I will just order it off of Amazon.

1103
01:33:04,826 --> 01:33:08,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be the other one celebrating what's happening at Walmart, to be honest.

1104
01:33:08,187 --> 01:33:10,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do know this.

1105
01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:15,549
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still gonna be selling physical games online, which is where I deal with the bulk of my shopping.

1106
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:17,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I just be like, you know what?

1107
01:33:17,689 --> 01:33:22,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I will just swing by this location after work, because it's along the way, pick it up, and go home.

1108
01:33:24,531 --> 01:33:26,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's move on to our next story.

1109
01:33:26,492 --> 01:33:32,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, part of the reason I'm I'm starting to pick it up tonight show just might be cursed, Rama and I swear it's not your fault.

1110
01:33:32,597 --> 01:33:36,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's I'm going to show this for those that are watching on the stream tonight.

1111
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:43,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I sort of point out that big cell of red rain is headed right this direction.

1112
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:49,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And I I would I wouldn't be shocked if this power just fucking goes out middle of the show.

1113
01:33:49,969 --> 01:33:51,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that's if that ends up happening,

1114
01:33:54,076 --> 01:33:57,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rob, let me tell you.

1115
01:33:57,158 --> 01:33:59,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, Twitch serves as a backup.

1116
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:01,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those days are over.

1117
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's yeah, it's one of those days, that's for sure.

1118
01:34:04,122 --> 01:34:05,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, let me tell you.

1119
01:34:05,563 --> 01:34:18,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if the if the people who are participating with us haven't noticed my arm going behind me because I have a heater back here that I've been switching off and on because it is a nice crisp

1120
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:32,846
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 degrees outside, and the insulation of this studio isn't the best in the world, which is why there is a curtain here, because I can stick my hand through the curtain and feel Frosty the Snowman give me a high five.

1121
01:34:32,846 --> 01:34:33,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yikes.

1122
01:34:33,786 --> 01:34:34,226
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1123
01:34:34,226 --> 01:34:35,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, stay warm in there.

1124
01:34:35,787 --> 01:34:46,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Smush would love your little heat thing, by the way, because, you know, Mr. Smush's place, my cat, for those who don't know, do you know Mr. Smush's favorite place to relax?

1125
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:47,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the oven.

1126
01:34:48,032 --> 01:35:07,730
[SPEAKER_06]: he will get into a little spot between the oven and the counter like when the oven is running mind you but it's don't worry he's fine he's a mod it's a modern oven it's contained in a thing he's wasn't safe there but he'll be because the hot air is blowing out of it he loves to curl up in a little ball right by there just get soak in that hot air that's love

1127
01:35:08,223 --> 01:35:09,124
[SPEAKER_06]: He could listen to this show.

1128
01:35:09,124 --> 01:35:10,624
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of hot air on this show, too.

1129
01:35:10,624 --> 01:35:12,105
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1130
01:35:12,105 --> 01:35:13,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

1131
01:35:13,226 --> 01:35:14,526
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1132
01:35:14,526 --> 01:35:15,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrible.

1133
01:35:15,207 --> 01:35:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the Microsoft Developer Direct.

1134
01:35:18,028 --> 01:35:23,511
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a big little to do this week and they made some updates on some games.

1135
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Avowed is one game that has been on many people's radar.

1136
01:35:26,873 --> 01:35:31,315
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be it's confirmed that it is coming to Game Pass and it is coming out this fall.

1137
01:35:31,315 --> 01:35:35,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Avowed is one of those games that we kind of got a little bit of a taste of previously from Obsidian.

1138
01:35:36,338 --> 01:35:38,840
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was nice to see a little bit more of that.

1139
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:42,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm into this, and the fact that it's on Game Pass is a huge win.

1140
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:47,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, again, with everything we talked about, you know, with PAL World earlier in the show, Game Pass is the only reason.

1141
01:35:47,548 --> 01:35:50,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if I was going to pay $30 to check that out, I probably wouldn't have.

1142
01:35:50,851 --> 01:35:52,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Pass is the reason why I did.

1143
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:56,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice to see The Devout is coming to Game Pass.

1144
01:35:56,175 --> 01:36:02,741
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think just about everything they were talking about was Game Pass related, which is very typical for Microsoft and their events.

1145
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:03,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally,

1146
01:36:03,962 --> 01:36:06,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Senua's Saga Hellblade 2.

1147
01:36:06,546 --> 01:36:07,187
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a date.

1148
01:36:08,134 --> 01:36:14,958
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a date they're finally after all these teasers over all these years we finally know May 21st, which is that's pretty good.

1149
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:17,120
[SPEAKER_06]: That means it's summer not holiday.

1150
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:22,823
[SPEAKER_06]: May 21st $50 game, which kind of surprised me.

1151
01:36:22,823 --> 01:36:25,965
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going full but I don't know if it's because a little bit shorter of a game.

1152
01:36:25,965 --> 01:36:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first game was not super long, but it's only $50.

1153
01:36:30,808 --> 01:36:33,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the interesting twist.

1154
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It is digital only.

1155
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:38,922
[SPEAKER_06]: along the same lines of what Ranma was just saying.

1156
01:36:38,922 --> 01:36:43,503
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a digital only for such a for a game that they've been hyping so fucking long.

1157
01:36:43,503 --> 01:36:45,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Digital only.

1158
01:36:45,143 --> 01:36:46,783
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this this is the thing.

1159
01:36:46,783 --> 01:36:51,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, Game Pass has saved me so much money since I've had it.

1160
01:36:51,765 --> 01:36:54,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, this is something I hear from people all the time.

1161
01:36:54,665 --> 01:36:58,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why are digital games just as expensive as physical games?

1162
01:36:58,926 --> 01:37:02,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you know this, but years back,

1163
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:11,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital counterparts were a lot cheaper, but the big retailers were like, if you don't bring the prices up, we're not going to carry your games into stores.

1164
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:14,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Visions of Mana

1165
01:37:39,008 --> 01:37:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty exciting as well.

1166
01:37:40,809 --> 01:37:51,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the mana reboots have done... The first mana reboot was kind of eh, but then the trials of mana ended up pretty good, and I think folks are excited for this one as well.

1167
01:37:51,638 --> 01:38:00,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Ara, History Untold is another game that they were teasing, which I kind of think is their answer to Civilization of sorts.

1168
01:38:00,185 --> 01:38:03,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a 4X kind of game, so that could be interesting.

1169
01:38:03,727 --> 01:38:05,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle

1170
01:38:21,743 --> 01:38:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle

1171
01:38:38,782 --> 01:38:50,752
[SPEAKER_06]: One other thing that some very eagle-eyed people were catching, uh, is that apparently the developer direct had a segment about puzzles.

1172
01:38:50,752 --> 01:39:01,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the background, there was a quake symbol with texts that said A-K-E-6 that was written in the foreground.

1173
01:39:01,961 --> 01:39:02,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1174
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:20,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't know why there would be a Quake 6 before a Quake 5, but maybe, I don't know, I would think a Quake reboot in this realm of something like Doom and how that all went would be a little more likely, but who knows.

1175
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:21,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that is something.

1176
01:39:21,851 --> 01:39:22,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're trolling us.

1177
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:23,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1178
01:39:23,952 --> 01:39:25,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe it's just a big troll.

1179
01:39:25,072 --> 01:39:26,133
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be too.

1180
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:26,413
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1181
01:39:27,954 --> 01:39:35,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about Tekken 8 because we'd brought up previously some issues with accessibility or actually some neat things that they are doing with accessibility.

1182
01:39:35,816 --> 01:39:40,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're making some changes based on feedback that's already come in with that accessibility.

1183
01:39:40,617 --> 01:39:47,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So folks that were testing the colorblind features were saying, Oh, we're getting vertigo and migraines.

1184
01:39:47,498 --> 01:39:50,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tekken director, or Tekken 8 director,

1185
01:39:51,119 --> 01:40:00,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Katsuhiro Harada responded and said folks have misunderstood the accessibility options, saying it weren't meant to be useful for all the colorblind players.

1186
01:40:00,883 --> 01:40:06,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that seems kind of like a kick in the butt, but he does clarify it was a work in progress.

1187
01:40:06,966 --> 01:40:13,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We've tweaked that quite a bit to address some of the issues and make sure that it works better for a wider variety of people.

1188
01:40:13,929 --> 01:40:41,061
[SPEAKER_06]: the updated versions will be added to the retail game and the demo we just don't know when but it is worth pointing out Tekken 8 comes out oh this week January the 26th so it's right around the corner so neat uh oh Rama this is uh this is uh this is the end of an era right yeah it is and i was just kind of shocked by that you know i i just never would have expected it but

1189
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:44,726
[SPEAKER_05]: As the saying goes, all good things come to an end.

1190
01:40:44,726 --> 01:40:51,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I mean is, the very last batch of Rock Band 4 DLC comes out.

1191
01:40:51,717 --> 01:40:54,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to drop on Thursday the 25th.

1192
01:40:55,726 --> 01:41:05,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And this happens to follow the Harmonix launch of Fortnite Festival, which is a game similar to Rock Band, but just playable within Fortnite, which to me kind of makes sense.

1193
01:41:05,595 --> 01:41:13,303
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're putting all this effort into this new game, they're going to probably need a team that was working on Rock Band to kind of get it done.

1194
01:41:13,303 --> 01:41:15,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they charge way more for the DLC in Fortnite Festivals.

1195
01:41:15,805 --> 01:41:16,606
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the money's at.

1196
01:41:17,918 --> 01:41:19,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you wanna know something?

1197
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:19,440
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1198
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:19,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

1199
01:41:37,589 --> 01:41:39,490
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't either.

1200
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:42,411
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the here's the in all seriousness, it is still sad.

1201
01:41:42,411 --> 01:41:44,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know like Rock Band 4 was was good.

1202
01:41:44,792 --> 01:41:49,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, there's people that, you know, miss the plastic instrument parties and all that stuff.

1203
01:41:49,794 --> 01:41:53,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And PogCulture in chat says, I want Rock Band 5, damn it.

1204
01:41:53,156 --> 01:41:54,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

1205
01:41:54,976 --> 01:41:58,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to make a Fortnite account if you want to play it, because that's that's it.

1206
01:41:58,318 --> 01:41:59,418
[SPEAKER_06]: For better or for worse.

1207
01:41:59,418 --> 01:42:00,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you got now.

1208
01:42:00,679 --> 01:42:03,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember years ago,

1209
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,702
[SPEAKER_05]: playing Rock Band on the Xbox 360.

1210
01:42:06,702 --> 01:42:08,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It was me.

1211
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:10,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It was DarkTetsuya.

1212
01:42:10,365 --> 01:42:11,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Misty.

1213
01:42:11,506 --> 01:42:16,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who the fourth person was, but we would just get together and just start jamming.

1214
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,932
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had a grand old time, you know?

1215
01:42:19,412 --> 01:42:21,754
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the Fortnite Festival, it's all right.

1216
01:42:21,754 --> 01:42:23,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It brings the spirit, except you don't actually sing.

1217
01:42:23,995 --> 01:42:26,297
[SPEAKER_06]: The singing is also keystrokes.

1218
01:42:26,297 --> 01:42:28,238
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's similar to guitar or whatever.

1219
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Fortnite Festival is fine.

1220
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it got me to install Fortnite and check it out.

1221
01:42:33,421 --> 01:42:36,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are adding new songs into Fortnite Festival.

1222
01:42:36,163 --> 01:42:38,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It's slow, but they do it.

1223
01:42:38,365 --> 01:42:39,305
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on Thursday.

1224
01:42:39,305 --> 01:42:45,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think like Bastille, the... Pompeii, was that the name of the song?

1225
01:42:45,369 --> 01:42:46,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was the song that came out this week.

1226
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:49,092
[SPEAKER_06]: That one other song came out.

1227
01:42:50,035 --> 01:42:52,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that song in Rock Band as well as DLC?

1228
01:42:53,761 --> 01:42:56,302
[SPEAKER_06]: After all these years, I would imagine.

1229
01:42:56,302 --> 01:43:09,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming what they're doing is going back to the companies and renegotiating the licenses on the song so they can slowly move them from Rock Band to Fortnite.

1230
01:43:09,789 --> 01:43:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't quite go one for one because many of the key patterns are four.

1231
01:43:13,931 --> 01:43:16,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you play on Expert, then it's five.

1232
01:43:16,492 --> 01:43:20,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And then again, vocals have to be keyed because they don't play like they did in Rock Band.

1233
01:43:20,814 --> 01:43:21,134
[SPEAKER_06]: But

1234
01:43:21,575 --> 01:43:24,242
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1235
01:43:28,936 --> 01:43:32,797
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's yeah, it does feel very like end of an era.

1236
01:43:32,797 --> 01:43:37,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get that fortnight festival is still because let's be real, like, as much as I say, it's fun.

1237
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:37,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

1238
01:43:37,998 --> 01:43:38,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

1239
01:43:38,978 --> 01:43:42,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they're like five, they want 500 v bucks.

1240
01:43:42,599 --> 01:43:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like five bucks for one fucking song.

1241
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a battle pass and some songs like if you want Gangnam style, that's only in or you want Poison by Belle de Vivre Devoe.

1242
01:43:53,922 --> 01:43:55,563
[SPEAKER_06]: What an iconic song.

1243
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:56,783
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to get the battle pass.

1244
01:43:57,603 --> 01:44:02,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And to that I say, no, I won't.

1245
01:44:02,405 --> 01:44:05,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So now they do have the free song rotation.

1246
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:09,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of something that you know, rock band didn't have is that you get to rotate in that stuff.

1247
01:44:09,549 --> 01:44:10,509
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

1248
01:44:10,509 --> 01:44:15,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's, it's not the same as rock band.

1249
01:44:15,992 --> 01:44:20,254
[SPEAKER_06]: But sadly, it's they're going to get the plastic they are working on the plastic instrument support.

1250
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will be interesting when they get that in.

1251
01:44:21,795 --> 01:44:22,255
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be cool.

1252
01:44:22,657 --> 01:44:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice.

1253
01:44:23,598 --> 01:44:32,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, maybe they can actually do another production run of that very expensive rock band adapter that's going for anywhere between $300 and $500 on Amazon.

1254
01:44:32,371 --> 01:44:34,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

1255
01:44:34,815 --> 01:44:36,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

1256
01:44:36,607 --> 01:44:47,689
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, a lot of fans very excited to hear this because Sony is going to be making a movie out of one of their surprise hits from a few years ago, Until Dawn.

1257
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:50,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Until Dawn, which came out in 2015.

1258
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:54,311
[SPEAKER_06]: My goodness, I didn't realize that game was hitting about nine years old as well.

1259
01:44:54,311 --> 01:44:56,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be getting a movie adaptation.

1260
01:44:56,031 --> 01:45:01,852
[SPEAKER_06]: David Sandberg, who made the Shazam movies and Lights Out, is going to be directing this.

1261
01:45:01,852 --> 01:45:04,973
[SPEAKER_06]: The script is coming from Gary Dauberman.

1262
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:07,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Annabelle Creations

1263
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:44,385
[SPEAKER_06]: technically you can play through the game and just about everybody lives I don't want to spoil but like there's like kind of certain people that have to die but then you can also play through the game and like everybody dies so it'll be interesting to see how they kind of do that choose your own adventure for the movie I

1264
01:45:45,126 --> 01:45:50,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know, like I'm of a couple of mindsets because I'm like, yeah, the people are really into the story.

1265
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good horror thing.

1266
01:45:51,528 --> 01:45:53,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think the movie will be good.

1267
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:57,830
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm also kind of like, but the the game stands, you don't need a movie.

1268
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:58,710
[SPEAKER_06]: The game exists.

1269
01:45:58,710 --> 01:46:00,791
[SPEAKER_06]: The game serves as the movie.

1270
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:02,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's of a quality enough.

1271
01:46:02,632 --> 01:46:04,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know.

1272
01:46:04,612 --> 01:46:08,634
[SPEAKER_06]: People still, you know, I guess you could say the same thing about The Last of Us and look, that TV show is

1273
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:11,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana's popular.

1274
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we'll see.

1275
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:14,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will say this.

1276
01:46:14,544 --> 01:46:18,387
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was coming back from Japan, I actually watched the Gran Turismo movie.

1277
01:46:18,387 --> 01:46:20,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot better than I thought it would be.

1278
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:22,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, true.

1279
01:46:22,491 --> 01:46:28,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw on chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says maybe they'll come up with an original story that doesn't follow the game story.

1280
01:46:28,677 --> 01:46:32,541
[SPEAKER_06]: That could I could see that that maybe they don't have like the same characters.

1281
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:34,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the plot is kind of similar.

1282
01:46:35,383 --> 01:46:38,024
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1283
01:47:04,975 --> 01:47:09,818
[SPEAKER_06]: If you read about like the reasons why Clue bombed the box office, it was because of that.

1284
01:47:09,818 --> 01:47:11,499
[SPEAKER_06]: It was because of the multiple endings.

1285
01:47:11,499 --> 01:47:22,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually did so much better on cable at the time, because, you know, in the mid 80s, in reruns, most of us grew up on that movie watching it on TV because they would show it with all three endings.

1286
01:47:22,025 --> 01:47:23,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were into that.

1287
01:47:23,566 --> 01:47:29,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could like we were able to suspend disbelief about, OK, sure, there's just three ways this thing ended.

1288
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:32,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's a silly comedy movie anyway.

1289
01:47:32,091 --> 01:47:33,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway.

1290
01:47:34,451 --> 01:47:35,612
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1291
01:47:35,612 --> 01:47:38,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I think it's neat.

1292
01:47:38,073 --> 01:47:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's, you know, especially if somebody who hosts, you know, horror related things, and I know I have my own nuanced takes on the genre, but I think this is going to be very interesting to see how this translates to a movie, especially if they end up wanting to do a franchise out of it.

1293
01:47:52,462 --> 01:47:57,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this mean they do the quarry and some of these other games, or do they try to make more stuff within the Until Dawn universe?

1294
01:47:57,965 --> 01:48:03,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you don't make a horror franchise in this day and age, if you're not thinking about a trilogy, at least.

1295
01:48:04,417 --> 01:48:04,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Bear.

1296
01:48:29,833 --> 01:48:40,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's talk about a pretty cool response from Nintendo to a really tragic earthquake that happened in the Noto Peninsula.

1297
01:48:40,019 --> 01:48:47,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is actually donating 50 million yen to the Japanese Red Cross, and they're also going to be doing some free repairs.

1298
01:48:47,963 --> 01:48:52,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a translated version of Nintendo's statement.

1299
01:48:52,005 --> 01:48:57,668
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone who is affected by the 2020 Noto Peninsula earthquake.

1300
01:48:57,668 --> 01:48:58,469
[SPEAKER_06]: We will provide

1301
01:48:59,389 --> 01:48:59,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Repairs

1302
01:49:16,377 --> 01:49:20,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We will provide free repairs for our products requested by people in areas where the Disaster Relief Act applies in response

1303
01:49:41,721 --> 01:49:45,922
[SPEAKER_06]: for a period of six months from the application of the Disaster Relief Act in each region.

1304
01:49:45,922 --> 01:49:52,564
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, we will donate 50 million yen through the Japanese Red Cross Society to support those affected by the disaster.

1305
01:49:52,564 --> 01:50:00,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding repair requests from areas covered by the law following the earthquake, please also see more information.

1306
01:50:01,549 --> 01:50:06,432
[SPEAKER_06]: It should also be pointed out that SEGA is also doing something.

1307
01:50:06,432 --> 01:50:09,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, obviously, there's no hardware on SEGA's end.

1308
01:50:09,153 --> 01:50:09,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad.

1309
01:50:09,693 --> 01:50:18,177
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've donated the equivalent of about $135,000 towards charity efforts in the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake.

1310
01:50:18,177 --> 01:50:18,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right here.

1311
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:20,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, I thought that happened not that long ago.

1312
01:50:20,839 --> 01:50:24,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think that's a mistranslation error that's happening on Twitter.

1313
01:50:24,721 --> 01:50:26,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter broken?

1314
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:26,762
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't say.

1315
01:50:28,255 --> 01:50:29,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Shocked, I tell you.

1316
01:50:29,476 --> 01:50:30,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not really shocked.

1317
01:50:30,577 --> 01:50:33,600
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, can we go back to something way earlier in the show?

1318
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I, can I call that?

1319
01:50:34,801 --> 01:50:36,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause, um, yes, yes.

1320
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:41,426
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole pal world stuff and the discourse around, well, the CEO said these stupid things.

1321
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:43,147
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, the game must have it.

1322
01:50:43,147 --> 01:50:52,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to remind everybody this, a majority of that discourse, cause I've seen some on blue sky, but the vast majority of that discourse about the CEO said something stupid.

1323
01:50:52,315 --> 01:50:54,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore we can't support it.

1324
01:50:54,257 --> 01:50:55,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming from Twitter.

1325
01:50:59,011 --> 01:51:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna just set that down, we'll walk away, and I'll let y'all think about that for a little bit.

1326
01:51:04,776 --> 01:51:07,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, Ranma, I was using the wrong shot, you were split in half there.

1327
01:51:07,638 --> 01:51:07,979
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1328
01:51:07,979 --> 01:51:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

1329
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:17,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you were doing that and talking about Twitter, the theme from Curb Your Enthusiasm just popped right into my head as if it was meant to be, because it makes so much sense.

1330
01:51:17,647 --> 01:51:18,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1331
01:51:18,647 --> 01:51:19,828
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1332
01:51:19,828 --> 01:51:25,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, moving on, let's, oh, this is, oh, so here's the thing.

1333
01:51:26,564 --> 01:51:31,705
[SPEAKER_06]: People are talking about how pissed they are about AI art and how they're not going to buy games that support it.

1334
01:51:31,705 --> 01:51:35,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And I totally get that, uh, depending on how the AI art was trained.

1335
01:51:35,286 --> 01:51:43,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, if it's trained on its own shit, that's different, but it seems to be the latest fad and the latest thing we're going to, we're going to gang up on the companies.

1336
01:51:43,708 --> 01:51:48,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's talk about the last thing we ganged up on the companies with Rama.

1337
01:51:48,109 --> 01:51:53,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, before we get into that, I want to touch on something regarding the earthquake.

1338
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember being home.

1339
01:51:57,081 --> 01:52:03,904
[SPEAKER_05]: My wristwatch, my smartwatch, vibrating like crazy at like three, four o'clock in the morning.

1340
01:52:03,904 --> 01:52:06,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just like, what the hell's going on?

1341
01:52:06,445 --> 01:52:08,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm checking and I see messages.

1342
01:52:08,746 --> 01:52:09,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you safe?

1343
01:52:09,567 --> 01:52:10,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you all right?

1344
01:52:10,507 --> 01:52:13,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you, I'm like, what the hell?

1345
01:52:13,288 --> 01:52:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea what was going on.

1346
01:52:15,589 --> 01:52:18,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to the computer, go on to Facebook.

1347
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:22,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause of course that's where you go to get your news instead of like CNN, you know, and,

1348
01:52:23,353 --> 01:52:24,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And lo and behold, Earthquake.

1349
01:52:24,914 --> 01:52:27,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh.

1350
01:52:27,215 --> 01:52:28,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1351
01:52:28,396 --> 01:52:33,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of the algorithm half the time, people thought I was still there.

1352
01:52:33,738 --> 01:52:43,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say one of my friends who I hung out with, she lives in Nagoya and she said she felt like the vibrations of where she was in the office, but it wasn't so bad.

1353
01:52:43,583 --> 01:52:50,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was, I would say she was at least four hours inlet from where it was.

1354
01:52:50,487 --> 01:53:01,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like what was really making the news here and maybe keep in mind, maybe it's because I'm in California, were the tsunami warnings and that element of it was, I feel like making the news pretty heavy too.

1355
01:53:01,633 --> 01:53:09,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's kind of like, I'm like, I thought that happened, you know, when the mistranslated tweet was throwing me, I was like, I remember hearing all of these tsunami things not that long ago.

1356
01:53:09,877 --> 01:53:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't that the same thing.

1357
01:53:11,458 --> 01:53:13,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's a lot of that here.

1358
01:53:13,959 --> 01:53:32,710
[SPEAKER_05]: and don't forget there was like a small earthquake out in California and then right after that an earthquake kind of hit us in New York because it popped up on the news about some explosion something happened at Roosevelt Island I'm just like nothing happens on Roosevelt Island I read the next day it was an earthquake I was like you know

1359
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:35,671
[SPEAKER_05]: This next story reminds me of an old saying.

1360
01:53:35,671 --> 01:53:36,892
[SPEAKER_05]: A fool and their money are soon parted.

1361
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:06,393
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm talking about is how GameStop is terminating their NFT marketplace.

1362
01:54:06,393 --> 01:54:09,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, who saw that coming?

1363
01:54:09,514 --> 01:54:15,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're basically saying that they're phasing out the marketplace due to regulatory uncertainty.

1364
01:54:15,518 --> 01:54:22,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but GameStop told their users that they have over two weeks remaining to use its platform.

1365
01:54:23,649 --> 01:54:33,534
[SPEAKER_05]: but yet the company assured the holders of their NFTs that the decision will not impact their NFTs, which remain accessible and saleable through other platforms.

1366
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:38,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're shutting it down, but you're able to- You can still show them off to all the people that don't give a shit.

1367
01:54:38,977 --> 01:54:39,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1368
01:54:41,872 --> 01:54:53,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the reasons why GameStop is doing this, they cited a lack of regulation as a reason for reducing their crypto initiatives, pointing out that continued regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space.

1369
01:54:53,576 --> 01:54:59,338
[SPEAKER_05]: The company's headquarters in the United States, where regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remain uncertain.

1370
01:54:59,338 --> 01:55:00,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

1371
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,479
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that now you can actually get...

1372
01:55:03,519 --> 01:55:14,178
[SPEAKER_05]: An RTX 3000 series graphics card or 4000 series graphics card at a reasonable price where you don't have to sell an arm and a leg should tell you something.

1373
01:55:16,244 --> 01:55:22,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's move on to another story we have here, which is, oh boy.

1374
01:55:22,188 --> 01:55:26,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I totally forgot that this game was coming out like this soon.

1375
01:55:26,871 --> 01:55:29,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know like Bobby Blackwolf is going to beat me up for saying that.

1376
01:55:29,393 --> 01:55:30,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's true.

1377
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:32,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I, I've seen this game obviously teased.

1378
01:55:32,615 --> 01:55:36,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I like thought this game was like a holiday holiday 20 day 2024 game.

1379
01:55:36,998 --> 01:55:39,540
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like a dragon, infinite wealth.

1380
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,641
[SPEAKER_06]: to the sequel to that game.

1381
01:55:41,641 --> 01:55:46,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I unfortunately did not finish because I get easily distracted by shiny things.

1382
01:55:46,004 --> 01:55:48,046
[SPEAKER_06]: But YouTube, well, you know, it happens.

1383
01:55:48,046 --> 01:55:48,967
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

1384
01:55:48,967 --> 01:55:50,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I still am taking an interest in the sequel.

1385
01:55:50,628 --> 01:55:55,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the sequel story is completely followable, whether I beat the original game or not.

1386
01:55:55,011 --> 01:55:57,473
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the sequel is coming this week.

1387
01:55:57,473 --> 01:55:58,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out.

1388
01:55:58,594 --> 01:56:03,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And to build hype for the game, they got XQC to stream the game.

1389
01:56:05,356 --> 01:56:24,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, I'm not gonna hate on the guy just because he's popular, because there's plenty of other reasons, but I'm just gonna say, I don't know why they teamed up with him, well they teamed up with him because he has all of these followers, he has, you know, all these people on, you know, the green site, and does he stream here too?

1390
01:56:24,726 --> 01:56:25,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like he does.

1391
01:56:26,887 --> 01:56:43,648
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think here's the thing he doesn't really care for role playing games and he's kind of like said that that he doesn't like and he's playing the game and when the game goes turn battle which by the way like a dragon as the mainline series is now the

1392
01:56:44,369 --> 01:56:47,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest parody if you will that is now the main series.

1393
01:56:47,613 --> 01:56:54,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's that it's not that more actiony old Yakuza game, but I have a fucking feeling xQc wouldn't know the goddamn difference anyway.

1394
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reality is because this is not his bread and butter.

1395
01:56:57,243 --> 01:56:59,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just find it very strange.

1396
01:57:01,038 --> 01:57:06,382
[SPEAKER_06]: that these folks didn't do a little more research on exactly what streamers were going to be doing this.

1397
01:57:06,382 --> 01:57:09,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just put it in front of the most popular one.

1398
01:57:09,104 --> 01:57:15,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of feel like that is, that's a dangerous slope because you know, when he's sitting there going, well, I don't know what this is.

1399
01:57:15,509 --> 01:57:15,929
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it going?

1400
01:57:15,929 --> 01:57:16,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1401
01:57:16,249 --> 01:57:17,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks silly.

1402
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:25,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's plenty of popular streamers who do play RPGs who are into this, who would, you know, probably love to play this to be quite honest.

1403
01:57:25,836 --> 01:57:27,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just, I don't know.

1404
01:57:27,378 --> 01:57:30,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's not, not a great marketing choice to be quite honest.

1405
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm trying not to be a hater, but I have no choice.

1406
01:57:34,163 --> 01:57:35,223
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, you're right.

1407
01:57:35,223 --> 01:57:46,252
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe they're trying to tap into expanding the market, getting people who play those types of shooters or whatever to check out something new, get them out of his own comfort zone.

1408
01:57:46,252 --> 01:57:47,873
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm thinking.

1409
01:57:47,873 --> 01:57:59,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be perfectly honest, the only time I've heard of XQC is the one time Linus from Linus Tech Tips went to his house to help rebuild his computer that he broke trying to build himself.

1410
01:57:59,261 --> 01:58:00,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

1411
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:08,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, yeah, TigerClaw in chat says they just look at who the most popular streamer is, and that's the name that pops up.

1412
01:58:08,994 --> 01:58:10,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1413
01:58:10,335 --> 01:58:26,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, QuestBuster does point out kind of one of the like bummers about this game is that this was pure marketing, just like the decision to lock New Game Plus behind the more expensive deluxe and ultimate editions of the game, which again, talk about choices like.

1414
01:58:26,225 --> 01:58:31,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the game is going to be fine, but I really wish companies would stop making choices

1415
01:58:32,554 --> 01:58:34,315
[SPEAKER_06]: to fuck everything up.

1416
01:58:34,315 --> 01:58:44,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a lot of hard work that goes into these things and we don't need these choices to fuck everything up.

1417
01:58:44,739 --> 01:58:47,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be on Game Pass eventually anyway, if you're willing to wait.

1418
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:55,043
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, again, I think the Yakuza and Like a Dragon fans would, you know, appreciate me saying, still check it out when it comes out.

1419
01:58:55,043 --> 01:58:58,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, these are the things we have to weigh.

1420
01:58:58,004 --> 01:58:58,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1421
01:58:59,761 --> 01:59:01,762
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, the game does come out this week.

1422
01:59:01,762 --> 01:59:13,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe a streamer that you like and appreciate will be streaming the game as opposed to somebody that's just popular and then you can come to your own conclusions about this game and if it is for you.

1423
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:20,936
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're gonna move on ahead since we already did the classic game of the week earlier in the show before DarkSakura went on her way.

1424
01:59:20,936 --> 01:59:24,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wonder if she's able to sleep with this pissing down rain outside.

1425
01:59:24,318 --> 01:59:26,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it doesn't pick up on my microphone with the noise gate, but it's

1426
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:28,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming down.

1427
01:59:28,791 --> 01:59:30,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, keep it.

1428
01:59:30,211 --> 01:59:31,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It's West Coast coming down.

1429
01:59:31,872 --> 01:59:32,973
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a difference.

1430
01:59:32,973 --> 01:59:33,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1431
01:59:33,273 --> 01:59:36,755
[SPEAKER_06]: When you live on this side of the Rockies, it's a different atmosphere.

1432
01:59:36,755 --> 01:59:41,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different, but it's, it's, it's California rain coming down right now.

1433
01:59:41,697 --> 01:59:42,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's pretty, pretty well.

1434
01:59:42,898 --> 01:59:44,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, DarkSakura's in chat still.

1435
01:59:44,339 --> 01:59:45,679
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Rob, I love rain.

1436
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:46,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I sleep better with hard rain.

1437
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:48,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Get off your phone.

1438
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:51,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to bed.

1439
01:59:51,883 --> 01:59:53,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes when I'm streaming.

1440
01:59:53,043 --> 01:59:54,324
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what doesn't help you sleep?

1441
01:59:54,324 --> 01:59:55,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing on your phone or your computer.

1442
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:08,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, listen, when I stream sometimes and the kids are screaming and yelling, I'm just like praying to the streaming gods that when I go back and do the edits, it is not heard.

1443
02:00:08,764 --> 02:00:11,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And 99% of the time it's not.

1444
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:15,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for some reason, the neighbor's dog starts barking.

1445
02:00:15,569 --> 02:00:18,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like.

1446
02:00:18,452 --> 02:00:19,713
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1447
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:24,636
[SPEAKER_06]: We have another few stories we want to touch on pretty quickly here, just some rapid fire headlines.

1448
02:00:24,636 --> 02:00:26,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So Rama, we'll go over to you.

1449
02:00:27,571 --> 02:00:30,954
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna talk about this game called Groove Coaster.

1450
02:00:30,954 --> 02:00:37,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that the game, Groove Coaster 4 Max, is going offline in April.

1451
02:00:37,619 --> 02:00:45,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that Taito announced that this is going to happen effective April 1st, 2020.

1452
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:48,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a long-awaited April Fool's joke, Taito?

1453
02:00:48,429 --> 02:00:51,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Please let me know now, that way we're all in on the joke.

1454
02:00:52,418 --> 02:00:54,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But according to them, they're going to shut the game down.

1455
02:00:54,841 --> 02:00:56,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Is April Fool's a thing in Japan?

1456
02:00:56,783 --> 02:01:00,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it is as much.

1457
02:01:00,146 --> 02:01:00,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1458
02:01:00,566 --> 02:01:02,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're on the Internet like everybody else.

1459
02:01:02,348 --> 02:01:04,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you have to kind of come across it there.

1460
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:05,852
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.

1461
02:01:05,852 --> 02:01:06,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1462
02:01:06,132 --> 02:01:10,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Some Japanese companies have kind of done jokes as well.

1463
02:01:10,617 --> 02:01:11,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So who knows?

1464
02:01:11,618 --> 02:01:11,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1465
02:01:11,898 --> 02:01:15,702
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's it's still announced in January, so it doesn't look not good.

1466
02:01:17,042 --> 02:01:21,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's shutting down April 1st, 2024, 6 a.m.

1467
02:01:21,704 --> 02:01:23,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Japanese Standard Time.

1468
02:01:23,746 --> 02:01:31,730
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rhythm Arcade game itself will be available after the date as long as the Arcade Center still retains its cabinet, so you have that.

1469
02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:39,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the game goes offline, you're not going to be able to record any play data with your Nesica card here.

1470
02:01:39,034 --> 02:01:44,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's going to happen is the extra mode and the difficulty levels for each songs will be all unlocked.

1471
02:01:44,697 --> 02:01:50,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no online connection, but everything that's in the game will be available for you to play.

1472
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:57,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will also be local versus mode if there are multiple cabinets there running the game, which is kind of cool.

1473
02:02:00,002 --> 02:02:02,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's talk a little bit about awesome games done quick.

1474
02:02:02,744 --> 02:02:09,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you were here earlier in the evening here at VOG Network, you heard Bobby Blackwolf talk a lot about this because he's involved with hosting.

1475
02:02:09,929 --> 02:02:16,893
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, ironically, talking about Yakuza and Like a Dragon, that's kind of one of the, you know, Froob is the speedrunner and is the real star of that.

1476
02:02:16,893 --> 02:02:23,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But Bobby has definitely become like the voice off screen that helps, you know, kind of narrate through that whole thing.

1477
02:02:23,798 --> 02:02:24,959
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a lot of fun to watch.

1478
02:02:25,379 --> 02:02:27,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1479
02:02:27,401 --> 02:02:28,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, share and subscribe!

1480
02:02:43,897 --> 02:02:50,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but from a technical perspective, it sounds like because they were doing like an A stage and a B stage this year, they had very little delays.

1481
02:02:50,683 --> 02:02:51,324
[SPEAKER_06]: They were getting through it.

1482
02:02:51,324 --> 02:02:52,965
[SPEAKER_06]: They had like extra speed runs.

1483
02:02:52,965 --> 02:03:05,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a, it was a well-oiled machine and that well-oiled machine raised two and a half million dollars raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, to which we give a hearty fuck cancer.

1484
02:03:05,697 --> 02:03:08,659
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great charity to be raising money for.

1485
02:03:08,659 --> 02:03:10,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's amazing.

1486
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:14,524
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1487
02:03:28,979 --> 02:03:33,340
[SPEAKER_06]: any god raising $10,000 for a charity is fucking impressive.

1488
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:35,201
[SPEAKER_06]: You get up to a number like 2.5 million.

1489
02:03:35,201 --> 02:03:36,221
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mind blowing.

1490
02:03:36,221 --> 02:03:41,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think any, anyone over there should be comparing to these other years where the economy was different.

1491
02:03:41,943 --> 02:03:43,043
[SPEAKER_06]: The environment was different.

1492
02:03:43,043 --> 02:03:47,064
[SPEAKER_06]: People were consuming more Twitch content because the pandemic yada, yada, yada.

1493
02:03:47,064 --> 02:03:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think that's an amazing number.

1494
02:03:48,905 --> 02:03:53,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did, they did this like, of course the dog running gyromite.

1495
02:03:53,726 --> 02:03:55,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1496
02:03:55,286 --> 02:03:56,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1497
02:03:56,167 --> 02:03:56,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Button.

1498
02:03:57,627 --> 02:04:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's, you know, that's, that's infamous right there.

1499
02:04:01,308 --> 02:04:03,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, that's great.

1500
02:04:03,489 --> 02:04:07,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That dog is the bestest boy on this planet.

1501
02:04:07,450 --> 02:04:09,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what was the other meme that came out of that?

1502
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:11,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

1503
02:04:11,631 --> 02:04:13,572
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other thing I'm hearing a lot of.

1504
02:04:13,572 --> 02:04:13,812
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1505
02:04:16,351 --> 02:04:20,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I also for that good news, I have some not so good news.

1506
02:04:20,136 --> 02:04:23,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is current layoff updates in the industry.

1507
02:04:23,821 --> 02:04:26,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that this is becoming a regular segment.

1508
02:04:26,424 --> 02:04:34,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we have actually a studio we talked about a lot on this show behavior, the creators of Dead by Daylight have confirmed they have laid off

1509
02:04:34,854 --> 02:04:37,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Less than 3% of the total workforce.

1510
02:04:37,795 --> 02:04:39,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it still sucks though.

1511
02:04:39,095 --> 02:04:42,556
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're one of that 3%, you know, you're not happy.

1512
02:04:42,556 --> 02:04:52,178
[SPEAKER_06]: They're blaming it on changing market conditions, saying, quote, recently changing market conditions necessitated adjusting the scope of several behavior projects.

1513
02:04:52,178 --> 02:04:56,499
[SPEAKER_06]: In these situations, our preference is always to reassign talent to other projects.

1514
02:04:56,499 --> 02:04:59,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, this option is not always available to us.

1515
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:02,561
[SPEAKER_06]: These departures represented less than 3% of our total workforce.

1516
02:05:03,866 --> 02:05:09,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like something got cancelled behind the scenes.

1517
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:12,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this has a goddamn thing to do with Dead by Daylight.

1518
02:05:12,093 --> 02:05:16,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget that Behaviour does other stuff too, like the dating sim.

1519
02:05:16,037 --> 02:05:19,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But also Meet Your Maker was a game they released last year.

1520
02:05:19,519 --> 02:05:23,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the fact that you probably forgot about that until I just mentioned it.

1521
02:05:23,743 --> 02:05:27,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately says a bit about the state of that game and so forth.

1522
02:05:27,705 --> 02:05:35,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think it's probably just other projects we didn't know about or maybe some things related to meet your maker.

1523
02:05:35,169 --> 02:05:35,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1524
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:37,571
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that is a bummer.

1525
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:39,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Our thoughts to those affected.

1526
02:05:39,512 --> 02:05:42,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, with some more cuts at Embracer.

1527
02:05:44,633 --> 02:05:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost Boys Interactive confirmed the news saying

1528
02:06:07,009 --> 02:06:09,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Headwinds facing the industry right now.

1529
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:14,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, this does mean we will separate from some of our team members, and we're working closely with those affected.

1530
02:06:14,712 --> 02:06:21,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We know this is a hard time for this talented and experienced group of people, and we'll provide support and assistance through this transition to those leaving.

1531
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:27,562
[SPEAKER_06]: again, I'm going to say I'm going to say this a lot this year, and I'm sorry in advance for being a broken record.

1532
02:06:27,562 --> 02:06:34,424
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope those affected can find that silver lining of the fact that video games are art.

1533
02:06:34,424 --> 02:06:37,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nothing stopping you from making art.

1534
02:06:37,025 --> 02:06:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is how some great

1535
02:06:39,006 --> 02:06:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: IndieGames

1536
02:06:54,645 --> 02:07:06,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Those that have the ability to band together and do that, I hope people are able to make diamonds out of this lump of coal news and the gaming industry as a result certainly wins as well.

1537
02:07:06,228 --> 02:07:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, some other comments coming in from our chat.

1538
02:07:09,129 --> 02:07:16,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster saying there are rumors that Piranha Bytes, an RPG dev known for their Gothic series, is allegedly threatened with closure.

1539
02:07:16,251 --> 02:07:17,592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a part of Embracer.

1540
02:07:18,432 --> 02:07:21,054
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt saying there's so many layoffs in tech right now.

1541
02:07:21,054 --> 02:07:22,935
[SPEAKER_06]: It just feels like it's never going to stop.

1542
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:25,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Google said they're going to have layoffs soon as well.

1543
02:07:25,076 --> 02:07:28,658
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just, it's, it's scary.

1544
02:07:28,658 --> 02:07:31,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, do we blame AI?

1545
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:35,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like there's more than just the AI thing going on here.

1546
02:07:35,803 --> 02:07:41,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you this right now, because the company I work for, this happened to us last year.

1547
02:07:41,006 --> 02:07:42,046
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened was,

1548
02:07:43,067 --> 02:07:50,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was the middle of 2022, they hired an efficiency company to see how things work and operate and so forth.

1549
02:07:50,271 --> 02:08:02,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And after everything was said and done in January, one of my co-workers who just came back from vacation was laid off and they gave him $5,000 in like compensation, whatever, and sent him on his way.

1550
02:08:02,939 --> 02:08:05,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they didn't realize is this office

1551
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:11,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Two on-site techs, the workload has been outlandish.

1552
02:08:11,975 --> 02:08:19,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We are getting stuff from the LA office that they need done, like inventory, and we're like, we'll get to it when we can.

1553
02:08:19,463 --> 02:08:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been times I have stayed late just to catch up for that work or whatever, and now we're being told that

1554
02:08:25,649 --> 02:08:27,832
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to bring a third person in.

1555
02:08:27,832 --> 02:08:36,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, these layoffs are coming from companies who are hiring these people to say, well, you have five people doing this role.

1556
02:08:36,922 --> 02:08:37,843
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need five.

1557
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:38,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You need four.

1558
02:08:38,744 --> 02:08:41,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And then fifth person gets let go and go somewhere else.

1559
02:08:41,667 --> 02:08:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you realize somewhere down the line, oh, we really need that fifth person after all.

1560
02:08:46,656 --> 02:08:54,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if some of this is pandemic related as well, perhaps that, you know, because like tech really changed during the pandemic and things really grew.

1561
02:08:54,420 --> 02:09:05,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of that tech is never going away, but you do see a lot of companies and a lot of society going back to normal, using my quotey fingers at this point, you know, the world will never be, but never be normal again.

1562
02:09:05,206 --> 02:09:12,490
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the most part, you know, you've got a lot of people that are going back to the office, not everybody, the place I work, I'm still very thankful is telework.

1563
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:14,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to agree with that.

1564
02:09:29,211 --> 02:09:38,397
[SPEAKER_05]: During the pandemic, Microsoft closed all of their stores except for five locations, and those are their experience centers.

1565
02:09:38,397 --> 02:09:45,601
[SPEAKER_05]: All the people that used to work in those stores, they were sent to work remotely to do support and so forth.

1566
02:09:45,601 --> 02:09:50,364
[SPEAKER_05]: As the trends changed and people started going back to work, they started letting those people go.

1567
02:09:50,364 --> 02:09:57,408
[SPEAKER_05]: A friend of mine, a former manager at Microsoft, was one of those people, and it took him about six months to find a brand new job.

1568
02:09:59,025 --> 02:10:04,728
[SPEAKER_05]: and he, let's just say he had to go through AI with his resume to make it look good enough for them to take a look and be like, you know what?

1569
02:10:04,728 --> 02:10:05,948
[SPEAKER_05]: We like you, you're hired.

1570
02:10:05,948 --> 02:10:07,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1571
02:10:07,969 --> 02:10:09,610
[SPEAKER_06]: AI to get by AI.

1572
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:11,110
[SPEAKER_06]: God, what is this world that we do?

1573
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:11,470
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1574
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:15,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I feel like such an old man sometimes, but just... Get off my lawn!

1575
02:10:15,472 --> 02:10:16,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

1576
02:10:16,433 --> 02:10:17,913
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1577
02:10:17,913 --> 02:10:23,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to applying for... It's like, you know, when my parents were like, why don't you look in the paper to find a job?

1578
02:10:23,776 --> 02:10:25,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Go open the paper and see who's hiring.

1579
02:10:28,083 --> 02:10:32,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The paper is now indeed Craigslist and all this other stuff.

1580
02:10:32,447 --> 02:10:38,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Every job I've had in my adult life since my very first one out of college, essentially ish.

1581
02:10:38,173 --> 02:10:43,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to get my whole history, but I found on LinkedIn.

1582
02:10:43,598 --> 02:10:51,486
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to jobs, I consider myself very lucky because I'm in a field of work where if I were to get laid off today, I'd find something within 30 days.

1583
02:10:54,454 --> 02:10:56,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't ever want that to happen.

1584
02:10:56,915 --> 02:11:00,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do feel like if shit happened, I'm like, I have a pretty unique skill set.

1585
02:11:00,456 --> 02:11:02,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably have to take a cut and pay.

1586
02:11:02,096 --> 02:11:06,657
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like I have a unique skill set that I could find somewhere else.

1587
02:11:06,657 --> 02:11:08,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just I really don't want that to happen.

1588
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:10,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's let's stop talking about it.

1589
02:11:10,278 --> 02:11:11,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, agreed, agreed, agreed.

1590
02:11:12,259 --> 02:11:18,447
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's let's talk about something a little happier and travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out soon.

1591
02:11:18,447 --> 02:11:21,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Rama, I apologize because Loki kind of just knows the link.

1592
02:11:21,631 --> 02:11:23,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So the one I gave you is like old.

1593
02:11:23,213 --> 02:11:26,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you do you have the current link or do you need some help here with U.S.

1594
02:11:26,236 --> 02:11:26,657
[SPEAKER_06]: releases?

1595
02:11:31,861 --> 02:11:34,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's getting in a boat and going around the fucking world.

1596
02:11:34,083 --> 02:11:35,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

1597
02:11:35,004 --> 02:11:36,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out in the U.S.

1598
02:11:36,485 --> 02:11:42,028
[SPEAKER_06]: this week, in January 23rd, I believe, we have for Windows, Graven.

[SPEAKER_06]: We have Under Night in Birth 2 for Windows, Switch, and PlayStation.

1605
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:10,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And then kind of the big releases for this week are on the 26th.

1606
02:12:10,154 --> 02:12:14,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about them both already, but if you forgot, that's Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth.

1607
02:12:14,418 --> 02:12:14,959
[SPEAKER_06]: and Tekken 8.

02:13:36,522 --> 02:13:41,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Toitsu is also out as well, because Tekken's not on the Switch.

1612
02:13:41,705 --> 02:13:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yggdra Union 3-in-1 Special Bundle is also out on Japan this week.

1613
02:13:47,047 --> 02:13:53,050

[SPEAKER_06]: You also have Aliens Dark Descent getting its release in Japan this week.

1615
02:13:57,532 --> 02:14:04,538
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're into Agatha Christie games, Agatha Christie Murder on the Orient Express gets a Japanese release on PlayStation 5 this week.

1616
02:14:04,538 --> 02:14:08,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's about it for Japanese releases.

1617
02:14:08,982 --> 02:14:10,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at the UK.

1618
02:14:13,789 --> 02:14:17,870
[SPEAKER_06]: which I'm not sure this site is going to work for me.

1619
02:14:17,870 --> 02:14:23,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So I may have to beg apologies to our UK fans that I'm not seeing.

1620
02:14:23,572 --> 02:14:25,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not seeing anything either.

1621
02:14:25,192 --> 02:14:25,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1622
02:14:25,732 --> 02:14:33,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the same thing where DarkSakura just kind of has a site that she uses, but I'm looking real quick to just see if maybe it's like a browser thing.

1623
02:14:33,174 --> 02:14:34,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hear.

1624
02:14:34,234 --> 02:14:35,015
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it is.

1625
02:14:35,015 --> 02:14:36,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I pulled it up in Edge and it works.

1626
02:14:36,715 --> 02:14:37,415
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

1627
02:14:37,415 --> 02:14:38,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sweet.

1628
02:14:38,416 --> 02:14:38,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1629
02:14:38,736 --> 02:14:39,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So coming out in Europe,

1630
02:14:41,181 --> 02:14:45,484
[SPEAKER_06]: on the 25th of January, Yu-Gi-Oh two player starter set.

1631
02:14:45,484 --> 02:14:46,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, those are cards.

1632
02:14:46,445 --> 02:14:47,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that on this list?

1633
02:14:47,806 --> 02:14:51,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevermind, those are cards.

1634
02:14:51,329 --> 02:14:53,550
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what happens when I'm all by myself.

1635
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:55,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not by myself, but you know.

1636
02:14:55,912 --> 02:15:01,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But the big releases, of course, the same shit I've already talked about, Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth, and Tekkade, you knew that.

1637
02:15:01,256 --> 02:15:06,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, The Walking Dead Destinies is out on the Switch in Europe this week.

1638
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:07,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

1639
02:15:09,147 --> 02:15:13,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, phew, that was a one man around the world trip.

1640
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:15,331
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

1641
02:15:15,331 --> 02:15:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, before we continue this, one of the games that you mentioned, Macross Shooting Insight, when this game was announced, there was drama regarding this game because of the US licensing of Macross.

1642
02:15:31,647 --> 02:15:32,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1643
02:15:32,268 --> 02:15:34,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me more.

1644
02:15:34,169 --> 02:15:36,772
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the characters in the U.S.

1645
02:15:36,772 --> 02:15:42,336
[SPEAKER_05]: version is missing from the Japanese version on the cover box, and that's Lin Min Mei.

1646
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:45,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And from my understanding it's because of

1647
02:15:47,622 --> 02:15:52,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Harmony Gold's hand-fisted rights on Robotech.

1648
02:15:52,986 --> 02:15:59,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Robotech is a combination of Macross, and Mostipiata, and a couple of other titles that was mixed together.

1649
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:03,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all, it's because of the licensing, and in recent years,

1650
02:16:04,212 --> 02:16:10,440
[SPEAKER_05]: They've come to the table and be like, we're finally going to release Original Macross in the US.

1651
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:12,542
[SPEAKER_05]: It's subtitled, but it's something.

1652
02:16:12,542 --> 02:16:19,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But because of all of this, that one character is not on the cover box of the American release of the game.

1653
02:16:19,571 --> 02:16:20,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1654
02:16:23,284 --> 02:16:24,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reminded of like a Ms.

1655
02:16:24,645 --> 02:16:35,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man thing where it's missing from all these collections because somebody different technically has the, but then, but then they will release it as its own thing and it's, it's weird.

1656
02:16:35,174 --> 02:16:39,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it's like, it's like the Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

1657
02:16:39,498 --> 02:16:46,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Some characters couldn't be in it because the licensing in the US, but they threw in some extra characters just to kind of make up for it.

1658
02:16:46,423 --> 02:16:47,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1659
02:16:47,064 --> 02:16:47,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild.

1660
02:16:48,525 --> 02:16:49,125
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1661
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:53,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is the part of the show where we want to invite your participation with us.

1662
02:16:53,788 --> 02:16:56,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the listener roundtable, and we invite your emails every week.

1663
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:59,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at orangeandreida.com.

02:16:59,031 --> 02:17:05,794
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone wants to call in, we can surely arrange that in our Discord server in the green room, vognetwork.com.

1665
02:17:05,794 --> 02:17:11,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, if you have any questions in chat or anything you want us to talk about, especially remember Ranma's here and just got back from Japan.

1666
02:17:11,457 --> 02:17:14,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not just got back, but we can do all of that.

1667
02:17:14,659 --> 02:17:16,420
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually do have an email tonight though.

1668
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:18,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will go ahead and take that away.

1669
02:17:18,781 --> 02:17:25,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send an email.

1670
02:17:25,405 --> 02:17:28,947
[SPEAKER_06]: This email comes to us from Elliot B. Always good to hear from our friend Elliot.

1671
02:17:28,947 --> 02:17:32,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to invite I want to invite the chatters and Rama to reply to this one too.

1672
02:17:32,629 --> 02:17:33,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll see why in a minute.

1673
02:17:34,363 --> 02:17:36,425
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1674
02:17:49,839 --> 02:17:56,866
[SPEAKER_06]: After last year's, I realized I actually enjoy having streams on, even if it's just background viewing.

1675
02:17:56,866 --> 02:18:01,691
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had a hard time finding any streamers I liked post-GDQ.

1676
02:18:01,691 --> 02:18:06,897
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the top channels on Twitch seemed, for lack of a better word, juvenile.

1677
02:18:06,897 --> 02:18:08,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just you.

1678
02:18:08,418 --> 02:18:11,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to try again and find new favorite streamers.

1679
02:18:11,762 --> 02:18:12,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any tips?

1680
02:18:13,595 --> 02:18:22,721
[SPEAKER_06]: My partner likes to have SimStreamer Little Simsion and I enjoy it too, but I think I'm more into the sorts of games featured on AGDQ.

1681
02:18:22,721 --> 02:18:28,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And to head off the obvious answers, I just subscribe to all of the OLR hosts' Twitch and YouTube channels.

1682
02:18:29,045 --> 02:18:29,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for that.

1683
02:18:29,685 --> 02:18:30,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1684
02:18:30,185 --> 02:18:32,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Elliot B. Well, thank you for that.

1685
02:18:32,606 --> 02:18:35,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a few suggestions for you, actually.

1686
02:18:35,046 --> 02:18:50,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, I don't know if you know, but the Games Done Quick stream, if that's the sort of thing you actually enjoy watching, they do content all year round because they you know, those those events that they do, the Awesome Games Done Quick, the Summer Games Done Quick, those are the tent poles essentially.

1687
02:18:50,289 --> 02:18:53,349
[SPEAKER_06]: But they will do like pretty much every night.

1688
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:57,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I see them live doing something on their stream and

1689
02:18:58,050 --> 02:19:06,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's, you know, kind of how they raise money in part to put the events on through bits and subs and things like that, and kind of keep that community going and you'll bring the speed running folks together.

1690
02:19:06,154 --> 02:19:09,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm imagining you're already following the channel.

1691
02:19:09,615 --> 02:19:15,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if you know, as far as like background noise goes, I think that's a really good thing to put on.

1692
02:19:17,319 --> 02:19:28,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, ZenMonkey11 kind of goes the direction I would actually recommend as well, who says, don't look for streamers you like, look for streams on hobbies and topics you like.

1693
02:19:28,011 --> 02:19:34,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And you asked for tips, and that would be my tip to you, is go into and look for games you kind of want to watch, right?

1694
02:19:34,458 --> 02:19:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, it's no secret with DarkSakura doing her Dead by Daylight streaming.

1695
02:19:39,021 --> 02:19:39,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played the game a little bit.

1696
02:19:39,901 --> 02:19:42,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to watch Dead by Daylight streams.

1697
02:19:42,222 --> 02:19:51,007
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I like that particular game is that the game cycle resets every 20-30 minutes, basically, because you're going into a new game, right?

1698
02:19:51,007 --> 02:19:56,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with something like Overwatch or those games, because I don't feel like I'm missing anything.

1699
02:19:56,110 --> 02:20:00,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas when I'm watching a narrative game, and I have watched those streams, especially when my friends stream them,

1700
02:20:01,533 --> 02:20:04,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's a little bit harder to like catch a game midway.

1701
02:20:04,754 --> 02:20:05,674
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1702
02:20:05,674 --> 02:20:08,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see things, you know, I think from the beginning.

1703
02:20:08,094 --> 02:20:10,535
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's that.

1704
02:20:10,535 --> 02:20:13,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby wanted to also give you the tip through our chat room.

1705
02:20:13,675 --> 02:20:20,356
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like someone on GDQ, they show their Twitch handle in the GDQ layout so you can find them.

1706
02:20:20,356 --> 02:20:24,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's also another good point is that if there were some personalities and people you liked, follow them.

1707
02:20:24,837 --> 02:20:29,038
[SPEAKER_06]: They would appreciate it because there's streamers of all sizes.

1708
02:20:29,778 --> 02:20:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: that stream in Games Done Quick.

1709
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:37,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, Bobby Blackwolf is a mid-sized streamer.

1710
02:20:37,383 --> 02:20:38,964
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we do here at VOG Network.

1711
02:20:38,964 --> 02:20:40,125
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot of good stuff.

1712
02:20:40,125 --> 02:20:45,848
[SPEAKER_06]: He's, you know, he's not like the small, small streamer, but he's middle road, we'll say.

1713
02:20:45,848 --> 02:20:50,771
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a lot of large streamers that also participate with GDQ.

1714
02:20:50,771 --> 02:20:58,196
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, I know one that I've been able to meet in person and, you know, is Enigma, Eternal Enigma, who was at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.

1715
02:20:58,556 --> 02:21:27,636
[SPEAKER_06]: great guy super nice guy and I've been in his Twitch channel and he's got hundreds of people popping off at different horror games he's very well received and popular and for good reason he's very animated and has like the soundboard and all that stuff that pops up and he's very he's a very good host I in fact I believe he's done the live hosting thing kind of thing like I have and I it's like I see you bro I see you like you you've got it like I see what you're doing there so you know but my point is with that is that you know especially with an event like Games Done Quick people kind of

1716
02:21:28,416 --> 02:21:31,419
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to check their egos at the door because it's for charity.

1717
02:21:31,419 --> 02:21:36,063
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's certain people that would never do Games Done Quick because they have to check their egos at the door.

1718
02:21:36,063 --> 02:21:37,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll leave it at that.

1719
02:21:37,584 --> 02:21:44,130
[SPEAKER_06]: But the people that do Games Done Quick, you know, they're of a certain cloth where they're willing to, like, kind of like put that stuff aside.

1720
02:21:44,130 --> 02:21:44,930
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1721
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:45,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1722
02:21:45,931 --> 02:21:53,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is, of course, shouting out his pal Froob, who did the Yakuza and Like a Dragon speedrun, and pretty much anything related to that, you've probably seen Froob on.

1723
02:21:53,534 --> 02:22:04,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, Froob seems like a great... I don't know him as well as Bobby does, but just from, you know, again, having it on in the background and picking things up seems like a delight, for sure.

1724
02:22:04,758 --> 02:22:06,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's great.

1725
02:22:06,299 --> 02:22:08,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also say... Yeah, please.

1726
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:24,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also say, you know, maybe this will help, like, if you have any favorite video games you've played in the past, go on Twitch and see if anybody's playing them, you know, if you know the game pretty well, have it in the background and just hear them go through the game and see if they enjoy it, or...

1727
02:22:25,916 --> 02:22:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: See if there's any voice actors that are doing Twitch streams.

1728
02:22:30,761 --> 02:22:36,266
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my friends, Michelle Knotts, she did a complete Twitch stream.

1729
02:22:36,266 --> 02:22:39,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget how long it took, but she went through Persona 5.

1730
02:22:39,550 --> 02:22:43,994
[SPEAKER_05]: She created her own voices for all the characters in the game.

1731
02:22:45,390 --> 02:23:01,656
[SPEAKER_05]: he fell deep into the lore and just got emotional and attached to it so there'll be parts of that stream where you will be watching but there'll be parts of the stream where you'll be doing other things as background noise as she's doing the voices for all of the the text stuff which is kind of cool yeah

1732
02:23:03,257 --> 02:23:06,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw is recommending a Twitch channel called Classic Tetris.

1733
02:23:06,059 --> 02:23:07,299
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fun.

1734
02:23:07,299 --> 02:23:10,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster points out part of the challenge is finding streamers that fit your time slot.

1735
02:23:10,962 --> 02:23:16,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Some really good streamers cast at very odd hours because of their locale, making them hard to see depending on when you search.

1736
02:23:16,706 --> 02:23:17,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1737
02:23:17,366 --> 02:23:21,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also really encourage you to narrow down your search a little bit.

1738
02:23:21,369 --> 02:23:22,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Use keywords.

1739
02:23:23,248 --> 02:23:28,650
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are certain types of streams you're looking for, use keywords, because I do this a lot.

1740
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:33,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm interested in supporting other LGBTQIA plus streamers, so I look for those tags a lot.

1741
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:38,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not exclusive on that, but I usually find, yeah, I'm going to connect with a streamer.

1742
02:23:38,092 --> 02:23:42,053
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have something right away in common if they have that.

1743
02:23:42,053 --> 02:23:50,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also like people that will put chill stream, relaxed stream, or even if I'm in that particular mood and maybe you want it as background noise,

1744
02:23:52,196 --> 02:23:56,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Asmr, which isn't always literally somebody doing ASMR.

1745
02:23:56,377 --> 02:24:00,558
[SPEAKER_06]: But it might be somebody that's playing a game just a little more chill tonight.

1746
02:24:00,558 --> 02:24:02,459
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, tonight we're just gonna vibe out.

1747
02:24:02,459 --> 02:24:04,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna play a little bit of No Man's Sky.

1748
02:24:04,879 --> 02:24:09,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just had an edible and we're gonna take on the latest expedition going on in this game.

1749
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:14,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't y'all just join me in chat and you know, we'll play along.

1750
02:24:14,102 --> 02:24:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sometimes what those are.

1751
02:24:17,302 --> 02:24:19,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I have a request.

1752
02:24:19,363 --> 02:24:19,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what?

1753
02:24:20,728 --> 02:24:25,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you say, the last Metroid is in captivity, the galaxy is at peace?

1754
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1755
02:24:27,431 --> 02:24:29,833
[SPEAKER_04]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

1756
02:24:29,833 --> 02:24:34,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The galaxy is at peace.

1757
02:24:34,735 --> 02:24:36,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that do something for you, Ranma?

1758
02:24:36,216 --> 02:24:37,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?

1759
02:24:37,556 --> 02:24:46,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, when I heard you doing the ASMR voice, my mind switched to that line from Super Metroid, because it reminded me so much of it.

1760
02:24:46,581 --> 02:24:48,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So I needed to hear that!

1761
02:24:50,322 --> 02:24:51,482
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1762
02:25:06,308 --> 02:25:08,489
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkStarSakura says, I still want Rob to voice Nia for my DbD project.

1763
02:25:37,373 --> 02:25:50,287
[SPEAKER_06]: The algorithm on Twitch will learn what you watch and recommend streams to you and it's worth paying attention to sometimes.

1764
02:25:56,654 --> 02:26:01,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hope that's given you some ideas as far as like other names.

1765
02:26:01,122 --> 02:26:04,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course, I would recommend Anime Jam Session.

1766
02:26:04,007 --> 02:26:07,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think, Ranma, you stream really on your personal stream, right?

1767
02:26:08,064 --> 02:26:11,447
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't actually, personally, I don't use it for streaming at all.

1768
02:26:11,447 --> 02:26:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything I do is through Anime Jam Session, and I just keep forgetting to find a time where I just want to do like a chill anime game stream, you know, classic Super Famicom game, just playing through and just having a good time.

1769
02:26:22,856 --> 02:26:26,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I just gotta actually find, like, a time where I can actually do it, so...

1770
02:26:27,288 --> 02:26:30,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just looking at my list of who's streaming right now.

1771
02:26:30,990 --> 02:26:32,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Hazlands is a delight.

1772
02:26:32,971 --> 02:26:33,872
[SPEAKER_06]: He's playing Dead by Daylight.

1773
02:26:33,872 --> 02:26:36,753
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a big DVD streamer, but he's really nice.

1774
02:26:36,753 --> 02:26:38,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Leesh Kapish, she's a lot of fun.

1775
02:26:38,274 --> 02:26:39,755
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got a huge community.

1776
02:26:39,755 --> 02:26:41,916
[SPEAKER_06]: She's playing that Power World game right now.

1777
02:26:41,916 --> 02:26:47,639
[SPEAKER_06]: LapinOnline is just... A lot of people I follow, I met at TwitchCon.

1778
02:26:48,999 --> 02:26:50,820
[SPEAKER_06]: NickNPrince, Dead by Daylight Streamer

1779
02:27:07,304 --> 02:27:15,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls Gone Wild went over to Warcraft, I can't, I'm sorry, I forget the name of the Twitch channel, I'm sorry, but I think it's Warcraft Radio, so they do stuff with that.

1780
02:27:15,826 --> 02:27:19,107
[SPEAKER_06]: They have their own Twitch as well, actually.

1781
02:27:19,107 --> 02:27:27,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls Gone Wild has a Twitch, and of course I'm still gonna support them, even if they've gone a different direction, I totally understand why, and I think it's, they're still going!

1782
02:27:27,448 --> 02:27:28,689
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great!

1783
02:27:28,689 --> 02:27:32,510
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been going as long as Anime Jam Session has about, I think.

1784
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:33,830
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been going a long time.

1785
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:34,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

1786
02:27:34,790 --> 02:27:38,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, just giving you some ideas, some things to consider.

1787
02:27:38,171 --> 02:27:55,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, yeah, SSG100 Matt says a lot of people I follow are friends of friends, pay attention to the shout outs, pay attention to the people that in chat are bringing good vibes and are really funny or bring something to the table or like somebody whose comments are on point.

1788
02:27:55,117 --> 02:28:02,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And oftentimes, if you click on their name and see a custom avatar, or you can just go to their page and see if they have followers, it'll tell you if they stream or not.

1789
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:06,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if they only have one follower, they probably don't stream.

1790
02:28:06,103 --> 02:28:10,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a dangerous assumption to make because some people are just really trying to make it.

1791
02:28:10,586 --> 02:28:16,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But usually somebody's, you know, gotten at least like 10, 12 people if they've done a couple streams.

1792
02:28:16,692 --> 02:28:18,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you can kind of tell that way.

1793
02:28:18,473 --> 02:28:21,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, just some ideas.

1794
02:28:21,516 --> 02:28:22,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we gave you something to think about.

1795
02:28:22,657 --> 02:28:25,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, keywords, they go a long way.

1796
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:26,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps.

1797
02:28:27,441 --> 02:28:28,602
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1798
02:28:28,602 --> 02:28:30,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was it for the email.

1799
02:28:30,924 --> 02:28:32,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't see any calls.

1800
02:28:32,586 --> 02:28:33,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all right.

1801
02:28:33,707 --> 02:28:36,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see.

1802
02:28:36,269 --> 02:28:40,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Quest Buster in chat says on voice stuff, check out the modding community.

1803
02:28:40,493 --> 02:28:45,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Fallout 4 is finally getting a massive mod release this year and it has a ton of voice acted roles.

1804
02:28:45,558 --> 02:28:47,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Projects are always looking for roles.

1805
02:28:47,881 --> 02:28:49,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is.

1806
02:28:49,442 --> 02:28:51,744
[SPEAKER_06]: That is another yeah, fan mods and things like that.

1807
02:28:51,744 --> 02:28:52,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1808
02:28:53,522 --> 02:29:04,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember years ago, like, I think when Final Fantasy IV The After Years came out, there was a project behind that to do, um, like, like a, like a radio play for that.

1809
02:29:04,487 --> 02:29:07,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So I knew a couple of people that were connected to that.

1810
02:29:07,388 --> 02:29:08,809
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1811
02:29:08,809 --> 02:29:11,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that brings us towards the end of the show.

1812
02:29:11,170 --> 02:29:12,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, please.

1813
02:29:12,011 --> 02:29:12,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

1814
02:29:12,831 --> 02:29:21,395
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing, I'm surprised this wasn't on, on the show roll, but I want to bring this up about Ubisoft, uh, screwing the pooch.

1815
02:29:22,438 --> 02:29:25,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, talk about this a little bit.

1816
02:29:25,239 --> 02:29:38,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, basically, what's been happening is, I think the CEO basically said in an interview or something like that, telling fans to get used to not owning your video games.

1817
02:29:38,342 --> 02:29:40,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, this has been a meme all week.

1818
02:29:42,328 --> 02:29:50,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And the funny thing is, I have been seeing people get upset about this and be like, I hold a physical copy of the game, I don't know what you're talking about.

1819
02:29:50,413 --> 02:30:00,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have said, um, my brother in Christ, my sister in Christ, for the last 10 to 15 years, you do not own the video games that you purchased.

1820
02:30:00,038 --> 02:30:03,020
[SPEAKER_05]: You own a license to play that game.

1821
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:06,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And the publishers can revoke that at any time as they wish.

1822
02:30:07,222 --> 02:30:09,403
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a physical copy of the game.

1823
02:30:09,403 --> 02:30:12,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Physical copy of the game, so it has to call home to make sure you can play it.

1824
02:30:12,485 --> 02:30:14,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't want you to play it.

1825
02:30:14,026 --> 02:30:17,269
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do that.

1826
02:30:17,269 --> 02:30:18,629
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you know this is true?

1827
02:30:18,629 --> 02:30:21,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you need to read the end user license agreement.

1828
02:30:21,471 --> 02:30:22,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I never agreed to that.

1829
02:30:22,872 --> 02:30:23,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you did.

1830
02:30:23,673 --> 02:30:28,476
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to check that you agree to it in order to install the game on your PC.

1831
02:30:28,476 --> 02:30:28,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

1832
02:30:33,312 --> 02:30:39,075
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the same meme that I saw the first time, but this was something that definitely had me thinking.

1833
02:30:39,075 --> 02:30:43,116
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the same, but it still gets the same point across.

1834
02:30:43,116 --> 02:30:50,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And the meme goes like this, if paying for games means you don't own them, then pirating games isn't stealing.

1835
02:30:50,779 --> 02:30:51,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Food for thought.

1836
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:54,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a discussion about that.

1837
02:30:54,381 --> 02:30:57,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I have gone on record regarding that.

1838
02:30:57,769 --> 02:31:01,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I admit at one time I have pirated games and movies.

1839
02:31:01,531 --> 02:31:15,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I bootlegged this all of that when it comes to fansubs There's like a general rule of when the series is licensed you drop it and you go to something else It was considered a gray market, but the licensors were like no still bootleg.

1840
02:31:15,338 --> 02:31:24,883
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do it, and that's what was happening I mean when Fullmetal Alchemist was being released here multiple fansubbing groups passed it like a hot potato, but now

1841
02:31:26,010 --> 02:31:31,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically where you have a license to play this game or watch this content.

1842
02:31:31,672 --> 02:31:32,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

1843
02:31:32,313 --> 02:31:34,994
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way it's been for the last 10, 15 years.

1844
02:31:34,994 --> 02:31:36,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the license agreement.

1845
02:31:36,434 --> 02:31:43,597
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't say you didn't agree to it because you had to in order to access what you wanted.

1846
02:31:43,597 --> 02:31:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where it's going.

1847
02:31:45,858 --> 02:31:46,659
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the future.

1848
02:31:46,659 --> 02:31:47,579
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how it's going to be.

1849
02:31:49,262 --> 02:31:50,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see what's going to happen.

1850
02:31:50,923 --> 02:31:54,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, look at some of the MMOs that are no longer around.

1851
02:31:54,546 --> 02:31:56,488
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a prime example.

1852
02:31:56,488 --> 02:32:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't play that MMO anymore because the servers are gone and your physical copy is just sitting on your shelf collecting dust.

1853
02:32:04,767 --> 02:32:25,124
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, I do agree with you, but it is interesting what fans will do because just last week we had that story on City of Heroes, uh, which, you know, faded years ago is somewhat making a comeback through a fan community that essentially it's, it's embraced by the original developers, you know, and that sort of thing is that City of Heroes is essentially going to live on in that way.

1854
02:32:25,124 --> 02:32:29,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is, it is interesting what fans will do to save games like that.

1855
02:32:30,541 --> 02:32:35,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think you've brought up a couple times there are private WoW servers for similar issues.

1856
02:32:35,527 --> 02:32:37,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but Blizzard don't like those.

1857
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:40,394
[SPEAKER_06]: But because of those, we have WoW Classic.

1858
02:32:40,394 --> 02:32:44,679
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something to consider, is that Blizzard kind of responded to it in their own way.

1859
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1860
02:33:05,523 --> 02:33:08,285
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, no, I mean like, and you know, I also, I want to be clear.

1861
02:33:08,285 --> 02:33:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't advocate for piracy either.

1862
02:33:10,546 --> 02:33:19,232
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was a time in my life, and even you can go back on this show where I was, because I would get so frustrated at games that did not release in the U.S.

1863
02:33:19,232 --> 02:33:25,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, if they're not going to release the game here for me to purchase it, then I'm going to download it and just take it because they don't want me to buy it.

1864
02:33:25,076 --> 02:33:26,097
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that says.

1865
02:33:26,097 --> 02:33:34,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize, you know, especially I'm older and more mature now, I realize there's complicated licensing agreements that they can't sometimes release music games and other reasons for that reason.

1866
02:33:34,142 --> 02:33:35,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I'm,

1867
02:33:36,745 --> 02:33:37,326
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

1868
02:33:37,326 --> 02:33:38,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still very stubborn in that way.

1869
02:33:38,948 --> 02:33:45,298
[SPEAKER_06]: But this whole concept of there's games that are only released in certain territories, a lot of that's faded.

1870
02:33:45,298 --> 02:33:50,045
[SPEAKER_06]: It's over the years as you know, digital has made it more of a global marketplace for sure.

1871
02:33:51,221 --> 02:34:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're right and i'll go on record and say at the time i pirated bootleg because i wanted it and i couldn't afford it half the time if i played it i'm like you know what i'm going to buy this and i'm going to support it and with the advent of streaming anime being able to watch some of my series i started hitting the delete button on titles i

1872
02:34:10,942 --> 02:34:12,002
[SPEAKER_05]: that I downloaded.

1873
02:34:12,002 --> 02:34:15,443
[SPEAKER_05]: When I started buying stuff, I was able to do that as well.

1874
02:34:15,443 --> 02:34:24,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, as I continued to go to conventions and meet voice actors and people in the industry, the views on piracy just changed.

1875
02:34:24,746 --> 02:34:38,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And my thing is this, I don't condone it, but if you're going to pirate it because the source material is completely unavailable, I can understand that.

1876
02:34:39,529 --> 02:34:48,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see myself dropping like maybe $500 on an out-of-print series, but I can go to a site and pull it and it's fine.

1877
02:34:48,677 --> 02:34:58,224
[SPEAKER_05]: If that series gets re-licensed for sale and it's $50 for it, I will buy it for $50 and hit the delete button on my downloads.

1878
02:34:58,224 --> 02:34:58,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Simple as that.

1879
02:35:00,669 --> 02:35:04,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see what develops of this whole stance.

1880
02:35:04,771 --> 02:35:06,512
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, here's in here it is.

1881
02:35:06,512 --> 02:35:08,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And this loops back to the beginning of the show.

1882
02:35:08,793 --> 02:35:11,234
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you know, pal world and all that stuff.

1883
02:35:11,234 --> 02:35:14,715
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to support something, support it.

1884
02:35:14,715 --> 02:35:18,557
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't want to support something, don't support it and support something else.

1885
02:35:18,557 --> 02:35:19,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

1886
02:35:19,097 --> 02:35:20,238
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1887
02:35:20,238 --> 02:35:24,840
[SPEAKER_06]: The games that sell and the games that you know, that's, that's the stuff they're going to make more of.

1888
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:29,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as Ubisoft's next project goes, if they try to release something that you don't actually own, don't buy it.

1889
02:35:30,501 --> 02:35:31,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1890
02:35:31,942 --> 02:35:33,202
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1891
02:35:33,202 --> 02:35:36,644
[SPEAKER_06]: But with your wallet, that's the way we always used to phrase it.

1892
02:35:36,644 --> 02:35:37,384
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1893
02:35:37,384 --> 02:35:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, thank you for bringing that up.

1894
02:35:38,844 --> 02:35:42,746
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a, see, all the pow world discourse completely derailed.

1895
02:35:42,746 --> 02:35:46,728

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1909
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:52,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look at it this way.

1910
02:36:52,901 --> 02:37:00,366
[SPEAKER_05]: At least this time, I'm not in behind you sitting behind you doing caramel dancing.

1911
02:37:00,366 --> 02:37:03,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to always be thankful for that.

1912
02:37:03,068 --> 02:37:03,648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

1913
02:37:05,831 --> 02:37:17,309
[SPEAKER_06]: you know I always you know that fucking Carameldansen is still a meme I see it on TikToks and what I'll see is I'll see like this how I spent my weekend and it's a guy passed the fuck out on the floor as the neon lights are going off in the room and you hear

1914
02:37:19,935 --> 02:37:23,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like, and then the cats are just walking over him.

1915
02:37:23,256 --> 02:37:24,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so funny to me.

1916
02:37:24,436 --> 02:37:25,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

1917
02:37:25,497 --> 02:37:30,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're saying is you were watching video footage from MAGFest this weekend.

1918
02:37:30,438 --> 02:37:31,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that what they were doing at MAGFest?

1919
02:37:31,979 --> 02:37:33,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that in chat.

1920
02:37:33,219 --> 02:37:35,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to say welcome back from MAGFest.

1921
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:41,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looked like I heard you say there's a lot of people at MAGFest, but I'm not terribly surprised.

1922
02:37:41,681 --> 02:37:46,883
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of the I mean, I know 2023 was kind of the first year back, but this this really feels like

1923
02:37:47,563 --> 02:37:50,946
[SPEAKER_06]: really, really back, you know, this year, it was like me hosting a show last night.

1924
02:37:50,946 --> 02:37:53,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if y'all know, but I host live shows in town.

1925
02:37:53,188 --> 02:37:54,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I love doing it.

1926
02:37:54,189 --> 02:37:58,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had our first show of the year last night, the Sacramento Horror Film Festival was last night.

1927
02:37:58,972 --> 02:38:02,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And the burlesque troupe I work with a lot was doing like a mini show.

1928
02:38:02,075 --> 02:38:03,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was hosting for them.

1929
02:38:03,416 --> 02:38:09,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the first show I've done since October because you know, we just don't do a lot in that space over the holidays.

1930
02:38:09,781 --> 02:38:12,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just felt really fucking nice to be back.

1931
02:38:12,864 --> 02:38:15,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And just like it was a really good crowd.

1932
02:38:15,146 --> 02:38:16,087
[SPEAKER_06]: People were into it.

1933
02:38:16,087 --> 02:38:16,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just

1934
02:38:18,396 --> 02:38:20,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Live performance feels really good.

1935
02:38:20,377 --> 02:38:21,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Being in the same space feels good.

1936
02:38:21,937 --> 02:38:24,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we still need to be aware and cautious.

1937
02:38:24,198 --> 02:38:27,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I don't want to make believe COVID doesn't exist.

1938
02:38:27,139 --> 02:38:30,920
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have vaccines, we have precautions, we have ways.

1939
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really nice to hear people getting together connecting again, whether it's Games Done Quick, whether it's

1940
02:38:37,506 --> 02:38:43,652
[SPEAKER_06]: MagFest, whether it's your local anime convention, whether it's just getting together at the house with friends.

1941
02:38:43,652 --> 02:38:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's just nice.

1942
02:38:47,776 --> 02:38:50,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I've missed you, bitches.

1943
02:38:50,098 --> 02:38:51,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And we missed you, too.

1944
02:38:51,219 --> 02:38:52,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.

1945
02:38:52,641 --> 02:38:53,422
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1946
02:38:53,422 --> 02:38:55,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rama, you know, you've been listening to the show long enough.

1947
02:38:55,924 --> 02:38:59,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is the part of the show where I'm going to let you have a final thought.

1948
02:38:59,347 --> 02:39:01,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So Rama, your final thought.

1949
02:39:03,078 --> 02:39:09,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I have five bags of KitKats in my fridge and they're kinda calling me.

1950
02:39:09,932 --> 02:39:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm jealous.

1951
02:39:11,014 --> 02:39:12,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Those flavored KitKats are fun.

1952
02:39:12,517 --> 02:39:14,541
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the best flavored KitKat you came across?

1953
02:39:16,425 --> 02:39:17,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemon.

1954
02:39:17,165 --> 02:39:18,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so good.

1955
02:39:18,226 --> 02:39:20,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually had that and it is really good.

1956
02:39:20,026 --> 02:39:25,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I have to, you know, obviously I have to watch my candy intake, but it's hard to turn down a little KitKat bar.

1957
02:39:25,488 --> 02:39:26,888
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

1958
02:39:26,888 --> 02:39:29,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, my final thought, gosh, I don't know.

1959
02:39:29,989 --> 02:39:32,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I, yeah, I think I just kind of said it there.

1960
02:39:32,950 --> 02:39:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels it feels really good to be doing stuff live again.

1961
02:39:35,531 --> 02:39:37,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to conventions coming up again.

1962
02:39:37,712 --> 02:39:41,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to my cruise, not gonna lie, because it's basically a floating convention.

1963
02:39:41,753 --> 02:39:42,574
[SPEAKER_06]: at the end of February.

1964
02:39:42,574 --> 02:39:43,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited about that.

1965
02:39:43,736 --> 02:39:46,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, DragonCon's on my agenda for this year.

1966
02:39:46,439 --> 02:39:54,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting for the confirmation that I'll be, you know, I don't foresee that being an issue, but I never, I never consider anything done until it's done.

1967
02:39:54,850 --> 02:39:56,211
[SPEAKER_06]: But, and then who knows?

1968
02:39:56,211 --> 02:39:57,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows what else this year?

1969
02:39:57,273 --> 02:39:57,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything's possible.

1970
02:39:57,933 --> 02:39:58,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a fun year.
