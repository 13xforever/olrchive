1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday I was telling some friends about Mother 3, and today I'm learning about a Japanese-only F-Zero release I either didn't know about or had forgotten about.

2
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any memory of F-Zero's non-console nor arcade releases, so it's probably the former.

3
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:23,124
[SPEAKER_04]: The import titles we get via Nintendo Switch Online have been an interesting drip feed.

4
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother 3 may never reach the West officially, but to experience two F-Zero games I've never previously had is a boon.

5
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Import hipsters, radio condescending sneers.

6
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:34,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

8
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:41,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,524 --> 00:01:01,917
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again on our world record long run here with episode number 1019 for tonight on October the 6th of 2024.

11
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:08,002
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as they do every week, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, how are you?

13
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:16,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Swollen.

14
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:19,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That does not sound fun.

15
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:22,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is not.

16
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:34,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say that, well, stuff can continue to ferment when you start making sangria, and opening a sealed bottle after two months can be explosive.

17
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:35,988
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds so scary.

18
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:39,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to hear that that happened, but I hope you're feeling better.

19
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, enough drugs will make anyone feel better.

20
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me give you something to look forward to.

21
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:49,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I correctly see on your husband's Facebook, I think that's where I saw it, that Pentagogo's next weekend?

22
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:50,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

23
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:53,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't go to Pentagogo anymore.

24
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:53,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you don't?

25
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it bad or something?

26
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,891
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's because Cornfield.

27
00:01:59,471 --> 00:01:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

28
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:08,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the allergic reaction that I'm having from last night's event, and I will elaborate later on my own time,

29
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need any more allergic reactions to anything.

30
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:13,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair.

31
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:16,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I must admit, I'm kind of tempted because I don't think I've ever been to that show.

32
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:22,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm always doing something in October when they have it, but I'm actually kind of free next weekend, so I might go check that out.

33
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:25,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the facility is air-conditioned.

34
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:25,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

35
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're finally going to break this.

36
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:32,223
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 100 degrees here in Sacramento, California, where we're all based.

37
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:36,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's early October, and it's still 100 freaking degrees.

38
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that streak finally breaks next weekend.

39
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:42,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be a much more sensible 74 degrees.

40
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,787
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think it's like low 80s, but still, I'll take it versus this.

41
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:51,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, and I'll just say this, I don't know what Dan posts on Facebook because I don't go on Facebook.

42
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right, right, right.

43
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm pretty sure that's where I saw it.

44
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:58,052
[SPEAKER_07]: But, well, speaking of pinball... I'll ask him.

45
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:05,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I did think of you because I was in Old Town, Sak, and there's a new pinball place down there.

46
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:06,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's weird.

47
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:35,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

48
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:36,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

49
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:09,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's say hello as well, of course, as we do every week to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

50
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:10,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

51
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:11,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Loki.

52
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:11,829
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

53
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:12,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine.

54
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good, good.

55
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,573
[SPEAKER_07]: What game is that running behind you tonight?

56
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:18,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see what it is.

57
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:21,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's it look like?

58
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:22,756
[SPEAKER_06]: There's meat.

59
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Attack the enemy by swinging the whip controller.

60
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's some type of Castlevania.

61
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the Castlevania arcade game?

62
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:28,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Castlevania the arcade game.

63
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:30,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it!

64
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it!

65
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:32,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I won!

66
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:32,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I win!

67
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:33,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fun.

68
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,217
[SPEAKER_07]: What made you decide to pick that?

69
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:36,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

70
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to pick games I've never picked before.

71
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, ah... I sat here for like five minutes going, I don't know.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, ah, October.

73
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's think of like spooky game.

74
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Castlevania.

75
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:50,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that was something I saw that I was like, oh, I don't recognize that.

76
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:54,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like, I actually wonder like, is there an arcade game other than Haunted Mansion?

77
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:56,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And yep, there was.

78
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:01,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was like, I feel like I've seen Castlevania references everywhere this last week.

79
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:07,099
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, of course, you know, Dracula and half the Belmonts are in Dead by Daylight now.

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But no Richter.

81
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:15,004
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no Richter yet, but aren't there like five alt skins now for Trevor?

82
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:19,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're doing... Who was the last Belmont from that last game?

83
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:21,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not Belmont, but...

84
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:24,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess he's a Belmont technically.

85
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:30,125
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's all the alt characters.

86
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:34,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is funny because Silent Hill has a bunch of alt characters too.

87
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:35,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheryl has a ton of alts.

88
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:42,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, of course, Silent Hill 2, I'm sure some of you are aware, just early access released last night.

89
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So the new remake of Silent Hill, as well as Until Dawn.

90
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's definitely October because all the scary stuff's coming out.

91
00:05:50,493 --> 00:06:17,891
[SPEAKER_07]: um just both released apparently uh feedback for both of those is pretty good uh I watched I've been hearing some different stuff about the Until Dawn one like the ray tracing is broken I I did hear at the beginning so something that a friend of mine was telling me about is that at the beginning it looked like it was like AI and it was a big like red flag like oh no was this an AI done job or something but I guess it gets better as the game goes on and I was watching one of my buddies stream the ending last night

92
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:24,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't... It didn't look as good as I would have expected it to look.

93
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that, for what it's worth.

94
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:30,382
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess if I'd never played the series before, maybe I'd be really into it.

95
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,083
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Silent Hill 2 looks great.

96
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:36,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently they've made some subtle... Shane was, of course, texting me all day about it.

97
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:38,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And... Not really, once or twice.

98
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's been telling me that there's been some subtle changes.

99
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously I don't want to go too much into that.

100
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,916
[SPEAKER_07]: But that they've definitely gone back and re-evaluated...

101
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:53,922
[SPEAKER_07]: What Makes Sense in 2024, or maybe even What Is It We Want to Do Different in 2024 versus the original Silent Hill.

102
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:55,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's very interesting, quite frankly.

103
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:07,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, going to our chat, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

104
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:09,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

105
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:14,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkTetsuya, referencing the intro tonight, says, I did buy the Guinness Book Gamers Edition 2025.

106
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

107
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure the Guinness people are happy to have your money.

108
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:27,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I had an IRL friend buy it once they heard my, because I had posted on Facebook about it in the little picture that Matt had early on before I had my copy.

109
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:31,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of my IRL friends saw the book on the shelf somewhere and just picked it up.

110
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:32,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Was like, oh, my friend Romson does.

111
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:33,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to buy this.

112
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:34,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was really cool.

113
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:35,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, that's really sweet.

114
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:47,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys know more people that have bought it, but I feel like maybe we should have had, if we were smarter, we would have had an Amazon affiliate link or something to get a little kickback.

116
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

117
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:49,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

118
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:50,965
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

119
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy we're in it.

120
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:53,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great.

121
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,127
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about that all a couple weeks ago.

122
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:57,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still waiting to hear back, though.

123
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:01,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because you're still trying to get the official, official certificate, right?

124
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:06,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I wonder, have you ever emailed the contact?

125
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:08,175
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

126
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:12,958
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was supposed to, and I was out doing stuff, and you know me, out of sight, out of mind.

127
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So remind me after tonight's show, and I'll send a quick email.

128
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:20,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It does seem like that maybe this side of the house doesn't talk to that side of the house.

129
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like there's a little bit of that going on.

130
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:28,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they'll be like, oh, you're in the book, but you didn't pay, so we're not going to give you certificate.

131
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,410
[SPEAKER_07]: They might contract out some of these sub-editions.

132
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,711
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thought.

133
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:33,643
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll figure out.

134
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to the bottom of this.

135
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:35,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we will.

136
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:35,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

137
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:43,929
[SPEAKER_07]: OG Happy Dude in chat says, was it 2025 or last year's that has Billy Mitchell's record redacted?

138
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't read the rest of the book, but I don't think they would really advertise a redaction.

139
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:55,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And besides, at least as far as Donkey Kong goes, other people have had that record for a long time, right?

140
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:57,458
[SPEAKER_07]: He hasn't had that anymore for a long time, I think.

141
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, he had some other old school records, so I know it's not just that.

142
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:07,025
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I don't know what Guinness did to him because honestly, when it comes to that guy,

143
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:18,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't care anymore I just don't care anymore I did meet him at DragonCon one year pre-pandemic so it was a while ago and I will say this

144
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,276
[SPEAKER_07]: People have said that, oh, it's all a persona.

145
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,798
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all a show that he puts on and all that, right?

146
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:31,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would say from my experience when I interacted with him at DragonCon, I would find that to be true.

147
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:44,915
[SPEAKER_07]: That I was there with a friend who had another relationship with him and they were having a casual conversation and I was like, okay, that whole bit about he's putting on an act for a lot of people, I believe that that's true, 100%. 100%.

148
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:52,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, PodCulture talking about the book says it's $14.95 on Amazon right now for those interested.

149
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's actually not that expensive, um, all things considered.

150
00:09:55,739 --> 00:10:00,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it feels a little more like a magazine to me, um, but I actually like it.

151
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:04,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's very, um, it's very loud, like in a good way, so.

152
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:10,305
[SPEAKER_07]: OG Happy Dude also says, speed running records are more impressive than high score records anyway.

153
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:13,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wanting to hear about the Jotz and Mitchell lawsuit.

154
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:16,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

155
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:23,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I think high scores are neat, but I really love when they find ways to break games.

156
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the 256 board bug in Pac-Man?

157
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:27,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Fascinating.

158
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:32,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And all that stuff, like the way they kind of like find those hidden exploits and all these old and old games.

159
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But speedrunning also brings a lot of that up.

160
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,901
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you watch any speedrun and as long as it's, you know...

161
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:42,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Not 100%, no, what do they call that?

162
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,606
[SPEAKER_07]: No hacking or no cheating or whatever.

163
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:50,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you will see a bunch of exploits that they do to get the speedruns done.

164
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And that stuff is very, very fascinating to me.

165
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, points are good.

166
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Achievements are good.

167
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:58,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever had pizza?

168
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But have you ever had pizza while getting achievements?

169
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,683
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an achievement within itself.

170
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:06,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Pepperoni unlocked.

171
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:07,104
What?

172
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

173
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:13,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is one of the biggest, like...

174
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:22,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, sorts of stories, but we should talk about this a little bit anyway because I think this leads to a bigger problem in the games industry right now.

175
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:30,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, would you mind starting us off with tonight's story, which, by the way, was posted in our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

176
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:42,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you to join our Discord server and talk with us throughout the week because sometimes y'all post stories, and I don't know if Loki stole it from Discord, but he found the exact same story, and we like to talk about him on air because y'all find some neat stuff.

177
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,484
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, what's...

178
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:44,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are we starting tonight?

179
00:11:45,604 --> 00:12:04,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Game Industry Biz reported on a survey done by Media Research that was basically pulling different gamers from around the world and asking them what type of gaming do you like doing?

180
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it, you know,

181
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,731
[SPEAKER_06]: PvE, PvP, Couch Co-op, Single Player, that type of stuff.

182
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:22,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And they broke it up across all the different age brackets and come to find out 53% of gamers actually prefer to play games offline or a single player game.

183
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:24,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Gasp, no.

184
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:26,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's so crazy.

185
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:29,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It does also trend upwards as you get older.

186
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because, you know, as a lot of folks are

187
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:45,179
[SPEAKER_06]: In the 9-5, you know, day-to-day, it's hard to stay competitive in online games when a lot of, like, younger people have a lot more free time to do that stuff.

188
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it can kind of dissuade you from wanting to do that type of thing.

189
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:56,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and a lot of us over the age of 30 and 40 don't like to log on to voice chat just to be called a slur, something misogynistic.

190
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:59,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think a lot of us are just kind of over that.

191
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:00,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

192
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:04,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when it's like a 14-year-old that's saying it.

193
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:10,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I flashback all the way to episode one of Orange Lounge Radio.

194
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:18,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio episode one, when DarkSakura was ranting about a mother who was changing her baby's diaper on a keyboard mania machine.

195
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

196
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is your mother?

197
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:24,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I will find her and I will talk to her.

198
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:31,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 74% of folks over the age of 55 prefer single-player gaming.

199
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:35,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, 58% of mobile gamers prefer single-player titles as well.

200
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:37,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is very interesting.

201
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:39,293
[SPEAKER_07]: That is very interesting.

202
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:43,396
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, you know, there's a reason things like, like, I would say Candy Crush is single-player.

203
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably, like, more casual.

204
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:53,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you're just, like, you don't want the hassle or you don't have the internet infrastructure or you don't want to play a competitive game on a device that has no controller.

205
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:53,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's

206
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:57,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see a lot of reasons why you wouldn't want to do that.

207
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, where would something like, let's say, Pokemon Go or Monster Hunter now?

208
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:02,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you all know I'm obsessed with AR games.

209
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:03,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I've talked about it a bunch.

210
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:12,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Would a game like Pokemon Go, I mean, technically it's multiplayer, but I think for most people that's a very single-player experience until I'm ready to raid.

211
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's a very incidental thing.

212
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:19,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's more like a single-player game with some online co-op

213
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:38,865
[SPEAKER_06]: or PVP elements to it so it's even though it is an online game you're playing most of the game single player until you do like a raid or you fight you know you battle somebody or something like that but otherwise it's pretty much just a solo game yeah

214
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:49,658
[SPEAKER_07]: or even like Pikmin, which, you know, again, another one I love is a very solo game, but like it's solo, but like you get to share stats with friends in meaningful ways.

215
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's, that's about how multiplayer that game gets.

216
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:52,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's.

217
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

218
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,681
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's good.

219
00:14:54,781 --> 00:15:00,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, like if the question is, well, well, gamers prefer single player.

220
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Why, why are they pushing for multiplayer money?

221
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:04,606
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always money.

222
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:09,268
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they make so much money on online game, live service games.

223
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,526
[SPEAKER_06]: that are successful, because there's a lot that aren't.

224
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:13,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite the gamble.

225
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:21,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you do have a successful online live service game, then you rake in tons of money.

226
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:23,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at Grand Theft Auto Online.

227
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:25,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at, you know, Fortnite.

228
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Overwatch.

229
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of perfect examples of making lots of money.

230
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Conquered.

231
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Babylon's Fall.

232
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at, you know, the problem...

233
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Foam Stars having to make a big change.

234
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:41,968
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about this later.

235
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,869
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only so much space in that box.

236
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:51,670
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a finite number of players and a finite number of time that those players can play those games.

237
00:15:51,910 --> 00:16:01,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, if you're not putting out a compelling game or an argument to play your game, then people won't play your game and you'll get shut down really fast.

238
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:04,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And also why companies are scared as hell to make new IPs.

239
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:12,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, new IPs in the live service area, yeah, they should be scared.

240
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:24,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's just, it's very, you're relying on... Unless you're pulling in Disney, Speedstorm, Marvel, the Overwatch thingy, whatever it's called, I can't even remember now.

241
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're pulling in something else that's recognizable, right?

242
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Fortnite, pulling in literally everything.

243
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I mean...

244
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:34,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

245
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really like those types of games.

246
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:43,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, if there was something that was really interesting, maybe I would play that.

247
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:51,962
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of the stuff that comes out, especially when you start talking about all the monetization and stuff with it, it just really doesn't sound good.

248
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:58,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when you're having companies essentially try to adopt the mobile free-to-play model with a game that costs $80.

249
00:16:59,024 --> 00:16:59,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

250
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:29,478
[SPEAKER_06]: no you can't have it both ways I mean sure you could try but like it's it just screams very just greed driven and I'm sorry like if the argument is well our game is too expensive to make and we need to do all this to be sustainable then go back to the drawing board and think of something smaller like do something less crazy I mean go look at Among Us look at like you know um

251
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Fall Guys, you know, stuff like that.

252
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:35,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, those games didn't cost millions and millions of dollars to make.

253
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,684
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of these things too, they're like spending a ton of money in game promotion.

254
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:45,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's almost unnecessary if you have a pretty solid title.

255
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:47,888
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

256
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:34,284
[SPEAKER_07]: OG Happy Dude is bringing up Fortnite in chat kind of talking about the other way around remember it was supposed to be a single player game and Battle Royale was going to be like an extra thing and then Battle Royale just took the fuck over and OG Happy Dude in chat is asking where the hell is the single player co-op save the world experience that we were supposed to get in Fortnite I believe it's I believe it came out some time ago but it's like it's very de-emphasized like it's there in the shop you can buy it for like 10 bucks or however much but they very de-emphasized

257
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, not something that's like front and center.

258
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:46,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but I'm pretty sure it's there, but you know, now Fortnite, you know, again, Fortnite is now a platform and we've talked about this several months ago on the show.

259
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:53,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite is no longer a game battle Royale or Fortnite colon battle Royale is the game.

260
00:18:55,114 --> 00:19:01,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite is now a platform because Fortnite also has Lego Fortnite, Rock Band 5.

261
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:04,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, excuse me, Lego Festival or whatever the hell they call that.

262
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:05,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite Festival, that's it.

263
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:07,667
[SPEAKER_07]: The racing game.

264
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:09,269
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's going to be more things like that.

265
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite is now a multi...

266
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:30,249
[SPEAKER_07]: console platform of its own it's a virtual platform of its own and that's exactly where Fortnite I think wanted to be this whole time and it's it's that is really a thing of its own that's that and there's really not space for a lot of other things like it I think to be honest so

267
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OG Happy Dude says, that's dumb.

268
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,823
[SPEAKER_07]: A free online, very toxic player base only to pay for the single player co-op experience?

269
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:40,543
[SPEAKER_07]: F that.

270
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:42,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

271
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The multiplayer experience really isn't free either.

272
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure.

273
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:51,992
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play a lot for free and you can get through, but they're going to entice you with that battle pass.

274
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you want an Ariana Grande skin?

275
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:56,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I got suckered in the Aria.

276
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you want a Tron skin?

277
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:00,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I maybe got suckered in the Tron skin too.

278
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually, there's going to be something that's going to get you.

279
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:33,610
[SPEAKER_07]: they're gonna get you unless you are very strong-willed or really really casual in your gameplay and that stuff really does not matter to you because of course I could sit here and say it's it's impossible to and someone's always gonna speak up and say I didn't do it of course of course you can you can be very strong-willed and get through that stuff without ever spending a dime but they make it very difficult they make it very very okay gotcha yeah sorry even OG happy dude says in chat the Ryu and Chun-Li skins got me sigh see see

280
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:36,655
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree.

281
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:39,717
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

282
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:41,478
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, you're not alone.

283
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:41,978
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not alone.

284
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:45,740
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something, even DarkSakura, you even bought something in Fortnite, didn't you?

285
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you buy?

286
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

287
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

288
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Ariana Grande skins and I got Emma Frost.

289
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:53,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

290
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:56,625
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's, they get you eventually.

291
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:57,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Goddess.

292
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:57,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You know.

293
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:05,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I got the Master of Puppets emote because it's absolutely hilarious to watch Ariana Grande doing Master of Puppets.

294
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Fortnite Festival with Ariana Grande when you can do like a death metal song with her on vocals.

295
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:11,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun.

296
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:17,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, here's, I guess, maybe like the point and what I wanted to get to with this.

297
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:23,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, there's, it's, I mean, 53% is also not a big majority.

298
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:26,283
[SPEAKER_07]: 53% sounds like a poll in the presidential election right now.

299
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:28,925
[SPEAKER_07]: We know how like disgustingly close this presidential election is.

300
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:31,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Which shouldn't be, but that's another topic.

301
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:35,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, and 53 is still pretty close.

302
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:46,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way the industry operates sometimes, and especially with a lot of these companies you look at that are failing, it really looks like they're putting all of their eggs in one half of the basket.

303
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:48,085
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

304
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:10,788
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

305
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:43,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect 3 for me was like that perfect balance and I know a lot of people hated the multiplayer of Mass Effect 3 so people are going to disagree with me and that's fine but I think Mass Effect 3 was that perfect balance of like there is a full ass fucking rounded single player awesome experience here

306
00:22:44,528 --> 00:23:08,336
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there's a little multiplayer experience you can get in there and teehee with your friends and it really was to be played with your friends because it was a horde mode, PvE type of game that you can go do on the side and I actually found that really rewarding in that experience and that's where I think game design is best when it's really a single player focused game and multiplayer is something that's kind of added there a little bit after the fact

307
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:14,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily a hard and fast rule because, sure, I enjoy Dead by Daylight as well, which has no single-player mode.

308
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,282
[SPEAKER_07]: They are starting to contract with other companies to make single-player experiences, like the casting of Frank Stone.

309
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:21,302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a single-player game.

310
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:23,643
[SPEAKER_07]: But bye-bye, Dark...

311
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer game.

312
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Not every game is going to be that either, even in the horror space.

313
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:38,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I feel like a lot of games that try to be in that same asymmetrical space have kind of...

314
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:58,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Texas Chainsaw Massacre it's still there actually Alan really still loves Texas Chainsaw Massacre and plays it but they don't they're not able to get that same constant support and it's kind of killer clowns I feel like hit really fast and then although I'm shocked that they got the Elvira that's a game I wouldn't mind seeing die well

315
00:23:58,724 --> 00:23:59,826
[SPEAKER_01]: For personal reasons.

316
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but they got the Elvira.

317
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:05,772
[SPEAKER_07]: When you put the clownophobia aside, the Elvira license is huge.

318
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of shocked.

319
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't talk about that last week, I don't think.

320
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,559
[SPEAKER_07]: But they got Elvira licensed, which I was like, what?

321
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,460
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

322
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:16,253
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not to say Elvira can't be in other games.

323
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:18,695
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still not enough to get me over that game.

324
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:19,716
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I understand.

325
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:21,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else?

326
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:28,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously Friday the 13th came before Dead by Daylight, but Friday the 13th I think kind of imploded for a lot of other reasons.

327
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:31,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it had anything to do, because I think that team actually made Killer Clowns.

328
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're still kind of doing their thing.

329
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:34,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else?

330
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another asymmetrical game that was being streamed for a hot minute that came out.

331
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:38,949
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the one

332
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Our buddy Isoco loved to stream it.

333
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:44,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the schoolhouse game.

334
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,032
[SPEAKER_07]: They were in the high school running around.

335
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,213
[SPEAKER_07]: The little puppet, the doll master.

336
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:48,814
[SPEAKER_07]: VHS.

337
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,294
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

338
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: There was that.

339
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:50,915
[SPEAKER_07]: That one came and went.

340
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:54,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Anyways, I just...

341
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:58,706
[SPEAKER_07]: OG HappyDude says, Elvira in Dead by Daylight?

342
00:24:58,906 --> 00:24:59,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish.

343
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:04,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I'd like to see her, but she's actually just getting added to Killer Clowns from Outer Space.

344
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:09,434
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura has said it on the show before.

345
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:13,417
[SPEAKER_07]: She does not care for clowns, which is a very common kind of phobia.

346
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:20,782
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people that probably are not going to ever play that game unless they do something like what they do with the spiders in...

347
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:24,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Grounded, and you can turn them into blobs with eyes.

348
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:30,517
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only way some people are going to be able to play that game is killer blobs or whatever.

349
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,383
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another game that turns all the spiders into...

350
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:39,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It turns them into like a... It's the word spider.

351
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:40,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that one before.

352
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:46,310
[SPEAKER_07]: There was another game recently that also had a mode where you actually turned them into another creature.

353
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It turned them into like squirrels or something.

354
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:52,637
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one that turned them into cats.

355
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:53,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

356
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that may have been...

357
00:25:58,531 --> 00:25:59,852
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I think that was Grounded.

358
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, Grounded was the one that turned the spiders into blobs.

359
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:05,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was another one recently.

360
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:06,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're just little blobs with eyes.

361
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,419
[SPEAKER_07]: There was another one recently.

362
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of it.

363
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

364
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

365
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's... No, it turned... The cat one is from Satisfactory.

366
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:17,488
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that one is.

367
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Deft says Lethal Company does that.

368
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki turns the spiders into the word spiders.

369
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:23,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Spiders.

370
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:27,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've seen a bunch of different things like that.

371
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:35,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, recently I saw on a Let's Game It Out video the spiders turned into cats on Satisfactory.

372
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:36,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Just cat heads.

373
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:38,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's worse.

374
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hurt cats.

375
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:39,586
[SPEAKER_07]: That's...

376
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:42,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they meow when you kill them, too.

377
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:44,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's horrible!

378
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's horrible!

379
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a spider.

380
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:49,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it's not really cats, it's spiders.

381
00:26:49,854 --> 00:26:52,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather do the spiders, to be quite honest.

382
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:53,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's that.

383
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

384
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:07,117
[SPEAKER_07]: The other point I'm really trying to make with this is that we've talked about how the industry is almost feeling like it's in a soft crash right now.

385
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:11,658
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a crash as hard as 1983, 1984 when they basically took the consoles out with it and all that.

386
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we're in that hard of a crash right now.

387
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:23,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely in a soft crash, and that's evidenced by all the layoffs we see going on.

388
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:33,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's because too many companies are putting too many eggs in the multiplayer basket, and there's not enough people that really want that.

389
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:40,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would say case in point is probably Sony's whole... Remember when Sony said they were working on, what was it, 12 live service games?

390
00:27:40,697 --> 00:27:43,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they came out and said, nope, just kidding, we're working on six.

391
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:51,063
[SPEAKER_07]: and now one of them has flopped like there's really no other way to put it you know it really kind of damages everything

392
00:27:53,646 --> 00:28:15,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope the industry is hearing this, but unfortunately, these boobs at the top that often run these things and make these types of calls only see the dollar signs that things like Fortnite and Dead by Daylight and the leaders of the game make thinking, oh, we take that template, we put it on our game, and profit.

393
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:22,480
[SPEAKER_06]: or they just do short-term profits so that the CEO's like, okay, how can I get as much money as possible?

394
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Not thinking about the company, it's just for themselves.

395
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:32,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they'll make all sorts of bad decisions or whatever to make sure that they hit their target so they get their bonuses.

396
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:37,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if people hate them, they just get fired and then move to the next company and do the same thing.

397
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:43,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's how corporations work nowadays, apparently.

398
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,773
[SPEAKER_07]: FifthDream in chat says, the amount of trash junk games that come out these days feels so much like the 80s Crash.

399
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:53,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, yeah, I mean, it just, it's big games, too.

400
00:28:53,814 --> 00:29:01,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Ubisoft, really stupid for putting the whole word of, you know, quadruple A studio in everybody's brains because...

401
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:02,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

402
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:02,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

403
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:27,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the sales that they got are deserved.

404
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:43,799
[SPEAKER_06]: They deserve the lack of sales that they got, and I hope there's a lot of refunds too, because honestly, I understand that there's teams and stuff that are working on this, but someone needs to be held accountable, and unfortunately it's not going to be the CEOs or the managers or whatever, but they are the ones accountable.

405
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,201
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew the state that the game was in when they released it.

406
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:50,364
[SPEAKER_06]: They did it anyways because they want to hit their metrics so they get their money.

407
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:52,345
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care about everybody else, and then that's it.

408
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:55,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get a couple other comments in chat and then I want to get into our gaming weeks here.

409
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:59,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But y'all are on fire in chat tonight over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

410
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:09,911
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 says, I think the crash is happening because there are too many great games and people that can normally afford to buy the games are not buying them because of the backlog of great games.

411
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, and it's also the fact when you try to make one game last forever...

412
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:17,395
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where your gaming time is going, is to that one game.

413
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, that's followed up with some comments.

414
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,958
[SPEAKER_07]: FifthDream says, my main game is Fallout 76.

415
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:23,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that old now.

416
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,764
[SPEAKER_07]: QuestBuster says, there's only so much time and money people can spread out on so many games.

417
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:37,651
[SPEAKER_07]: A few months ago, there was that research report that noted 60% of time spent gaming was games six or more years old, like Fortnite with QuestBuster there.

418
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:38,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Loki.

419
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Loki.

420
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:41,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

421
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:42,756
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you play this week?

422
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Minecraft?

423
00:30:44,157 --> 00:30:44,917
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't say!

424
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:51,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just giving you shit, but it is also an obvious, like, that game is old!

425
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:54,524
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is the classic game of the week at this point!

426
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still... There's a lot of new code in there.

427
00:30:57,387 --> 00:31:05,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, but that's still an example of a game that is getting those constant updates to keep the money kind of coming in and people hooked.

428
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:08,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And it keeps people from playing other games.

429
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:40,073
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's no different DarkSakura and Dead by Daylight myself and Diablo 4 and Final Fantasy 14 about evenly we've all got our vice somewhere like it's that's the nature of this industry that we're in right now and Bobby Blackwolf I'm going to add the final say on this because I think this is on point broken games are what you get when you rely too much on chat GPT yes

430
00:31:45,230 --> 00:32:07,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never encourage the vandalizing of gaming studios I would never encourage that but in a video game like let's say I was playing Jet Set Future in a video game if I had a thing of graffiti I would want to write that on the wall of where the CEO works broken games are what you get when you rely too much on chat GBT

431
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:09,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Print.

432
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:11,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that on the back of the box.

433
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that on the back of the industry.

434
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:14,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Tattoo it on the industry's ass.

435
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: On that note, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

436
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:23,067
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you play this week, broken or not?

437
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,669
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

438
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of minimal.

439
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:43,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Pollya, I played Dead by Daylight, but I didn't really play much of anything else because Rosh Hashanah happened, and then, you know, Fuck It Friday happened, and then...

440
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:47,214
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

441
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:30,102
[SPEAKER_01]: um so I I haven't really felt like because most of the stuff I play is on stream so I haven't really felt like putting on my headphones and I'm on Benadryl so I haven't really felt like playing anything but um you know just just doing the usual maybe a couple of um like easy SNES games I've been playing too and of course a Suika game so nice all right Loki how was your gaming week

442
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:46,649
[SPEAKER_07]: um well as you said it was just Minecraft but there were some things I did I promise I'm not being shady you do you do actually you play Minecraft a lot because you are a multimedia Minecraft producer and you do great stuff so of course you spend a lot of time playing it

443
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:49,171
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, yeah, I was testing out.

444
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:53,534
[SPEAKER_06]: They released the snapshot for the new update, so I was checking out some of that stuff.

445
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much to really say there.

446
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:56,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still very early.

447
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,798
[SPEAKER_06]: But the main thing this week was KubeCon.

448
00:33:58,858 --> 00:34:03,722
[SPEAKER_06]: So KubeCon is a virtual convention for Minecraft that's in Minecraft.

449
00:34:04,603 --> 00:34:08,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And they hold it about once a year around October, around this time.

450
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:09,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we had a booth there.

451
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:13,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we were kind of supporting that for charity, for the...

452
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:17,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to remember what the charity now is called.

453
00:34:17,653 --> 00:34:21,916
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the CubeCon charity though, but they raised like $16,000 for all that.

454
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:23,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wow, I love that though.

455
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:25,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, that's pretty fun.

456
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:28,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have like a virtual booth so you can visit, they have like talks.

457
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:31,282
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so fucking adorable, like I love that.

458
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:37,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what a very, how very 2020, but I also love, like I just love that concept.

459
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:47,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they build, like, they have a virtual hall and everything, and, like, you can actually, like, get a hotel room and hold parties there if you want and stuff like that.

460
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:49,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you trash it?

461
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:54,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, you can kind of break stuff and, like, redesign everything.

462
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:55,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in a sense, yes, you can.

463
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:56,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

464
00:34:58,531 --> 00:34:59,452
[SPEAKER_06]: and what else?

465
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:07,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we did that for like three days and met a lot of people and just, you know, hung out and played some of the games that they had there and stuff.

466
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:09,176
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was all right.

467
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:10,416
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds fun.

468
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,437
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

469
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:19,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if that's it for your gaming week, we'll go to my gaming week, which was quite a bit of Diablo 4 because the expansion is out on Tuesday.

470
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:23,923
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can believe it, it's already here and the current season ends tomorrow.

471
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:27,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I'm really...

472
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:28,826
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

473
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:51,529
[SPEAKER_07]: and some of the companion builds you can do in that game where like, you know, the dogs are doing all the fighting for you.

474
00:35:51,629 --> 00:36:02,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, you know, Druid kind of has something like that, but boy, Druids get squishy towards the end game and I'm getting one hit killed and it is frustrating the hell out of me.

475
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm finally kind of

476
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:06,240
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

477
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:23,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's play a mode where if I die, it's over.

478
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:28,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played Hardcore, which is the first time I've done in Diablo 4 actually this entire time.

479
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:33,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did a Barbarian and I'm specifically doing like a Thorns build that makes it very hard for you to die.

480
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:35,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's been kind of fun.

481
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:42,676
[SPEAKER_07]: But I only got that up to about level 35 before I just decided I was just going to suck it up with the Druid and finish off the season.

482
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:46,219
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the expansion is out this week and I'm very excited about it.

483
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,281
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I've been doing is retro games.

484
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:53,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I made good on my promise last week to dive into playing and streaming some retro games.

485
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of being a little sly about what was the game I was going to do first.

486
00:36:58,227 --> 00:37:09,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Balloon Fight was the game I played first, which was, of course, a reason why I love to pick that game first is because that was the game that Iwata worked on before he was the CEO of Nintendo.

487
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:16,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I love that concept of like a lot of the great names you know from Nintendo's history were kind of involved in

488
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:18,779
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:37:33,226 --> 00:37:37,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually shows you what rank you are on the leaderboard as you play and I was never able to get to one.

490
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to one when we were on stream.

491
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played that and then I let the chat vote on what we did next.

492
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:45,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So we played Pimbot, the 8-bit version of Pimbot, for better or for worse.

493
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,897
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some things that that translation did very well.

494
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:49,358
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some things that translation did kind of...

495
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

496
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:32,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I played start to finish in one stream it took me about four and a half hours and I shit you not probably the last hour and a half of that was me struggling on level nine because I could not remember where anything was and that level is nasty because there's like essentially warps all over or like those rooms where it's like oh if you go down this ladder and go up that you turn out in a completely different place it just took me forever to find my way around that but I got there eventually and beat it

497
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:56,852
[SPEAKER_07]: so that felt really good so yeah if you want to see the archives I'm trying to build up YouTube again with some of the archives so Rob Roberts Plays on YouTube Rob Roberts Plays just Rob Roberts on Twitch but Rob Roberts Plays on YouTube alright that was pretty much it for my gaming week next week Diablo 4 expansion and more retro I can already tell you I know what games I want to play next

498
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:24,886
[SPEAKER_06]: um let's get into some more gaming news I don't have anything else to talk about here at the top of the show so let's get into some more gaming news Loki you want to start us off yes so Microsoft is now uh turned to asking game devs why don't you like us why won't you make Xbox games come on guys we're cool why won't you do that um so they're actually now um trying to uh

499
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:32,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I send out surveys to different developers asking them, hey, if you're making video games, we're interested in hearing from you.

500
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:37,949
[SPEAKER_06]: If you aren't on Xbox, we'd love to know why.

501
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:43,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, if you're using our competitors' products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from.

502
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:48,094
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hoping to gain fresh perspectives and avoid becoming an echo chamber.

503
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bit like testing players who play games like yours.

504
00:39:52,617 --> 00:40:01,283
[SPEAKER_06]: They're your target audience and you want to hear fresh perspectives because their expectations may differ from folks who are deep in your community.

505
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:08,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, there are some obvious possible answers for that.

506
00:40:09,148 --> 00:40:10,429
[SPEAKER_06]: One being that, you know,

507
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:21,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Pass isn't really promoting players to basically buy Xbox hardware but not games.

508
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Low hardware sales.

509
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:31,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Also requiring games to be released on both the Xbox Series S and X might pose a problem as well.

510
00:40:32,155 --> 00:40:32,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

511
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes out of this if we ever hear anything because, I mean, Microsoft's going to be getting the information.

512
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt they'll be sharing it.

513
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:46,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, we found out the devs don't like us because our consoles suck.

514
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:48,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the list of top 10 reasons.

515
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,637
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked 100 people and the top 7 are on the board.

516
00:40:54,125 --> 00:41:03,370
[SPEAKER_06]: They really like the ray tracing that's on the Sony PlayStation 5, and they really like the wireless motion controls of the Switch controller.

517
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're not going to come out and say all that stuff.

518
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's not going to happen.

519
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:11,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it does come off as a little bit desperate, but at the same time,

520
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

521
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:13,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

522
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:36,743
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think it is?

523
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:39,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Xbox Series S is a serious thing.

524
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:41,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's that.

525
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:45,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've heard people say they should just drop support for that, but here's the thing.

526
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:50,714
[SPEAKER_07]: The Series S is a big part of the reason why Microsoft is doing as well as they are right now.

527
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:59,982
[SPEAKER_07]: It does make an attractive budget console to allow people to play next-gen games without necessarily having to drop $700 on a PS5 Pro in order to do it.

528
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they may just have to stream it, like have it so that the Xbox Series S supports these games, but only in streaming.

529
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:19,531
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, though, that that communication to players, it's going to be a little bit convoluted, I guess, and there could be a lot of confusion on the consumer side.

530
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:29,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also very much of the mindset, if you're making games for the Switch still, you can make a game for the Xbox Series S. Like, the S is still more powerful than a Nintendo Switch, which is still...

531
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:34,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, going all this time later, we still do not have a Switch successor.

532
00:42:34,798 --> 00:42:36,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of development is on the Switch successor now.

533
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that is the worst kept secret of all the trust me bro people out there.

534
00:42:41,564 --> 00:42:47,789
[SPEAKER_06]: That said though, like the Switch successor probably going to be about as powerful as an Xbox Series S, I would imagine.

535
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:49,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's a very good point.

536
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,691
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very good point.

537
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:54,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and we know, we already know the Nintendo Switch successor is...

538
00:42:55,595 --> 00:43:13,157
[SPEAKER_07]: is very likely to sell oodles and oodles like they're gonna have to like really have a screwy price or like fuck this up colossally somehow I just don't see that happening I really don't like we're not gonna have a Wii U situation there's a reason everybody's calling this the Switch 2

539
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:18,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, even though that's probably not going to be the name, Nintendo knows the formula that works now.

540
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you think about it, the Wii U was really the first step in that direction.

541
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It just wasn't there yet.

542
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nintendo knows the formula now and they're not going to deviate from it.

543
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mike Deft says people are buying a Series S not because they want the greatest graphics.

544
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:36,832
[SPEAKER_07]: They want it to be able to play games.

545
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:39,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that's it at the end of the day.

546
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:49,137
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S has some other suggestions in chat here talking about get rid of the Series S or at least make it with the same specs as the X with half the memory and storage.

547
00:43:49,637 --> 00:43:53,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that, and you could probably do that to an extent with how technology is getting cheaper.

548
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:59,100
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably release a stronger version of the Xbox Series S. What about all the people that already have one?

549
00:44:00,984 --> 00:44:14,965
[SPEAKER_07]: that's that's where you start to walk a slippery slope and I again I'm gonna say if you're developing for Nintendo you can develop for a Series S but you know yeah once you get past a certain point it gets harder and harder that's for sure um

550
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,071
[SPEAKER_07]: No more day one releases of games.

551
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:22,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Stagger the release of first party games to get people and buy an Xbox.

552
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:27,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the Xbox team actually work and do what works and upper management should let them be.

553
00:44:27,554 --> 00:44:28,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that I will agree with.

554
00:44:29,314 --> 00:44:31,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, that's for sure.

555
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: The day one releases of games, that's a tricky one because they really want Game Pass.

556
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,537
[SPEAKER_07]: They really want Game Pass to be a thing.

557
00:44:40,017 --> 00:44:41,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would agree...

558
00:44:42,358 --> 00:45:04,666
[SPEAKER_07]: to an extent they ought to try a little more the movie formula and let something cook for a little while maybe six months on the market before they move it on to game pass but I fully understand the game pass is going to lose a lot of value if you do that and it's going to be harder to justify these price increases for game pass so they need to get more old shit on game pass

559
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:27,866
[SPEAKER_06]: right and that's why they're pushing the highest tier now is where you can get those day one games not any of the lower tiers so that's why they're doing that still it's because of the additional revenue that they're going to get from that and yeah some games aren't day one on Game Pass and then they eventually come to that later on but I think they have to do it that way right now

560
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I have a question about Game Pass.

561
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:32,012
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a while ago in chat.

562
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,634
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk, sorry, this was like 20 minutes ago.

563
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:40,018
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 said a while ago, Starfield is a great single player game.

564
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:43,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And that did make me think about that expansion for Starfield that came out.

565
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,322
[SPEAKER_07]: You may or may not be aware, Starfield got an expansion.

566
00:45:46,722 --> 00:45:56,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And my understanding is Bethesda is trying to respond to some of the criticism Starfield got about the, yeah, it has a thousand planets, but it's a thousand soulless planets.

567
00:45:56,749 --> 00:45:58,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm generalizing the criticism.

568
00:45:59,271 --> 00:46:05,756
[SPEAKER_07]: What they tried to do with this expansion is they handmade one planet.

569
00:46:06,457 --> 00:46:07,738
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an intent behind that, Loki.

570
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:17,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to make it feel like a Fallout or Elder Scrolls type of game because it's designed with intent so the exploration feels a little more meaningful.

571
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:35,400
[SPEAKER_07]: it's almost like they didn't need all those extra planets is what it sounds like that's exactly what I'm saying is the main criticism of the game as it was but they're trying to shift things a little bit I have heard good things about the expansion but my curiosity is did they put the expansion on Game Pass or no?

572
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:42,666
[SPEAKER_06]: because I'm thinking they didn't I might get a discount but yeah, I don't know interesting

573
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:44,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know

574
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:14,039
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 says the graphics race is over now.

575
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time to make great games.

576
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:20,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree mostly.

577
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:26,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be very interesting to see how the PlayStation 5 Pro ultimately does.

578
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:35,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I really feel like gaming media, a lot of sites, the big sites online, they keep pushing this whole, oh, the PS5 Pro is up to supporting 60 games now.

579
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at all this stuff the PS5 Pro can do.

580
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:43,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still kind of sitting here going, I don't think that's going to necessarily translate into sales.

581
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:58,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I still feel like that bar is way too high on the PlayStation 5 Pro to really... But if that system does sell well, then that's going to say, yeah, people do still really care about graphics.

582
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:10,219
[SPEAKER_07]: But you look at a lot of shit that's popular today, Minecraft, Among Us, Vampire Survivor, none of these games are known for their graphics.

583
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

584
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:16,761
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as the gameplay is rock fucking solid, people are gonna show up.

585
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:19,483
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I think it's a little bit of both.

586
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:23,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a really pretty game can draw people to your game.

587
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:33,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's why Final Fantasies are still a mainstay of the JRPG genre, even when they do games that are quite mediocre, quite frankly, like XV.

588
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Some would argue XVI is kind of mediocre too.

589
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: XVI...

590
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:41,419
[SPEAKER_07]: 16 is a little more upset.

591
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:42,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Peaks and Valleys.

592
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,741
[SPEAKER_07]: 16 is a little more of a case of Peaks and Valleys for me.

593
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:52,284
[SPEAKER_07]: The opening, the demo, I'm telling you, if you've never played the first three hours of 16, there's a demo on PS5.

594
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:54,165
[SPEAKER_07]: That same demo is now on PC.

595
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:56,166
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a peak for 16.

596
00:48:56,947 --> 00:49:00,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Play that because that's about as high of a peak as that game gets.

597
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:06,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that the rest is bad, but there's some really good parts still, but it kind of goes Peaks and Valleys, Peaks and Valleys, Peaks and Valleys.

598
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reading more.

599
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,861
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk says Shattered Space DLC is beautiful.

600
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:15,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I have heard it is a very good looking game.

601
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:23,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Def says Game Pass opens the door for someone trying something new and that they probably wouldn't get otherwise.

602
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:23,123
100%.

603
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:32,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That way, like you're saying, interest will decrease and either you buy the game day one because you really want it or like I said, just wait for a sale at that point.

604
00:49:33,185 --> 00:50:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: uh DJ Ranma S says interest isn't going to wane let's be real if Microsoft said they were going to release their titles to Game Pass 30 days after release it's not going to be an issue at all what happens with a game now this was not a Microsoft game but what happens with a game like Concord a game that flops in seven days but see Concord's biggest problem is it should have been a Game Pass game I know wrong company you all know I understand but let's be real Concord should have been a Game Pass game

605
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Concord should have been a Sony Game Pass game for Microsoft.

606
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:07,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that makes no sense.

607
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:08,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

608
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:09,068
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no sense.

609
00:50:09,348 --> 00:50:11,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what that is.

610
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:14,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So it should have been a PlayStation Plus giveaway game.

611
00:50:14,495 --> 00:50:14,956
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll say that.

612
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:17,773
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

613
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:19,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about Nintendo.

614
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:43,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can go and watch those games, but spoiler alert, if you're going to go looking for these speedruns, be prepared.

615
00:50:43,704 --> 00:50:44,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiler, spoiler, spoilers.

616
00:50:45,404 --> 00:50:52,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, a Twitch streamer by the name of OnakuTV got through the game in 52 minutes and 51 seconds.

617
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:56,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, a sub-50 is within reach.

618
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:01,111
[SPEAKER_07]: And the article I'm peeking at is from Wednesday, so for all I know, they've already gotten under 50.

619
00:51:01,912 --> 00:51:04,113
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty impressive for a game that just came out.

620
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:04,533
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

621
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:30,737
[SPEAKER_07]: apparently it also doesn't surprise me because apparently some of the things people are saying about echoes of wisdom is that certain echoes like break the game like certain echoes are like like um it's even coming across my TikTok I saw a TikTok that was like if you get the spider in the first area that spider thing lets you go anywhere you can climb up walls and do like whatever and it's very and then apparently the bed is the most powerful item in the entire game that's what I'm hearing

622
00:51:31,377 --> 00:51:32,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So but it's it's interesting.

623
00:51:32,978 --> 00:51:47,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and honestly, it's not out of character with the more recent big budgets or big budget looking Zelda games, because I feel like a lot of those other they're they're easily solvable with certain tricks with the magnets and the things that are available in that game, too.

624
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's it's on it's on theme.

625
00:51:52,473 --> 00:52:19,061
[SPEAKER_07]: apparently also contributing to why this game is getting by so quick there is a sequence breaking warp glitch and if you want to know more about that it is on reddit in rspeedrun but warning that will involve visiting reddit in its current form but you do you do I don't know how much I want to say but you summon a particular echo after completing the first dungeon and you do a warp mechanic that takes you right to the end so you know

626
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, is that any different from Super Mario Bros.

627
00:52:23,068 --> 00:52:23,929
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 and the warp whistles?

628
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:24,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

629
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a different way of doing it.

630
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So check that out if you want.

631
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:38,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the Zelda Echoes of Wisdom front, apparently there is a way that you can actually exploit a glitch.

632
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:43,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could be cloaked Link in the very beginning of Echoes of Wisdom.

633
00:52:44,238 --> 00:52:46,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So minor spoiler, but it is the very beginning.

634
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:48,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to play as Cloak Link.

635
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, of course, somebody figured out here's how to play the entire game as Cloaked Link.

636
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:59,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, once you get through the first dungeon, you do a very similar type of glitch.

637
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And once you get to the game over screen, you restart the game as Link rather than Zelda, which, you know, kind of ruins the whole purpose because now you have Link's weapons, the sword, the shield, arrows, bombs.

638
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Your progress is completely reset, but, you know,

639
00:53:17,223 --> 00:53:17,563
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

640
00:53:43,072 --> 00:53:48,977
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

641
00:54:06,983 --> 00:54:15,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, so there's a lot more going on with Ubisoft and their stock in particular.

642
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:21,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Their shares have jumped more than 30% as of this past Friday.

643
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:34,208
[SPEAKER_01]: This is following some reports that Tencent and the Gamalt family are considering doing a full buyout.

644
00:54:36,449 --> 00:54:45,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now they are minority stakeholders and they've been working on trying to stabilize the company after, of course, it lost half of its market share.

645
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now their shares have surged up 33.5% to $15.57 a share.

646
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:28,020
[SPEAKER_01]: now they've been trying to reach out for comment Ubisoft and Tencent did not say anything but I don't know I think that this is them trying to prevent the company leaving the family which means we'd be stuck with Gimel forever ever but I mean

647
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:31,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little bit more to add to it.

648
00:55:31,906 --> 00:55:32,707
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

649
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very interesting that this is on the table.

650
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:44,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, as much as I hate it, from their perspective, they're meaning the Gimans, it is the very logical counter move here.

651
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:51,979
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also shows that there is some very, like, there is credibility to this notion that people...

652
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:53,679
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

653
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:24,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I would want to save it.

654
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:29,445
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just going to throw that little bit out there.

655
00:56:29,865 --> 00:56:32,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, again, from their perspective, I get it.

656
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,026
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's it is a lot.

657
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just I'm surprised that this that what's going on is serious enough that they are considering that countermeasure.

658
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:47,491
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just kind of surprising, because I think last week when we were talking about it was kind of like, oh, you know, it's an activist.

659
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:48,751
[SPEAKER_07]: He's only got 10 percent.

660
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:49,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

661
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:51,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It's happening, but it's probably not going to go anywhere.

662
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:52,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

663
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:52,582
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

664
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:52,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe...

665
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:40,335
[SPEAKER_07]: as much as I keep saying he needs to be done maybe the solution is that they do take Ubisoft and then Ubisoft can rot that's it like and that sucks I'm sorry for the people that work there there's a lot of hard-working people you know that just but it's just one of those at that point I just don't know that I would ever be able to buy a game from them ever again yeah I mean

666
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:44,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of anything that I've really purchased from them in a while.

667
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:46,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I don't think will be hard to do.

668
00:57:49,337 --> 00:57:49,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

669
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:50,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's a boycott.

670
00:57:50,939 --> 00:57:53,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I played an Assassin's Creed game on Game Pass.

671
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey on Game Pass.

672
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:58,704
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the last Ubisoft game I think I actually played.

673
00:57:59,825 --> 00:58:02,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Avatar game that I had already paid for.

674
00:58:04,709 --> 00:58:06,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I super love it.

675
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.

676
00:58:08,091 --> 00:58:08,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great game.

677
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:10,213
[SPEAKER_03]: But

678
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:12,857
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

679
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:14,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on.

680
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:17,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about maybe things happening to smaller labels.

681
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:18,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

682
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:28,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, so Devolver Digital has launched a big fan games label for indie developed licensed games.

683
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:34,697
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to licensed games, they say we think there's room for a new approach, one where indie developers get to make the call.

684
00:58:36,037 --> 00:58:39,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So that could be a variety of properties.

685
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:48,562
[SPEAKER_06]: They said from a team that Dune, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings, Hellboy, Evil Dead, John Wick, Blair Witch, Power Rangers, and more.

686
00:58:49,542 --> 00:59:13,398
[SPEAKER_06]: um that sounds interesting I'd be curious to see like some smaller indie studios take on some of these titles that said however not all indie studios producing licensed games works out great like Golem or uh that King Kong game that came out

687
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:41,663
[SPEAKER_06]: King Kong Skull Island so they're not all going to be winners but I would assume that Devolver Digital has a lot more quality control than say some of these other studios so I would trust them a little more than somebody can step in and say yo a King Kong game in 2024 probably not it somebody can step in and say maybe you shouldn't alright yeah

688
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,553
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

689
01:00:01,252 --> 01:00:21,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll play with y'all He still owes me a game of Dead by Daylight I'm going to have to cash that in because I think I bought it for him on Steam it was like $6 or $7 during a sale and I was like now you have no excuse but I played Foam Stars on the street and again the game's not bad where the mistake was made was charging money up front for it once it was off it's

690
01:00:22,654 --> 01:00:23,555
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

691
01:00:51,721 --> 01:00:58,010
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry spoke loud and clear and I think Foamstar's initial I don't want to say flop but initial kind of

692
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:06,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Soft Floop on the Pillow in regards to what it made in the marketplace is a testament to that.

693
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now Foam Stars is officially free to play.

694
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:15,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to go in there and check it out now on PlayStation 4 and 5, you can go in.

695
01:01:15,815 --> 01:01:19,937
[SPEAKER_07]: That also means you do not need PlayStation Plus, which is another huge change.

696
01:01:20,297 --> 01:01:25,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Being that it is now in the free-to-play category, you actually don't need PS Plus to be able to play it online.

697
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,901
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be a huge game changer for some people.

698
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:38,892
[SPEAKER_07]: If you did buy the game originally, you get a legacy gift with 12 color variant Bubble Beastie skins, whatever that is, a new slideboard design, and a legacy title in the game.

699
01:01:39,593 --> 01:01:41,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all available to people who had the game originally.

700
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:45,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that is open to all.

701
01:01:45,538 --> 01:01:48,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, Foam Stars was kind of like Splatoon, but...

702
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

703
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:38,557
[SPEAKER_07]: but I would say it's worth a look especially now that it's free to play so this is a good call for the game we'll just see if it's too little too late because I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of people talking about Foam Stars after this week it needs to build up the community it needs to build up the streams and all that type of stuff for people to give a hoot about Foam Stars so we'll see what happens in the next week DarkSakura, what do you have next for us?

704
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this and that.

705
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:49,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Predominantly, apparently something wanting me to sell all of my stuff to them.

706
01:02:51,227 --> 01:03:01,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there is going to be an unofficial Genesis or Mega Drive port of Ladder House.

707
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:26,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Monster Bath Games that did Death Wish Enforcers and Guard Grave have been putting aside their own stuff to do a fan-made port of Splatterhouse and they were going to be using the Scorpion engine to bring the arcade version over

708
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:31,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think it'll be interesting.

709
01:03:31,992 --> 01:03:36,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the only thing that came out for Mega Drive was Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3.

710
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:37,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Those did get official releases.

711
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be pretty fun.

712
01:03:39,978 --> 01:03:42,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope no one, you know, sends them a C&D.

713
01:03:43,642 --> 01:03:45,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, Splatterhouse.

714
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:51,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, an appropriate piece of news for October, that's for sure.

715
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

716
01:03:57,226 --> 01:04:02,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, Splatterhouse also got a release for Analog Pocket.

717
01:04:04,124 --> 01:04:04,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

718
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:05,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

719
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:07,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed that.

720
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's see.

721
01:04:10,698 --> 01:04:13,999
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, it's definitely impressive the little bit I saw of it.

722
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprised it never made it to Genesis or Mega Drive.

723
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:16,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

724
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that was a licensing or system rights holder related reason why.

725
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:26,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Because 2 and 3 would have been after the TurboGrafx was kind of off the market, right?

726
01:04:27,904 --> 01:04:28,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

727
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

728
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:32,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's why.

729
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:34,382
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

730
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:41,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, going from ports to other things that we know companies don't like, right, Loki?

731
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:42,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

732
01:04:43,387 --> 01:04:47,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo has gone after yet another Switch emulator.

733
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:56,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ryujinx is now actually CCing to offer their emulator downloads.

734
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:01,276
[SPEAKER_06]: and have removed the code along with that.

735
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:15,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, yesterday, GDK Chan, who is the Ryu Jinx creator, was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of.

736
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:34,690
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as while waiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement the organization has been removed I think it's safe to say we know what the outcome is so basically they said take it down or we're going to sue you essentially I think and so not wanting to fight a lawsuit you know

737
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, once on the internet, always on the internet, right?

738
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:40,663
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true.

739
01:05:40,764 --> 01:05:48,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's not going to be getting any more updates or anything like that unless, you know, someone forks the code for that or backed up all that stuff, which they may have.

740
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

741
01:05:49,605 --> 01:05:51,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see.

742
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: but the tricky part is when it comes to new games like yes we can talk about games preservation that's important and yes we can talk about homebrew that's important but the reality is when Nintendo is actively selling Switch stuff including like Echoes of Wisdom right and other things that are going to be their major holiday titles and how Nintendo is making its money this holiday season Nintendo is going to actively shut this shit down especially when they see whether

743
01:06:39,694 --> 01:06:48,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Intentional or not, it goes back to that whole rule of sometimes the truth doesn't matter, it's what's perceived that matters.

744
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:56,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you have that emulator next to Echoes of Wisdom, ready to download now, that perception?

745
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:58,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Not good.

746
01:06:59,423 --> 01:07:25,035
[SPEAKER_07]: and Nintendo's gonna go after that because they see that as an attack on their wallet and their rights and all that stuff which I mean when it comes to like stuff that they kind of have a right to do that you know I want to support emulators and again I stand by everything I said on the last video like modders have done so and I put emulator designers in with like the modder community and this have done so much for the community especially when it comes to game preservation and playing these games that would otherwise be lost to time

747
01:07:25,635 --> 01:07:54,120
[SPEAKER_07]: but maybe you just kind of have to keep that a little bit close to your chest until Nintendo moves on to the next system which to be fair Nintendo has waited way too long to do and I think that's what's made this very interesting well people would say well Rob the Switch is still selling and I would say you have a point but yeah what's making this very interesting is that of course the Switch is being emulated it's been on the market for nine fucking years

748
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,963
[SPEAKER_06]: 9 years and also the hardware wasn't very powerful to begin with.

749
01:07:58,023 --> 01:08:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, for example, now they have, you know, with the developer was working on iOS ports of the emulator.

750
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:09,572
[SPEAKER_06]: They had an Android port that's already running Mario Kart 8.

751
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:10,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

752
01:08:10,413 --> 01:08:13,455
[SPEAKER_06]: So like the fact that you can run Mario Kart 8 on a phone.

753
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:18,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, Nintendo hates that.

754
01:08:19,424 --> 01:08:21,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, they're going to shut it down.

755
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:32,913
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's also a sign that this is why Nintendo needs to step it up on their hardware and get to the next system because this is not going away for them.

756
01:08:33,354 --> 01:08:41,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, they're going to get it taken down publicly, but I guarantee, I guarantee, A, that code has been forked.

757
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:59,772
[SPEAKER_07]: B, there are Discord servers running underground where people are still editing, updating, changing, and making that code work so that when the day comes when Nintendo moves on to the next system and they don't have their eyes on the Switch original anymore, they're going to go put that a little more out there.

758
01:08:59,792 --> 01:09:00,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, look at this.

759
01:09:00,313 --> 01:09:01,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, hey, look at this.

760
01:09:03,315 --> 01:09:03,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

761
01:09:05,154 --> 01:09:12,186
[SPEAKER_07]: or actually when it'll be when the support for the original Switch gets pulled.

762
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:14,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Which will happen someday.

763
01:09:14,657 --> 01:09:16,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Wii U. Look at 3DS.

764
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:18,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll happen someday.

765
01:09:19,019 --> 01:09:25,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the Switch support inevitably gets pulled, here's the emulator we've been working on in secret this whole time.

766
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point, they're going to be heroes in every regard because, yay, game preservation.

767
01:09:30,322 --> 01:09:30,802
[SPEAKER_07]: You did it.

768
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:39,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You made it so that all these... I mean, maybe the Switch 2 will be backwards compatible with all the Switch stuff so it will feel like less of a need.

769
01:09:40,168 --> 01:10:05,392
[SPEAKER_07]: but um there's still gonna be you know there's gonna be games that just for whatever reason the online servers get pulled or whatever let's say something like Mario Maker 2 the online servers get pulled or whatever and they're lost to time if it's not for emulators and other ways of uh running these types of things all right anyway let's move on DarkSakura so um

770
01:10:08,693 --> 01:10:09,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, no, it's me.

771
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:10,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

772
01:10:12,678 --> 01:10:13,358
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

773
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:17,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I originally had given you this story, and then I was like, I think she'd like the Splatterhouse one better.

774
01:10:18,984 --> 01:10:21,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do like the Splatterhouse one.

775
01:10:21,106 --> 01:10:21,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

776
01:10:22,548 --> 01:10:23,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, you had this one, though.

777
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:25,651
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why my brain was like, you're talking about it.

778
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:26,232
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, you're not.

779
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

780
01:10:27,053 --> 01:10:28,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, shouldn't I be talking about...

781
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:32,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that never came to pass?

782
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:34,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we will get to that shortly.

783
01:10:34,169 --> 01:10:38,475
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, let's talk about something that is coming to pass, whether you like it or not.

784
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:43,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new arcade one-up machine, like the ones I have behind me as we're broadcasting live.

785
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:45,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Except this one is not a game.

786
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:47,227
[SPEAKER_07]: in the traditional sense.

787
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:50,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade 1-Up is putting out a claw machine.

788
01:10:51,349 --> 01:10:52,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they are.

789
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess you know what to get your husband for Christmas.

790
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I already joked with him.

791
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, Alan, do I need to get you a claw machine for Christmas?

792
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:01,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And his reaction was, absolutely not.

793
01:11:02,932 --> 01:11:04,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan knows what to get me.

794
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:07,513
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?

795
01:11:07,553 --> 01:11:09,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We just don't have the room in this place.

796
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:10,234
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had a different place.

797
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:10,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not that I do either.

798
01:11:11,294 --> 01:11:12,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but...

799
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:17,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade1Up is actually going to be putting out a claw machine.

800
01:11:18,019 --> 01:11:20,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a 66 inch high machine.

801
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,522
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to cost $499 and pre-sales have begun.

802
01:11:26,043 --> 01:11:28,405
[SPEAKER_07]: The claw machine actually has different modes.

803
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:32,507
[SPEAKER_07]: There is easy mode, normal mode, and scam mode.

804
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:33,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha pun.

805
01:11:49,665 --> 01:12:16,127
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah but that for like the claw machine it actually comes with 12 of those so if you if you have parties regularly this is the type of thing that like a party like people that host corporate parties and stuff should have one of these on the dolly because that would be a really fun thing I think people would be into for parties do that do I need one in my house I don't know about that but no I do no I no I certainly do not and I'll just come over and play it all the time

806
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:19,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Jokes on you, I set mine to scam mode.

807
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:25,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time you play, I say, give me a dollar.

808
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:29,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you open the capsule, there's a piece of paper in it.

809
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:32,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you open the piece of paper, it says F-U-K-U.

810
01:12:37,685 --> 01:12:39,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you can open it up and be like, Rab!

811
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:41,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

812
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,260
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crap.

813
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's just going to be nothing but a mile long sheet.

814
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:56,167
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a CVS receipt piece of paper that's just covered in... You know what I would really put in those prize capsules?

815
01:12:56,647 --> 01:13:01,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I would put the fucking plushies that Alan wins from playing, or has won, but I think he stopped playing as much.

816
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:08,794
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would put the plushies that Alan actually won from playing these claw machines on whatever website he would

817
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:11,275
[SPEAKER_07]: He used to stream it when he was streaming.

818
01:13:11,315 --> 01:13:12,495
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a website.

819
01:13:12,515 --> 01:13:14,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to look at that website again.

820
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:16,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I've spent an age.

821
01:13:16,876 --> 01:13:18,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what it is.

822
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:20,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember either, and it's probably for the best that I don't.

823
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:23,878
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, check that out.

824
01:13:24,018 --> 01:13:28,519
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are that into claw machines, you can now have your very own.

825
01:13:28,599 --> 01:13:30,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think it's really funny, to be honest.

826
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:35,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Pod Culture says $500 and it doesn't even have prizes.

827
01:13:36,016 --> 01:13:38,758
[SPEAKER_07]: The prizes were the friends we lost along the way.

828
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:42,860
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

829
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move back to a simpler time and a time when things didn't even happen.

830
01:13:47,643 --> 01:13:56,048
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're going to do the segment called the Classic Game of the Week, but once a month in the year 2024, DarkSakura tells us about a game that actually never happened.

831
01:13:56,088 --> 01:13:58,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a figment of your imagination.

832
01:13:58,629 --> 01:13:59,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get to the bumper.

833
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:17,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

834
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:20,618
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

835
01:14:22,581 --> 01:14:26,243
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for the cancelled game of the month?

836
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:46,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked Sonic Xtreme Yep, Sonic Xtreme It was a platformer that was developed by Sega Technical Institute starting in 1994 until it was cancelled in 1996 It was initially supposed to be the first fully 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game

837
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:49,998
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring Sonic into the modern era.

838
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:56,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the only original, sorry, the first original Sonic game for Sega Saturn.

839
01:14:58,305 --> 01:15:09,394
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically were following Sonic on his ship to keep Eggman from stealing six magic rings from a character literally called Tiara Bubowski.

840
01:15:09,855 --> 01:15:10,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Boob-owski.

841
01:15:11,276 --> 01:15:11,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And her father.

842
01:15:12,597 --> 01:15:13,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubowski.

843
01:15:13,077 --> 01:15:13,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.

844
01:15:14,898 --> 01:15:37,808
[SPEAKER_01]: you had open levels that rotated around a fixed sphere center area and you could get rings and it was supposed to be pretty fast but it was initially conceived as a side-scrolling game for the Genesis that was supposed to succeed Sonic & Knuckles and then Sega did their little shifteroo to the 32X and the game came with it

845
01:15:38,308 --> 01:16:02,169
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they worked on it for Saturn in Windows and then it got completely redesigned again to be intended to be released for the 1996 holiday season but you know stuff happens and there was a a visit by the Japanese Sega executives there were problems with game engines

846
01:16:03,918 --> 01:16:17,553
[SPEAKER_01]: including using one that came from Sonic Team that was used in Nights and finally with the designer and main programmer becoming sick

847
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:20,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was cancelled.

848
01:16:21,013 --> 01:16:25,214
[SPEAKER_01]: There was even a film tie-in with MGM Studios, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

849
01:16:26,575 --> 01:16:39,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead what happened is Sega released a port of Sonic 3D Blast, a Genesis game, but there was not another original Sonic game until Sonic Adventure came out on the Dreamcast.

850
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:41,730
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh,

851
01:17:12,934 --> 01:17:13,386
[SPEAKER_01]: it uh

852
01:17:15,371 --> 01:17:21,675
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the factors in here really seem like they made it into Sonic Adventure a little bit later.

853
01:17:22,235 --> 01:17:38,884
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very similar to playing Bug on Saturn, but that you had basically free roam, you had no linear path, and it used a fisheye camera system called the Reflex Lens that gives you a wide-angle view that moves around Sonic.

854
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:43,106
[SPEAKER_01]: The levels rotate around the center so that you could run up

855
01:17:43,566 --> 01:17:44,526
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

856
01:18:11,974 --> 01:18:39,783
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there were four stages that were developed before the game was cancelled like the Jade Gully, Red Sands, Galaxy Fortress and Crystal Frost there were four characters that were modeled and textured their designs were over 50 enemies and an hour of music created Fang the Sniper and Metal Sonic were considered to be for bosses

857
01:18:42,395 --> 01:18:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of stuff there were even promotional materials that were created that involved Miss Bubowski and her father Gazebo Bubowski interesting and then of course Eggman himself

858
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:21,266
[SPEAKER_01]: um so just to go a little bit more into the background uh Yuji Naka and some of the Japanese staff moved to California for the Sega Technical Institute um that wanted to combine elements and philosophy of American and Japanese game design um they worked on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 uh

859
01:19:23,488 --> 01:19:48,393
[SPEAKER_01]: there were language barriers though and there was a bit of a rift that developed but a few people came and left and so the American staff did Sonic Spinball and the Japanese staff did Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles they had experimented with 3D graphics for Sonic 3 but could not implement them because the Genesis just couldn't knock it

860
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:52,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuji Naka returned to Japan to work on Nights with Sonic Team.

861
01:19:54,939 --> 01:19:58,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, things kind of just went downhill.

862
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:04,669
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was even a statement that the Sega president...

863
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:31,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Nakayama Hayao had really pushed hard on the American executives and thought that there were some bad decisions being made and things got really political after the PlayStation came out and people were pushing blame here and there and just sort of fell apart in the aftermath but

864
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:39,946
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, I mean, there were game, just aspects of this that just went all the way through so many different revisions.

865
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:44,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it also fell into that area of developmental hell.

866
01:20:44,847 --> 01:20:56,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, when they were working on the development of Extreme, Naka came to visit and just said, good luck.

867
01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:26,276
[SPEAKER_01]: so the game was originally developed with two different game engines and they were using tools that were used in Panzer Dragoons Vi and some tools that had just been taken from a couple different other games and then they worked on making enemies and pre-rendered sprites and like I said, a lot of shifting around, a lot of idea changing and then

868
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:33,400
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the dispute going on within Sega.

869
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there's just a lot of drama.

870
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:38,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go full into the background of all of it.

871
01:21:38,805 --> 01:21:44,891
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a playable demo in May 1996 at E3.

872
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:51,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And it used the engine that was created a lot later in there by...

873
01:21:56,764 --> 01:22:04,796
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the programmers and then they had actually taken that particular engine and decided that they were going to run with that instead.

874
01:22:05,577 --> 01:22:07,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what this version was built around.

875
01:22:10,382 --> 01:22:35,392
[SPEAKER_01]: they were losing people left and right they were getting a lot of turnover and Coffin who developed that engine like I said earlier became really sick he had walking pneumonia and personally after having walking pneumonia myself yeah and the other one who became so sick they said that he had six months to live

876
01:22:36,653 --> 01:22:52,069
[SPEAKER_01]: but he recovered, I mean he's still alive but basically because the teams were just so just in such a state after all of that was going on that the decision was made to cancel the game

877
01:22:53,370 --> 01:23:00,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now, um, it was announced in 1997 that it had been canceled.

878
01:23:01,016 --> 01:23:09,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sega put more focus on, uh, Nights into Dreams and the port of Sonic 3D Blast by Traveler's Tales.

879
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:18,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic Extreme was meant to be worked into bonus stages for 3D Blast, but they really couldn't do it.

880
01:23:18,189 --> 01:23:20,771
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't transfer Sonic's model over.

881
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:29,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they worked on a version of this for the Dreamcast that did eventually become Sonic Adventure.

882
01:23:29,857 --> 01:23:34,320
[SPEAKER_01]: There are remnants of the prototype that can be seen in the game Sonic Jam.

883
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:37,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, honestly, I'm kind of a fan of Sonic Jam.

884
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:38,203
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fun.

885
01:23:38,704 --> 01:23:38,904
[SPEAKER_01]: You know,

886
01:23:39,384 --> 01:24:07,539
[SPEAKER_01]: like a play around little game so like I said there was a film that was supposed to go with it and it was supposed to be live action and animation that was based on the world of Sonic and it was supposed to be called Sonic Wonders of the World there was a treatment that had been released that had Sonic and Robotnik escaping that world into the real world where have we seen that?

887
01:24:11,092 --> 01:24:37,781
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I said they had released the port of Sonic 3D Blast and we never really saw anything from it again except that all we had for a while was the different screenshots and then there was a copy of the early test engine that was sold in 2006 and someone put out like an animated gif of the gameplay

888
01:24:38,761 --> 01:25:04,458
[SPEAKER_01]: and then finally they had worked to try to buy the disc from that collector and the disc image was leaked online July 17, 2007 and then there was a site that was built around what they were able to get from there too and then I'm trying to find where the rest of this person's name is

889
01:25:07,873 --> 01:25:37,422
[SPEAKER_01]: it was another Sonic collector there's a lot on here but at any rate he wanted to actually complete the game himself but that didn't happen so there was a site in 2015, Sonic Retro that got the extreme source code and created a playable version that featured the levels that were shown in the E3 demo and then

890
01:25:40,726 --> 01:25:51,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pushed forward into a homebrew Saturn game that was based on Xtreme called Zonic Z-Stream in March 2017.

891
01:25:54,842 --> 01:25:59,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not listed here, but one of the ones that I found some video for was a Unity rebuild.

892
01:26:00,954 --> 01:26:03,635
[SPEAKER_01]: and it looked pretty neat.

893
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:17,641
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to ZStream, they took parts of Xtreme and his ideas and then played on them a little bit and got some really good nods for creativity and trying to do what they could with it.

894
01:26:18,581 --> 01:26:19,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But there you go.

895
01:26:19,362 --> 01:26:25,664
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Unity rebuild now playing on the stream for those watching live so you can kind of see the difference.

896
01:26:25,724 --> 01:26:27,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks a little sharper, obviously, but yeah.

897
01:26:29,402 --> 01:26:39,591
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of the pop-in, which I think gives the game quite a number of opportunities of leaps of faith.

898
01:26:40,432 --> 01:26:42,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I agree with Bonds006.

899
01:26:42,914 --> 01:26:44,175
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty floaty.

900
01:26:45,536 --> 01:26:52,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played the older demo that had been released, and it was...

901
01:26:54,427 --> 01:26:55,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit hard for me.

902
01:26:56,088 --> 01:27:00,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop-up kind of screws with my head, and it really did have that in abundance.

903
01:27:01,572 --> 01:27:01,912
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

904
01:27:02,653 --> 01:27:03,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you have it.

905
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:08,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Your classic cancelled game of the month.

906
01:27:08,497 --> 01:27:11,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Sonic is not immune to being cancelled, that's for sure.

907
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:16,162
[SPEAKER_07]: But Sonic Extreme, your classically cancelled game.

908
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:18,372
[SPEAKER_07]: of the month.

909
01:27:18,972 --> 01:27:19,273
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

910
01:27:20,213 --> 01:27:26,698
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to move on and cover some other headlines here real fast with some rapid fire news.

911
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:29,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what else has been happening in gaming this week?

912
01:27:30,341 --> 01:27:40,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Parabonk Game Studio has confirmed that Saber Interactive is going to be working on a AAA RPG based off of Avatar The Last Airbender.

913
01:27:41,909 --> 01:27:47,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is, I'm assuming, targeting next year.

914
01:27:47,993 --> 01:27:53,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said they're calling it Avatar Legends or the Avatar Legends Universe.

915
01:27:55,217 --> 01:27:55,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be cool to see.

916
01:27:58,159 --> 01:27:58,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

917
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:04,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Infinite is getting a third person mode apparently next month.

918
01:28:04,931 --> 01:28:10,134
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from 343 Industries and they announced the update.

919
01:28:10,694 --> 01:28:25,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't make the show roll because it is literally a last minute story but 343 Studios has been renamed to Halo Studios and they've just announced that they're going to be working on multiple Halo titles using the Unreal 5 engine.

920
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:37,129
[SPEAKER_06]: and they showcased some of the graphics looks a lot better than when they first showed off Halo Infinite I'm going to tell you that much so look forward to more news on that coming soon

921
01:28:38,087 --> 01:28:54,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this is rapid fire, but I just wanted to dive a little bit in this because I found the third person mode thing fascinating because I think back, you know, DarkSakura, I know you don't tend to like to play games in first person because of motion sickness, although I guess EBD Killer kind of broke the mold for whatever reason.

922
01:28:54,813 --> 01:28:57,935
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still my first couple of games is killer.

923
01:28:57,975 --> 01:28:58,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little motion sick.

924
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:28,160
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm curious we joke about your relationship with Halo here in this game but you have to kind of look at this and go well that's kind of neat right like does this third person mode for Halo Infinite make you go I think it maybe could target like maybe it could target like people that play Fortnite a lot more because you know that's the same type of perspective that you have in like Fortnite I didn't think about that that's a good call out you're right it is maybe it's to like you know

925
01:29:29,091 --> 01:29:30,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that's maybe a stretch.

926
01:29:30,232 --> 01:29:35,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just people that don't like, you know, there's a lot of people that don't like first-person pure.

927
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:37,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of games have an option.

928
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:40,497
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like Mass Effect's another one that pops to mind.

929
01:29:40,517 --> 01:29:42,238
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play either way, if I remember right.

930
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:43,279
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do either way.

931
01:29:43,919 --> 01:29:47,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the Bethesda games are one as well.

932
01:29:48,402 --> 01:29:51,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So most people play those in first-person, but you don't have to.

933
01:29:51,143 --> 01:29:52,544
[SPEAKER_07]: There's third-person available there, too.

934
01:29:52,604 --> 01:29:54,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think it's interesting.

935
01:29:54,985 --> 01:29:57,006
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting development for that.

936
01:29:57,046 --> 01:29:57,186
[SPEAKER_07]: But I...

937
01:29:58,447 --> 01:29:58,707
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

938
01:30:16,554 --> 01:30:31,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a Games Done Quick fundraiser that will be helping the folks who are affected by Hurricane Helena on October 11th, starting at 6pm, and it will conclude on October 13th.

939
01:30:35,585 --> 01:30:58,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people personally who were affected by it so having that level of disaster relief will be the assistance will be really good for them the donations will be going directly to disaster I cannot make words happen it's the Benadryl it will go directly to the disaster relief

940
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:28,297
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm pretty pretty excited about it um I hope everyone tunes in and contributes whatever you can to help out yeah they're putting this together real fast too because I think the speedruns uh submissions are due in like an hour I guess I better work on my Zelda speedrun no but I think in all seriousness the speedrun submissions are due in an hour um and you know I you know we know Games Done Quick can do virtual stuff now so it is night because pretty infamously um

941
01:31:29,798 --> 01:31:33,419
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Gamestone Quick really only does the two major marathons a year.

942
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:41,261
[SPEAKER_07]: They do other things on their own channel, you know, but pretty infamously when it comes to the fundraisers and their charities are set in stone.

943
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:46,662
[SPEAKER_07]: They always do Doctors Without Borders and they always do the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

944
01:31:46,962 --> 01:31:48,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Two very worthy causes.

945
01:31:48,742 --> 01:31:50,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think any of us want to see those taken away from.

946
01:31:51,243 --> 01:31:56,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is really cool that the organization is doing this kind of like bonus stage, if you will.

947
01:31:56,864 --> 01:31:57,665
[SPEAKER_07]: for something necessary.

948
01:31:57,925 --> 01:32:01,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm like, oh, but they do the one at Twitch, and I think they do a charity for that.

949
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:13,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are little other things that come up here and there, but for the most part... Oh, Bob Blackwell says, GDQ is doing a charity marathon this weekend for something else, so they started doing these little ones.

950
01:32:13,396 --> 01:32:17,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's cool, but obviously the Hurricane Helene...

951
01:32:18,559 --> 01:32:18,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Sucks.

952
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So people, we need a lot of support for that one.

953
01:32:23,124 --> 01:32:27,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully some big names get in on that speed running.

954
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:34,316
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S says, my friend Jamie who lives in Asheville where it was hit the hardest is safe in Myrtle Beach.

955
01:32:34,496 --> 01:32:35,577
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't lose everything.

956
01:32:35,597 --> 01:32:35,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm

957
01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:36,799
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

958
01:32:54,682 --> 01:32:55,583
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

959
01:33:13,652 --> 01:33:21,419
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously it sounds like a lot of the problem was that Hurricane Helene was doing some of its most damage in like mountainy areas and areas, not beach towns.

960
01:33:21,519 --> 01:33:25,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it damaged beach towns, but these beach towns are kind of used to hurricanes.

961
01:33:25,923 --> 01:33:26,884
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more prepared for it.

962
01:33:27,265 --> 01:33:30,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It was these other areas that weren't so prepared for it that were hit really hard.

963
01:33:30,748 --> 01:33:33,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me think of a lot of like stuff we went through.

964
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:34,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I shouldn't equate it.

965
01:33:34,631 --> 01:33:38,075
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my Florida friends sent me a picture of a boarded up Waffle House.

966
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:40,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's when you know shit's real, right?

967
01:33:40,856 --> 01:33:42,376
[SPEAKER_07]: The Walthouse Index is real.

968
01:33:42,857 --> 01:33:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I will fully admit I shouldn't equate it.

969
01:33:45,178 --> 01:33:59,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And my point with this is that climate change is a bitch, but I can't help but think of some of these West Coast storms that we were getting close to home here last year that had the 70 miles an hour winds, which I know for you East Coasters is nothing.

970
01:33:59,403 --> 01:34:03,705
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, our infrastructure is not built for this kind of shit.

971
01:34:04,225 --> 01:34:18,105
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was wreaking a lot of havoc here too with all of the downed trees last year and that type of stuff so um climate change sucks um well I even commented on it myself that I thought it was not not far off

972
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's move on.

973
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:26,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about F-Zero.

974
01:34:27,233 --> 01:34:34,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason mentioned this in the intro, and I will admit, Jason, I was not aware, and I love F-Zero, and I was not aware, or I forgot.

975
01:34:34,296 --> 01:34:39,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I was aware, but it just kind of like one of those, well, we'll never play it, that there was an F-Zero title in Japan.

976
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:41,300
[SPEAKER_07]: It was F-Zero Climax.

977
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what?

978
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:49,965
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to get to play F-Zero Climax here, legally, as all things considered, through Nintendo Switch Online.

979
01:34:51,266 --> 01:34:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: It is coming out this week on October 11th.

980
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:59,960
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack, so you have to have the, you know, Super version of Nintendo Switch Online because...

981
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:00,799

985
01:35:28,091 --> 01:35:31,052

1007
01:38:11,295 --> 01:38:17,160
[SPEAKER_07]: But these are not, I think here in the States you might associate Sunsoft with like Blaster Master and Fester's Quest.

1008
01:38:17,661 --> 01:38:18,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Not those games.

1009

01:38:55,742 --> 01:39:01,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the PlayStation 5 this week, of course, the Silent Hill 2 remake I think is getting a lot of attention.

01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:03,086
[SPEAKER_07]: That is coming out in Japan as well.

1019
01:39:03,106 --> 01:39:04,507

01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:29,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill 2 Remake obviously seems to be the tentpole this week.

1035
01:40:40,789 --> 01:40:43,711
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have a couple stories to get to first, starting with Loki.

1036
01:40:44,892 --> 01:40:56,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Epic Games has now filed a lawsuit against Samsung over their tech essentially discouraging the installation of third-party software, which is...

1037
01:40:57,165 --> 01:40:57,485
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

1038
01:41:22,991 --> 01:41:51,456
[SPEAKER_06]: and apparently they have a way to disable the autoblocker that's laid out on Epic's site but you have to go through this whole process be somewhat tech savvy to be able to actually do that to your device to get this to install it's just a big old hassle right now they haven't really proven what kind of damages they're I guess seeking but they are right now trying to at least get that so that it allows them to easily install it

1039
01:41:55,405 --> 01:42:12,675
[SPEAKER_07]: but I don't know they won against Google so maybe interesting this is only going to get messier but you know again this just goes back to Epic Epic wants Fortnite as a platform on every screen every screen every screen

1040
01:42:13,996 --> 01:42:20,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, unfortunately some sad news to take us out tonight with our last scheduled story.

1041
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:24,925
[SPEAKER_07]: That has to do with a developer stepping down from Bloodstained 2.

1042
01:42:25,905 --> 01:42:36,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Chutaro Aida, who is a veteran designer on Castlevania, was also working on Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, has stepped down and it's unfortunately due to a cancer diagnosis.

1043
01:42:37,274 --> 01:42:52,845
[SPEAKER_07]: so a hearty fuck cancer from all of us here this was a decision that was announced on social media and even though he's been involved with coming up with ideas for the game and so on he's going to be going through treatment and Koji Igarashi who of course

1044
01:42:53,385 --> 01:42:58,308
[SPEAKER_07]: You know him from being the long, long time producer of Castlevania series, him and his amazing cowboy hat.

1045
01:42:58,889 --> 01:42:59,629
[SPEAKER_07]: The man in the hat.

1046
01:42:59,729 --> 01:43:09,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, moved on to Bloodstained, and he also reposted the message on his official Twitter account, talking about his own sadness and wishing a quick recovery.

1047
01:43:09,956 --> 01:43:19,602
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to translate that into English, the message said, up until now, the DS series, meaning Castlevania series, and Bloodstained have been produced primarily by director Shataro.

1048
01:43:20,522 --> 01:43:49,690
[SPEAKER_07]: they can truly be called his works it is a great blow that he is stepping away from the project but we all do our best to make up for this we hope that he will recover soon so that we can work together again yeah that is the worst to hear about and I'm sorry to hear it but that's what you have to do step away from work so you can heal up and hopefully he will heal up fast alright with that you gotta do it if you're not yeah

1049
01:43:50,029 --> 01:43:50,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling great.

1050
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:50,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1051
01:43:51,832 --> 01:43:52,112
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1052
01:43:52,232 --> 01:43:53,975
[SPEAKER_07]: That takes us to the listener roundtable.

1053
01:43:54,135 --> 01:43:59,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So we invite your calls in the green room, but we also invite your emails here every week on the show.

1054
01:43:59,203 --> 01:44:00,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know if we have any.

1055
01:44:00,425 --> 01:44:04,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, unfortunately, we have another dry week over at participate at orange.com.

1056
01:44:07,317 --> 01:44:07,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

1057
01:44:08,478 --> 01:44:10,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I forgot to open it.

1058
01:44:11,981 --> 01:44:12,322
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1059
01:44:12,362 --> 01:44:13,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost positive there's nothing there.

1060
01:44:13,843 --> 01:44:21,329
[SPEAKER_07]: But while you double check, we need to come up with a way where people can text message us or something.

1061
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:29,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, I don't use Twitter and I don't want to use Twitter and I don't want to encourage people and I don't think there's enough people on any of the alternatives yet.

1062
01:44:29,876 --> 01:44:33,497
[SPEAKER_07]: For me to say, oh, send us a message on Mastodon or Blue Sky or anything like that.

1063
01:44:33,957 --> 01:44:38,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am open to ideas, especially from the podcast crowd.

1064
01:44:38,778 --> 01:44:43,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you listen to us throughout the week, only on the podcast, you're not here live Sunday night.

1065
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very, or on YouTube or wherever it is you find this show.

1066
01:44:46,821 --> 01:44:47,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very curious.

1067
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:53,082
[SPEAKER_07]: What would, what's an easy way, what would be an easy way for you to say, say hey to us?

1068
01:44:53,642 --> 01:44:55,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Because right now I'm thinking like a text message thing would be cool.

1069
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:01,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Spotify I think has commenting on like podcasts too.

1070
01:45:01,313 --> 01:45:01,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

1071
01:45:02,194 --> 01:45:06,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I will admit I'm not very good at checking it because I don't think it emails us.

1072
01:45:07,558 --> 01:45:10,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I also realize, you know, not everybody's on Spotify.

1073
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:11,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

1074
01:45:12,121 --> 01:45:14,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I have seen a YouTube comment or two come in.

1075
01:45:15,384 --> 01:45:18,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I guess people are starting to find us there.

1076
01:45:18,507 --> 01:45:22,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that when Google Podcasts went away, it was like, oh, yeah, YouTube.

1077
01:45:22,652 --> 01:45:23,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1078
01:45:23,372 --> 01:45:25,275
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube has a whole baked in thing over there.

1079
01:45:25,335 --> 01:45:26,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're happy to be there on YouTube.

1080
01:45:26,936 --> 01:45:31,862
[SPEAKER_07]: But then iTunes, iTunes also has the review thing.

1081
01:45:32,182 --> 01:45:34,024
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's, that's a little different from commenting.

1082
01:45:34,965 --> 01:45:40,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, if you just want to send us a note saying, hey, I've been playing this game or hey, you guys should check this out or whatever.

1083
01:45:40,832 --> 01:45:44,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm really open to how we can encourage more of that.

1084
01:45:44,896 --> 01:45:46,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwell says WhatsApp.

1085
01:45:46,638 --> 01:45:48,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you have to, isn't that kind of like tied?

1086
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:50,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be honest.

1087
01:45:51,022 --> 01:45:52,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I associate WhatsApp with scams.

1088
01:45:52,925 --> 01:46:01,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that people use it to chat with family overseas and stuff, but I associate WhatsApp with scams.

1089
01:46:01,757 --> 01:46:04,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know not a lot of people will use it because it's Facebook owned.

1090
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:08,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like, again, that's a thing where...

1091
01:46:09,409 --> 01:46:13,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people use WhatsApp, some people use Telegram, some people use Signal.

1092
01:46:13,570 --> 01:46:20,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I were to say, oh, we're taking messages on Telegram, well, then everybody who uses WhatsApp and Signal would be like, well, fuck me, right?

1093
01:46:20,972 --> 01:46:22,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm on the wrong app.

1094
01:46:25,073 --> 01:46:25,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

1095
01:46:26,893 --> 01:46:28,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question, though, about threads.

1096
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:30,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think of that one, but...

1097
01:46:32,322 --> 01:46:33,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember to post there.

1098
01:46:34,563 --> 01:46:35,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like Threads has it.

1099
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:37,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess more people are on Threads.

1100
01:46:37,923 --> 01:46:39,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifth Dream says, let's go back to ICQ.

1101
01:46:40,024 --> 01:46:40,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Truly.

1102
01:46:40,664 --> 01:46:43,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I think ICQ finally is gone, though.

1103
01:46:44,645 --> 01:46:46,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think ICQ is around anymore.

1104
01:46:46,085 --> 01:46:48,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they finally, finally went away.

1105
01:46:49,646 --> 01:46:53,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Folks can text a Google voice number and you can get emails.

1106
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:54,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's what we have to do.

1107
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:55,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1108
01:46:55,788 --> 01:46:56,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to look into that.

1109
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:57,808
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1110
01:46:57,888 --> 01:46:58,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe in the future.

1111
01:47:00,669 --> 01:47:01,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1112
01:47:03,703 --> 01:47:09,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that is going to do it for, well, let me go over to last minute stories from Loki.

1113
01:47:09,748 --> 01:47:10,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have anything else?

1114
01:47:10,448 --> 01:47:11,929
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a good one a minute ago.

1115
01:47:12,249 --> 01:47:13,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just not much.

1116
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:22,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially that Bloober team has teased that they could be working on more Konami projects after Silent Hill 2 because Konami is happy with the work the team has done.

1117
01:47:23,518 --> 01:47:25,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reception that Silent Hill 2 is getting.

1118
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:27,541
[SPEAKER_01]: It better be Silent Hill 3!

1119
01:47:27,581 --> 01:47:27,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1120
01:47:28,502 --> 01:47:29,302
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll know.

1121
01:47:29,462 --> 01:47:30,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon enough.

1122
01:47:30,904 --> 01:47:31,404
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll find out.

1123
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever happened to Silent Hill F?

1124
01:47:34,847 --> 01:47:37,789
[SPEAKER_07]: The original one, the Konami, or I'm assuming Konami Contractor.

1125
01:47:37,829 --> 01:47:38,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't that already come out?

1126
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:42,393
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's the TV show one came out.

1127
01:47:42,554 --> 01:47:48,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the one that showed like the, it was like the ancient Japan looking thing or the, like that?

1128
01:47:48,078 --> 01:47:49,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that one.

1129
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was the new Silent Hill game.

1130
01:47:52,547 --> 01:48:07,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know it's F for fuck no Orange Rite says it is still upcoming if I recall correctly I don't think you're wrong we just haven't heard anything on it in a long time but yeah different company though yeah

1131
01:48:10,069 --> 01:48:11,912
[SPEAKER_07]: FifthDream suggests IRC.

1132
01:48:12,613 --> 01:48:15,318
[SPEAKER_07]: We could take comments on IRC the way we used to.

1133
01:48:15,698 --> 01:48:22,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And was asking if the All Games channel was still around because, you know, for a while we were... No, we never did merge with that chat.

1134
01:48:22,249 --> 01:48:23,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Our chats were always separate, weren't they?

1135
01:48:25,404 --> 01:48:26,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We never did merge with that chat.

1136
01:48:27,546 --> 01:48:30,028
[SPEAKER_07]: The radio shows did, but the chats never did.

1137
01:48:30,628 --> 01:48:31,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why that was.

1138
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:35,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that all these years later, I'm not sure why that was, but don't ask me.

1139
01:48:36,072 --> 01:48:37,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It made sense at the time.

1140
01:48:37,133 --> 01:48:38,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make sense now.

1141
01:48:38,194 --> 01:48:38,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't ask.

1142
01:48:40,456 --> 01:48:45,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, well, All Games Radio went to heaven a few years ago, I believe.

1143
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:49,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think, well, maybe the IRC channel is still kicking.

1144
01:48:50,686 --> 01:48:51,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Bobby still lurking there?

1145
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:54,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby's the one that would still be lurking on IRS.

1146
01:48:54,187 --> 01:48:57,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I think he finally left that channel some time ago.

1147
01:48:58,188 --> 01:48:58,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Tigerclaw.

1148
01:48:59,548 --> 01:49:00,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Tigerclaw at?

1149
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:05,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Tigerclaw's probably... Tigerclaw, I hope he's not in the way of the hurricane.

1150
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:09,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OrangeRite says RIP co-host.

1151
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:10,571
[SPEAKER_07]: They had promise.

1152
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:17,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby says I had to shut off my BSD machine and that logged me out of all my IRC channels.

1153
01:49:18,077 --> 01:49:21,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Is anyone still in Orange Lounge on Game Surge?

1154
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:24,860
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

1155
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet somebody's got to be holding down the fort there.

1156
01:49:28,082 --> 01:49:28,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1157
01:49:28,942 --> 01:49:30,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shout out to Game Surge IRC.

1158
01:49:34,504 --> 01:49:34,905
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1159
01:49:34,965 --> 01:49:35,225
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1160
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:35,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1161
01:49:37,011 --> 01:49:38,212
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:49:55,531 --> 01:50:23,014
[SPEAKER_07]: uh let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts uh DarkSakura oh wait first uh thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out on air so uh tell a friend or two or five we appreciate it a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, uh YouTube all that goes a very long way thank you so much um all right uh DarkSakura your final thought tonight

1163
01:50:24,385 --> 01:50:30,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not streaming tonight because my eye is still threatening to swell itself shut.

1164
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:33,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a second round of Benadryl.

1165
01:50:33,673 --> 01:50:38,017
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully the one I have chosen will be acceptable.

1166
01:50:38,737 --> 01:50:39,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1167
01:50:40,298 --> 01:50:40,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll feel better.

1168
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

1169
01:50:44,522 --> 01:50:48,465
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is hopefully this week we'll get a new episode out.

1170
01:50:48,585 --> 01:50:50,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working on stuff for a very long time.

1171
01:50:50,827 --> 01:50:52,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just still being worked on.

1172
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:54,495
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you can do it.

1173
01:50:55,375 --> 01:51:01,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And my final thought is later tonight, I'm trying to keep a Monday, Wednesday, Friday thing up for my retro videos.

1174
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:04,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to do some recordings in advance tonight off stream.

1175
01:51:04,883 --> 01:51:08,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And although I guess I could have done it on if I knew you weren't going to be streaming Dark Sakura.

1176
01:51:09,427 --> 01:51:10,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, it doesn't matter now.

1177
01:51:10,788 --> 01:51:11,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know I wasn't going to be.

1178
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:12,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1179
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:12,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1180
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:14,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I would feel better by tonight.

1181
01:51:14,651 --> 01:51:18,515
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently dust mites have other decisions for my skin.

1182
01:51:18,835 --> 01:51:20,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right, because I have some errands to run.

1183
01:51:20,356 --> 01:51:21,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It still looks pretty bad, doesn't it?

1184
01:51:22,538 --> 01:51:27,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you sent me some pictures and I was like, oh gosh, I'm sorry to hear it.

1185
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:28,400
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no fun.

1186
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:33,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1187
01:51:35,582 --> 01:51:36,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

1188
01:51:37,683 --> 01:51:38,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye everybody.

1189
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:38,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.

1190
01:51:38,723 --> 01:51:39,623
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week.

1191
01:51:43,024 --> 01:51:45,465
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1192
01:51:47,566 --> 01:51:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1193
01:51:52,662 --> 01:51:53,383
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.
